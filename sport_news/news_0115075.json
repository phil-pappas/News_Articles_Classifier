(Adam Davy/PA via AP) UNITED KINGDOM OUT - NO SALES - NO ARCHIVES \nLONDON (AP) — French duo Olivier Giroud and Laurent Koscielny headed Arsenal to a 2-1 victory over Everton by seizing on porous defending twice inside two minutes in rainy London on Saturday. \nWith a fourth consecutive Premier League victory, Arsene Wenger’s team provisionally moved top of the standings ahead of Sunday’s Manchester derby. It came at the end of a week when the Gunners raised morale by stunning Bayern Munich with their first Champions League win of the season. \nA scrappy game came to life in the 36th minute when Giroud, with his back to goal, rose above Everton defender Phil Jagielka and glanced a header past Tim Howard. \nThe goalkeeper was beaten again when Koscielny flicked in his header from close range after meeting Santi Cazorla’s free kick. \nEverton had provided little goal threat until Ross Barkley pulled one back before halftime with a shot that deflected off Gabriel Paulista. \nAfter a shaky first half for Howard, the American went some way to making amending after the break by running out to block Alexis Sanchez. Only the crossbar denied Giroud a second goal with around 20 minutes to go, with Howard already beaten. \n“We should have scored another one but the luck was not with me,” said Giroud, who has scored five goals in his last four games for club and country. \nIn the final moments of the game, Everton was reduced to 10 men when Gareth Barry was shown a second yellow card for a foul on Kieran Gibbs. \nArsenal moved a point ahead of Manchester City, which is at fourth-place neighbor United on Sunday. Everton is nine points back in 10th place after three games without a win.
