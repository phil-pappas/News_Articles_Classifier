Broadneck's Ali'i Niumatalolo practices with his team on the first day of football practice. (By Joshua McKerrow / Baltimore Sun Media Group) Bob Hough Contact Reporter bhough@capgaznews.com \nIt was one of the most-asked questions heading into the high school football season. \n\"Who's he going to sign with?\" was a common question when discussing Broadneck senior linebacker Ali'i Niumatalolo. The son of Navy coach Ken Niumatalolo took a step toward making his college selection official when he announced via Twitter on Tuesday he has verbally committed to Boise State of the Mountain West Conference. \n\"After a ton of prayer and fasting and talking to my family, I've officially committed to Boise State,\" said Niumatalolo, via his Twitter account, @Aliiniumatalolo, shortly before 10 p.m. Tuesday. \nNiumatalolo had drawn interest from several other Division I programs, but ultimately decided on the Broncos late Tuesday night. Boise State made their official offer in June. He was also interested in Brigham Young, Utah and Connecticut. \n\"I wanted to commit to them ever since I got the offer, but I wanted to make sure it was the right fit,\" Niumatalolo said. \"I really like it there.\" \nNiumatalolo was a first-team All County selection a year ago with 108 tackles, including 12½ for losses, four sacks and two interceptions. Through seven games this year, he already has 17½ tackles for losses, four sacks, two interceptions and a caused fumble. He's also been involved on offense, catching five passes for 118 yards (23.6 yards/catch) and scoring a pair of touchdowns. \nFREDERICK -- The Maryland High School Football State Poll, in its 26th year, is based on a statewide voting by sports reporters.
