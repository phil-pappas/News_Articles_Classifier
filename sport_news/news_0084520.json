Coach (Jeff) Soliday (offensive coordinator) did a great job of getting us in the right plays and Brandon stepped up and made some phenomenal throws.\" \nSometimes the Tygers couldn't get out of their own way because of penalties, A special team blunder where the punter took a knee at the 2 reaching for a low snap also played a role in Lex's comeback from 21-0 and 27-7 deficits, setting up the last of Hunter Biddle's three first half touchdowns. \nThat made it 27-21, but the Tygers blunted Lex's momentum as Manns and Swindall hooked up for the third time, covering 77 yards, to make it 33-21 at the break. \nIt was Senior Night, with the home team celebrating during pre-game ceremonies and the Tygers celebrating on the scoreboard as their veteran influence — 18 seniors to just three for Lex — helped them fight off the Minutemen (6-3, 3-3). \nLex was hurt early on a tipped interception by Davis Chapman and takeway by Nishan Rawls on a fumbled kickoff, both of which the Tygers converted into touchdowns, including a shifty 40-yard run by Tyquan Vickers. \nBut moments after he was shaken up on his kickoff return near midfield Biddle scored the first of his four touchdowns. The Tygers would soon discover the Minutemen weren't going anywhere. \nThat became even more apparent when Biddle — who rushed for 202 yards on 18 carries — sped 70 yards for a touchdown on the first play from scrimmage in the second half, cutting the Tygers' lead to single-digits again. \nIt stayed that way until the fourth quarter when Brian Benson, who rushed for 148 yards, tacked on his second two-yard TD run, easing some of his pain from having an 80-yard TD called back by penalty in the first quarter. A fumble recovery by Marvin Parker at the Lex 22 sealed the home team's fate, with Swindall throwing his fourth TD pass — a 3-yarder to Saqaunn Johnson — to make it 45-28. \n\"I'm happy with the way we responded and fought back, but I'm not happy with how sloppy we were,\" Lex coach Taylor Gerhardt said. \"We got banged up and lost four guys and had to shift players around, but I'm proud of our 'next man up' effort. We just can't play sloppy against a good team.\" \nGerhardt admitted that stacking the line on defense was basically pick your poison against a team with skill players like Senior High. \n\"We wanted them to throw because of their running backs,\" he said. \"We certainly did not want them to throw the ball as well as they did.\" \nTIDBITS : Tyger head coach Chioke Bradley is 5-1 against Lexington, 2-1 at Lex ... Lexington's 21 points in the middle two periods were the first allowed by the Tygers in the second and third quarters since their Week 2 loss at Canton McKinley. \nDespite having an 80-yard TD run negated by penalty, Brian Benson went over 1,000 yards rushing for the second straight season and has now scored a touchdown in 13 straight games ... Tyquan Vickers, who had a 40-yard TD run, is closing in on 3,000 career rushing yards. \nLexington head coach Taylor Gerhardt is a Malabar High School graduate and was a member of Stan Jefferson’s coaching staff in the late 1990s and early 2000s as was one of his assistant coaches, Pioneer Career & Technology Center superintendent Greg Nickoli.…Mansfield Senior has won 16 of the last 21 meetings between the Tygers and the Minutemen. \njspencer@nncogannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:57:56.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
