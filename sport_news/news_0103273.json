It doesn’t take an expert to figure out what’s gone wrong. Here is a summation of what went wrong in the seven possessions that didn’t result in a touchdown: \nWeek 1 vs. Carolina (1 for 3): First quarter — Blake Bortles wanted to throw a fade to Marcedes Lewis , but he was covered and Bortles overshot Allen Robinson . Second quarter — Allen Hurns fumbled at the Panthers’ 17. \nWeek 2 vs. Miami (1 for 3): First quarter — on second-and-3 from the Dolphins’ 9-yard line, Rashad Greene ’s catch went for no gain when Hurns missed his block. Bortles overthrew Lewis on third down. Fourth quarter — the Jaguars reached the 10-yard line, and Jason Myers kicked a game-winning 28-yard field goal after Bernard Pierce was stuffed on third-and-1. \nWeek 3 at New England (1 for 2): Second quarter — Bortles missed Corey Grant for a touchdown on first down, and a Lewis catch on third-and-10 was wiped out by an illegal formation penalty. \nWeek 4 at Indianapolis (1 for 3): First quarter — on first-and-goal from the 6, Bortles threw incomplete when Nic Jacobs missed his block; on third down, Bortles threw under pressure when T.J. Yeldon blocked the wrong blitzer. Second quarter — in hurry-up drill, the Jaguars reached the 15, but Bortles threw it away on third down. \nBortles is only 5-of-16 passing in the red zone for 29 yards (four touchdowns), and Yeldon has gained 37 yards on 11 carries. \nOnly when the Jaguars solve their red zone problem will they climb up from their current standing of 31st in scoring (15.5 points per game). \nYELDON, THE PROTECTOR \nThat wrong blitz pick-up aside, Yeldon thrived as a pass protector against Indianapolis, a reason why he played 77-of-81 snaps. \nYeldon stayed in to block on 13 Bortles drop-backs and had an 11-2 record. \n“The good thing about being at Alabama was [learning] pass protection,” Yeldon said. “I’ve always prided myself on that. I don’t want the quarterback to get hit, and I want him to know I’m stepping in there and protecting him at all times.” \nOlson said: “He’s done a great job with that. Where he’s been the biggest pleasant surprise for us is how he’s handled that.” \nBABICH, LOVIE GO BACK \nJaguars defensive coordinator Bob Babich was a career college coach until he joined the St. Louis Rams in 2003 as linebackers coach. The Rams’ defensive coordinator was Lovie Smith , who’s now Tampa Bay’s head coach. \nBabich and Smith first worked together in 1984 at Tulsa, their alma mater. They stayed close through the years, and after a year with the Rams, Smith brought Babich with him to Chicago for his entire nine-year tenure as the Bears’ coach. \nBabich will call the Jaguars’ defensive snaps Sunday, and Smith will handle the Buccaneers’ calls. \n“It was definitely a great break for me — I didn’t know anyone in the NFL,” Babich said of Smith bringing him to the Rams. “[The NFL] was never a part of my plan. The opportunity he gave me is very much appreciated.” \nOVERTIME HISTORY \nFour overtime tidbits from the Jaguars loss to Indianapolis: \n■ The Jaguars fell to 7-8 in overtime and are 0-4 under the new overtime rules. The Jaguars haven’t won an overtime game since October 2009 (23-20 over St. Louis). \n■ Under the old rules (first score wins), the Jaguars were 4-3 in games that featured only one possession. \n■ Jaguars-Colts was the second-longest game in team history (70 minutes, 24 seconds), behind only the Nov. 18, 2012, loss at Houston (72 minutes, 59 seconds). \n■ Myers’ missed 48-yard attempt was the first overtime missed field goal in franchise history. \nTHREE & OUT \n■ Add reserve guard/center Tyler Shatley to the group of Jaguars’ players who have sustained hand injuries this year. Last week in practice, Shatley said his right thumb was, “pulled back really far and from my understanding, a flake of the bone was chipped off.” He will wear a cast for several weeks. \n■ Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston on Greene, his teammate at Florida State: “He’s an amazing receiver. I loved him. He took me under his wing and helped guide me through my whole college process. He’s a great brother of mine.” \n■ The Jaguars are fourth in rush defense, putting them on track for their best finish in that department since 2006 (also fourth).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:46:11.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
