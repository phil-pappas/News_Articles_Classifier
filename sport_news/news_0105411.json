The match referee in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy fined both Aamir and discarded Test batsman Faisal Iqbal for clashing on the field during the match between PIA and Sui Southern Gas. “Apparently Aamir was sledging Faisal and some other PIA players during the match. After a while, things got out of hand and the latter reminded him of his deeds and called him a ‘chor’ (thief),” a source said. He said that Aamir retorted by advising Faisal to stop relying on his uncle (Javed Miandad) and to play cricket on his own merit. The 22-year old pacer has been in top form for his department, Sui Southern Gas, as he bowled them into the main rounds of the tournament with 33 wickets in four matches. Aamir and his teammates Salman Butt and Muhammad Asif were banned for spot-fixing inEngland in 2010. —PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:47:42.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
