Stade, a junior, had 16 saves in a 0-0 tie on Friday night in Norman, Oklahoma. The No. 3 Mountaineers (11-1-1, 2-0-1) entered the game on their win streak, during which they had outscored opponents 27-1, not allowing a goal before TCU managed to score on Oct. 2 in Morgantown in a 2-1 WVU victory. Despite the Mountaineers edging out Oklahoma (8-4-2, 1-0-2) in every statistical category, they faced the same problem they have in the past several games: being unable to finish on scoring chances. West Virginia outshot the Sooners 33-7 and also had a 15-0 advantage in corner kicks, but was not able to get through the tough, Sooner defensive attack. The WVU defense was in its usual form, allowing only three shots on net and posting its 10 th shutout of the season. This was the fifth consecutive Big 12 road match where West Virginia posted a shutout, dating back nearly two years to Oct. 27, 2013 at Texas Tech. Sophomore Michaela Abam led the team with eight shots, with only one being on goal, two others followed with three shots each. It seemed as though the Mountaineers would gather a go-ahead goal when Amandine Pierre-Louis gathered the ball in the 107 th minute and took a shot directly on net. Stade made her 16 th and final save of the game but lost control of the ball and nearly let it sail over her head into the net for the lead. She was able to gain control and the game concluded in a tie. The Mountaineers left Norman, heading to Texas Tech needing a statement win. They got exactly what they were looking for on Sunday afternoon. Surprisingly enough, the No. 13 Red Raiders, who were the sole ranked opponent remaining on West Virginia’s schedule entering conference play, proved to be the least of a contest of any Big 12 opponent faced thus far. A goal by senior Leah Emaus halfway through the first half put the Mountaineers ahead 1-0, a lead they would carry into the half. Head coach Nikki Izzo-Brown clearly wasn’t happy and sparked a fire in the locker room at halftime. Carla Portilla found Nia Gordon just three minutes into the second half, who fired a shot into the top right corner of the net, putting West Virginia up by two. The goal was freshman Nia Gordon’s fourth of the season, who had one of the fastest starts by a freshman in program history, but had not scored since Sept. 6. Play then became extremely aggressive, with two Red Raiders and West Virginia’s Easther Maya-Kith all receiving yellow cards. As the clock ticked inside the 20 th minute, Texas Tech was awarded a corner kick, and senior Alli Murphy was able to net the Red Raiders’ first goal of the afternoon. Murphy’s goal was the first regular season goal allowed by the West Virginia defense in a Big 12 away game since 2013. It was only the second goal allowed in the Mountaineers’ past 12 games. Just five minutes later, Ashley Lawrence sent a ball upfield, and Texas Tech goalie Lauren Watson couldn’t maintain possession of it. Amandine Pierre-Louis found the rebound with an empty net in front of her. While Pierre-Louis wasn’t able to sink the game-winner at Oklahoma on Friday night, she was this time, and put West Virginia ahead 3-1 with just 15 minutes remaining. The Mountaineers weren’t finished, with Nia Gordon making a cross to Michaela Abam, who headed it in for her ninth goal of the season, tying her for 21 st in the country. The assist was the first of Nia Gordon’s career. The 4-1 score would stand until the final minute, extending the Mountaineers’ unbeaten streak to 12 games. Four games remain on West Virginia’s regular season slate, with home matches on Oct. 16 against Kansas and Oct. 18 vs. Iowa State. The Mountaineers will then conclude the season on the road against Oklahoma State and Baylor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:55:51.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
