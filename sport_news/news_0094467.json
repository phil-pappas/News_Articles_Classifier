The agency will prepare the plan by November end for the second round of the competition. “The agency was selected through technical and financial bids. During the course of preparation of the plan, the agency will hold discussions with stakeholders, construction agencies, town planers and citizens,” said DS Garbyal, Secretary, Department of Urban Planning. As part of assistance for the smart city project, the Centre will provide Rs 2 crore to prepare the plan. For the second stage of the selection procedure, cities will be judged on the basis of the city vision and strategy, cost effectiveness, credibility of implementation and innovation. Mussoorie Dehradun Development Authority (MDDA) chairman Meenakshi Sundaram has been appointed as the nodal officer for the smart city project by the state government. The MDDA will play a major role in the project due to the financial resources and expertise it possesses in comparison to the Municipal Corporation. “No doubt, the Central Government will provide funds for the smart city project, the state government has to chip in with a generous contribution from the selected city municipal corporation. The entire process of contribution will increase accountability and reduce the burden from the state,” Garbyal said. Even under the Centre’s Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), that envisages improving water and drainage system in cities, the emphasis was on sharing of finances. “We have submitted a proposal for six cities that will benefit from the scheme. While the Centre will provide financial assistance, local bodies of the selected cities too have to contribute at least 30 per cent of the share in the funds,” added Garbyal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:38:00.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
