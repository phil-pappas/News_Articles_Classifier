Minutes later she was shot and killed in an apparent case of road rage.\nFour-year-old Lilly Garcia was shot and killed during a road rage incident on Interstate 40 on Tuesday. (Courtesy of Patty Romero)\n“She had a beautiful smile, big brown eyes,” Lilly’s mother, Veronica Garcia, said. “She loved Rainbow Dash, Power Rangers, Minnie Mouse.”\nThe shooting touched not only Albuquerque, but the state and nation. National news outlets covered the story and the massive manhunt for the shooter.\n“It really tears at you when an innocent child is harmed or loses her life,” said Mayor Richard Berry. “The community can pray and keep the family in their thoughts and prayers. We need to send a strong message that we’re not putting up with this.”\nPolice Chief Gorden Eden said during a Wednesday afternoon news conference that Lilly’s father told officers he had heard several shots, looked into the backseat where Lilly and her brother were sitting and saw she was bleeding.\n“He pulled over to the edge of the road and tried to administer first aid,” Eden said.\nA 911 call described a man outside his truck in the median cradling an unresponsive child.\nEden said several drivers passing by stopped to help.\n“Two of those people who did stop were nurses and they were able to help render care to little Lilly,” Eden said.\nLilly was taken to the University of New Mexico Hospital, where she died, Eden said.\nLilly’s smile and big brown eyes are apparent in photos shared widely on social media in a massive community outpouring.\nFriends, family members and strangers asked for prayers for the family and donations to fund her funeral, and thousands of commenters on news stories and social media posts offered condolences to the family devastated by the 4-year-old’s death.\nVeronica Garcia’s mother said relatives flew in from around the country to be with the family at their Northwest Albuquerque home.\n“We have a house full of people,” said Maria Cruz. “People that my daughter works with, people that my son-in-law works with, everyone’s here.”\nCruz said Lilly’s brother seems really sad but she’s not sure if he knows exactly what’s going on.\n“My daughter is a mess,” she said. “We just have to be here for her. We have to be strong.”\nA cousin set up a GoFundMe account early Wednesday morning. It exceeded its $10,000 goal within hours. It had generated more than $55,000 by late Wednesday evening.\nGarcia posted a message on the account’s page asking friends, family and the public to share the description of the suspect and send any information to the Albuquerque Police Department.\nEden said the department received dozens of credible and valuable tips from the community. One led to the arrest of Tony Torrez, 31, later Wednesday.\nBerry, Gov. Susana Martinez, and several local businesses were among those offering their support to the Garcias throughout the day.\n“It is so senseless,” Martinez said. “I just can’t express how sad it is to know that something as simple as going down the freeway, and your child dies because of road rage.”\nBerry announced a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the gunman, and the City Council matched it. The FBI offered $5,000 and Crime Stoppers offered $1,000.\nDaniels Family Funeral Services reached out to the family to offer a free burial for Lilly, Eden said.\nChick-fil-A at Cottonwood Corners advertised a Oct. 28 fundraiser in which 15 percent of the proceeds will be donated to the Garcia family.\nEden said while Lilly’s death has had a huge effect on the town, the biggest impact is personal.\n“I cannot imagine being the father of little Lilly,” Eden said. “To have your child in your hands under such circumstances is going to live with that father for the rest of his life.”\nDigital editor Robert Browman and staff writer Nicole Perez contributed to this report.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/a01_jd_22oct_lilly-e1445492307112-283x400.jpg", "https://www.gofundme.com/yq6ud6b4"], "published": "2015-10-22T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:16:48.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
