The Tigers handed the Spartans their first loss of the season, 56-14. ( David R. Jennings / Staff Photographer ) \nBROOMFIELD â€” All it takes is 42 seconds for Holy Family's football team to recapture momentum in its favor. \nThe Tigers wasted no time in rallying back from their quarterback Chris Helbig's late first-half interception that gave Berthoud the ball on Holy Family's 10-yard line. \nBHS safety Max Bump's pick led to a Cody Braesch 2-yard rumble into the end zone for the Spartans, which appeared to be a momentum swing narrowing their first-half deficit to just one score, 20-14, with 42 seconds to go before halftime. \nBut the Spartans failed to make the necessary stop to hold onto that momentum heading into the locker room. \nInstead, they went into halftime drained, as a 45-yard Helbig pass to senior receiver Bryce Buderus brought Holy Family close enough to send a 19 yard pass to Buderus in the end zone as time expired in the half, pushing the Tigers' lead to 28-14. \nThe swing helped lead to a 56-14 Spartans loss in Northern League play, their first of the season (5-1). \nBerthoud failed to rally back in its start to the third, and that was its downfall. Braesch threw his second pick of the night to Joe Golter on the Spartans' second play from scrimmage in the start to the half. On Holy Family's next play, it scored another 19-yard rushing touchdown on the legs of junior Michael Zeman, making the score 35-14 with 11:01 to go in the third. Advertisement \n\"We thought we had a lot of momentum going into halftime, and even giving up that one late in the (first) half we still felt pretty good because we were moving the ball on them,\" Berthoud coach Troy Diffendaffer said. \"But we come out in the second half and don't execute on our first drive. All the sudden it's bang-bang-bang. It took the air out of our sails.\" \nHelbig snatched the spotlight right back just a few minutes later with a 61-yard touchdown pass, again to Buderus, to essentially put it out of reach, 42-14, with 7:34 to go in the third. \nBerthoud's secondary struggled staying with Tigers receivers on deep routes as Holy Family's offensive line hardly allowed Helbig to be touched, let alone sacked or rushed. In other words, Chris Helbig had all day on just about every drop back Friday night, allowing for several receptions over 40 yards. \nBut some of that was by design, Diffendaffer said. \n\"That was our plan, we wanted to rush three and drop eight,\" Diffendaffer explained. \"We've seen all the other teams that have been here rush four and blitz them, and the same result happens. We thought we were going to take a chance and run three at him, and play coverage.\" \nHelbig reached 500 passing yards before the fourth quarter arrived. His final line: 24-for-39 for 500 yards, five TDs, an interception and a score on the ground. \n\"That's a high powered offense,\" Diffendaffer said. \nSome fight was still shown by Berthoud after Buderus' long TD-catch, as the Spartans marched down to within Holy Family's 10-yard line. But a Braesch fumble on a quarterback keeper surrendered the Spartans' possession short of the end zone once again. The senior ended the night 8-for-18 for 170 yards, three interceptions and a lost fumble. \nDiffendaffer doesn't want his leader to give up any confidence, though. \n\"He's doing a good job out there,\" he said of Braesch. \"We ask our quarterback to do a lot of different things. We don't want to draw the reigns back on the kid, because if we do that, we limit what we can do offensively.\" \nThough their first loss of the season is certainly a discouraging one, Diffendaffer wants his squad to shake it right off. He still believes his team could win a 3A Northern League title. \n\"What I tell the team is that this game didn't go the way we wanted it to go, but it still doesn't detract from where we want to be,\" Diffendaffer said. \"These guys (Holy Family) still have to play Roosevelt as well, and we can get in that three-way scenario type of stuff. It's a hiccup, but by no means should we throw everything out.\" \nThe Spartans return home to play Mead on Friday at 7 p.m. in an opportunity to restore the direction their season was taking prior to playing Holy Family. Berthoud was tied for first in the 3A Northern League heading into Friday undefeated, but with its first conference loss, surrenders its share of the top spot to Holy Family (5-1, 3-0 Northern League) and Roosevelt (5-1, 3-0 Northern League). \n\"How we respond is the biggest thing we're after right now,\" Diffendaffer said. \"Are we going to come back and dig down and go to work getting ready for Mead? Or will we relish in the fact that we ran into a bus and they went bang-bang on us?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:57:31.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
