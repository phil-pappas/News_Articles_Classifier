A Traffic Department official said the highway connecting the Valley with Jammu division had been closed for heavy vehicles following shooting stones triggered by rain at Magarkoot in Ramban district. The highway connecting Kashmir with the remote Ladakh region and an alternate road, Mughal Road, connecting the Valley with Jammu division, have also been shut due to the continuous downpour, the official said. With the closure of the three critical roads, one of which is a crucial route for sending supplies to the Valley, Kashmir’s surface link with the rest of the country has been shut. Kashmir is passing through a first major wet spell, expected to last two more days. The wet weather has sounded a winter alarm in the region as residents are facing biting cold due to a considerable drop in the day temperature. Rain was recorded in all major towns of the region, including Srinagar city, where the downpour is continuing intermittently since Saturday afternoon. Srinagar had on Saturday recorded a maximum day temperature of 13°C, which was eight degrees below Friday’s maximum temperature 21.1°C. On Sunday, the city recorded a maximum of 8.8°C, which was a departure of 12°C from the normal temperature. The coldest day, however, was recorded at Gulmarg, which received snow for the second day today. The maximum temperature at Gulmarg was 0.6°C and the overnight temperature dropped to -3°C. The state Weather Department has warned of moderate to heavy rain across Jammu and Kashmir and snow over mountains till Tuesday forenoon. Rain and snow may trigger landslides and cause disruption of surface and air traffic, the department has said. The downpour is being caused by a stormy western disturbance weather system and the rain is expected to continue with increased intensity till Monday evening.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:12:45.098+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
