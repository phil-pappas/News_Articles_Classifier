A big, strong player for a younger guy, first year in the league, a very good skater and we have to make sure that when he's on the ice we're aware of him because he's a guy that he doesn't need a lot of opportunities, but he gets opportunities because of how good he is. So, we need to make sure that whoever is out there against him we know he's on and we've got to play real solid against him.\"\nDevils goaltender Cory Schneider, who will start his fifth consecutive game, is looking forward to facing Eichel. Being from the Boston area himself, Schneider already knows quite a bit about Eichel, a North Chelmsford, Mass., native who played last season at Boston University.\n\"He's a Boston kid, so I heard a lot about him in college, but I actually haven't seen him play live or even that much on TV,\" Schneider said. \"It sounds like he's meeting the hype and that he's the real deal, so I think we're going to have to account for him, which you don't have to do for many 18-year-olds in this league.\"\nDevils defenseman John Moore was a teammate of Eichel on the U.S. squad that won the bronze medal in the IIHF World Championships in the Czech Republic in May and saw a young man who handled himself more like an NHL veteran. (He'll turn 19 on Wednesday.)\n\"It was really impressive,\" Moore said. \"What's obvious are the hockey and the explosiveness and his skating, but it's really refreshing to see what type of person he is, too. He hasn't let anything get to his head. He's really mature beyond his years and definitely has a great future ahead of him.\"\nBRIEFS: C Stephen Gionta was fined $2.284.85 for spearing Senators defenseman Mark Borowiecki in the groin in the second period of Thursday night's 5-4 shootout win in Ottawa. … According to Elias Sports Bureau, Thursday's game was the first in which the Devils overcame a two-goal deficit in the final six minutes of regulation to win since a 4-3 victory over Toronto on Feb. 5, 2010. The Devils scored three times in the final 3:04 to win that game in regulation.\nEmail: gulitti@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:02:49.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
