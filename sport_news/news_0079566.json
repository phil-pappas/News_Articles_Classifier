But if there's some stipulations behind it or some penalties, some big-time penalties or rules or regulations about carrying firearms, legal or illegal, people will second-guess themselves.\"\nJames had taken to Twitter on Thursday in the wake of the fatal shooting of a five-month-old child in Cleveland.\n\"Like seriously man!!!! A baby shot in the chest in Cleveland. It's been out of control but it's really OOC,\" James wrote.\nIn a later post on Thursday after news of the Oregon shootings broke, Quote: : \"C'mon man let's do and be better! Don't fall into the trap. This can't be only way ... #TheLand #TheNation.\"\nJames said Friday the violence in Cleveland and across America was too much to take.\n\"It's happened a little bit too much recently. In the last four weeks four kids under the age of five or six have been killed or very badly injured (in Cleveland).\n\"There's no room for that. There's no room for guns. It's not just in Cleveland it's the whole nation that goes from it. We all hurt from it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:22:43.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
