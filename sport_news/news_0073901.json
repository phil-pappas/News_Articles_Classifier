The Wolf Pack will also play four teams that advantage to NCAA Regionals last season. “We are really looking forward to the opportunity that our 2016 schedule presents to our program,” said Bruce. “The non-conference schedule will undoubtedly prepare us for Mountain West conference play.” Nevada will begin a new era of Wolf Pack baseball on Feb. 19 with a season-opening double header, marking the first game at Nevada for Bruce, who spent the previous five seasons as an assistant at UCLA. The Pack opens the season with a four-game series against Northwestern of the Big Ten on Feb. 19-21 at Sloan Park in Mesa, Ariz.

The Pack will play 10 three-game conference series this season with two series against New Mexico, Air Force, San Diego State and UNLV. Nevada will play just one conference series against Fresno State and San José State. The Wolf Pack’s home opener is set for Tuesday, March 1 as Nevada hosts Santa Clara at 3 p.m. PT at Peccole Park.
