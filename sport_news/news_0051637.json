In addition to Red Bull and their junior team Toro Rosso, Sauber are already on Ferrari's roster, and they will also supply power units to newly-formed American outfit Haas in 2016. \nBut asked whether there will be 22 cars on the grid next season - with the imminent arrival of Haas - Ecclestone replied: \"Yes, for sure. \nThe 84-year-old, mobbed in the Sochi paddock ahead of Sunday's Russian Grand Prix, added: \"Everything's been sorted out so I wouldn't worry about it.\" \nRed Bull's outspoken owner Dietrich Mateschitz has set a deadline of the end of October to decide whether his team, which is based out of Milton Keynes, will continue to operate beyond this season. \nAt the last race in Japan, Red Bull team principal Christian Horner claimed Mateschitz has grown disillusioned with Formula One. \nBut speaking about the Red Bull owner, Ecclestone added: \"He's never fallen out of love. He just wants to be in a position where he can be competitive. And that's what will happen. He'll be okay.\" \nThe future of Formula One itself is also up in the air with Ecclestone claiming earlier this week that the sport could have new owners by the end of the year. \nA report in the Financial Times on Friday claimed that CVC, the private equity group which owns Formula One, is closing in on a deal to sell its 35.5 per cent stake in the sport to a US-Qatari consortium headed by billionaire Stephen Ross. \nEcclestone added: \"I don't think they want to sell but they may sell. Companies like CVC, their whole business is buying and selling companies. That's what they do. \n\"If people have been talking to them for the last few months, last few years actually, now there's people that are pushing, pushing, pushing to buy and it's a case of whether they want to sell.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:51:43.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
