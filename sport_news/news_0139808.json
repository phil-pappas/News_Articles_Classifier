Murray didn't attempt a pass, using his speed on the ground instead, for five carries for 27 yards. Coach Kevin Sumlin said that the package for Murray will expand as the freshman continues to develop.\nA&M turned to Murray to get ground yards because of its lack of depth at running back. The Aggies are predominantly down to only starter Tra Carson with James White out with an undisclosed injury.\nWhere's Speedy?\nSophomore receiver Speedy Noil didn't play against Arkansas due to an undisclosed injury. His status for Mississippi State is unknown.\nNoil, preseason first-team all-SEC as a return specialist, has six catches for 68 yards and one touchdown in limited action. A&M coaches emphasized that he would be getting more involved in SEC play.\nFollow Kate Hairopoulos on Twitter at @khairopoulos .\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/khairopoulos", "https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos"], "published": "2015-09-30T05:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:31:21.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
