Red Lion football players are greeted by students who swarmed the field after Friday's YAIAA football game at Red Lion High School. The Lions had their way Friday, winning 42-7 over Central York. (Chris Dunn — GameTimePA.com) \nOn Friday night, Red Lion was efficient on both sides of the ball on that crucial down and the home team's proficiency led to a 42-7 victory over Central York. \n\"The idea that we need to keep drives alive and sustain drives and also on defense that you better get off the field,\" Red Lion head coach Jesse Shay said. \"Both offense and defense did a nice job with third downs.\" \nRed Lion (5-3, 3-2 Division I) was nine of 12 on third downs on offense and scored two touchdowns — their first and last offensive scores of the contest — on third down. \nDalton Grove scored the Lion's first offensive touchdown of the game on a third-and-1. The senior quarterback ran six yards for the score to put the home team ahead 14-0 in the second quarter. \nBackup quarterback Sam Emig closed the Lions' scoring with a 30-yard touchdown run on a third-and-6 play in the fourth quarter. \nThe defense also was effective getting off the field on third downs and it started early. \nKendrick Boyd-Gillespie picked off Central York quarterback Nik Strine and returned the ball 35 yards for a Red Lion touchdown on the third play of the game. \n\"It's what all teams try to obtain,\" Shay said of the complete team effort. \"You're pleased as a coach when you see that happen.\" Red Lion's Kendrick Boyd-Gillespie carries the ball on a punt return against Central York on Friday at Red Lion. Boyd-Gillespie scored a touchdown in the contest on a 35-yard interception return — the first score of the game — in the Lions' 42-7 victory. (Chris Dunn — GameTimePA.com) \nGrove picked up two rushing touchdowns in the second quarter to push the home team's lead to 21-0 at halftime. His second score came from a yard out with 20 seconds left in the first half. \nShay credited Grove for the team's recent offensive outburst. Last week the Lions scored 61 points in a win over New Oxford. \n\"Our quarterback is doing a fantastic job of running this offense,\" Shay said. \"There's just something. He just runs the offense completely.\" \nGrove accounted for 71 yards on the ground and threw for 73 yards. \nAlex Keough ran for 93 yards on 20 carries for Red Lion. \nCentral (2-6, 1-4) scored with just 28 seconds to play when Cade Pribula found Eddie Santiago for a late touchdown pass.
