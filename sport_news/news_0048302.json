That's especially the case for Coshocton and Ridgewood, as a win Ridgewood will lock up at least a share of the Inter Valley Conference title and a Coshocton loss will hurt the team's playoff and East Central Ohio League Gray Division title chances. \nCoshocton vs. Claymont \nWhen and Where: 7 p.m. Friday at Claymont \nRecords: Coshocton 5-3; Claymont 1-7 \nLast Week: Coshocton was defeated by Dover 35-21; Claymont was defeated by Meadowbrook 42-12 \nOn Senior Night, the Redskins couldn't get the job done against the explosive Tornadoes in a back-and-forth game. Things started well for Coshocton with a 73-yard touchdown connection between quarterback Andrew Mason and Zach Michael, but Dover fought right back. \nDover was able to pull away in the fourth quarter with two touchdowns, as Coshocton didn't have the energy to make a comeback. \nThat loss ended the Redskins' five-game winning streak, but they still sit in a good position to make the postseason and win the East Central Ohio League Grey Division. \nCoach's comments: \"If there was one thing we could take away from that loss to make us better, it's that we have to be involved mentally throughout the entire game,\" coach Jim Woodrum said. \"Even though we lost, I think we still got better.\" \n\"Claymont will run the football, spread it out and throw it. Anytime you have a team that can spread it out and throw it a little bit, they can be dangerous. Hopefully, we will be able to get a little pressure on the quarterback,\" he said. \"This group is always pretty loose. They put more pressure on themselves to perform, but they handle pressure pretty well. They’ve been under pressure all year, coming back from the 0-2 start, winning five in a row and then losing last week.\" \nRidgewood vs. Malvern \nWhen and Where: 7 p.m. Friday at Ridgewood \nRecords: Ridgewood 7-1; Malvern 4-4 \nLast Week: Ridgewood defeated TCC 38-0; Malvern lost to Garaway 49-7 \nWithout starting quarterback Jhett Slusser, the Generals cruised past the Saints, as Kolton Alexander threw for 76 yards and two touchdowns. Trent Harrison led the rushing attack with 101 yards on 13 carries as the Generals ran for 215 as a team. \nThe Generals' secondary was up to the task Saturday afternoon, totaling three interceptions. That win essentially declared them a lock for the playoffs and moved them one step closer to their goal of winning an IVC championship. \nCoach's comments: \"We have the same recipe as always. Come out, be the aggressor and play good defense,\" coach John Slusser said. \"They have a nice quarterback, a lot of skill kids and are well coached.\" \n\"It’s always been our goal to win the IVC. It’s a big deal that we win one of these last two and get that done.\" he said. \nSenior Night thoughts: \"It’s always a special night for those guys playing their last night here. They’ve done a good job of winning football games and making us practice the right way,\" Slusser said. \nRiver View vs. Zanesville \nWhen and Where: 7 p.m. Friday at Zanesville \nRecords: River View 1-7; Zanesville 7-1 \nLast Week: River View was defeated 28-0 by Rosecrans; Zanesville defeated Cambridge 22-12 \nThe Black Bears lost what was thought of as a winnable game to the Bishops last Friday because they couldn't stop Rosecrans' Travis Johnston. Johnston totaled 226 yards and four touchdowns on the ground. \nWith a win, River View would've been playing for a share of the ECOL Grey Division title next week at Coshocton, but that idea is now gone. \nThe Black Bears will now have to turn their minds to one of the better teams in the state — Zanesville. \nCoach's comments: \"Zanesville is a good team. Speed, good running back, they present a lot challenges,\" coach Bob Forgave said. \"They are fast everywhere compared to our guys. They have more speed than we've seen.\" \n\"Kids forget sooner than the coaches do. They have a lot going on,\" Forgave said on kids mentality after last week. \"We will be missing a couple guys, but I think the ones who will be playing are excited to play.\" \n\"Football is about blocking and tackling, and usually the team who does it best wins,\" he said. \ncteaguerob@gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:41:02.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
