I’m embracing it and I feel good about it.”\nIt’s been a learning process because, although Sheard played as both a 4-3 defensive end and 3-4 outside linebacker in Cleveland, there weren’t as many nuances.\nIn Cleveland, his main job was to get to the quarterback and he usually matched up with an offensive tackle. But to have a 6-foot-2, 254-pounder lining up on a guard or dropping back into coverage, while not foreign concepts to Sheard, required a quick study.\n“That’s something you didn’t really get to see him do in Cleveland,” Belichick said. “He pretty much always played one spot, left end, pretty much the same technique most of his career. So seeing him do different things and being able to adapt to them and as you said create depth and versatility for us has been a big plus for him and for us. It’s been good.”\nFor a player like Sheard who loves to watch film and dissect his own performance, the feeling’s mutual.\n“Everywhere you go you’ve got to learn,” he said. “You’ve just got to be able to stay on top of it and staying on top of your plays and it will be easy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:40:33.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
