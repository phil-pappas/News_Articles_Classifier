At every level, adversity from an injury standpoint always seem to creep up at some point in this season. \nThe Iowa Hawkeyes are no different. \nIn a year where the injury bug could ultimately derail the program’s chances at a positive season, the Hawkeyes refuse to let adversity bring them down. It doesn’t define them. \nSenior Drew Ott went down with an elbow injury against Iowa State and then later was lost for the season when he tore his ACL against Illinois. \nNo big deal. Redshirt freshman Parker Hesse is ready to make a name for himself and has. \nBoth starting offensive tackles have been sidelined with injuries. Boone Myers has been out for an extended period of time and Ike Boettger has also missed multiple games. \nIt was already thought to be an inexperienced unit that had a lot to prove. But true freshman James Daniels is a star in the making, and Jordan Walsh is having an all-Big Ten season at guard. \nDaniels started the year as a rotation player at guard but has now been moved to tackle to fill for Boettger. When he’s been the right tackle, Iowa running backs have rushed for more than 200 yards in back-to-back games. \nSpeaking of running backs, the two names that started the season atop the depth chart — LeShun Daniels and Jordan Canzeri — are both now part of the Hawkeyes’ walking wounded club. \nDaniels has been sidelined for most of the year, while Canzeri went down this past weekend with a severe ankle sprain. Canzeri rushed for more than 250 yards in the win over Illinois but he got help Saturday from sophomores Akrum Wadley and Derrick Mitchell. Wadley gained 204 rushing yards and scored four times in the road win over previously-ranked Northwestern. \nIt doesn’t seem to matter who is on the field this season. The Hawkeyes are living behind the “Next Man In” mantra. \nI thought when starting wideout Tevaun Smith went down, the Iowa offense was going to struggle. He’s the most proven guy and the only known deep threat the team has. \nInsert true freshman Jerminic Smith. He had more than 100 yards receiving against Illinois and appears to be ready to move into a significant role if another receiver goes down. \nI don’t know how good this team is. I still believe Kirk Ferentz’s 2002 and 2009 Orange Bowl teams were more talented and better overall. But right now, the 2015 Hawkeyes are 7-0 and have passed every test put in front of them despite a plethora of injuries. \nResiliency may be the word that defines this group when this season ends. Others will look at the schedule as a way to deflate the accomplishments. \nIowa doesn’t control who it plays in Big Ten games. \nIt’s not Iowa’s fault that Michigan, Michigan State and Ohio State don’t appear on the slate this year. \nIowa is one of two teams who have defeated two ranked teams on the road. \nPerennial powerhouse Alabama is the other one. \nIllinois State has not lost since losing to Iowa in the opener. \nPittsburgh is now a ranked team and Iowa gave the Panthers their only defeat. \nWinning at Wisconsin, the Big Ten West Division favorite coming into the season, is never easy although Iowa has done so three times in the last decade or so. \nThe dominant victory over Northwestern was important. The Wildcats started 5-0 and had a ton of momentum before Michigan pasted them the week before Iowa did. \nNow, the same experts who said Northwestern was great before are saying it is isn’t any good now. \nNo matter what Iowa does, it may not get the respect it deserves. If the Hawkeyes somehow complete the regular season without a loss, not even 12-0 will get the Hawkeyes love nationally. \nThey’ll have to win the Big Ten championship game over a team the rest of the country deems worthy — Michigan, Michigan State or Ohio State. \nIn years when Ferentz appears to be losing the fan base, he always seems to roll off a year like this. \nIt doesn’t really matter what the nation thinks though. \nIowa is undefeated through seven games and the clear front runner to win the Big Ten West Division. \nThere is no doubt if that scenario was presented to fans before the season started, everyone would have signed on the dotted line. \nSo don’t worry about who’s not talking about the Hawkeyes. Just enjoy the ride.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:10:27.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
