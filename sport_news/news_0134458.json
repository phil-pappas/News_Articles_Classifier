And they do so much more than most.\nBut success on the scoreboard isn't what inspires this team.\nMore coverage Latest high school sports scores Local high school standings More coverage: New Jersey high school sports More coverage: Southeastern Pa. high school sports That supposedly significant stuff - the fight for victories, the rise in rankings, the pursuit of post-season glory - pales in comparison to the meaning of those bright-orange T-shirts the athletes wear before and after every game.\nThe ones with \"Once You Become Fearless, Life Becomes Limitless\" inscribed on the back.\nThe ones the Crusaders proudly display as symbols of their support for a teammate's little sister, a 10-year-old whose battle with leukemia has neither dulled her spirit nor dimmed her smile.\n\"Whenever I see that smile on her face, I always push through,\" Criscuolo said of Brooke Conklin, the sister of junior midfielder Ashley Conklin.\nBrooke Conklin had plenty of reason to smile on a sunny and warm Wednesday afternoon at Bishop Eustace's stadium off Cooper River Drive.\nShe wore her orange T-shirt, just like her older sister and the other players on the team. She sat at the scorer's table during the game and kept the book, joking with the referees and coaches from Timber Creek.\nShe went through the handshake line after Bishop Eustace's 8-1 victory, and she soon found herself on the shoulders of a bunch of teenage girls who wanted to celebrate her \"good day\" more than a conference victory.\n\"It means everything,\" Brooke's mother, Lisa Conklin, said of the sight of her younger daughter in the warm embrace of her older daughter's teammates.\nLisa Conklin said she and her husband, Ron, along with Ashley and other family and friends, have been \"overwhelmed\" by the support of the Bishop Eustace team and the school community.\n\"You go through something like this and you always wonder, 'Are we ever going to get back to normal?' \" Lisa Conklin said. \"Then you see her out on the field on a nice day, watching Ashley play, surrounded by so much love and support, and it means so much.\"\nBrooke got her diagnosis in the spring. She undergoes chemotherapy treatments about twice a month at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\nBrooke is a fifth grader at St. Mary of the Lakes School in Medford. She's an athlete just like her older sister. She plays field hockey and lacrosse and looks forward to returning to competition.\nBrooke says math is her favorite subject. She is a big fan of the musical group One Direction, listing \"Harry\" as her favorite member of the British boy band.\nBrooke said she doesn't mind her close-cropped hair, since it \"makes it easier to get ready for school in the morning.\"\nAshley Conklin said her younger sister looks to the Bishop Eustace players \"as role models\" whose support has helped her through this trying time.\nSenior understands that the reverse is true as well. The coach knows that Brooke's courage and determination have inspired her team as well as the entire Bishop Eustace school community.\n\"In today's world, we get so hung up on wins and losses,\" Senior said. \"People will ask about your team, and it's always, 'What's your record? Who is your leading goal scorer?'\n\"Really? That's what matters?\n\"This situation has taught these girls what it really means to be a team. It's brought it right down to the bone - 'Are you going to try to make each other better players and better people and are you going to be there for each other on and off the field?' \"\nTeam captains Criscuolo, Maddie Saldutti, and Sarah Keane came up with the idea for the T-shirts, as orange is the color associated with leukemia awareness.\nThe players took the lead in a Light the Night walk for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society on Oct. 17 in Washington Township. They were part of a group of around 150 people who participated in the event on Brooke's behalf, raising around $22,000.\n\"We were hoping for $5,000,\" Senior said. \"It's amazing how this thing has grown, how much support there has been.\"\nBishop Eustace is one of the finest field hockey programs in South Jersey. The Crusaders reached the non-public state finals last season, and are strong contenders to win another South Jersey crown and advance to the state title game again in 2015.\nThese are tough, talented, competitive athletes. They will pursue victory with all their hearts.\nBut their embrace of a sweet little girl with a terrifying illness has turned this season into something much more than a quest for championship hardware.\nThese players and coaches won't lose perspective, even as the games grow in importance. They won't lose sight of what matters, even as every pass and shot seems to gain more meaning.\nThey won't forget that the truly fearless one among them hasn't scored a goal or made a save all season.\n\"We used to play to win or lose like everybody else,\" Criscuolo said. \"We're playing for a reason now. We're playing for Brooke.\"\npanastasia@phillynews.com\n@PhilAnastasia\nwww.philly.com/\njerseysidesports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:46:57.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
