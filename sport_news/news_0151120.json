Myers, Utah State's sophomore quarterback, was supposed to sit out each of the last two seasons. By doing so, he would save one year of eligibility for a time when established star Chuckie Keeton wasn't around. Fate did not allow it. Last year, Myers was doing what most new, raw, undersized quarterbacks do upon arrival at college — working on the practice field and in the weight room, waiting for the day when his opportunity would come. When injuries sidelined those ahead of him, however, Utah Sate coach Matt Wells had no choice. Myers' redshirt was striped away and he stepped in for injured quarterbacks Keeton, Craig Harrison and Darell Garretson. VIDEOS Check out all the Trib TopJobs Myers led Utah State to five wins in six games, including a 21-6 victory over UTEP in the New Mexico Bowl, where he was named MVP. \"I felt like I just had a small role, just time management and doing what I could do, because nobody really knew what I was capable of doing,\" he says now. Despite the success, Myers was again ticketed to redshirt this year. Keeton returned and Oregon transfer Damion Hobbs was eligible, so Wells hoped to save him for 2016 and beyond. Keeton suffered a sprained knee in a 31-17 loss at Washington, however, and Myers' track record as a starter made him the logical replacement last week against Colorado State. Bingo. Myers rushed for 191 yards and one touchdown in a 33-18 win over the Rams. Saturday night, he will once again lead Utah State's offense at Fresno State. \"We played very well, for it being my first start for the season.\" he said. \"There are some mental things we have to work. … But, other than that, the offense got used to me fast and we scored a lot of points. I'm excited to see what we can do next.\" Asked if he was surprised by how quickly Myers re-established himself, Wells smiled and shook his head. \"… We're seeing him every day in the offseason, in spring ball, in the summer and in training camp,\" he said. \"You could see Kent naturally progress, naturally get bigger and naturally get stronger. \"He's continued to mature in this offense. There are ways for him to improve fundamentally each and every week. That's no different than anybody else in the program. But Kent played well.\" Myers is from Rowlett, Texas. Besides Utah State, he visited New Mexico and Air Force while being recruited. At one point, Lobo coach Bob Davie has said he thought Myers would end up in Albuquerque. \"I really liked New Mexico and I really liked him,\" Myers said. \"But I always new Utah State was the place. … I always knew my heart was at Utah State.\" Despite the glut of quarterbacks ahead of him last year and Keeton's continued presence this season, Myers never considered transferring, as Garretson did after last season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:27:13.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
