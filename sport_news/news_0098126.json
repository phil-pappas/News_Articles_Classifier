The Panthers game plan was to run the ball and they succeeded, tallying four rushing touchdowns in the opening half and five overall. \n\"I think we played extremely well today,\" senior running back Dan DiPrenda said. \"The line played exceptionally well, which helped the running backs do well too.\" \nAfter Cedar Grove fumbled away its first possession, the Panthers defense stepped up and forced West Side to commit a turnover. Junior defensive back Joseph Rufo stepped in front of a West Side pass for an interception and ran the ball back to the Roughriders' 15-yard line. \nSenior running back Nick Zirolo carried the ball on the first snap of the drive and weaved through the West Side defense to find the end zone to give Cedar Grove a 7-0 lead. On their following drive, the Panthers increased the lead to 14-0 when DiPrenda ran the ball into the end zone from 16 yards out. \n\"It was a short run and it was really easy for me because our line gave me a gap that was wide open,\" DiPrenda said. \nCedar Grove recorded its second interception of the night when senior Matt McManus stepped in front of a pass for the pick, which gave the Panthers possession of the ball at the West Side 39. Cedar Grove called a passing play and found the end zone for the third time of the night. \nSenior quarterback Nick Zecchino found Rufo near the sideline for a 39-yard touchdown pass. The score increased the Panthers' lead to 20-0 with 3:52 remaining in the opening quarter. Cedar Grove added one more score before the second quarter of play. Senior Dom Ferrara found the end zone on a short-yardage touchdown run to make the score 27-0 heading into the second quarter. \nDiPrenda added his second touchdown of the game when he carried the ball 61 yards for the score midway through the second quarter. A two-point conversion made the score 35-0 in favor of Cedar Grove. \n\"I had a good block on the edge and I was gone from there,\" DiPrenda said. \nHead coach Ed Sadloch was satisfied with the way DiPrenda and company ran the ball against West Side. \n\"Overall, I think we did what we wanted to do and that was to establish a running game,\" he said. \nCedar Grove increased its lead to 42-0 when junior offensive lineman Eric Kriegsman recovered a fumble in the end zone. The Panthers took the big lead into halftime and added to it late in the third quarter when sophomore running back Jake Ferrera ran the ball into the end zone for a touchdown. Armed with a 49-0 lead in the fourth quarter, the Panthers scored their final touchdown when junior Evidence Njoku intercepted a West Side pass and ran it over 40 yards to the end zone. \nSadloch said he is happy with the way his team played, but noted there is room for improvement, specifically ball security. The Panthers surrendered multiple fumbles throughout the course of the game, which is something that Sadloch said needs to be addressed. \n\"I'm a little disappointed we put the ball on the ground a couple of times and lost a couple fumbles,\" he said. \"That's something we need to work on before we play Orange [next week].\" \nIf the Panthers can shore up their fumbling issue, they are confident the can secure another victory next week when they play at Orange Saturday, Oct. 24. \n\"There's always room for improvement,\" DiPrenda said. \"This game was good practice for our next game coming up against Orange, which is going to be tough. I think we can definitely win if we keep playing the way we have been.\" \nThe win boosts Cedar Grove's record to 5-1 and the Panthers have won five straight following their opening day loss. Sadloch said next week's game will help determine just how good this year's squad can be. \n\"This is something that we've been used to in the past,\" Sadloch said of the team's success. \"We had a tough year last year, but I think we're on the right track. We'll know more next week when we play Orange.\" \nEmail: gewelb@northjersey.com Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:03:40.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
