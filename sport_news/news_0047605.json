It's football. It happens. I'm just glad to be back.\"\nStanitzek, who was ejected for targeting, launched himself at Dungey's head after a pass was released. He connected as a Chippewas teammate was bringing Dungey down from behind.\nThe Orange players had mixed opinions as to whether the hit was dirty, while some SU fans were so enraged that they tweeted death threats at Stanitzek.\nDungey was less inclined to talk about the injury that resulted from the play. SU has called it no more than an upper-body injury, per usual, and generally does not report concussions until a player is medically disqualified.\nSU head coach Scott Shafer said after the CMU game that he is vague about injuries to protect his players from being targeted.\n\"We just kind of were taking it as a hit,\" Dungey said when asked if he underwent concussion protocol . \"I was pretty sore the next day, my back kind of contorted weird. Like I said, I'm just happy to be back.\"\nThat last phrase, \"I'm just happy (or glad) to be back,\" was a staple of the six-minute interview, particularly after questions about the play and injury.\nDungey said the hit is part of a lesson he's learning as a college football quarterback: he can't take the same hits that he could in college.\nThe SU coaching staff is advising Dungey to be smarter with his feet, and he's working on balancing that with his competitive edge.\nSaid Dungey: \"I've always tried to get every yard I can, but I really have to change that because these guys are a lot bigger than high schoolers.\"\nContact Stephen Bailey anytime: Email | Twitter | 315-427-2168\nSyracuse football player/coach interviews: 10/13/15 Eric Dungey 'His concussion' During the weekly Syracuse University football player\\coach interviews on Tuesday October 13th 2015, freshman quarterback Eric Dungey talked for the first time about his concussion against Central Michigan.
