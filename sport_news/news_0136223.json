Comment By Craig Gilvarg/Daily News Staff   By Craig Gilvarg/Daily News Staff Posted Oct. 12, 2015 at 9:00 PM Updated at 9:55 PM By Craig Gilvarg/Daily News Staff Posted Oct. 12, 2015 at 9:00 PM Updated at 9:55 PM The opportunity was there, a chance for the Wellesley football team to make a statement. The Raiders have certainly caught the attention of those tracking all things high school football in Massachusetts this season, undefeated and making life miserable for opposing offenses week after week. But Wellesley seemed to lack a signature win, a victory that announced its credibility as a potential Super Bowl contender. A 7-2 defeat of Natick was nice, but the Redhawks, at 2-3, aren’t the same team they’ve been in years past. But triumphing over a team it hadn’t beat since 1999, a Bay State Conference power that seemed to be in the conversation for the league title year in and year out? That would say something. And with a 7-6 win over Walpole on Saturday, the message was heard loud and clear. Wellesley is, indeed, for real. “It was about them playing for each other and them making a statement about how good a football team they want to be,” said Wellesley coach Jesse Davis. With the victory Wellesley improved to 5-0, and the Raiders did it the same way they’ve done it all year — with a relentless defensive effort. One touchdown was all Wellesley needed thanks to a unit that has been nothing short of dominant all season. The Raiders had just one lapse on the afternoon, allowing a 43-yard touchdown run by Salvant Lovevindjy in the third quarter. But a team as stingy as Wellesley makes its opponent fight for every point. The point-after kick proved to be anything but a formality. On the kick, sophomore defensive tackle Gus Saint-Font burst through the Rebels’ line, got his hand up and a finger on the ball, the deflection leaving Walpole a point short. It was the biggest play of the game, and a cherry on top of a career-game for the young defensive tackle who had six tackles — four which went for a loss — and two sacks. “Football clicked for him this week,” said Davis. “It's nice to see a kid have a great week in practice and turn it on in the game. That’s a big part of what we coach — you play how you practice and that clearly was a big factor for him.” Wellesley continued to dominate on the defensive side of the ball through the game’s final quarter. With just over three minutes left in the game, defensive back Griffin Morgan came up with an interception on the Raiders’ 4-yard line to kill another potential scoring opportunity for Walpole. When the Rebels got the ball back with a chance for one more drive, the Wellesley defense rose to the occasion once again, stopping Walpole on fourth-and-3 before running out the clock. Page 2 of 3 - “I thought that we played great defense,” said Davis. “We really have all year. Our defensive coordinator John Griffith, he’s a Walpole guy. He really rallied the kids this week, they fought behind him.” In five games this season, the Raiders’ defense has allowed an average of just 7.4 points per game. Even with an offense that has struggled at times adjusting to the new system Davis installed at the beginning of the season, the Raiders are playing confident. According to their coach, their long losing streak against Walpole hadn’t led to any intimidation come Saturday. “We have some pretty mature football players,” said Davis. “We’re trying to take it one game at a time. They’re tough kids. I don’t think the history of it was a factor in the game at all. They went out there to play a football game. They executed well and we did what we had to do to win.” But in the grand scheme of things? “Obviously there’s a bigger picture for the program,” said Davis. “That’s a big win for us.” High stakes There was plenty on the line when Ashland took on Dover-Sherborn Friday night. D-S was in control of the Tri-Valley League Small. With an unblemished record and just two weeks remaining after the teams squared off, a win likely would have put the Raiders one step closer to securing the league crown. With a 21-7 win, Ashland flipped the script. Now with matching 4-1 records (3-1 TVL), the league title is within the Clockers' reach. Ashland coach Andrew MacKay didn’t want his team thinking about any of this when it took the field Friday. “We just were preaching to the guys one game at a time, one play at a time,” said MacKay. “We run into problems as a unit when we start looking ahead a little bit. We knew we were capable of winning the game. We knew we could run the tempo, play the game at our pace, and we knew if we did that we would have a chance to be successful. \"But we were really trying to not look down the road. In the past when we’ve done that we’ve run into some trouble. But we certainly knew how big a game this was.” Now, if the chips fall the right way, Ashland is in contention for the TVL Small title. First order of business, winning its next two games. Easier said than done. Ashland travels to take on Millis-Hopedale on Friday (7 p.m.). The Mohawks are in the midst of a disappointing season, sitting at 2-3 after heading into the year with high expectations. Page 3 of 3 - But MacKay knows this team’s record is in no way indicative of its capability. Walking out of Millis with a win will be no easy task. “If they’re not the best team we’ve seen this year they’re one of them,” said MacKay. “They’ve lost some games to some very good football teams. They are not a typical 2-3 team. They’re not exactly where they want to be, but they’re in a position to make a run. “Defensively we’ll have our hands full, but we think we’re a pretty good team too, and if we can prepare well this week and have some good practices we should be able to give them a game.” Craig Gilvarg can be reached at 508-626-4405 or cgilvarg@wickedlocal.com.
