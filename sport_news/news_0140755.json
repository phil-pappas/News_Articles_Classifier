That concerns me. The lateness of the slide.\n\"I'm looking at it just to see if there's anything we feel should be done,\" he added about whether Utley might be disciplined.\n\"I have to determine if I thought it was 'excessive,' I guess, is the word, on the slide.\"\nMets manager Terry Collins said it was over and done with, but when asked about how his team felt, replied: \"Yeah, they're angry. They're not very happy about it.\"\nUtley, a veteran second baseman who joined the Dodgers in midseason from the Philadelphia Phillies, said he was just playing hard.\n\"Anytime you have an opportunity to break up a double play, you should do your best to do that,\" he said.\n\"I feel terrible that he was injured. I had no intent to hurt him whatsoever,\" added Utley, who did not remain on the diamond to see if Tejada, who laid on the ground, was all right.\nMets captain David Wright said: \"I have a problem with the play on a number of different levels.\n\"He's running to second base with Ruben's back turned. I don't know what his intent is.\"\nOther current and former major league players weighed in via Twitter.\n\"It bothered me to see Utley's slide and the way he went after Tejada. Being a 2nd base man he needed to think how to break the DP not his leg,\" said Hall of Fame pitcher Pedro Martinez.\nShane Victorino, Utley's former Phillies teammate, said: \"Always called him one of my toughest teammates...Utley showing why I always called him a winner!!!\"\nWashington Nationals shortstop Ian Desmond said: \"Clean or dirty doesn't matter at this point. Dodgers not giving the runs back. Chase will gladly take repercussions.\"\n(Editing by Andrew Both)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:14:50.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
