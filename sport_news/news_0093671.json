RISING STAR # 1 bran9413 @ 10/19/15 04:35 PM Dangit Steve I thought it was gonna be about the main patch with rookie scans in it # 2 Gotmadskillzson @ 10/19/15 04:41 PM That was ALL in that big damn near 1.2GB size patch ? What ? # 3 Poppindom @ 10/19/15 05:33 PM Must be more tweaks inside the gameplay. # 4 Walt Frazier @ 10/19/15 06:18 PM Really? It took a week to release that tiny note? Why on earth not releaae notes at the same time the patch came out? That would have taken about a min to type. Seeing as they are at least active...Could they possibly give us some indication if there actually will be a big gameplay patch? I think the LIVE community, as small as it is, at least deserves to know if a big gameplay patch is being worked on. # 5 Playmakers @ 10/19/15 08:39 PM Quote: Originally Posted by Walt Frazier Really?
