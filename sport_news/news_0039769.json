Beating Angelique and my win over Venus in the semifinals proves I can still play at the top level and, if I work hard, maybe I can win a Grand Slam next year,\" said Jankovic, a wild card entry. \nKerber's serve deserted her midway through the match with four double faults at crucial stages in the second set. Both players traded service breaks twice to go to a tiebreaker where Jankovic held her nerve. \nJankovic continued to rely on her powerful, double-handed backhand and took a 3-0 lead in the third set. After a medical timeout, Kerber tamely folded —dropping her serve again in the sixth game. The 30-year-old Jankovic served out the match. \nThe 27-year-old Kerber will now have to rely on a strong showing at the Kremlin Cup in Moscow, starting Monday, to see if she will remain among the top eight on the Road to Singapore race. \n\"I have entered to play in Moscow but I will have to see how I shape up,\" said Kerber, who said she has been struggling with a back injury. \nThis story has been corrected to show Jankovic defeated Venus Williams in the semifinals, not quarterfinals. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:37:30.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
