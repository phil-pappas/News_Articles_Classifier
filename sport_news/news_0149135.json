Comment Posted Oct. 2, 2015 at 8:50 AM By Guthrie Dingmann Posted Oct. 2, 2015 at 8:50 AM Fall is a great time of year: the weather is cooling, the leaves are changing, and high school fall sports are about to start postseason play, but the best thing about fall is Fantasy Football. The weekly battle of choosing a line up, working the waiver wire to find gems, and talking trades are some of the most fun parts about Fantasy Football. Choosing a lineup is honestly one of the hardest things I do on a weekly basis. My AP Government teacher, Mrs. Thomforde, prides herself on how difficult she makes our “Friday Quizzes,” but I don’t think that those quizzes are anywhere close to the difficulty of choosing a lineup! Do I trust the analysts? Do I go with my gut? Who has the better matchup? Can he replicate his performance from last week? These are just some of the questions a fantasy owner has to ask himself while he sets his lineup. Looking at your lineup from every single angle is critical when trying to choose between San Diego running back Danny Woodhead or Dallas receiver Terrance Williams to start in your flex slot. Every team has it’s own “Julio Jones,”“Rob Gronkowski,” or “Adrian Peterson,” players that must start every week regardless of matchup. The more difficult part is choosing the Woodheads and Williams of the world. Those are the decisions that fantasy owners toss and turn over at 3:00 a.m. Sunday morning. If your team is anything like mine, you suffered heart break a couple Sundays ago when Dallas Cowboy quarterback Tony Romo suffered a broken clavicle. But the great thing about Fantasy Football is that even though my starting QB went down I can pick up a solid option to start from the waiver wire. Now my team is heavily reliant on the dynamic Buffalo Bills QB, Tyrod Taylor, who I was able to pluck up off the waiver wire. Taylor is no Tom Brady or Aaron Rodgers but it shows that that utilizing waivers can make your team better. Every year there seems to be a top talent found on the waiver wire. Last year it was Odell Beckham Jr. Who knows who it will be this year? One thing is for sure, I'll be paying close attention to the free agents in my league. Another really fun aspect of Fantasy Football is all of the trades that go on throughout the year. I know that the league I'm in with my buddies has us talking trades anytime we can. Free time in class, soccer practice, in the lunchroom, anywhere we can find a little down time to talk trades, we do it. Sometimes it probably sounds a little crazy to outsiders, but to us the Fantasy Football players, we take this as seriously as an actual general manager would take his actual team. Page 2 of 2 - This year has already been a very exciting year in Fantasy Football with tons of breakouts from guys nobody was expecting, to injuries to high profile quarterbacks. Here's to another 13 weeks of crazy, wacky, unpredictable Fantasy Football, and remember even if you're not into Fantasy Football, never tell a Fantasy Football player that fantasy doesn't matter.
