McCollum, who started at point guard with Lillard sidelined, found his stride as a score-first lead guard after halftime. He hit 7 of 11 shots in the third, including 3 of 5 three-pointers. McCollum sat out the fourth quarter as Blazers coach Terry Stotts didn't want to run up his minutes after playing 25 minutes through three quarters.\n\"We needed him to score and he had it going,\" Stotts said of his third-year guard. \"He's capable of doing that and he's going to have nights like that for sure.\"\nMcCollum had four assists and no turnovers in his second game getting extended minutes at point guard. But his third quarter outburst overshadowed his steady play distributing the ball and that's fine with McCollum, who knows what he brings to the team.\n\"I'm not here because I'm a great passer. I didn't get to the NBA because I'm a great passer,\" a half-joking McCollum explained following the game. \"I got to continue to develop that and be able to see the floor, but I'm here to score and that's what I'm going to do.\"\nThe Blazers rode McCollum's hot shooting into the fourth and briefly grabbed a five-point lead before Stotts pulled most of his key players and let the end of the rotation close out the game.\nAl-Farouq Aminu finished with 12 points and six rebounds, knocking down two three-pointers and flashing the length and defensive acumen the Blazers hope to see from their starting small forward. At one point during the second quarter he blocked a shot on one end and then ran the break where he finished with a strong one-handed dunk.\nAminu also ran several pick and rolls from the top of the key, a skill the Blazers hope he can sharpen through the season. His playmaking is still a work in progress as he finished with six turnovers and no assists, but he did get to the rim twice attacking off high screens.\nBlazers rookie wing Pat Connaughton grabbed a team-high 11 rebounds to go with six points and three assists. Coming off a 25-point breakout game against the Warriors on Thursday, Allen Crabbe scored 13 points and continued to show confidence in his jump shot.\nPoint guard Darren Collison led the Kings with 18 points and big man DeMarcus Cousins had 16 points and seven rebounds. Kings small forward Rudy Gay was a healthy scratch from the lineup.\nThe Blazers had a chance in the closing minute to steal the win, but Phil Pressey missed a rushed layup and Omari Johnson missed a three just before the buzzer. The win gives the Kings two preseason victories over the Blazers in the last six days after Sacramento won in Portland on Monday.\nLillard sits out\nLillard dressed and went through his warmup routine before sitting out the Blazers' third exhibition game to rest his sprained left ankle.\nLillard first injured his ankle against the Kings when the two teams played on Monday night in Portland and then re-aggravated it in the third quarter of Thursday's win over the Golden State Warriors. Crabbe moved into the starting lineup and McCollum shifted from shooting guard to point without Lillard in the lineup. Lillard did not have a wrap or brace on the ankle and said he would consider playing Monday when the Blazers face Utah.\nHarkless still going through protocol\nSmall forward Moe Harkless traveled with the team to Sacramento, but missed his second straight game as he continues to recover from a concussion he suffered at practice on Wednesday. He has to pass NBA-mandated concussion protocol before he can be cleared to play and seems to be progressing through the steps.\nHe was seen riding a stationary bike following the morning shootaround and he also went through a non-contact workout prior to the game.\nFoul play\nThe Blazers were called for 30 fouls compared to 16 for the Kings. Crabbe fouled out, while Aminu and Connaughton each had five. Noah Vonleh and Pressey had four fouls apiece.\nMcCollum offered an explanation on the whistle disparity: \"We're a young team so refs aren't really familiar with a lot of our guys,\" he said.\nNext up\nThe Blazers play the Utah Jazz in Salt Lake City on Monday for their fourth exhibition game of the preseason.\n-- Mike Richman\nmrichman@oregonian.com\n@ mikegrich", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mikegrich/"], "published": "2015-10-11T06:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:22:19.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
