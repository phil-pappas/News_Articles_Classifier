The 2001 Yankees also did it against Oakland, and the 2012 Giants did it against Cincinnati. Both of those teams went on to reach the World Series. \n“The odds were against us but I don’t think these guys ever thought we were out of it,” Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. \nToronto, who led the majors in homers this season, will play the winner of Game 5 between Houston and Kansas City later Wednesday. Game 1 of the ALCS is Friday night. \n“It doesn’t really matter, we’re just happy we’re going to the next round,” Blue Jays slugger Josh Donaldson said. “Whoever we play is a very, very good opponent.” \nBautista’s homer capped an event-filled, 53-minute seventh inning that took a turn when Toronto catcher Russell Martin’s seemingly routine throw back to the pitcher deflected off batter Shin-Soo Choo and allowed the tiebreaking to score. \n“That was crazy,” Blue Jays starter Marcus Stroman said. “With all that happened, we did a good job of keeping our emotions in check.” \nThe Blue Jays filed a protest after an umpire review ruled Rougned Odor was allowed to cross home plate. Toronto fans pelted the field with debris during the 18-minute delay. \nThe Rangers started the bottom half by making errors on three straight groundballs, and Toronto rallied. Benches cleared twice in the Blue Jays’ half of the inning. \nRoberto Osuna got the final five outs for his first postseason save. \nOsuna turned toward the outfield after striking out Wil Venable, looked to the sky and was mobbed by his teammates as jubilant fans rocked the Rogers Centre. \nAfter Edwin Encarnacion tied it 2-all with a second-deck drive off tough-luck loser Cole Hamels in the sixth, Odor led off the seventh with a single and went to third on a sacrifice and groundout. \nWith Choo up, Martin’s throw back to reliever Aaron Sanchez deflected off Choo and dribbled toward third base. \nHome plate umpire Dale Scott initially ruled it a dead ball but, after Rangers manager Jeff Banister questioned the call, the umpires huddled and Odor was sent home. Martin was given an error. \n“I just caught the ball and threw it back very casually and it hit his bat and then next thing you know run scores,” Martin said. “It’s never happened in my life before. It’s just one of those moments, and it created an opportunity for us to do something special.” Other stories of interest", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:57:29.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
