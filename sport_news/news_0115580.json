Damian Matthew ends a nine-year association with Charlton, having initially joined as the club's youth coach in 2006. \nAthletic tweeted: \"Charlton have terminated the contract of Head Coach Guy Luzon. \n\"The contracts of Assistant Head Coach Damian Matthew and First-Team Coach David Martane have also been terminated. The club would like to thank the trio for their efforts and a further statement will be made in due course.\" \nThe defeat to Brentford was Charlton's seventh in their last nine games, and third in succession. Their last victory was back in August. Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T10:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:56:48.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
