If anybody can rise to the occasion it'll be him.' - Blue Jays manager John Gibbons on Game 5 starter Marcus Stroman \n. \n\"He's done it in the playoffs, he's proven and he's nasty,\" Stroman said. \"I just look forward to competing against Cole Hamels.\" \nHamels was the World Series MVP in 2008, and Stroman will be making his second career post-season start. \n\"There's something different about him,\" manager John Gibbons said. \"If anybody can rise to the occasion it'll be him.\" \nThe pressure is on Stroman after the Blue Jays opted to use ace David Price in relief of R.A. Dickey in Game 4. \nGibbons said Price is \"not here to be abused\" and that he wouldn't count on the star lefty being available for Game 5 at Rogers Centre. \nWithout Price, Aaron Loup would be the only left-hander available out of the bullpen. \nBut Loup's status is unclear after he missed Game 4 with a personal matter. \nGibbons said he did not know if Loup would be available.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:29:02.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
