You need to peak at different times. \n“Everyone has had an opportunity there to rotate through and participate early on and get involved. \n“We have to look at the collective load now, and say realistically we had the Rugby Championship and for the guys who started yesterday, they have really only played two matches in five to six weeks. \n“You have to manage other things later on but right now I don’t feel we have to be looking for rests and stuff like that.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:14:44.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
