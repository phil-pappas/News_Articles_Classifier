Police suspect Ajay was murdered over a love affair and also because he refused to pay the bribe the gang demanded.\nThe arrested men, Sethupathi, Prabhu and Tamilarasan, all from Red Hills, will be remanded in judicial custody on Tuesday, police said.\nAround 11.30am, Ajay came to the fuel station with friends Naren and Sundar to fill his bike when the gang of five arrived on three bikes. Seeing the armed men pounce on Ajay, his friends fled. The others at the outlet, including those waiting to fill petrol, were shocked. Some of them informed police. A team of the Red Hills police arrived and sent the body to the Stanley Medical College and Hospital for autopsy. Police collected CCTV footage from the outlet.\nPreliminary inquiries revealed that the Ajay had been stalking a girl in the area, insisting that she marry him. The girl's brother Dinesh is a close friend of Sethupathi, a murder accused and one of those arrested on Monday.\nPolice said Dinesh complained to Sethupathi about Ajay, who was released from prison only on October 15 after being arrested in a case of red sanders smuggling. Sethupathi demanded a bribe from Ajay and also asked him to stay away from the girl. As Ajay refused to pay up and continued to follow the girl, the gang killed him, police said.
