As kicks sailed in his direction Saturday, Missouri State sophomore Deion Holliman had a swashbuckling mentality. \n“I’ve been doing punt return my whole life,” Holliman said. “It’s a thing that you have to have a feel for. You have to really love it. It’s second nature to me.\" \nHolliman had the biggest day by a Bears kick returner in 33 years last Saturday, with 182 combined punt and kickoff return yardage. It’s the most by a Missouri State player in the school’s Division I era and included a 58-yard punt return touchdown, the Bears’ longest punt return in 10 years. For a player that coach Dave Steckel calls “quicker than a hiccup,” Holliman is eager to add to his totals on Saturday when the Bears visit Southern Illinois. “I do have individual goals, but I’m more focused on team goals,” Holliman said. “I want to do my part to help the team. It’s all about winning. Hopefully we can get a win this week.” Holliman gives a struggling Bears’ team seeking traction a legitimate play-maker. He’s first in the Missouri Valley Football Conference with 366 yards of kick returns and first in punt-return average of 20.2. The native of Camden, Arkansas, is one of the team’s fastest players, but hesitates to put himself at the top of the list. “Zac Hoover is probably the fastest guy on the team,” Holliman said of the Bears’ junior receiver. “I would rank myself in the top three (with senior running back Ryan Heaston). But I’d say I might be quickest.” To Holliman, there’s a difference in speed and quickness, with the latter all about making defenders miss in the open field while maintaining top speed, dodging tacklers. “I can kind of cut on a dime and stop and go on a dime,” he said. \nSteckel said Holliman’s work ethic has stood out, especially during the special teams period during practice where it’s clear that Holliman takes pride in his craft. Heaston said teammates were as excited as Holliman over his punt-return touchdown. “It’s special to see and that’s coming from the heart,” Heaston said. “Deion is one of the hardest-working players on this team. \nHe comes in every day, whether it’s film, football, the offseason, whatever and he works.” Off the field, Steckel said Holliman’s personality matches his football energy level. “He’s enthusiastic and is so much fun to be around,” Steckel said. “He wants to make things happen, on and off the field. Just a great kid to be around.” Holliman said it’s good to have his first punt-return touchdown out of the way. \n“It took some weight off my shoulders,” he said. “I knew it would come, in due time. But it’s a confidence booster and I’m eager for more.” Bears at Southern Illinois", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:15:14.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
