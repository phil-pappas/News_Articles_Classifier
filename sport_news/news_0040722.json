By Damon Lee Fowler T here is never a time when the aroma of sizzling bacon doesn’t stir appetites, even those of hardened vegetarians. But when that aroma is carried on the crisp air of autumn, well: it’s nothing short of pure magic.\nIt’s the essence of golden sunlight, bracing air, turning leaves and a crackling hardwood fire all at once.\nWhat’s more, there’s not a single flavor of the season from apples to oysters that bacon doesn’t complement. But of them all, nothing evokes the season quite like the marriage of bacon with butternut squash, especially when shallots and sage are added to the equation.\nWhen that little quartet is brought together in the pot, whether it’s for a soup, pasta sauce, savory side dish or cheese-crusted gratin, the results are more warming and comforting than a favorite old sweater.\nCracking the (Butter)nut: Whittling\nthe sweet, dense flesh of a butternut squash down to size can be a challenge, but with a few tricks, the job is done without much trouble.\n• First, choose smaller squash with a fairly narrow neck. These are easier to deal with and I think they taste better.\n• Peel it completely with a vegetable peeler (for this job, a “Y” shaped peeler works best). If the skin is especially thick, you may need to go over it twice to get to the orange inner flesh.\n• Lay it on one side and trim away the stem and blossom ends with a large, sharp knife.\n• Insert the tip of the knife into the point when the neck of the squash just begins to flare into the body. This is the top of the seed cavity, which is much easier to cut through. Go all the way through and then pull it out. Then lay the knife on this cut and slice through, separating the neck and fat, round bottom.\n• Turn the fat round bottom up so that it sits flat on the work surface and cut it in half. Scoop out the seeds and connective tissue with a melon baller or sharp-edged spoon.\n• Slice the neck into thick rounds. You can now cut the squash easily into cubes or slices as needed for your recipe.\nThin Spaghetti with Butternut Squash and Bacon\nServes 4\n4 extra-thick slices applewood smoked bacon, cut into dice\n1 small (1-1/2-pound) butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and diced\n1/3 cup small-diced shallots (about 2 medium)\nSalt and whole black pepper in a mill\n2 tablespoons thinly sliced fresh sage leaves\n2 small scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced\n12 ounces (3/4 pound) thin spaghetti\n1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano\n1 tablespoon very small sage leaves, left whole\n1. Put bacon in a 3-quart deep saute or braising pan and saute over medium heat until browned and fat is rendered. Spoon off all but 2 tablespoons fat. Add squash and toss until hot through and glossy. Add shallot and saute until squash and shallot are beginning to color at edges, about 3-4 minutes.\n2. Add sage and toss until bright green, then add about 1/4 cup water stirring and scraping to loosen cooking residue on pan. Cover, reduce heat to low, and braise until squash is just tender, about 4-5 minutes longer. Check to make sure moisture does not completely evaporate. Uncover, add scallion, and toss until well. Turn off heat.\n3. Meanwhile, bring 4 quarts water to a rolling boil. Stir in small handful of salt and spaghetti. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, using manufacturers suggested cooking time as guide. When ready, reserve 1/4 cup cooking liquid and drain pasta. Don’t over-drain. Add pasta to sauce in pan and toss well. If it seems dry, add a tablespoon or so of pasta cooking water.\n4. Add half of cheese and toss, again adding a little pasta cooking water if too dry. Scatter small whole sage leaves over and serve from pan or turn into serving bowl and sprinkle with whole sage leaves. Serve at once, passing remaining cheese separately.\nButternut Squash Soup with Bacon and Onion Confit\nYou can serve this soup with only the scallion garnish, or with crumbled bacon and thinly sliced sage leaves, but the bacon and onion confit sends it right over the top.\nServes 6\n1 large butternut squash (about 2-to-2-1/2 pounds)\n2 medium shallots, peeled and thinly sliced\n1 medium leek, trimmed, split lengthwise, cleaned, and thinly sliced (both white and tender green parts)\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter\n3 cups chicken broth\n1 bouquet garni made with 1 large sprig each flat leaf parsley, sage, and thyme\nSalt and whole white pepper in a mill\n2 cups whole milk\nBacon and Onion Confit (recipe follows)\n2 tablespoons thinly sliced green scallion tops\n1. Peel squash and cut off long neck where it begins to flare. Split fatter section in half and remove and discard seeds. Cut into 1-inch chunks. You should have about 5 cups.\n2. Put shallot, leek, and butter into heavy-bottomed 3-4-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute, tossing often, until translucent, about 4 minutes. Add squash and toss until hot through, about 1 minute. Add broth and bouquet garni and season with salt and white pepper. Bring to boil, loosely cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer until squash is tender, about 10-15 minutes. Turn off heat. Remove and discard bouquet garni. Puree in batches in blender or food processor. Soup can be made several hours or day ahead to this point. Cool, cover, and refrigerate.\n3. When ready to serve, return soup to pot, bring to simmer over medium heat, and stir in milk. Bring back to simmer, taste and adjust salt and pepper, and simmer 3-5 minutes longer. Ladle soup into warmed soup bowls and top with spoonful of bacon confit. Sprinkle scallion greens over each and serve at once.\nBacon and Onion Confit\nThis is a lazy day at home kind of recipe, because the simmer must be slow and prolonged, and can’t be left completely unattended, but luckily, it can be made entirely ahead and will keep for up to six weeks in the refrigerator.\nMakes about 1 cup\n1 pound thick cut applewood- or hickory-smoked bacon, cut crosswise into 1/2-inch strips\n1 large yellow onion, trimmed, split lengthwise, peeled, and diced small\n1 tablespoon (4-5 cloves) minced garlic\n1 tablespoon roughly chopped fresh (or 1 teaspoon crumbled dried) rosemary\nAbout 1/4 teaspoon crushed hot red pepper flakes, or to taste\n1/4 cup (firmly packed) light brown sugar\n1/4 cup red wine or cider vinegar\n3/4 cup medium dry sherry, port, or dry Marsala\n1. Put half of bacon in a 3-4 quart heavy-bottomed enameled iron pot over medium heat. Cook, stirring often, until lightly browned but not yet crisp. Remove with slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Add and brown remaining bacon, then remove it to paper towel as well. Spoon off all but 2 tablespoons fat.\n2. Add onion and saute until translucent. Add garlic, hot pepper, and rosemary, and cook until fragrant, about a minute longer. Add the sugar, stirring until it dissolves.\n3. Return bacon to pan and stir in vinegar and 1/4 cup of sherry. Bring to simmer, and reduce heat to barest possible simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes or until liquid is evaporated. Add 1/4 cup more sherry and continue simmering 20 minutes longer.\n4. Add remaining sherry and simmer until onions are meltingly tender and confit is very thick and a rich mahogany color, at least 2 more hours, adding a few spoonfuls water as needed when it gets too dry. Cool and transfer to a clean canning jar. Store well covered in refrigerator for up to 6 weeks. Best served warm: reheat over low heat in a heavy-bottomed, preferably enameled iron, saucepan.\nBraised Butternut Squash with Bacon and Shallots\nServes 4\n1 large (about 2-2-1/2 pounds) butternut squash\n4 slices extra-thick cut applewood bacon, cut into large dice\n1 cup sliced shallot or yellow onion (about 3-4 shallots or 1 medium onion)\n1 clove garlic, crushed, peeled and minced\n8–10 fresh sage leaves, thinly sliced\nSalt and whole black pepper in a mill\n1/2 cup chicken broth or water\n1 tablespoon each chopped fresh sage and flat leaf parsley\n1. Peel squash. Cut off long neck where it begins to flare. Split squash in half, remove and discard seeds, and cut into 1-inch chunks.\n2. Put bacon in large, lidded skillet (preferably cast iron), braising pan, or heavy sauté pan that will hold squash in single layer over medium heat. Cook until browned and fat is rendered. Spoon off all but 3 tablespoons fat and add onion. Saute until onion is just beginning to color, about 5 minutes. Add squash and raise heat. Toss until glossy and hot, about 1 minute, then add garlic, sage, and season with salt and pepper. Toss well and add broth. Bring it to boil, cover, and reduce heat to a bare simmer. Cook until squash is nearly tender, about half an hour.\n3. Remove lid and raise heat to medium high. Reduce liquid, shaking pan and turning squash frequently to prevent sticking, until liquid is evaporated and thick, and squash are just beginning to brown. Turn off heat. Taste and correct seasonings, sprinkle with herbs, and serve at once.\nVariation: Butternut Squash and Bacon Gratin – Use an oven-proof skillet or flame-safe casserole and omit step 3 of Braised Butternut Squash with Bacon and Shallots. When the squash is nearly tender in step 2, turn off heat, uncover, and mix in herbs and 1 cup coarsely grated Gruyere cheese. If you like you can enrich is with a cup of heavy cream. Level top and sprinkle with another 1/2 cup grated Gruyere and 1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. and bake (uncovered) until the cheese topping is golden, about 30 minutes.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14803582.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14803584.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14803584.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14803582.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14803583.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14803583.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:15:17.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
