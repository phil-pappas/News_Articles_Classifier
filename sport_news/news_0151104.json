(AP Photo/LM Otero) By STEPHEN HAWKINS The Associated Press ARLINGTON, Texas â€” \nMike Trout hit a leadoff triple in the ninth inning and scored on Albert Pujols' tiebreaking single, sending the wild card-contending Los Angeles Angels to a 2-1 win over Texas that kept the Rangers from clinching the AL West title Friday night. \nRangers closer Shawn Tolleson (6-4) appeared in his fourth consecutive game. Trout hit the second pitch deep into the right-center gap, then slid headfirst into third base before emphatically pumping his right arm toward his teammates in the dugout. \nPujols followed with a soft single to left field on the next pitch. \nTexas went into Friday already assured a playoff spot, but able to secure the division title with a win over the Angels or a loss by second-place Houston.
