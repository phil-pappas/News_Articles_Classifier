Dickey throws a dud as Blue Jays crushed by Royals in ALCS Game 4", "locations": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "John Gibbons was asked before Game 4 whether he believed momentum played any role in baseball.\nThe implication being that his Blue Jays may hold some advantage, having busted out for 11 runs less than 24 hours earlier to win Game 3.\nGibbons allowed that momentum can sometimes have an effect within a game, but never from one to another. Then he repeated a baseball cliche: “You guys have all heard it before, it really starts on the mound.”\nThe truth of the manager’s words landed with a dull thud before Tuesday’s game was even 15 minutes old. By the time Gibbons was forced to call upon utility infielder Cliff Pennington to make the final out, they rang even truer.\nR.A. Dickey, the Jays’ 40-year-old knuckleballer and Game 4 starter, was clearly not at his best as Kansas City scored their first four batters on a bunt single, home run, walk, stolen base, conventional single, passed ball and a sacrifice fly. It was a mixed bag of misery for Dickey and the Jays, and the Royals kept adding in the second when ex-Jay Alex Rios — who homered twice off Dickey in one game back in 2008 — went deep to make it 5-0.\nThe Jays hung in for a while, scoring a pair to keep it interesting for a few innings before the Royals tacked on nine more runs against the soft underbelly of the Jays’ bullpen, including Pennington.\nBut even that early deficit was too much to overcome, as the Jays lost 14-2 in front of a stunned, sold-out crowd of 49,501.\nThe 14 runs against matched the most ever allowed by the Jays in the post-season, which they eerily allowed on this very day in 1993. That, however, was a wild, 15-14 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies.\nThese Jays, on the other hand, now face the familiar prospect of having to win three straight to keep their season alive, as they did in their division series against the Texas Rangers after falling behind 2-0.\nDickey was yanked before he could make it out of the second inning, in what was his shortest start in more than seven years and only the third time in his 13-year career that he failed to go at least three innings.\nTuesday could also be Dickey’s final start as a Blue Jay — the team has the option to bring him back next season — after a three-year tenure that had a handful of highs, but will ultimately be remembered as a disappointment. The fact the two prospects the Jays traded to get Dickey — Noah Syndergaard and Travis d’Arnaud — are starring for the New York Mets this post-season — and figure to do so only fans the fiery angst.\nFor Jays’ fans who have never been comfortable with the knuckleball — a pitch that its master will admit, can be fickle and unpredictable — Tuesday confirmed their worst fears about the pitch’s untrustworthiness.\nBut based on Dickey’s recent track record, Tuesday’s abbreviated outing was a surprise. He posted a 2.80 ERA in the second half and was one of the best pitchers in the American League since the all-star break. He wobbled a little in his only start against the Rangers in the ALDS, but allowed just one run in 4 2/3 innings. Tuesday was a hell of a time for a dud.\nFor Jays’ fans looking for a silver lining, they will find it in Liam Hendriks, the Australian right-hander, who served admirably in relief of Dickey, throwing 4 1/3 scoreless innings to not only keep the Jays in the game, but also limit the exposure to the rest of the bullpen. What Hendriks did, despite the loss, means the Jays will at least have a chance to come back in this series.\nIt was the first time he had thrown more than three innings out of the bullpen since Sept. 6, 2014, back when he was a member of these same Royals. The last time he threw more than four innings was as a starter in May 2014.\nBut in a decision for which he will be heavily scrutinized, Gibbons lifted Hendriks in favour of LaTroy Hawkins in the seventh inning, giving way to a Royals’ rout. Hawkins, the 42-year-old right-hander who is planning to retire at the end of this, his 21st major-league season, has struggled badly since the beginning of September, appearing to have hit the proverbial wall.\nHawkins and Ryan Tepera allowed the game to drift out of reach before Gibbons, reluctantly, had to go to Mark Lowe, one of his high-leverage relievers, to get through the game.\nMeanwhile, Chris Young, the Royals’ 6-foot-10 veteran right-hander, allayed any concerns about his fly-ball tendencies not playing well at the Rogers Centre by limiting the Jays to just a pair of runs on three hits without giving up a single homer.\nYoung doesn’t throw particularly hard, but given his height, he actually releases the ball closer to the plate than most hitters, so his pitches appear faster than they are. The Jays were obviously fooled, notching just one extra-base hit and faring no better against the Royals’ dominant relief corps.\nSo the Jays once again have their backs against the wall with their season on the line. Time will tell whether they have another comeback in them, but the road through Kansas City will be tougher than Texas.\nMore on thestar.com\nArsenal surprises Bayern Munich to keep Champions campaign alive", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:57:54.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
