I'm sure a lot of people and families are connected to some of the victims,\" Guthrie said. \"We are thinking of them. We are prayful especially those who were directly impacted. Those families are going through an unimaginable loss today.\"\nHe said he violence is never the answer and it's happened too often.\n\"You just hope that at some point in time we as a society and we as a people can learn to cope with struggles and difficulties and challenges in our lives in a different way,\" he said. \"All of us go through struggles. All of us have challenges. Maybe we can show a little more love and compassion to those going through other things. Hopefully the end result is we can stop having to witness these types of tragedies.\"\nHe said he was on a mission trip in Spain when he heard about the mass shooting at Columbine High School in 1999. He said he couldn't comprehend it or understand it. He said now youth are use to hearing about school shootings.\nYou can leave your condolences for the victims on our Facebook page.
