Game: Pebblebrook (2-2, 0-1) at South Cobb (1-3, 0-1), 7:30 p.m.Last year: South Cobb 42, Pebblebrook 21All-time series: South Cobb leads 20-17Prediction: South Cobb 21, Pebblebrook 10Tonight is South Cobb’s homecoming against its neighboring rival and coach Sherrod Rainge even hinted of a surprise that he has for the fans. He also wants to package a victory to go with the surprise so the Eagles can even their record in Region 3 .South Cobb is a polar opposite of last season. Its offense isn’t as explosive as it was a year ago, largely due to graduating players like quarterback Kylil Carter, but its defense has come a long way and is allowing more than 17 fewer points.South Cobb has beaten Pebblebrook seven straight times and hasn’t lost to the Falcons since 2001. The Eagles are aware, however, that the Falcons have shown improvement and growth in numbers under first-year coach Kevin Saunders.“Our senior class hasn’t beaten South Cobb,” Saunders said. “They want to give it everything they got.”While Pebblebrook’s defense is still young, it has had success running the Wing-T offense. The Falcons beat Osborne 51-7 and Alcovy 40-7, both on the road.In Pebblebrook’s 32-7 loss to Westlake last week, Tyreek King-El rushed for 88 yards and a touchdown.“They’ve already shown they can run the ball well,” Rainge said of Pebblebrook. “We don’t see a lot of Wing-T these days. It’s been mostly spread, but their offense in itself will be a challenge.”Knowing South Cobb’s offense has struggled at times, the Eagles are leaning toward establishing a stronger running attack instead of relying so much on the pass. But most important, South Cobb will have to cut down on penalties on both sides of the ball after the Eagles got flagged 12 times for 115 yards last week.“We’ve been in double digits in penalties and it puts us in a hole offensively and defensively,” Rainge said. “We need to be more disciplined, and I know the kids are sick of me talking about this.”Game: Langston Hughes (1-3, 1-0) at Campbell (2-2, 0-1), 7:30 p.m. Last year: Langston Hughes 38, Campbell 7All-time series: Langston Hughes leads 2-1Prediction: Campbell 28, Langston Hughes 21East Coweta may have slowed Campbell’s offense, which had been averaging 40 points per game, last week, but for Campbell quarterback Jawan Nobles, that game won’t affect his play moving forward, nor will it affect the Spartans, who host Langston Hughes tonight at McDaniel Stadium.In his second season as the starter, Nobles, a 6-foot-3, 185-pound senior, has the necessary tools and skills to keep Campbell’s offense humming as the Spartans seek their first Region 3 victory of the season. He’s rushed for more than 100 yards three times this season, including 210 yards in the Spartans’ 50-41 loss to Lakeside-DeKalb three weeks ago. Nobles also has two 100-yard passing games, and can seemingly do it all for the Spartans.“He’s a freak of an athlete,” Campbell coach Ryan Brady said. “That’s pretty much how I would describe Jawan. He has great length and very good speed, and that combination makes him a big threat in our offense.“He has 4.4 speed in the 40, was the county champion in the 200, and he anchors the 4x100 relay team in track and field. Jawan’s really fast and elusive in the open field. Once he gets around the edge in the open field, you can pretty much chalk it up as a touchdown because it’s going to be tough to catch him.”Brady said several schools were recruiting Nobles at quarterback, but he committed to Appalachian State, where he will play wide receiver.“(Appalachian State has) a history of success with changing guys to fit the system,” Brady said. “They’re getting a kid with a very good football IQ. He understands what’s needed and what we need him to do on the football field.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:40:55.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
