One of our goals at the start of the season was to make sure we are playing our best football at the end of the year.\" \nUMD has won 14 straight games at Malosky Stadium and will kick off against Minnesota-Crookston at 1:05 p.m. on Saturday. That game can be seen live in the Northland on the My 9 Sports Network.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:13:50.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
