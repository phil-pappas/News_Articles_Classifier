Signal photo by Dan Watson A A A \nSo-called big games often fall far short of their billing. \nIt’s conceivable that Santa Clarita Christian and Trinity Classical Academy could’ve built up the first-ever “Faith Bowl” with T-shirts and burgers, MVP trophies and raucous Christian music only to have the game itself fall flat. \nThat wasn’t the case. \nThe first 11-man football matchup between the Santa Clarita Valley’s only Christian high schools had all those peripheral things, but it also had a first half fit for a rivalry game — one that saw the perceived underdog Trinity turn three interception returns for touchdowns into an 18-14 halftime lead. \nBut the Knights couldn’t keep down the high-powered SCCS offense forever, and Cards quarterback Tristan Miller bounced back from five first-half interceptions to pick apart Trinity in the second half. \nMiller finished the game 30-for-57 for 326 yards and three touchdowns — he completed his final 11 throws. \n“He could feel the rivalry on campus — in the air, in the community,” SCCS head coach Garrick Moss said of Miller, who leads the East Valley division with 2,085 yards, 29 TDs and 12 interceptions . “... He put more pressure (on himself) than he needed to.” \nTwo of Miller’s scores went to SCCS wide receiver Michael Uribe, who was chosen by The Signal (upon request by the schools) as the Cardinals MVP of the game. \nTrinity’s MVP went to senior Ian Caddow, who returned two interceptions for TDs in the first half. \nThe teams prayed together after the game before individual trophies were given to Uribe and Caddow. \nTrinity is currently playing as an independent, and Knights head coach Les Robinson said after the game he didn’t know whether they’d join SCCS’s San Joaquin League next year. \nBut either way, the Faith Bowl will roll on. \n“We are looking forward to it,” Robinson said. “We know they are.” \nWhite hot \nSlowly ... steadily ... little by little , Hart High graduate and former COC wide receiver Tim White had earned a role on the Arizona State offense. \nThen bam , White went big time on Saturday. \nThe 5-foot-11-inch junior caught seven passes for 144 yards and two touchdowns in a 48-23 Sun Devils win over the University of Colorado in Tempe, Ariz. \nWhite beat the Buffaloes defense on a double move for a 38-yard TD early in the second quarter to put ASU ahead 24-7. \nHis second score was far cooler. \nASU quarterback Mike Bercovici had a pass deflected by a Colorado defensive back only to have White catch it at the Buffaloes’ 27. The COC alumnus then ducked under one tackle attempt and simply ran away from another would-be tackler for a 45-yard score early in the third. \nOne tackler White didn’t get away from — at least on one particular play — was Valencia High graduate and Colorado defensive back Tedric Thompson. \nThompson tackled White after a 4-yard catch midway through the third quarter. \nThe Colorado junior finished with five tackles in the game. \nFor the season, White has 20 catches for 278 yards and five touchdowns. \nCOC football \nLike the catchy Phil Collins tune, you could feel it coming. \nThe Cougars haven’t looked like the team that handily beat the then-No. 1 ranked squad in the state in their season opener since, well, their season opener. \nCollege of the Canyons saw its first 5-0 start since 2008 turn into a 5-1 start on Saturday in a 19-3 non-conference loss at No. 17 Saddleback College. \nCOC, which entered the week ranked No. 4 in the state, had won its previous four games by a combined 20 points. \nBut in each of those games, the Cougars found a way to prevail — whether that be two TDs in the final 4:38 against Pasadena or a Devon Dunn scoring run with less than 5 minutes left against Santa Ana. \nThe Cougars had no such answers Saturday. \nCOC turned the ball over on downs deep in Saddleback territory twice in the fourth quarter — at the Gauchos 23 and 5, respectively. \nThe latter came with less than 4 minutes to play. \nThe Cougars also saw a drive end at the Saddleback 29 in the first half after a Dunn fumble. \nAlec Chadwick provided the only Cougars scoring with a 40-yard field goal in the third quarter. \nDunn completed 21-of-46 passes for 209 yards and no TDs or interceptions. His main target was Conner Byrnes, who caught nine passes for 97 yards. \nCougar Anthony Costleigh posted a team-high 10 tackles. \nTriston Brown recorded an interception for COC, which remains in a tie with Cerritos for first place of the National Division, Northern Conference at 2-0. \nVereen shines for Giants \nThe 49ers should double team Vereen, said the NBC commentator. \nThe comment came about the time the New York Giants began their game-winning drive with three of their best wide receivers sidelined — Odell Beckham Jr., Rueben Randle and Victor Cruz. \nThe commentator was right. \nValencia High graduate and Giants running back Shane Vereen caught three passes for 51 yards on that final 82-yard drive that ended with Eli Manning’s scoring strike to Larry Donnell with 21 seconds left to give New York a 30-27 win. \nVereen finished the game with eight catches for 86 yards and a 2-yard TD catch that put the Giants ahead 10-3 early in the second quarter. \nIt was Vereen’s first score of the season. \nHe also ran the ball five times for 24 yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:00:59.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
