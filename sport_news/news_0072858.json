But while Ohio State remains atop the Amway Coaches Poll , the Buckeyes grip on the No. 1 spot is starting to slip. \nThough Ohio State did eventually get by Indiana in its Big Ten opener on Saturday, there are now 12 ballots that do not have the Buckeyes on top. TCU has four of those first-place nods and checks in at No. 2 this week after a demolition of struggling Texas. Another Big 12 squad, Baylor, now has five No. 1 votes. But the Bears, a big winner against Texas Tech, remain at No. 4 overall, just a single poll point behind No. 3 Michigan State. The Spartans, who had a narrow escape of their own against Purdue, retain one first-place vote and continue to exchange the No. 2 position with TCU. \nLSU moves into the top five this week and can also now claim a first-place vote. The other No. 1 nod went to Utah, though the Utes remain No. 7 overall, a notch behind No. 6 Clemson. Snap judgments from Week 5 in college football \nStock up: Florida. A lot of the major mobility this week in both directions can be traced to some decisive results in the Southeastern Conference. The Gators are the biggest upward movers of the week, climbing 11 positions to No. 12 after blasting Ole Miss. \nStock down: Georgia. The Bulldogs, on the other end of a shellacking at the hands of Alabama, share the dubious honor of the week’s largest drop sliding 10 places to No. 16. \nStock up: Oklahoma. Like Clemson and Utah, the Sooners make a five-place vault to grab a foothold in the top 10 at No. 9 after taking care of previously unbeaten West Virginia. \nStock down: UCLA. The Bruins also take a 10-position hit to No. 20 after falling at home to Arizona State. College football's Week 5 winners and losers \nStock up: Texas A&M. The Aggies kept their record clean by beating Mississippi State and continue to edge upward, checking in this week four places higher at No. 11. \nStock down: Mississippi. The Rebels still have that Alabama win from earlier they can point to, but their most recent outing wasn’t nearly as impressive. Ole Miss plunges eight spots to No. 13 after being dominated by resurgent Florida. \nNew kids on the block: No. 21 Michigan, No. 23 Iowa, No. 24 Boise State, No. 25 Memphis. \nCollege dropouts: Wisconsin, West Virginia, Mississippi State, Oregon. \nGALLERY: AMWAY COACHES POLL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T19:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T01:59:57.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
