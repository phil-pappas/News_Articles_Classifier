He softened — even flipped — his rhetoric on immigration, and like Sen. Marco Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush, both of Florida, he speaks Spanish on the campaign trail.\nThe divide between these two approaches is significant — as are the stakes of the Oct. 28 debate. The winner of this clash of ideas will go a long way toward determining the victor of the GOP primary and, ultimately, the odds that Republicans capture both the swing state of Colorado and the White House in 2016.\nAdvertisement \"It's sort of like a religious test,\" said Stephen Mumme, a politics professor at Colorado State University, of the fervor of the fight over the estimated 11 million immigrants in the U.S. who came illegally. \"These are rather irreconcilable points of view.\"\nTancredo says he was a \"nothing-burger\" congressman before he began his fight last decade against illegal immigration. Like Trump, he gained a political following by combining heated rhetoric with a tight focus on what he says is the unfairness of U.S. immigration policy.\n\"I have always believed the majority of Americans have seen the unfairness of it all, and it took someone like Donald Trump to articulate it,\" Tancredo said.\nWhat is unfair, he continued, is that immigrants who enter the U.S. illegally are cutting ahead of foreigners who follow protocol. Then they are able to access government benefits, he said — although these generally are restricted to children of immigrants .\nPaying dividends It's an argument some candidates in the Republican field have echoed, notably Trump. \"We have illegal immigrants that are being treated better than our great vets,\" said Trump on the Oct. 11 edition of \"Face the Nation.\"\nHe wants Mexico to pay for a border fence and has called for an end to the practice of birthright citizenship.\nThe approach has paid dividends. Trump is polling first among Republican candidates at 23.4 percent, according to a national poll average compiled Thursday by Real Clear Politics.\nIn trying to explain Trump's popularity, John Andrews, former president of the Colorado Senate, said Trump and Tancredo have connected with voters who don't have the benefit of wealth or the \"privilege of living in the Bush family.\"\nThey are worried about crime, he said. There is economic anxiety, too, bolstered by statistics that show U.S. workers without a college degree — especially men — have seen their median earnings plummet since at least 1990.\n\"That's what Tom Tancredo has tapped into,\" Andrews said. \"That's what Donald Trump is tapping into.\"\nA Quinnipiac University poll from last month found that voters who viewed Trump favorably were more likely to lack a college degree, 38 percent to 31 percent. The same poll showed Bush enjoyed more support from college graduates.\nBut Andrews warned that harsh rhetoric would take a candidate only so far. \"Fear and anger and divisiveness don't ultimately win in Colorado,\" he said.\nYet Trump has stayed atop Republican polls in the months since he launched his campaign with a derogatory attack on Mexican immigrants.\n\"They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime,\" he said at the time . \"They're rapists, and some, I assume, are good people, but I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting.\"\nThe negativity has prompted Latino leaders in Colorado to stage a protest in Boulder on the day of the Republican presidential debate. Plans include the start of a year-long voter-registration drive.\n\"For several months, I have been very frustrated that there has not been major pushback ... against the very vitriolic rhetoric against immigrants,\" said organizer Federico Peña, a former Denver mayor who led the Transportation and Energy departments during the Bill Clinton administration.\n\"The goal is to take the anger — and there is a lot of anger — and transform it into something positive,\" he said.\nBut Peña added this is about more than just rhetoric. It's important that politicians get the policy right, too. Support for efforts such as the 2013 push for immigration — which many Colorado Republicans supported, according to one poll — is imperative, he said.\nAs is the ability to resist the timeless political practice of division in which \"a certain group is scapegoated and blamed for the economic woes of another group,\" he said.\nEducation, economy A 2014 report by the research firm Latino Decisions estimated that \"Hispanics account for 21 percent of the Colorado population and 14 percent of the eligible electorate.\" Those figures are expected to rise in the decades ahead, the authors noted.\nWhile these voters share many of the same concerns as other residents — such as education and the economy — the survey made the case that immigration remains a gateway issue: \"Specifically, 63 percent of Colorado Hispanic voters personally know someone who is an undocumented immigrant.\"\nIt's one reason why pundits and activists — and Democrats — have made the argument that Trump's focus on immigrants and criminality runs the risk of turning off Latino voters from his candidacy, as well as Republican candidates generally.\nIt's a stereotype they say is not supported by evidence, pointing to a recent report from the American Immigration Council that examined U.S. Census data and found immigrant men between ages 18 and 39 were incarcerated in 2010 at about half the rate of that same native-born demographic.\n\"The appeals to the Republican primary electorate about a (border) wall and rapists and murderers — you don't say that to win over Latino voters. You say that to win over a constituency that is not Latino,\" said Sylvia Manzano of Latino Decisions, whose firm is doing work for the Hillary Clinton campaign.\nManzano argued that no matter who emerges from the GOP primary, the eventual nominee would be pulled down in the general election by Trump and the negative tenor of the debate.\n\"Even when you have someone who is Latino-friendly and genuine, the well (of distrust) is so deep, it will take a long time (for the Republican party) to crawl out of it,\" she said.\nNot so, said Josh Penry, the campaign chairman for Rubio in Colorado. \"The idea that voters would hold Carly Fiorina or Marco Rubio responsible for the things that Donald Trump said — I think that's a fiction that a lot of liberals and progressives wish were true but isn't,\" he said.\nViewed unfavorably An August poll from Gallup appears to support that argument. Latino voters had little to say about most of the GOP field with the exception of Trump, who was viewed unfavorably by 65 percent of those polled.\nBut before candidates such as Bush or Rubio get a chance to appeal to Latinos in a general election, they first must win a crowded GOP primary — not an easy task given the two men are polling an average of 7.3 percent and 9.9 percent respectively, according to Real Clear Politics.\nPenry spoke of that challenge when weighing Rubio's chances after the 2013 push to enact immigration reforms. \"There is obviously a real element in the Republican Party for that is a big problem,\" Penry said.\nWith Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., Rubio was one of the so-called \" Gang of Eight \" that steered a package of immigration reforms through the Senate, only to have the measure blocked by Republican leadership in the House.\nThe bill would have extended the fence on the U.S.-Mexico border and increased the number of border agents to about 40,000. It also would have provided a 13-year path to citizenship for immigrants — a provision derided as amnesty by conservative critics.\nAfter the broad compromise failed, Rubio later would say that immigration reform should be done in pieces — starting with security measures. Other Republicans, including Coffman and U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, have followed Rubio's lead by expressing support for reform but not the 2013 bill .\nCoffman, for his part, changed his stance on immigration when redistricting flipped his district from the safe Republican seat once held by Tancredo to one that is much more diverse . Ahead of last year's election, it was about 20 percent Latino.\nFor example, Coffman twice supported efforts to make English the official language but, in his new seat, participated in a Spanish-language debate last year against Democrat Andrew Romanoff. He won re-election by about 9 percentage points.\nThe GOP presidential field needs to \"talk about overhauling our immigration system to make sure it aligns with the needs of our economy,\" Coffman said. \"And I think there needs to be a compassionate element about keeping families together.\"\nCoffman added that he supports a pathway to citizenship for immigrant children but not adults, although he wanted to create some arrangement for parents, such as \"guest worker status.\"\nGiving up on the 2013 immigration bill, however, may not be the political death knell that some conservative activists have described — at least not in Colorado.\nOne survey of Colorado voters from 2013 showed support for the deal among GOP voters. The poll, by Magellan Strategies, looked at three congressional districts that, at the time, were represented by Republicans Gardner, Coffman and Scott Tipton. One question asked whether voters would be more or less likely to support the incumbent if he backed a deal that allowed immigrants to become citizens if they waited 13 years and followed several steps, such as passing a criminal background check, paying a penalty and learning English.\nIn every case, Republican voters said overwhelmingly they would have a more favorable opinion of the incumbent if he backed it; in Tipton's case, it was 48 percent favorable to 18 percent unfavorable.\n\"The research from 2013 clearly indicates that a significant majority of Republican registered voters in three of the most Republican districts in the state ... will support immigration reform legislation,\" said pollster David Flaherty, who previously worked at the Republican National Committee.\nMark K. Matthews: 202-662-8907, mmatthews@ denverpost.com or @mkmatthews\nStaff researcher Vickie Makings contributed to this report.\nJeb Bush\n\"Coming here legally should be easier than coming here illegally.\"\nBen Carson\n\"If we don't seal the border, the rest of this stuff clearly doesn't matter.\"\nTed Cruz\n\"I am the only candidate on this stage who has never supported amnesty and, in fact, who helped lead the fight to stop a massive amnesty plan.\"\nCarly Fiorina\n\"Immigration did not come up in 2016 because Mr. Trump brought it up. ... We have been talking about it for 25 years. This is why people are tired of politicians.\"\nMarco Rubio\n\"We must secure our border, the physical border, with a wall, absolutely. But we also need to have an entry/exit tracking system. Forty percent of the people who come here illegally come legally, and then they overstay the visa.\"\nDonald Trump\n\"I don't think you'd even be talking about illegal immigration if it weren't for me.\"\nSource: Research by The Denver Post\nThe GOP and Immigration What some of the Republican candidates for president are saying", "external_links": ["https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/49868-Immigration4.pdf", "http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/04/02/colorado-congressman-tancredo-announces-2008-white-house-campaign.html?sPage=fnc.politics/youdecide2008", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/face-the-nation-transcripts-october-11-2015-trump-carson/", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/06/16/full-text-donald-trump-announces-a-presidential-bid/", "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/marco-rubio-immigration-reform-118029", "https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/immigration-reform", "http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=2283", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2013/01/28/immigrations-gang-of-8-who-are-they/", "http://www.latinodecisions.com/files/7514/0364/6431/Colorado_Brief_June_2014.pdf", "http://www.gallup.com/poll/184814/hispanics-frown-trump-not-rest-gop-field.aspx", "http://immigrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/docs/the_criminalization_of_immigration_in_the_united_states_final.pdf", "http://www.hamiltonproject.org/assets/legacy/files/downloads_and_links/Employment_Earnings_Occupations_Changes_1990-2013_FINAL_1.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-18T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:04:55.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
