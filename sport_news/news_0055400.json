Here are some interview highlights:\n• Chara scored a goal on a header against the LA Galaxy in the 5-2 win at StubHub Center — \"my first time with a header. I feel good, happy, because that goal helped my team.\n• Chara is listed as being 5-foot-8 and still was able to connect on the cross lofted by Rodney Wallace as he came forward and found space behind the Galaxy defense. How high was that vertical jump? Take a look:\n• Chara has been holding down the defensive midfield by himself in the last two games — both wins — in a single-pivot formation, which he said offers more \"balance\" and focuses on possession. He likes it: \"I feel good. (Darlington Nagbe and Diego Valeri) make my job easy.\n• Chara's work has paid off for the Timbers ' back four defenders.\nNat Borchers says win at LA was 'turning point' Yes, the Timbers scored five goals in a 28-minute span in the second half, but Borchers said the big takeaway is that the came back to win after trailing 1-0 at halftime for the first time this season.\nNat Borchers is one of them and he said Chara in the middle \"takes a lot of pressure off us in terms of our possession because you can give him the ball in any situation under pressure and he can get out of it.\"\n• Borchers also talked about the win at Los Angeles and the five-goal outburst in the second half: \"The biggest takeaway for me is that we were down a goal and came back. It's a turning point for sure for us.\"\n— Molly Blue\nmblue@oregonian.com\n@mollyablue", "external_links": ["http://player.foxfdm.com/sports/embed-iframe.html?videourl=http://link.theplatform.com/s/BKQ29B/JYslG21UliuF?mbr=true&assetTypes=Video&feed=Fox%20Sports%20All&iu=/fscom/soccer/video&policy=51457&player=sportscom-1.7.2&format=SMIL&Tracking=true&Embedded=true&formats=MPEG4,FLV", "https://twitter.com/mollyablue"], "published": "2015-10-21T21:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:25:43.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
