Instead, Miller has not received more than 13 carries in any single game and has just 131 yards rushing through four weeks. \nWith the Dolphins on a bye this week and making serious changes to their coaching staff, Miller hinted that he expects to be a bigger part of the plan going forward. \n— Lamar Miller (@millertime_6) October 8, 2015 @debswim2010 you know it! Stay tune \n— Lamar Miller (@millertime_6) October 8, 2015 @EricThatDude we gone be straight only the beginning! \n— Lamar Miller (@millertime_6) October 8, 2015 \nThe Dolphins recently fired head coach Joe Philbin and defensive coordinator Kevin Coyle, but offensive coordinator Bill Lazor is sticking around — for now. Miller played a larger role for Miami last year as the season went on and ended up averaging a respectable 5.1 yards per carry. He rushed for 270 yards and two touchdowns on 38 carries in the final two games, which left many thinking he could reach his potential in 2015. \nIt hasn’t helped Miller’s fantasy owners that the Dolphins have been getting blown out, but the team needs to find a way to get him more touches. He has proven he can be a playmaker both as a rusher and receiver. Miami needs to get better at playing to its strengths.
