Easy come, easy go. On Wednesday, Dunn was named the Big East’s preseason Player of the Year during the conference’s media day at Madison Square Garden. It’s the latest in a string of tributes for the Providence College point guard heading into the season. “I wouldn’t say I expected any of this but I definitely appreciate it,” Dunn said. “I’ve seen the highs and the lows, so I’m going to remain humble and stay true to myself. So really there’s no pressure on me.” That said, what does Dunn think of talk that come March he could be winning All-American and national player of the year awards? “I would love to be the national player of the year. If it happens, it happens. If it doesn’t I’m still going to keep working,” he said. One look at a list of recent Wooden or Naismith award winners breeds a common thread: the stars all played on good, or even Final Four-level, teams. Last year’s winner was Frank Kaminsky of Wisconsin, which lost in the national championship game. Trey Burke (Michigan) and Anthony Davis (Kentucky) also led their teams to the Final Four. Dunn’s Friars don’t seem equipped to fit that mold. At least that’s the opinion of rival Big East coaches who tabbed the Friars to finish fifth in the conference. But the consensus in the Big East is that if there is a player in college basketball who can elevate his team to greater heights, Dunn is the guy. Listen to the level of praise Xavier coach Chris Mack has for the Friars’ star. “He does raise everybody else,” said Mack. “He has a little more inexperience around him than he did last year but I tell our staff that this kid is as good as I’ve ever seen.” “I was shocked that he didn’t come out (to the NBA Draft),” Mack added. “I saw some prognosticators had him at the end of the first round? To me, they’re nuts. If he stays healthy, Kris has a chance to be a perennial all-star. He has great size and clearly a lot of character. He’s really, really good.” Two years ago, the Big East enjoyed watching the Wooden and Naismith award winner in Creighton’s Doug McDermott. The forward shooter poured in points from every corner of an arena and clearly elevated a rather mundane group of teammates to the Top 25. The Bluejays were bounced in the second round of the NCAA Tournament but McDermott’s impact was unquestioned. Page 2 of 2 - “Two years ago we had the player of the year and this year we have a strong candidate in Kris and that only helps the league attract great players to all of our schools,” said Greg McDermott, Creighton’s coach and Doug’s father. “Doug’s success certainly helped Creighton’s street cred across the country.” McDermott had some words of caution for PC fans who will show up each night expecting a Picasso performance. No player can go it alone and McDermott said the growth of Providence’s younger players is vital if Dunn’s star is to shine bright. “It puts a lot of pressure on Kris because you can’t really have a bad day,” McDermott said. “You maybe get looked at closer because you did come back and people look at the things you don’t do and seem to lose sight of all the great things you can do.” There are no bigger Kris Dunn fans than his teammates. He chose to return to PC to play with them and they all respect the fact that his presence will only make them better. They certainly don’t believe that Dunn can win Big East games by himself. “Can one guy carry the team? Team is not about one guy but I think the leadership of one guy can motivate the rest,” said Ben Bentil, the Friars’ top post player. “It’s about being on the same page as him and helping with the mission he’s trying to accomplish. Kris being on our team gives us an edge to work harder and follow him.” With nine freshmen or sophomores on the roster, the Friars are in desperate need of leaders. That role was ably filled by LaDontae Henton (and to a lesser degree Carson Desrosiers) a year ago but now that job is Dunn’s. “When Kris says something in practice you have to take it in,” Bentil said. “He’s a great player who’s trying to help you. We all learn from him. He’s not criticizing you, he’s trying to push you to be better.” By Kevin McNamara Providence Journal The Bulletin By Kevin McNamara Providence Journal Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 7:45 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:16:34.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
