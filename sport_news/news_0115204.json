The Maroons wound up prevailing on penalty kicks, 3-1, after a 1-1 draw. \nBoth Ridgewood and Mahwah had been there before — not in the same location, but absolutely in a carbon-copy setting. \nThe former is moving on to the quarterfinals of the Bergen County girls soccer tournament at the expense of the latter, a mirror image of the teams’ situation four years ago. The 12th-seeded Maroons knocked off No. 5 Mahwah in last Sunday’s Bergen Round of 16 via penalty kicks, 3-1, after the two sides played to a 1-1 draw in double overtime. \nRidgewood is scheduled face No. 4 Paramus Catholic (8-3-1) at 5:30 p.m. this Sunday in the final game of a quarterfinal quadruple-header at Indian Hills. The winner will face either No. 1 Northern Highlands (13-0) or No. 8 Paramus (8-5-1) in the Oct. 25 semifinals. \nThe Maroons will enter today’s Big North Freedom match at Paramus on a 4-1-3 streak after playing Ramapo (10-2-1), the county’s No. 3 seed, to a scoreless tie in double OT on Tuesday. \n\"It’s been a long time since we had a result other than some sort of loss against [Ramapo],\" Ridgewood coach Jeff Yearing said Wednesday. \"But we’ve always played them close. Very few times is it a multiple-score game.\" \nA check of The Ridgewood News archives showed that the Green Raiders had won all nine meetings since both teams were placed into the Big North in 2010, and five were decided by a single goal. \n\"[Tuesday] night, it boiled down to 0-0, and [Britt] Cunningham came up big in goal a couple times, and our back line was playing extremely well,\" Yearing said. \nThe archives also revealed a telling history of the Ridgewood-Mahwah series in Bergen tournament play. Sunday marked their fifth county meeting since 1998, and all have been in the Round of 16. \nThe last prior match-up came in 2011. Ridgewood had the better seed (8 vs. 9), but Mahwah was the predetermined host site for the game, and the Thunderbirds prevailed on penalty kicks, 4-3, following a 1-1 tie. \nSure enough, the T-Birds (7-2-2) had the better seed going into last weekend, but RHS Stadium had been pegged as the host site ahead of time, so the Maroons enjoyed a bit of home-field advantage. \nThe teams played a scoreless first half before Ridgewood broke through in the 67th minute thanks to its midfield play. Junior center mid Val Diaz set up sophomore outside mid Nicole Macolino for her third goal this season and a 1-0 lead. \nMahwah equalized in the 74th minute when leading scorer Sarah Jordan netted her eighth goal of the year on a breakaway. \nOutside of those two plays, both goalkeepers were rock-solid. The freshman Cunningham made nine regulation saves, including a sliding stop on a Jordan strike in the final two minutes of the second overtime. T-Birds sophomore Michele Silva countered with seven saves, one of which diffused a Ridgewood chance in the last two minutes of the first OT period. \nIn penalty kicks, Cunningham made an additional stop, and the Maroons cashed in when sophomore Mari Fernandez, junior Annie Shaw and freshman Ali Landino all converted their chances. \n\"Ali Landino, we brought her up from the freshman team,\" Yearing said. \"She can be very versatile… we can sub her in for either Nicole Macolino at outside-mid or Riley Ricciardi up top. She’s a good addition.\" \nWith Macolino (No. 22) and Landino (No. 32) each capitalizing on an important scoring chance, Ridgewood now gets to face Paramus Catholic for the second time this fall. PC won a Big North cross-divisional battle, 2-1, on Sept. 24 and also needed PK’s to emerge from the Bergen Round of 16, fending off 13th-seeded Park Ridge, 0-0 (4-2). \n\"We’re a little bit better prepared for what we know that they’ll do offensively,\" Yearing said of the Paladins, \"so we’ll make adjustments on the back line accordingly.\" \nThe coach credited the defensive unit of Lillie Kloak, Alexa Maltz, Hailey Ricciardi and Lafayette-bound junior Emma LaFrance for the Maroons’ recent surge. Along with Shaw and sophomore Carly Schmidt, the group helped Ridgewood post six shutouts in the last eight games. \nThe only loss during that stretch was a 3-0 setback to non-public power Pingry on Oct. 8, three days before the county Round of 16. \n\"That set us up for Mahwah, because of the quality of play we faced against Pingry,\" said Yearing. \"And then, Mahwah gave us an idea of what we needed to do in terms of level of play against Ramapo. \n\"Coming off of Ramapo, they felt very good about what was accomplished,\" he added. \"We would have liked to get the win – and there was a moment with about a minute-and-a-half left in the second overtime where Meghan Devir almost broke through – but we came out of that game very confident knowing that we can play with anybody.\" © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:28:50.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
