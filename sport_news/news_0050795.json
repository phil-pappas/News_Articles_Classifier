A slugfest between two heavyweight championship contenders, and the rubber match of a three-game series that captured the imagination of the entire NFL.Seattle's dramatic 23-17 victory, which was only secured when Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman tipped a pass in the end zone to teammate Malcolm Smith for an interception, represented the pinnacle of what had become one of the NFL's great rivalries.But now, less than two years later, the rivalry between the Seahawks and 49ers has cooled considerably. Thursday night's game between Seattle and San Francisco at Levi's Stadium, which once would have been one of the most highly anticipated games of the season, is now just another game.Sherman was so fired up about the game-winning defensive play in NFC Championship Game that he went on a postgame rant on national television, deriding 49ers receiver Michael Crabtree as “average.”But Sherman's tame reaction to playing the 49ers this week? “(The rivalry) isn't big at all, because we don't think about any game as a rivalry, or any team as a rival. Every game is just the next opponent. They're a division opponent, so obviously you see them more often than not, so you're more familiar with them. But in terms of rivalries, it's not something we concern ourselves with.”It's unlikely that would have been the reaction in 2013, when San Francisco was coming off a NFC championship, Seattle was on its way to a Super Bowl title, and the teams were in the midst of their second straight photo-finish race to the top of the NFC West.Back then both teams had young, exciting quarterbacks — Seattle's Russell Wilson and San Francisco's Colin Kaepernick — capable of beating the defense with both their arms and their legs.Both had intimidating defenses that battered opposing offenses into submission.Both loaded up in the offseason via trade and free-agent signings in an effort to put themselves over the top.And both head coaches, Seattle's Peter Carroll and San Francisco's Jim Harbaugh, had plenty of success in college on the west coast, as well as an apparent dislike for one another.It was arguably the NFL's most-heated rivalry, something the Seahawks had never sniffed before in franchise history.“Some of the hardest-hitting games I've ever been involved in have been Seahawk-49er games,” said first-year 49ers head coach Jim Tomsula, who served as San Francisco's defensive line coach during those rivalry years. “Get down on the sidelines, and I don't know where you are, but to hear those pads cracking, man, you hear some pads cracking.”But the times have changed. Instead of being a game for first place in the NFC West, Thursday's contest pits a pair of floundering 2-4 teams. San Francisco's demise began last season, when the 49ers slumped to a disappointing 8-8 record, and their struggles were expected as the team is in a full rebuild. Seattle comes into the game with more urgency, but that urgency comes simply from trying to turn its season around, rather than beating a hated division rival.The rhetoric in the build-up was muted. Wilson's favorite part about playing San Francisco?“Just to be able to play another game, you know,” Wilson answered.Hardly the reaction of a player motivated to smash its archrival.Also taking some of the heat out of the rivalry is the departure of Harbaugh. He served as a lightning rod, his abrasive nature and sideline antics turning him into a type of cartoon villain Seahawks fans loved to hate. But Harbaugh fled to the college ranks following last season, taking over at his alma matter Michigan, and Tomsula doesn't generate anywhere near the amount of animosity.Indeed Sherman, who railed about Crabtree, who seemed to hold a grudge against Harbaugh based on their time as player and coach at Stanford, couldn't even muster any attitude with regards to Crabtree and Harbaugh no longer being a part of the rivalry.“I'm not going to miss either, because I think I'm still playing,” the usually outspoken Sherman said. “When you're playing this game, you try not to worry about other people as much as you worry about what you can do and what your team does. I think, at the end of the day, we go out there and control what we can control. So I don't think I think about either of those guys very much.”The Seahawks even spent the short week downplaying how strong the rivalry was between the two teams in the first place.“I do watch the Michigan games, I like watching Jim's teams,” Carroll said when asked about Harbaugh's absence. “But that's all. All that talk was really your guys' talk. It was never my talk, it was your guys' talk.”Maybe it really was a product of other people's talk. But is sure didn't look that way on the field. Sadly it now appears to be gone, and it makes Thursday's game between Seattle and San Francisco just that much less compelling.
