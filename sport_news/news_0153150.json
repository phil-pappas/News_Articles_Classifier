Photo: AP (Page 1 of 2) - NEXT PAGE | SINGLE PAGE \nMILTON KEYNES (England) — France endured some uncomfortable moments before pulling away to beat Canada 41-18 in a entertaining and breathless clash yesterday (Oct 2, Singapore time) and close in on the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals with their third successive Pool D win. \nPhilippe Saint-Andre’s men were in control at 17-0 up but Canada, never afraid to counter-attack at pace or spin the ball wide against the beaten 2011 finalists, refused to fold. \nTwo quick tries towards the end of the first half gave Canada a sniff of an upset and it was not well until the last quarter that the French finally wrestled back control as the underdogs tired. \nLate tries from Pascal Pape and Remy Grosso, on his debut, earned France a bonus-point win that takes them top of Pool D on 14 points, four ahead of fellow group heavyweights Ireland who they face in their finale at the Millennium stadium in Cardiff on Oct 11. \nFrance had impressed only in parts in sterile wins over Italy and Romania but appeared ready to shake off the shackles when Wesley Fofana burst over the line after three minutes from Frederic Michalak’s break. \nMore magic from Michalak, whose first penalty took him past Thierry Lacroix’s record for his country of 124 points in World Cups, almost put in Fofana again soon after but he botched the chance. \nFofana was heavily involved in France’s second try, he and fellow midfield battering ram Mathieu Basteraud pinning back the Canucks’ defence before a rolling maul sent hooker Guilhem Guirado over. \nBut Canada, despite losing captain Tyler Ardron to injury, hit back in exhilarating style. \nA brilliant take from the restart by centre Ciaran Hearn sparked an attack finished by left wing DTH Van Der Merwe for his third try of the tournament. \nTheir tails up, Canada attacked the French lines again and pouring forward, Aaron Carpenter picked up from the base of the ruck to score.
