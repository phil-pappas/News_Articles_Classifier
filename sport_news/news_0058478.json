He’s ahead of schedule,” coach Neal Brown said Monday. “He’s going to be able to get some things done this week, but it’s still unknown at this time.” \nSilvers left after getting his helmet knocked off during a play and never returned. \nBrown said the Trojans had put Silvers through their usual concussion protocols. \nAt Monday afternoon’s practice, Silvers wore a green jersey, which is usual for a quarterback. Injured players wear yellow. Silvers also had a brace on his left leg. \n“I think it’ll be a day-to-day type thing,” offensive coordinator Kenny Edenfield said. “We’ll see how it goes. It depends on how he’s moving around. He probably won’t move around until Tuesday or Wednesday.” Troy coach Neal Brown says quarterback Brandon Silvers, who left last weekend's Mississippi State game with an injury, will be a \"game-time decision\" for Saturday's game against Idaho. Stacy Long Troy offensive coordinator Kenny Edenfield says the Trojans are not yet certain of starting quarterback Brandon Silvers' status. Stacy Long Troy coach Neal Brown said the Trojans did put quarterback Brandon Silvers through their concussion protocols. Stacy Long \nSaleem gets call: Freshman Ismail Saleem is in line for his first career start. \nSaleem, a G.W. Carver graduate and former St. Jude Pirate, and sophomore John Johnson moved up on Troy’s depth chart at receiver and are listed as starters. \n“He’s done everything we’ve asked him to do,” Brown said. “He’s been disciplined, he plays the game hard. We have some other guys at that outside-receiver position who haven’t done what we’ve asked them to do. \n“They haven’t played at the effort level that’s needed, they haven’t made enough plays and they haven’t done what they’ve been coached to do. He’s done that.” \nSeniors Bryan Holmes and Jarvis Bentley dropped to second-string status. It’s the second time this year Holmes has been demoted. Troy coach Neal Brown says freshman receiver Ismail Saleem deserves to make his first career start Saturday when the Trojans host Idaho. Saleem is a G.W. Carver graduate. Stacy Long \nOL change: Troy has also swapped around offensive linemen, demoting true freshman Deontae Crumitie after a bad game at Mississippi State. \nLuke Lawrence and Tyler Lassiter will start at the guard positions. The two had split time at left guard while Crumitie had started every game at right guard. \nCrumitie graded a 30 for the MSU game and had a 54 earlier this year vs. Charleston Southern. No other lineman has drawn a failing grade this year. \nChunn hopeful: Backup running back Jordan Chunn, who has missed three games with a broken collarbone, is a “hopeful” to face Idaho, Brown said. \n“He’s been doing agility drills, some non-impact things,” Brown said. “We’ll have a better feel for him this week. His activity is going to pick up. \n“As far as being available for Saturday, we’re hopeful.” Troy coach Neal Brown says the Trojans are hopeful that backup running back Jordan Chunn will return for Saturday's game against Idaho. Stacy Long \nLebbie OK: Defensive end Sam Lebbie, who also left the Mississippi State game with an apparent shoulder injury, wore his regular jersey at Monday’s practice. Troy coach Neal Brown gives a \"quick\" review of Mississippi state game because he's \"trying to forget the first half.\" MSU led 38-0 at halftime and won 45-17.
