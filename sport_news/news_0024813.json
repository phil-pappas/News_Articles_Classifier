USA TODAY Sports USA Today Network Martin Rogers, USA TODAY Sports 11:54 a.m. EDT October 19, 2015 Love Ranch 25 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nLAS VEGAS â€” The dramatic events surrounding Lamar Odom's collapse at a Nevada brothel were regaled in detail by a first-hand witness on Saturday. \nRichard Hunter, media director for the Love Ranch in Crystal, Nev., told HoopsHype.com, a member of the USA TODAY Sports network, how he found Odom in a perilous condition in a suite at the Love Ranch on Tuesday. A female brothel employee had called for help upon finding the former NBA player unresponsive. Lamar Odom has opened eyes and is able to communicate while in hospital \n\"I throw that door open and he's on the bed on his back,\" Hunter said. \"Even before I get to the bed, just coming through the doorway, obviously I know something was terribly wrong because this girl was hysterical. \n\"I hear him snoring louder than I've heard anybody snore in my life. It didn't even sound like a snore. It sounded like a train going by or something so I knew that was a bad sign. \n\"When I jumped up on the bed and I looked at his face he had white foam coming out of his mouth, blood coming out of his nose, some yellow mucusy stuff running down the side of his face.\" \nHunter, who was one of two Love Ranch employees to speak with 911, said Odom's condition had some similarities to the infamous scene in the Quentin Tarantino film Pulp Fiction, where a character played by Uma Thurman suffered a drug overdose.
