Used to be, but one victory in the last three decades? Forget it, at least until the balance sheet starts to look at least a little more, uh, balanced. \nVanderbilt? That matchup does go back and forth, but when the prize is merely the right to say, “We’re not the worst” – that’s not really much of a rivalry, is it? \nThe argument here is for Mississippi State. \nIt’s not a border battle, it’s not an annual matchup of two mirror-imaged underachievers; it’s not even an intra-divisional scrum. But every season, or so it seems, it’s vital to one team, if not both. It’s usually winnable for both in a world where victories are precious for teams struggling for bowl bids and respectability. \nThe Wildcats’ 2006 road win over the Bulldogs came after a UK bye week, which the Cats used to recover from an epic, 49-0 beat-down by a great LSU team. And while we’ll never know if the 34-31 Kentucky victory saved Rich Brooks’ job, it definitely opened the gates on a path that led to the Music City Bowl. \nState was Kentucky’s Homecoming opponent the following season; unfortunately all that hard work on floats and parades went wasted. MSU, catching the Cats after a physical, bitterly disappointing loss to the Florida Tebows, left the Big Blue Nation feeling like a wilted corsage with a 31-14 win. \nKentucky’s 2008 victory in Starkville helped ensure another bowl bid but when the series swung back the other way in ’09, it stayed there. That happened to be the year Mississippi State gave a shot to a first-year head coaching candidate, Dan Mullen. \nWorking under Urban Meyer, Mullen was the quarterbacks coach first at Bowling Green, then at Utah, including the year the Utes, with future NFL #1 draft pick Alex Smith at QB, finished the regular season undefeated. And Mullen followed Meyer to Florida, where he was part of two national championship teams. \nFrom northern Ohio to the mountains of Salt Lake City to the Sunshine State, Mullen learned. He waited, and he learned and in Starkville, it has paid off. The Bulldogs finished 5-7 his first season, which included another successful trip to Lexington. In fact, his MSU teams have never lost to Kentucky. \nA series that went back and forth, with the visiting team winning each time over a span of four seasons, has either stagnated (if you’re a UK fan) or prospered (from the Bulldog point of view). They’ve played 42 times. Each team has won 21, with State taking the last six. It’s been 2,548 days since the Wildcats last hushed the cowbells. Dan Mullen is the reason. \nMullen inherited enough talent from his predecessor, Sylvester Croom, to scratch out those five wins his first year. Meanwhile, he rat-holed talent, red-shirting as many players as he could. State played in a bowl game the following season and hasn’t missed the post-season since, making five consecutive trips. Last year the Bulldogs spent five weeks as the nation’s top-ranked team. \nMSU said goodbye to a lot of veterans after that joyful time; the ‘Dogs feature 15 first-year starters – but 21 of their starting 22 are juniors or seniors. And one of them is a quarterback who has developed into perhaps the greatest icon in the history of the program. \nDak Prescott during his career has thrown more than 50 touchdowns and run for more than 30. Two other SEC quarterbacks have done that: Mr. Tebow and Mr. Football, Johnny Manziel. Lofty company, indeed.The Cats have to find their way – to Prescott, who’s already passed for 1,700 yards and run for another 250, and into the red zone, where Kentucky has converted 21 of 22 times, with 15 touchdowns. \nIf they don’t, the rivalry will tilt toward the Maroon, and it will be Mississippi State becoming one step closer to yet another bowl bid. MSU is where UK wants to be. \n(Dick Gabriel is in his 26th year with the UK Radio and TV network.
