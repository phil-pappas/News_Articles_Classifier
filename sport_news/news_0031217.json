In 2015, the district estimated 8,000 to 11,000 visitors.\nOfficials said they'd noticed particularly heavy use in the past year and decided to test the water. \"There's not a lot of water cycling through,\" Tyree noted, hence the high E. coli levels last month.\nThe hot springs eventually flow into the North Umpqua River.\nFederal officials will continue to monitor and test the water, but it's possible the hot springs will remain closed until June 2016.\nAccording to a news release, the forest service is \"working on a long-term solution\" to address public safety issues.\n-- Andrew Theen\natheen@oregonian.com\n503-294-4026\n@cityhallwatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:09:58.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
