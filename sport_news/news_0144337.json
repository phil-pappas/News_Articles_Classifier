Punter Pat O'Donnell (right knee) is probable.\nThirteen players are questionable, the offensive line has been hit hard, and a wide receiver is hurting as well.\nSome of those who are questionable, like quarterback Jay Cutler, who practiced all week, are almost certain to play. Others, like wide receiver Alshon Jeffery, who didn't practice at all Friday, are not expected to be active. The other starting wide receiver, Eddie Royal, is also questionable and didn't practice all week.\n\"It's kind of par for the course so far this season,\" coach John Fox said. \"We've had the injury bug, kind of, in a variety of positions. It's kind of the nature of what we do.\"\nOn the O-line, right tackle Kyle Long has been limited all week with back and ankle injuries. Patrick Omameh, who filled in at left guard last week after Matt Slauson moved to center, did not practice all week with an ankle injury. Rookie backup offensive tackle Tayo Fabuluje was limited with an ankle injury.\nThe other questionable players are: linebackers Pernell McPhee (shoulder/did not practice Friday) and Shea McClellin (elbow), defensive linemen Jeremiah Ratliff (ankle) and Will Sutton (elbow), cornerbacks Alan Ball (groin) and Sherrick McManis (hamstring) and quarterback Jimmy Clausen (back).\nFor the Chiefs, linebacker Josh Mauga (groin/Achilles) is out and wide receiver Albert Wilson (shoulder) is questionable.\nRelated Article\nWill Dave Toub's special teams hurt Bears on Sunday?
