Seagate won the 2012 title in France and again in Ecuador last year. \nThe book title is also significant. \nIt's one of the enduring ironies of the world adventure racing circuit that one of its most experienced and respected competitors also suffers from a condition entirely at odds with the demands of one of the most physically and mentally challenging sports on the planet. \nIn 1999, Fa'avae was diagnosed with atrial flutter, an abnormal heart rhythm, which after supposedly corrective surgery in 2001, unexpectedly escalated to atrial fibrillation. \nA subsequent procedure in 2005 proved much more successful and just three years ago, Fa'avae led Seagate to the Adventure Racing World Championship title in France. Ad Feedback \nThen, just two weeks prior to the team's departure for last year's Expedition Africa event, he found himself lying in the emergency department at Nelson Hospital nervously watching the fluctuating heart rate monitor \"with alarms sounding around me and beeping like crazy\". \nBut not only did Fa'avae make the start-line, Seagate went on to win the race to add another indelible chapter to an already inspiring story. The book's been some time in the making. \n\"It really started in 2006 after I first retired from adventure racing after the 2005 world champs,\" Fa'avae said. \n\"I started writing it, largely because I was getting out on the New Zealand corporate speaking circuit and the speakers who I was listed with said, `it would be really good if you could write a book as a really good way of marketing yourself as a speaker'.\" \nHe actually shelved the idea after making an initial attempt before eventually picking it up again. \n\"I've always enjoyed writing and I've sort of kept doing it, more as a diary than anything. But I guess the real trigger was when Mum died in that accident a couple of years ago and I just thought, `now's probably a good time', it just felt like something I could do for Mum really and, I guess, just keep her legacy alive and to acknowledge the life that she provided for me.\" \nFa'avae's mother, Jan Fa'avae, 69, died after her car plunged into Saltwater Creek near Port Nelson in 2013. \nFa'avae said that the book certainly hasn't focused entirely on his competitive career. \n\"What I didn't want it to be was purely a sports book that was just about racing and winning or losing races. I guess I wanted to write something that had wider appeal. \n\"It gives a bit of insight into adventure racing but that's all incorporated into different things that have interested me in my life.\" \nBesides being one of the world's best adventure racers, Fa'avae's also been in involved in outdoor education and event management. \n\"I wanted to blend all the things I've been doing into one story. Adventure racing's certainly the vehicle for telling my story, because that's obviously been the main thread throughout my adult life really. \n\"I guess for myself personally, I've exposed myself more in the sense of [talking about] my heart condition that I've battled with for a long time. I've never really spoken to people about it, even people that are really close to me don't really know what went on and what it was like to try and compete and deal with that. \n\"I guess it's quite insightful and I hope that people can find it interesting and potentially inspiring.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:47:28.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
