Krikorian’s group has been firing on all cylinders, and that continued Saturday against North Carolina. \nThe No. 2 Seminoles used a late goal from forward Berglind Thorvaldsdottir to grab a 1-0 victory over UNC in front of a home crowd of 2,034 in the Seminole Soccer Complex. \n“It felt so good (to get the goal),” Thorvaldsdottir said. “This was a really tough game. They’re a physical team, but I think we matched them. It was a good game and it felt really good to score a goal.” \nThe goal – scored in the 79th minute – was Thorvaldsdottir’s sixth of the year, and it led to FSU’s first win over the No. 1 team in the nation since a 2006 victory over Portland. It was also Florida State’s seventh win all-time over UNC. \nNo other program has as many wins over UNC as Florida State. \n“It was fantastic,” Krikorian said. \n“I thought overall the performance was very solid. We limited the number of chances (UNC) had at our goal. I think in the first half we had some very good looks and we look precise enough with our finishing. Overall, to play a team of that quality and find a way to win the game is very satisfying.” \nFlorida State came out firing early with 12 shots in the first half against the Tar Heels. UNC clamped down on defense in the second half, and FSU only managed three shots. The Tar Heels took five shots in both halves and had just two shots on goal for the game. \nFSU goalkeeper Cassie Miller, who had two saves and also set up Thorvaldsdottir’s goal, said Florida State is still getting better. \n“Me and Berglind, me and Cheyna and all of the other forwards, we have a good connection,” Miller said. “I just played the ball forward and she did the rest.” \nKrikorian commended his goalkeeper for the heads-up play. Miller sent the ball over the heads of UNC’s entire team and it landed in front of Thorvaldsdottir, who sent the ball inside the left post from about 15 yards out. \n“Cassie Miller continues to distinguish herself as among the best goalkeepers in the country,” Krikorian said. “It was a heck of a kick and a well-timed run by Berg and a class finish. Overall, you couldn’t script it any better, in that regard.” \nUNC started the week ranked No. 1, but will likely drop following back-to-back losses (the Tar Heels lost on Thursday to Louisville in overtime). Krikorian said he isn’t concerned with the nation’s perception of his team – he’s just looking to prepare the group for its next game. \nThe Seminoles (12-1-1) play Louisville and Virginia Tech this week, and both games are on the road. \n“I think we’re a good team,” Krikorian said. \n“We’re going to continue to fight hard and we’re going to work to get better every day. Whatever message anyone takes out of it isn’t my business. We’re just going to keep our focus on us and get better every time we come out.” 381 CONNECT 11 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.tdo.com/1LpA9dn TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:17:07.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
