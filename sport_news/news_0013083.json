(AP Photo/Rick Osentoski) Article \nInsight, hindsight and foresight as we segue from Week 5 to Week 6 in NFL action: \nOPENING KICKOFF \nFor starters: perspective on the big news \nThere is no quarterback controversy in Detroit, head coach Jim Caldwell insisted after Sunday’s 42-17 loss to Arizona. \nHe’s right, in a way. \nEven if most skeptics and long-time observers of the Detroit Lions believe time has run out on quarterback Matthew Stafford, the first overall draft pick in 2009, whose miserable regression shows no signs of halting. \nCaldwell yanked Stafford in the third quarter Sunday, after Stafford’s third interception set up Arizona to go up 35-7. Stafford’s backup, Dan Orlovsky, finished the game. \nEven before Caldwell took a question at his post-game news conference, he attempted to pre-empt speculative queries and insisted, flat-out, that Stafford remains his No. 1 passer. \n“I know you guys will ask me this,” Caldwell said. “Really, it’s like a pitcher not having a very good day, and the first pitcher comes out and that pitcher, obviously, he’s still the starter. \n“(Stafford)’s still our starter, so there will be no issues there. So there’s no quarterback controversy or anything of that nature.” \nStafford’s completion percentage isn’t bad this season -- 62.5%. But then his positive stats seldom are. It’s always been the easy passes he misses, and the mistakes he regularly makes, that drive Lions fans nuts. \nEven at his best in 2011 and 2012, when he threw for a combined 10,005 yards and 61 touchdowns, Stafford was still far too mistake-prone. Thirty-three interceptions in those two years alone. And 39 in the two-plus seasons since. \n“We just didn’t play well. It starts with me,” Stafford said Sunday night. “I’ve got to play better.” \nAt halftime Caldwell proved he was no Knute Rockne when he made the curious decision to inform Stafford he’d be pulled if he threw another pick in the second half. Nice pep talk. \n“Obviously, I threw one,” the 27-year-old said. “Wish I wouldn’t have. Go from there.” \nStafford is Exhibit A for the case that elite NFL quarterbacking isn’t only about arm strength or a fast release. It’s about so much more. Especially accuracy and blunder avoidance. \nYou can blame Stafford’s blunders on his undisciplined delivery, his faulty decision-making, or both. Fact is, he hasn’t lived up to his No. 1 overall draft-pick billing. Seven years and no playoff wins later, Detroit is the league’s last remaining winless team, at 0-5. \nIf Caldwell had a viable backup QB to turn to, he would -- and should -- bench Stafford. But Orlovsky? He was a big part of the problem in 2008, starting 10 of those 16 straight losses. The Lions can’t go back to him. Just can’t. \nAnd they can’t trade Stafford. He’s due to earn $33.5 million over the next two seasons. \nSo Caldwell was right. There is no quarterback controversy in Detroit. Just a quarterback quandary. \nStafford was supposed to lead the Lions out of the pit of winlessness, not back into it. \nTRENDS NOT COINCIDENCES \nIt happened again, so it will probably happen again \n1. Bruce Arians, as head coach of the Cardinals and interim head coach of the Colts, is 6-0 vs. the NFC North. \n2. Marcus Mariota has thrown eight touchdown passes in four games. The only other rookie QB ever to do it was Miami’s Dan Marino in 1983. Mariota is throwing TD passes against good and bad defences alike. Plus he’s a savvy runner who picks his spots. Future fantasy star. \n3. Russell Wilson has been sacked 22 times already. That extrapolates to 70 over a full season. His average through three NFL seasons: 40 sacks per year. \nSTAT OF THE WEEK \nAfter Week 5 two years ago, the Denver Broncos averaged 46 points per game. After Week 5 this year, half that -- 23 points per game. \nIt’s just another revealing measure of the stunning dropoff in Denver’s offensive production since late last season. Peyton Manning hasn’t looked the same since. \nThe offence’s ineffectiveness was on display again Sunday, when Manning failed to engineer a touchdown. The Broncos defence did score one, the decisive pick-six by CB Chris Harris. \nA chunk of the offensive dropoff from 2013 to now is attributable to Denver’s overhauled receiver corps. Manning made the most of the league’s best group of pass-catchers in 2013: WRs Demaryius Thomas, Wes Welker and Eric Decker, plus TE Julius Thomas. \nManning still has Demaryius Thomas, but no Welker, no Decker, no Julius Thomas. That trio has been replaced by Emmanuel Sanders, Jordan Norwood and Owen Daniels -- not as dynamic. \nHere’s another stat that chronicles the plummet. Two years ago this week the Denver offence was converting 58.3% of third downs, the best rate in the league. This year so far: 32.4%, third worst rate in the league. \nAnd yet, just as they were two years ago, the Broncos are 5-0. \nHERO \nEli Manning, QB, Giants. \nThe other Manning brother has blown enough leads this season and in recent years. So let’s give him his due after Sunday night’s incredible comeback to knock off San Francisco, 30-27, which lifted the Giants atop the NFC East with a 3-2 record. \nWith 21 seconds remaining, Manning hit Larry Donnell from 12 yards out for the winning score. On the night, Manning was 41-of-54 for 441 yards and three TDs. \nZERO \nGreg Hardy, DE, Cowboys. \nNever mind that he had a monster game Sunday in his return to NFL action -- after a four-game suspension to begin this season, and after missing last year on the commissioner’s exempt list, all for roughing up his then-girlfriend and throwing her onto a futon covered in guns. \nOn Sunday, Hardy hit Patriots QB Tom Brady five times and sacked him twice, and also forced a fumble. Fine. Everyone knows Hardy is a premier pass rusher. \nHe’s also a premier jerk off the field. \nLast week, in his first interview in ages, the tin-eared Hardy spoke about how hot Brady’s model wife is, and that he planned to come out with “guns blazing” in his return to action. \nThen on Saturday, a rap video Hardy made a few months ago surfaced. Strippers and guns are featured prominently in it. \nThese are not the actions of a man touched by a single drop of remorse. \nSTOCK UP \nChris Johnson, RB, Cardinals. \nRemember the former Titans star, whom the team couldn’t give away a year ago last spring, and who did nothing last fall as a New York Jet? Arizona head coach Arians remembered him, and acquired him this past off-season. The speedy back ran for 103 yards on only 11 carries in the Cards’ big win at Detroit -- giving him 296 yards over the past three games. \nSTOCK DOWN \nAndy Reid, head coach, Chiefs. \nHis offensive line is a disaster, understood. But he’s supposed to be the offensive guru who can overcome such limitations, such as those of the quarterback he sought and got two years ago, Alex Smith. Even before RB Jamaal Charles blew out his right knee against Chicago on Sunday, the Chiefs offence wasn’t scaring anybody. \nINSIDE FOOTBALL \nSituation: Overtime at Baltimore. \n“Joshy Football” -- quarterback Josh McCown -- and the Cleveland Browns faced a third-and-one at their own 44. Baltimore had already punted in OT, so the Browns could win with a field goal. \nAll game long, Browns coaches kept empowering McCown to lead them to victory through the air, not on the ground. They stayed true to that philosophy on this key down, and with a pre-snap wrinkle. \nThe Browns lined up in a power-running bunch formation -- then shifted out into a five-wide shotgun, to eliminate any run threat. Tight end Gary Barnridge was closest to McCown of three receivers split to the right. \nThe Ravens scrambled to realign their defence, manning up with each receiver. Linebacker C.J. Mosley pressed up to Barnridge. \nMcCown looked at Barnridge as he ran a quick in (or dig) route to the left. But then Barnridge stopped hard, reversing direction to instead run an out to the right. Mosley couldn’t change directions as fast; Barnridge shook him completely. \nMcCown hit Barnridge going right, and the tight end turned it up for 19 yards, down to the Baltimore 37 -- almost to within Travis Coons’ field-goal range. \n“I think defences pay (Barnridge) attention,” McCown said Monday. “But he just has the ability to get open, and I trust his ability to do that … It’s just the way we’re constructing plays, and then his ability just to win versus man coverage.” \nNine plays later, Coons drilled an easy 32-yard winner. \nACTUAL QUOTE \n“I think it shows a lot of the character and toughness of the men in the room … but it’s not something we’ll spend a lot of time talking about.” -- Falcons head coach Dan Quinn, not sounding surprised his team is 5-0. \nACTUAL TWEET \n“My heart is with my brothers tonight. Get that W, G-men. I love every one of you #thiswillnotdefeatme” -- Giants TE Daniel Fells (@danielfells85) from hospital, where he’s battling a staph infection and faces the prospect of having to have a foot amputated. \nQUARTERBACK RANKINGS \nMy Top 20, tweaked after Sunday games (last week’s rankings in brackets) 1.

Former Baltimore Ravens head coach Brian Billick on Sunday morning tweeted the following jab: \n“Yes kickers are people too, but they’re not football players.” \nOuch. \nSeattle Seahawks punter Jon Ryan -- the pride of Regina, Sask. -- didn’t take that potshot quietly. He immediately jumped on Twitter to slam Billick for never having even played in the NFL: \n“Here’s @CoachBillick’s stats as an NFL ‘football player’: 0 games played, 0 catches for 0 yards. Oh and 0 (field goal) attempts.” \nRyan sure looked like a football player when he threw that touchdown pass in the NFC championship game last January. And when he makes the occasional tackle. \nBillick later deleted his offensive tweet, but then followed up with this a couple hours later, when asked by a follower what he’d say to Matt Stover, the Ravens’ top placekicker while he was head coach. \n“Matt was one of my favourites & truly an integral part of our team,” Billick tweeted. “But not a football player. He taught me that.” \nLesson not learned. \n1. The top eight teams in passing yards are a combined 23-15. \n2. The bottom eight teams in passing yards are a combined 18-20. \n3. Raiders S Charles Woodson, age 39, is the league’s co-leader with four interceptions. \n4. Bills starting CBs Ronald Darby (11) and Stephon Gilmore (10) lead the NFL with most passes defensed. \n5. The Lions are 0-5 for the fourth time this century. \nKNOW YOUR HISTORY \nHow much did they run the ball in the early 1970s? This much. It was 43 years ago this week -- on Oct. 15, 1972 -- when John Riggins and Emerson Boozer of the New York Jets became the first teammates to both rush for 150+ yards in a game. Riggins gained 168, Boozer exactly 150 in a 41-13 defeat of the New England Patriots. \nTHIS WEEK \nQuick thoughts on Week 6 games (all on Sunday unless noted) \n-Falcons at Saints, Thursday, 8:25 ET: Expect fans to start hiding their faces again at the Superdome. \n-Bengals at Bills, 1ET: Can Cincinnati leave the Ralph still undefeated? If it protects Andy Dalton, sure. \n-Broncos at Browns, 1ET: The really hot, prolific, record-breaking QB … and Peyton Manning. \n-Bears at Lions, 1 ET: It’s not the Owen Five Bowl. But if Detroit can’t get its first win here, hooboy. \n-Texans at Jaguars, 1 ET: Both 1-4. First of many remaining AFC South matchups with only draft implications. \n-Chiefs at Vikings, 1 ET: Vikings’ pass rush licking its chops already, sizing up KC’s terrible OL. \n-Redskins at Jets, 1 ET: Mirror teams: good defences, good running attacks, iffy QBs at best. \n-Cardinals at Steelers, 1 ET: Hey, Mike Tomlin. Bruce Arians is coming for revenge. \n-Dolphins at Titans, 1 ET: Can Miami get it together for rah-rah interim head coach Dan Campbell? \n-Panthers at Seahawks, 4:05 ET: Cam Newton still won’t be able to solve a now angry Seattle D. \n-Chargers at Packers, 4:25 ET: Phil Rivers vs. Aaron Rodgers. Despite Chargers OL injuries, still could be fun. \n- Ravens at 49ers, 4:25 ET: These teams, both 1-4, were in the Super Bowl three years ago. Man. \n-Patriots at Colts, 8:30 ET: Ya gotta think Indy is in for a world of Deflate-gate hurt. \n- Giants at Eagles, Monday, 8:30 ET: How will the Giants nearly blow it this week? \nBYES: Cowboys, Raiders, Rams, Bucs \nGUARANTEED LOSERS \n2 teams that won’t win this week \nKinda the opposite of a suicide pool. I can pick a team only once all season, so 32 teams over the NFL schedule’s final 16 weeks. Last week’s picks: Cleveland (which won in OT at Baltimore) and New Orleans (which got smoked at Philly). This week’s picks: Carolina (at Seattle) and Indianapolis (vs. New England). \nSeason record: 6-2. \nTAKING A KNEE \nThis week’s winder-upper \nBack to Eli Manning. His fourth-quarter comeback victory Sunday night, in the waning seconds against San Francisco, was the 27th of his career. No other QB has as many since 2004, when the younger Manning entered the NFL. \nHe was asked afterward: Was this one as satisfying as any? \n“Well, there were a couple in the Super Bowl, obviously,” Manning said, laughing. \nTill next week …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:36:48.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
