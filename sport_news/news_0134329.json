Gorrell died in his sleep Friday night in his freshman dorm at Nevada. TERRY PIERSON/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Related article » Former Riverside North standout and Nevada freshman catcher Austin Gorrell died in his sleep on Friday night. He was 19 years old.\nGorrell was diagnosed with an enlarged heart about one month ago, according to Huskies baseball coach Steve Madril. The diagnosis meant Gorrell was not going to be able to play in college for Nevada, but he was still kept on as a member of the program and listed on the official Wolf Pack team roster online.\n“He was a great kid with a great passion for the game,” Madril said. “It’s been an awful day for the entire North community.”\nGorrell was a two-year varsity baseball member at North before going to Nevada as a recruited walk-on.\nMessages of grief spread quickly on social media following news of his passing.\nMultiple Nevada baseball players changed their Twitter avatars to a picture of the number 20, Gorrell’s jersey number. Nevada running back Don Jackson wrote the No. 20 on his tape for the Wolf Pack’s football game against New Mexico.\nNevada outfielder Brandon Evans tweeted Saturday morning “My heart hurts for my teammate and his family. You were always so positive through this hard time. RIP Austin Gorrell. Love you buddy.”\nEvans dedicated the season to Gorrell in another Tweet posted later Saturday.\n“Last night he told me ‘All I wanted was one game on this field,’” Evans’ tweet said. “Every game this season is yours.”", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw4bk1-ax09947da9.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw4bk1-ax09947da9.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:22:53.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
