It is the elevated train stop closest to Wrigley Field: Addison.\nThat is the name of a street that borders this timeless ballpark, which is under renovation on the outside but as charming as ever within. It is also the first name of the 21-year-old shortstop who has been a pillar of the Cubs’ reconstruction.\nAddison Russell started at short against the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 3 of this National League division series on Monday. He has not started anywhere else since Aug. 6, his last day as the regular second baseman before the Cubs switched him with Starlin Castro, a three-time All-Star.\n“That one particular move right there, probably more than anything we did this year, set us up for this moment,” Manager Joe Maddon said. “When we went and got Addy at short and Starlin eventually at second base, it kind of tightened things up, and I think we’ve played a better brand of baseball since then.”\n Related Coverage Cubs 6, Cardinals 3: Cubs Defeat Cardinals to Even Division Series OCT. 10, 2015 Cardinals 4, Cubs 0: Cardinals’ Pitching Stifles Cubs, and St. Louis Follows a Familiar Script OCT. 9, 2015 Maddon praised Castro for the way he handled the switch. After some time to nurse his ego and learn a position he had not played in six years, Castro has thrived at second base. He hit .366 from Aug. 24 through the end of the regular season.\nRussell, perhaps, was destined to be the Cubs’ shortstop from the moment the team acquired him in a trade with Oakland last July 4. Maddon noticed his smooth fundamentals on the back fields in spring training, the way he picked up grounders with no wasted motion. Russell had never played above Class AA, but his polish stood out.\nBefore Game 3, Russell credited Karl Jernigan, a family friend and a former minor leaguer, with teaching him the basics when he was 8 to 12 years old.\nOn Baseball A regular analytical column looking at major league baseball.
