The 2014 first round pick was the odd forward out on opening night, and will have to wait to make his NHL debut for a few more days. The local product has said all the right things about waiting for his time to break in, and could get a chance to do so on the California trip later this week.\nCalgary’s lineup will look a little bit different, most notably in goal, where veteran Jonas Hiller will make his first start of the season opposite Ryan Miller. There are still plenty of questions surrounding Calgary’s goaltending situation, as they have decided to hold three on the roster with Hiller, Kari Ramo, and Joni Ortio.\nNo matter who is between the pipes on the other side, the simple goal for the Flames is a better effort, something that the Canucks expect.\n“I know they (Calgary) were really dissapointed with their game (on Wednesday). Dejardins said this morning after an optional morning skate.\n“I thought it was a fairly close game (Wednesday). I think we’ll see a similar game, maybe they go harder. I don’t think they’ll change a lot of what they do. Maybe they think their intensity has to be higher, but I would expect them to be ready and playing hard tonight.”\nRelated Stories Big crowd expected at Rogers Arena tonight for the Canucks home opener Canucks open the season by beating the Flames Canucks | flames | nhl", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T23:05:41.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
