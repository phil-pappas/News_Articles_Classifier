Obviously they're number one in scoring in many offensive categories. I think defensively we did a good job at times. Obviously, they scored more points than we did and ended up winning the game.\" \nSenior defensive end Mike Moore says, \"Its definitely tough. Its definitely frustrating also with what we did both defensively and offensively. We just have to get back into the film room and fix every bit.\" \nJohns says, \"We were in it. Its not like they were that much better than us. Our defense played their hearts out. Unfortunately, the offense didn't get it done today.\" \nVirginia finished with five total turnovers to North Carolina's two and was out-gained 422 to 353 yards. \nThe Cavaliers return to Scott Stadium Halloween Saturday to host Georgia Tech for a 3:00 p.m. kick off.
