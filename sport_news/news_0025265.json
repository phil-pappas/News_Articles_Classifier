The Vikings (17-6, 12-2) outscored the Titans 16-3 to build a commanding 17-8 lead in the first set after dropping five of the first six points of the match. Guilford then jumped ahead 12-3 in the second set to put Boylan at a deficit that it wasn't able to come back from. \"Some of our rotations were stronger than others,\" Guilford coach Julian Jacques said, \"And when we get in those strong rotations we get comfortable and sometimes things start to flow for us and that was the case tonight. We just got into a couple of those rotations where we just scored a bunch of points that gave us a little bit of a cushion. The straight-set victory continued what's been a strong season for the Vikings, who were able to frustrate the Titans by keeping plays alive with solid defense and passing, which led to opportunities for their offense. \"We all work really hard in practice to keep plays going,\" Guilford's Celene Morris said. \"Yesterday we worked on keeping the ball in play, which is what we did tonight. That was our goal and I feel like we accomplished it.\" Morris was part of an effective one-two punch at the net for Guilford. She and Naomi Johnson each had nine kills apiece to lead the Viking attack. \"When they're on fire they're tough to contend with,\" Jacques said. \"When they're hitting smart shots, they're tough. You hit a couple of rolls shots and mix it up, it really puts the defense on their heels and they had some good shots tonight.\" Good shots were few and far between for Boylan, which had 19 attacking errors in the match, with a handful of them coming early in the second set. \"You can't play a team like Guilford and have six hitting errors in the first half of a set and expect to come back from that,\" Boylan coach Bill McLaughlin said. \"They're a talented team and they get the credit for taking advantage of our plight. When we started getting points back on blocks, we were fighting up a big hill. We had already given up a lot of points. So when we had our run, it was a deep hole to climb out of.\" By Adam Kradle", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:45:27.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
