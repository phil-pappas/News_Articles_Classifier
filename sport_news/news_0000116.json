It's a massive game and another chance for a win.\" \nManager Brendan Rodgers named a young team in south-west France and plans to use the competition to give some academy graduates a chance to impress. \n\"Our approach to this game is how it's been in the competition - this is an opportunity for young players and an opportunity for players on the fringe of the team that aren't getting so many games,\" he said. \nOne of those academy graduates who has already made an impression on the first team is Jordan Rossiter. \n\"He's a young player that is developing well. He has a strong personality,\" he added. \n\"He and the other young guys did very well in the last game. \n\"He'll be in contention again for the game tomorrow.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T09:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T17:42:27.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
