The coaches who yell, demean and are downright negative are becoming fewer and fewer. \nThat weekend, I covered football games on the sidelines of Salem and Windham and was impressed with the positive vibes from both coaching staffs. Salem head coach Rob Pike and Windham’s Bill Raycraft and their staffs were positive and supportive, even when things weren’t going well. \nI was particularly impressed with Windham assistant Jack Byrne, who was constantly pumping up his defense throughout the game, even after Sanborn’s lone touchdown. \nWinnekenni cited \nWinnekenni Park in Haverhill, where Haverhill High runs cross country meets, has been cited by the magazine Men’s Journal as one of eight “bucket list” places in the country for trail running. \nA brief synopsis cites the miles of trails, including a pleasant 4.7-mile loop around Lake Kenoza and states that the “wide, smooth dirt paths over rolling terrain let you zone out on a mellow run, or crank out speed work without much in the way of trail obstacles. Views abound. ...” \nVeteran race runners like Bradford’s Dan Verrington and Dave Dunham and Newton’s Mark Behan are among those who regularly work out at Winnekenni and would surely agree with the ranking. \nCasaletto out fast \nAustin Prep sophomore Stephanie Casaletto of Groveland got off to a good start to the fall season at the Frank Kelley Invitational in Wrentham the weekend before last. She won the Division 2 individual title. finishing the 5K course in 19:04.18. Newburyport’s Jack Carleo won the Division 2 boys crown. \nUMass recruits \nThe University of Massachusetts men’s basketball team hasn’t played a game yet but it’s already having a good season on the recruiting trail. One day after receiving commitments from a pair of high profile recruits from New Orleans, UMass landed four-star recruit Chris Baldwin, a 6-foot-8, 235-pound forward from Notre Dame Prep in Fitchburg. \nHe will join four-star guard DeJon Jarreau and three-star forward Brison Gresham, both from New Orleans. \nHaverhill connection \nThere was a Haverhill connection at the Smuttynose Rockfest Half-Marathon in Hampton over the weekend. The winner was former Haverhill High runner Tim Catoggio, who currently lives in Boston, with a fine time of 1:11.24 for 13.1 miles. Catoggio was actually the second finisher the race, the first being 25-year-old Devan Kucker, another former Hillie and the winner of the wheelchair division. He was clocked in 1:07.39. \nDream matchup? \nIt wouldn’t happen until the Division 1 playoffs but who wouldn’t want to see Andover and St. John’s Prep clash on the gridiron? Both teams’ quarterbacks and top receivers are battling for the top numbers in Eastern Mass. \nAfter three games, the Prep’s Oliver Eberth of Andover had eight TD passes, one more than Andover’s E.J. Perry while, on the receiving end, Hayden Rockett of St. John’s had seven TD receptions, one more than Andover’s Dan Gemmell. \nNot permanently! \nI had no serious problem with the announcement by the MIAA last week that the state high school basketball championships next March will be played in Springfield. After all, Springfield is supposedly the birthplace of the sport. \nWhat bothered me was the statement that, if the games go well, Springfield might become a permanent site. In my view, if it’s not shared between East, Central and West, it should remain in the central location of Worcester. \nWith your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T11:18:48.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
