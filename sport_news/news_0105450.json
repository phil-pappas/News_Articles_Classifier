One of the men pulled out a semi-automatic handgun and forced them to lie down and empty their pockets.\nThe two armed men then took the skateboarder's belongings and fled the scene in an unidentified vehicle according to NOPD.\nWord of the armed robbery didn’t surprise neighbors. One couple we spoke with said that their home has been vandalized and broken into numerous times, making crime like this par for the course.\nKathryn Gibson, an Algiers resident, said that people are fed up.\n“People here are moving out,” Gibson said. “They got for sale signs all over the place. People are just getting out of here.”\nNOPD officials say arrests have been made as of Wednesday morning. Fox 8 will update this story as more information becomes available.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
