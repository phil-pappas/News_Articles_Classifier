The Confederations Cup is essentially a dress rehearsal for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. \nThe stakes are high for the U.S., so Klinsmann went with experience wherever he could with his roster selection for Saturday's game. Damarcus Beasley was called to the team, while Fabian Johnson appears to be healthy and ready to play at outside back. Meanwhile, Michael Bradley and Clint Dempsey will likely be asked to play a significant role in the team's play Saturday. \nMeanwhile, El Tri will not have Giovani Dos Santos for Saturday's game, as he suffered an injury while playing with his MLS Club, the Los Angeles Galaxy. Javier \"Chicharito\" Hernandez will likely play a key role in his team's offense, while Andres Guardado will serve as a leader in the midfield. \nHere's where to catch the game online: Live Streaming \nFoxSports Go - Like the services that ESPN and NBC provide, this comes with a TV subscription and it available for desktop and mobile (including iOS and Android). Fox Soccer 2GO – Fox Soccer 2Go is a paid service that requires no TV subscription. \nFox Soccer 2GO App - Same as above, but allows viewers to catch the game on their mobile devices or any other streaming service out there. \nUnivision Deportes En Vivo Extra - The Univision streaming service. For those looking for a Spanish live stream, this is where you should go. \nFirstRowSports - The desperate, advanced option. If you can't use any of the above options, you can try FirstRowSports ( alternate option here ). Warning: Many of these streams are loaded with sketchy adds and will put you as risk for downloading some adware crap that you don't want. However, it is free and in English, save for the rare foreign feed. AdBlock plus is recommended (also patience). Radio There will be no traditional radio broadcast of the game, but Sirius XM subscribers will get Fox Sports' live play-by-play simulcast on channel 94.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:15:42.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
