Real culprits should be punished,” said Ahmad.\nSartaj, another brother of the deceased, appealed that family members should be left alone as they do not want to meet any visitor.\nWith many leaders making a beeline to the village, District Magistrate NP Singh has restricted entry of politicians or others who could create ruckus.\nAsked about the visit of Som who addressed a public meeting yesterday and asked Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav to stop shedding “crocodile tears”, the District Magistrate said Som’s convey was stopped 1 km from the village and only the BJP leader and his security persons were allowed.\n“Whatever he spoke has been videographed. ..I have asked my legal expert to examine his statement....the statement he made in the village and the statement he made to the media persons. If any action is needed to be taken as per law, it will be taken,” the District Magistrate said.\nNobody will be allowed to flout rules, he stressed.\nThe District Magistrate has issued directions that prohibitory orders should be effectively implemented in the district and ought explanation from the ADM and SDM as to how people were allowed to assemble and hold meetings when Section 144 is in force.\nMeanwhile, Jarcha Police Station in-charge Subodh Kumar said police custody would be sought of accused Vishal and Shivam who are in 14-day judicial custody.\nDSP Anurag Singh said a home guard was questioned along with several others but his role in the episode was not yet confirmed.\nYesterday, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav met the family of 50-year-old Ikhlaq, who was lynched in Dadri over beef eating rumours, and assured them of justice.\nAkhilesh also announced financial assistance to the family totalling Rs.45 lakh.\n“I could not go to the village (Dadri) and so I felt it would be appropriate if I meet them here(Lucknow)...The family is in a state of shock. Nothing can make up for their loss. We can share their grief, but cannot erase the scene they witnessed,” he had said.\nIqlakh was dragged out of his home by a 200-strong mob and beaten to death after a public announcement from the local temple that the family had slaughtered a calf and eaten its meat on Monday night in Bishada village.\nCongress has attacked the BJP and the Narendra Modi government over the incident and said all progressive thinking people should stand up against it. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:18:39.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
