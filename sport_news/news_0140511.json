NASHVILLE, TN (WSMV) - \nThe Nashville Predators open up their season at home on Thursday against the Carolina Hurricanes. \nThe last time the Preds were on the ice in a real game was back on April 25 in the playoffs against the Chicago Blackhawks. \nBut that was then, and this is now. This is year two under coach Peter Laviolette. \nThe Preds re-signed some key players, such as Mike Fisher, Colin Wilson and Craig Smith. \nFingers crossed that Pekka Rinne can stay healthy all year. \nTop that off with some of the best defensemen in hockey, Shea Weber and Roman Josi, and they have a pretty good team. \nESPN.com hockey writer Scott Burnside has the Preds winning the Central Division. \n\"We always think that getting off to good start is important. Probably just go slow, right. Don't worry about the whole month - just worry about Thursday. Best thing for us. Our guys are ready to play. Carolina will be ready to play, too,\" Laviolette said. \nThe Channel 4 sports team will be downtown for the opening night in Smashville. Live reports will start on Channel 4 News at 4:00. \nCopyright 2015 WSMV (Meredith Corporation).
