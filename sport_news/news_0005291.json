(Gary Wiepert | The Associated Press) Comments \nOrchard Park, N.Y. — Rex Ryan isn't done defending the Buffalo Bills' defense. Even after a 34-21 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals in which the Bills allowed Andy Dalton to throw for three touchdowns, Ryan took issue with any hint that the defense has been underperforming in a three-game stretch of home games in which it has allowed 98 points. \n\"If you think we're poor on defense, then that's your opinion,\" Ryan said. \"I don't believe that for a second.\" \nRyan and the Bills spent the offseason talking about how good this defense could be. They all said the goal was to be the No. 1 defense in the league. At times, the Bills have looked the part. In other games, like Sunday against the Bengals, they haven't looked close to the defense they set out to be. \n\"You know and I thought defensively, especially scoring defense, that we'd be better,\" Ryan said. \"But I think I know where this team can go and I'm very confident that we'll get there.\" \nBut when? And what's going wrong? Here are a few things players mentioned in the locker room after the game. Pressure \nThe Buffalo Bills did not sack Andy Dalton and hit him just once, while the Bengals quarterback threw for three touchdowns and no interceptions. Dalton is known for getting the ball out quickly and using rhythm passes to make the most of his talented weapons on the field. Because of that, Ryan hardly dialed up any pressure. Mario Williams expressed some frustration with that fact after the game. \n\"When we got four guys rushing, we can do some things,\" Williams said. \"Some of the calls we had today, we just didn't have four guys out there rushing in certain situations, things like that. You just play the call. \n\"We don't make the calls as players. We've got to go out and execute whatever's called by any means. If it's three guys going, then it's three guys going, and we have to figure out a different way to get there faster on our part.\" \nRyan is known for being aggressive, and even he couldn't deny that he needed to bring more pressure to get to Dalton Sunday. \n\"I went with some three-man rush stuff and never let my guys go as much as I should have … I don't think our guys had enough shots on him, so we'll see. We gotta take a long, hard look at what we're asking our guys to do.\" \nEven Dalton said the Bills didn't blitz much for a Rex Ryan defense. That's when you start to wonder about the Bills' identity on defense. Communication \nEvery home game, it seems like the Bills are having issues communicating on defense. Linebacker Nigel Bradham again raised the issue after the loss to the Bengals \n\"Obviously it's loud on third down,\" Bradham said. \"We just have to get better with our hand signals. That's on us. We know that as a defense, especially playing here. It's going to be loud on third down. That's what we want. We just have to get everybody in the back end on the same page.\" \nWhen asked whether players don't know their assignment, Bradham said it's not a matter of picking up the scheme but just getting the calls out. \n\"I wouldn't say they wouldn't know,\" Bradham said. \"Sometimes things are different or some guy didn't get the call sometimes. \" \nEither Ryan has to simplify things, or players need to get on the same page. Penalties \nThe Bills now have 50 penalties in four home games after committing eight penalties against the Bengals for 93 yards. Once again, special teams were the main culprit. \n\"You know some of these other penalties we are getting a majority of them are on special teams, and I just don't understand it,\" Ryan said. \"I mean we talk about them over and over. And it is just … we had a facemask and you know sometimes that happens when you make a tackle. We got to really look at it and ask ourselves why. Like I don't understand how we can keep getting penalized.\" \nThose special teams penalties gave the Bengals advantageous field position for much of the first half and made life tough on the defense. Third down \nA year ago, the Bills never would have been getting gouged on third down they way they were Sunday. The Bengals converted seven of their 12 third-down attempts, including a few on third and long that kept the Bills' defense on the field. \n\"We have to get off the field on third down,\" Bradham said. \"We were close to No. 1 last year on third downs if we weren't No. 1. That's what we have to do. Get off the field. We have to figure out something and get that done. \" Red zone \nAfter shutting down the Titans in the red zone in Week 5, the Bills allowed the Bengals to score touchdowns on all four of their trips inside the 20-yard line. Bradham thinks back to last season, when the Bills were holding opponents under 20 points on a regular basis. \n\"Anything over 17 points, we can't have it,\" Bradham said. \"We have to play better as a defense. That's it.\" \nMost of these issues start to bleed into one another. Communication issues have all too often led to easy red zone points, such as Giovani Bernard's 17-yard touchdown run on which no Bills player was able to lay a hand on the Bengals running back. \n\"We have to finish,\" Bradham said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:58:30.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
