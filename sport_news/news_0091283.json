(AP) - This loss didn’t come in the final seconds like the others, but it was just as painful to Nebraska. \nTommy Armstrong Jr.’s two-point conversion pass that would have tied the game was tipped away, and the Cornhuskers couldn’t get the ball back before the clock ran out on a 30-28 loss to Northwestern on Saturday. \nNebraska (3-5, 1-3 Big Ten) has five losses by a total of 13 points in what is trending toward the program’s worst season since Bill Callahan’s 2007 team went 5-7. \n“We’ve got to make sure we keep grinding,” Armstrong Jr. said. “We can either give up or we can keep riding this season out and keep working together.” \nClayton Thorson’s 37-yard touchdown pass to Dan Vitale and Jack Mitchell’s third field goal gave the Wildcats (6-2, 2-2) an eight-point lead in the fourth quarter and they hung on to become bowl eligible for the first time since 2012. \nNebraska won on a Hail Mary the last time Northwestern visited Memorial Stadium. In the teams’ five meetings since the Huskers joined the Big Ten, four have been decided by three points or less. \n“Football is a crazy game,” Nebraska receiver Jordan Westerkamp said. “Lots of ups and downs. It’s kind of a roller coaster ride, and we’re on it right now in full force, but we’ll be OK.” \nThe Wildcats bounced back from consecutive losses of 38-0 to Michigan and 40-10 to Iowa. \nThorson passed for 177 yards and ran for a career-high 126. The Wildcats didn’t do a lot offensively early but led 17-12 at half. Thorson broke runs of 68 and 49 yards to set up scores, and Nick VanHoose returned an interception 72 yards for a touchdown. \nWe stuck together and found a way to make some plays in the first half and make it a game,” Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald said. “Great team win, huge team win to get us over the hump.” \nMitchell’s 27-yard field goal put Northwestern up 30-22, but the Huskers drove 75 yards in eight plays to pull within two points. Armstrong’s tipped two-point pass to Stanley Morgan Jr. fell incomplete, and Northwestern was able to run out the final 4:18. \nThe Huskers led 22-20 on Drew Brown’s 48-yard field goal to start the fourth quarter. \nNorthwestern went ahead with a long drive that saw Thorson convert a couple of third-down passes before he hit Vitale with a pass along the sideline for 37 yards. Vitale dived into the end zone, with the play withstanding a video review. \nAfter Nebraska went three-and-out, Mitchell kicked the field goal that put the Wildcats up by eight points. \nArmstrong hit Brandon Reilly for 37 yards on a fourth-and-6 before he ran in from 3 yards to make it a two-point game, but he couldn’t convert on the try for two points.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:27:16.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
