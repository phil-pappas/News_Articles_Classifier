Friday’s is the second straight game Porzingis will miss. He’s played just once at the Garden during the exhibition season.\n“I can’t wait to get back on the court,’’ Porzingis said. “Hopefully I’ll play on Saturday. I’m healthy and 100 percent.’’\nThe Knicks want Porzingis to start at power forward this season. The 7-foot-3 rookie seems mystified why he hasn’t been able to practice when healthy and is trying to convince himself the medical staff knows best .\n“It was perfect, no pain,’’ Porzingis said. “They just want to go slowly here, make sure I’m totally fine. They’re very cautious with me. I’m telling them every day: ‘I want to get back, want to get back.’ They’re taking care of me. They know what they’re doing. It’s their job.’’\nThe concern is Porzingis’ attempts to learn the triangle is being stifled. At the same time he is not getting a chance to adapt to the NBA’s physical play.\n“I’m on the sidelines watching the practices, staying focused the whole practice so I can remember the little details,’’ Porzingis said. “I’m staying mentally prepared for when I get on the court. Game speed is different. I’m trying to take as much information as I can. I’m telling them to help me with a few things and draw the plays. It’s different when you get on the court.’’\nWatching from the bench Monday against the 76ers wasn’t easy.\n“I’m obviously sitting, thinking I wished I could play,’’ Porzingis said. “That’s what was in my head.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:55:41.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
