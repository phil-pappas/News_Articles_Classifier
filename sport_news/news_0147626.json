PETERSBURG, FLA. - Mark Buehrle reached down deep to grind out his 15th win of the season Friday night.\nAnd the door may still be open for him to reach his annual goal of 200 innings for the 15th straight season.\nWith the help of a prolific Blue Jays offence, Buehrle worked into the seventh inning of an 8-4 win over the Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field. He left after 6.2 innings and has now pitched exactly 198 innings this season.\nManager John Gibbons has said as recently as last week that he might be moved to start Buehrle in Sunday’s final game of the season and have him get the necessary innings to give him 15 seasons of double-digits in wins and 200-plus innings.\nA number of factors might play into that decision.\nWill the Jays have home field advantage sewn up throughout the playoffs? Will Buehrle be able to crank up that 36-year-old arm on less than 48 hours rest? And will Buehrle himself want to slip through that side door to reach his goal?\nBuehrle, a one of a kind pitcher, has never been on the disabled list in his entire career. It’s been years since he hit 90 mph on any radar gun. In the past month, he has seldom topped 82 mph, yet he continues to get people out with guts and guile.\nHe fell behind 4-1 in this one but his trusty offence bailed him out, lashing 17 hits, six of them for extra bases, including two home runs and a pair of triples.\nWith two games remaining, the Jays have now scored 885 runs this season, nine short of the franchise record of 894 set in 2003.\nRyan Goins, Kevin Pillar and Russell Martin all drove in a pair of runs. Martin and Edwin Encarnacion both homered, while Goins and Chris Colabello tripled as the Jays lowered their magic number to finish first overall in the American League to two. Any combination of Toronto wins or Kansas City losses adding to two gives Toronto home field advantage throughout the playoffs.\nIn the early going, the Blue Jays had plenty of solid contact against Tampa starter Erasmo Ramirez but only managed a single run in the second inning. That was set up by back-to-back singles by Colabello and Martin. After Troy Tulowitzki lined out to right field, the runners advanced on a wild pitch by Ramirez. Pillar’s ground out to shortstop scored Colabello before the rally fizzled.\nBuehrle tricked the Rays through four innings, shutting them out on two singles, but it all came undone in the fifth. Richie Shaffer led off with a pop-up double into no-man’s land in right field. Goins gave chase but couldn’t make the play. Nick Franklin sacrificed Shaffer to third and he scored on catcher Luke Maile’s broken-bat single into left field.\nAfter Buehrle hit Brandon Guyer with a pitch, Mikie Mahtook put a charge in a 1-2 pitch from Buehrle, sending it deep into the left field stands for his eighth home run of the season. Three of them have been stroked off Buehrle in the last five days.\nThe Jays rebounded immediately to regain the lead with a four-run outburst, once again ignited by the bottom of the lineup.\nAfter Colabello struck out leading off, Martin and Tulowitzki both singled. Pillar drilled a double to left that scored Martin, chasing Ramirez from the game. Lefty reliever Enny Romero came on to face Goins, who drilled a triple over Mahtook’s head to clear the bases, tying the score. Toronto then took the lead on Revere’s sacrifice fly to right.\nThe Jays teed off on reliever Andrew Bellatti for three more runs in the seventh.\nEncarnacion got it started with his 37th homer, a shot to deep centre field. Colabello then hit a ball that would have gone out but it hit one of the catwalks in left field and he had to settle for a triple. After a video review, he remained on third base only long enough for Martin to hit his 23rd of the year into the leaft field seats to make it 8-4.\nAt that point, it became a question of how deep Buehrle could go in his final scheduled start of the season. He got the first out of the seventh, striking out Franklin. Then Maile scalded a ball into the gap in right-centre and Pillar laid flat out to make just another of those circus catches he’s becoming known for.\nBut when Buehrle hit Guyer for the third time in the game to bring Mahtook to the plate, Gibbons ruled with his head, not his heart, in pulling Buehrle from the game.\nMark Lowe came out of the bullpen to strike Mahtook out.\nMLB\nBlue\nBy Ken Fidlin , Toronto Sun First posted: Friday, October 02, 2015 10:29 PM EDT | Updated: Friday, October 02, 2015 10:34 PM EDT\nMark Buehrle reached down deep to grind out his 15th win of the season Friday night.\nAnd the door may still be open for him to reach his annual goal of 200 innings for the 15th straight season.\nWith the help of a prolific Blue Jays offence, Buehrle worked into the seventh inning of an 8-4 win over the Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field.
