He sees things sometimes before they actually happen, offensive coordinator Mark Mangino said at Jack Trice Stadium Saturday afternoon. \nBut to the gang of Warrens watching Saturday's 38-13 victory against Kansas back home in Oklahoma, it wasn't such a shock. They'd been seeing it for a long time — not so much Mike's 175 rushing yards, but the knack that helped him to do it. \n\"I actually started seeing some of that back when he was a kid playing little league football,\" Mike's father, Curtis, said in a phone interview after the game. \"He was a quarterback, and he always wanted to be like Michael Vick. \n\"You're always looking for the pass, but when you can sense that it's not going to be there, you tuck it in and run.\" \nFirst Big 12 season-opening win since 2002. Nine-game Big 12 losing streak kaput. Defense registers five sacks. Sam Richardson gets his first Big 12 win as a starter. Iowa State opens conference slate with win over Kansas \nThere were plenty of headlines for this one, but let's also not overlook the obvious: \nMike Warren is the best Iowa State running back since Alexander Robinson was dodging tacklers between 2007 and 2010. He might even be better, and yes, I know that's saying a lot, comparing a redshirt freshman to a guy who rushed for 1,195 yards in 2009, and 3,309 for his career. \nWarren, though, is that good, and I know, too, that he was running wild and free against Kansas, not Oklahoma, but that's all right. \nThis kid gets it. He sets up his blockers. He forces defenders one way, then quickly darts another. \n\"Even before he sees the guys in the front row, he already knows what the guys in the back row are going to do,\" coach Paul Rhoads said. \nWarren has learned all that despite just playing four college games. He's learned the nuances quicker than most before him at this school. \n\"It's patience,\" Warren said after helping his team to a 2-2 record heading to Saturday's game at Texas Tech. \"If you see a play, or anticipate a play — hit it going 100 miles an hour.\" Cyclones rushing star says he was taken off guard by his freshman rushing record. Randy Peterson/The Register \nThat's what he did before embarking on a 62-yard touchdown run with a couple minutes left in the third quarter. Warren knew where he was headed even before Richardson handed him the football. \n\"We have a pre-snap read,\" he told reporters after the 11 a.m. game. \"I read that the nose and the tackle were going to slant inside, so I knew I was going to go outside.\" \nTouchdown Cyclones.
