Very Up. Like a rocket up. Logano is two-for-two in Chase races in the second round , can smirk with comfort while racing next week in the tempest of Talladega and is building momentum like a very smart kid stacking blocks. \"We can obviously be proud of what we’ve done, but don’t just hang your hat on that,\" Logano said. \nDenny Hamlin: While his Joe Gibbs Racing teammates Matt Kenseth and Kyle Busch keep running into Chase roadblocks, Hamlin has been a charger in this round, finishing fourth at Charlotte and second at Kansas to sit rather peacefully in second place in points entering Talladega. He is one of seven drivers in the remaining dozen who own at least one win at Talladega. James: Joey Logano-Matt Kenseth clash shows Chase’s volatility \nKurt Busch: Busch has had a relatively quiet Chase, but he sits in third behind Logano and Hamlin entering Talladega. He had solid if not spectacular cars at Charlotte and Kansas, finishing fifth and sixth, respectively. He’s winless at Talladega. \nTHREE DOWN \nMatt Kenseth: For a guy who had really good cars at Charlotte and Kansas, Kenseth is in really bad shape. He was 12th — and last — in Chase points entering Kansas and left the Great Plains still in 12th. He’s in a must-win situation at Talladega, and that’s a nervous spot for any driver. Kenseth has won once there. James: Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s title hopes come down to Talladega \nDale Earnhardt Jr.: Junior is three spots out of qualifying for the third rounf of the Chase after a sour day at Kansas left him 21st, two laps down. If there’s a bright spot in this dark scenario, it’s that his last-chance race is at Talladega , where Earnhardts tend to shine. A win there would send the Earnhardt-heavy Talladega crowd into spasms of joy. \nKyle Busch: Will Busch’s seemingly annual Chase troubles continue? After rallying for a fifth-place finish Sunday, he’s one spot below the Chase cut-off line. Entering Talladega, he’s six points behind Martin Truex Jr. for the final third-round spot. Busch owns a win at the sport’s biggest track but has only five top-10 finishes in 20 races there. 2 CONNECT 18 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T16:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:23:23.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
