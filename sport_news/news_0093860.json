(Ben Nelms/The Canadian Press via AP) MANDATORY CREDIT more > By - Associated Press - 12:00 a.m., Monday, October 19, 2015 \nVANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) - Lauri Korpikoski scored on a breakaway at 1:46 of overtime to lift the Edmonton Oilers to a 2-1 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on Sunday night. \nNail Yakupov scored in regulation and Anders Nilsson stopped 33 shots to help Edmonton win for the second straight night after starting the season 0-4-0. \nMatt Bartkowski scored in regulation for Vancouver and Ryan Miller finished with 22 saves. \nThe Canucks had won eight of the previous 10 against the Oilers, including all five meetings last season. \nTied 1-1 after two periods, Canucks forward Daniel Sedin was left shaking his head early in the third after somehow chipping a puck that was lying in the crease over the Oilers’ goal with Nilsson down and out following a great stop on Henrik Sedin’s breakaway seconds earlier. \nNilsson then made a diving save on Radim Vrbata with less than seven minutes to go before Yakupov had a good chance on Miller with 90 seconds left in the third. \nEdmonton opened the scoring at 3:23 of the first period on the power play after some excellent work from rookie Connor McDavid. The No. 1 overall pick in June’s draft, who had two goals and an assist in the win at Calgary on Saturday, picked up the puck in the neutral zone and stepped around a check before feeding Yakupov for a one-timer that beat Miller from the slot. \nVancouver tied it with 4:17 left in the period when Bartkowski scored his first regular season goal in the NHL. Playing in his 138th game, the defenseman fired a shot from the point that nicked an Edmonton player on the way through and found its way past Nilsson. \nThe Canucks had plenty of chances to grab the lead in the second period. \nDaniel Sedin had two opportunities early before Brandon Sutter sent a backhand wide. Sven Baertschi then moved in alone on a breakaway after a big collision in the neutral zone, but Nilsson made a nice save. \nMiller had to be sharp at the other end with about eight minutes to go in the period, stopping Korpikoski on back-to-back opportunities from in close. \nNOTES: The Canucks squandered two power-play chances and fell to 1 for 20 with the man advantage this season. … Edmonton opens a three-game homestand Wednesday against Detroit. … Vancouver continues its five-game homestand Thursday against Washington. … Bartkowski’s only other goal came in Game 7 of the Boston Bruins’ memorable first-round series with Toronto in 2013. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:07:52.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
