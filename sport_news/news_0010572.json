Consider Gibbons and the Jays had just won back-to-back games on the road to get the series back to Toronto for the fifth and deciding game. \nBut the prevailing line of questioning post-game was the use of David Price in relief. That it came at the cost of a potential win for R.A. Dickey was also part of the post-game analysis. That between those two topics dominating Gibbons’ question and answer period with the media on a night when the Blue Jays erased the deficit in the series was shocking. \nSomehow lost in the middle of the two was the fact that the team won. But that didn’t seem to matter. \nGibbons was on the defensive from the outset and was visibly taken aback when that line of questioning stayed steady for the majority of his time on the podium. \nHe explained his side of things, suggesting he was managing to ensure a potential comeback by the Rangers would never get started and it was a win or go home game that insisted on that approach. \nYes, using Price on Monday night in all likelihood prevents him from being available in Game 5, but there is no Game 5 if the Jays don’t lock down Game 4. \nGibbons understood that and even with a 7-1 lead wasn’t about to leave any unspent bullets in the chamber. \nOn one hand GM Alex Anthopoulos understands why Gibbons decision to go with Price and by extension take a potential win away from R.A. Dickey got the reaction it did. It’s just what happens in the post-season. Every decision is second guessed and then third guessed. \n“Basically that was just Gibby’s welcome to the playoffs,” Anthopoulos said. “That’s what happens in the playoffs. I think it’s par for the course. Everyone is watching and to me everything becomes that much more magnified the longer you go in the playoffs. The crazy part is we won the game. I told him, ‘Imagine what would have happened if we had lost.’” \nAnthopoulos, though, has no qualms about spending Price in Game 4 because he trusts the man he has in charge of the team to make the right decisions. \n“From my standpoint his job was to win the game,” Anthopoulos said. “He won the game so I’m thrilled with the outcome. Look, regardless, if he had made the moves they (his critics) wanted him to make and he had lost, maybe no one would say anything. Maybe th ey would say, ‘Ah we just lost.’ \n“But we don’t need an ‘Atta boy’ moment, Anthopoulos said. “ That’s not what we need right now. We needed to win that game and that’s his job. You can be conservative so you don’t open yourself up to criticism, but that’s not what this is about. That’s why he is the right guy for this job — because he doesn’t concern himself with that.” \nIt’s not like this is the first time Gibbons has received criticism. He has been down this road countless times before with both media and the fan base. The timing of this one though is surprising. It comes just as the team he is responsible for shepherding has pulled itself off the mat and appears poised to deliver the knockout blow. \nGibbons didn’t like the post-game reaction but he likes where his team is heading into the deciding Game 5. \n“I’ve said all year, once I’ve gotten to know these guys, there’s something different about this group,” Gibbons said. “They don’t lack confidence. Our back was against the wall, it’s pretty obvious, but it’s never been a group that really ran from anything, backed down from anything. Yeah, those two games in Texas look a lot more like our team that we’ve seen all year, so hopefully that’s a good thing going into (Wednesday). But we’ve always been good at home. We didn’t win either of the first two, but we always expect to win here.” \nPeople can certainly argue the team could have got here without using Price. Yes, they could have, but no one can know for sure that they would have. What we know for sure is they are here with a chance to win the series. \nGibbons got them here doing it his way and regardless which way the game goes Wednesday, he will continue to do it his way. It’s why he has the job. \nSERIOUS LACK OF LEFTIES IN THE BULLPEN \nAn already significant hole in the Blue Jays bullpen may be even bigger for the fifth and deciding game of the ALDS. \nWith Brett Cecil out for the season with a torn left calf muscle, the Jays left-handed options in the pen were already down. \nPrior to Game 4, lefty specialist Aaron Loup became a late scratch as he headed home to tend to a family emergency. As of late Tuesday afternoon, manager John Gibbons was not sure whether he would be back in time for Game 5. \nWith David Price having thrown three innings in relief in Game 4, he is unlikely to be an option, although Price himself did say following the win Monday night in Arlington that he would be available to help if need be. \nGibbons doesn’t sound quite so optimistic. \n“I wouldn’t necessarily count on it,” Gibbons said. “You know, first, David is very instrumental in getting us here, but he’s not here to be abused, either. We’ll see, but don’t count on it.” \nReading between the lines, Gibbons would prefer not to use him if at all possible, but he has left the door open to do so if it becomes necessary. \nIn the best possible outcome, starter Marcus Stroman gives the Jays seven innings. Then they go to Aaron Sanchez in the eighth an Roberto Osuna for the ninth. \nBut without Price and without Loup if he does not make it back, the Jays are handcuffed when it comes to matching up with a tough left-handed bat late in the game if that situation arises. \nRyan Tepera, a right-hander and the guy who replaced Cecil on the ALDS roster when Cecil was declared out, does have some decent numbers against lefties. \nIn 51 at-bats versus lefties, Tepera has held opponents to a .137 batting average. On the negative side, all six of the walks he issued this year came against left-handed hitters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:26:48.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
