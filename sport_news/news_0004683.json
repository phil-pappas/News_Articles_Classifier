(Photo: Derick E. Hingle/USA TODAY Sports) \nThe arrival of Ben Simmons, Antonio Blakeney and Brandon Sampson has helped catapult the LSU Tigers into the top 25 of the men’s basketball preseason coaches’ poll at No. 19. \nKentucky and North Carolina tied for the top spot in the poll. \nLSU was 22-11 last season and reached the first round of the NCAA Tournament before losing to North Carolina State. The Tigers lost Jordan Mickey and Jarell Martin to the NBA off of that team. \nAmong the returnees who played prominent roles for LSU a year ago are Keith Hornsby, Tim Quarterman, Josh Gray and Jaylyn Patterson. \n“We know we have a long way to go,’’ LSU coach Johnny Jones said Wednesday. “The players know they’ve still got a big learning curve and they’re anxious to get better, but I think they’re looking forward to the challenges and really getting started.’’ \nVanderbilt is the only other SEC team ranked in the top 25. The Commodores are ranked No. 20. \nUSA Today Preseason Coaches Poll \nOct. 15, 2015 \nRank, Team (First-place Votes), 2014-15 Record, Points \nt1, Kentucky (11) 38-1, 749 \nt1, North Carolina (12) 26-12, 749 \n3, Maryland (5) 28-7, 723 \n4, Duke (3) 35-4, 686 \n5, Kansas (1) 27-9, 675 \n6, Virginia, 30-4, 667 \n7, Iowa St., 25-9, 541 \n8, Oklahoma, 24-11, 520", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:30:10.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
