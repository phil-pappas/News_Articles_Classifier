They know I’m pissed.”\nAfter throwing for 188 yards and one interception in Sunday’s 30-6 loss to the New England Patriots, Weeden was informed by the coaching staff on Tuesday that he would serve as Cassel’s backup in the Cowboys’ next game, Oct. 15 at the New York Giants.\nWeeden said he would handle the decision “as a pro,” not make excuses and not “throw a pity party for myself.”\nAsked if he was being made a scapegoat for an offense that has struggled on several levels, Weeden said, “You guys can dictate however you want to perceive it. I’m not going to comment on it. Like I said, I don’t want to bring the attention to me. I don’t want to say something I shouldn’t say. I’ve got my feelings. I’m going to keep them to myself and go from there.”\nFollow Eric Prisbell on Twitter @EricPrisbell\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfrFMz.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Reports", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf9aOX.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB4kwAp.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Why", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Is", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfrpr1.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AAjyO4&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Listen,", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA3kXQp.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Jay", "https://w.graphiq.com/w/i4DyivwPbc9?data-mcuid=7d00c4a52b&data-mccampaign=7152ec482e", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfr8wk.img&quot;}}", "http://feed.usatodaysmg.com/rss/msn/video/sports-usat-video&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Take", "http://twitter.com/EricPrisbell", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;football_nfl&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:36:37.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
