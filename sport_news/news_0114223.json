But, Rice more than made up for his absence when the Spartans played Echo Friday at Halfway. Rice scored six touchdowns — four rushing, one on a punt return, and one on an interception — intercepted four passes and ran for 256 yards all in 1 1/2 quarters. Those numbers helped Pine-Eagle roll past Echo 54-6 in a tuneup for the post season. Rice scored four TDs in the first quarter against the Cougars on runs of 51, 27 and 10 yards and a 79-yard punt return. He added a 75-yard TD run in the second quarter, and an 83-yard interception return in the third. Nathan McCall added three interceptions, and Trey Fisher 81 yards rushing. Fisher and quarterback Shane Denig each added a rushing touchdown. Pine-Eagle will host Jordan Valley at 2 p.m. Friday in the Old Oregon League playoffs. The winner advances to the Class 1A state playoffs. Pine-Eagle defeated the Mustangs 36-26 in the season opener for both teams in September.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T12:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:22:33.941+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
