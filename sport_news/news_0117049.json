He finished with 188 yards on 14 carries and the night seemed to get worse from there. \n\"We knew this was going to be real test for us [Friday],\" said Cass coach Scott Mannering of Central Catholic, ranked No. 1 in Class A. \"[Central Catholic] just don't make mistakes and give you a break. We got whipped in every phase of the game.\" \nThe backbreaker for Cass came right before the halftime when Central Catholic was already leading 32-0. The Kings surrendered two punt returns for touchdowns to Anthrop and the Knights. \nThe first one came with about two minutes left, when Anthrop spun out of a couple of tackles, set up his blocking in another instance and darted 55 yards for a touchdown, giving Central Catholic a 39-0 lead. \nCass, though, failed the run out the clock on its next possession and Central Catholic called a timeout with about 20 seconds left, forcing the Kings to punt. Knights' coach Kevin O'Shea said he was even surprised when Cass kicked a short put to Anthrop, who shook off tackles again en route to a 43-yard touchdown, with 11 seconds left, for a 46-0 lead. \nThe Kings' special teams also gave up a 75-yard kickoff return for a touchdown in the fourth quarter to the Knights Jordan Turpin after Drake Hall scored Cass' only touchdown of the night on a 41-yard run. \n\"I was really disappointed in our special teams giving them two scores on special teams,\" Mannering said. \"Then our young kids let them run a kickoff back at the end of the game. That's really disheartening. I thought we were really a lot stronger in that area.\" \nMannering said it seemed to be the pace of the Kings all night long. After getting two first downs in the first quarter, both on passes, Cass failed to get another first down against Central Catholic's defense until the fourth quarter. \n\"I thought we played really slow in certain aspects of the game,\" Mannering said. \"We couldn't get first downs and always gave them back the ball with good field position. As far as effort, I thought we played hard and gave our best, but we just came up awfully short [Friday].\" \nCass finished the game with 135 yards on the ground but the bulk of that came in the second half with the game was well out of reach. Mannering said he believed his team will bounce back after such a humbling loss. \nCentral Catholic finished the night with 285 yards on the ground and 417 yards of total offense against the Kings defense. That does not include the two punt returns and the kickoff returns for scores. \n\"[Tipton and Western] will see our score and get excited and think this is game they can win,\" Mannering said. \"We will receive their best play. We'll prepare and we will be ready to play and do well. How we respond may determine how well we do in the tournament as well.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:24:08.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
