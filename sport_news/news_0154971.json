I had my first losing week, going 3 - 5 - 1, dropping my winning percentage to 64%, helped considerably by Tennessee vomiting on themselves on a 4th and 14 play that cost me my under in the UT @ UF game. I held my own as I managed to get A&M at - 6.5 and won the ones that counted; however, the evidence shows a losing week so a losing week it was. \nWelcome to Week 5. A lot of awesome games out there if you play outside of the B1G. In fact, I don't believe there is a quality game being played in the B1G until late November; fortunately, there are plenty of other conferences playing real football including the SEC's marquee match-up of Bama @ UGA at 3:30 followed by the nightcap of Ole Miss @ Florida. My enjoyment of the later games will certainly be heavily impacted by the result of our game; however, big games bring sharp lines and I do not have a \"lock\" game as I have had in each of the first four-weeks. That's not to say there aren't opportunities...especially in the aforementioned B1G, but this is a really tough week to play against the lines. \nThis week also brings with it my first official blacklist. To make the blacklist, you need to be a terribly inconsistent, under-performing, Sybil-esque team. Welcome BYU, GT, Texas, Tennessee, Auburn, and Arkansas. \nLet's get to it: \nPURDUE @ MICHIGAN STATE: Purdue + 21.5 (2 out of 5 stars) \nMichigan State hasn't covered once this season. Oregon is garbage and people are jumping off the Michigan State bandwagon after jumping off the Oregon bandwagon, followed by the Tennessee bandwagon, followed by the Auburn bandwagon, followed by the USC bandwagon, followed by the Arkansas bandwagon, etc....you gotta love college football. Now, Michigan State is certainly not a bad football team, but I've stated since Week 1 that they aren't the same MSU teams we have seen the last couple of years. Like most teams in the B1G, they benefit greatly by a soft schedule and playing an Oregon team that would allow Boston College to score 48 points on them. Take all this into account and you won't find MSU ranked in the top 75 of either offense or DEFENSE...yep, you read that right. The only thing keeping me from making this a higher-rated pick is that Purdue is, well, Purdue. \nMINNESOTA @ NORTHWESTERN: Over 40.5 (2 out of 5 stars) \nI can't recall the last time I saw a total as low as this one. I'm sure they have been out there, but totals this low have gone the way of the dodo. 10 years ago, you would commonly find totals in the low to mid 30's, but the game has changed. To get a total this low, you need two teams that like ball control, running the clock, and play some defense. Well, here you go. With that being said, throw logic out the window. If you see a total below 42 in a ball game showcasing two competent football teams, you just play it. And even though NW was playing a scrub last week (Ball State was my 4-star pick last week, thank you very much), they still managed to put over 500 yards against them. Neither team is sexy, but they do have the ability to get the ball into the end zone. \nTEXAS A&M @ MISSISSIPPI STATE: Texas A&M - 6.5 (3 out of 5 stars) \nA&M didn't look like world-beaters last week against Arkansas...and frankly, they were a bit lucky to get out with the W...but games like these are the reason you take the team that struggled the week earlier. In today's age, gamblers tend to see a thrashing like the one A&M gave to Arizona State and expect to see the same thing week after week...it just doesn't happen. Arkansas was a team backed into the corner last week and A&M played them at a really bad time...but they got the W which is all that matters. As for Mississippi State, would you be surprised to know that Auburn out gained them when the two teams met? While certainly not a lock and not quite worthy of a four-star pick, this is my favorite line of the week. \nNORTHERN ILLINOIS @ CENTRAL MICHIGAN: Northern Illinois - 2.5 (3 out of 5 stars) \nOne of the worst thing to do when picking against spreads is taking road favorites and here I am doing it twice. Personally, I thought this line would be higher after Northern Illinois played Ohio State tough and then played a very good defensive team in Boston College. Still, Central Michigan isn't a pushover, but they also aren't the defensive juggernauts Northern Illinois has seen in recent weeks. Five straight MAC Title games coupled with the fact that Northern Illinois has played outstanding on the road really puts a bow on this game. What's keeping me from loving it more? The line is too low and this is another case of I don't know what I don't know. \nARKANSAS @ TENNESSEE: Under 54.5 (2 out of 5 stars) \nMaybe, just maybe, I wrote something earlier about teams on my blacklist. And maybe, just maybe, both Arkansas and Tennessee found their way onto it; however, my blacklist relates to spreads and not totals. You may think one denotes the other...and in many cases, if often does, but not here. Tennessee has managed to find ways to hit overs whether it be a game going to overtime or allowing a 63-yard TD on 4th and 14. It is mind-boggling. They are pretty much the anti-Auburn of 2013. But here is my case and point...Tennessee just isn't good at throwing the ball and is relying more and more on the run. Arkansas found its roots last week against A&M and ran the ball quite a bit more. What else did Arkansas do? They controlled the clock to the tune of 39 minutes plus. Can't say it was a winning formula (they lost), but it was by far the most successful the Razorbacks have been this year. I just can't see them moving away from it after having some success with it last week. \nOTHER NOTABLE GAMES AND 1-STAR PICKS: \nNOTRE DAME @ CLEMSON: Clemson - 1.5 \nCOLORADO STATE @ UTAH STATE: Colorado State + 4 \nOREGON @ COLORADO: Oregon - 7.5", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:18:23.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
