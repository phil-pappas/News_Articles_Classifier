In 2014, Sunrise Mountain allowed a whopping 48.5 points per game, and has cut that number in half to 24.1 points per game this season.\n“As far as our defense goes, it revolves around him,” Sawyers said. “He is the real deal. He is a special talent. A lot people are going to have him on their radar soon, so he won’t be a secret for long.”\nOn offense, the Miners got a big game from quarterback Stevie Wright.\nThe junior signal caller threw for 117 yards and two scores, and ran for 96 yards and two more touchdowns on the ground.\n“What he does with his legs makes our offense so dynamic,” Sawyers said. “He has grown up so much from last year, it is amazing. He is a consummate leader and keeps us steady when we get too high or too low.”\nKeeping his team from getting too high may become increasingly more difficult for Wright, as the Miners have a chance to clinch their first-ever playoff birth next week when they host struggling Del Sol.\nJesse Granger can be reached at 702-259-8814 or jesse.granger@lasvegassun.com .
