The file was sitting in a pile waiting to be processed and signed by a judge. { \"position1\" : { \"type\" : \"artist\", \"id\" : 34743, \"name\" : \"Kanye West\" } } \nThe judge granted Wasser's request and the file is now dead. \nKhloe filed for divorce in December 2013, but sat on it for a year and a half because she tried to save her marriage by trying to get Lamar into rehab. She finally gave up this summer. \nAs TMZ reported, Khloe privately vowed to be by Lamar's side during his recovery, which will take months, and a few days ago they both agreed to give their marriage another chance. They both signed the document Wasser presented to the judge, asking that the divorce case be dismissed. \nPhoto: Getty Images", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:09:07.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
