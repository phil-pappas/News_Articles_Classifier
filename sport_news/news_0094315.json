They also feel good about Syndergaard pitching at home, where he’s been most successful. \n“We thought that’s a good mix,” Collins said, adding Harvey could be available out of the bullpen in a potential Game 7. \nNo matter which starter is on the mound for the Mets, one thing is certain: He throws hard. \nNew York delivered 5,752 pitches clocked at 95 mph or better this season, by far the most in the majors, according to STATS. (The Royals were second at 4,315). \nThat makes for an intriguing matchup against a Kansas City lineup that struck out the fewest times of any team in the regular season and had the highest contact rate in the big leagues. \nRoyals batters hit a major league-best .300 on heaters 95 mph or faster, STATS said. \n“We’re not going to change the way we go about things. We’ve still got to pitch to our strengths and our strength is power,” Collins said. \n“I still think we’ll strike some people out because our guys have got good stuff.” \nHarvey shut down the Chicago Cubs in the NL Championship Series opener and won both his playoff starts. \nLast season’s NL Rookie of the Year, deGrom is 3-0 with a 1.80 ERA in three postseason outings. \nSyndergaard, the hardest thrower of the group with a fastball that tops out around 99-100 mph, is 1-1 with a 2.77 ERA in three games — including his first career relief appearance.
