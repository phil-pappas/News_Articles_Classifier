It's just very touching,\" Long added.\nThe American Cancer Society's Making Strides Against Breast Cancer raises much-needed money for support services and ground-breaking research for patients like Ashley Linder's aunt.\n\"My aunt was diagnosed with cancer just a couple of weeks ago and had surgery for the first time,\" Linder said.\nEveryone here, it seemed, had a person to support and a reason to come.\nAn estimated 14,000 people turned out for today's event.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
