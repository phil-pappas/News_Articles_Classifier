So it was out of the blue.” \nDunk’s 6-1 win over Swift was the start of a dominant CdM singles showing. Dunk and Danielle Willson each went 2-0, and Siena Sharf went 1-1 as the Sea Kings (15-1) won five of the day’s six individual sets with no score line being closer than 6-1. \nDana Hills (10-4), ranked sixth in the county, went 5-1 in doubles, but was unable to match the the Sea Kings’ convincing score lines. \n“Our girls played well, came out a little slow in the second round today, but they fought back, had a great final round,” Dolphins coach Justin Green said. “Our doubles is clearly our strength, and I feel like all of our doubles teams are pretty equal. We were just one set away.” \nWith all the singles sets in the books, the Dolphins trailed, 9-6, in the final round. Dana’s doubles teams swept the third round, as Dana Mackensen and Jacklyn Melkonian notched a 6-4 win over CdM’s top duo of Camellia Edalat and Erica Chen . \nThe Sea Kings have reeled off 12 consecutive wins since its lone loss to Peninsula. Six of their 15 wins have come against CIF-SS top-10 ranked opponents. \nContact the writer: kconnolly@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:20:07.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
