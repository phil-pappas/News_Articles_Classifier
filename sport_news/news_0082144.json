(Photo: Phil Velasquez, AP)\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE CHICAGO — Harry Caray had a cheat sheet — and yet he still mispronounced the names of Chicago Cubs players.\nSo says Steve Stone, who for 14 seasons served as the color commentator alongside Caray, the legendary Cubs’ play-by-play announcer. With the Cubs chasing their first World Series title since 1908, Stone talked about the widespread notion that his fellow broadcaster was as error-prone as the once-forlorn Cubs.\nTrying to help out, Stone said he took Caray’s score book and phonetically spelled out names of Cubs players such as catcher Hector Villanueva. And then in the first inning of Villanueva’s debut, Stone said, he watched Caray pronounce the catcher’s name seven different ways — none properly.\nUSA TODAY\nDid Harry Caray really drink all those beers?\n“He knew if he stumbled over the names, it was funny,’’ Stone told USA TODAY Sports. “Everybody would say, ‘Well, that’s just Harry.' And they would tune in to see which name he was going to mangle next.\"\nIt was Stone who had the college degree — in history and government from Kent State — but Caray who provided the “local broadcast” education.\n’’When God decided there should be a baseball broadcaster, he created Vin Scully,’’ Stone said, referring to the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Hall of Fame announcer. “But the greatest salesman of the game of baseball, the city of Chicago, Wrigley Field, the Chicago Cubs and himself — not necessarily in that order — was Harry Caray.\n“One of the things Harry taught me was how to talk to the fans on a daily basis where they believed you were absolutely one of them.\"\nStone, who now does color commentating for the Chicago White Sox, said one of his favorite Harry Caray stories is one Harry Caray liked to tell about himself.\nIt was 1968, and Caray was the play-by-play announcer for the St. Louis Cardinals when he was hit by a car. Up until the day of the season opener, the team had left it unclear to fans about whether Caray would be ready to call the team’s first game.\nOn the day of the opener, after the players were announced, the PA announcer called out the name of one more more — Harry Caray.\nOut of the dugout, he hobbled on two crutches toward a microphone. Suddenly, to the crowd’s delight, Caray threw one crutch to the side and kept hobbling. Then, eliciting a roar from the crowd, he tossed aside the other crutch, grabbed the mic and announced it was time to play ball.\nSaid Stone, “As Harry puts the mic down, (pitcher) Bob Gibson comes over to him and says, ‘What’s with the crutches?’ And Harry looked at him and said, ‘It’s show business, Gibby. It’s show business, Gibby.’ ”\n“Harry knew it was showbiz. He knew from the beginning.\"\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RTMfg3&text=Truth%20about%20Harry%20Caray%3A%20It%20was%20show%20business&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RTMfg3&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635808843230554791-cxx-stone-20.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4193fe516033b7747b0896541d59552730d1d445/r=500x354/local/-/media/2015/10/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635808843230554791-cxx-stone-20.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/64b3b07d6ac8c543413792ca81247cf0f3153bd4/c=0-100-1391-886&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/10/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635808713564968433-C03-OPENER-08.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/FNn-_FU-kiw", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/336fe17e595d47c08d1232ae8e971b73c70c077d/c=64-0-2163-1578&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/635808843230554791-cxx-stone-20.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-20T15:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:43:23.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
