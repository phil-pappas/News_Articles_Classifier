However, according to Grier's dad, the flu won't keep him off the field. \n\nTalked to Will Grier's dad. He said no way the flu is keeping his son off the field.\n— Pat Dooley (@pat_dooley) October 2, 2015 The flu, specifically, might not, but the coaching staff could hold him out if he's not well enough. If that were the case, Treon Harris -- back this week from a one-week suspension -- would be back in the starting role after Grier took that from him in Week 2. \nThis entire situation is less than ideal for Florida, which will either have to start Grier coming off of an illness or Harris, who was just suspended for a week, against an Ole Miss defense that is one of the toughest in the country. Will Grier's status is reportedly uncertain due to illness.
