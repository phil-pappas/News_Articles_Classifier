Surely there are better ways of protecting livestock than allowing large portions of the state to engage in the equivalent of English fox hunting.\nDespite a voter-approved ban of this practice, the editorial board points to the state Legislature's recent \"flexibility\" regarding new laws about recreational marijuana and argues that if some counties are getting a pass on pot laws, other counties should get a pass on the dog-hunting ban. The editorial board is right: The Legislature should not have let various counties opt out of the new marijuana laws, for precisely the reason that it opens the door to mischief proposals like this one.\nThe fact that a majority of counties opposed the dog-hunting ban is irrelevant, unless the state has somehow shifted to a \"one-county, one-vote\" system of governance. The editorial board observes that \"Oregon's center of political power is decidedly urban,\" which is another way of saying that Oregon is a democracy — and a reasonably functional one at that.\nKelly Bulkeley\nSouthwest Portland\n•\nHunting cougars with dogs: The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board's support for an increased cougar kill quota — and the barbaric practice of hunting them with dogs — is cruel, unnecessary and ineffective. Cougars do not pose a serious threat to people. In all of North America, 24 people have been killed by cougars — over the past 125 years. Conversely, about 100 people die every single year in hunting accidents. Fewer than 0.25 percent of cattle and 4 percent of sheep are killed by predators. The vast majority that don't make it to the slaughterhouse die from health problems and exposure to weather.\nThe truth is, people kill cougars for two reasons: Hunters want more deer and elk for themselves, and it's obviously big fun for them. But deer and elk populations are thriving throughout most of Oregon. As for the fun part, I guess it must be very enjoyable to sit in the safety of a vehicle while radio-collared dogs chase a terrified cougar up a tree. Then you can just saunter up to the tree and shoot the cat.\nHuman beings have a long and ugly history of slaughtering anything we don't understand, that gets in our way or is considered a \"nuisance.\" Oregonians can and should do better, and the editorial board should know better.\nBeatrice Shapiro\nSilverton\n•\nHunting cougars with dogs: The editorial board makes an insulting, erroneous suggestion that all Oregonians on the east side of the mountains are in favor of hunting cougars with dogs. By painting our state into this ridiculously simplistic divide, the board could not be more wrong.\nThe east side of the mountains includes people who care about the humane management of wildlife, hunters who recognize that using hounds to hunt animals is a cruel, outdated bloodsport, and citizens and scientists who recognize that our state's cougar population is a necessary part of eco-management.\nUsing dogs to chase, attack and tree cougars is brutal bloodsport that results in orphaned kittens, violent risk of injury and death to the dogs, and erratic migration patterns for surviving cougars.\nThe editorial conveniently leaves out who wants to pursue hunting cougars with hounds — and why. There's no need for cougar hunting with hounds, but trophy hunters — who do not have Oregon's best interests at heart, only their own — are pushing for this. (The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife proposes allowing trophy hunters and wildlife service agents to kill an unlimited number of cougars that live within 6,200 square miles of designated \"target areas,\" but their reasons ignore scientific facts.)\nLet's get the truth out about cougars, about hunting with hounds and about the population east of the mountains.\nJessi Princiotto\nBend", "external_links": ["http://www.humanesociety.org/news/news_briefs/2015/10/odfw-cougar-hunting-101515.html?credit=web_id85541291", "http://www.predatordefense.org/cougars.htm", "http://www.wildearthguardians.org/site/PageServer?pagename=priorities_wildlife_war_wildlife_livestock_losses#.ViqASbT_85s"], "published": "2015-10-25T13:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:19:11.583+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
