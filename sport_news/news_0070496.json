She’ll join the Mavericks in the fall of 2017. \n“Definitely, after I visited there, that sealed the deal,” said the 6-foot-1 middle hitter. “The athletic family — the staff, the girls — everybody was so nice. It felt like home.” \nUpon her arrival, Sade will be the third Metro player on the Mavericks’ roster. Kayla Torson, a 2015 Cedar Rapids Xavier graduate, is a freshman there. Cedar Rapids Kennedy’s Macy Anderson selected UNO before the season and will play there next year. \nSoutheast Missouri State and Bradley were Sade’s other visits. \nSade leads the Indians (16-3) — ranked No. 2 in Class 4A — with 2.94 kills per set and owns a .361 kill efficiency. Her 52 blocks also pace the team. \nShe intends to major in social work. \n“I’m just excited to play at the next level and see what the future holds,” she said. \nl Comments: (319) 368-8857; jeff.linder@thegazette.com Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:48:51.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
