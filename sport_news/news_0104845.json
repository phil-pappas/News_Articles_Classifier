The Silver Streaks competed the tournament with a two-day score of 689 finishing 113 strokes over par. “I think we played well. We battled the conditions both days pretty good,” Galesburg coach Brad Gross said. “The wind and the weather wasn’t easy for the girls out there.” Hinsdale Central won the title with a two-day 617. Loyola Academy shot 635 for second and Wheaton Warrenville South was third with a 640. Taylor Nesselroad finished the day with a six-over-par 78 and a two-day score of 154 to lead Galesburg. Nesselroad’s score put her in a three-way tie for ninth-place. “She had her ups and downs. She stayed focused,” Gross said of Nesselroad. “It could have easily went the other way for her. She had a few holes that gave her some trouble but she got medalist. She got low score at state and beat her own score by one stroke from two years ago.” The Streaks’ Kirsten Osborn shot an 87 on Saturday for a total of 173 for 59th place, Jenna Heck carded and 86 to finish with 177 for 71st place and Jessica Sparks had a 95 for a two-day tally of 185 finishing in 87th. “That’s our 28th time going to state, the lowest team score at state so it was a pretty good finish,” Gross said. “We were the top downstate school when you get away from the Chicago suburbs which is pretty incredible itself. It was definitely a memorable weekend for Galesburg girls golf. Taylor was the first to get a medal in 18 years.” Madasyn Pettersen (Rockford Guilford) won the individual title with an even par 144. In the boys Class 2A State Tournament, Galesburg’s Noah Benbow finished in a four-way tie for seventh-place after shooting a 150 over the two days at Illinois State University’s Weibring Golf Club in Normal. Benbow finished Saturday’s 18 rounds with a 76. The Streaks’ Sean Peterson carded an 87 on the second day of competition to finish with a 175 for 87th place.
