Western Big 6 Galesburg’s defense has posted back-to-back shutouts and will be the key once again when the Silver Streaks take on Rock Island. Rock Island has scored 34, 30, and 61 points in its three victories this season, just 10, 18, and 16 in three losses. If Galesburg can hold the Rocks under 20 that should bode well for a victory, one that would guarantee at least a share of the WB6 title. A Galesburg loss brings no less than three teams back into the title picture and would put the Streaks’ postseason hopes in flux with a difficult road trip to Quincy set for next week. Alleman needs to win out to become playoff eligible and the first step for the Pioneers is a home game with WB6 surprise Moline. West Central One play. That’s all that separates Macomb from being 4-2 and one upset of Quincy Notre Dame away from not only a playoff berth, but a West Central title. Instead West Hancock found the endzone at the last second to hand the Bombers a loss dropping them to 3-3. Macomb needs to win two of three games against QND, Breese Mater Dei and Bloomington Central Catholic, a daunting task down the stretch. Monmouth-Roseville also needs to win two of its last three to make the playoffs but the Titans are coming out of Week 6 on a much higher note. A 40-8 win over Illini West was a huge confidence booster in anticipation of a homecoming game with West Hancock. Prairieland Black Rushville-Industry and South Fulton getting beat by Lewistown and North Fulton respectively has thrown a wrench into the conference title race. Being the recognized conference rep by the IHSA is huge for teams that might only finish with five wins and fall short of qualifying on playoff points. The simplest scenario plays out if the Rockets beat the Rebels this week, that would give R-I an outright title. If South Fulton wins break out the calculators as it would likely come down to the points given up in games amongst the teams with tied conference records. Abingdon-Avon, North Fulton, Peoria Heights and even Rushville-Industry with a loss are still mathematically alive for the automatic playoff bid. Prairieland Blue The matchup has been looming ever since Farmington took care of Knoxville in Week 4 and now fans will finally be able to see the Farmers take on Elmwood/Brimfield for all the marbles in the Prairieland Blue. The Trojans have not had a serious challenge since Week 2 when they lost to Annawan/Wethersfield while the Farmers most recently found themselves able to escape an upset bid by Bushnell/West Prairie. While 3-3 Knoxville projects to have some leeway when it comes to playoff points the Blue Bullets are focused on closing the season with three wins to get an automatic bid. It starts with senior night against BWP before road trips to South Fulton and Abingdon-Avon. Page 2 of 2 - Three Rivers Mississippi Princeton continues to be the surprise of the year as the Tigers doubled their 2014 win count by shutting out Sterling Newman Catholic to get to 6-0. The season finishes with three home games so a conference title is now more tangible than ever. Games with St. Bede Academy and Erie/Prophetstown aren’t sure things however. Once again Kewanee was valiant in a loss but Hall's explosion of offense in the second half last week was too much for the Boilers to handle. One more loss and Kewanee will be eliminated from playoff eligibility. Three Rivers Rock No new developments in the conference race which still figures to be Orion’s to lose. Down toward the playoff bubble Bureau Valley has put up some gaudy offensive numbers in recent weeks to get back to .500 at 3-3. The Storm look perfectly capable of winning out to get an autobid for the playoffs. Like Bureau Valley each of Rockridge’s final three opponents currently have a losing record and the Rockets should also be able to clinch a spot in the postseason. Lincoln Trail The Lincoln Trail continues to pump out quality games and this week should be no different. United heads to Galva to take on Mid-County while Princeville looks to bounce back from its first loss of the season on the road against Annawan/Wethersfield. A Princeville victory over the Titans would mark the third straight week a previously unbeaten LTC team notches a win on the road coming off its first loss. Stark County makes its longest road trip of the season to take on West Central with contests against United and Princeville looming at the end of the schedule.
