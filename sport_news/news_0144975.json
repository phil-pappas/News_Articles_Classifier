Posted: Wednesday, October 7, 2015 6:00 pm \nGAINESVILLE — Even though he thoroughly researched his decision, Jonathan Bullard still found himself facing some unknowns once he made the call last January to turn down the NFL money and return for his senior season at Florida. \nWould he relate to the new head coach and a new defensive coordinator? \nHow would he fit into a new scheme? \nWould the new staff want him to play defensive tackle or end? \nWho would be his defensive line coach? \nAll unknowns. \nBut only a few weeks after making his decision, Bullard started getting affirmation that it was the right one. It began with Jim McElwain hiring Chris Rumph away from Texas to be the Gators’ defensive line coach. \nBullard already knew his new line coach, knew him well. \n“Coach Rumph’s was the first camp I ever went to when he was at Clemson,” Bullard said. “He moved to Alabama and they offered me and I visited there. He went to Texas, then he ended up here. \n“I already knew his wife and a lot about him. He came in and right away, it wasn’t a relationship that had to be built because we already knew each other. He knew my family, I knew his. We knew little things about each other. \n“We just got off to a great start.” \nAnd things have only gotten better from there. \nIn the spring, McElwain and Rumph encouraged the soft-spoken Bullard to become a leader — and he has, especially among the young defensive line group. \nIn the summer, the coaches told him to prepare to play both end and tackle — and he did. \nThis fall, they’re asking him to be a dominant and disruptive defender — and he is. \n“That guy, you talk about not only a positive effect based on how he practices, but how he plays,” McElwain said Wednesday. “His leadership within that group and on that defense (is big). He’s a guy that’s got an unbelievable first step. He’s a disruptive force. \n“And he’s very unselfish. How many defensive linemen say, ‘Can I play on the interior?’ He knows what he has around him to be successful. That speaks volumes for how he understands how he can help this football team be successful.” \nAt first a reluctant tackle, Bullard now embraces the position. He’s comfortable inside, he said, and this is where many of his disruptive plays (sacks and tackles for loss) are coming from. \n“I’m pretty quick on the inside. I can disrupt,” Bullard said. “It’s easier to disrupt from the inside than the outside. On the inside, you can just pin your ears back and go. And read blocks. (Offensive linemen) pull a lot and you can make quick movements to get around them and just be disruptive. \n“I started outside (at end) last week (against Ole Miss). It’s week to week. I never know where I’m going to end up until that Thursday. Either way, wherever they put me, I’m going to go out and do my best. The coaches are going to put me in the right position to win.” \nRumph said Bullard seemed almost disappointed last Thursday when he informed him he’d be starting at end against the Rebels. Rumph assured Bullard he’d also play some tackle. \n“What he’s done to embrace that role (as a tackle) is unbelievable,” R umph said. “It’s very rare. People don’t realize the sacrifice that that guy made, and made without hesitation. \n“Here’s a guy that could have left early at the defensive end position. He comes to his senior year, he has new coaches. Not only does he have new coaches, he has to learn a new system. Now this staff is asking him, ‘Hey, guy, I think you can play defensive tackle.’ \n“Defensive end, it’s sexy to those guys. It sounds cool, defensive end, I’m rushing off the edge. Defensive tackle is not a real sexy position.” \nWhether he’s at tackle or the sexy position, the consensus among the UF coaches and players is that Bullard is playing the best football of his career. \nBullard agrees. \n“I think I am,” he said. “I think I’m just in the right spots. I credit it to watching more film and growing up a little more, buying in and working hard and understanding that this is my last year. It’s all or nothing. \n“I’ve got high goals for myself. I want to go out and put great film out and see where it leads me.” \nAnother one of his goals is to win — and Bullard and the Gators are doing that, off to a 5-0 start and No. 11 national ranking. \nWith that undefeated start, Bullard said Atlanta, and the SEC Championship Game, is now a realistic goal for the Gators. \n“Coach Mac came in and we talked about wanting to win,” he said. “We have the guys in the room to win. We’re not looking ahead that far, but it’s always in your mind, to make it to Atlanta and the College Football Playoff. I think we’re capable of doing it. \n“We believe in the offense and the offense believes in us. I just think there’s a good vibe right now.” \nRegardless how the rest of the season plays out, Bullard is firm in his belief that he made the right decision to return for his senior season. \n“I’m happy with the decision I made,” he said. “I think I’ve helped myself a little so far. It’s still a long season to go. \n“It wasn’t time for me to come out. I still had things I had to prove to myself, and for the University of Florida. I wanted to be a part of something special here. The first three years were OK, but not what we really wanted around here. Now, we have a chance to do something special.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:46:01.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
