The Panthers are also .500 in region play at 1-1. \nTheir current status in Region 3-6A makes this Friday's showdown with region foe Brandon (6-1, 2-0 in 3-6A) all the more critical. The Panthers host the Bulldogs for a game that carries serious weight for Petal's postseason hopes. \nThe Panthers' ambitions are very much alive and well, despite the loss to their rival last week. \n\"Our kids have really come out this week after the loss to Oak Grove and seem to be focused,\" Petal head coach Marcus Boyles said. \"Obviously, that was a big loss for us — a rivalry game and a division game. I've been pleased with the maturity and leadership of our kids.\" \nAmong the leaders in the Panthers' efforts to push past last week's loss will be junior running back Stephon Huderson — who rushed for 200 yards and a touchdown against the Warriors — as well as senior cornerback Tyrek Moody. \nThe Panthers' ability to bounce back this week will be crucial heading into their tilt against the Bulldogs. Brandon brings a number of challenges to the table for Petal, not the least of which is a versatile defensive attack that could give the Panthers fits. \nTo that end, Boyles pointed to his squad's offensive line as the key difference-making unit for the contest. \n\"Brandon is going to bring a lot of different blitzes, a lot of different looks,\" he said. \"So it's going to be real critical to recognize it and pick those blitzes up to get us either running lanes or time to throw the football.\" \nPetal's defense will need to bring its A-game as well. The Panthers will have their hands full containing Brandon's versatile run game. \n\"They want to establish the run,\" Boyles said. \"They've got some speed backs. They want to get it to the corner, get it to the edge. So we've got to do a good job of protecting the corner, because those guys can really run. If they get the edge on our defense, those can become big plays, so we've got to do a good job there.\" \nKey to limiting the Bulldogs' ground game will be containing them through the air, especially the big-play potential of senior Bulldog wide receiver Kiantae Payton. Preventing the big gains in the passing game will help Petal force Brandon's offense to be one-dimensional. \n\"That's the plan,\" Boyles said. \"(Our) outside linebackers have got to do a good job of fighting off blocks and turning (Brandon's running backs) back inside to our pursuit.\" Pink-Out Game \nFriday night's contest against Brandon has been tabbed a Pink-Out Game. Fans are encouraged to wear pink to the game in recognition and support of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. 2 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://hatne.ws/1RuzBDU TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:43:51.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
