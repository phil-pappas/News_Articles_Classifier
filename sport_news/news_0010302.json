That quest will begin today when the Lady Chiefs host Northside-Columbus in a first-round match of the Class state playoffs. Staff photo by Kathryn Ingall slideshow Defending Class state champion Sequoyah headlines a group of four county volleyball teams that will begin the playoffs tonight.Joining the Lady Chiefs in the Class bracket is River Ridge, while Etowah and Woodstock are in contention for the Class title.After finishing second to Cambridge in the Area 7 tournament, Sequoyah will begin its title defense by hosting Northside-Columbus today. Coach John Edwards said his team is not playing its best volleyball, but having the home-court advantage should help.“We started playing better towards the end of the season, but, honestly, I’ve seen us play better for stretches before,” Edwards said. “I think the girls will be excited to play at home and the energy will be great. I think we still have our best volleyball this season to come.”In addition to playing at home, Sequoyah also has the experience of taking home the top prize. Led by seniors Kelley Hartman and Lauren Hartman and sophomores Mallory Lawson, Deja Gross and Annika Lanning, the Lady Chiefs brought back a core of players who experienced winning the 2014 championship.“I think it’s a huge advantage that we’ve been here before,” Edwards said. “Girls are definitely going to feel more comfortable talking to a teammate than a coach, so having those girls in the locker room, before and after matches, and even during huddles when I’m not there, really helps. They can get the other girls ready and show them how to win.” Also coming off a deep playoff run last season is third-seeded River Ridge. The Lady Knights made it to the semifinals last year before falling to Sequoyah.“We have the same goal we have every year,” coach Julie Winfield said. “We want to get to the elite eight, the final four and to the championship. We were close last year, but now it’s time to take that next step and finish the job.”River Ridge, led by seniors Brittany Castro, Katie Popp and Leonor Nickell, will begin its playoff run with a visit to Harris County.Also going on the road is Etowah, which finished as the fifth seed from Area 5 . The Lady Eagles will have to begin their tournament with a trip to play Brookwood, but coach Kim Robertson is not concerned with her team’s seed.“It all comes down to the luck of the draw, and I think we can match up with the teams in our bracket,” she said. “We have a lot of seniors, which is to our benefit. We’ve also played a lot of these teams already, so we’ll be ready. That’s why we play those matches during the season.”The Lady Eagles’ playoff push will be powered by three record-breaking seniors — career digs leader Madeline Gilmer (1,359), kills leader Natalie Lucco (1,091), and assists leader Sydney Hotaling (2,389) — who feel they have one more thing to do. “To win a state championship would mean everything,” Gilmer said. “It was just be a great way to end all the work and time that we’ve put in over the years.”Also emerging from the Area 5 tournament was fourth-seeded Woodstock, which will travel to Mountain View in its first-round matchup.Although they struggled at times during the season, the Lady Wolverines righted the ship at the right time and played well in the area tournament.“We changed some things around, and the girls really responded,” coach Anita Dodd said. “We’ve approached every match we’ve played over the last couple of weeks as if they were all playoff matches. There is no more losing to a team and saying it’s OK, because it’s win-or-go-home time now.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:05:11.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
