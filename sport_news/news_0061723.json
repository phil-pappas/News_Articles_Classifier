His manager said that this might have been a career-ending situation for Jones, and it was unclear if a return to the octagon was at all in his future.\nBut after a six-month suspension, the UFC has lifted its ban effective immediately. Although UFC Chairman and CEO Lorenzo Fertitta made it clear that this may be his one and only second chance.\n\"We've made it clear to Jon that this new opportunity to compete in UFC is a privilege and not a right, and that there are significant expectations we have regarding his conduct moving forward,\" Fertitta told TMZ Sports .\n\"Weâ€™re happy to read and see reports that he has embraced the terms of his plea agreement and is using this experience to grow and develop as a person.\"\nJones released a statement on Facebook which seems to indicate he understands the gravity of his past mistakes.\nI am grateful for the opportunity to resume my career and I am excited to show how much I've grown as a person outside of the octagon. It took me losing almost everything I had worked for to realize how much I had. I am blessed and humbled by the continued support of the MMA community and I can't thank my fans enough for their unwavering support through my ups and downs. This marks the beginning of a new chapter in my life and my career and let me assure you, the best is yet to come.\nIt's unclear how soon Jones will return to action, but if this video of him deadlifting 525 pounds from a few weeks ago is any indication, he may not need a ton of time to train before participating in his next fight.\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/Jonbones.Jones/posts/805848899525323", "http://www.tmz.com/2015/10/23/jon-jones-reinstated-by-ufc/"], "published": "2015-10-23T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:26:42.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
