The decision seemingly ends Platini's bid to succeed Blatter as FIFA president in the emergency election in February. \nAnother presidential hopeful, Chung Mong-joon, was suspended for six years in a separate case and FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke was banned for 90 days. \nThe suspensions can be extended by up to 45 days. \nIssa Hayatou, the longtime head of the African soccer confederation who was reprimanded in 2011 by the International Olympic Committee in a FIFA kickbacks scandal, will take over as acting president. \nThe Cameroonian, who has a serious kidney illness that requires regular dialysis sessions, is currently in Yaounde and is expected to travel to Zurich immediately. \nHayatou said he would not stand for president but remained committed to the reform process. \n\"We will also continue to cooperate fully with authorities and follow the internal investigation wherever it leads,\" Hayatou said in a statement. \nThe interim leader of UEFA will be Spanish federation head Angel Maria Villar, who remains at risk of being sanctioned from the FIFA ethics committee in its investigation of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding contests. \nBlatter's suspension brings a sudden halt to a 40-year career that had survived waves of scandals until he was placed under criminal investigation. \nLast month, Swiss authorities turned up at Blatter's office at FIFA headquarters and interrogated him. The criminal case centers on Blatter allegedly misusing FIFA money by making a US$2 million payment to Platini, who was questioned as a witness.
