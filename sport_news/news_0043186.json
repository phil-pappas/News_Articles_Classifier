The favorite in 2015-16 with seven of 10 first-place votes is College of Idaho, which won its second straight CCC regular-season and tournament titles last season but has to replace four starters and six of its top-seven scorers. Northwest Christian received three first-place votes and is second in the poll, followed by Warner Pacific — which also lost four starters from its CCC co-championship team — and Oregon Tech. After making a run to the CCC tournament championship game and winning twice at the NAIA Div. II tournament, SOU was No. 9 in the 2014-15 postseason rankings. The Raiders return eight of their top-10 rotation players from that team, though the two they lost were NAIA All-Americans Eric Thompson and Tim Weber. SOU's three starters back are seniors Joel Spear and Jordan West, and sophomore Ben DeSaulnier. West, a 6-foot-8 forward, averaged 15.1 points on 57-percent shooting, scored in double figures 26 games in a row and put up 21 per game at the national tourney. Spear started all 36 games at point guard with averages of 7.3 points, 3.1 assists and a 55-percent clip from the field, and DeSaulnier posted 11.8 points on 56-percent shooting in conference play as a true freshman guard. The Raiders open this season at Riehm Arena on Oct. 31 and Nov. 1, playing at 2 p.m. both days against New Hope Christian and Simpson. After those dates, all SOU home games will be played at Mountain Avenue Gym on the campus of Ashland High while McNeal Hall undergoes a complete renovation. Corban is sixth in the poll, and received a first-place vote despite not finishing better than sixth in 10 years. Eastern Oregon, Northwest, Evergreen and league newcomers Multnomah and Walla Walla round it out. The preseason All-CCC teams will be released today. The first NAIA Top 25 poll of the season will be released Oct. 27. The CCC went 6-4 at the NAIA Championships last season, as C of I and SOU appeared in the quarterfinals and Warner Pacific and Concordia won first-round games. Softball SIGNINGS ANNOUNCED : At Ashland, after leading the Southern Oregon University softball team to 33 wins in 2015, its most in 10 seasons, second-year Raider head coach Jessica Pistole has added 14 new faces for the upcoming 2016 campaign.
