File-This March 14, 2009, file photo shows Louisville's Andre McGee cutting down the net after the championship game of the Big East men's NCAA college basketball tournament. Louisville said Friday, Oct. 2, 2015, it ... By GARY B. GRAVESAP Sports Writer \nA book by an escort alleging that former Louisville staffer Andre McGee brought escorts into dorm parties, and paid for the women to strip and have sex with the Cardinals' recruits, their fathers and players is available online. \nLouisville is investigating allegations by Katina Powell in the upcoming book, \"Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen,\" from a publishing affiliate of the Indianapolis Business Journal. The 104-page book was available early Saturday, but some details were published on the Journal's web site on Friday. \nThe escort said during a four-year period many of the activities took place in the players' dormitory. \nLouisville officials say they learned of the allegations in late August and immediately notified the NCAA. McGee left Louisville in 2014 to become an assistant at Missouri-Kansas City. That school put McGee on paid leave Friday night and issued a statement saying the allegations were being taken seriously. \nThe age of consent to have sexual intercourse in Kentucky is 16, though in some instances it could be 18. It is unclear if a criminal investigation has also been launched in light of the allegations. \nLouisville Metro police spokeswoman Alicia Smiley said she was unaware of any investigation by the department, saying it was an issue to be handled by campus police. \nUniversity police operator Peter Anderson said he was unaware of the allegations and that no staffers were available to comment. Cardinals basketball spokesman Kenny Klein initially notified the compliance office about the allegations, but said he didn't know if police are involved. \nCardinals coach Rick Pitino said the situation caused sleeplessness when he first found out and said that he tried to conduct his own investigation before being rebuffed by the school's compliance office. \nPitino said McGee denied the allegations in a brief conversation. \nLouisville retained Chuck Smrt of the Compliance Group, which assists schools in NCAA cases, to review the allegations. \n\"Chuck is the quarterback of this entire project,\" Louisville athletic director Tom Jurich said. \"Chuck knows he's the most well-respected person, probably, within the NCAA and the NCAA has been involved every step of the way. We're an open book.\" \nThe Journal's summary of the book said that Powell brought women to 22 parties from 2010 to 2014 at Billy Minardi Hall, which houses Cardinals basketball players. \nThe woman said that she and three of her daughters, along with other women, danced and stripped for Louisville recruits and players and performed sex acts with them, according to the book. Powell, 43, also said McGee offered recruits alcohol at those parties. \nIn the book, Powell said that McGee initially brought women into the dorm through a side door. The process evolved to the point where the escorts entered and left the building through the front entrance and had become familiar to staff. \nJurich said he didn't know if video surveillance had been reviewed to back up that allegation and added, \"that would be a Chuck Smrt or an NCAA question.\" \nMcGee played for Louisville from 2005-09 and started 57 games during his career. He played professionally in Europe before becoming a program assistant in 2010 and was promoted to director of basketball operations in 2012. McGee could not be reached for comment. \nBoth Jurich and Pitino said they believe that money was the woman's motivation for writing the book. Powell was paid for the book, but said in an interview with the Journal that she felt it was important to tell the story. \nThe publishing company said it paid investigators and Pulitzer-Prize winning reporter Dick Cady to vet Powell's story, and based much of it on journal entries, photos and text messages. \nThe allegations come on the eve of Louisville's first Red-White scrimmage. The Cardinals reached the NCAA East Region final last season. \n\"To say I'm disheartened, disappointed would be probably the biggest understatement I've made since I've been a coach,\" Pitino said during a news conference. \"It's mind boggling to me how all this could go on. I've read that the statement that the publishing company put out and it almost got me sick to my stomach. \n\"My emotions right now, my heart is really broken.\" \n___ \nAssociated Press Writer Dylan T.
