I don't compare myself with these genius managers from the past,\" he added. \n\"Not one of these great managers said in his first press conference 'My target is I want to be a legend at the end of my time here'. \n\"This is a great club because of many good decisions in the past, good players, brilliant players, now we have to work in the present.\" \nNevertheless, Liverpool's long history and their 25-year wait for a title hangs heavy around those charged with restoring success to Anfield. \n\"Twenty five years ago is a long time,\" Klopp added. \n\"In this time all people have tried to get better, to improve, to take the next title. But history is only the base for us. It is all the people are interested in but you don't take history in your backpack and carry it with you for 25 years. \n\"We can wait for it but I don't want to say we can wait 20 years. If we sit here in four years I think we'll have won one title - I'm pretty sure.\" \nKlopp's use of the word title may have lost something in his own translation - he may have meant trophy - but having apparently set himself such a public target he appears to be Liverpool's best chance to deliver on that since Rafael Benitez walked through the door 11 years ago. \nA championship narrowly eluded the Spaniard but he did succeed in securing the club's fifth European Cup. \nKlopp, at least initially, has the fans believing in something similar once again.
