The Mustang senior running back has left his sweat, blood and tears out on the field but never scored a touchdown—until tonight. \nBollendorf, who started with the Gilroy Browns in fifth grade, reached the endzone not once, but twice for the Mustangs Friday as they celebrated homecoming and Senior Night. \n“We’ve always known he could do it,” Gilroy coach Jubenal Rodriguez said. “He was consistent in practice and look what happened.” \nUnfortunately for Gilroy, the touchdowns wouldn’t be enough. Late scores from the Spartans lifted Seaside to a 25-14 win at Gilroy High. \nGilroy needed just six plays to cover 91-yards for its first score of the game. Bollendorf completed the drive by punching the ball in from the 3-yard-line with 32.9 seconds left in the third to get the Mustangs within a score at 12-7. \nSeaside answered immediately on a reverse play from Keishawn Robinson to Malik Jeter for a 36-yard score. The Spartans 2-point conversion attempt failed, but they struck again six minutes later to jump ahead 24-7. \nGilroy quarterback Jon Jon Castro exploded for a 33-yard gain, setting the Mustangs up at 4-yard-line in the game’s closing minutes. Bollendorf took the ball the rest of the way for the final score of the game. \n“I would just like to thank my linemen for doing a good job blocking and I’d like to thank my family for coming out here and seeing me,” the Mustangs’ RB said. “I just got the ball and knew I had to score for my team. I just tried my best.” \nSeaside’s offense was electric in the first half, creating several scoring opportunities. The Mustangs’ defense rose to the challenge as it stopped the Spartans in the redzone two times. \nSeaside had the ball at Gilroy’s 9-yard-line and was poised to strike. But the Spartans fumbled the ball and Gilroy pounced, making a recovery. \nThe visitors were on the move again, getting down to the 18-yard-line of the Mustangs. Gilroy’s defense pushed them back to the 22, forcing them to settle for a field goal that bounced off the crossbar. \n“Defense definitely stepped it up, we’re just not at the point where we can keep it up for all four quarters—we’re not there yet,” Rodriguez said. “That takes time in the offseason and in the weightroom, but they played well.” \nGilroy (2-5 overall, 1-2 in league) returns to action at 2 p.m. Oct. 31 when it plays at North Monterey County. The Condors (2-4 overall, 2-0 in league) topped Pajaro Valley 31-14 this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:45:26.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
