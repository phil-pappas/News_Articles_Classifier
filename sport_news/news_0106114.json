He was with the San Diego Chargers the past two seasons. \nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:05:45.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
