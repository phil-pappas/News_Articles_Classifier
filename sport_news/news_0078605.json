And when it came to the Dodgers’ trauma after seeing their ace, Clayton Kershaw, lose another post-season game….well, there’s no quantifying that, either.\nJust know the Mets pulled off a near-miracle in Game 1 of the NL Division Series on Friday night, a 3-1  victory that changes everything. After an eight-year absence from the post-season, the Mets not only proved they deserve their place in October but they’re capable of doing serious damage along the way.\nFor that, they can thank deGrom, who did what non-believers said would be impossible: he matched Kershaw inning for inning, zero for zero, blistering the Dodgers with a blizzard of corner-strikes.\nDeGrom made history, too, striking out 13 and tying Tom Seaver for the club record in a post-season game. Michael Cuddyer wasn’t far from the truth when he said deGrom “could do whatever he wanted to” against the Dodgers. The right-hander generated a stunning 24 swings and misses – 15 on his fastball alone – which is why Don Mattingly was forced to admit the better pitcher had prevailed.\n“Obviously a lot of velocity, he beat us a lot with that,” Mattingly said. Specifically, deGrom got the Dodgers to chase his elevated fastballs, the ones that seemed to explode in the final five feet in front of the plate.\nDeGrom maxed out at 98-mph and clearly overpowered the Dodgers even a second and third time through the lineup. Most impressive, however, was deGrom’s indifference to pressure. He was being asked to give the Mets street cred – to create legitimacy where no one had existed since 2006. As if that wasn’t enough, deGrom had to ignore Kershaw’s massive presence. He's the major league’s strikeout king, after all, who the Dodgers were counting on take them to the World Series.\nBut it was Kershaw, not deGrom, who buckled and was on his way to a 1-6 career record in the postseason. Daniel Murphy launched a solo home run in the fourth inning – a massive shot to right – that stunned the sold-out crowd at Dodger Stadium. Nothing was the same from that moment on.Kershaw had struck out Murphy in his first at-bat with sliders, and the second baseman admitted, “he chewed me up and spit me out” in the process.\nBut the Mets were catalyzed by Murphy’s ambush of Kershaw’s 2-0 fastball the next time up, only his second HR of the year against a lefthander, The Dodgers, who are heavy favorites in this Series, realized the Mets were for real – they weren’t afraid of anything, not the Dodgers’ experience or national TV audience or even of Kershaw himself. Inning after inning, deGrom looked like a terminator, affixing a dead-eye stare on the Dodgers that told you he was that beautiful, strike-throwing altered state.\nBy the seventh inning, Kershaw was showing signs of fatigue, which brought Mattingly to a brutal crossroads. The Mets had worked the lefthander with several long at-bats, which resulted in walks to Lucas Duda and Ruben Tejada and then to Curtis Granderson, loading the bases.\nDavid Wright was next, and Mattingly decided he no longer trusted Kershaw to get out of trouble. “We felt like David’s really good – his numbers against lefties are really good,” is how Mattingly explained his next move.\nHe had no easy choice, really. Kershaw is the guardian of the Dodgers’ pitching staff, but they also remember what happened last year in Game 4 of the NLCS against the Cardinals. Cruising into the seventh inning, Kershaw tired then, too, but was allowed to remain in the game long enough to surrender a three-run HR to Matt Adams, ending the Dodgers’ season.\nSo maybe Mattingly was working around the scar tissue when he summoned Pedro Baez to deal with Wright. The right-hander throws exceptionally hard – his fastball averages more than 97-mph – but there’s one catch. When in doubt, when in trouble, Baez relies exclusively on velocity.\nWright was ready. When the count ran to 3-2, he geared up for the only weapon Baez had in his arsenal, the four-seam fastball.\n“I was fortune I got a chance to see a couple of fastballs early in the count that were balls, so I felt like timing-wise, I was on time,” Wright said. “So it was just sitting on something hard (with a full count). When a guy’s going that hard you allow him to provide the power and just try to go nice and easy and make sure you get to it and beat him to the spot.”\nThe formula was pure and simple, but nevertheless full of drama. Wright launched a single to center, scoring two runs and effectively smothering the Dodgers for the night.\nThe Mets went berserk in the dugout, and, afterward, were woozy with confidence, even if they had leftover issues. Tyler Clippard couldn’t get out of the eighth without allowing a run, which means Terry Collins will have to find a new bridge to Jeurys Familia. And deGrom, for all his brilliance, used up 120 pitches, so the chance of him pitching Game 4 on three days’ rest are practically nil. The ball will now go to rookie Steven Matz.\nBut those were minor surcharges for the night’s larger payoff. The Mets delivered a bold statement, not just to the Dodgers on Friday, but to the rest of the field. Watch out, is what the Mets said. It’s a warning best taken seriously. The Mets are already on a roll.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:55:02.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
