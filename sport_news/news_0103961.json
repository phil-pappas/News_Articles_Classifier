(AP) - Many protesters who showed up at the first game in eight years between Marcos de Niza and Corona del Sol high schools hadn’t heard: the tweet was false. \nKPNX-TV and KPHO-TV reported that a tweet said Corona del Sol was banning the American Flag, red white and blue as well as references to Donald Trump. The Tempe Unified High School District confirmed Friday that no ban was in place, and that all colors were welcome. \nNevertheless, a dozen demonstrators lined up and held American flags outside the stadium. \nMarcos de Niza and Corona del Sol have a tense history. The rivals faced off in a basketball game a couple years ago that resulted in police officers pepper spraying students to prevent a possible fight. \nFriday’s game ended without incident. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T21:45:23.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
