They all apply to the rest of the Pflugerville football schedule.\nAt 1-3 in District 13-6A and 1-6 overall, the Panthers have to win their final three games to reach four wins in district play — the de facto qualifying number to reach the postseason in an eight-team district.\n“We’ve got to win each week now,” Pflugerville coach George Herrmann said. “We’re on a three-game playoff stretch, that’s what I tell them. If we want to make the playoffs, we’ve got to win these playoff games now.”\nPflugerville’s Johnny Naylor (39) cuts up the field against Hendrickson Oct. 16. After falling to the Hawks, Pflugerville hopes to rebound against winless Westwood. Dawn Poole for the Pflugerville Pflag. That starts with Westwood, a team that’s struggling and still looking for its first victory after an 0-7 start to the season. The Warriors are coming off a 10-0 loss to Stony Point in Week 8, a game that showcased the positives and negatives from Westwood’s season.\nWestwood only mustered 137 total yards and punted seven times in a disappointing offensive showcase. But, the defense was solid against a talented Stony Point team that is also in the playoff hunt.\nWestwood’s defense forced a pair of fumbles, blocked a field goal and didn’t bend in the red zone when Stony Point threatened.\n“They’re a good football team, even though they haven’t had much success this year,” Herrmann said. “Defensively, they play hard and they run to the football.”\nOn paper, it’s a step down in competition for Pflugerville after the past three games. The Panthers lost to Round Rock, Hendrickson, and Cedar Ridge — three teams that have mathematically or realistically locked up a playoff spot — and they improved each week.\n“We’ve still got things we’ve got to correct,” Herrmann said. “But, we’ve played hard and physical football games each week, including last week (against Hendrickson). We had a spirited practice (Monday), and they’ve been positive. We’re pretty close to being a good football team.”\nUP NEXT\nWho : Pflugerville (1-6 overall, 1-3 in 13-6A) vs. Westwood (0-7, 0-4)\nWhen: Oct. 23, 7 p.m.\nWhere: Kuempel Stadium, Pflugerville", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/21/90/c4/DSC_8880.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T19:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:23:45.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
