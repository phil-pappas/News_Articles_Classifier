Cooper and the Hamilton-Wenham football team made sure Saturday was the day they inally got their running game on the right path. \nCooper ran for 116 yards and a pair of scores as the host Generals piled up 280 yards via the ground in winning for the first time this season, 34-7 over Georgetown. \nAs a team, the Generals finished with 285 yards of offense; all but 10 of those came when Cooper either tucked the ball and ran or handed off to one of his running backs. \n\"We've been determined to get the run game going a little bit,\" said Hamilton-Wenham head coach Andrew Morency, his team now 1-4 on the season. \"C.J. Cooper is one of those athletes that can run and pass, and we have a couple other guys who have been anxious to get the ball and run downhill as well. \n\"The kids just went with the game plan — and it worked out well for us.\" \nWhile Hamilton-Wenham was getting untracked and scored in all four quarters, Georgetown, which remained winless at 0-5, struggled to get its offense going the entire afternoon. The Royals have scored just 20 points combined in their five games thus far. \nThe Generals (1-2 in Cape Ann League Baker division play) began the game with nine straight running plays and never deviated from that formula. Cooper capped off a 61-yard drive to begin the contest with a 1-yard TD run. Freshman Adam Blanchard added the extra point to give the hosts a 7-0 lead just four minutes into the game. \nThings would settle down for a bit before Generals' senior captain Hunter Ascolillo produced a monster special teams play with just over eight minutes remaining in the half. The 5-foot-10, 170-pound speedster received a Royals' punt just on his own goal line and headed towards the left-hand sideline before reversing his tracks. He then followed his blockers and sprinted the length of the field for a 100-yard punt return touchdown. \nIt was the longest punt return, unofficially, in program history according to Morency. \nThe special teams play proved to be the turning point in the game as the Royals were never able to recover on either side of the ball. \nCooper added another touchdown run, this time from 10 yards out, 10-yard TD run late in the first half. Christos Meimeteas and Hunter Wilichoski would add second half touchdown runs of 7 and 3 yards, respectively, for the Generals. \n\"We're doing this for each other and as long as everybody has each other's backs and keeps that in mind, we'll be able to move forward,\" Georgetown head coach Eric McCarthy said after the loss. \"We can't let it go to somewhere where they start feeling bad about the situation. We just have to keep moving in the direction we're looking to go.\" \nGeorgetown was able to take some positives from the contest, most notably a fumble recovery that was returned 65 yards to paydirt by Ryan Sherman in the opening minutes of the third quarter. James Sherman's successful point-after attempt brought the Royals within two scores. \nHamilton-Wenham will look to make it back-to-back league victories when it plays at Amesbury Friday (7 p.m.).
