She said Layton had made \"mistakes, missteps and failings.\"\nWhile she successfully connected some would-be parents with donors and surrogates, she failed to keep good records, place money in trust accounts and separate business from personal funds, Cader said.\n\"As a result of this failure, she quickly found herself buried under the weight of these missteps,\" Cader said. \"When her wrongdoing came to light, she dug a deeper hole for herself, not being honest about her wrongdoing, but instead trying to keep her business afloat.\"\nLayton must also serve three years of supervised release after serving prison time.\nA restitution hearing has been scheduled Oct. 22.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:33:48.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
