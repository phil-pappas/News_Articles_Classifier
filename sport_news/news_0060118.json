Since then, that list has nearly doubled.\nThe sophomore from Upper Saddle River captured attention in 2014 by winning the North 1 floor championship as an independent competitor. She was one of two such entrants in the sectional meet to qualify for the state finals, along with Grace Gardella of Ramsey. The two went on to earn All-North Jersey first- and second-team honors, respectively.\nThis season, the number of independents in North Jersey has grown from five to eight, and the number of schools fielding multiple independent participants grew from one to three.\nSo, has Gneco’s success helped spark a trend?\n“Maybe,” she said, mulling the possibility after her gold-medal vault of 9.75 at this month’s Wayne Classic. “Maybe other girls didn’t know they could be an independent for their school until they saw us doing it and read the stories in the newspaper.”\nThe word-of-mouth – and print – theory seems to have merit.\nIn 2013, there were four independent gymnasts to appear in North Jersey meets, including two from Holy Angels: Alexis Driscoll and Darcy Ottomanelli. A year later, the duo captained the Angels’ inaugural varsity team, and their influence has spread even beyond their school.\n“I know the girls who started the Holy Angels team, and I thought it was cool because they got a chance to represent their school,” said Alison Keil, a freshman independent at NV/Old Tappan. “That’s kind of what motivated me to try and do that for NV/OT.”\nKeil trained at a club with Tenafly’s Bailey Abramowitz for many years and watched her friend compete as a solo gymnast a year ago for the Tigers.\n“Once Bailey started, that really pushed me to do it,” Keil said.\nNorthern Highlands, NV/Old Tappan and Tenafly each have two individuals on board this season. A minimum of three is required to be scored as a full team.\nGneco had 2015 graduate Lauren Nowakoski as a teammate last year, before freshman Erika Kluge of Ho-Ho-Kus joined the Highlanders this fall.\n“I just thought it’d be fun,” Kluge said, noting that the competition seems friendlier on the varsity level than on the club level.\n“I like having Erika with me,” said Gneco, who also does club gymnastics at Galaxy in Orangeburg, N.Y. “Having someone to talk to and bond with during the meets is nice.”\nAbramowitz, meanwhile, has gained a teammate in junior Chelsea Glasser. Keil and sophomore Haley English are the first NV/Old Tappan independents since All-North Jersey first-team pick Danielle Kirchhof in 2004.\nSara Buchner of Westwood and Stephanie Hunstein of Mahwah are the lone representatives from their schools, but compete in home meets with Ramapo and Indian Hills, respectively — which gives them teammates in spirit if not uniform color.\nAlthough, if the trend continues, any of this year’s independents could have more company in the future.\n“I’m happy being an independent,” Gneco said, “but if more girls want to come and join the team, I’d be happy with that, too.”\nEmail: tartaglia@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:08:02.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
