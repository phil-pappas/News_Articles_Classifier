Kickoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. at Spartan Stadium. \nM-E (4-0) has come out on top in its last six matchups with JC, including a 42-0 outcome last October when the Spartans’ 385-yard rushing total featured 134 from quarterback Kyle Balmer. M-E ball carriers averaged 13.6 yards per carry in that one. \nThe Wildcats (2-2) have limited their last two opponents to a seven-point output. Last weekend, Shafeeq Hosea rushed for 204 yards in a 43-7 rout of West Genesee. \nM-E fullback/defensive tackle Cordell Woolfolk, who left last week’s game against Vestal in the third quarter with an ankle injury, is expected to be suited up and ready to go against JC. \nThe winner will come away atop Division II with a 2-0 record. \nElsewhere around Section 4 … \nFRIDAY \nBinghamton (3-1) at Troy, Pa. (4-0): The Trojans have won their games by seven, one, 11 and 14 points, respectively, most recently dealing Wyalusing Valley its first loss in four games. The Patriots slipped past a winless Union-Endicott squad last weekend, 21-15. \nVestal (3-1) at Corning (3-1): Since an opening-night loss at Maine-Endwell, the Hawks have whacked three opponents for 42, 42 and 57 points, respectively. Vestal, beginning a stretch of three out of four away from Dick Hoover Stadium, seeks to regroup from a shutout loss served up by Maine-Endwell. \nSidney (2-2) at Sullivan West (1-3): The Bullgogs’ win came by forfeit in Week 1. In three on-field losses, they’ve given up an average of 60.3 points. \nWalton (3-1) at Delhi (2-2): The first night game at Delhi is overshadowed by turmoil in Bulldogs camp. Delhi coach Anthony Sampogna was dismissed early this week and replaced by former Hartwick assistant Mike Tracy. \nWalton looks to rebound from a 50-32 loss at Deposit/Hancock. \nSeton CC (0-4) at Bainbridge-Guilford (1-3): The Saints seek to log that first victory against a B-G squad that has surrendered a 48-point average yield in its three losses. \nDeposit/Hancock (4-0) at Unatego (1-3): New York’s fifth-ranked Class D team has scored 46 1-2 points per game. Unatego has allowed 37 per outing. \nUnadilla Valley (2-2) at Oxford (2-2): UV looks to make it three consecutive wins. Oxford was a 34-0 winner last week against Candor. \nSATURDAY \nTioga (3-1) at Harpursville (4-0), 1:30 — The top spot in Division VII will be up for grabs, as each will align for kickoff with a 2-0 division record. \nThe Hornets had a week of practice time to convert Madison Hoover to starting quarterback. Tyler King had manned the position, but he was injured on the third play of last Saturday’s game against Seton Catholic Central. Coach Tim Petras said King has a broken collarbone and will be out of action for six weeks. \nTioga is coming off a 401-yard rushing effort against Newark Valley, in which Jesse Manuel went for 218 and Adam Zwierlein 168. The Tigers, however, let an 11-point, fourth-quarter lead slip away and fell by 35-32. \nWaverly (4-0) at Chenango Valley (3-1), 2:30 — This one will have a good bit to say about the Division III championship picture as both bring in 3-0 records. \nThe Wolverines and ace quarterback Peyton Miller have produced 144 points, or, more than double the Warriors’ four-game output. CV is coming off a season-high 27-point showing in an eight-point win at Owego. \nOwego (3-1) at Susquehanna Valley (1-3), 3:30 — The Indians allowed 305 rushing yards in a loss last week to Chenango Valley. SV has been limited to single-digit scoring outputs each of its last two games, though against opponents that take to Week 5 with unbeaten records (M-E and Waverly). \nGreene (2-2) at Newark Valley (4-0), 2:30 — The Trojans are in the middle of their most demanding stretch of schedule this season, coming off a loss to Chenango Forks and with Waverly next up. The Cardinals gained 326 rushing yards last week at Tioga, headed by 160 and three TDs by Nick Schermerhorn. \nWindsor (2-2) at Oneonta (0-4), 3 p.m — The Black Knights bounced back from consecutive losses with last week’s 26-8 win over Lansing, in which Trevor Kimble passed for 201 yards and rushed for 104. \nNorwich (1-3) at Union-Endicott (0-4), 7 p.m. _ The Purple Tornado put a season-high 28 points on the board in last weekend’s 28-6 victory at Oneonta. U-E gave once-beaten Binghamton a handful before falling by 21-15 at Alumni Stadium. \nOn Twitter: @PSBKevin 5 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://press.sn/1FJp2Me TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:15:45.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
