Both running backs complement each other well on the field. Peter Haley Staff photographer 1 of 4 \nConnor Wedington has a lot of hair. Josh Riley has little. \nRiley played percussion in the band the past three years. Wedington keeps a respectable shoe collection. \nWedington has a few dance moves … while teammates say they have painstakingly witnessed Riley’s. \nBut for their differences off of the football field, the running backs for the Sumner High School football team complement each other so seamlessly on it. \nNo other team in the 3A South Puget Sound League has two running backs who have more combined yards than Wedington and Riley (1,371) do for unbeaten and fourth-ranked Sumner (6-0) this season. \nWedington leads the league with 802 rushing yards on 96 carries while Riley has 79 carries for 569 yards. Both are team captains. \n“I think Connor runs like (former Chicago Bears running back) Gale Sayers and Josh is more like Roger Craig (the former San Francisco 49ers, Los Angles Raiders and Minnesota Vikings running back), though they probably don’t even know who those players are,” Sumner coach Keith Ross said. \n“Connor is more of a smooth, silky, open-field runner. Josh is more of make-one-cut-and-go.” \nRoss said he’s never coached a player as gifted in the open-field and making defenders miss as Wedington. \nSo Riley, a senior, said he’s tried to learn a few moves from the junior. \n“He jukes everybody out every play,” Riley said. “So honestly this year, even though I’m a senior, I started picking up on Connor and how he jukes people out because I couldn’t do that last year very much.” \n“We got homecoming coming up, so I had to show him a couple moves last year,” Wedington said. \nIt’s hard to believe Sumner would be where it is — the front-runner for the 3A SPSL title — if not for them. \nThe Spartans have an inexperienced offensive line — an eclectic group ranging from 5-foot-10 to 6-foot-6 that Ross calls “misfits” — and a first-year starting sophomore quarterback in Ross’ son, Luke. \nBut the coach could build a good team around Riley and Wedington. \n“With our smaller offensive line, we are built on split back (offense),” Ross said. “We have to let teams know that they can’t cheat on one or the other.” \nBut that means they had to learn to share. Ross told Wedington before the season started not to be jealous of Riley’s carries. \nEnumclaw coach Mark Gunderson said his team’s entire game plan in its 35-7 loss to Sumner on Sept. 18 was centered around making Wedington a nonfactor because he had run for 199 yards against the Hornets last year. \nRiley ran for 137 yards on 13 carries. Wedington had 14 carries for 101 yards (his lowest output of the season). \n“We spent 90 percent of our time focusing on how we were going to limit (Wedington) beating us,” Gunderson said. “We definitely wanted to make someone else beat us. The Riley kid, unfortunately, did.” \nRoss said Wedington wasn’t thrilled with his role that game. \n“We used Connor as a decoy a little bit and he didn’t like that,” Ross said. “But I was OK with Connor because you want your alpha to want the ball. That’s a good learning experience because it’s a team game. We want him to want the ball, but that was our plan that game and it worked.” \nSumner doesn’t have specific run plays designed only for Wedington or only for Riley — who holds the school track and field team’s record in the high jump at 6-8 1/4 and is committed to the University of Montana as a decathlete. \nIt’s not like one is a bruising, short-yardage back and the other the big-play threat. They are interchangeable because both have speed — only Riley’s is more top-end while Wedington is more agile. \n“Defenses make the mistake of putting all their attention on Connor and they kind of forget about Josh,” Sumner right guard Ian Pudney said. “We want to get Connor in space because he can beat any defender one on one. But I think when we need three or four yards, Josh is more of the power guy. He gets whacked in there and he gets up ready to go every time.” \nBoth also play key roles on defense — Riley at linebacker and Wedington at defensive back. Wedington returns punts and kicks, too (he leads the 3A SPSL with 1,249 all-purpose yards). \n“I feel if one of us got all the carries it would tire and wear us out,” Wedington said. “I have confidence that Josh can do it all and I’m pretty sure he’s the same way with me. We can both run people over if we have to or spread it out if we have to. We just complement each other in so many ways.” \nEven if they are so different off the field. \n“Josh has been with the band his whole life and was a little nerdy, and Connor has always been silky smooth,” Ross said. “It’s cool to see what football can do because I don’t know if they would be friends otherwise.” \nt.cotterill@thenewstribune.com \nRATE YOUR RUNNING BACK \nWho better to gauge Sumner’s two dynamic running backs, Josh Riley and Connor Wedington, than their offensive linemen? Four of them — right tackle Jacob Clark, right guard Ian Pudney, center Kelley Kraeger and left tackle Seth Carnahan — gave their votes to questions regarding their running backs’ talents in areas on and off the football field. \n▪ SPEED \nClark: Got to say Josh. He can get going. \n▪ STRENGTH \nAdvantage: Riley \nPudney: They got a few differences, but when it comes to the basics, they are pretty similar. I guess Josh would get a slight edge. \n▪ AGILITY", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T09:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:05:43.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
