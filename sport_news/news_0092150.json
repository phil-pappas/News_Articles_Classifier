I've had the chance to cover teams that won state titles in football, boys and girls basketball, baseball, and softball, and last Saturday, I was able to add another sport to that list. \nI watched the Fisher Catholic boys golf team win the Division III state championship at Ohio State's Scarlet Course, and just like all the other state champions I've covered through the years, it was a thrill. \nGolf is kind of an individual sport, but when everyone's score is counted over two days, it truly was a team victory. \nGolf, in general, can be a grind, and probably more than anything, it comes down to who has the mental toughness to hang in there when things aren't going well. \nThe Irish took the first-day lead by three strokes, and even though they didn't play their best Saturday, they were able to withstand the windy, chilly conditions and ended up winning by eight strokes. \nFisher Catholic's state title run actually began four years ago when Travis Saffell took over as coach and this year's seniors were freshman. He knew then had four talented players: his son, Blake Saffell, as well as Aaron Wood, Tom Sylvester and Brady Taulbee. \n\"The first time I met the kids, we had a meeting, and I told them the goal was to win a state championship,\" Travis Saffell said. \"The kids kind of looked at me strange and probably didn't believe it at the time. \n\"I knew they were good athletes and good kids, and I just knew that if they worked hard and put the time in that good things would happen, but for it to finally come to fruition is unbelievable.\" \nThe Irish reached the state tournament two years ago and they just missed qualifying by a few strokes in 2014. \nHowever, this season would be different because the Central District was taking only one team and one individual. The Irish had a lot of pressure in the district, but they didn't bat an eye. They shot a scorching 306 and defeated perennial state powers Wellington and Newark Catholic. \nBlake Saffell lead the way with a 74, followed by Wood's 75, Taulbee's 78, Zach Saffell's 79 and Sylvester's 81. \nBlake Saffell and Wood once again led the way at the state tournament with being named first team All-Ohio. While those two players were mainstays all season, the other three players also played big partz, which is where the team aspect comes in. \n\"Golf can be a lonely sport because a lot of times, you are out there by yourself playing and working on your game,\" Blake Saffell said. \"You put in hours and hours of work alone and you have to keep reminding yourself of why you are doing it because sometimes you lose focus, you lose motivation. \n\"But all the time all of us put in to make it (to state) and win a state championship, it just makes that much more special. Hard work really does pay off. We really did put in the work the four years.\" Buy Photo \nTom Wilson (Photo: Jess Grimm/Eagle-Gazette) \nThe emotion of winning a state title had Aaron Wood in tears afterward, but he was still able to reflect on what it meant to him. \n\"It is just amazing,\" said Wood, who will now turn his thoughts on winning a cross country state title. \"Freshman year, coach said we have a chance to win a state championship, and I'm thinking there is no way because we are just a bunch of goofballs, but we pulled it together. It is a dream come true. All the work the past four years, all the summers, countless hours with great memories, and it all came together. There is not a better feeling in the world. All the hard work paid off.\" \nWatching teams win a state championship never gets old because they are far and few between, which is the reason it is so special. \nJust the raw emotion of seeing a kid like Aaron Wood break down in tears when he realized the Irish had accomplished what he thought was a pipe dream as a freshman was something that will always stay with me. \nOn the other hand, Blake Saffell was all smiles. He couldn't stop smiling, and who could blame him? Winning a state title in any sport is hard and doesn't happen very often. \ntwilson@lancastereaglegazette.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:30:06.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
