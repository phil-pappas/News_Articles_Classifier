Projecting the Field: A look at where the 64 3A boys soccer teams may be seeded in state tourney Ashbrook is the No. 3 overall seed according to the Gazette's projections, while Forestview comes in at No. 27 in the state Comment By Jack Flagler Posted Oct. 22, 2015 at 10:25 pm Updated at 1:38 AM Leading into the postseason, Gaston Gazette sports editor Jack Flagler will take a crack at projecting the 64-team fields for the state boys soccer and football tournaments. This is a first look at the 64 teams set to qualify for the 3A boys soccer tournament were the season to end today. There are 100 North Carolina high schools classified in the 3A division across 17 conferences. The NCHSAA splits these teams into “tiers” during the seeding process. The conference champions are seeded together, then the No. 2 finishers, the No. 3 squads, then all the other qualifiers. There are a few caveats we need to note here before breaking down the fields. A conference tournament champion that finished the regular season lower in the standings can grab the No. 2 spot in its conference and the automatic berth that comes with it. Additionally, teams need to finish the season with an overall winning percentage of .340 or higher to automatically qualify. Finally, there are still a few conference ties that may be worked out near the end of the season. For example, Forestview is tied with 2A school Lake Norman Charter for the second spot in the Big South. The Jaguars seeding will largely be determined by whether they fall to third or grab the second spot. Check back tomorrow for the 2A projections, and later this month for football. Once the NCHSAA has its 64-team field, it splits them geographically into the east and west. I didn’t take that step, but a top-32 seed is a decent indicator that a team will host its first round game. With that, here is my best stab at the 3A field. Notice any errors?
