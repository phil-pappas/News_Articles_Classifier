(AP Photo/Jonathan Bachman) \nLSU put all sorts of touches on the day to make it feel as much like a home game as possible for the visitors. The band played the South Carolina alma mater before kickoff and stadium speakers blared electronic music hit \"Sandstorm\" as is standard practice in South Carolina's Williams-Brice Stadium. \nBillboards around town were programmed to read \"Geaux Gamecocks! Make yourself at home.\" \n\"Our flag's flying today, and our state flag is flying. They've played some music for us, our alma mater prior to the game,\" said South Carolina athletic director Ray Tanner.

There wasn't much traffic and plenty of parking. Attendance was just 42,058 in a venue that seats about 102,000. \nLSU planned to donate all revenues beyond expenses to South Carolina and Red Cross donation centers were set up outside Tiger Stadium.

We've had a blast. Everybody's offered us drinks, food,\" Gilbert said. \"They understand the flooding, obviously, because it was much more prevalent here with Katrina and other things in the past. There's been a lot of hospitality.\" \nJust outside the stadium stood George and Kim Durham of Abbeville, South Carolina, who also drove down. They had extra incentive. Their daughter, Kristy, is a graduate student at LSU.

They've offered us food, drinks, and if we didn't have tickets they were going to give us tickets, but we bought some before we came down,\" George Durham said. \"It's like being a rock star, being out here today, but it's still kind of sad because so many people in South Carolina are hurting.\" \nMitchell Touchton, 18, is a South Carolina freshman who drove down with three other students. Classes were canceled last week because 34,000 students were too much for the city's damaged infrastructure to handle. \n\"The reception has been great. We walked past an LSU fraternity house and they were yelling Tiger Bait and we expected that,\" Touchton said. \"After that, every single tailgate we have passed has offered us food and drinks. It's been awesome.\" The South Carolina state flag, top right, and the South Carolina University flag fly over Tiger Stadium during the first half of an NCAA college football game between LSU and South Carolina in Baton Rouge, La., Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015.

But more rain was in the forecast Saturday. \n\"We've still got some breeches in some areas facing difficult times, so we'll assess it as we move forward,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:16:36.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
