It's still got a small-town feel even though it's not a small town. \n\"I think at the heart, it is still a small town; people still come out for that game.\" \nAnd they will Friday with both programs fighting for a Region 2-6A title. Oakland, which is ranked second in the state in Class 6A, enters the game 6-1 overall, 4-0 in league play. Riverdale is 5-2, 3-1. \nNo matter the record, this remains the biggest game of the year for real estate agent John Jones. \nThe former Riverdale offensive lineman, whose son, Pruitt, is an Oakland senior tight end, said winning this game means more than any other contest. \n\"It was ingrained in me my whole life,\" said Jones, a member of Riverdale's Hall of Fame. \"You were brainwashed to hate Oakland, and people at Oakland were brainwashed to hate Riverdale. \n\"You had all kind of buddies on the other team, so that made you want to beat them even worse. And you didn't want to be around them if you lost. You want those bragging rights. I still feel it's the game of the year.\" \nThis year the game is more than bragging rights. \nA traveling trophy will be presented to the winner of this year's contest for the first time in the series' history. The trophy is sponsored by L&K Trophy and WGNS, which helped come up with the idea. \nThe game also will be featured in the Great American Rivalry Series. The winning team will receive from that organization a trophy that the U.S. Marines provided. The game's most valuable player and the top student-athlete from each program also will be recognized. \nRiverdale holds a 32-13 series lead with its cross-town rival. However, Oakland has won the past two games and has a chance to win its third straight for the first time since winning four straight from 1987-1990. \n\"At one time, that was the one game we felt like we had to win each year just simply because year round we were going to hear it,\" former Riverdale assistant Ron Crawford said. \"It was going to be in our community, in our schools and at the basketball games. It was a big deal. \n\"You can go back, and The DNJ has always done a good job putting the (series) record in there. It's something we were proud of. It generated all of the momentum for our program at that time.\" \nThe rivalry has withstood the opening of two new high schools in Murfreesboro in Blackman, which opened in 2000, and Siegel, which opened in 2003. \n\"This was the first rivalry,\" said Ken Nolan, who was a principal at both Oakland and Siegel. \"It holds the flair of the first one. But I do believer there are other rivalries that have emerged and are a closer second, where there used to not be that. \n\"You used to have a Battle of the 'Boro and nothing else. All of the schools from the county are so good now. But there used to be just two teams. They were the pride of the 'Boro.\" \nReach Tom Kreager at 615-278-5168 and on Twitter @Kreager. \nBattle of 'Boro going pink \nThe Tennessee Titans has chosen the Battle of the 'Boro rivalry game between Riverdale and Oakland as part of the NFL's 'A Crucial Catch' campaign. \nBoth teams will have players, coaches and cheerleaders will be given pink NFL equipment and apparel to wear. That will include goalpost wraps, sweat bands, helmet decals, pink pom-poms and more to help raise awareness for breast cancer. \nThe game kicks off at 7 p.m. Friday at Ray Hughes Stadium. \nFriday's Games \n(All games at 7 p.m.) \nRiverdale at Oakland*", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:29:45.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
