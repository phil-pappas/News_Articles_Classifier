It was kind of bittersweet because it was our last LHS game, but it was nice to come out on top.” \nIn the final set, the Firebirds (23-16) looked on the verge of closing out a quick victory with an 11-5 lead following a few kills by juniors Emma Barberena and Naomi Hickman and freshman Rachel Hickman. \nBut the Lions (8-28) stormed back by winning 10 of the next 12 points, with three kills from junior Amelia Dunlap, a kill from sophomore Olivia Morgan, and blocks at the net by seniors Kyleigh Severa and Nez Iskandrani for a 15-13 advantage. The LHS student section broke into a “I believe we will win” chant after each point during the stretch and throughout the rest of the fourth set. \n“It’s crazy. It’s nothing like I thought it would be,” Dunlap said. “I remember sitting in the stands and being that person in the student section. It’s a whole different experience when you’re playing.” \nBoth teams traded points in the fourth set until they were tied, 20-20, when Free State senior Rebekah Andersson drilled a kill at the net and blocked an LHS attack. Rachel Hickman ended the match with kills on two of the last three points, lining up shots from the left side of the net. \nRachel Hickman, who started the season on the junior-varsity squad, had six kills in the final set and a game-high 16 kills in the match. \n“Tonight I said, ‘Rachel, just get your elbow up high and swing hard. The cross-court shot is open. You just have to go for it,’” FSHS coach Amy Hoffsommer said. “It’s her favorite shot. There it was, and that made her happy, and it kept going, so that was nice.” \nThe Lions rolled to a win in the first set, leading by as many as 11 points, feeding off the energy of their student section and the emotions of Senior Night. Morgan had four kills in the opening set, while senior Caroline Dykes added three blocks, and sophomore Laurel Bird had three aces. \n“We were just really excited,” said Dykes, who totaled eight kills and seven blocks. “We had our awesome student section, so shoutout to them. They helped us a lot. We were just in it to win it then. The second game, we kind of just let up a little bit because we weren’t expecting them to come back that strong.” \nAfter a 22-all tie in the second set, the Firebirds won with a key block from Naomi Hickman and two kills by Rachel Hickman. \n“Rachel always delivers,” said Johnson, who recorded 26 assists. “I just put that puppy back there, and she puts it down.” \nOf course, the Lions were hoping to walk away with a victory, but they were happy with their effort and how they played with in an intense atmosphere. \n“Very emotional. Oh my gosh,” Dunlap said. “The whole game was just a roller coaster. Sometimes we would have such high energy, and then other times, it’s kind of low and kind of frustrating. When we had a lot of energy, it was really fun.” \nBoth schools will compete in sub-state Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:00:41.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
