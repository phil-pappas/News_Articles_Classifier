The Vikings move to 9-1 on the season. \n\"I wasn't thrilled with how we started in the first set,\" said Head Coach Tyler Coupe. \"Milford scored 15 points and we had 13 errors. That's entirely too much in our end.\" \nThe Lady Vikes came back in the second and third set to control the match. \n\"We played the volleyball I expect us to play in the second and third set. We didn't let Milford dictate the pace of game,\" Coupe said. \n\"We were able to get everyone in the match and everyone I put in rose up to the challenge and they played their roles and they are making it much better as we go on this season.\" Senior middle blocker Cameron Wick roofs a kill during the 3-0 match win over the Bucs.
