Kings, Pittsburgh Penguins and Anaheim Ducks, with the Kings and Ducks contests coming on the road. \nIt wouldn't have been a surprise if they started 0-3, considering all three of those teams had Stanley Cup aspirations. \nThe Coyotes however, are currently 3-0. \nIt's not time to crown them Stanley Cup contenders, but their start should certainly be turning heads. \nIf the Coyotes can beat the Minnesota Wild Thursday evening, it'll be the first 4-0 start in franchise history. \nCoyotes Fast Start Stats: 9th in Goals per Game: 3.33 Tied 2nd best Goals Against: .67 Tied 1st Penalty Kill: 100% Anthony Duclair and Max Domi are 1st and 2nd, respectively, in the NHL for points by a rookie. \nThe key to Arizona's start has been their youth movement, and specifically the play of Anthony Duclair and Max Domi. \nDuclair leads all NHL rookies with three goals, after scoring a hat trick against the Ducks, and Domi has added two goals and two assists of his own. \nAlso, consider the team's best player, Oliver Ekman-Larsson, is only 24 years old. \nThe Coyotes aren't only young guns though, as the team features veterans such as Antoine Vermette, Brad Richardson and of course the captain Shane Doan. \nGoalie Mike Smith is playing at an All-Star level through three games as well. \nSo how long can the Coyotes keep this high level of play up? \nWell as long as the rookies can keep their play up. \nDomi and Duclair will likely hit a wall at some point in the season, as it's unlikely they keep this rapid scoring pace up throughout the whole year as rookies. \nIf they can though, look out. \nOct 14, 2015; Anaheim, CA, USA; Arizona Coyotes left wing Anthony Duclair (10) reacts against the Anaheim Ducks at Honda Center. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports (Photo: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports) \nThe key for Arizona is if the team's rookies do level off, the vets need to step in. \nIf guys like Martin Hanzal and Mikkel Boedker can pick up any slack that comes later in the season, the Coyotes could continue to surprise. \nAt the start of the season, the Arizona Coyotes seemed to be a team that would be competing in the Auston Matthews sweepstakes. \nThe ceiling for the Coyotes is probably a seventh or eighth seed in the Western Conference this season, but hey, a playoff berth is much better than watching lottery balls. 3 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://12ne.ws/1LwfdBz TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:12:36.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
