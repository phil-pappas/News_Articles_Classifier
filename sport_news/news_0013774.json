But that was an unofficial team and we were not involved in that,\" a PCB spokesman told APP. \n\"PCB's support was sought for the tour, but with the relevant government clearances promised by the team not forthcoming, we had declined to support the tour,\" he added. \nHe said that the Greece cricket authorities were informed well in advance of the team embarking on its journey to Pakistan.
