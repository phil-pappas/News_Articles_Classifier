Below is the latest Big 12, voted on by members of the NBC12 and RVA Network sports staffs: \n1) L.C. Bird (7-0) - No problems for the Skyhawks against Cosby, rolling 34-6. J.B. Wright rushed for two more touchdowns, while Jalen Elliott tossed for a pair of scores as well. (Last week- #1; vs. George Wythe) \n2) Hermitage (7-0)- The Panthers ventured out of district last Friday, but were business as usual, topping Manchester, 44-31. Herm jumped out to a 41-7 lead, as Eli Odom accounted for six touchdowns in the first half. (Last week- #2; vs. Mills Godwin) \n3) Highland Springs (6-1)- It was another impressive night for the Springers, who posted their second straight shutout over a respectable opponent, topping Lee-Davis, 42-0. Highland Springs's explosive offense jumped out to a 28-0 lead by halftime and never looked back. (Last week- #3; vs. Henrico) \n4) Benedictine (6-0)- In what was thought to be a possible state title game preview, and in a rematch of last year's championship title, Benedictine flexed its muscle in a 49-0 rout of Bishop Ireton. The Cadets made it look easy, slamming the door with a 27 points second quarter. (Last week- #4; vs. Woodberry Forest, 10/24) \n5) Thomas Dale (6-1)- The Knights rolled to their fifth straight win with a 52-6 victory at Petersburg. Dale had a 32-0 lead at halftime as it continues to make its case for the top seed in 6A south. (Last week- #5; vs. Meadowbrook) \n6) Henrico (6-1)- After a close first half, the Warriors' defense stepped up in the final two quarters to shutdown Atlee and give Henrico a 34-20 victory. The offense also provided a much-needed spark, showing balance and headlined by Xavier Goodall's 245 rushing yards. (Last week- #7; @ Highland Springs) \n7) Douglas Freeman (7-0)- The Rebels move up a spot after a 45-15 triumph against J.R. Tucker. Trey Laughlin threw for four touchdowns to fuel the Freeman win. (Last week- #8; @ Deep Run) \n8) Monacan (7-1)- Syour Fludd continues to get back into the swing of things following his injury and looked good in the Chiefs' 60-6 win over George Wythe. De'Andre Williams was a force on both sides of the ball, tallying two touchdown receptions and racking up eight tackles, including three sacks and a safety. (Last week- #9; @ Midlothian) \n9) Hanover (5-2)- Usually a running team, the Hawks went to the air a little bit more in their 45-9 victory over Varina last Friday. Marcus Bazala threw for three touchdowns, two to Jack Chenault, as Hanover bounced back from a rough showing against Highland Springs. (Last week- #12; vs. Lee-Davis) \n10) Lee-Davis (6-1)- The Confederates suffered their first setback of the season, falling to Highland Springs and failing to score. Lee-Davis still has some stiff competition down the stretch in Hanover, Henrico and Patrick Henry. (Last week- #6; @ Hanover) \n11) Hopewell (5-2)- Hopewell returns to the poll after its third straight win, a 47-14 win over Colonial Heights. Seven different players scored for the Blue Devils in the victory. (Last week- NR; vs. Matoaca) \n12) Manchester (5-2)- The Lancers couldn't keep up with the Hermitage offense, and couldn't figure out the Panther defense until it was too late, falling 44-31. Tom Hall's team continues to battle injury, as running back Bryce Hall was carted off the field in the third quarter in his first game back from a previous shoulder injury. (Last week-#11; vs. Clover Hill) \nCopyright 2015 WWBT NBC12.
