That changes Saturday when he leads No. 1 Ohio State against Rutgers at 8 p.m. at High Point Solutions Stadium in a nationally televised game with an anticipated electric atmosphere . With Meyer coming to town, here is a look at how some other college football coaching greats fared when facing Rutgers in New Jersey. \nJoe Paterno, Penn State: The winningest coach in FBS college football history picked up six of his 409 career victories with no losses against Rutgers at Giants Stadium. \nOf the games played in 1977, 1983, 1985, 1989, 1992 and 1995, the closest one was 17-10 in 1985. \nIn 2009, Paterno and his disciple Greg Schiano reached a home-and-home series agreement for Penn State to play at Rutgers in 2014. It stayed on the books and became Rutgers first Big Ten league game. \nFormer Penn State coach Joe Paterno earned six of his 409 career wins against Rutgers in New Jersey.

It was a matchup of 4-0 teams at Giants Stadium on Oct. 11, 1980. \nRutgers scored first and had the ball on Alabama’s 33-yard line late in the fourth quarter but could not convert and lost 17-13. \nBefore the game, Alabama kickoff specialist Tim Clark said, \"I first learned there was a Rutgers when I read it on the schedule before the season started.\" \nAfterward, Bryant, who won six national titles, said, “We won the game, but Rutgers beat us.” \nMack Brown, Texas: Six years before he led Texas to the national championship, Brown was on the visitor’s sideline for Rutgers home-opener under the lights in 1999 . \nTexas, which beat Rutgers, 48-14, at home in 1997, jumped out to a 21-3 first-quarter lead. \nBrown was fired at the end of the 2013 season. \nFrank Beamer, Virginia Tech: In his first trip to Rutgers, Beamer lost 50-49 on a last-second 15-yard touchdown pass from Bryan Fortay to Chris Brantley as Rutgers celebrated Homecoming 1992 . \nBeamer got plenty of revenge, winning the next five times the old Big East rivals met in Piscataway. \nIf the winningest active coach in the FBS is still at the helm of Virginia Tech in 2023, he will be back in town. \nVirginia Tech coach Frank Beamer had reason to smile after winning at Rutgers in 1999. (Photo: AP) \nSteve Spurrier, Duke: In his first season as a “Head Ball Coach” at the college level, the later-renowned offensive guru Spurrier couldn’t solve Rutgers defense in a 7-0 loss at Giants Stadium. \nRutgers halfback Harry Henderson broke a scoreless tie with six minutes left in the fourth quarter on a rain-soaked night in front of a sparse crowd. \nSpurrier earned 228 victories at Duke, Florida and South Carolina before abruptly retiring last week . He led Florida to the national title in 1996. Rutgers football's Top 10 games of pre-Big Ten era \nBrian Kelly, Cincinnati: Before becoming coach at Notre Dame, Kelly spent three seasons at Cincinnati and went 3-0 against Rutgers during that span, including road wins in 2007 and 2009. \nKelly picked up a fourth win against Rutgers when Notre Dame prevailed in the 2013 Pinstripe Bowl, one season after losing to Alabama in the BCS National Championship Game. \nIn his first season as a college football head coach, Steve Spurrier, who retired just last week, lost to Rutgers in 1987. (Photo: Jonathan Bachman, AP) \nJohnny Majors, Pittsburgh and Tennessee: In his second stint at Pittsburgh, which he coached to the national title in 1976, Majors beat Rutgers at Giants Stadium in 1993 and lost at Rutgers Stadium in 1995. \nMajors notched a 7-0 win against Rutgers with Tennessee at Giants Stadium in 1983. \nTom Coughlin, Boston College: Better known for his stints in the NFL, including two Super Bowl titles with the Giants, Coughlin was the losing coach when Rutgers hosted its first ever Big East game in 1991. He beat Rutgers at Giants Stadium in 1993. \nRutgers also had visits from two other current NFL head coaches, Bruce Arians of the Arizona Cardinals when he was at Temple in the 1980s and Jim Caldwell of the Detroit Lions when he was at Wake Forest in 1997. \nBefore he won two Super Bowls with the Giants, Tom Coughlin coached in the Big East at Boston College from 1991-93. (Photo: The Tennesean) \nDon Nehlen, West Virginia: The College Football Hall of Famer was the 17th winningest coach in the sport's history (202 victories) when he retired in 2001. \nRutgers didn’t join the Big East until 1991 but faced West Virginia every season from Nehlen’s first in Morgantown in 1980 through 2011. Nehlen was 4-2 in Piscataway and 4-1 against Rutgers at Giants Stadium. \nJerry Claiborne, Kentucky: A former player for Bear Bryant, Claiborne won 178 games but lost 19-18 to Rutgers at Giants Stadium in 1987. \n​ Tubby Raymond, Delaware: The 300-game winner went 3-3 against Rutgers from 1967 through 1973 but won just once in four games On the Banks. He remained Delaware’s coach through 2001. \nStaff Writer Ryan Dunleavy: rdunleavy@gannettnj.com 1 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1RVMRli TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:38:03.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
