Shown left to right are Kendra Nolan, Kate Vialet, Alex Gutwill, Kylie Mastricola, and Olivia Lisa. \nWhen considering the kind of things that can keep the coaches of a sports program awake at night, one’s mind may shift to the thought that a team has a daunting opponent the next day, maybe a contest versus a heated rival or a championship event. \nBut, there are certainly other things that can cause coaches concern, and that includes figuring out which players have what it takes to lead the team in the right direction. \nSometimes a head coach is quite fortunate to have one or two competitors on their roster who fit the description of being not only a team leader, but also a team captain. \nIt’s safe to say that lack of leadership isn’t a problem for the Jefferson High School field hockey program this season. The Falcons have five captains who are doing a good job this season: Kate Vialet (defense), Alex Gutwill (midfield/forward), Kendra Nolan (midfield/forward), Olivia Lisa (forward/defense), and Kylie Mastricola (midfield/forward). \n\"Since the very beginning these players knew the importance of being a part of a team,\" Jefferson head coach Danielle Ryan said. \"From the first time they stepped on the field as freshmen they brought work ethic and determination. They demanded a lot of themselves and the team as well. They are the types of players that any coach would want on their team. They are selfless athletes that will do anything and play anywhere if it was what the team needed to be successful.\" \nThe ways in which the five captains guide the team properly has become evident. Through 15 games against tough competition, the Falcons had an overall record of 6-8-1. \n\"As the season progressed I saw the chemistry of the team come together,\" Ryan said. \"We were improving many aspects of the game which in turn led us to create more scoring opportunities and to have a more solid defensive unit. These athletes are versatile and can truly play anywhere on the field. Since the beginning of the season I have seen these players become more confident players. \n\"My captains are committed to each player on our team. They understand if one player is struggling that can affect the team. I have seen them encourage and lead the team in the most positive way. They lead by example in that every time they take the field they give full effort and determination. Even when we are facing the most difficult opponent, these athletes show the team what it means to play with their heart.\" \nNotes \nEach captain is very strong in the classroom and Ryan noted some of their academic achievements: \nAlex Gutwill: National Honor Society and Honor Roll \nKylie Mastricola: National Honor Society for Sign Language and Honor Roll \nKate Vialet: Math National Honor Society and Honor Roll \nOlivia Lisa: National Honor Society for Sign Language \nKendra Nolan: French National Honor Society and Honor Roll © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:00:32.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
