But with such limited time remaining, the Steelers probably weren't going to have a chance to call a timeout if they failed to reach the end zone, meaning they could either kick a game-tying field goal to send the game into overtime or gamble with one play from the 1-yard line.\nThe Steelers went for the win.\nInstead of running a quarterback sneak with Michael Vick or even handing the ball off to Le'Veon Bell , the Steelers lined up in a wildcat formation, meaning that Bell was 6 or 7 yards away from the goal line.\nAt the onset of the play, Bell seemed to be stuffed a few yards behind the line of scrimmage. But Bell kept driving forward. With no time remaining on the clock, just before his knee hit the ground, he extended the ball over the goal line.\nThe Steelers won on a walk-off touchdown.\nThe @Chargers stood him up behind the line. Game over if @L_Bell26 doesn't keep going. He kept going. #WalkoffTD http://t.co/01rUflny21 \nâ€” NFL (@NFL) October 13, 2015 The play was reviewed to see if Bell got the ball over the goal line before his knee hit the ground, but the call stood. And the Steelers walked away with an unbelievable and gutsy win. Le'Veon Bell barely got the ball across for the game-winning touchdown.
