It has not only been an unending source of nourishment but also part and parcel of our culture. Her divine powers to purge a person of all his sins have been sung in various Hindu scriptures. The Ganga is first mentioned several times in Rig Veda, considered to be the earliest of the four Vedas. In Rig Veda 3.58.6 it says, “Your ancient home, your auspicious friendship, O Heroes, your wealth is on the banks of the Jahnavi (another name for Ganga).” The Ganga is a highly revered river of India. Referred to as Ma Ganga, she is not merely a river to Hindus, but rather a Goddess whose divine purity cleanses all the past sins and karmas of anyone who washes themselves with her waters, aiding their path towards liberation. Hindus keep a vial or flask of Ganga water in their homes to be used on all important occasions of life i.e, marriage, birth and even death. Ganga water is given to the sick, as it is believed to cure all illnesses. It is sprinkled as a benediction of peace; is used to cleanse and purify any place, person or object, as it has the power to purify anything and everything. Due to this reverence for Mother Ganga, one can find hundreds of temples lining its entire length. During all rituals, pujas, and yajna and havan ceremonies, the Ganga is invoked every day throughout India and her water acts as a purifier. In their journey to self-realization, many learned saints, spiritual leaders and divine souls have come to the Ganga banks and still continue to do so. They have come with the faith that Gangajal is the direct route to God. Many prominent Hindu spiritual masters have not only reached enlightenment on her banks but have also risen deeply in love with her. In fact, it is said that the Ganga and revered saints share a very special relationship. The Ganga not only holds great spiritual and cultural significance, also her unique, natural characteristics have made her a fascinating subject of study for many scientific inquiries. A container or vial of sacred water from Ganga, known as Gangajal, can be found faithfully stored in most Hindu homes, and this water has often been observed to remain fresh for long periods of time. These observations and many other healing qualities that the Ganga is believed to possess are not purely faith-based beliefs, but rather have now been supported by much scientific evidence and research. Some of the earliest scientific findings related to the unique qualities of Ganga were recorded by the early British in India. Ganga’s high oxygen retention capacity, especially in the upper stretches of the river that originates from the Himalayas, is yet another reason why her waters don’t putrefy even after long periods of storage. DS Bhargava, an environmental engineer at the University of Roorkee, in a comprehensive three-year study found that Ganga’s oxygen retention capacity is 15-25 times higher than any other river in the world. Although the massive amount of organic pollutants dumped into the Ganga could have easily consumed the amount of oxygen found in her water, some unknown mystery factor believed to be catalysed by unidentified microbes has been able to replenish the river’s oxygen content. The lofty eulogistic references and prayers to the Ganga by saints and seers in a state of heightened consciousness can’t be in vain. Civilizations have survived, and thrived along its banks. However, people despite their profound reverence for the holy river pollute her regularly. Numerous colonies along its banks, dharamshalas, ashrams, hotels and industrial units are diverting waste and sewage into the Ganga. Pollution is no address for the holy mother. Pollutants are affecting its purity and high mineral contents that had always surprised people, especially scientists and researchers. The first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, who was born in Allahabad along the Ganga banks, had said, “The Ganga, especially, is the river of India, beloved of her people, round which are intertwined her memories, her hopes and fears, her songs of triumph, her victories and her defeats. She has been a symbol of India’s age-long culture and civilization, ever changing, ever flowing, and yet ever the same Ganga.” Lasting freshness of Ganga water amazed British, scientists British physician Dr CE Nelson observed that water even in the dirtiest sections of the Ganga, such as a sample taken directly from the mouth of the Hooghly, remained fresh during the long boat journey back to England. The British East India Company, a seventeenth-century company that pursued trade mainly with India and China, also preferred using Gangajal for their three-month journey back to England stating that the water stayed “sweet and fresh”. Even kings and princes like Akbar and the Maharaja of Jaipur carried Gangajal in massive urns for their personal use and during travel. British physician E. Hanbury Hankin, in a paper published in the French journal Annales de Institut Pasteur in 1896, observed that the bacterium that causes the deadly cholera disease could be killed within three hours of being treated with water from the Ganga. However, the same bacterium continued to thrive in distilled water ever after 48 hours. This unique factor present in Gangajal, now known to be a virus which eats and destroys disease-causing bacteria, was amongst the first modern citations of a bacteriophage. Additionally, Flix d’Herelle, a French microbiologist in 1927, was amazed to find that no germs existed in a sample of Gangajal extracted from an area just a few feet below floating corpses who had died of dysentery and cholera, where one would typically predict to find millions of germs! Besides, by continuously flowing and rubbing against many rocks, flora, mosses and other natural growth that exist along her upper stretches, the Ganga becomes saturated with minerals and enriched with nutrients that supplement living organisms dependent on her waters, and these minerals give the river further antiseptic qualities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:12:41.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
