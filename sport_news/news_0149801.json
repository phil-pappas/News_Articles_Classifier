News Herald Executive Sports Editor Panama City News Herald News Herald Executive Sports Editor Posted Oct. 2, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated at 11:50 PM News Herald Executive Sports Editor Posted Oct. 2, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated at 11:50 PM PANAMA CITY — Bay took deflategate to an entirely new level Friday night at Tommy Oliver Stadium. Not only did the No. 9 Tornadoes take the air out of Pensacola’s offense in a 23-7 District 1-5A game, if handing out a game ball afterward they would have to completely deflate the football and slice it into numerous pieces. At least five for each member of the offensive line, and probably more for other lead blockers who also helped with the dirty work. It wasn’t as if all phases didn’t contribute on Bay’s Homecoming. Three different players scored touchdowns, Tanner Reese added a key 30-yard field goal and the Tornadoes defense shut out the Tigers the rest of the way after Pensacola scored on its opening possession. Not to mention forcing three second-half turnovers. But not even workhorse running back Raekwon Webb’s 158 yards rushing and one touchdown on 43 carries could overshadow the work done up front. The story of the game for Bay, now 5-0 and 2-0 in the district, was reduced to three possessions. The Tornadoes marched 69 yards on 16 plays to tie the game in a drive that melted 6 minutes, 23 seconds off the clock in the second quarter. They were just getting started. Bay added a 17-play, 60-yard excursion that lasted 7½ minutes and led to Reese’s field goal for a 10-7 edge in the third quarter. Then following the Tigers’ lone three-and-out of the night, it was a 17-play, 71-yard marathon to the clinching touchdown by quarterback Justin Davis. Incredibly, that possession included three fourth-down conversions and lasted 10:02. “We thought they were too fast for us to run outside,” Bay coach Jimmy Longerbeam said. “We had to pound it inside and I thought we played really good defense. That and our special teams played good. “This win was huge for our kids.” Pensacola slid to 3-3, 0-1, but presented a solid pedigree of games against Class 6A teams and staunch defensive showings entering the showdown. When the Tigers rolled 67 yards in 11 plays to Torrance Hackworth’s 9-yard run to the opening touchdown on their first series, Bay had little response. Despite great field position at their 40, 45 and 35 to ignite their offense, the Tornadoes gained only 18 yards in the first quarter. They didn’t even record a first down until 10 minutes left to halftime. Thereafter they leaned on the offensive front of Kingson Hill, Malik Whitley, Darrien Brown, Samuel Alston and Christion Gainer. Bay never did chew off huge chunks of yardage with its running game, Webb incredibly with only one carry of more than 8 yards and that for 14, but neither did the Tornadoes’ front line allow any penetration. Page 2 of 2 - “After the second time in a row (without a first down) we knew we had to come out hard,” said Whitley, a 285-pound senior. “At the end of the second quarter they had their hands on their hips. We knew if we got a hat on a hat we’d be good.” Webb scored Bay’s first touchdown while running 14 times in the drive and squirting over from the 4. The second TD possession was even more impressive considering the fourth-down conversions. “We ran the same play every time, Iso left,” Whitley said. The name of the ball carrier was a foregone conclusion. Pensacola didn’t have an answer. Bay’s dominance was so complete that with fourth-and-2 from the Pensacola 11 and 5:18 remaining, Longerbeam disdained a field goal that would have opened a six-point lead. Webb pushed the ball forward, and it was left to Davis, who spent most of the game handing off, to wedge in from the 1 with 2:32 showing. It came on, what else, another fourth-down snap. Bay’s defense supplied the exclamation mark when Jonathan Echols Jr. intercepted Tigers quarterback Sederick Smith and returned 35 yards for a touchdown two plays later. Pensacola’s last series ended with Javylon Wilson’s interception in the end zone, and the Tornadoes also forced a critical turnover when Joseph Boehm’s fumble recovery ended the Tigers opening series of the second half. Little did they know they’d only get the ball back twice more. With the victory, the Tornadoes exceeded their win total for all of last season. They travel to play at 4A East Gadsden next week.
