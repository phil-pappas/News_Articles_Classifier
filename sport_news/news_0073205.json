From Staff Reports \nThe alumni of Hampshire High School returned to their school grounds on Saturday, Oct. 17. Some were from graduation classes from the 1940’s, and of course some from a year ago. \nSome of the group were Red Devils from the old school building and the “Red Barn” gym, others who attended during the new building and gym era. Most of the group were Hawks, a mascot the school changed to three decades ago. \nThe Hampshire alumni game raised over $7,500 for the high school cheerleaders. It was a described as a wonderful event. \nThe girls game was highlighted by 1974 graduate Marsha (Rowland) Kinzer playing while Rock Jaggers (1971) played in the guys game. Hampshire graduate David Harville was honorary referee. A quilt that was hand quilted by Patricia Duncan and other community members from a quilt top which belonged to the late Gladys Renfro, long time Hampshire resident, was the hot item of the auction….bringing an amazing $2000. \nSaturday’s reunion of the alumni showed to many what a special place that Hampshire is.
