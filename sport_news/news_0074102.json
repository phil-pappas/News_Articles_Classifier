(Photo: The Enquirer/Kareem Elgazzar) \nTHE DEHNER DECISION \nThis wasn’t a poor Buffalo defense. The Bills boast a scary front seven and one of the best young cornerback tandems in football. \nThe Bengals sliced and diced them in the second half to sap any drama out of Sunday afternoon at Ralph Wilson Stadium. \nSound like a theme? Outside of the win at Baltimore and last week against Seattle the first six weeks of the season have contained little drama thanks to this offense. At this point it’s fair to wonder if any defense can slow them down as long as they stay healthy. The Bills and Rex Ryan certainly couldn’t. \nTeams can’t keep up with these weapons and heading into the bye week at 6-0 with two weeks to prepare for Pittsburgh should leave the Bengals coaches kicking back with their feet up and smile on the face. Bengals now 6-0 with win over Bills \nGAME BALL: Andy Dalton \nGiving the game ball to Andy Dalton every week might feel like a cop out, but hard to deny at any point he hasn’t been worthy. Again, Dalton orchestrated the Bengals offensive circus efficiency while the Bills threw different looks around. \nDalton not only went without an interception, he checked masterfully into a run play against a Bear defense for the Giovani Bernard touchdown run and found the 6-inch height difference between Tyler Eifert and Bacarri Rambo for a third-quarter touchdown. \nSeven players caught passes, four others rushed. \nDalton finished with 22 of 43 for 243 yards. He had a passer rating of 118.6. Now he has six consecutive games with a passer rating of at least 95. He’s also topped 115 in five of his first six games. The only one lower was when leading a 17-point fourth-quarter comeback against the Seahawks.
