I thought we had a good solid summer, but we have a lot of new faces.” \nThe Wildcats — picked seventh in the Big 12 this season — went 19-14 last year and advanced to the second round of the WNIT. \nK-State, which opens the exhibition slate Nov. 2 at home against Washburn, returns eight letter winners this season, including three starters in juniors Kindred Wesemann and Bre Lewis and sophomore Shaelyn Martin. Also back is senior Bri Craig, sophomore Jessica Sheble and junior Kelly Thomson. \nThe biggest difference this fall, Mittie said, is the addition of so many new faces to the team and the work it takes to get everyone on the same page. Slowing that process are some injuries he hopes will clear up within the next couple weeks. \n“With all the new faces, there’s a phase where everybody is at,” he said. “You have the returners that are at a whole other level of what they can process and do in practice, and then you have that young group that still is not there, and that has been challenging. \n“It’s a different challenge than a year ago where everyone was on the same learning curve. That has probably given us the biggest challenge going forward.” \nK-State’s freshman class includes 6-foot-6 center Cheyenne Hooper, 5-10 guard Anna Hammaker and 6-1 guard Kayla Goth. Other new additions include Wamego product Kaylee Page, who transferred from Nebraska last winter, and senior Megan Deines, who transferred from Louisville. \n“I think our young group is where they need to be, with the exception of a few injuries and those kind of things because we have been a little more banged up than we were a year ago,” Mittie said. “All in all, I think we had a good summer and I think we have had a good early fall. Practice the first two weeks has not been as good as I would have liked, but at the same point, I think we are still making decent progress.” \nThe Wildcats’ open the regular season Nov. 13 at Tulsa. The home opener is Nov. 16 against Abilene Christian at 5:30 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:32:57.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
