Sturgis City Manager Daniel Ainslie says the city is looking to hire for the position by January. Sturgis estimates that a record 739,000 people attended this year's rally, beating out the previous record of an estimated 633,000 people who flooded Sturgis at the 60th rally in 2000. Ainslie says the position includes a lot of planning and working with sponsors and vendors. Applications have come in from locals and as far away as South Africa. Brenda Vasknetz is stepping down to explore new options after seven years as director of the annual rally. Â© 2015 Associated Press. All rights reserved.
