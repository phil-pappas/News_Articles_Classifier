The Raiders rolled to a Region 5 victory over the Greyhounds, 49-10. slideshow MARIETTA — Walton outgained Pope 295-6 in the first half and took a 49-0 lead into the intermission on their way to a 49-10 win on Friday. Raiders quarterback Addison Shoup threw for 214 yards and one score. Shoup also added two touchdowns on the ground. Walton freshman Dominick Blaylock caught four passes for 66 yards and a score, and also returned a punt for a touchdown, giving Walton a 35-0 advantage near the end of the first quarter. “There are actually a lot of things we didn’t do well (Friday),” Walton coach Mo Dixon said. “We threw some interceptions and made some mistakes, but we also did some things well. They turned the ball over some, and that helped us.”Pope committed four turnovers in the first half, setting Walton up with ideal field position on early scoring drives. The Raiders scored their first touchdown of the game on just the third play from scrimmage, when Shoup pulled an option read and ran to the right corner of the end zone for a 26-yard score. “I probably need to learn, that’s the second time we’ve taken the ball first, and the last time we played pretty well offensively, and we did (Friday) also. I’m a defensive guy so I sometimes like to let the other team handle the ball, but we got off to a good start.” Dixon said.K.K. Brooks contributed three scores on the ground for the Raiders, part of an 11-carry, 50-yard night. Trailing 49-0 at halftime, Pope got the ball first to start the third quarter, and outplayed Walton for the rest of the game.“I told them at half, I don’t have anything in the playbook that can get us 49 points in one play,” Pope coach Kyle Adkins said. “All I could ask them to do is go out and win the next two quarters, and they sort of embraced that.”Adkins inserted backup quarterback Campbell Rickers into the game in the second half, and he led the Greyhounds on a field-goal drive near the end of the third quarter, getting Pope on the board at 49-3 after Carson Mistretta converted the 23-yard kick. Despite the large deficit, Rickers continued to move Pope’s offense in the fourth quarter, connecting on multiple pass plays with receiver Zack Owens. With less than a minute to play, Rickers found Owens in the middle of the field for a 79-yard gain, setting up first-and-goal at the 1-yard line. One play later, Rickers found Galt Robertson for the Greyhounds’ only touchdown of the night, with only 9 seconds left on the clock. “There’s going to come a time when these 14-year-old kids aren’t 14 anymore,” Adkins said about his team’s youth. “They’re just going to have to look at things in the big picture, and that’s just the way it is.”Owens finished the game with five catches for 124 yards, helping Rickers accumulate 145 yards passing.
