The Tigers recovered, and quarterback Seth Currens made the Panthers pay on the next play when he connected with Terry Simuel on a 39-yard touchdown pass. \nFrom there, the Tigers continued to roll up points in the 37-7 victory Friday night and improved to 4-2 overall and 2-1 in the Ohio Capital Conference Ohio Division. \n“That was a big momentum changer right then,” said Currens, who threw back-to-back second-half touchdown passes. “We came out and everything just happened to flow our way.” \nCurrens’ 13-yard touchdown pass to Trenton Gillison with 4:07 left in the third quarter gave the Panthers a 23-0 lead. The steady rain and sloppy conditions didn’t seem to bother Currens, who was 7-of-11 passing for 91 yards. \n“Our guys didn’t get rattled and kept their feet on the ground and kept pounding and got that 30-point lead,” Central coach Jay Sharrett said. \nNoah Burk’s 87-yard touchdown run widened Central’s lead to 30-7 with 11:21 to play. He rushed for 147 yards on 17 carries and scored twice. \nThe Tigers, who rushed for 271 yards on 41 carries, got another big gain and touchdown to complete the scoring when JerMycole Graham ran 42 yards with 6:56 left. \nNorth’s offensive production, which was hampered by four turnovers and penalties, finished with just 123 total yards. At halftime, the Panthers had only 14 yards total yards with 3 yards rushing. \nNorth didn’t reach the end zone until Michael Lowery’s threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Alex Morgan with 26 seconds left in the third quarter to make it 23-7. \n“It was (Central’s) night,” said North coach Tom Phillips, whose team dropped to 3-3 and 1-1. “ We beat ourselves a lot throughout the entire game. We made too many mistakes with penalties and turnovers. You can’t beat a team like Central with mistakes like that.” \nThe two schools have met 10 times with Central leading the all-time series 7-3. The Tigers won 30-23 in overtime in last year’s contest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T11:38:27.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
