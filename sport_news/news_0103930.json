The 37 points have them positioned as the 27th-ranked team in the country. \n“They’re a very good team,” Jones said. “We were talking about as a team that this is a great game to get up for. They’re nationally ranked, they’ve only lost one game in three years in conference.” \nSo how can Lincoln change its misfortunes against Indianapolis? Jones said the team needs to find a way to play a complete game and overcome adversity. \n“You still have to go play-by-play, and that’s what we’re not doing,” Jones said. “We’re not making plays on a consistent basis. We’ll put three or four plays together and then we’ll have a bad play. So, we just need to eliminate the bad plays and be more consistent.” \nJones is looking forward to hosting a talented team coming off a long road trip. \n“They’re going to have a little bit of a bus lag, hopefully,” he said. “We have to play with emotion, play with enthusiasm and understand that this is the best team in our conference right now. So you want to see how you measure against the best in your conference, and I’m excited about playing them.” \nThe Greyhounds like to run first, and they do so with back Andrew Walker, who has racked up 571 rushing yards and seven touchdowns. The sophomore is the second leading rusher in the GLVC behind Bubba Jenkins of Southern Baptist. \n“You have to figure out what phase of the game you can stop,” Jones said. “We know they want to run the ball. If they can run the football, they’re going to have you on your heels all game because they can run play-action, and they can drop back. We have got to be stout in stopping the run.” \nIndianapolis wide receiver Reece Horn has caused fits for GLVC defenses so far this season, as he leads the conference with 843 receiving yards. On top of that, Horn is second among active Division II players in career receiving yards with 3,009. The senior is 246 receiving yards away from topping the all-time Indianapolis receivers list. \nThrowing the ball to Horn is three-year starting quarterback Connor Barthel. Last season against the Blue Tigers, the two-time All-GLVC selection had almost as many touchdowns as incompletions when he converted 23-of-28 passes for four scores. \nLincoln’s passing game, meanwhile, has a wide-receiver corps that has evolved into a balanced group. Senior quarterback Owen Jordan has spread it out to the junior trio of Darius Hicks, Bryson Winfrey and Delvon Rouser, who all rank in the top seven in the conference in receptions. Rouser has 38 catches for 441 yards, while Winfrey has 37 receptions for 317 yards. Hicks leads the Blue Tiger receivers with 468 yards on 35 catches. \n“(Jordan) does a good job including everybody,” Jones said. “As a quarterback, if you have a No. 1 receiver like Hicks or (Winfrey), sometimes you’ll lean on those guys. … We expect them to do well. Owen’s done a great job of getting the ball to those guys. That speaks volumes of a quarterback.” \nThe Greyhounds don’t turn the ball over much. In fact, Indianapolis is tied for first in Division II for fewest giveaways with four. Prior to some stumbles in last week’s 26-20 win against Quincy, the Greyhounds had committed just one turnover. \nIndianapolis likes to create turnovers and turn them into points, as the Greyhounds are the GLVC scoring defense leaders. The Blue Tigers lead the league in turnovers with 19. Jones said his team will have to execute better this week than in past weeks to top the Greyhounds. \n“You look across the board and this is a veteran club, and you know we’re young,” he said. “It’s going to come down to us executing, sticking to what we’re doing, because Indianapolis is not going to change. They are going to be who they are.” \nThe game is set to kick off at 2 p.m. at Dwight T. Reed Stadium. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:26:53.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
