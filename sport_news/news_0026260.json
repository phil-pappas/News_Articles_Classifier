However, his condition is reported to be stable. \"Mr Navjot Singh Sidhu was admitted to Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals Delhi today evening with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This is a life threatening condition if not treated on time. Mr Sidhu has been put on blood thinners and has been recovering well. His condition is said to be stable as of now,\" said a statement issued by Indraprastha Apollo Hospital authorities. DVT is caused by a blood clot in a deep vein which hinders the normal blood flow. The symptoms may include swelling, pain, and tenderness, often in the legs. Sidhu tweeted about his condition later saying, \"Down but Not Out! Life threatening disease (DVT) With God's Grace will recover. Life is Fragile, handle with Prayer.\" Copyright Business Recorder, 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T20:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:19:14.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
