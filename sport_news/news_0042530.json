Travis d'Arnaud followed with a sacrifice fly, and Murphy homered in the sixth. \nJacob deGrom allowed runners in all six of his innings but just two runs. Noah Syndergaard pitched the seventh, and Jeurys Familia got the first six-out save of his career. \nDespite a record $289 million payroll, the Dodgers remained without a World Series title since 1988. Andre Ethier shouted at Dodgers manager Don Mattingly in the dugout in the third.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:29:10.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
