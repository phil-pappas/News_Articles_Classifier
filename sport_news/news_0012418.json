More information and reservation information can be found at GoXavier.com or by calling 513-745-3413. The new class will bring the total to 123 individuals that are honored in the P. Douglas O’Keefe Athletic Hall of Fame at Cintas Center and they are: \n-- Rob Bakker (‘00), who earned All-Atlantic 10 Conference honors in both tennis and soccer. \n-- Lionel Chalmers II (‘03), who was the point guard on the 2004 Xavier team that won four games in four days to capture the 2004 Atlantic 10 Championship and went on to the first NCAA Tournament Elite Eight appearance in school history. \n-- Karyn Juziuk-Kagel (‘99), who earned All-America honors in each of her four years and was a part of a national championship team in air rifle in 1996 and won the 1998 NCAA Individual Smallbore Rifle Championship. \n-- Jason Kokrak (‘07), who was a two-time Atlantic 10 Conference Golfer of the Year, helping XU reach three NCAA Tournaments. Kokrak has since solidified his spot on the PGA Tour. \n-- Nicole “Nikki” Kremer-Drew (‘99) , who earned First Team All-Atlantic 10 honors and guided XU to the second round of the 1999 NCAA Women’s Basketball Tournament, nearly shocking Connecticut at UConn before falling 86-84. \nHere is more on each of the inductees: \nRob Bakker Rob Bakker lettered four years in soccer and tennis, earning the distinction as the only Xavier student-athlete ever to earn all-conference honors in two major sports. Bakker, a two-time all-conference pick in soccer, earned First Team All-Atlantic 10 Conference as a senior. He was a three-time All-Atlantic 10 Conference selection in tennis and earned a spot on the Atlantic 10 Commissioner’s Honor Roll each of his four years on campus. Bakker scored a remarkable 45 points during his four seasons (13 goals, 19 assists) as a Musketeer on the soccer team, including a personal-best 17 points during his senior season. His 19 assists still rank seventh in Xavier history. \nLionel Chalmers \nLionel Chalmers had one of the most productive careers of any Xavier guard in school history and he saved his best for last. Chalmers, the 2004 Atlantic 10 Championship MVP, led Xavier to a historic four-game sweep of the tournament, which included a blowout of then-No. 1 and undefeated Saint Joseph’s and a win over host Dayton in the title game. The senior point guard led XU to wins over Louisville, Mississippi State and Texas on its way to the school’s first-ever NCAA Tournament Elite Eight appearance. Chalmers was named to the five-member All-NCAA Atlanta Regional Team after averaging a team-high 21.8 ppg. and dishing out 3.8 apg. for XU’s four NCAA Tournament games. Xavier won two Atlantic 10 Conference Regular Season Championships and two Atlantic 10 Conference Tournament Championships during his four-year career. XU made the NCAA Tournament in each of his four seasons, advancing to the 2004 Elite Eight and the NCAA Second Round twice. Chalmers stands 16th on Xavier’s all-time scoring list with 1,556 career points and ninth in assists with 405, but will likely be best remembered for his efforts in March of 2004. \nChalmers was drafted in the second round of the NBA Draft and played three seasons for three teams in the NBA before going overseas. He has completed 11 seasons in his pro career. \nKaryn Juziuk-Kagel \nKaryn Juziuk-Kagel was a four-time All-American in air rifle and a two-time All-American in smallbore. Juziuk is one of only three Xavier shooters to be honored with All-American honors all four years of their collegiate careers. She was a part of a national championship team in air rifle in 1996 and won the 1998 NCAA Individual Smallbore Rifle Championship. \nJuziuk was part of a Xavier Rifle team that participated in two NCAA Championships, placing first overall in Air Rifle in 1996 and sixth overall in combined the same year. The team also finished seventh in Juziuk’s senior season in the combined competition. The first place finish in the Air Rifle competition in 1996 is the only team title at the NCAA Championships in school history. Her first place title in smallbore at the 1998 championships makes her the only individual NCAA Champion in Xavier’s rifle history. Juziuk, who has served in the U.S. Army for 15 years and currently ranks as a Major, was a member of the US National Team while at Xavier and was recruited to shoot for the US Army Marksmanship Unit following graduation and earned the Army’s Distinguished Rifleman Badge. \nJason Kokrak Jason Kokrak can be found atop many of the Xavier golf records and was a part of three NCAA Tournament teams. Kokrak won Xavier player of the year in 2005-06 and 2006-07, sharing the honor with John Streibich. Kokrak was named to the Atlantic 10 All-Conference teams in 2003-04, 2004-05 and 2006-07 and was the Atlantic 10 Performer of the Year in 2004-05 and 2005-06 school years. \nKokrak competed in an NCAA regional each of his four years at Xavier, including once as an individual. Kokrak currently holds Xavier’s lowest career average and most rounds played in a career with 72.43 over 145.5 rounds. The Warren, Ohio native is second all-time with five individual championships in his career, including two Atlantic 10 Championships. Kokrak has since become Xavier’s first-ever PGA Tour member. \nNikki Kremer-Drew \nNicole “Nikki” Kremer-Drew was a two-time All-Atlantic 10 Conference selection and a two-time Xavier captain on the women’s basketball team. Her steady play at the point guard position earned her First Team All-Atlantic 10 honors her senior. Kremer’s 1998-99 season ranks as one of the top senior performances by a point guard in Xavier’s history. She averaged 8.9 apg., which ranked second in the nation during the 1998-99 campaign. It also established the all-time record at Xavier for a season assist average. For her career, Kremer averaged 5.3 apg., which is second on Xavier’s all time career list. Her 537 career assists place her second all-time in school history. \nDuring Kremer’s four years at Xavier, the Musketeers improved from a 15-13 team her freshman season to a NCAA second round team her senior year. She led her team to the WNIT first round in 1997-98, and followed that performance with a NCAA tournament bid at the end of the 1998-99 season. Xavier made it to the NCAA Second Round before losing at powerhouse Connecticut 86-84, as Kremer led her team in scoring with 23 points. Following graduation, Kremer became the first Xavier women’s basketball player to play professionally by signing a contract with Osnabrucker, Germany club team in the Bundesliga Damen league. \n*Information provided by Xavier.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:08:23.606+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
