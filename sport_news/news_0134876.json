The court has directed that the couple be allowed to live together within two months from the date of passing the order.\nThe 26-year-old man, in his complaint, claimed that he and the woman had eloped and got married in a temple in 2009. The couple had stayed together in Lonavala from February till June 2009, and then shifted to Colaba. \"When the two returned to Mumbai, the woman went to her maternal house. However, for unknown reasons, she refused to live with her husband. Further, when the man went to her house, asking her to come and stay with him, the woman's family approached the local police and filed a complaint against him for harassing them,\" read the order copy.\nHelpless and having failed to convince the woman's family, he finally approached the family court and filed a petition under the restitution of conjugal rights under the Hindu Marriage Act. The court, after going through the evidence, asked the woman to file a reply, but none came. The woman did not challenge the man's say. The court, because the petition went unopposed, then passed an order in favour of the man, thus holding his claim of the woman's family not allowing them to stay together as he belonged to a reserved caste to be true.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T13:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:13:40.037+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
