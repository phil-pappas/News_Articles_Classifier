The Seattle Seahawks and Dallas Cowboys, two teams expecting to play deep into January, have losing records.\nSix teams – New England Patriots, Green Bay Packers, Cincinnati Bengals, Denver Broncos, Carolina Panthers and Atlanta Falcons – are all unbeaten in a league defined by parity.\nAs usual, Sunday produced typical knee-jerk reactions and overreactions. Here's five and why they are off-base:\n1. Don't believe in Andy Dalton until he proves it in the playoffs.\nYes, Dalton needs to improve his 0-4 playoff record, and fast. But he's not the only quarterback dealing with playoff struggles. Let's give him credit for an outstanding start to his fifth NFL season. This isn't a game manager at quarterback. If his success continues, he's a dark horse MVP candidate. Dalton has 11 touchdown passes and just two interceptions. He's on pace to throw for more than 4,500 yards. He is accurate. He makes prudent decisions. And he remains upright. Dalton has a strong offensive line and an arsenal of skill position players as good as almost any team in the league. Tight end Tyler Eifert, who had two touchdowns in the comeback victory over Seattle, has been a major contributor.\n2. The Broncos will win big in spite of Peyton Manning.\nLet's not get carried away with ragging on Manning. Yes, the Broncos remain unbeaten because of their defense. Yes, the velocity on many of Manning's passes leaves a lot to be desired. And yes, it's striking to see that he has more interceptions (seven) than touchdowns (six). The Broncos should be formidable enough to emerge as AFC West champs. But if they are going to be a legitimate threat in the playoffs, Manning will need to play a more productive role, even at 39. He is going to have to become more of a game manager. And he likely will need to become more conservative. It would help if the Broncos find some success in the running game. Let's not finish off what may be the final chapter of Manning's career just yet. But he needs to continue to adjust in the latter stages of his career if the Broncos are to compete with the league's best.\nUSA TODAY\n50 things we learned in Week 5 of the NFL season\n3. Devonta Freeman is a nice little story, but it won't last -- and the 5-0 Falcons are a paper tiger.\nThis is not the season for a lot of notable running backs to shine. But there's enough of a sample size to see that Freeman is for real. In his last three games, Freeman has amassed 539 yards and seven touchdowns. In Sunday's overtime victory over the Washington Redskins, the 5-foot-8 Freeman rushed for 153 yards and caught seven passes for 44 yards. The scariest thing for the rest of the NFC is that we see that Matt Ryan and Julio Jones do not have to have remarkable days for the Falcons to win. First-year coach Dan Quinn has changed the culture and injected a Seattle-like edge into the emerging defense. What's more, other than two games against Carolina, the schedule could not be much softer. Barring something unforeseen, the Falcons should have a gaudy record, and count on Freeman playing a leading role in that success.\n4. Matt Cassel will cure the Cowboys' offensive woes.\nUh, no. The answers to the Cowboys' offensive struggles are Dez Bryant and Tony Romo. When Dallas plays again following its bye week – Oct. 25 at the New York Giants – it may be best to replace Brandon Weeden with the veteran Cassel. What do the Cowboys have to lose? The offense can't look much worse than it looked against the Patriots. But to think that the offense will dramatically come to life with Cassel at QB is misguided. Yes, he is a more accomplished quarterback than Weeden. And Weeden is both limited and mistake prone. But this offense just does not have enough playmakers with Bryant and running back Lance Dunbar (knee) sidelined. It has virtually no running game right now. Whether it's Weeden or Cassel at QB, the Cowboys will have a hard time beating almost any team. Jerry Jones must be counting the days until Nov. 22, the earliest Romo can return from his broken left collarbone.\n5. The Eagles are who we thought they were, and Chip Kelly is a genius again.\nNah, let's pump the brakes on that a bit, even after the 39-17 thrashing of the mostly hapless New Orleans Saints. The key part of that sentence was the following: New Orleans Saints. You can make the case that the Saints (if not the Texans) are the worst team in the league. If beating the Saints meant a whole lot this season, we'd be crowning the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. What Sunday showed was that it's premature to bury the Eagles. Let's not pencil in Kelly for the potential soon-to-be-open USC job just yet. They still have a pulse, especially in a division as middling as the NFC East, where nine wins might give you the outright division title. Sam Bradford still threw two interceptions in the red zone in the first half. At least DeMarco Murray finally had some success on the ground. But unless the Eagles beat the Giants next week, don't get too excited.\nFollow Eric Prisbell on Twitter @EricPrisbell\nVIDEO PLAYLIST: LATEST FROM THE NFL NFL Monday Hot Reads: What we learned in Week 5 | 02:27 USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero takes a look at the lessons learned from NFL Week 5.
