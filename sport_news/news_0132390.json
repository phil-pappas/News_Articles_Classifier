Shortly thereafter, manager Terry Collins told the media that Harvey had called and said he was stuck in traffic on the way to Citi Field. MLB postseason schedule, matchups, TV times \nHarvey eventually made it to the stadium and addressed the media without getting into specifics. \n\"Unfortunately, today I screwed up. There's not really anything else to say. They know what happened,\" Harvey said. \"I told everybody and apologized to everybody and told them it's not going to happen again. It's never happened before. Unfortunately, it happened kind of at a bad time, a mandatory time. Truly I just screwed up.\" \nCollins later said Harvey would be fined, but downplayed the day's events. \n\"This is minor. This isn't college, where he's going to miss the first quarter of a football game. I'm going to take care of it in-house,\" Collins said . \"He's going to get fined. It's no big deal. He (expletive) up. People do that. He feels bad.\" \nScheduled to start Game 3 against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Harvey was in the headlines for much of September, with talk surrounding whether or not he would pitch in the postseason. He and agent Scott Boras initially raised doubts on the matter, but after much consternation Harvey stated he would be pitching in October. \nThe 26-year-old missed all of 2014 after Tommy John elbow surgery. \nHarvey posted a 13-8 record with a 2.71 ERA and 188 strikeouts in 189 1/3 innings this season. \nPHOTOS: Players to watch in the postseason", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T00:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:42:26.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
