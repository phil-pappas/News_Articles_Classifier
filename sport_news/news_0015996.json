Oshie and Matt Niskanen also scored the Capitals, who welcomed back Ovechkin following a one-game disciplinary absence. \nComing off a 3-0 loss to Philadelphia one night earlier, the Blackhawks trailed by three goals in this one before Viktor Svedberg got his first goal of the season at 3:13 of the third period. That ended a scoreless drought of 107 minutes, 46 seconds for the defending Stanley Cup champions. \nOvechkin sealed the victory at 14:18, scoring from the left side of the net after a back-and-forth with teammate Evgeny Kuznetsov. \nOvechkin was benched Tuesday night in Washington's 5-0 loss to San Jose after missing practice that morning. He said he overslept after accidentally setting his alarm for 8:30 p.m. instead of 8:30 a.m. CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
