Again. No NIC-10 boys golf team has ever made it to state in Class 3A in the nine years of a three-class system, although Boylan won state in 2A in 2013. Monday was no different: Hononegah (318) and Boylan (331) finished 11th and 12th in the loaded 12-team field. Lake Forest shot 1-over-par (289) despite a three- to four-club wind to win at Elliot, while Barrington (293) and Linconshire Stevenson (298) also advanced. Eight teams shot 306 or better, an average of 76.5 strokes per man. No local individuals advanced, either. The three closest were Hononegah’s Varun Menon (76) and Reid Anderson (77), and Harlem’s Marty Schwebke (78). “We had a shot here at Elliot to go downstate, a course you grew up on,” Anderson said. “You figure you have an advantage and you don’t get the job done. “I’ve been close, really close, three of the past four years, and to not get over the hump hurts.” Anderson, the regional champ, could have been in a large playoff for the final individual spot if he would have parred the final two holes for a 75. Everyone was playing No.17 as a four-club wind —“All four of our bags got thrown because it was so windy on that hole,” Menon said — but Anderson “bombed” a 4-iron on the 182-yard hole over the green. “A 4-iron could easily have been the club,” Anderson said, “but if you hit one really crisply, it just slides through the wind. That’s what happened on mine.” Menon, the NIC-10 champ, hit one into the water for a double-bogey on 10 to go five-over, but played his last eight holes in 1-under to miss the playoff by a stroke. “I almost gave up, but I fought,” Menon said. “It was so tough in the wind. Some holes would take off 30 yards and others added 30 yards, and still others you’d hit it far left and hope it faded.” No Boylan golfer played badly, but none played super-well either. Nick Lunnon led the Titans with an 82; three others shot 83. “It played out like that for the whole season,” he said. “We tried our best, but in the end we didn’t really get it done.” The happiest NIC-10 golfer was Schwebke. The Harlem junior tied for 11th at conference and ninth among NIC-10 golfers at regionals but had the third-lowest local score at sectionals. “It feels like I’m on top of the world,” he said. “I know I didn’t catch everybody at their best, but I could have played better too. They are all my buddies too, so I am going to pick on them a lot afterward.” Page 2 of 2 - Class 2A None of Freeport’s four individual qualifiers made it out of the tightly bunched Freeport Sectional at Park Hills West. The lowest score of 112 golfers was a 76, and two who shot 79 lost in a playoff and didn’t advance to state. Ian McLain led Freeport with an 89.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:07:12.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
