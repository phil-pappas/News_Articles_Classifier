Former Gators’ coach Steve Spurrier was 5-1 against LSU in Tiger Stadium from 1991 through 2001 and 2-0 as a quarterback from 1964-66. \nFirst-year Florida head coach Jim McElwain, who was 1-1 at Tiger Stadium as Alabama’s offensive coordinator from 2008-11, sounded like a tourist as he looked forward to No. 6 LSU (5-0, 3-0 Southeastern Conference) hosting his No. 8 Gators (6-0, 4-0 SEC) at 6 p.m. Saturday on ESPN. \n“There are not a lot of people in life that get to go play in this kind of environment on a Saturday night and should be a great time,” McElwain said on the SEC teleconference Wednesday. “I’ve been fortunate enough to go in there. Man it’s great.” \nIn McElwain’s first game in Tiger Stadium, No. 1 Alabama defeated No. 15 LSU, 27-21, in overtime on its way to the SEC West title. The No. 12 Tigers knocked off the No. 5 Crimson Tide, 24-21, in 2010. \n“I’ve been telling my guys who haven’t been in there at night how much fun it is,” McElwain said. “The biggest thing for us is how we handle our business and how we go about our business.” \nThe Gators have performed well on the road so far, winning 14-9 at Kentucky on Sept. 19 and winning at Missouri, 21-3, last week. But McElwain knows Tiger Stadium, which is expected to be at its capacity of 102,321, is a level above most venues for the home team. \nMcElwain, who was the quarterback at Sentinel High in Missoula, Montana, in the late 1970s before playing quarterback at Eastern Washington, compared playing at Tiger Stadium to playing against Butte High in Butte, Montana, in a good way. \n“When you’re going on the bus down that one way road going into Tiger Stadium and all the people on the side, it reminded me of going in when you’re playing Butte, Montana,” he said. “These LSU people, they rock the bus. It’s great. It’s the way college football should be. The passion of the fans and the energy in the stands. What a great environment it was. Shoot, that’s why you get into this business.” \nHe is expecting more fans in Baton Rouge than in Butte. \n“Well, let’s put it this way,” he said. “There were a lot more people in Baton Rouge at the game (in 2008 and ’10) than there was in Butte. It is those same kind of memories that makes what we do a good time. The passion is what I probably remember the most.” \nIf Florida is to play well or win in Tiger Stadium, it will likely have to do so with defense. McElwain has not yet been able to put his offensive mark on the Gators yet as he did at Alabama. Florida is just 10th in the SEC in total offense with 384 yards a game, 12th in rush offense with 138.7 yards a game and seventh in pass offense with 246 yards a game. And McElwain will be minus his starting quarterback as freshman Will Grier was suspended for the season on Monday after testing for performance enhancing drugs. \nGrier was sixth in the SEC in passing efficiency through six games with a 145.4 rating. Florida will now start sophomore Treon Harris, a dual-threat who started six games last season but was beaten out by Grier this season. \n“He has experience,” McElwain said. “What I was most impressed with was how he was competitive this week, and our team responds to him. It allows us to maybe do some different things from a package standpoint.” \nMcElwain also had to suspend backup defensive back Deiondre Porter after a series of felony charges. \n“It should be a great challenge,” McElwain said. “We’ll see how our guys respond with all the stuff’s that’s going on around here. It should be a great learning experience for all our guys, and as I told them, ‘Let’s embrace this opportunity.’” \nAnother part of that challenge is LSU tailback Leonard Fournette, who leads the nation with 1,022 yards on the season and with 204.4 yards a game. \n“Well, I know I couldn’t tackle him,” McElwain said with a laugh. “I told our guys, ‘Somebody jump on his back.’ Maybe that will slow him down. Maybe somebody else grabs his shoelace and he trips.” \nFlorida’s defense will be the best LSU has seen. The Gators are second in the SEC and 12th nationally against the run with just 99.2 yards allowed a game. Florida is also second in the SEC and 18th nationally in pass efficiency defense with a 104.87 rating. LSU quarterback Brandon Harris may have to follow the best game of his career last week – 18 of 28 for 228 yards and two touchdowns – with something similar. \n“Well, he’s got a great command of what they’re doing,” McElwain said of Harris. “Great decisions. They take care of the football. They play the game the way it’s supposed to be played. He’s got a great arm and then beat you with his feet as well. This will be fun. Very excited about the opportunity to go into a great place to play at night against a team that obviously is as good as anyone in the country. This will be fun.” Read or Share this story: http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/sports/2015/10/15/new-florida-coach-sounds-like-tourist-visiting-lsu/73981370/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:13:19.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
