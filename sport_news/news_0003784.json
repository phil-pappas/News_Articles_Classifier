(Getty Images) By Michael Tunison \nThere's never a good time for a running back to tear his Achilles. It's especially sad to see it happen in the waning minutes of a blowout loss. Unfortunately, that's what happened today to Texans running back Arian Foster. \nWith about four minutes remaining in the fourth quarter of Houston's 44-26 defeat to Miami, the Texans offense was in the red zone trying to make the day look better on paper by adding a garbage time score. That's when Foster planted awkwardly on his right foot coming out of the backfield; his leg gave out and he immediately went to the ground. \nIt was reported not long after the game confirmed that the injury would end Foster's season. He missed the first three weeks of the season with a preseason groin injury. Since his return, Foster struggled -- as has been the norm for the Texans in 2015 -- putting up no more than 53 rushing yards in a game and averaging only 2.3 yards per carry. Source: #Texans RB Arian Foster has, in fact, torn his Achilles. His season is over. &mdash; Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) October 25, 2015 \nIt will be the second time in the past three seasons that Foster has missed significant time due to injury. In 2013, Foster missed eight games because of a back ailment. The former 1,000-yard per season rusher will turn 30 years just before the start of the 2016 season. While it's certainly possible for him to bounce back and be productive, it's fair to wonder whether that will be the case this time. \n* * * Mike Tunison is a freelance writer based in Alexandria, Va.
