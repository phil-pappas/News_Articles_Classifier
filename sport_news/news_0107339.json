Texas won in the total bases department (12-9) and on the scoreboard.\nThe Jays’ Mount Crushmore of Jose Bautista, Josh Donaldson and Edwin Encarnacion, which combined for 64 homers after the all-star break — more than the team totals of the Atlanta Braves, Miami Marlins and Milwaukee Brewers — managed one long ball by Bautista, who didn’t play the ninth due to leg cramps.\nEncarnacion had a pair of singles and Donaldson had only two at-bats before sliding into the one-man wrecking crew named Rougned Odor.\nIt was Game 1 of the best-of-five American League Division Series and it was quite unlike the first 162 games of the Jays’ season.\nDavid Price could retire the Rangers’ No. 8 and No. 9 hitters only twice of the six times he faced them. All in all it was a different kind of Jays team people are used to seeing.\n“It was a weird one,” said Justin Smoak, who gave Donaldson a post-game concussion test by holding up two fingers and asking: “How many hands am I holding up?”\nSmoak said Donaldson answered: “One hand, two fingers.”\n“We had some bad breaks,” said Brett Cecil, who pitched a scoreless eighth. “We need everyone healthy for Game 2.”\nAnd it appears as if both Donaldson and Bautista will play Game 2.\nBen Revere put the game down to rust.\n“Neither team had played in four days,” Revere said. “They found the holes, they got the key hits. Now we have to come back and win Game 2. We’ve got four more games.”\nNot if the Jays lose Friday facing lefties Cole Hamels or Sunday in Arlington against Martin Perez in Game 3?\n“Hey, we’ve won three games before,” said Revere.\nThe Jays possess a heavily lopsided lineup of right-handed hitters, led by Bautista, Donaldson and Encarnacion, who combined for 120 of the club’s 232 homers, most in the majors.\nThey’ll need offence and they’ll need young starter Marcus Stroman to continue his dominance to avoid heading deep into the heart of Texas down 2-0 in the series.\nNo Buck, No Tabby\nBuck Martinez and Pat Tabler did pre- and post-game shows on Sportsnet, but Canadian viewers saw the FOX game feed with Kenny Albert, former Seattle Mariners second base whiz Harold Reynolds and the multi-talented Tom Verducci of Sports Illustrated and the MLB Network, along with Ken Rosenthal.\nSportsnet tweeted to complaining fans, who wanted their Martinez-Tabler double play combo: “We hear you, fans! Buck & Pat are part of our pre/post game. Unfortunately @Sportsnet doesn’t have rights to produce @BlueJays postseason games.”\nRogers Communications does not have the post-season rights for the simple reason Rogers chose not to bid on the Jays games due to production costs, according to multiple sources.\nOne rally, one Ranger\nDyson the ex-Jay who learned how to improve on his sinker from pitching coach Tom Signore at double-A New Hampshire, set down the Jays in the ninth for his third career save. He has allowed one run in 16.1 innings over his past 17 appearances ... Dyson faced one batter in his debut for the Jays on July 5, 2012, against the Kansas City Royals and 12 days later against the New York Yankees allowed three runs in a third of an inning. Jayson Nix singled, Chris Stewart and Derek Jeter each doubled, Curtis Granderson singled, Mark Teixeira walked and Alex Rodriguez hit a run-scoring ground ball. And that was it for Dyson’s Jays days.\nAINT NO SUNSHINE\nThe roof of the concrete clam was closed on Thursday — just as it was for all previous 28 post-season games. The decision to close the roof and keep it closed for the playoffs was first made in 1989, leading up to the Jays’ AL Championship Series against the Oakland A’s. Worried that the roof of the three-month-old facility might jam while closing, Dr. Bobby Brown, then the AL president, made the decision it would remain closed for all games ... The largest post-season crowd the Blue Jays have enjoyed was for Game 6 of the 1993 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies when 52,268 attended. Due to the re-configured seating of the Rogers Centre the sell-out crowd of 49,834 on Thursday was the smallest post-season number ever.\n23-for-23\nESPN’s panel of experts — 23 in all — all chose the Blue Jays to beat the Texas Rangers in the ALDS. Included in the select group of 23 were Adnan Virk, who grew up in Morven, Ont., outside of Kingston, Canada’s first capital, and Montreal’s Jonah Keri.\nWatching their guys\nThe Rogers Centre was full, packed with relatives and friends of the big leaguers on the carpet. But not one household has taken in more Blue Jays than Jana and Bill Maclagan’s Oakridge neighbourhood in Vancouver. They have been billeting class-A Vancouver Canadians for the past nine years and Blue Jays farmhands for the past five. Outfielders Dalton Pompey (2012), relievers Roberto Osuna (2012) and Aaron Sanchez (2011), and starter Marcus Stroman (2012) all were at Nat Bailey Stadium by night and headed to the Maclagans after the game.\nPre-game notes\nAs a tribute to the late Michael Burgess, who sang O Canada before Game 1 of the 1992 World Series in Atlanta, and who passed away this Sept. 28 after a battle with cancer, the Jays played a taped version of his rendition of our anthem from that night in Georgia. Burgess sang the anthem each year at induction ceremonies in St. Marys at the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. He attended Regiopolis College in Kingston in 1962-63 ... Cito Gaston, who managed the Jays for 12 seasons, including the 1992 and ’93 World Series teams, threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Mark Buehrle made like J.P. Arencibia and scooped the ball out of the dirt ... Former Cy Young Award winner Pat Hentgen will throw the first pitch before Game 2.\nStars in the crowd\nHockey Hall of Famer Wayne Gretzky, like when he showed for Game 6 of the World Series in 1992 in Atlanta ... Toronto Argos Hall of Famer Michael (Pinball) Clemons, the city’s happiest, most upbeat man, wearing a No. 32 Roy Halladay jersey ... Kingston’s Don Cherry was on hand to lend insight to the pre-game show and blasted commissioner Rob Manfred for not opening the dome.\nESPN Stats and stuff\nTeams that win Game 1 of a best-of-five win a series 71.6% of the time (83-33) ... At 21, Odor is youngest Ranger and youngest second baseman with a post-season homer. Odor was also the second youngest to score three runs in a post-season game. Only Andruw Jones in the 1996 World Series was younger ... Price did not hit a batter in the regular season while pitching for the Jays, but he hit Odor twice ... Price is the only pitcher in history to lose his first six career post-season starts. Only Hall of Famer Randy Johnson with seven losses has a longer streak ... Robinson Chirinos, who hit a two-run homer off Price, had one in his last 17 regular-season games.\nScout and about\nJohn Hendricks was promoted to national pitching crosschecker by the New York Mets.\nHe was a Blue Jays area scout in the Carolinas before resigning in 2013.\nSong of the day\nDoris Day’s Is That All There Is?\nDeepest sympathies\nDoug Smith, former Toronto Sun desker, buried his father George Smith, 82, in Niagara Falls on Thursday.
