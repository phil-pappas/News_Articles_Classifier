PROUDLY PRIDE: Jason Roos and Brett Anderson want the Pride to keep their current title. Source: News Corp Australia \nBAFFLED and enraged former Northern Pride captains will today present a united objection to any potential­ name change of their beloved­ club. \nAs revealed in The Weekend Post , directors of the Intrust Super Cup club are toying with the idea of rewriting­ nine years of history by altering­ the Pride’s title. \nIt’s thought including the word “Cairns” would enable the club to cash in on additional corporate avenues while creating stronger ties with the city in which they are housed. \nThe fear, however, would be alienating the rest of the Far North, a region­ the Pride have strongly represented and inject plenty of effort and resources into. \nThe mere suggestion of a name change has sparked varying ideas from fans and players, though the Pride’s former captains are adamant where they stand. \nJason Roos (Mareeba), Brett Anderson­ (Innisfail), Mark Cantoni (Malanda), Chris Sheppard (Mareeba), Ty Williams (Innisfail) and Chey Bird will today hold a phone hook-up in order to channel their thoughts. \nFew are as passionate about the club as Roos, a foundation player in 2008 who holds the Pride’s highest number of games record before hanging up the boots at the end of the 2015 season. \n“I think it’s called the Northern Pride because it’s not just Cairns,” Roos said. \n“You have got players from Atherton, Mareeba, Normanton and everywhere else. \n“I wouldn’t agree with a name change. \n“All the older boys feel if you change the name it will be a different club and will not be the one we played for. \n“We’ll definitely be taking our concerns to the club.” \nWith membership numbers dropping to just 82 and crowds following suit, Pride directors insisted a name change could revitalise the region. \n“I don’t see how a name change can fix things off the field,” Roos said. \n“You can’t blame a name on having no members. \n“If you didn’t know who the Northern Pride are now, after two premierships and a national title, you never will. \n“There’s an old saying about never changing the name of a boat because it’s bad luck.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:04:30.237+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
