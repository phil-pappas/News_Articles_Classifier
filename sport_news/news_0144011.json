(Photo: Andrew Vaughan / Associated Press) \n2 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Detroit — Mike Babcock and his former players agree, it was time for him to move on.\nBut their respect for him is clear. And he made his respect for them plain as he stood before the media last spring as the new coach of the Maple Leafs, who are in town for an exhibition today and who come back for the Red Wings home opener Oct. 9.\nCoaches and players do not always get along. In some ways, the nature of the relationship suggests they will not.\nIt is fairly autocratic.\nHe decides how much ice time they get, regardless of Babcock’s protestations they make the decision based on the way they play. That issue alone, and the persistent juggling of lines in search of better play, is enough to frustrate players.\nAs intense a man as one is likely to meet, Babcock is not an easy companion over the course of a long season, let alone 10.\nBut they won, and he never caused them the degree of public anguish John Tortorella or Mike Keenan sometimes spurred in New York City, Vancouver or Philadelphia.\nMeanwhile, so often, the success under Babcock stemmed from an impressive degree of preparation, born of intensity.\nThat was the Babcock the denizens of Hockeytown encountered when his upstart Mighty Ducks shocked the Red Wings, sweeping them out of the first round in 2003.\nHe looked, even then, like a bit of a wild man, flashing that bird of prey scowl of his, eyes searing, reaching dramatically between his players to draw up Xs and Os on the top of the boards, prodding them, laying out a winning strategy, getting them all to buy in — as certainly they must, if there was any chance, at all, of winning.\nIt is that reality which veteran Red Wings lived for a decade.\nIt was good. It was intense. It is done.\nThey respect him.\nActually, they seem to like him mostly, even if they allow some reading between the lines that suggests life with Babcock did not always resemble Kumbaya moments around the campfire.\n“Obviously, it’s a big part of some of our careers; we had him for 10 years,” said Red Wings captain Henrik Zetterberg, who occasionally reined in his coach.\n“(Today) is the first time Mike comes back, but I think following Friday will be bigger.\n“The preparation was the first thing I noticed when he came in. Every day, practicing and before games. You knew the game plan before every game, the players. That was a step up from what I was used to before.\n“Just a level of competitiveness, I think, every day.”\nAsked to describe Babcock in a few words, Zetterberg paused and proclaimed it difficult.\nWhen it was suggested he might have trouble coming up with words polite enough for publication, he said, “That you can print?”\nAnd then he laughed, along with the media.\n“No, but I would just say that he is a competitive guy,” he said. “And I always come back to the preparation, the amount of hours he spent on hockey.\n“A lot of it was at the rink. But I don’t think that when he left the rink the off switch was off.”\nThe respect is there. It is abiding, and it argues against a notion, rampant at times among fans and others, that players steered clear of Detroit because they did not want to play for Babcock. That might have been true of some. To think it was anything approaching a pattern seems like conspiracy theory.\nEven Johan Franzen, about whom Babcock was likely more public with his criticism than any other player, is respectful.\nBut, Franzen also enjoyed a bit of a joke, at Babcock’s expense.\nAsked what he will think if he looks behind the visitor’s bench and sees Babcock, Franzen was passive-aggressive.\n“I usually don’t look at the coach who is behind the bench,” he said. “I might yell something!” he said, laughing.\n“No,” he then said, immediately.\n“I don’t think it will be weird. He’ll probably say hi, and then you skate on and just do your thing.”\nBabcock’s presence is likely to stoke a rivalry that has needed little more fuel since the first game, when the Toronto St. Patricks beat the Detroit Cougars, 2-1, on Jan. 4, 1927, before the nicknames of the fabled franchises were changed.\n“It’s exciting,” Franzen said. “It’s going to be maybe a little bit more noise for each game than usual. It’s going to be fun to have that competition going.”\nFor Jeff Blashill, a product, in part, of Babcock’s mentoring, the respect is profound.\nBabcock essentially broke the NHL template for hiring assistants when he tabbed Blashill, who had just begun coaching at Western Michigan.\n“Very good friendship with Mike,” Blashill said. “Tons of respect for him as a coach.\n“I think his approach is that when he’s serious, he’s serious. But around his family, in the summer, I think his wife would joke that that there’s a summer Mike and a winter Mike — and they’re just different.”\nBlashill said the idea of having more fun coaching against and beating Babcock is not on his agenda.\n“I’ve coached against a lot of guys that I worked under,” he said. “I’ve coached against guys I’ve worked with. Those are friendships regardless of hockey, and who you’re coaching against doesn’t matter.\n“It’s how our team plays, and I’ll focus way more on ourselves.”\ngregg.krupa@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/greggkrupa", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T23:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:01:53.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
