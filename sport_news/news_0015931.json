Mauti was a New Orleans-area high school football player and part of the crowd that jammed the Superdome for its reopening after Hurricane Katrina, and he’d celebrated the Saints’ victory over the rival Falcons that night. A decade later, with Gleason watching from the sideline, Mauti blocked a punt against — of all teams — Atlanta, then scooped it up and scored to help the recently reeling Saints rebound with a stunning 31-21 upset of the previously unbeaten Falcons on Thursday night. “I was a fan of Steve Gleason. He’s a special-teams guy, and my dad played special teams,” Mauti, said, referring to his father, Rich, who also played for the Saints. “To do this is a dream come true. I’m going to meet (Gleason) as soon as a I can. He’s one of my heroes.” Gleason, now paralyzed by ALS, but world-renowned for the way he lives with his condition and his efforts to improve the lives of those similarly afflicted, was watching from his motorized, computer-equipped wheel chair. He reacted to Mauti’s big play with this Twitter post: “Hey, Falcons. #NeverPunt.” “The cool thing was that Steve was here to see that,” said Saints quarterback Drew Brees, who was Gleason’s teammate and remains his good friend. “It brought back some good memories. Obviously we got to add to that tonight as well.” Mark Ingram scored on a pair of short runs for the Saints, and Watson added a fourth-down touchdown catch. The Falcons (5-1) were left to wonder why their punt protection broke down against New Orleans (2-4) when such plays seemed routine in their five previous games. “The mistakes were ones we executed before, so why did they come up tonight?” said first-year Falcons coach Dan Quinn, speaking for the first time after a loss. “For us to have those come up tonight is hard. I’m going to give a lot of credit to New Orleans, just in terms of the effort they played with. We knew it would be a battle.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:24:21.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
