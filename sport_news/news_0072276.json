On Wednesday at Mount Greylock, Mounties Tommy Kirby and Margo Smith jumped out to lengthy leads on their home course. However, when it's just yourself and the course, the duo said it's hard to keep the mental edge needed to run your best. \nLuckily for them, their leads were sizable enough to earn first-place finishes. Kirby finished in 13 minutes and 28 seconds, while Smith finished in 16:26. \n\"It's definitely a lot harder than having people pushing you,\" Smith said on running with the lead. \"But you have to race the watch and go after your best previous time. \n\"It takes [mental strength] because it's hard not to let up and relax. But at the same time there's always people behind you, so you have to pay attention.\" \nFor Kirby, he was one of two Greylock seniors racing on Senior Day. The sixth-year runner had the added difficulty of battling the emotions of racing his final race at his home course. \n\"It's such a mental sport, that without the competition there, it's really hard to push yourself to a fast time,\" he said. \nHe added that, while the mid-50 degree weather was perfect for running, the wind — especially running into the wind — presented a challenge as well.

Lee's Sam Harding finished eighth, helping the Wildcats earn dual victories against Wahconah (27-30), and Hoosac (20-37). The Braves won their dual against Wahconah 15-46, led by Mohammed Jadallah's 12th-place finish. \nGreylock placed seven girls in the top 10, leading to a 15-50 dual win over Taconic. Karli Manship's 13th-place finish helped Taconic get a 15-48 dual win over Lee. Wahconah's Gabbi and Danni Orlando placed fifth and sixth, respectively, giving the Warriors dual wins over Lee (15-50) and Hoosac (22-36). Jamie Barthe was Hoosac's highest finisher, placing fourth with a 17:48 time. \nWith the Western Massachusetts championships a month away, Kirby hopes to build off his fourth-place finish at Northfield from last season. Greylock's hilly course made Northfield's hills more manageable, but with the Western Mass. finals moving Stanley Park, the flat surface in Westfield offers a different set of challenges. \n\"I really like downhills, so [Greylock] is a really good course for me,\" he said. \"I'm a little disappointed that we don't get to run Northfield, but I like flats as well.\" \n———", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T13:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:04:26.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
