After watching her win titles even after battling with fitness issues I was also inspired to match her feats as a professional sportsman,\" Malik added.\n\"It is a healthy competition between husband and wife who are professional athletes. I credit my wife for my change in approach to training and my recent success and new international career,\" he said.\nThe former Pakistan captain said having a wife who is also an athlete made it easier for him to discuss sports related issues with her and seek advice.\nMalik said it was a gratifying feeling to score a century on his Test comeback.\n\"Even when I was dropped from the test squad I didn't give up hope and I focussed on the other formats and first class cricket and foreign leagues and I think all that prepared me for my Test comeback,\" he said.\nMalik was fortunate to get a call up for the first test since Pakistan's regular number three batsman Azhar Ali was ruled out of the test with a toe infection while leg spinner Yasir Shah also got injured during training a day before the test on Monday.\nMalik admitted that he had steeled himself physically and mentally to make the most of his opportunities that now come his way.\n\"I am training harder now and I focus more. Playing a Test match after such a long time is never easy for anyone. But the rewards are worth this pressure,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:07:24.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
