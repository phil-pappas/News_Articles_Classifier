We are hoping. We are just beginning talks.”\nThere’s absolutely no arguing Russell is a top-four defenceman who epitomizes the heart and work ethic the Flames success was built upon last year.\nBut this could be tricky, if not impossible.\nAfter being unable to stick as a core defenceman in Columbus or St. Louis, Russell was gifted by the St. Louis Blues to the Flames in a minor trade that has paid off handsomely for both sides.\nRussell is obviously in line for a major raise from the US$2.6 million he’ll make this year — the final year of his deal before he can test unrestricted free agency.\nBut given the financial commitments made to Giordano, Dougie Hamilton, Dennis Wideman, TJ Brodie (all over $4.6 million annually) and the pending deals needed to keep Johnny Gaudreau, Sean Monahan and, eventually, Sam Bennett in town, can the Flames afford to pay Russell anywhere near the market value his play would demand?\nSimilarly-aged unrestricted free-agent defencemen Andrej Sekera and Jeff Petry inked six-year deals worth $5.5 million annually this summer, and neither comes even remotely close to boasting the stats Russell just put up.\nWith the current trend revolving around teams striving hard to lock up top-four defencemen, consider the deals inked by the Chicago Blackhawks’ Brent Seabrook (eight years at $6.87 million per), the Colorado Avalanche’s Erik Johnson (seven years at $6 million per) and the Edmonton Oilers’ unproven Oscar Klefbom (seven at $4.16 million per).\nFew positions are more coveted these days than top blueliners such as Russell, and teams are loathe to let them hit free agency.\nAnd this is Russell’s time to cash in, meaning he’ll be looking for significant term.\nComplicating matters is the likelihood the salary cap won’t go up again next year.\nHowever, Flames fans need to cling to the belief where there’s a will there’s a way.\nGiordano left a considerable amount of money on the table in his massive deal, and Treliving is hoping other core Flames players such as Russell will do the same to stay in Cowtown.\n“I love playing here,” said Russell, who was born and raised in nearby Caroline. “From the owners on, it’s an incredible place to play and a real family. I think I found a place where I impact the team on a nightly basis, and, as a player, you want that. I was given every opportunity in my previous two places, but my game was still growing and evolving.”\nSafe to say he’s found his game.\nNow we’ll see where he finds his home for the foreseeable future.\n“Obviously, you want to be signed before free agency. It’s something that would be great to be done. But at the same time, I have to take care of my end and do my job. I feel like they want me, and I’m a part of this team.”\nTreliving confirmed his desire to keep Russell in town, saying, “he embodies everything we are all about in Calgary.”\nBut the GM will have to do some pretty fancy footwork — or make some significant trades — to make it happen.\nIf he can do that, Treliving will also deserve some sort of award.\neric.francis@sunmedia.ca\ntwitter.com/EricFrancis\nEric Francis\nCalgary Flames begin negotiations with defenceman Kris Russell\nBy Eric Francis , Calgary Sun First posted: Saturday, October 03, 2015 05:26 PM EDT | Updated: Saturday, October 03, 2015 10:14 PM EDT\nHaving broken the NHL record for blocked shots last year, Kris Russell was asked what such an award would look like if it existed.\n“Maybe a new set of shin pads,” smiled the Calgary Flames humble rearguard who impeded the progress of 283 vulcanized bullets over 79 games.\nOh, he’ll get much more than that for his efforts.\nThe question is how to reward someone with that distinction?\nHow do you compensate someone who essentially sacrificed his body more than any other NHLer while adding 34 points, finishing plus-18 and being universally loved and respected as a dressing-room leader?\nHow do you determine the worth of a player who was a central figure in filling the void left when captain Mark Giordano went down last year and may very well have been the Flames best player in the first round of the playoffs?\nAbout the author Eric Francis Other Stories LIVE: Vancouver Canucks at Calgary Flames\nIt will be the talk of the hockey world once the season starts.\n0\nCalgary Flames rugged forward Micheal Ferland sees how other half lives on top line\nWhen last we saw Micheal Ferland, he was banging and crashing so dynamically he attracted the attention of not only Kevin Bieksa and Jim Rome but a few sign-toting Calgarians who wanted him to run for mayor.\n0\nSee more from Eric Francis »\n ", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "https://twitter.com/EricFrancis", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-04T05:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:34:33.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
