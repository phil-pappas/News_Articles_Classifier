(Photo: Larry McCormack / The Tennessean) 53 CONNECT 10 TWEET LINKEDIN 7 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWhen you look at the recent arrest history involving NFL players, it’s an ugly laundry list of offenses. \nThe most recent 10 arrests include allegations of sexual battery, hit and run, DUI, vandalism, possessing drug paraphernalia with intent to use, domestic assault, resisting arrest, driving 143 mph with a 12-year-old boy in the car while street racing, discharging a firearm in public, burglary and aggravated animal cruelty. \nIt’s an epidemic in the league, and shows no signs of letting up. \nThat made me fear the worst when I saw the headline on Tuesday, “Dorial Green-Beckham arrested during traffic stop.” The former Hillcrest High and Mizzou star receiver was arrested in Van Buren last Wednesday, when he was pulled over for speeding and held because of an unpaid speeding ticket. \nAlmost on cue came the strong takes from people who want DGB tossed from the NFL and into a jail cell. We’ve heard from readers asking how many chances he will get, how much will be too much or why there isn’t going to be any punishment from the NFL or the Tennessee Titans. \nThis obviously isn’t the first time DGB has been involved with the legal system. But it’s also wise to point out that being pulled over for going 65 mph in a 55 mph zone isn’t exactly a capital offense. Especially in Van Buren, where it is very easy to miss the speed limit drop and get caught a few miles over the limit. \nHaving an outstanding warrant for speeding in Osage Beach isn’t reason to fit him for a jail jumpsuit and put his NFL career on hold. He was issued a warning for speeding and paid $92.48 to settle the ticket. That won’t get Homeland Security or any current-day Elliot Ness involved in the case. \nYou’d be hard-pressed to find anyone who has never exceeded the speed limit, and who hasn’t forgotten to pay an obligation. It’s non-news. \nScratch that. It’s a non-news story if it was someone like fellow Titans rookie Marcus Mariota, who has, by all accounts, walked the straight and narrow for his entire life. \nWhen you have legal issues in DGB’s past that led to him being suspended during his freshman season, then later dismissed from Mizzou, it is something that is going to be reported. And it is going to attract some attention. \nThank goodness the Titans are taking the reasonable stance on this, that it’s not a big issue and there will be no team punishment forthcoming. \nWhen you look at the legal problems facing NFL players these days, it’s obvious to any rational person where this fits into the mix. \nDGB went 65 mph in a 55 mph zone. And he forgot to pay an outstanding speeding ticket. \nThat could happen to any of us, when you’re going through such busy and hectic moments in your life, like getting ready for the NFL Draft, participating in the NFL Combine, visiting professional teams, then being drafted, getting acclimated to the NFL, moving to a new city, becoming a new father, and all of the things that he has gone through in the last 10 months. \nConsider this another lesson to be learned, but a pretty harmless one. \nLook at the things Green-Beckham didn’t. No sexual battery, no DUI, no hit and run, no drug charges, no domestic assault, no street racing and resisting arrest, no aggravated animal cruelty. \nHere’s hoping nothing like that happens to DGB in the future. If it does, then it will be time to cue the outrage. \nBut being pulled over for speeding, and arrested for a warrant on an unpaid speeding ticket? This is the time to cue the shoulder-shrugging. \nJim Connell is the News-Leader’s Sports Engagement Editor.
