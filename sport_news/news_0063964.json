It's just crazy to think I'm now a three-time world champion... Lewis Hamilton \nThe Briton prevailed in a breathless, frenetic and wildly unpredictable US race - and with Mercedes team mate Nico Rosberg beating Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel to second, earned an unassailable lead in the standings. \n\"It's difficult to find the words really. I owe it all to my dad and family who supported me all these years and sacrificed so much,\" Hamilton said afterwards. \"It's a very humbling experience, especially to equal Ayrton Senna [on three world titles] - I feel very blessed today. \n\"It's the greatest moment of my life. I pushed and pushed - I hope I can inspire people to never give up. It's just crazy to think I'm now a three-time world champion.\" \nHamilton admitted there were several occasions where he thought his chance of victory was over, particularly after dropping to fourth at mid-distance and then losing the advantage to Rosberg late on. \n\"Today so many times I thought I had lost the race,\" he said. \"Nico was really quick in stages, he pitted under the Virtual Safety Car…but never for one second did I think I couldn't do it. \n\"I'm buzzing inside… I can't find the right words to express the feeling but it's the greatest I've had in my life. Nico drove a fantastic race, mad respect for him as a team mate. I just can't believe I'm sitting here. To my family, I love you. To the team, thank you so much - I'm overdue a drink with the team!\" Recommended", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:39:39.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
