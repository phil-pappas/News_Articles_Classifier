No surprise. It doesn't fit with his live-in-the-moment message to his players.\nBut for a Cowboys team operating with three consecutive losses, a backup quarterback and a defense that has been victimized for 95 points over the last three games, the similarities are striking.\nThe date was Nov. 8, 2010, when owner Jerry Jones fired Wade Phillips and dumped a 1-7 team in Garrett's lap. He inherited a team with a 38-year-old backup quarterback who hadn't won an NFL game in nearly three years -- Tony Romo was out with a fractured collarbone that year as well -- a beat-up offensive line and a defense that had allowed 114 points in its previous 11 quarters.\nText messages went out to players soon after the change that it would be a good idea to arrive at the club's Valley Ranch facility by 6:30 a.m. for a 7 a.m. meeting. Anyone who thought Garrett wasn't serious about a new day got the hint when he closed the doors to the first full team meeting two minutes before it was scheduled to begin.\nPlayers practiced in full pads that day for the first time since training camp. They were required to run from one drill to the next, not walk or jog. There were no card games during the team's afternoon break, no domino marathons as there had been all season, as Garrett tried to rekindle the team's competitive flame and focus its resolve.\nHis overarching message was boiled down to three words: It starts now. Garrett spoke of looking forward, not back. He spoke of discipline and accountability and stacking one good day on top of another.\nThe Cowboys then went on the road and beat the New York football Giants, as Garrett repeatedly referred to them that week, by a score of 33-20. Afterward, linebacker Bradie James presented the coach he called \"the Princeton redhead'' with the game ball.\nGarrett's culture has had time to take root since then. There's no need for dramatic changes entering this weekend's game with the Giants. He will continue to emphasize the same approach, the same message, that he delivered his first day on the job.\n\"Adversity is inevitable,'' Garrett likes to say. \"You have adversity every play, play to play within a series, certainly from game to game. If you're not mentally strong enough and you don't have the right character and the right makeup to handle adversity, you're not going to be able to handle the situation and you'll have a negative impact on the rest of your team.\n\"It's as simple as that.\"\nAnother simple message comes into play as well.\nNext man up. It applies this week as the team attempts to overcome the loss of Romo and the demotion of Brandon Weeden in favor of Matt Cassel. It applies as Dez Bryant attempts to return for the first time since fracturing his fifth metatarsal in the season opener against the Giants with no assurance that he will.\nIt applied back in November 2010 when rookie free agent Bryan McCann, who found himself in the game after injuries to starting cornerbacks Terrence Newman and Mike Jenkins, returned an interception 101 yards for a touchdown and Jon Kitna got the win at quarterback.\nGarrett did something in his first game as head coach that Tom Landry, Jimmy Johnson and Bill Parcells all failed to do in their coaching debuts with the Cowboys.\nHe won.\nJones didn't want to make too much of that first victory. He called it a baby step to where the team needed to go.\nA win over the Giants on Sunday afternoon would be a baby step -- a potentially significant one -- to getting this team to where it wants to go. The Cowboys enter the game as underdogs, and rightfully so. That doesn't mean they can't win a game they're supposed to lose to the Giants.\nIt's happened before.\nCatch David Moore on The Ticket (KTCK-AM 1310 and 96.7 FM) with The Musers at 9:35 a.m. every Monday and Friday and The Hardline at 4:10 p.m. every Tuesday and Friday during the season.\nTwitter: @ DavidMooreDMN\nLatest Cowboys analysis\nMoore: This situation, Giants game should look familiar to Cowboys coach Jason Garrett\nDo Cowboys' offensive problems go beyond injuries to Tony Romo, Dez Bryant?\nBest of Jon Machota: Updated week-by-week Cowboys predictions; Why fans should still have hope\nCowboys rival analysis: Who's Dallas' biggest threat in NFC East?\nLatest news, photos Randy Gregory expects to play this week, but how much will see from him against the Giants?\nCowboys' next opponent: Giants fall to Eagles in sloppy, terrible, no good, very bad game\nTravis Frederick: Cowboys defense was showing us stuff in practice we haven't seen anywhere else in NFL\nTop 15 fan photos from the Cowboys' first five games, including the Pope, an octo-bong, Left Shark and more\nTop 15 photos from the Cowboys' first five games; Terrance Williams levitates, Erin Andrews can't even\nCowboys WR Dez Bryant returns to alma mater Friday for Lufkin's homecoming\nGreg Hardy: Should you root for him?
