It's time for a new approach to gun violence.\n We're angry, but we also need to be smart. And frankly, liberal efforts, such as the assault weapons ban, were poorly designed and saved few lives, while brazen talk about banning guns just sparked a backlash that empowered the National Rifle Association.\nWhat we need is an evidence-based public health approach -- the same model we use to reduce deaths from other potentially dangerous things around us, from swimming pools to cigarettes. We're not going to eliminate guns in America, so we need to figure out how to coexist with them.\nFirst, we need to comprehend the scale of the problem: It's not just occasional mass shootings like the one at an Oregon college on Thursday, but a continuous deluge of gun deaths, an average of 92 every day in America. Since 1970, more Americans have died from guns than died in all U.S. wars going back to the American Revolution.\nWhen I reported a similar figure in the past, gun lobbyists insisted that it couldn't possibly be true. But the numbers are unarguable: fewer than 1.4 million war deaths since 1775, more than half in the Civil War, versus about 1.45 million gun deaths since 1970 (including suicides, murders and accidents).\nIf that doesn't make you flinch, consider this: In America, more preschoolers are shot dead each year (82 in 2013) than police officers are in the line of duty (27 in 2013), according to figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FBI.\nMore than 60 percent of gun deaths are suicides, and most of the rest are homicides. Gun enthusiasts scoff at including suicides, saying that without guns people would kill themselves by other means. In many cases, though, that's not true.\nIn Great Britain, people used to kill themselves by putting their heads in the oven and asphyxiating themselves with coal gas. This accounted for almost half of British suicides in the late 1950s, but Britain then began switching from coal gas to natural gas, which is much less lethal. Sticking one's head in the oven was no longer a reliable way to kill oneself -- and there was surprisingly little substitution of other methods. Suicide rates dropped, and they stayed at a lower level.\nThe British didn't ban ovens, but they made them safer. We need to do the same with guns.\nWhen I tweeted about the need to address gun violence after the college shooting in the Roseburg, Oregon, a man named Bob pushed back. \"Check out car accident deaths,\" he tweeted sarcastically. \"Guess we should ban cars.\"\nActually, cars exemplify the public health approach we need to apply to guns. We don't ban cars, but we do require driver's licenses, seat belts, air bags, padded dashboards, safety glass and collapsible steering columns. And we've reduced the auto fatality rate by 95 percent.\nOne problem is that the gun lobby has largely blocked research on making guns safer. Between 1973 and 2012, the National Institutes of Health awarded 89 grants for the study of rabies and 212 for cholera -- and only three for firearms injuries.\nDaniel Webster, a public health expert at Johns Hopkins University, notes that in 1999, the government listed the gun stores that had sold the most weapons later linked to crimes. The gun store at the top of the list was so embarrassed that it voluntarily took measures to reduce its use by criminals -- and the rate at which new guns from the store were diverted to crime dropped 77 percent.\nBut in 2003, Congress barred the government from publishing such information.\nWhy is Congress enabling pipelines of guns to criminals?\nPublic health experts cite many ways we could live more safely with guns, and many of them have broad popular support.\nA poll this year found that majorities even of gun owners favor universal background checks; tighter regulation of gun dealers; safe storage requirements in homes; and a 10-year prohibition on possessing guns for anyone convicted of domestic violence, assault or similar offenses.\nWe should also be investing in \"smart gun\" technology, such as weapons that fire only with a PIN or fingerprint. We should adopt microstamping that allows a bullet casing to be traced back to a particular gun. We can require liability insurance for guns, as we do for cars.\nIt's not clear that these steps would have prevented the Oregon shooting. But Webster argues that smarter gun policies could reduce murder rates by up to 50 percent -- and that's thousands of lives a year. Right now, the passivity of politicians is simply enabling shooters.\nThe gun lobby argues that the problem isn't firearms; it's crazy people. Yes, America's mental health system is a disgrace. But to me, it seems that we're all crazy if we as a country can't take modest steps to reduce the carnage that leaves America resembling a battlefield.\nContact Kristof at Facebook.com/Kristof and Twitter.com/NickKristof.\n(c) 2015, The New York Times News Service", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:40:33.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
