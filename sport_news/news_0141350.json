(AP) — The Larimer County Sheriff's Office has arrested seven people after raiding an illegal marijuana grow operation near Fort Collins.\nThe Coloradoan reports (http://noconow.co/1P0qZqn ) that officials say they seized hundreds of live plants and broke up a recently established and elaborate pot distribution right during the raid late last month.\nInvestigators say the head of the operation posed as a real estate agent to find a headquarters for the marijuana. They say once he found a suitable location, he threatened the land owner with a racial discrimination lawsuit unless he could use the property.\nSheriff's deputies visited the property and found 75 pounds of finished, sale-ready bud marijuana and 245 live marijuana plants.\nThe ringleader, 35-year-old Mario Garcia, was arrested Oct. 5 and faces felony drug and extortion charges.\n———\nInformation from: Fort Collins Coloradoan, http://www.coloradoan.com\nAdvertisement", "external_links": ["http://noconow.co/1P0qZqn"], "published": "2015-10-08T16:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:57:25.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
