Posted: Thursday, October 8, 2015 1:57 pm Dwayne Lawson gives Hokies a path to the future Chase Parker, sports staff writer   0 comments \nLittle has gone right for Virginia Tech football this season. Heading into the week four game against NC State with a 2-3 record, the Hokie faithful are losing hope. \n“I have loved the Hokies since I was a kid, but I’m so frustrated with the team right now. I’m sick of watching them get embarrassed over and over again,\" said Virginia Tech fan Cameron Cash. \"Looking at the schedule ahead, I can’t see us winning more than five total games this year.\" \nIt is clear that Virginia Tech fans are losing patience with the team. In the past three years, Virginia Tech has finished the seasons 7-6, 8-5 and 7-6 respectively. The Hokies need a savior – a new talent who could potentially turn Virginia Tech into a national powerhouse once again. \nInsert Florida native Dwayne Lawson. \nLawson is a four-star quarterback recruit out of Tampa, Florida. On ESPN’s top 300 quarterback prospects for 2015, Lawson was ranked fifth in the nation. \nThis 6-foot-6 dual-threat quarterback was highly sought after by colleges all across the country. On Jan. 4, 2015, Lawson chose to sign with Virginia Tech over schools such as Miami, Ole Miss and Florida State. \nIn his senior season at Hillsborough High School, Lawson threw for 2,444 yards, 21 touchdowns, averaged 222.2 yards per game and threw only three interceptions. \nOn the ground, the dual-threat quarterback rushed for 867 yards, 17 touchdowns and averaged 7.3 yards per carry. In total, Lawson was responsible for 3,364 total yards and 38 touchdowns in his final high school season. \n“He has pro quarterback potential, in my opinion,” said Virginia Tech offensive coordinator Scot Loeffler told The Washington Post. “We wanted to establish as much depth as we can at that position and make it extremely competitive.” \nVirginia Tech has historically been a better team with a dual-threat quarterback at the helm. Michael Vick, Marcus Vick and Tyrod Taylor – to name a few – all led the Hokies to championships and bowl victories by being threats through the air and on the ground. \nLawson has already seen the field for the Hokies. However, his time has been very limited. Against Furman, Lawson came into the game for a little more than 10 plays. He threw the ball seven times, completing three passes for 51 yards. He also rushed nine times for 51 yards and a touchdown. \nDespite a solid but small debut, Lawson saw less playing time in the Hokies' following game against Purdue. He attempted just one pass, which was incomplete, and rushed four times for zero yards. He hasn’t seen the field since. \nAlthough the past few years of Virginia Tech football have been dismal and disappointing, the future looks bright. The skill set that Lawson brings to the Hokies may be just what they need to get things turned around. Dwayne Lawson brings many things to the table, but perhaps the most important thing that he presents is hope.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:08:17.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
