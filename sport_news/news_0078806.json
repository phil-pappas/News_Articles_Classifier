The school announced Wednesday the animal is suffering from \"a life-threatening condition still being explored by his veterinarians.\"\nHandled and cared for by UT's Silver Spurs spirit organization, Bevo XIV has attended home football games and many road games since taking over as mascot in 2004. The Longhorns have a record of 106-41 during his reign.\nIn a statement released by the school, Silver Spurs alumni association president Ricky Brennes called Bevo \"a fighter\" and \"a symbol of strength\" and said the organization will update the public as it learns more about the animal's condition.\nClick through the slides to see BEVO through the years and the outpouring of support he's received on social media.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/25/44/67/5656050/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/31/24/65/6638943/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/17/8754169/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/36/24/63/7949566/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/25/45/64/5659909/6/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/36/24/63/7949566/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/61/8719430/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/20/61/8719430/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/25/45/56/5659521/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/31/24/65/6638943/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/17/8754169/4/920x920.png", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/20/8754208/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/20/8754183/4/920x920.png", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/25/45/64/5659909/6/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/20/8754183/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/17/8754155/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/25/46/01/5660767/6/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/20/8754208/4/920x920.png", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/17/8754112/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/25/44/67/5656050/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/25/46/10/5661235/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/25/46/01/5660767/6/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/17/8754155/4/920x920.png", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/25/45/56/5659521/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/17/8754164/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/17/8754164/4/920x920.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/25/46/10/5661235/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/17/8754112/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:59:00.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
