(AP) - Georgia coach Mark Richt says star running back Nick Chubb is out for the season with a left knee injury. A Heisman Trophy hopeful, Chubb was injured on the first play of the game in Saturday's loss at Tennessee. Georgia's director of sports medicine said in a release Sunday that Chubb suffered damage to several ligaments and cartilage but did not have an ACL tear. Director Ron Courson added the damage is repairable, full recovery is expected and surgery will take place within two weeks. Chubb came into the game with 13 consecutive 100-yard rushing games. After a 2-yard run, he was hit by cornerback Emmanuel Moseley and later by linebacker Jalen Reeves-Maybin. He was taken from the field and returned to watch the second half of the game from the sideline.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:17:47.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
