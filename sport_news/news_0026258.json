Done. New day. We took care of it.\"\nCollins confirmed Harvey was fined and remains scheduled to start Game 3 against the Dodgers in the best-of-five Division Series. Jacob deGrom gets the ball Friday night in Game 1 versus last year's NL MVP, Clayton Kershaw.\nThe manager said Harvey spoke to his teammates and was \"extremely apologetic\" again Wednesday morning. Publicly, the star pitcher offered no explanation for why he showed up so late Tuesday, saying he simply \"screwed up.\"\nCollins initially told reporters Harvey called and said he got stuck in traffic. Later, the manager mentioned that when Harvey finally arrived, he said he had lost track of time.\n\"It's not big to us. It's not major news to us. It's major news to you guys because it's a story and I certainly get that, but we handle that kind of stuff in-house,\" Collins said Wednesday. \"Why he wasn't here? I don't care. The only thing I care about is he wasn't here and so that I have to worry about and that I have to take care of and I have.\"\n\"We had a little bit of a setback, a little bit of a problem, distraction, on an off day. Who really cares?\" the manager added.\nAsked if Harvey was fined a substantial amount, a smiling Collins said: \"He can afford it.\"\nCould there be any additional discipline?\n\"I can't say there wouldn't be something else, but there's no more on my side. Is he going to have to wait on a couple guys on the plane? Maybe. The players deal with that stuff, not me,\" Collins said.\nAnyone late Wednesday?\n\"Bartolo (Colon) got stuck in traffic but made it. He's got a 4-wheel drive,\" Collins answered with a grin.\nAll jokes aside, Harvey's conspicuous absence was just the latest dramatic episode during his 3 1/2 seasons in New York — even though he sat out one of them while rehabbing from Tommy John surgery.\nThe right-hander has cultivated an alpha-male image (with a willing boost from the Mets' staff) and gets his initial opportunity on the October stage Monday in the first playoff game at 7-season-old Citi Field.\n\"There's so much panic around here. So tense,\" Collins said. \"When the games start there will be pressure, but this is going to be fun. You look back at what you had to do to get here, this should be an enjoyable time. Yeah, there are expectations. We're aware of that. But we accomplished a lot of things this summer and we should have some fun. And we get on that plane today and we're back in a smaller group and get ready to go, and when Friday comes the intensity and the competitiveness will come out.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:07:36.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
