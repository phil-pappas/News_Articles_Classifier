Since coming over from Monaco, the expensive teenager has been a God-send for the Red Devils, providing the spark plug that the offense badly needed. \nWith a dream start to his Old Trafford career, he’s been worth every penny thus far. Now Anthony Martial is dreaming bigger for United. \nAnthony Martial, who made his first ever start for France tonight (here’s the video highlights), told French TV show Telefoot: \n“I think we can win the Premier League and the Champions League this season.
