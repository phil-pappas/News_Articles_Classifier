The winning streak is the third longest in the country behind No. 1 Ohio State (20 games) and No. 4 TCU (15 games). \nDane Evans was 24-of-36 passing for 421 yards and four touchdowns for the Golden Hurricane (3-4, 0-3). Keyarris Garrett had 14 catches for a career-high 268 yards and three touchdowns. \nBoth in the top 10 nationally in total offense, the teams combined for 1,248 yards of offense in the wild back-and-forth affair. Utah-USC: Utah is the unbeaten No. 3 team in the nation, riding an eight-game winning streak and a world of confidence. The Utes are on the road this week against a .500 opponent with an interim head coach and three losses in its last four games. And Utah is still an underdog to USC in the oddsmakers' eyes. \nEven during a season of utter upheaval for USC, the Trojans' storehouse of top talent still gets everyone's respect, including that of the cautious Utes (6-0, 3-0 Pac-12). Advertisement \n\"I don't think that anyone would argue (against the fact) that year in, year out, they're the most talented team in the Pac-12,\" Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said. \"We've got to be at our absolute best this week to have a chance. ... The Coliseum is a great venue. It's one of the most storied stadiums in the country, but I think it boils down to the talent level they have.\" \nYet the Utes clearly are doing more to turn their comparatively modest talent into winning football, while the Trojans (3-3, 1-2) are desperate for a confidence-boosting win. \nEven if the oddsmakers favor USC, the Trojans hold the Utes in the respect they deserve. \n\"Utah has been a tough team for the last couple of years, taking us to the fourth quarter every year,\" USC linebacker Su'a Cravens said. \"It's not surprising they're ranked where they are, but it's our job to knock them off.\" Ohio State-Rutgers: No. 1 Ohio State turns to J.T. Barrett to lead its offense against Rutgers on Saturday after seven games of ups and downs with Cardale Jones as the starter. The Scarlet Knights have had no such issues with their quarterback. Chris Laviano has seized the job for Rutgers after a preseason competition that did not get nearly the attention as the one making headlines in Columbus, Ohio. \nLaviano is second in the Big Ten in passer rating (156.14), leads in completion percentage (69.3) and is coming off a career game. The sophomore threw for 386 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Scarlet Knights (3-3, 1-2) from 25 points down to beat Indiana 55-52 last week. \nIf only Urban Meyer had it so easy with his quarterbacks. Jones has started since Week 1 against Virginia Tech, but his play has been inconsistent at best, especially in the red zone, so this week Barrett was promoted by Meyer. \nLast year's Big Ten player of the year has accounted for seven touchdowns (five running and two passing) the last two games in relief of Jones. \n\"He's a true field general,\" tight end Nick Vannett said of Barrett. \"He grabs the attention of everybody, and everybody listens to what he says. When you have a quarterback like that, it definitely gives you confidence in the offense.\" Texas A&M-Mississippi: Texas A&M and Mississippi are good teams that didn't play very good football last weekend. Now the 15th-ranked Aggies (5-1, 2-1 Southeastern Conference) must travel to face the 24th-ranked Rebels (5-2, 2-1) on Saturday in a vital Western Division game for both teams. \nBoth teams have plenty of football-related issues to work out. But the most important developments that could decide Saturday's game don't necessarily involve X's and O's. \nOle Miss is coming off a sobering 37-24 loss to Memphis. The Rebels have lost two of four games since an upset win over Alabama in late September. \n\"We are going to see Saturday night if the heart is there,\" Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze said. \"I'm sure we will do what we have done every week and prepare them to have that. It is an individual decision. I am going to do everything within my power that I can to make sure that occurs.\" \nTexas A&M fell flat in a 41-23 loss to Alabama last weekend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:12:29.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
