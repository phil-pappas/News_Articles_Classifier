Runner seasoned beyond her years 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nKathryn Tenney, just a freshman, is in her third year as a member of the Colonie girls' varsity cross country team. \nSaturday, Tenney won the Division II race at the Grout Run in Schenectady's Central Park — registering the fastest time of the day among Section II competitors in 15 minutes, 24.5 seconds. \nQ: How do you feel the season has gone so far? \nA: My team has been doing very well with a 7-0 streak and personally, I have been doing pretty well. \nQ: Did you enter the season with a level of expectation regarding your individual results? \nA: I just wanted to set as many personal records on as many courses as I could. This is a TU+ story. Click for more information. \nQ: Is there a particular course you really enjoy running on more than the others? \nA: One of my favorites is at Queensbury, but we haven't run there since I was in seventh grade. This season, we're running at (Guilderland's) Tawasentha Park. That is my favorite course. \nQ: How would you describe Saturday's performance at the Grout Run? \nA: I don't know if I was expecting to win, but I did want to get a faster time than last year. That was my goal. \nQ: Were you surprised when you finished the race and it took a while for teammate Amanda Chambers to cross the line in second place? \nA: Usually, I will turn around at some point to see if anyone is near me. This time, I didn't. I was pretty surprised. \nQ: You have some big races upcoming before sectionals. Do you think you can make the state meet this year? \nA: I think I have a chance. I would like to make it to the states because I never have before. I know my teammates have before. I think I am good enough to make it there. \nQ: It is a long way off, but would you like to run in college? \nA: Yes, I would take that under consideration if I get that chance. I am also a basketball player, too. \nQ: You have won a lot of races this season. Is that what you expected? \nA: My main thing was to set as many personal bests as I could. \nQ: Does the break in your running schedule with basketball help you? \nA: Basketball is different. I don't know. I am the only one on the cross country team that doesn't run all three seasons, so I do think it helps me. \nQ: Running in Section II is a pretty special experience with so many top teams. Does that bring out the competitiveness in you? \nA: I am a really competitive person. Anyone that I see near me in a race, I work to get myself up there. \nHonor roll \nA look at this past week's top performers: \nJulia Flower, Schalmont girls' cross country: The senior won the Class C
