The hunger is very much there.” \nThe manner of the win was underlined by the passing quality of Bayern's Germany centreback Jerome Boateng, who supplied pin-point accurate long balls for Mueller's first and Lewandowski's goal. \nHead coach Pep Guardiola was delighted as his side picked up their eighth straight league win of the season and their record of 28 goals scored, four against means they have had the best ever start to a Bundesliga season. \n“I have to congratulate the players, not just for today, but for the last few months,” said Guardiola. \n“We're happy because we won against one of the best sides in Europe. \n“We struggled in the first 15 minutes, but our third goal made the difference. \n“We scored the first goal despite having very few chances early on, those long balls from Boateng were exceptional.” \nKeep calm, carry on \nDespite the emphatic manner of the victory, Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge is demanding no over-confidence: “We must not be arrogant. Our slogan is: keep calm and carry on.” \nDortmund coach Thomas Tuchel insisted his side had played into Bayern's hands by failing to defend against Boateng's long balls. \n“We made life far too easy for Bayern. The opening goal was the worst to concede,” he said. \n“A long ball from 40 metres — that shouldn't happen, and it was the same for the third, because you have to close the gap quicker. \n“We also gave away a cheap penalty. \n“We have to work harder in training now and reset — that's sorely needed.” \nAfter Dormtund dominated the opening 20 minutes, Bayern stepped up a gear when Mueller controlled Boateng's long pass to beat Dortmund goalkeeper Roman Burki on 26 minutes. \nDortmund conceded a penalty when Henrikh Mkhitaryan fouled Thiago in the area and Mueller drilled home the spot-kick on 35 minutes to double the hosts' lead. \nThe visitors fought back on 36 minutes when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang swept home Gonzalo Castro's superb cross, but it was all Bayern from then on. \nLewandowski made it 3-1 on 46 minutes when he finished off his half-chance after another superb long ball from Boateng. \nThe floodgates opened when Lewandowski slotted home Goetze's great cross on 58 minutes, then the latter hit the back of the net from 12 yards out on 66 minutes. \nTuchel gave a straight answer when asked if any in Germany's top tier can currently rival the Bavarians: “No, of course not, they are just too good playing like this.” — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:52:41.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
