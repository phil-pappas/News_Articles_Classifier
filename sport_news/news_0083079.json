The city of Ramadi is completely isolated from the northern side now,\" said Major General Ismail Mahalawi, from Anbar Operations Command.\nA coalition spokesman said last week the number of IS fighters still inside Ramadi was estimated at 600 to 1,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:26:12.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
