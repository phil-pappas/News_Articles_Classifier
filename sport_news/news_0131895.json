But others weren't as fortunate.\nDan Krofta, 49, and Joshua Langley, 44, wore torn and bloodied military fatigues as they shuffled and groaned in the zombie parade.\n\"We used to be zombie warriors, and we kind of got taken over,\" Langley said.\nThe two once dressed as the good guys, but now they like being zombies.\n\"It's just a blast scaring the crap out of people,\" Krofta said.\nJared Greenfield, a 22-year-old from Littleton who dressed in military fatigues, disagreed.\n\"It's a self-fulfilling prophecy if you came as a zombie,\" he said. \"Those who want to survive come as survivors to practice.\"", "external_links": ["http://residentevil.wikia.com/wiki/Special_Tactics_and_Rescue_Service", "http://eyeheartbrains.com/"], "published": "2015-10-17T15:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:03:55.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
