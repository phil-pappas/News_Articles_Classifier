It's one of those teams, man, that they look out of sync right now, but they'll find their rhythm at some point during the season.\" \nThe Lions, the NFL's only winless team at 0-4, rank 29th in the league in scoring at just 16.5 points per game and have not scored an offensive touchdown in their last 15 possessions. \nJohnson, for years one of the game's best deep threats, is averaging just 9.4 yards per catch, and the Lions have just two pass plays of longer than 30 yards this year. \n\"That always surprises me,\" Arians said about the Lions' lack of explosive plays. \"I think (Matthew Stafford is) one of the best in the business. I love going out and watching him warm up because he can make every throw in the book.\" \nJohnson said he was encouraged that the Lions took two deep shots in Monday's 13-10 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, even though neither pass connected. \nStafford blamed himself for making \"two poor throws\" on the plays. \n\"We've just got to keep on taking them,\" Johnson said. \"Back that defense up so they're not playing or sitting on routes, whatever it may be. But yeah, definitely you should take those early and often.\" \nMathieu said he's still wary of the deep ball with Johnson, and that he expects the Lions' to their offense back on track soon. \n\"You talk about their personnel and it's not like those guys have a bad quarterback,\" Mathieu said. \"I mean, they have Matthew Stafford back there. They have some pretty good running backs, and they have some pretty good wide receivers. For me, they just look like they don't quite understand the system yet, so to say, because you think about it, those guys, they could easily put up 30 points a game.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:01:44.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
