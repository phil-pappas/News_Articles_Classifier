Names of the victims have not been released.\nPortland Fire & Rescue crews were dispatched at 7:15 a.m. to investigate a report of fire in a one-story apartment complex in the Creston-Kenilworth neighborhood.\nArriving firefighters found smoke and flames pouring from the back of an apartment in the 3900 block of Southeast Gladstone Street .\nThe fire was largely contained to one two-bedroom apartment, though a downed electrical line sparked another blaze behind the apartment.\nThe fire's cause remains under investigation. A damage estimate is not yet available.\n Portland police closed access to Southeast Gladstone Street from Cesar E. Chavez Boulevard on the west side of the scene to 42nd Avenue on the east.\nMore than an hour after the blaze started, Tom Holiday watched fire crews work with a chain saw to remove smoking shingles on the roof of the building.\nHoliday, who lives next door to the burned-out apartment with his wife, Tamara, and cat, Mongo, said he was in bed when he heard what sounded like firecrackers.\n\"There was this weird crackling sound,\" said Holiday, 34. He also smelled smoke.\nHoliday said they have lived in that apartment for about six years, and rarely saw the next-door neighbors, whom he described as elderly. Holiday said they stayed inside much of the time and were assisted by in-home caregivers, Holiday said.\nHoliday called 911 shortly after they were safely outside, but at that point, he already heard sirens.\n-- Andrew Theen atheen@oregonian.com\n503-294-4026 @cityhallwatch\n-- Rick Bella rbella@oregonian.com\n503-294-5915; @southnewshound", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/cityhallwatch", "http://oregonlive.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Return%20to%20the%20photo%20gallery&backurl=http%3A%2F%2Fphotos.oregonlive.com%2Foregonian%2F2015%2F10%2Fse_gladstone_street_fire_1.html&image=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.oregonlive.com%2Foregonian%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F10%2F09%2F18933312-standard.jpg&pricingsheetid=&caption=%3Cp%3EPortland%20firefighters%20battle%20an%20apartment%20fire%20in%20the%203900%20block%20of%20Southeast%20Gladstone%20Street%20on%20Friday%20morning.%3C%2Fp%3E&affphotographername=Andrew%20Theen%20%7C", "https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2796.8316199246497!2d-122.62479358444155!3d45.49333537910125!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x5495a07a097c5cc1%3A0x96a7451f74033757!2s3900+SE+Gladstone+St%2C+Portland%2C+OR+97202!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1444401720660", "http://oregonlive.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Return%20to%20the%20photo%20gallery&backurl=http%3A%2F%2Fphotos.oregonlive.com%2Foregonian%2F2015%2F10%2Fse_gladstone_street_fire.html&image=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.oregonlive.com%2Foregonian%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F10%2F09%2F18933311-standard.jpg&pricingsheetid=&caption=%3Cp%3EPortland%20firefighters%20battle%20an%20apartment%20fire%20in%20the%203900%20block%20of%20Southeast%20Gladstone%20Street%20on%20Friday%20morning.%3C%2Fp%3E&affphotographername=Andrew%20Theen%20%7C%2", "https://www.google.com/maps/place/3900+SE+Gladstone+St,+Portland,+OR+97202/@45.4933354,-122.6247936,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x5495a07a097c5cc1:0x96a7451f74033757", "http://www.portlandoregon.gov/fire/", "https://twitter.com/southnewshound", "http://oregonlive.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Return%20to%20the%20photo%20gallery&backurl=http%3A%2F%2Fphotos.oregonlive.com%2Foregonian%2F2015%2F10%2Fse_gladstone_street_fire_2.html&image=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.oregonlive.com%2Foregonian%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F10%2F09%2F18933314-standard.jpg&pricingsheetid=&caption=%3Cp%3ETom%20Holiday%2C%2034%2C%20watches%20crews%20work%20on%20his%20neighbors%27%20apartment.%20Holiday%20and%20his%20wife%20were%20not%20injured%2C%20but%20their%20apartment%20may%20have%20been%20dama"], "published": "2015-10-09T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:20:03.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
