The Wolves (0-7-0, 0-7-0 CCC) managed only one shot on goal in the contest, and were shut out for the fourth time this season. Warner Pacific (6-5-1, 4-2-1 CCC) scored its first goal at the 30:20 mark as senior forward Cesar Esquivel found the back of the net to put the Knights ahead. The winning goal was Esquivel’s seventh on the season. The Knights followed with two more successful shots in the second half, as Edgar Contreras (59:25) and Jack Andrade (72:30) put the contest out of reach. The Wolves, despite their 3-0 setback, had some highlights of their own. Junior goaltender Josh Fry continued his solid play between the pipes. Fry was peppered with 17 shots on goal, and made several impressive saves throughout the match. Freshmen midfielder Alberto Garibay started in his first appearance of the season for the Wolves. Garibay, along with first-year senior midfielder Randy Folkenberg, both saw their first action of the 2015 campaign, after gaining NAIA eligibility this week. The Wolves return to action at home at 6 p.m. today as they host the Mountaineers of Eastern Oregon University.
