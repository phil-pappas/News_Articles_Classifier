(AP Photo/Bob Leverone) \nFOXBOROUGH â€” Patriots head coach Bill Belichick called defensive lineman Akiem Hicks, who New England acquired from the Saints on Sept. 30 for tight end Michael Hoomanawanui, \"a sharp guy.\" \n\"And Rob (Ryan)'s defense, I'd say there is probably some carryover from what he did in New Orleans to what we do here,\" Belichick said. \"I'm not saying it's the same, but there is some part of the family of each of those that's connected. But yeah, it's just kind of learning our words and our terms and relating them to things he's done in the past. I don't think we're going to be asking him to do things he's never done before. I think he's working hard to pick it up. We'll see how quickly it all comes together. I'd say he's making good progress. Having a few extra days, that's helped, too.\" \nHicks, a 324-pound 25-year-old, has put a lot of work into learning the schemes. \n\"Coming into this new scheme, I think one my traits that I carry with me wherever I go is discipline,\" Hicks said. \"My dad was in the military for 22 years so it's just something I believe in. So I've definitely been dedicated and working hard toward scheme and being able to be a help to this defense.\" \nHicks' dad served in the Army. The family was stationed in California throughout Hick's childhood. \nHicks actually thought some about joining the military while growing up. \n\"Definitely,\" he said. \"It was a huge thought on my mind until I became good at football.\" \nHicks said he arrived in Foxborough during the bye week. \n\"I really didn't get to experience the bye week as everyone else did,\" he said. \"So I'm hitting the ground running.\" \nThe 2012 third-round pick played 66.8 percent of defensive snaps in 2014, but just 50.5 percent through three games this season. \n\"This is my first time playing for a new team since I've been in the NFL so it's definitely a transition period and I'm learning as fast as I can,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:07:28.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
