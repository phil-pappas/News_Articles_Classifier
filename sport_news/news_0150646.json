Hillig kicked off breast cancer awareness month Thursday afternoon by being the first to donate her hair. ANNE MILLERBERND, CONTRIBUTING PHOTOGRAPHER Related article » How to donate Hair requirements: Hair donations must be a minimum of 8 inches long. Hair cannot be permanently colored or more than about 5 percent gray.\nMake an appointment: Walk-ins are accepted, but staff recommend calling 951-770-8501 to make an appointment. Drop-off donations are welcome.\nWhere: Spa Pechanga is in the Pechanga Resort & Casino at 45000 Pechanga Parkway, Temecula\nWhen: Donations will be accepted through Oct. 31.\nRachel Hillig couldn’t help but smile as her hairdresser pulled her waist-length locks into two ponytails and began to slowly cut away. The hiss of shears slicing off exactly half her hair didn’t faze the Perris woman one bit.\n“It grows back,” Hillig said, flipping her head back and forth. “I feel much lighter. I could do this all day.”\nHillig’s newly acquired hairstyle kicked off a month of hair donations Thursday at Spa Pechanga inside Pechanga Resort & Casino to mark Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\nCasino officials approached Hillig, who works as a casino cold prep cook, last month about cutting her two-foot-long hair for a good cause. She says she’s always up for a new ’do, but the idea also resonated for Hillig. Her mother, Rita Fisher, beat ovarian cancer in 2005, and at least four of her friends have struggled with breast cancer.\n“Just knowing what (my mom) went through losing her hair kind of prompted it, but my best friend was diagnosed with breast cancer after she lost her mom to it,” Hillig said. “Three of my bunco friends are also currently going through it … they’re the reason I don’t have a problem doing it.”\nThis is the spa’s third year offering free haircuts with an 8-inch or longer donation. Spa Manager Gina Layland said Hillig’s donation will be the 51st since the service began, and eight appointments had been booked by the first of the month. The hair is used to make wigs for women with breast cancer.\nIt took spa hairstylist Lauren Fink about 45 minutes to undo three years of hair growth, and Hillig didn’t even flinch at the two 12-inch ponytails on a cart behind her chair. In fact, the 46-year-old never stopped smiling.\nHillig said her husband loved her long hair and it was easier to pull back for her job, so she decided to let it grow out.\nFisher, who came to watch her daughter’s transformation, was a hairstylist while her three kids were growing up. Hillig, she said, was always open to trying something new.\n“Two of (my kids) would cry if I tried anything too crazy – not (Rachel),” Fisher said.\nThree of the 12 women in Hillig’s bunco group have been diagnosed with breast cancer. On average, 1 in 8 women will face a breast cancer diagnosis in her life, according to the American Cancer Society.\nOne of Hillig’s bunco friends, Trudy Duggan, underwent a double mastectomy in April 2013 to rid herself of the disease.\nShe thought losing her breasts would be the end of her treatment, but an oncologist told her she would need chemotherapy to reduce her chances of getting any other cancer. She was told she would lose her hair three weeks into the radiation treatment.\n“And let me tell you, on day 21 I got out of bed and looked in the mirror and I could just see the clumps coming out,” Duggan said.\nShe fought back tears and told her daughter to hurry up as she shaved away the remaining hair.\nDuggan, who works at Kay Jewelers, worried about her customers. The 59-year-old didn’t want them to feel sorry for her, or look at her differently, so she wore two wigs made of real hair.\n“I didn’t want anybody to treat me differently and the wig just makes me feel normal,” Duggan said. “Having hair means a lot – more than you think.”\nContact the writer: community@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvpxri-b88530610z.120151004160913000gfecc9e0.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvpxri-b88530610z.120151004160913000gfecc9e2.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvpxri-b88530610z.120151004160913000gfecc9e0.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvpxri-b88530610z.120151004160913000gfecc9e2.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvpxrj-b88530610z.120151004160913000gfecc9e4.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvpxrh-b88530610z.120151004160913000gfecc9du.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvpxrh-b88530610z.120151004160913000gfecc9du.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvpxrj-b88530610z.120151004160913000gfecc9e4.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:12:50.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
