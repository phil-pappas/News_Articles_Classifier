LOUIS (AP) - Rookie Robby Fabbri scored the tiebreaking goal midway through the third period to help the St. Louis Blues beat Edmonton 3-1 Thursday night, spoiling Oilers rookie Connor McDavid's NHL debut.\nVladimir Tarasenko had the tying goal for the Blues near the midpoint of the second period, and Troy Brouwer added an empty-netter with 18 seconds remaining in the third. Brian Elliott finished with 23 saves.\nRyan Nugent-Hopkins scored in the first period for Edmonton and Cam Talbot had 28 saves.\nMcDavid, the No. 1 overall pick in this year's draft, took 22 shifts, played 18:07 and was on the ice for Brouwer's goal. He had two shots on goal, and struggled on faceoffs - winning only three of 13.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
