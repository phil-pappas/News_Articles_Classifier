So did Memphis.\nSo far, it's all quiet on the unbeaten front, but there's still a full menu of football morning, noon and night on Saturday.\nOn a day without huge portions of Top 25 matchups or unbeaten vs. unbeaten, we still know the expected can turn into the unexpected with one slip up, from a botched snap (Michigan State over Michigan) to a Hail Mary (BYU over Nebraska).\nLet's take a look at some unbeatens worth watching:\n———\nBEWARE THE HURRICANES\nSince Miami (4-2, 1-1) joined the ACC, the 'Canes and Clemson (6-0, 3-0) have met four times — and the home team is 0-4. So why consider the unranked Hurricanes over the sixth-ranked Tigers in their first meeting in five years? Well, three of those four games went to overtime, and perhaps it's time the home team-losing hex ends. Clemson is looking to keep its national title hopes alive; Miami still has hopes of winning the Coastal Division. Will Miami QB Brad Kaaya have time to throw against a pass rush spearheaded by DEs Shaq Lawson and Kevin Dodd? Then again, the last time an unranked Miami team defeated a Top 10 opponent was Dec. 3, 1998 — 39-35 over No. 3 UCLA. (ABC, noon)\n———\nAdvertisement HILLTOPPERS HIGH ON DEATH VALLEY\nThey are averaging 54.5 points in their last four games, and their only loss was by three points on the road to a Big Ten team. Yes, we're talking Western Kentucky (6-1). The Hilltoppers are led by sixth-year senior QB Brady Doughty, who topped the nation in passing last year, is averaging nearly 380 yards per game and already has thrown for 24 TDs this season. No. 5 LSU (6-0) simply has Heisman hopeful Leonard Fournette, who is at 200.3 yards rushing per game. This is a rare non-conference matchup so deep into the season, and the Tigers need to take this group seriously. Coach Les Miles is. \"I just want you to know that this team coming in fits every bit as well in Tiger Stadium as other teams that we've hosted this year,\" Miles said. \"This will be a very good opponent. We'll have to play well to do the things that we want to do. And nationally ranked this team will be.\" (ESPNU, 7 p.m.)\n———\nNO. 3 UTAH IS AN UNDERDOG\nThis won't count as an upset, but c'mon. The undefeated Utes (6-0, 3-0 Pac-12) are 3 1/2 -point underdogs to a team with an interim coach and losses in three of its last four games. Then again, the team is Southern California (3-3, 1-2) and the game is at the Coliseum. Of course, Utah coach Kyle Whittingham, whose name is being mentioned as someone to replace the fired Steve Sarkisian and USC interim Clay Helton, will only be concerned with the final score. \"The Coliseum is a great venue. It's one of the most storied stadiums in the country, but I think it boils down to the talent level they have,\" he said. It should be noted that Utah hasn't won at the Coliseum since 1916, losing twice since joining the Pac-12 a half-decade ago. Utah RB Devontae Booker is a key to Utah's success. \"The leg drive on contact is incredible. He is just a very, very hard man to bring down,\" Helton said. (FOX, 7:30 p.m.)\n———\nSEMINOLE STING\nThe pass and run duo of Everett Golson and Dalvin Cook give No. 9 Florida State (6-0, 4-0 ACC) a huge edge over under-performing Georgia Tech (2-5, 0-4). Failure to shut down the running game (178.4 yards per game) and a freshman running back that made his first start last week — he did run for 159 yards and 2 TDs — doesn't inspire much hope, but under coach Paul Johnson, Georgia Tech is 5-3 against ranked teams at Bobby Dodd Stadium. It should also be noted that Tech is finishing a stretch of six games against teams with a combined record of 33-4.
