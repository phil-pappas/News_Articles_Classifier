It's so unfair. No other referee has had this stuff put out there like that and he's a very good referee,\" Cheika said. \n\"I would have liked my mates to back me up a little more on the odd occasion, if you know what I mean. I feel for him. We talk about having the right principles in the game and all of that... \n\"Genuinely I have never seen that before. I am not sure why that decision had to be publicly reviewed and put out there. \n\"I really hope his fellow referees stand by him because - well, the fact I'm not allowed to say much about it says it all.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:14:07.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
