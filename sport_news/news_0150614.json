Photo courtesy of TMC Athletics A A A \nIt was a banner week for The Master’s College Athletic Department as TMC’s cross country teams posted impressive marks against some of the nation’s best runners at the Pomona-Pitzer Cross Country Invitational, while the men’s and women’s soccer teams defeated both Arizona Christian and William Jessup at Reese Field. \nWomen’s Cross Country \nLast Saturday morning, The Master’s College women’s cross country team placed fourth out of 15 teams after producing a cumulative time of one hour, 53 minutes, 19.66 seconds at the Pomona-Pitzer Cross Country Invitational women’s 6K race. Notably, the Mustangs’ cumulative time set a new team record on the Claremont-based course. \nKaris Frankian, who recently earned the Golden State Athletic Conference’s inaugural Women’s Runner of the Month award, led the seventh-ranked Mustangs by finishing first overall after clocking a time of 21:20.66. \nYounger sister Abigail Frankian was the next Mustang to cross the finish line, placing 11th overall with a final time of 22:25.67. \nLooking forward, the Mustangs will race again on Oct. 17 at the Bronco Invitational in Santa Clara. \nMen’s Cross Country \nWith nice conditions at the Pomona-Pitzer Invitational last Saturday morning, The Master’s College men’s cross country team had a breakthrough performance against a deep field, including the 7th-ranked NCAA Division II Cal Poly Pomona Broncos, by placing fifth out of 16 teams with a cumulative time of 2:11:59.55 in the men’s 8K race. \nBattling for positions on a narrow course, the 18th-ranked ranked Mustangs went out hard towards the front. Josh Sherfey ran neck-and-neck with Cal Poly Pomona’s top runners, cracking into the top ten by capturing an eighth-place finish with a strong time of 25:33.43. \nIn just two weeks’ time, the Mustangs will travel up north to the Bronco Invite held at Sunnyvale Park in Santa Clara on Oct. 17 at 9:00 a.m. \nMen’s Soccer \nAfter beating Arizona Christian 6-0 on Thursday, the 18th-ranked Mustangs kept the William Jessup Warriors silent with a 4-0 victory on Saturday at Reese Field. \nThis marks the second straight shutout for the Mustangs and for goalie Casey Phillips, and makes it the club’s fourth in the past six matches, as TMC improved to 8-2-1 overall and 2-1 in the GSAC. \nNotably, based on last week’s performances against the Firestorm and the Warriors, Phillips earned the GSAC’s Men’s Soccer Defensive Player of the Week. \nAs winners of six of their past seven and boasting the GSAC’s highest-scoring offense (105 points), the Mustangs will take their show on the road next Wednesday when they travel to Santa Barbara to take on always tough Westmont before returning home next Saturday to host No. 3 Vanguard. \nWomen’s Soccer \nThe 23rd-ranked Mustangs remain undefeated at home after beating Arizona Christian 1-0 and William Jessup 2-1 last week on Reese Field. \nTMC (5-5-1, 2-1 GSAC) is now tasked with the challenge of taking down the ninth-ranked Westmont Warriors (7-2-1, 3-0-1 GSAC) today in Santa Barbara. Kickoff is set for 3:00 p.m. \nVolleyball \nTMC’s Morgan Koch posted 15 kills, while Aubrey Pyburn posted 12 more in last Tuesday’s 3-0 loss to GSAC rival Westmont College.
