My serve was good today and it needed to be because Feliciano pressured me today.\"\nFerrer netted victories in Qatar, Rio and Mexico prior to Sunday's Malaysian triumph, winning all four finals contested this year.\n\"It's been a good year for me, winning all the finals. But I remember two years ago I lost in five finals and the statistics have changed,\" said Ferrer who pockets $170,600 in prize money.\n\"I have to enjoy this moment. When I end my career I won't have any of this anymore.\"\nThe match was Ferrer's 50th tour-level final. Others who have attained the feat are Rafael Nadal, Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer.\nFerrer's journey to win the Malaysian title included a two hour and five minute battle to overcome unseeded semi finalist Benjamin Becker from Germany on Saturday.\nSecond seed Lopez said a change of balls in the first set had affected his rhythm on Sunday.\n\"I made some fantastic points in the first game, but a change of balls changed the momentum,\" he said.\n\"I was playing aggressive, but after that he was more consistent and it was difficult for me to win the points.\"\nIn the men's doubles final, Treat Huey from the Philippines and Henri Kontinen from Finland won their second consecutive tournament as a pair after a 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 victory over South African Raven Klaasen and Rajeev Ram from the US.
