He took his team out to preview and lightly jog the layout Monday. \nThe Indians got to see a 107-meter long hill that is fondly called Big Bertha. Runners twice must ascend it and if after racing 3 miles isn’t enough, they have one last challenge – a 50-meter uphill finish. \n“This is a terribly hard course,” Janke said. “I was hurting pretty good. It’s a killer course.” \nJanke said a fast pace was set early in the opening mile. \n“After the first hill, the top LC and U-Hi guys were really pushing it (the pace),” Janke said. \nSo Janke knew he had to pick up his stride. \n“It was a fast first mile on this course. It was just below 5 (minutes),” Janke said. “The fact we went out fast made it even harder.” \nKnight said running at Liberty Lake wouldn’t have been his choice for the final league dual – not with regionals a week from Saturday. \n“This is a true cross country course,” Knight said. “It’s rough. It’s not a run in the park. It beats you up. Your big worry here is somebody might get hurt and there wouldn’t be enough recovery time (for regionals).” \nThere was a 20-second gap between NC’s second finisher, Sam Sjoberg, and the fifth finisher, Mica Jones. \n“We’re making progress,” Knight said. “It’s showing up more in practice than in meets.” \nEarlier this month, NC took second by four points behind Eisenhower, the No. 1-ranked team in 4A, at the Richland Invite. The runner-up finish didn’t so much bother Knight as the fact that the typically tight pack behind Janke was too loose. \n“Richland wasn’t a highlight for the team,” Janke said. “Sam (Sjoberg) ran really well today and he’s been running well lately. Jacob (Christner) is coming back to his normal self and looking as strong as ever. And Gabe (Meek) is always reliable who is really running strong. We’ve been having some indicators of what we’re capable of.” \nIn the girls meet, Abby Smith led LC to a sweep. She won in 18:59, 8 seconds ahead of Claire Dingus of U-Hi. LC’s other top runner, Katie Thronson, missed the meet after coming down with a fever during the day. \nThe Mt. Spokane girls capped an undefeated season by sweeping Mead, Ferris and Shadle Park at Mead. Micaela Kostecka led Mt. Spokane, finishing first (18:52). The Wildcats had a 1-2-3 finish. Following Kostecka were Shawnee Konrad (19:07) and Makenna Endebrock (19:13). … In the boys at Mead, Ferris swept to finish 8-1in league. Erik Holm (15:46) took third, leading the Saxons. Hayden Dressel of Mt. Spokane (15:38) took first. Cameron Dean (1544) led Mead. … At Central Valley, the Bears boys and girls topped Gonzaga Prep. Johnny Cooney (16:03) of G-Prep took first followed by Gabe Romney (16:09) of CV. Kearan Nelson (19:08) of CV won.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:27:31.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
