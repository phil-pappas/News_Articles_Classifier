With so many activities going on in and around the Village, participation was down from prior years. VAC offered three paintings that were given away in drawings during the day. “Bicycle Lady” (below) was painted and donated by former VAC member Liz Armstrong. Denise Metlock was the lucky winner. Jane Moore won the turtle watercolor painting designed, painted and donated by Carol Spohn, a national watercolorist instructor who recently taught a seminar to VAC members. The “tangled” pumpkin has been a popular giveaway the last two years, so club members again offered this creatively painted pumpkin in a drawing. Ruth Hamm was the lucky winner. The pumpkin was painted by four club members — Audrey Sitkowski, Ellen Elder, Jan Amsberry and Darlene Gavos. All three winners were Villagers. \nBe sure to stop by the Coronado Center to see the display of talents by VAC members. They have a widerange of paintings,representing various mediums and skill levels, displayed on the walls of the Coronado Center during the months of October and November. Remember to visit their booth at the Coronado Fall Arts & Crafts Show on Nov. 21, as well as the Mountainside Church Community Craft fair on Dec. 12. \nIf you would like information about joining Village Art Club, contact president Jan Amsberry at 922-5145.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:42:42.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
