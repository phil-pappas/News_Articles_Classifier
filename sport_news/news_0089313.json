Reynolds completed 7 of 11 passes for 133 yards. Wide receiver Jamir Tillman had three catches for 61 yards while slotback Calvin Cass Jr. caught a touchdown toss from backup quarterback Tago Smith. \n“We knew they were going to be tough interior-wise on defense. We saw that coming,” Niumatalolo said. “They played really well defensively and had a good plan, plus they were some big suckers up front. We knew it was going to be tough sledding.” \nNavy was held to 134 rushing yards, easily its lowest output of the season. The Midshipmen came in ranked third nationally with 335.4 rushing yards per game. Reynolds led the meager rushing attack with a mere 38 yards, but increased his career rushing touchdown total to 75, two shy of tying all-time leader Montee Ball (Wisconsin, 2009-2012). \nIt marked the first time that Navy won a game with more passing yards than rushing yards since 2010 against archrival Army. \n“They did a good job of pressing the line on us. Their secondary did a great job of run support, especially No. 2 (safety Darion Monroe) and No. 6 (cornerback Jarrod Franklin). Those guys did a great job of pressing the line whenever they saw it was a running play,” Reynolds said. “We just didn’t execute as well as we should have in the run game.” \nQuarterback Tanner Lee completed 22 of 31 passes for 205 yards to lead Tulane (2-5, 1-3), which was playing in Annapolis for the first time in 10 years. The Green Wave were on the cusp of cutting their deficit to three points early in the fourth period when Lee fumbled at the Navy 1-yard line after being stripped by inside linebacker Daniel Gonzales. \nNavy played perhaps its worst half of football in taking a narrow 10-7 lead into intermission. The Midshipmen needed 13 plays and nearly seven minutes to move 42 yards for a touchdown on their first possession then did virtually nothing offensively the rest of the way. \nTulane went three-and-out on the game’s opening possession and a poor punt gave Navy great field position at the visiting 42-yard line. A chop block penalty on guard Ben Tamburello threatened to derail a methodical march, but a 10-yard completion from Reynolds to Tillman helped keep things alive. The Mids converted a pair of fourth down attempts on the drive, which ended with Reynolds taking a keeper 5 yards to the end zone. \nThe Midshipmen managed just one first down before having to punt from deep in their own territory on their second possession. The Green Wave took over at the home team’s 40-yard line and capitalized on the short field with tailback Dontrell Hilliard bursting off-tackle for a 19-yard touchdown that tied the score. \nUnable to get anything going on the ground, Navy was forced to throw and Reynolds completed two long passes on the ensuing possession. A 23-yard strike to wide receiver Thomas Wilson got the Mids out of the shadow of their own goal-line and a 41-yard bomb that was dropped perfectly into the arms of Tillman set up first-and-goal at the 3. \nLinebacker Nico Marley made a huge play on third down, firing into the backfield as though blasted out of a cannon to throw fullback Shawn White for a 5-yard loss. Navy had to settle for a 25-yard field goal by Austin Grebe and a 10-7 lead at the 5:14 mark of the second period.Tulane had a chance to tie things up at halftime, but a 49-yard field goal attempt by Trevor Simms was way short. \nNavy was limited to 44 rushing yards in the first half, its lowest output in two seasons. It was the first time since a loss to Western Kentucky in 2013 the Mids failed to run for at least 100 yards in the first half. \n“I think we just came out flat. We started off with a good drive, but for the rest of the first half we met some adversity,” Reynolds said. “The good thing is that we didn’t turn the football over and just kept playing. That’s what you have to do in these types of games.” \nNavy’s offensive struggles continued on the opening possession of the second half as consecutive plays resulted in a loss of 10 yards and a punt. Once again, the Mids took to the air to move the ball with Reynolds finding slotback DeBrandon Sanders streaking down the middle for a 36-yard gain deep into enemy territory. Fullback Quentin Ezell scored on the next play, blasting through a nice hole on the left side and barreling 9 yards into the end zone to make it 17-7 with 5:23 left in the third quarter. \nTulane seemed poised to pull back within a field goal when it drove to the Navy 1-yard line on the ensuing possession. Lee appeared to pick up a first down on a quarterback sneak, but had the ball jarred loose by Gonzales with Anthony recovering the fumble. \nThat turnover was the obvious turning point in the close contest with Navy coming off its own goal-line and holding the ball for nearly five minutes before having to punt. Tulane regained possession on its own 15-yard line with just over six minutes to go, but Lee tossed an interception on second down with Barbour making the pick at the 36-yard line. \n“The defense definitely shifted the momentum and gave us good field position when we needed it,” Navy offensive guard E.K. Binns said. \nNavy then put the game away on a 1-yard plunge by Reynolds that increased the lead to 24-7 with 3:38 remaining. \n“I’m just proud of the way our guys fought. Not everything is going to be pretty or like you draw it up, but our guys battled today,” Niumatalolo said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:32:25.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
