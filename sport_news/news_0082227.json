The Rangers’ second baseman used his speed to leg out an infield single and scored two singles later. But the game-winning hit — by Hanser Alberto, who was in the Rangers’ lineup in place of ailing veteran Adrian Beltre — came after a controversial instant-replay decision, in which the Jays believed Odor had been tagged at second base after his foot momentarily left the bag.\nBut replay officials in New York City found the play to be “inconclusive,” so the safe call on the field was upheld.\nOdor scored on the following pitch, evading a tag from Jays’ catcher Russell Martin.\nFriday wasn’t a must-win for the Jays, but it was pretty close. Only five times in baseball history has a team lost the first two games of a five-game series and come back to win it.\nJays’ manager John Gibbons conceded as much before the game.\n“It’s a big game for us,” he said. “We’re at home, you get the first two games at home where we’ve thrived all year, so we need to win this one. It’s definitely not an elimination game but it would go a long way to helping us out, that’s for sure.”\nSo now the Jays head to Arlington with their backs against the wall and their season on the line.\nThere was more bad news for the Jays on the injury front as well, as Brett Cecil, the team’s best reliever, limped off the field in the eighth inning after he appeared to injure one of his legs when he tagged the Rangers’ Mike Napoli in a rundown. Sideline TV reporters wrote on Twitter that the dominant left-hander could be seen on crutches near the team’s clubhouse. Before the end of the game the Jays announced that Cecil had “tightness” in his left calf.\nThe game itself was a vertigo-inducing endurance test.\nA wild, sloppy start for both sides gave way to a mid-game pitching duel between Marcus Stroman and Cole Hamels, and then bullpen stalemate for nearly another game’s worth of innings.\nWhen the benches cleared in the bottom of the 13th inning — after Josh Donaldson watched his would-be walk-off homer hook foul, to the chagrin of Rangers’ reliever Keone Kela, who presumably felt affronted — fans and players alike probably could have used an intermission.\nBut the game, loose at the start and wound extra tight by the end, continued on its tense tightrope — until the Rangers broke through in the 14th.\nIt was another electric atmosphere at the Rogers Centre, where the sold-out crowd of 49,716 rose and fell with every pitch, roaring and hushing at any play that went for or against the Jays, saving their biggest groans for home-plate umpire Vic Carapazza, whose erratic strike zone didn’t earn many friends in either dugout.\nThings got off to a terrible start for Stroman and the Jays, who stumbled badly off the top.\nDelino DeShields led off with a long fly ball to right field that popped in and out of Jose Bautista’s glove, Shin-Soo Choo singled to centre, Prince Fielder bounced a ball up the middle that eluded the usually sure-handed Ryan Goins on a funny hop and then Russell Martin, the Jays’ Gold Glove catcher, threw the ball away on a rundown that would have prevented the Rangers’ second run.\nA single and three misplays and the Jays were down 2-0 before they had recorded an out. But then Chris Colabello took over, making all three first-inning outs himself, including a rare unassisted double play in which he first tagged Josh Hamilton running up the first-base line, before running clear across the diamond to nab a moose-in-headlights Prince Fielder, stranded awkwardly between third and home.\nThe Jays were the most efficient team in baseball at converting balls in play into outs this season, so their collective sloppiness in the early going Friday was an unfamiliar sight.\nBut Colabello’s heads-up play seemed to spark something in the Jays, who struck back quickly in the bottom half of the opening frame.\nIn his return to the lineup after missing the latter half of Thursday’s series opener as a precaution against a possible concussion, Josh Donaldson homered to straightaway centre field in his first at bat.\nBut the Rangers tacked on another run in the second as Stroman led off the inning by walking Rougned Odor — a menace to the Jays through the first two games — on four pitches. Odor then scampered from first to an unoccupied third base on a high chopper that drew Donaldson away from his bag. That allowed Odor to score on a sacrifice fly.\nIn the second it was the Rangers’ turn to fumble the ball. Hanser Alberto, who replaced the Rangers’ ailing veteran, Adrian Beltre, at third, let a routine grounder go through his legs, which gave way to a ground-rule double by Colabello and RBI single by Russ Martin, the former scoring the tying run as Kevin Pillar grounded into a double play with none out.\nThen both Hamels and Stroman seemed to settle in to a groove. Stroman retired 14 straight from the second through to a questionable two-out walk in the sixth, while Hamels retired eight of nine until Pillar reached out to bloop a desperation double into no-man’s land beyond first base, coming around to score on a sacrifice bunt and ground-ball single.\nMore on thestar.com\nHamstring injury could keep Buffalo Bills’ LeSean McCoy out another three games\nMaple Leafs-Senators: Game preview", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:06:33.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
