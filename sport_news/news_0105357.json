(Photo/John Corneau/Mill City Sports) \nLOWELL, Mass. — Another night of hockey between the UMass Lowell River Hawks and Merrimack College Warriors . Another tie for the Hockey East teams. The River Hawks and Warriors finished in a 1-1 tie at the Tsongas Center on Saturday night. \nAfter a weekend of hockey games between UMass Lowell and Merrimack, the two teams will skate away with two points in their first conference games of the season. \n“We were treated to a good hockey game tonight,” said UMass Lowell Head Coach Norm Bazin . “Both teams came out and had some urgency to their game for a second night. I think both teams are in better condition then last weekend. We started to generate some offense in the third period and in the overtime I thought we had one in us, just time ran out.” \nAfter a scoreless first period, Merrimack’s Brian Christie tallied the game’s first goal at 13:45 of the second period. However, the River Hawks would quickly knot the game back up when junior defenseman and co-captain Michael Kapla tallied his first goal of the season at 14:29. The only two goals of the game were scored in those 44 seconds. \nUMass Lowell was able to continue to kill off penalties (0-for-2), including a 5-on-3 in the second period and come out of Saturday night’s with a point to remain unblemished for the season. The River Hawks did however struggle to find the back of the net while on the power play (0-for-4). \n“I liked our penalty kill tonight. I thought the 5-on-3 was a very good turning point for us, it was a huge kill,” Bazin said. “We’re going to have to dissect the power play and start to get some more movement. I don’t think there’s enough puck movement to draw the opponent’s penalty kill in. Our releases were good, but I think we can do a better job with getting shots on net and cashing in on some rebounds.” \nUMass Lowell is 4-for-23 (17.4%) in five games this season on the power play, but wasn’t able to put one past Merrimack College over their two-game series (0-for-8). Succeeding on the penalty kill can help win games or in tonight’s case tie games, but not scoring on the power play isn’t a good slump to get into. Something will need to change if the River Hawks want to remain near the top this season. \nSenior goaltender Kevin Boyle stopped 22-of-23 shots for UMass Lowell on Saturday night and improved to (3-0-2) this season with a 0.97 goals-against average and .967 save percentage. \n“I think I’m seeing the puck pretty well,” said Boyle. “Obviously the team in front of me is doing a great job of keeping everything to the outside and allowing me to see the puck.” \nUMass Lowell next heads to Minnesota to face the No. 5 ranked Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs in a two-game non-conference matchup.
