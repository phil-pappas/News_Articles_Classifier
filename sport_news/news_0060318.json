This week the school is celebrating “tailgate week.”“We are trying to spotlight sports,” Pediatrics Plus Developmental Preschool director B.J. Arnold said. “So we asked ourselves, what local sports teams can we get to come and celebrate with our kids.”Community Christian School brought its cheerleaders on Tuesday. Russellville’s cheerleaders will visit the facility today.The Pirates brought football players, cheerleaders and band on Wednesday to perform an impromptu pep rally for the children in the parking lot of Pediatrics Plus.“They showed up in full force,” Arnold said. “So we made a big day of it.”Staff members and some children came to the rally dressed as pirates. Smith said the administration “didn’t even bat an eye” when he approached them about bringing two buses of high school students to Russellville.“These kids are so thrilled,” Arnold said. “We serve children primarily with special needs. Interaction with them is so key. Engagement is fundamental. Anytime people in the community spend time with them, it means the world to them.”Football players could be seen sitting among the children in the parking lot. Some hefted them up to see the marching band. One thick-armed, muscle bound player could be overhead: “I love these kids. These kids are adorable.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:27:21.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
