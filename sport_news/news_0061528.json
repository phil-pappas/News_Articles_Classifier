Here are the highlights and what to watch for during Saturday's contest.\nNo. 15 Texas A&M at No. 24 Ole Miss\nWhen: 6:00 p.m. Saturday\nRecords: Texas A&M (5-1, 2-1 SEC); Ole Miss (5-2, 2-1)\nLast meeting: No. 3 Ole Miss 35, No. 14 Texas A&M 20 on Oct 11, 2014\nTV: ESPN\nWhat's on the line?\nThis contest will operate much like an elimination game in the SEC West, with the loser kissing college football playoff hopes and likely the SEC title game goodbye. Not only will the winner stay alive in the division race, but will also claim their sixth victory of the season, good for a bowl game berth.\nBoth teams prefer the pass to the run. Rebels' quarterback Chad Kelly is the SEC leader in passing yards with the Aggies' Kyle Allen trailing behind in third. Ole Miss' Laquon Treadwell leads the conference in receiving yards at 654, but A&M's Christian Kirk is hot on his trail with 609.\nWatch for plenty of passing in a game both teams desperately need as a win in the record books to keep the goals set for 2015 within reach.\nWhen A&M has the ball\nThis should go without saying, but A&M must protect the ball better than it did last week to come away with a victory in this game, or any game left on the schedule this season. Allen can't be rattled by Ole Miss the same as he was with the Alabama defense that claimed three interceptions for touchdowns.\nThe Rebels are suffering from a multitude of injuries and simply put are just not as talented as the Tide, even with the head-to-head victory. Should Allen maintain his composure and limit turnovers, the Aggies have a good shot at returning home to College Station victorious.\nKirk has been phenomenal this season, averaging over 100 yards per game receiving and remains a constant threat on special teams.\nWhen Ole Miss has the ball\nThe Rebels rushing attack is virtually non-existent. Leading rusher Jaylen Walton has compiled only 331 yards this season on 58 carries. Fourth-year head coach Hugh Freeze knows the talent he has in Kelly and will provide every opportunity for his star quarterback to make things happen.\nThe Rebels claim one of the top-10 passing offenses in the country. However, A&M defensive coordinator John Chavis has excelled in preventing success through the air in his first year with the Aggies and will be aiming to limit the success of the Rebels' best offensive option.\nUnless Kelly and company build a lead so large that they turn their focus to running out the clock, plan to watch the pigskin travel through the air for the majority of the time Ole Miss is on offense.\nPrediction\nLast year, 5-0 became 5-3 for Texas A&M, with Ole Miss in the middle of losses to Mississippi State and Alabama. Sumlin has pushed that this is not the same team from last year, but after an embarrassing loss to the Tide, a victory would go a long way in reinforcing that statement. Despite their struggles at home, the Aggies have performed quite well under Sumlin in road games, particularly in Oxford.\nKirk and Allen hook up for another touchdown score during the contest, while the true freshman from Arizona shows off more of his skills in the special teams area as well. Turnovers make the game closer than it should play before A&M ultimately claims victory.\nScore: Texas A&M 30, Ole Miss 26\nA&M coverage: Predictions, analysis and more\nCLICK HERE TO VISIT THE TEXAS A&M AGGIES PAGE\nTexas A&M prediction: Passing expected to be plentiful in critical conference matchup with Ole Miss\nTexas A&M midseason grades: Special teams unit receives highest grade; Struggles at offensive line, linebacker\nWATCH: Alabama DB's pick six with hilarious 'crowd sourcing' perspective against Texas A&M\nFive things Texas A&M fans should know about Ole Miss; Virtual must win game in regards to SEC West contention\nTexas A&M midseason report: Allen offensive MVP, College Football Playoff still within reach\nHairopoulos: Texas A&M's Kyle Allen on 'toughest' part of three pick-six game against Alabama\nTexas A&M adds commitment from ex-Mississippi State DT signee T.D.
