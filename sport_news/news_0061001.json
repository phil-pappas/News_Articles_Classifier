Huh) Bears defensive backs coach Ed Donatell talks to his team during training camp Aug. 2 at Olivet Nazarene University in Bourbonnais. By NATE ATKINS natkins@chicagofootball.com \nHow does a secondary allow the sixth-fewest passing yards in the league yet also rank behind all but one team in opposing quarterback rating? \nThat might be the top question facing Bears defensive backs coach Ed Donatell as he heads into the bye week. The easy deduction would be that teams don’t throw on the Bears, and they do face the fourth-fewest passing attempts a game. \nBut the more performance-related figure is that the Bears have only three interceptions this season, tied for 25th in the league, and none from a cornerback through six games. \n“That’s awesome, because we can only get better,” he said to a room full of laughter. \nWhen Donatell met with the media Tuesday for the first time since training camp, he kept pointing to one area of improvement that’s no secret to observers: The Bears need to make better plays on the ball. \nSunday brought another example that resulted in a touchdown when Detroit’s Tim Wright caught a touchdown in the left corner of the end zone around Kyle Fuller, who had tight coverage but had his back turned. \n“We’re teaching them to shield and keep moving in that situation. If you look back, they’re just going to move away from you,” said Donatell, who has spent the past five years as defensive coordinator Vic Fangio’s defensive backs coach. \n“... All DBs, the rules are made to where they want you to play the football. We’re always preaching that to get your head around. Sometimes they’re just gonna play the pocket. But that’s what our goal is.” \nRookie safeties \ncontinue to grow \nDonatell knows he’s in a unique situation, starting two rookie safeties by Week 5. Harold Jones-Quartey went undrafted and didn’t sign with the team until Sept. 6, and fifth-round pick Adrian Amos has played only six full games as a safety in his life. \nDonatell credited the leadership of the injured Antrel Rolle and other veteran secondary players in bringing along Jones-Quartey, who had last played regular-season football at the University of Findlay before he took over for Rolle three weeks ago. Amos’ climb has been more gradual. \n“Amos, he’s just been so steady and mature beyond his years, and I mean 24/7 in everything he does, in every meeting. Very calm,” Donatell said. “You can see that he was listening to Antrel because when Antrel went out, there wasn’t as much drop-off in communication as there might be.” \nFluid cornerback situation \nDonatell didn’t get very specific with his cornerbacks, including the struggles Alan Ball has had to get on the field after injuring his groin after a big performance against the Seahawks in Week 3. Coach John Fox said Monday that Ball’s lack of snaps has not been related to his health, but Donatell emphasized the cornerback position is a fluid rotation with no roles set in stone. \nHe does see one player who has a chance to get the group’s first interception, a guy known for big interceptions in the playoffs: Tracy Porter. \n“He’s going to get a pick or two,” Donatell said. “They’re coming.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:28:46.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
