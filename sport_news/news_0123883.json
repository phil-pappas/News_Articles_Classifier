Adam Schiff, D-Calif., sang 'Meet the Mets' on the House floor on Friday after losing a bet. (C-SPAN) \nWatch the video on C-SPAN here . \nWASHINGTON (AP)– Losing a sports bet forced Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., to pay tribute to the New York Mets on the House floor–in song. \n“Meet the Mets, step right up and greet the Mets,” Schiff crooned on Friday, a bit off-key after his Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the Mets in baseball’s playoffs. \n“Mr. Speaker, please tell me my time has expired,” Schiff pleaded with the presiding officer in hopes of ending the ordeal. \nSchiff and Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y., had made a wager on the series that involved gourmet popcorn, bagels and the requirement that the loser toast the winning team on the House floor. \nSchiff got in a dig at New York’s other baseball team at the end of his remarks. \n“Thank God the Mets are going to the World Series and not the Yankees,” he said.
