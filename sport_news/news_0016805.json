Manning took the Broncos from their 12 to the Cleveland 16 before McManus kicked his game-winner to make Denver 6-0 for the seventh time in franchise history. The Broncos only rallied thanks to their top-ranked defense, which came up big in overtime. After Manning's third pick, Denver recorded two sacks to push the Browns (2-4) out of field-goal range. Given another chance, Manning took over. He completed 4 of 4 passes for 39 yards on the last drive. The extra period came after a frenetic fourth quarter during which Cleveland took the lead on an interception return only to have Manning take it back 14 seconds later with a 75-yard touchdown pass.
