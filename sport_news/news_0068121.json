Martina Hingis , now in the third reiteration of her career, has won five Grand Slam doubles titles (three mixed with Leander Paes and two women’s with Sania Mirza ) and another six tour titles in 2015, earning more than $1.3 million in prize money. “Santina,” their new, crowd-sourced nickname, have practically been unstoppable since first partnering in March of this year, immediately winning their first three outings. Mirza climbed to the No. 1 ranking in doubles for the first time along the way, also adding her maiden doubles Slam title. Most recently, the pair claimed the China Open trophy to mark their fourth doubles title in a row. Mirza took some time off after Beijing and Hingis continued playing, partnering with Chinese player Han Xinyun at the Tianjin Open, but lost in the first round.\nWhile in Beijing, following a 1–6, 6–4, 10–6 second round victory over Flavia Pennetta and Sara Errani with partner Mirza, Martina Hingis sat down with contributor James Pham in a special to SI.com to talk comebacks, prize money, social media and more.\nSI.com: Even when you and Sania aren’t playing well, you’re winning. You said at the U.S. Open that you felt “invincible.”\nMartina Hingis: Well, there we were playing well! [laughs] When you’re on a winning streak, you have this belief that you’re eventually going to come back and find the winning solution. [In the second round match vs. Pennetta/Errani], Flavia [was] just coming off so much confidence winning the U.S. Open. So it was definitely there already a tough match; it was the semifinals at the U.S. Open [where Hingis/Mirza defeated Pennetta/Errani 6–4, 6–1]. And now we played a first round, well second round, but we had a bye. So we had three, four days off and all of a sudden they played two matches, a singles and a doubles, and we’re like, “Oy!” We had to adjust to that a little bit and we found a way.\nTennis Comeback queen Martina Hingis wins fifth major doubles title of the year by Elizabeth Newman", "external_links": ["http://www.wtatennis.com/news/article/5035063/title/hingis-mirza-get-a-new-team-name", "http://flyicarusfly.com/"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:38:51.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
