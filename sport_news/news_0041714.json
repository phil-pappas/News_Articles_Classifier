Today's question: What do they do about the Eugenio Suarez/Zack Cozart situation? \nCincinnati Reds shortstop Eugenio Suarez (7) throws to first base for an out in the seventh inning during the MLB game between the New York Mets and the Cincinnati Reds, Thursday, Sept. 24, 2015, at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati, Ohio. (Photo: The Enquirer/Kareem Elgazzar) \nNo. 1: How do Reds fix the bullpen? \nOther than make sure Suarez has an outfielder's glove for spring training, nothing. \nIf Cozart proves he's healthy after that horrendous knee injury, he gives the Reds great value because he's one of the best defensive shortstops in the game. He was also having a turnaround year offensively when he got hurt. Cozart's confident he'll be healthy. \"Not just for the season, but spring training as well,\" he said. \nSuarez looks to be the better offensive player. He hit .280 with 13 home runs, 19 doubles and 48 RBI in just over half a season. (By the way, the Reds got the best production out of shortstop of any team in the National League: 86 RBI, .757 on-base plus slugging). Suarez's power comes as surprise to Reds \nWith left field basically open and Suarez willing to try it, the Reds have to look at keeping him in the lineup. But at the same time, they shouldn't give up on him as a shortstop or second baseman. A middle infield bat like his is too valuable. \nAs for 2016, let it work itself out. If Cozart's healthy and hitting, make Suarez a super utility. Having too many good players is never a problem. \nLook at the Chicago Cubs. Kyle Schwarber, the right fielder in Wednesday's Wild Card win against the Pirates , had 14 innings of total experience in right field. If the Cubs were worried about defense, they might be sitting at home right now. \nJoe Maddon, widely considered one of the game's best managers, has players switch positions like it's Sunday morning softball. \nAnd, remember, the last time the Reds were really good, 2012, they had a super-utility guy. Todd Frazier started 66 games at third, 36 games at first, seven games in left field and one game in right field. (He played second and short in 2011). Reds' Price hints Cozart, Suarez will be 'regulars' \nThe Reds would have never won 97 games in '12 if they didn't have Frazier to fill in for Joey Votto and Scott Rolen. \nSomeone is going to get hurt next year. You don't know who, you don't know when, but it happens to virtually every team virtually every year. You can't avoid it, but having a good player like Suarez to fill in goes a long way toward overcoming it. \nThe difference between Frazier and Suarez is Frazier played all over the place in the minors. But both started out as shortstops. Suarez is athletic enough to play left. He's played some third in the majors. Playing second would be an easy adjustment. \nOne of the things that was puzzling to me is why the Reds didn't at least try Suarez in left down the stretch. \nBut I suspect they'll have him out there in spring training. And I suspect they'll play him at third - and second some as well. If he's OK at the new spots, just let things work themselves out for 2016.
