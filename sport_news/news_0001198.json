FOOTBALL: Weymouth rallies past Braintree, 35-21 Weymouth quarterback Matt Long scored three of his five touchdowns in the span of four minutes in the third quarter Friday night as the Wildcats reeled off 21 straight points to pull off a 35-21 come-from-behind win over Braintree. Comment By Mark DucharmeFor The Patriot Ledger Posted Oct. 23, 2015 at 10:41 pm Updated at 10:55 PM WEYMOUTH – The third quarter proved to be too Long as far as the Braintree High football team was concerned. Weymouth senior quarterback Matt Long scored three of his five touchdowns in the span of four minutes in the third quarter Friday night as the Wildcats reeled off 21 straight points to pull off a 35-21 come-from-behind win over Braintree. “My line came through for me big-time in the third quarter,” said Long. “We are hoping we can build off this as we move forward.” Weymouth (4-3, 3-2 Bay State Conference Carey Division) is expecting a berth in the Division 1 South Sectional playoffs. Braintree’s Dan Valicenti started the third quarter with a 57-yard TD run to give the Wamps (3-4, 2-3) a 21-14 lead. But the rest of the period belonged to Long ... and his defense. Long first capped off a 76-yard scoring drive with a 34-yard TD run. He then kicked the PAT to tie the game at 21-all. The defense then forced back-to-back turnovers, and Weymouth cashed in on both takeaways with two more Long scoring runs. The first was a 40-yarder after a Bobby Downing fumble recovery at the Braintree 40. The second came after a Zach Jones fumble recovery at the Wamps’ 15. This time it took two plays for Long to score, on a 5-yard run for a 35-21 lead. “I just tried to be around the football the best I can,” said Downing, who has three fumble recoveries and three INTs this season. “That was one of our best defensive periods of the season.” Both teams were able to run the ball and come up with big drives as they battled to a 14-14 stalemate by halftime. The Wamps drove 80 yards on their first possession behind the running of Drew Caruso and Valicenti. That set up Mitchell Nevins’ 20-yard touchdown pass to Justin Dutcher. Ryan Costello kicked the PAT for a 7-0 Braintree lead. The key play on the drive was a fourth-down pass-interference call against Weymouth. Weymouth came back with a 66-yard scoring drive that was capped off with Long’s 1-yard run. He added the PAT to tie the game at 7-7. The Weymouth captain set up the TD with a 32-yard pass to Scheron Cunningham and a 17-yard pass to Kevin Lyons. Braintree answered 17 seconds later as Caruso bolted 69 yards untouched. Costello’s PAT made it 14-7 Braintree. Weymouth replied with a seven-minute, 76-yard drive, capped by Long’s 5-yard TD run on fourth-and-2. Long’s PAT knotted the score at 14-all with 21 seconds left in the first half. Pahj Augustin had a first-half interception for Braintree at his own 45, but the takeaway did not lead to any points.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:26:19.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
