Rahane, who has two centuries and 10 half-centuries from 58 ODIs, didn’t figure in the lost Twenty 20 series. It copped a lot of criticism for Dhoni but he was categorical in stating on Sunday that the strokeplayer’s game was not cut out for the lower order. With Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli taking the top three places, Rahane would find it difficult to find a place in the line-up. Rahane had last played in the ODIs during the series against Zimbabwe, where he had captained a depleted side.“If you see in the last few series we’ve played, we always felt that Rahane is somebody who should bat more up the order. Batting down -- 5, 6 and 7 -- he’ll face more difficulties. We’ve seen he’s more flamboyant, more free, when he bats up the order, with a bit of field restrictions. Once he gets a good start, then he capitalise in the middle overs also,” Dhoni told reporters on the eve of first ODI.“Even to an extent, No 4 is quite low for him. Opening is a slot that fits him really well. It’s slightly difficult for him as of now especially if I am looking for somebody to bat at 5, 6 and 7. I don’t think he’s the person to bat there. Given a chance, we’ll try to feature him in the top three, but if not, he’ll find it difficult to feature.”Dhoni said they were looking for someone who can bat in lower order besides improving their death bowling. “What we’re looking for is somebody who can bat down the order. Also, death bowling is something that is very crucial. The bowlers will get a bit of respite because of the new rules -- they’ll have that one extra fielder outside, which means they will bowl like a T20 game after the 40th over, with that extra fielder outside,” Dhoni said.\"But overall, it’s very difficult to just look for solutions. You also have to look at the series, because you want the series. ”The return of Umesh Yadav, Dhoni admitted, would boost the bowling but pointed out the need for consistency. “We have emphasized a lot on pace, but what is crucial is to exploit the condition. Umesh is definitely somebody who can bowl quick for us. Over the years, we’ve seen he gives us very good performances, but at the same time, he has a few on-and-off days. Hopefully, a bit more games and exposure will help him. We’ve seen once he bowls well, he bowls really well. We’ll have to try and keep him in that spectrum so that he’s an asset to the side.”Dhoni didn’t deny the possibility of fielding three spinners on Sunday. “This is one venue we can. We’ll have a look at the wicket, how dry it is, and the chances of it breaking up and assisting the spinners. But definitely, with no dew, three-spinner option is available to us. It’s a bit of an early start, we’ve to keep that in mind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T18:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:40:55.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
