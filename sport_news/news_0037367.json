(Brad Horrigan / Hartford Courant) Jeff Jacobs Contact Reporter Jeff Jacobs \nEAST HARTFORD — With slightly over two minutes left in a game that demonstrated how far UConn football has come this year and how far it still needs to go, the Huskies had 501 offensive yards and 13 points on the scoreboard. \nDid turnovers kill them? Hardly. They had one. \n\"I really like points, we need more points,\" coach Bob Diaco said after a 28-20 conference loss to South Florida on Saturday at Rentschler Field. \nThe Huskies brought the easel for this homecoming game. They brought a pallet with the full range of colors. They had the blue-gray sky and autumn landscape painted. They had the handsome beau done. Series after series, they were ready for that final brush stroke. \nSo what happened? They smudged the face of the beautiful girl. Over and over and over again. \n\"Tough time finishing,\" Diaco said. \nCouldn't finish, didn't finish, and eventually the Huskies were finished. (DESMOND CONNER) \nBryant Sheriffs threw for 365 yards, ran for 100 more, and only once in UConn football history had anybody produced more total yards. Casey Cochran, 461 yards passing and five yards rumbling and tumbling, ran up 45 points on Memphis in the final game of the 2013 season. \n\"It's pretty frustrating,\" Shirreffs said. \"In the big scheme of things, yards don't really matter when you're not putting up points.\" \nIn the little scheme of things, it is also true. \nAs Diaco walked into the interview room and settled at the podium, this thought flashed through my mind. We don't need the big picture today. We don't need the happy horsefeathers about the grills being stoked at 7:30 a.m. We don't need the stuff about another coat of paint being applied. \nThe Huskies took on USF at Rentschler Field Saturday in the 2015 homecoming game. \nAnd to his credit, Diaco had none of it. Never was he more candid, more poignant, more emotionally and intellectually honest. \nA win here would have lifted the Huskies to a 4-3 record for the first time since 2009, although it should be pointed out that Randy Edsall rallied the 2010 team big-time into the BCS Fiesta Bowl. A win here would have put UConn in good stead for at least a 6-6 finish and bowl eligibility for the first time since Edsall walked into that dark Arizona night. Now we have to wait to see how much damage has been done by this stinging defeat. \nA victory here would have quantified exactly how far Diaco has come, and he knew it. This game was in his grasp, and he knew that, too. Before he spoke a word, Diaco threw the paper with all the numbers on it to the side. His eyes were red. \n\"Pitch the stat sheet, because it's not relevant,\" Diaco said. \"It's a bizarre read. I take full responsibility, full accountability. It's a sad, hard loss. I saw that student section packed; they all came out. I just feel terrible I let them down.\" \nDiaco said he didn't have his team fully ready. He went on to talk about how the defense was not its usual force, missing tackles, allowing some explosive plays. And while two Quinton Flowers 44-yard touchdown passes to Rodney Adams and D'Ernest Johnson's 29-yard option TD pass to Adams certainly speak to Diaco's point, they didn't speak directly to the main point. \nAnd while Diaco talked about some problems on special teams, including Brian Lemelle's failing to field a punt that bounced for 68 yards and an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on Jazzmar Clax that wiped out much of a long Arkeel Newsome kickoff return, again it didn't speak directly to the main point. \nDiaco knew that, too. Twelve of the 13 UConn drives ended in USF territory. You amass 528 total yards and 34:51 of possession, the ball has to go to somewhere good. \n\"We didn't spend a whole lot of time punting from deep in our territory,\" Diaco said. \nActually, no time at all. \nThe difference was third-and-1 and fourth-and-1 at the USF 8 on the first drive. A Newsome run was snuffed. A Shirreffs run was snuffed. \nThe difference was first-and-goal at the USF 7 in the second quarter after USF's only score of the first half yet coming away with only a Bobby Puyol field goal. \nThe difference was a Shirreffs sack by Demetrius Hill with 18 seconds left in the first half and instead of calling a timeout, deciding to spike it and allowing the clock to get down to 8 seconds. The real difference, however, was a play that never should have happened, where Newsome caught a pass and wasn't in position to get out of bounds. The first half expired with no points on the drive. \nHorrible. \nTom Brady can pull that off. Fine. Can take that chance with 8 seconds. Not UConn. Not in 2015. Too many things can go wrong. Look, columnists are fully equipped with second-guess goggles. But believe me, that one was a first guess. \n\"We felt like we had the right thing for the right moment, a four-second play called that ended up being an eight-second play,\" Diaco said. \"So we need to eliminate the opportunity that a four-second play could become an eight-second play. Time out. Kick the field goal. Of course. \n\"We need to do a better job making sure as we look to prepare for these critical situations that they are tight, as tight as tight can be.\" \nShirreffs added more detail. He said the pass was supposed to go into the end zone so the clock wouldn't be an issue. \nWould I have gone for it on fourth down on the first drive? Yes. Didn't like the two play calls, though. Would have loved the use of the tight ends, Alec Bloom or Tommy Myers, right there. \nDid I have a problem with going for the Puyol field goal with 12:27 left in the game instead of going for a first down on fourth-and-a long 1 at the USF 27? Others did. I didn't. I do understand the argument, though. My caveat? The kick had to be good. Puyol hit the upright from 44. \nThe larger point is there has been a huge chunk of third-and-1, fourth-and-1 plays through this season where UConn has gone for it and missed. Each one of the calls, Diaco has offered his rationale, and he has made some sense. Yet taken in toto, Diaco and offensive coordinator Frank Verducci have been so daring at times and so conservative at others that it leaves your head spinning. \nMake no mistake. Diaco has changed the culture for the better. Diaco has built the foundation for the better. So much looks so much better, and that includes an offense that has been built to move the ball. It just can't finish. You look at games like Army, where UConn had 415 yards and only 22 points, and Navy, where the Huskies had 325 yards and only 18 points. \nYou take six of the seven games and you see 340 average yards and only 16.5 average points. At this point, the 40 giddy points against UCF is the outlier. On this day, the Huskies had a whopping 16 plays of at least 16 yards and four of at least 33. Shirreffs was the first quarterback in UConn history to throw for more than 300 yards and run for 100 — he had more yards than the entire USF offense — yet until he hit Tyraiq Beals for a 27-yard TD with 2:11 left, the Huskies barely broke 10 on the scoreboard. \n\"We have to do a better job as a staff having a higher level of play awareness and play selection,\" Diaco said. \"I don't have a 40,000-feet-looking-down comment for you right now. I'm not trying to give you coachspeak. I know we're going to have to look down at the third-and-1, the fourth-and-1 and say, 'Why was this play not successful? Should it even have been called? What's a better play selection here?' \n\"Really be honest. Start with myself and move on down through the staff to give us a better opportunity to keep the drive alive and produce points. We need to do a better job as a staff to find ways to be successful in critical situations.\" \nDiaco insisted his players are good enough. He insisted his coaches are smart enough. So many times the Huskies are one brush stroke away from a work of athletic art and they ruin the picture. \n\"We've got to finish those moments, and there's definitely an answer,\" Diaco said. \"We're going to find more answers.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:52:22.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
