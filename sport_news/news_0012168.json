They met for the first time last year, with Regina pulling out the win, one of the Regals’ 76 victories in the last 77 games. This test will be welcomed by the Regals, who have steamrolled through their district competition. Regina’s 49.6 points per game leads 1A teams. Nick Phillips is a two-way star, rushing for 617 yards, catching 20 passes for 337 yards and intercepting five passes. Xavier already owns its district title. Maliki Wilson has rushed for 749 yards and nine touchdowns. \nCEDAR FALLS at CEDAR RAPIDS KENNEDY \nWhen and where: 7:15 p.m. Friday, at Kingston Stadium \nTV: KCRG 9.2 \nRecords and rankings: Cedar Falls is 5-2 overall, 2-1 Class 4A District 5; No. 4 Kennedy is 7-0, 3-0. \nOverview: The best regular season in Kennedy history can become a district-championship season if the Cougars defeat Cedar Falls. Kennedy’s defense ranks No. 2 in Class 4A, allowing just 10.7 points per game, and the Cougars have surrendered only 20 points in the last five games. Tyler Dralle ranks second among 4A backs with 1,157 yards (with 13 touchdowns), and has gone over the 2,000-yard career mark. Cedar Falls stumbled at home last week against Linn-Mar, 31-24, but can reclaim control of the district with a mild upset. \nCEDAR RAPIDS WASHINGTON at IOWA CITY HIGH \nWhen and where: 7:15 p.m. Friday, at Bates Field \nRecords and rankings: No. 5 Washington is 6-1 overall, 3-0 Class 4A District 6; City High is 5-2, 3-0. \nOverview: The 4A-6 champion will be crowned this week on the Bates Field grass. City High has enjoyed a bounce-back season and is on a five-game winning string. Jason Jones is one of the top receivers in Class 4A, with 40 receptions for 703 yards and eight touchdowns. Washington has its own playmaker in Isaiah Nimmers (28 catches, 579 yards, nine TDs — and also three interceptions). O’Rien Vance spearheads the Warriors’ defense with 57 tackles (17 for loss) and a fumble recovery. \nMUSCATINE at CEDAR RAPIDS PRAIRIE \nWhen and where: 7:15 p.m. Friday, at John Wall Field \nRecords and rankings: No. 9 Muscatine is 6-1 overall, 2-1 Class 4A District 6; Prairie is 2-5, 1-2. \nOverview: A win probably would make Prairie eligible for the playoffs; if not, the Hawks will take their hopes to a Week 9 game vs. Ottumwa. Tyler Nunemaker has passed for 852 yards and eight touchdowns. Muscatine is a prolific outfit; the Muskies’ 38.6-point average ranks third in Class 4A. Luke Wichers has 1,243 passing yards and 11 touchdowns to his credit. Four receivers have at least 13 receptions. \nWATERLOO WEST at LINN-MAR \nWhen and where: 7:15 p.m. Friday, at Linn-Mar Stadium \nRecords and rankings: West is 3-4 overall, 1-2 Class 4A District 5; Linn-Mar is 3-4, 2-1. Both are unranked. \nOverview: Linn-Mar pulled one of the biggest surprises in 4A football this fall, knocking off Cedar Falls, 31-24, last week. As a reward, the Lions can clinch a playoff berth this week with a win, and would host a first-round game if they win out. Quarterback Reese Phillips is ninth in 4A in passing yards (1,206) and has thrown for 11 touchdowns. Speedster Daniel Gorsich has 36 catches for 541 yards and seven TDs. West’s Trey Burt has caught 41 passes for 666 yards. \nCEDAR RAPIDS JEFFERSON at WATERLOO EAST \nWhen and where: 7:15 p.m. Friday, at Waterloo \nRecords and rankings: Jefferson is 4-3 overall, 1-2 Class 4A District 5; East is 0-7, 0-3. Both are unranked. \nOverview: Jefferson is on the doorstep of a winning regular season and a second straight playoff appearance. The J-Hawks rattled Waterloo West, 44-15, last week, and are heavily favored to complete a two-week sweep of Waterloo. Valentino Green is a valuable cog on both sides of the ball — he has rushed for 398 yards, is averaging nearly 20 yards per catch and has a pair of interceptions to his credit. East has been held without a touchdown on four occasions this season. \nIOWA CITY WEST at DAVENPORT NORTH \nWhen and where: 7:15 p.m. Friday, at Davenport \nRecords and rankings: West is 2-5 overall, 2-0 Class 4A District 7; North is 1-6, 1-2. Both are unranked. \nOverview: Despite the 2-5 record, West can set up a Week 9 winner-take-all battle with Pleasant Valley for the district title if it takes care of the Wildcats. The Trojans have faced the toughest non-district schedule in 4A, and it’s starting to pay off. Much of the credit goes to a strong passing attack. Alex Henderson ranks fourth in 4A with 1,634 passing yards, with Oliver Martin and Devontae Lane getting most of the looks at receiver. There’s a very good possibility that North will finish 1-8 and still make the playoffs. \nINDEPENDENCE at WEST DELAWARE \nWhen and where: 7:30 p.m. Friday, at Manchester \nRecords and rankings: No. 6 Independence is 7-0 overall, 5-0 Class 3A District 3; No. 2 West Delaware is 7-0, 4-0. \nOverview: One of the season’s premier matchups has arrived. The top two rushers will be on display. West Delaware’s Coy Roussell leads the way with 1,450 yards and 19 touchdowns. He is averaging just short of 10 yards per carry. Nicholas Holt of Indee is second with 1,203 yards and 19 touchdowns. Nobody has really solved West Delaware’s diverse offense, which averages a 3A-best 43.9 points per game. In addition to Roussell, the Hawks have one of the state’s best passing tandems in Max Ridenour (1,390 yards, 17 touchdowns) and Sam Maloney (21 catches, 718 yards, 11 TDs). Holt has thrown for 1,088 yards, giving him 2,291 yards of total offense and 29 touchdowns. \nBGM at COLFAX-MINGO \nWhen and where: 7 p.m. Friday, at Colfax \nRecords and rankings: Top-rated BGM is 7-0 overall, 5-0 Class A District 7; Colfax-Mingo is 6-1, 5-0. \nOverview: After drubbing its first five district opponents by a combined margin of 302-50, BGM faces an increased strength of schedule down the stretch — road tests against Colfax-Mingo and Montezuma to conclude the regular season. The Bears have an explosive guy in Jayce Knight. Ten of his 19 receptions have gone for touchdowns, and he has taken three punt returns and two kickoffs the distance. Colfax-Mingo counters with quarterback Jared Myers, who leads all classes in passing yards, with 2,113. Myers has completed 64 percent of his passes for 24 touchdowns against just five interceptions. \nWILTON at WEST BRANCH \nWhen and where: 6:30 p.m. Friday, at West Branch \nRecords and rankings: Wilton is 4-3 overall, 4-0 Class 1A District 5; No. 3 West Branch is 7-0, 4-0. \nOverview: Wilton tripped up previously unbeaten Alburnett last week, making this the pivotal game of the stretch run in 1A-5. West Branch running back Luke Lenoch is churning up the yards again — he has 1,125 on 120 carries, with 18 rushing touchdowns. Quarterback Cooper Koenig has completed 61 percent of his passes; he’s got 1,089 passing yards and 11 TDs. Wilton has recovered from a rough start, winning four of its last five games and is spotless in district play. Beavers QB Javin Drake has 1,096 passing yards to his name. \nCASCADE at MOUNT VERNON \nWhen and where: 7 p.m. Friday, at Mount Vernon \nRecords and rankings: Cascade is 4-3 overall, 3-1 Class 2A District 4; No. 9 Mount Vernon is 5-2, 3-1. \nOverview: Last year’s district champion, Cascade has somewhat quietly moved into contention again, and can repeat as the champ if it wins out. It will be a challenge, though, because the Cougars close with ranked foes Mount Vernon and Anamosa. Cascade has won three games this season by five points or less, including a 38-33 victory over Monticello last week. Mount Vernon will try to bounce back after giving up a two-touchdown lead in the fourth quarter of last week’s 45-42 loss to Anamosa. Mustangs QB Drew Adams threw for 376 yards and four touchdowns last week and has 1,436 passing yards this season \nNEW HAMPTON at DYERSVILLE BECKMAN \nWhen and where: 7:30 p.m. Friday, at Dyersville \nRecords and rankings: Both teams are 4-3 overall, 3-1 Class 2A District 3. Both are unranked. \nOverview: This is one of two games — the other is at Waukon, where the Indians host Center Point-Urbana — that will go a long way toward determining the pecking order of five strong teams in this district. Beckman is peaking at a wonderful time; the Blazers tripped North Fayette Valley in Week 6, then whipped Waterloo Columbus, 53-3, last week. The Chickasaws, meanwhile, are coming off a 46-13 loss to Waukon. New Hampton’s Alex Heying is among the 2A leaders in fumble recoveries, with three. \nOTHER GAMES INVOLVING METRO/IOWA CITY TEAMS \nMarion (0-7 overall, 0-4 Class 3A District 4) at Dubuque Wahlert (2-5, 2-2), 7:15 p.m. Friday \nCedar Valley Christian (1-6 overall, 0-5 8-Player District 4) at Turkey Valley (5-2, 4-1), 7 p.m. Friday, LaSalle Middle School \n* * * * * \nThe Gazette/KCRG/KGYM ranked teams — who and where they play.
