The president back then (Sam Taylor) said, ‘Ah, let’s have a drink,’ and he bought us drinks. \n“I felt like a little kid. I was crying. I was so (peeved) off. I said, ‘What the hell did I do?’ And I had signed for a year. I said, ‘Holy Christmas, what did I get into here?’ ” \nHe ultimately got into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame, as a member of the shrine’s Class of 1996. Five years earlier, he had entered the Riders’ shrine, the Plaza of Honor. \nIt was an honour to know him. My shortest conversation with him lasted an hour. One fine day, he even sent along a handwritten note, just to express appreciation for a Leader-Post series commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Roughriders’ first Grey Cup victory — a 29-14 victory over the Ottawa Rough Riders in 1966. \nThe game was tied 14-14 at halftime, after which the Roughriders — and especially their star-studded offensive line — took over. \nTed Urness was the centre. Benecick and Jack Abendschan were the guards. All three of them are in the Hall of Fame. \nThe tackles, Reg Whitehouse and Clyde Brock, are immortalized in the Plaza of Honor. \nThat quintet provided airtight protection for quarterback Ron Lancaster and opened holes for fullback George Reed and tailback Ed Buchanan on Nov. 26, 1966 at Empire Stadium in Vancouver. \nLancaster threw three touchdown passes, including the eventual game-winner to Hugh Campbell on the opening play of the fourth quarter. Reed effectively cemented the outcome with a 31-yard touchdown run. The final half of the fourth frame was a formality. \n“We were sad the game ended,” Benecick recalled. “Sometimes you can’t wait until they end and you’re glad it’s over, but we were sad that one ended. We could have kept going and going and going. It was a wonderful feeling.” \nIn 1966, Benecick had been named a CFL all-star guard for the third consecutive season. He was also decorated as a Western Conference all-star tackle in 1963 before changing positions. \nHe was a mainstay on the offensive line through the 1968 season, at which point he announced his intent to retire. The Oyster Bay, N.Y., product did so via a typewritten letter he sent to Laurie Artiss, who was the Leader-Post’s sports editor at the time. \n“I would appreciate if you would publicly thank the people of Regina and the province for their support and their friendliness to me and my family for the past 10 years,” wrote Benecick who, according to Artiss, was the longest-serving American-born player in Roughriders history at the time. \n“We have found Regina a nice place to live and intend to make it our home.” \nBut first, Benecick extended his career by four games as a member of the 1969 Eskimos — signing off as a player in the very city where, one October night in 1959, he first suited up in the Canadian professional football ranks. \nFrom Edmonton, he moved to Ottawa and then to Florida, but the allure of Saskatchewan was irresistible. \n“I stayed down there (in Florida) for a number of years,” Benecick remembered in 2006. “I was in the real estate business. It got too hot for me, especially in the summertime. I could hardly walk on the pavement. So I put two and two together and thought, ‘Where did I have the most fun? Where are the people the nicest?’ So I came back to Canada and I’m happy I did. \n“I stayed here because there’s a comfort zone. When I first came here, people were nice. Cars stopped. It was, ‘Come over here for a meal.’ It was how things used to be in New York.” \nBenecick moved back to Regina in the mid-1980s and spent the next 15 years working for the Saskatchewan Property Management Corporation. He lived in a downtown apartment and embraced the simple things in life during the final years he spent in Regina. \n“The summers here are pretty neat,” he said in an interview for West Riders Best, my book on the 1966 championship team. “I stay because things are convenient. I don’t have a car. I use a bicycle, or else a bus in inclement weather. It’s only a block or two for shopping. The university’s close by. The hospital’s close by. The doctor’s close by. Everything I want is close by. I’m comfortable here. Regina’s a great place. \n“A lot of people say, ‘Where the hell is that?’ I enjoy hearing that. We’ll keep it that way.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:37:57.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
