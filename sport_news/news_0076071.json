His heart skipped a beat when Shreyas was dropped by Barinder Singh Sran at mid-wicket on 195.\nIyer, who is a property consultant, had a couple of meetings scheduled but wanted to see his son score the double ton. “I didn’t want to miss his maiden double century,” he said.\nWhen he reached 200, Shreyas waved his bat to his father and friends seated in the MCA Pavilion. And when he returned to the pavilion, Iyer Jr waved to his father. This time the thumbs ups were not over WhatsApp. Mission accomplished.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:46:14.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
