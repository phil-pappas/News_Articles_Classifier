West Delaware won 13-9. (Jim Slosiarek/The Gazette) Most Popular October 17, 2015 | 11:01 am \nMANCHESTER – Coy Roussell hadn’t experienced so much excitement on the football field. \nOf course, it helps when you rush for the decisive touchdown for a victory over a ranked rival. \nRoussell broke his longest run for a 42-yard touchdown late in the fourth quarter to elevate the third-ranked Hawks over No. 6 Independence, 13-9, in a hard-fought, defensive battle Friday night at Brown Field. West Delaware claimed the Class 3A District 3 title with the win and Decorah’s loss to Charles City. \n“This was a great game to be in,” Roussell said. “It was a great atmosphere. It was one of the most fun games I’ve ever played.” \nThe Hawks (8-0, 5-0) had struggled to move the ball and had held Roussell to 53 yards before he broke the touchdown for the four-point lead with 3:41 left in the fourth quarter. West Delaware started its winning drive at the Independence 48. Two plays later, Roussell broke free and then down the left sideline, getting a key downfield block from Sam Maloney. \nOnce he cleared that block, he knew he was home free. \n“There was so much emotion going through me,” said Roussell, who rushed for 95 yards to give him 1,545 for the season. “I knew I just had to take it to the house. That was my goal.” \nThe Hawks opened the game with a 72-yard touchdown drive for a 6-0 lead. Max Ridenour capped it with a 4-yard TD. The defense had to keep West Delaware in the game, because the offense couldn’t move the ball in the first half and stalled multiple drives in Independence territory after the break. \nThe Hawks defense shut out Independence in the second half, securing the win with late interceptions from Owen Ward and the final one from Ridenour. \n“I did not expect that to be a defensive battle,” West Delaware Coach Doug Winkowitsch said. “I’m just so proud of our kids for sticking with it, and when we needed a big play we got it out of Coy. \n“We got in the red zone probably three or four times and didn’t punch it in. Our defense stayed strong and kept us in the ball game.” \nIndependence’s defense dominated the opening half. The Mustangs (7-1, 5-1) limited West Delaware to just 93 total yards with 72 coming on the Hawks’ first-possession touchdown drive. Independence forced six straight 3-and-outs, ending the first half on a sack. \n“I think the positive is that’s the best our defense has played all year, and I wouldn’t say it is close,” Independence Coach Justin Putz said. “We’re not really a moral victory team. We feel we can do a lot of good things.” \nThe Mustangs’ dual-threat QB Nicholas Holt entered the game with 2,291 total yards, including 1,203 rushing. His big-play ability shined when he tucked the ball on a QB read and bolted 63 yards for a TD, tying the score 6-6 in the first quarter. \nHolt finished with 188 rushing yards and 112 through the air. \nThey converted with 2:44 left to play in the first half. Independence drove inside West Delaware’s 10. Mark Thompson connected on a 25-yard field goal for a 9-6 halftime lead. \nAccording to Winkowitsch, the test came at a good time, preparing the team for postseason battles. \n“I’m real ecstatic,” Winkowitsch said. “We’re going to enjoy this one and then get after the next one.” \nl Comments: (319) 368-8679; kj.pilcher@thegazette.com Your Next Prep Football Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:06:56.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
