One person is usually not able to do this on his or her own, especially when the deer needs to be transferred to a truck bed. Also, conventional deer carts break relatively easily and are inadequate for loading onto trucks. \"In order to solve this problem we developed our design,\" said one of two inventors from Cheektowaga, N.Y. They then created a prototype of the DEER SLAYER, which enables a user to transport a game deer from a hunting site in a quick, efficient and ergonomic manner. It eliminates the need for assistance, and it facilitates transfer to a truck. It also can be used for other hauling purposes. As a result, it avoids strain and hassle, as well as saves time and effort.\nThe original design was submitted to the Telemarketing office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
