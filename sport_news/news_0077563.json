Kansas City held Minnesota to just 84 yards on the ground, including 60 yards on 26 carries by running back Adrian Peterson. \nMinnesota wide receiver Stefon Diggs, starting in place of injured Charles Johnson, went over the 100-yard mark for the first time in his career, catching seven passes for 129 yards. \nSmith was 22-of-37 through the air with 282 yards and a score. \nKelce hauled in five passes for 88 yards. \nNOTES: Chiefs DT Dontari Poe was inactive with a high ankle sprain. ...
