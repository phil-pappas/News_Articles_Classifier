Higgins stepped down from her position at Woodland Hills on Feb. 24, about a month after Woodland Hills police found her in a parked car with a student at night, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \nHiggins submitted a resignation letter to Ambridge Area's board in mid-September, district solicitor Hobart Webster said. \nThe district hired Higgins on the condition that her background check and other clearances came back clean, Webster said. She submitted her resignation before the board would have been able to take action on any results, he said. \nThe board does not currently have any interviews scheduled for Higgins’ position, he said. \nThe board also voted Wednesday to appoint Mariah Passarelli, of Esquire and Buchanan, Ingersoll & Rooney PC, to investigate a district personnel issue. \n“The district takes every complaint seriously,” Webster said, although he could not comment on the nature of the investigation or the parties involved.
