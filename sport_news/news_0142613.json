By Ryan Mahan , Staff Writer Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 8:33 PM Updated at 10:34 PM • A look at what's ahead Friday in Week 6 in the CS8 ROCHESTER — Kenny Hedges nearly had his football career ended by a broken back his freshman year. Now that back is strong enough to put Rochester High School’s lofty goal of a sixth straight Class 4A state football championship on it, and the senior running back is trying to help carry the Rockets to DeKalb. In his first varsity game, Hedges fractured two vertebrae in the lumbar area of the spine. He was out for the rest of that season, recuperating. Hedges also sat out his sophomore season, heeding his doctor’s advice to avoid the sport. But football continued to call Hedges’ name. And pretty soon he couldn’t tune it out. “The doctors told me it was up to me, but if it was up to them, (they wouldn’t play),” Hedges said. “So I didn’t my sophomore year. I listened to them. But then I missed it way too much and I had to come back last year. I’m glad I did.” Biding his time With Evan Sembell in front of Hedges on the depth chart last season, Rochester coach Derek Leonard didn’t need to call on the second-string running back much. Sembell ran for a Central State Eight Conference record 2,447 yards on 368 carries while scoring 33 touchdowns. “I knew (last year) Kenny was going to be the guy this year,” Leonard said. “I probably should’ve used (Hedges) more last year but he had some fumbling trouble. “Because of the type of team we were, I probably didn’t use him as much as I should’ve because he is explosive.” Hedges said he had to adjust to coming back to the game in addition to getting over the trepidation of another back injury. “I think last year, I was still kind of nervous about my back so I was playing scared (hence the fumbles),” Hedges said. “I was kind of focusing on what I was going to do after I caught the ball instead of focusing on catching the ball and holding onto the ball.” Hedges said it took the first three games of the 2014 season to start becoming more comfortable with his back’s stability. Important cog This season, Hedges has rushed for 725 yards on 100 carries and has scored 15 touchdowns as the Rockets have jumped to a 5-0 start. He’s also caught four passes for 70 yards, and Hedges is one of the 13 players with at least one catch for Rochester. Page 2 of 2 - Some running backs admit to being much less comfortable catching balls and prefer the ball to be jammed into their gut and to be just set loose. But Hedges enjoys playing receiver from time to time. “I like catching,” Hedges said. “I like running routes; it’s fun. My hands aren’t fantastic — they’re OK — but I’m completely comfortable with that.” On defense, Hedges has 11 tackles from a safety position. RB lineage The Rockets’ quarterback ancestry is unique for a school of Rochester’s size, with five straight Division I products. But the Rockets’ running back line of succession has been equally impressive. The first Rochester state championship team of 2010 featured Colten Glazebrook, who ran for 1,719 yards on 239 carries with 38 touchdowns. Garret Dooley held the starting RB job for two title seasons — 2011 and 2012 — in which he combined for 401 carries, 2,665 yards and 58 TDs. In 2013, Drake Berberet succeeded Dooley and totaled 1,662 yards, 230 carries and 33 touchdowns. Then last year Sembell broke Kenni Burns’ CS8 rushing record of 2,444 yards for Sacred Heart-Griffin in 2002. “I find it kind of cool how ... Glazebrook was more of a shiftier kind of guy,” said Hedges, who is 5 feet 8 and 163 pounds. “Dooley was a power runner (and) ran people over. (In 2013), Berberet was a shifty kind of guy. The year after that, Sembell was a big guy. “I’ve kind of fallen in place — I’m a shiftier kind of guy. I look to play a lot like Berberet and Glazebrook.” Hedges doesn’t have to put the team on his back, but he — and the back — is capable of it. — Contact Ryan Mahan: ryan.mahan @sj-r.com, 788-1546, twitter.com/RyanMahanSJR .
