(Getty Images) By Jonathan Rand \nThe Royals usually know what to expect out of Edinson Volquez -- a consistent starter in the middle of the rotation who can be counted on to keep them in a game and win more often than he loses. \nThey received much more than that Friday night as Volquez pitched six scoreless innings while giving up just two hits and striking out five as the Royals took the first game of the American League Championship Series, 5-0, over the Blue Jays. \nIt's safe to say that this might have been a pleasant surprise for the K.C. faithful. After all, Volquez entered Game 1 with a postseason record of 0-3 with an 8.76 ERA, hardly the kind of numbers a pitcher would want to take against the league's most dangerous offense. \nBut on Friday night, Volquez seemed to find another gear, averaging 95 miles per hour on his fastball while keeping it down and nailing the corners. \nIt was mostly easy sailing through five. But, in the sixth, the Jays mounted a serious threat when Josh Donaldson and Jose Bautista drew back-to-back walks to open the frame. After 29 minutes, 37 pitches and four full counts, Volquez struck out Troy Tulowitzki to snuff out the scoring chance -- while a raucous sellout crowd at Kauffman Stadium breathed a deep sigh of relief. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \n\"It is very challenging to get through that lineup for the third time,\" Royals Manager Ned Yost said after the game. \"He walked Donaldson and Bautista, he's not going to give in and just throw the ball down the middle because he knows the damage he can do. That was a great inning to cap off a great outing for him.\" \nVolquez, a one-time All-Star pitching for his fourth team in four years, earned the nickname \"Steady Eddie\" during the regular season because he was the lone constant of a rotation constantly in flux. Yordano Ventura, who was expected to emerge as the staff leader, struggled so badly early in the season that he almost earned a stint at Class AAA Omaha, Neb. \nJohnny Cueto, obtained at the Trade Deadline, barely resembled the ace the Royals had anticipated until his masterpiece in the final game of the ALDS against the Astros. Given all that uncertainty, Yost spent much of the season's second half renovating his rotation's back end. Through it all, Volquez was a rock. \nFor most of the season, the Royals' rotation was cited as the most likely obstacle to the their chances of returning to the World Series. And, indeed, that helps explain why Kansas City fell behind in each of its three victories over Houston. \nBut after Cueto's masterful Game 5 ALDS performance and Volquez's gem in Game 1 of the ALCS, that formerly shaky rotation might be solidifying at just the right time. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nFor Game 2 on Saturday afternoon, the Royals will start Ventura -- who came to life late in the season -- against David Price. For Game 3 on Monday in Toronto, the Royals will have Cueto, who retired the last 19 Astros he faced on Wednesday, against Marcus Stroman. \nKansas City signed Volquez in late December to fill a hole left in the rotation when ace and clubhouse leader James Shields left as a free agent. It simply seemed like a sensible pickup, a reliable starter who could benefit from a big park and an exceptional defense. Nothing more, nothing less. \nBut remember that Shields started the ALCS opener a year ago in Baltimore, and was knocked out in the sixth inning as the Royals saw a 5-1 lead evaporate. \n\"Steady Eddie\" didn't let anything like that happen on Friday. Not on his watch. And now, suddenly, the Royals are starting something. \n*** \nJonathan Rand spent 32 years as a sports writer in Miami and Kansas City.
