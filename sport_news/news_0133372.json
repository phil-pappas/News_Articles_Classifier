I don’t think it’s fair to ask the institution to do it. \n“It has to be done with private dollars. And it’s hard to raise private dollars sometimes. But they’re in one of the most competitive – the broadest-based – conference and, to be honest with you, others have had resources they have not had.” Jim Delany: I’ve got plenty of confidence in Rutgers leadership \nThe 11 fully integrated Big Ten members each reportedly received a payment of $32 million for the fiscal year 2014-15. That number is expected to climb to $45 million in 2017-18, the first year of the new Big Ten Network television deal. \nRutgers and Maryland receive only a fractional payout until their six-year integration period is complete in June 2021. Nebraska becomes a full-fledged member in June 2018. \nIs there anything the Big Ten can do to help Rutgers before that point? \n“No, because there’s an academic integration plan, a competitive integration plan, and a financial integration plan,” Delany said. “Basically our goal was to keep our institutions whole relative to where they were, and then at a certain point in time they’ll become a full member of the conference. \n“They’ll have an undivided interest in the Big Ten Network and everything that we do. But that doesn’t happen overnight. So anything that we do would come out of somebody else.” \nRutgers struggled mightily in its first year in the Big Ten , with the 14 programs that maintain head-to-head records winning just 39 percent of conference regular-season games. \nSince Delany isn’t about to play Robin Hood, the Big Ten did not order Rutgers to upgrade facilities. Rutgers pays Kyle Flood $2 million less than Big Ten average \n“I like the plan. I wasn’t involved in the plan. There was no pressure on our part,” Delany said. “We love the institution, we love what the institution stands for. So I think over time that they will improve their facilities, and I think it’ll make them more competitive when they do.’ \nThe plan unveiled in May conspicuously lacked financial details and a timeline, though the Rutgers physical master plan calls for a transformation by 2030. \n“If you think about proportionate amounts over 10 years, 15 years, what we plan for athletics could easily be $200-$300 million,” Barchi said in May. “But that's a lot of buildings and a lot of facilities. Much of that might never get built. I don't know. You are painting a picture of the future. Not tomorrow.” \nIn the short-term, Rutgers is withstanding multiple controversies connected to the football program. The school and outside counsel are investigating to see if any NCAA violations were committed. \nDelany was at Rutgers to be supportive and to meet with appropriate parties. \n“I think everybody in the Big Ten feels for schools when they have problems,” he said. “I call it collegial empathy. There’s nobody that feels good when somebody goes through a difficult time. \n“I notice in my 26 years that when somebody is down, people are there to try to be supportive and helpful. That’s what conference members do for each other. That’s what we did with Penn State. And that’s what we did with a variety of issues that have come up over time. \n“We understand accountability, but we also understand it’s part of our family and we want them to be healthy and whole and we understand what’s in the past and what’s in the future.” \nStaff Writer Ryan Dunleavy: rdunleavy@gannettnj.com 1 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1RAbnYS TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T00:33:35.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
