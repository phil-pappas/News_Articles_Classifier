Buford is looking for its ninth straight state championship, which has spanned three different classifications. \nBuford has shown tremendous flexibility with as many as five pitchers that have seen action in the circle in 2015. Couple that with a lineup that features Baylee Sexton, Samantha Thomas, Breanna Gutierrez, and Drew Puckett and the Lady Wolves are sure to be one of the teams to beat in Class AAAA. \nThe Lady Wolves (22-6) will take on Woodward Academy (5-14) in the first round in a best-of-three series beginning Wednesday with a doubleheader. \nRidgeland, which knocked off Buford 3-2 last month, is the only Class AAAA team in the tournament field to beat the Lady Wolves during the regular season. \nThe Lady Wolves will face a tough second round series if they advance. They would get the winner of Thomas County Central (26-5) and Locust Grove (24-7). \nNorth Hall (20-8) will take on Troup County (12-15) in the first round in a best-of-three series beginning Wednesday with a doubleheader. The Lady Trojans face a rough bracket as well with Heritage, Catoosa (27-4) which owns the most wins in Class AAAA, and Walnut Grove (23-5) in their quadrant. \nIn Class , Flowery Branch (17-13) is the third seed from Region 8- and will travel to Alexander (18-8) the No. 2 seed from Region 5- . \nIn Class AAA, Banks County (16-7) is the highest-seeded team after finishing second in Region 7-AAA. The Lady Leopards will play host to Sonoraville (16-13). \nFor other 7-AAA teams, Fannin County (13-12) the third seed, will travel to Ringgold (22-5) while Dawson County, the fourth seed, has a huge task traveling to Region 6-AAA champ Calhoun (27-3) which leads Class AAA in wins. \nFor Region 8-AAA teams, East Jackson (21-10) heads to Cedartown (22-7) while Jefferson (10-16) travels to Region 5-AAA champ Central, Carroll (19-8). \nIn Class AA, Region 8-AA second-seeded Union County (21-7) will play host to Bowden (12-17) the third seed from Region 5-AA. The Panthers are tied for the fifth-highest win percentage in AA but may face a road trip to Lamar County in the second round. \nRabun County (14-14) is the third seed from Region 8-AA and will travel to Bremen (16-9) out of Region 5-AA. If the Lady Wildcats can get by Bremen they could face a second round matchup against Seminole County (20-5) which is tied for the seventh-most wins in Class AA. \nIn Class , one of the best series in the first round should be North Forsyth (20-7) traveling to Collins Hill (19-7). The Lady Raiders are ninth in wins in and have allowed the 11th fewest runs over the course of the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:36:20.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
