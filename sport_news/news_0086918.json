There were times he couldn’t even believe what was happening -- including during his first conversation with his oncologist, a conversation during which he had to ask his doctor to stop so he could process what he was being told. There were times he spent seven to 10 hours at a time hooked up intravenously in an infusion bed, receiving three or more chemotherapy medications at any one time -- six months’ worth of chemotherapy in an eight-week span, he said, a necessary step to combat an aggressive growth of cancer. It was at those times when John Farrell did what he did every day, even before he received his Aug. 10 diagnosis of non-Hodgkin’s Burkitt’s lymphoma. He headed to the ballpark. “There's a choice you can make to put your tail between your legs and feel sorry for yourself, but it was like, 'You know what? The hell with that,’” he said in a conference call with reporters on Friday, as much energy in his voice as there has ever been. Farrell received word from doctors on Thursday that his cancer is in remission, the first and most significant step toward a full recovery from the cancer only discovered because he underwent hernia surgery. He said he will continue to undergo examinations to check for a recurrence of the cancer every three months for the next year and less frequently as time passes. With a clean bill of health, Farrell is clear to resume duties as manager of the Red Sox -- duties that include a flight to Arizona on Saturday for five days of offseason planning and strategy meetings with the team’s front office. He’s also walking two or three miles per day four or five times a week, he said, and his appetite has returned fully -- though he never vomited or lost weight during his chemotherapy treatments. Farrell is back to full health. “It beat me up a little bit physically,” he said, “but, honestly, right now I’m feeling pretty darn good.” When he announced his diagnosis on Aug. 14, Farrell took an immediate leave of absence from his post as Red Sox manager, ceding the reins to bench coach and longtime friend Torey Lovullo. But that didn’t mean he was ever far from the team. He said Friday that he watched every remaining road game on TV and spent the first six or seven innings of every home game at Fenway Park before returning home to watch the rest of the game. He spoke with Red Sox principal owner John Henry during visits to his office; he spoke with then-Red Sox president Larry Lucchino when Lucchino, a fellow cancer survivor, visited him in the hospital. He was in consistent communication with Lovullo and team president Dave Dombrowski about the direction of the team. Page 2 of 2 - Farrell watched with appreciation as young stars like Mookie Betts, Xander Bogaerts and Blake Swihart continued to shine and others like Jackie Bradley Jr. and Rusney Castillo showed at least flashes of dynamic ability. He will once again manage those players starting next spring. “There was a sense of energy that you felt even watching on TV,” he said. All the while, Farrell went through his chemotherapy treatments -- buoyed both by the second-half surge of his Red Sox team and the support of “literally thousands” of people who reached out to him. Farrell has spoken with Minnesota Timberwolves president and head coach Flip Saunders, who himself was fighting lymphoma. He either spoke or exchanged text messages with ex-Red Sox manager Terry Francona every day -- “every single day,” he emphasized. He heard from fans of the rival New York Yankees offering their best wishes. He heard from a fan who had been inspired by his announcement to have his own persistent groin pain examined by a doctor and was diagnosed with Burkitt’s lymphoma. For a man who, like most baseball managers, devoted almost every waking hour to his job, it put life back in perspective. \"You go from almost 100 miles per hour down to a screeching halt,” he said. “Really, what it causes you to do is kind of slow down and take a personal inventory, see what is important around you. This has in many ways been a life-changing event. There’s no doubt about it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T22:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:12:52.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
