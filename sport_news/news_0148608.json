The NL wild-card game then follows Wednesday night. Both games are scheduled to begin at 8 p.m. ET.\nThe division series round of the postseason will begin later this week. On Monday, MLB announced the start times for all division series games through Sunday.\nHere's the schedule (all times Eastern):\nTHURSDAY \nALDS Game 1: Rangers at Blue Jays (4 p.m.)\nALDS Game 1: Astros at Royals (7:30 p.m.) or Yankees at Royals (8 p.m.)\nFRIDAY \nALDS Game 2: Rangers at Blue Jays (12:45 p.m.)\nALDS Game 2: Astros or Yankees at Royals (3:45 p.m.)\nNLDS Game 1: Cubs or Pirates at Cardinals (12:45 p.m.)\nNLDS Game 1: Mets at Dodgers (9:45 p.m.)\nSATURDAY \nNLDS Game 1: Cubs or Pirates at Cardinals (5:30 p.m.)\nNLDS Game 2: Mets at Dodgers (9 p.m.)\nSUNDAY \nALDS Game 3: Royals at Astros or Yankees (4 p.m.)\nALDS Game 3: Blue Jays at Rangers (8 p.m.)\nNice and straightforward. The start of the ALDS will be pushed back a half-hour if the Yankees beat the Astros in Tuesday's wild-card game, but the start time for every other game through Sunday is set. The Cardinals, owners of MLB's best record, open their postseason with an afternoon game.
