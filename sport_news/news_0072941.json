Against Louisville on Saturday, he amassed 170 yards receiving — another first in his career that has blossomed this season. \n“Anybody can be a kick returner if he’s fast and has good blocking,” said Whitfield, most known for his 100-yard kickoff return during FSU’s national title win over Auburn in 2013. “But as far as evolving myself to a receiver, over the summer I just practiced better on my routes and playing fast without the ball in my hands.” \nAnd the hard work is paying dividends for the No. 9 Seminoles (6-0, 4-0 Atlantic Coast Conference), who will travel to Atlanta for a rematch of last season's conference title game against Georgia Tech (2-5, 0-4) at 7 p.m. Saturday on ESPN2. Clark: A storybook moment for former FSU walk-on Javien Elliott \nComing into the season, Whitfield had only 16 catches for 234 yards and no touchdowns as a freshman and sophomore. \nHe also missed a bulk of spring practice with hamstring injury, and looked to be headed down the depth chart behind junior Bobo Wilson, sophomores Travis Rudolph, Ja’Vonn Harrison, Ermon Lane, and incoming freshmen George Campbell, Da’Vante Phillips, Auden Tate and Nyqwan Murray. \nInstead, he is FSU’s best receiver through the first six games. \nWhitfield leads the team with 29 receptions and 397 yards and has two touchdowns, including a 70-yard catch and run from a scrambling Everett Golson against the Cardinals on Saturday. 5 things we learned from FSU’s win over Louisville \n“We’re finding different way to get him the ball,” Fisher said of Whitfield. “He is a very dynamic guy and he’s really learning to be a football player. He still has a long ways to go, but he’s really learning how to play football.” \nAdded Whitfield: “I see it coming. I just waited on my moment by practicing every day, rehabbing, getting better and doing everything they want me to do.” \nWhitfield, Rudolph and Wilson have all benefited from being FSU’s primary receivers as Golson has continued to grow more comfortable in Jimbo Fisher’s offense. Each player has more than 20 receptions. Wilson also has two touchdowns while Rudolph has three this season. \nA more mature mindset and the competition at the loaded position group has kept Whitfield on his toes. And he’s been determined to improve with each practice. Jimbo Fisher: 6-0 Seminoles 'selling themselves short' after win against Louisville \nFisher said Whitfield is running corner and routes more precisely, blocking better downfield and is playing with more confidence now that he has a greater grasp of the playbook. \nFisher also said Whitfield is the fastest player on the field, even when running back Dalvin Cook is in the game. \n“When you get speed like that, now, it changes things,” Fisher said earlier this week. “I can coach a lot of things. I can't coach that.” FSU vs Louisville Fan Cam \nWhitfield feels like “there’s nobody that can catch me.” But he’s more focused on being the best he can be. \n“I’m never satisfied because there’s always room for improvement,” Whitfield said. “I just want to get better every week, every day.” 162 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.tdo.com/1RQ3L4T TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:26:50.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
