But others can’t shake the sour taste left from their season-opening loss in Dallas, where the Giants basically gave away a game they should have won.\nSix weeks later, the two NFC East rivals meet at MetLife Stadium with some Giants using the 27-26 loss at AT&T Stadium as motivation for revenge.\n“We’re excited to play these guys again,” Giants guard Justin Pugh said. “The way the last game went with them makes this definitely a game I’ve been looking forward to.”\nFor those who need their memory refreshed: The Giants had a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter and were leading 23-20 when they appeared headed for a clinching touchdown with the ball at the Cowboys 1 with 1:43 remaining. Dallas had no timeouts. Poor execution and poor time management cost them a victory.\nInstead of running the ball or taking a sack on third down to burn the most time, quarterback Eli Manning threw an incomplete pass to stop the clock with 1:37 remaining. Instead of going for it on fourth down and either scoring or forcing the Cowboys to go 99 yards, the Giants kicked a field goal to make it 26-2o.\nFollowing a good kickoff return, the Cowboys got the ball at their own 28 with 1:38 remaining. It took 91 seconds for Tony Romo to carve up the Giants secondary and march the Cowboys 72 yards in six plays for a touchdown pass to tight end Jason Witten to win the game.\nGreg Hardy wreaked havoc against the Patriots in his return to the field in Week 5.

The loss should still feel like a pit in their stomachs. It was that bad.\n“I’ve had this circled since the first game of the season,” Pugh added.\nOther players insisted the first game has no relevance other than it contributed to a 3-3 record and the beginning of several head-scratching late-game decisions made by Manning. But if the result of the last game isn’t a source of motivation, perhaps the Cowboys’ five consecutive victories against the Giants should be.\n“They won the last game, and this is definitely a must-win for us,” wide receiver Odell Beckham said. “We just have to step up and make plays and execute in all phases better than we have been.”\nThe Cowboys are a different team than they were in the season opener. Romo is out with a shoulder injury, and Matt Cassel will start at quarterback after Brandon Weeden failed to produce a win in three starts. The Dallas defense also has been strengthened by the addition of defensive end Greg Hardy and linebacker Rolando McClain, who were both activated from suspension two weeks ago.\nThe revamped Cowboys defense posted a season-high five sacks, two by Hardy, in a 30-6 loss to the Patriots before last week’s bye.\n“He makes a difference on the field, and we’re going to have to account for him,” running back Rashad Jennings said of Hardy. “And McClain is another physical guy in the middle of the field that we’re going to have to account for.”\nThe Cowboys have lost three straight, but they’re 18-8 coming off a bye and have won seven straight NFC East road games, one short of a franchise record. The Giants are hoping to end that streak and gain some revenge in the process.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under dallas cowboys ,  eli manning ,  new york giants", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:12:12.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
