Sources said a youth named Deepak had also died of dengue recently. While the PGIMS officials said both Deepak and Ashok were dengue patients, the district health authorities maintain that whether the deceased were suffering from dengue is subject to confirmation. Though the latest official figures of dengue cases could not be accessed in view of a holiday today, the sources maintain that at least 1,700 confirmed cases of dengue have been reported at the PGIMS so far. Of these, nearly 1,000 cases are said to be from Rohtak district. Rohtak Deputy Civil Surgeon Dr Vedpal claimed the report of the dengue confirmatory test of Deepak was found to be negative, while that of Ashok was yet to be verified. On the other hand, PGIMS officials have affirmed that both were suffering from dengue. Meanwhile, patients suspected to be suffering from dengue, malaria and viral fever continued to throng the PGIMS. As the OPDs were closed today, the emergency wing of the institute witnessed a heavy rush. Sources maintain that a large number of patients visit the PGIMS for tests and treatment, as these facilities are provided free of cost at the institute. While the local Civil Hospital does not have adequate facilities, the private medical practitioners charge heavily for tests and treatment. A special ward has been created at the PGIMS for fever patients in order to ensure proper care and treatment. A number of patients suffering from dengue and related disorders are also undergoing treatment in the other indoor wards of the institute. Fatehabad: A seven-year-old girl from Tohana reportedly died of dengue at a private hospital in Hisar on Thursday night. The victim, Simran, was a daughter of a schoolteacher. She developed fever some days ago and was admitted to the private hospital in Tohana. She was shifted to a Hisar hospital yesterday after her blood pressure dropped and condition deteriorated. The victim’s family said doctors had confirmed that Simran was suffering from dengue. However, both Deputy Civil Surgeon Dr Manish Bansal and Senior Medical Officer of the Tohana General Hospital Dr Satish Garg maintained that they had not received any communication from the Hisar hospital with regard to Simran's tests. Her body was brought to Tohana today. “The girl developed fever only a few days ago and her platelets count was also more than 1 lakh when she was at Tohana. It seems unlikely that she had died of dengue,” said Garg. Bansal said he would be able to comment only after receiving any communication from the Hisar hospital. In Fatehabad, 38 persons have tested positive for dengue so far, said Bansal. — Sushil Manav", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:27:13.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
