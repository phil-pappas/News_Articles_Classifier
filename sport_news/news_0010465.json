(AP Photo/Gary Hershorn) \nThe Washington Redskins and Tampa Bay Buccaneers meet today for the 22nd time in the history of these two franchises. \nThe Buccaneers own a 10-9 record against the Redskins in regular season play, and the teams split their two postseason matchups. \nTampa Bay won the last meeting – Nov. 16, 2014 – by a score of 27-7 at FedEx Field. \nThe Redskins will celebrate their annual “alumni homecoming weekend,” and will wear their throwback uniforms, which represent a look similar to the threads the team sported back in 1932. They’ll have a darker burgundy jersey, and pants that are actually gold in color. The one main difference will be the helmets, which are the normal helmets, but with the stripes down the middle removed. Back in 2012, the team wore helmets designed to look like leather, but the league has since ruled that teams can’t wear alternate helmets for safety reasons. So, these will be the burgundy helmets with the usual logo of the Native American on each side. \nAt halftime, the team will induct former center Jeff Bostic, a member of the famed Hogs, into the Ring of Honor. \nIn case you missed them, here are the key matchups and top five story lines of this game . Now, here are some other things to keep an eye out for today. Washington seeks its third consecutive Week 7 matchup today, and will try to snap a two-game losing streak and get its first win since beating the Eagles on Oct. 4. A win today would give the Redskins their third straight home victory, which would represent a first since a four-game win streak at FedEx Field in 2012. With a win today, Washington would beat its first NFC South opponent since Sept. 30, 2012, when they beat the Bucs. A victory today would improve the Redskins’ all-time record to 5-1 against teams coached by Lovie Smith. The Redskins face the team that held the No. 1 pick in the most recent draft for the sixth time in the last seven seasons. Washington’s defense aims to record at least three takeaways in a third consecutive game for the first time since doing so in Weeks 9-12 of the 2003 season. The Redskins aim to finish with a positive turnover margin in four straight games for the first time since Weeks 14-17 of the 2012 season. Washington’s defense will try to hold an opponent scoreless on its opening drive for the seventh straight week. Cornerback Bashaud Breeland enters this game with an interception in back-to-back games. His two interceptions tied a career high. He will try to extend his streak to three games. If so, Breeland would become the first Redskins player to record an interception in three straight weeks since London Fletcher did so in Weeks 14-16 of the 2012 season. Quarterback Kirk Cousins needs 30 pass completions today to become the first Redskins quarterback since 1960 to post three 30-completion games in a single season. He currently is tied with Sonny Jurgensen (1967), Jason Campbell (2007) and Robert Griffin III (2013) with two. Cousins has thrown a touchdown in six straight games, which represents a career-best mark. Wide receiver Pierre Garcon needs 94 receiving yards to pass Roy Jefferson (1971-76) for 12th on the franchise’s all-time receiving list. Garcon currently has 3,026 receiving yards since signing with Washington in 2012. Kicker Dustin Hopkins has a chance to become the first kicker in team history to make a 50-yard field goal in three straight games. Linebacker Ryan Kerrigan needs a sack to break his tie with Ken Harvey (1994-99) for fourth place on the team’s sacks list. They each currently have 41.5 sacks to their names. \nSome connections between these teams: Tampa Bay tight end coach Jon Embree held the same position with the Redskins in 2010.
