Then, after putting his approach shot on the par-5 18th into a hazard, he took his penalty stroke and chipped in for birdie.\nIt was a flamboyant finish to a second straight 2-under-par 69 that gave Fox a whopping 12-shot victory and a berth on the nine-player section's state team.\n\"I don't know how it happened,\" Fox said of his chip-in that gave him a 36-hole score of 4-under 138. \"My short game has been really good this year. It has helped me drop a lot of strokes.\nThe CBA tandem of Jack O'Hara and Kyle Adams came in second and third with scores of 150 and 151, respectively.\n\"The kid's incredible,\" said Adams, a senior who qualified for states for the first time. \"The kid just doesn't miss a putt.\"\nO'Hara added, \"I like playing with kids that play better and try to copy what they're doing and try to stay with them. It helps me play a lot better. It was great playing with him. He's so good.\"\nThe 12-stroke margin is believed to be the largest in the history of the qualifier — not bad for someone who didn't even make the 43-player field for last year's state qualifier opening round.\n\"My goal was just to get on the state team,\" Fox said, \"but to win this tournament is a bonus.\"\nHis older brother Victor, now a junior on the Maryland golf team, won this event twice, but his largest margin was seven.\nIt was evident early on that no one would challenge the younger Fox, who began the round two shots ahead of Shenendehowa's Tommy McPartlon. Fox birdied the first, and it was game on.\nAfter finishing the front nine at even par to push his lead to five, Fox birdied three of the final five holes while his challengers struggled.\n\"It's never in the bag until it's over,\" Fox said. \"I played as hard as I can and do the best I can.\"\nThe course played much more difficult than for the opening round. Only three players — Christian Gramuglia (Burnt Hills), Sean Puleo ( Albany Academy ) and Noah Bonn (Queensbury) — bettered their Tuesday score, and all made the state team. Puleo and McPartlon are the lone repeaters.\n\"It was a lot longer, the pins were unreal, it was windy,\" said O'Hara, who followed his opening 73 with a 77. \"It was really hard today.\"\nO'Hara and Adams played in the final group together Thursday as CBA was one of two schools to advance two players. Albany Academy, with Puleo and John Malicki , was the other.\n\"I choked last year, so I was a little nervous on the first tee this morning,\" Adams said. \"I shot 79 last year then shot 84. I got to 16 last year and I shanked my iron. I said don't do that again. I hit it on the green — and three-putted that hole.\"\nBy that point, Adams had plenty of cushion to make the state team. He just wasn't going to catch Fox.
