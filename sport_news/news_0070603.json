The Raiders held 16-12 and 23-22 leads in the fourth set but saw each slip due to an assortment of unforced — and uncharacteristic — errors. \n“Those little mistakes are big mistakes when you're playing a good team,” Brown said. \nKaylee Maddox shared her coach's assessment. \n“It was just the small things we don't usually mess up on,” said this year's Cullman County MVP. “It just kinda got us in the end.” \nMaddox never displayed an ounce of quit, racking up 27 kills, four blocks, three aces and five assists. \nThe tears flowed freely for the senior following her final match — but it wasn't out of weakness. It had more to do with saying goodbye to a program that's produced enough memories and friendships to last a lifetime. \n“It means a lot,” Maddox said of her Good Hope career. “Especially just all the girls I've got to play with in the past and especially this year. This year was the best I've had.” \nKate Kent kicked in 14 kills and seven blocks against Danville. Alyssa Harlan added seven kills and five blocks, and Hannah Smith had 29 assists, three kills and a block. Angel Baker chipped in six assists. \nHarlan, Smith and Baker rounded out the Raiders' senior class. Maddox, Harlan and Smith were varsity mainstays since their freshman seasons. \nMaddox and Smith will continue their volleyball journeys at the college level, the former at Wallace State and latter at Snead State. \n“They've been around a long time,” Brown said of her seniors. “Good kids. The best.” \nMaddox reciprocated the love for her coach. She said Brown has meant “everything” to Good Hope volleyball. \n“I feel like she's made it what it is right now,” Maddox said. \nBrown held her composure for as long as possible but finally cracked shortly after addressing her girls and sauntering away to add up one last batch of stats. \nBrown fought through tears while speaking about how representing the Red and White has “been a big part of my life.” \nAlthough she's done roaming the Good Hope bench, dancing and reacting with every point, Brown will, without a doubt, forever be a Raider. \n“Always.” \n% Rob Ketcham can be reached at 256-734-2131, ext. 138 or at robk@cullmantimes.com.​ Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:57:54.553+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
