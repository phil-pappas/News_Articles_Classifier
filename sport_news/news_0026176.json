Earlier, the facility was available only in cases where the cost was up to Rs 20 lakh.\nFor properties above Rs 30 lakh and up to Rs 75 lakh, the LTV will be up to 80% and those above Rs 75 lakh, it will be 75%.\nA slew of banks, including State Bank of India, PNB, IDBI Bank and Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, have lowered their base rates after RBI on September 29 reduced its repo rate by a hefty 50 bps to 6.75%.\nRBI has lowered risk weights on housing loans of up to Rs 75 lakh from 50% to 35% in cases where the borrower puts in at least- 20% of the value of the home as own equity for loans up to Rs 30 lakh; and, 25% of the value of the home as own equity for loans between Rs 30 lakh and Rs 75 lakh.\nThe report said, theoretically, lower risk weights should significantly boost the return on equity (RoE) of the mortgage portfolio of banks.\n\"However, with competition in home loans continuously intensifying and the interest-rate cycle turning south, we believe this is unlikely, and banks will have to pass on the benefit to borrowers. Therefore, any boost to RoE would be marginal.\"\nAccording to the report, around 80% of home loan borrowers and 70% of home loans (by value) would meet the criteria for lower risk weights set by the RBI and thereby benefit from the change in regulation.\nHome loan borrowers in smaller cities are likely to be the biggest gainers from the RBI move due to limited supply at affordable price points in the larger cities, it said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:11:34.714+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
