Hy-Vee rolled out Aisles Online in September after finding success in Des Moines. An online form allows customers to either set up a delivery or arrange a pick up time at the store. \nWorking much like the baggage system at an airport, everything is tracked electronically. \n\"It's going really well. A lot of great comments only going to continue to go well,\" Store Director Deb Riedel said. \nAfter a couple weeks of test runs, Riedel says demand is quickly growing.\"Our customers love it. We have return orders coming through so they've used it before and they want to come back and do it again,\" Riedel said. \nThe new delivery service costs around $5 for delivery or $3 for pick up. \nThe service is free for any order over $100.
