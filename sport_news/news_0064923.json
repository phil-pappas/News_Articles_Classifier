It has pointed out that smuggling of fake Indian currency notes is also linked to cattle smuggling.\n\"Smuggling of cattle has shown a phenomenal increase this year. It is, therefore, imperative that measures like shifting of cattle haats, customs impound centre on the international border and having a system of ascertaining credentials of auctioneers and purchasers be implemented immediately,\" Hazarika has suggested in the report.\nHe has also added that, instead of allowing auction of cattle close to the border, it should be shifted to around 50 km away from the border. He explained that doing this will automatically increase the cost of transportation for the smugglers and hence act as an effective deterrent.\nThe report has also suggested an amendment in the existing laws for prohibiting interstate movement of cattle.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-25T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:46:13.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
