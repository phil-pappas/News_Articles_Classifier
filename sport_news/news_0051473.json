We now know Russell will miss the remainder of the season following neck surgery. The typical recovery period for such an injury is six months, according to Baylor.\nThe only things at stake are the Big 12 title, a playoff push and possibly an invitation to New York.\nBest case scenario: Freshman Jarrett Stidham is the latest plug-and-play quarterback to lead the Bears.\nThe worst: The system fails. Baylor loses a game because an inexperienced freshman is taking over at quarterback.\nThe “system quarterback” term is divisive. Just check Twitter when I suggested Stidham just might be the next man up because the system suits him. The 6-foot-3, 210-pounder has been on campus since January, coming from Stephenville (Texas) High where was a three-time all-stater.\nThe system connotation is that the scheme is bigger than the talent. That fails to recognize the fact that Art Briles might be the best developer of quarterbacks in the nation. And that Stidham might be the highest rated quarterback he has landed.\n“We certainly have a bunch of confidence in Jarrett,” Briles said Monday. “He's a guy that's instinctively ready and athletically ready to play.”\nRussell heads to the sidelines leading the country in yards per pass (10.5) and pass efficiency (189.7). He's tied for most touchdown passes (29).\nAll of it suggests it might be OK to be in a system that has developed a Heisman winner (Robert Griffin III) and won consecutive Big 12 titles, all since 2011. The system is on pace for Baylor to shatter the NCAA record for touchdowns in a season (99, Oklahoma in 2008).\n“Who knows?” Briles said when asked about the hot-button nature of the word “system.” “I guess the [Indiana] Pacers probably have their system. That could be said honestly about any university or about any offense. Everybody's got what they do and what they believe in.”\nKansas coach David Beaty is about as informed a source as there is on Texas schoolboy football. The former Texas A&M receivers coach was part of a staff that was recruiting Stidham last year.\n“This kid from a fundamentals standpoint and mechanics standpoint, he's as good as I've seen,” said Beaty who spent nine years as a Texas high school coach.\n“The guy makes great decisions. Baylor is in really good hands, man.”\nBeaty got a look at Stidham's most extensive action this season. In relief of Russell, Stidham completed nine of 10 for 117 yards and two touchdowns in the second half of a 66-7 blowout on Oct. 10.\nI texted one informed observer Sunday to get his take on Stidham taking over. That person suggested the freshman might be more talented than Russell. That, of course, doesn't account for Stidham's inexperience.\nThe person described Baylor's scheme as simple – spread the receivers out, throw hitches, screens or deep. If the defense moves out to the perimeter, start running the ball.\nThat's a typical description for a high-functioning spread offense. Corey Coleman has become a record-breaking receiver. Shock Linwood is sixth nationally in rushing and has five 100-yard games.\n“We went fast but we didn't go as fast as they go, nobody does,” said Greg Winder, Stidham's coach at Stephenville.\n“Coach Briles and Kendal [Briles, offensive coordinator], make it pretty simple for those guys. He's got all that speed on the outside. Jarret's got that great arm.”\nThis type of thing has happened before, perhaps most famously in 1985 at Oklahoma. Troy Aikman broke his leg early on and eventually transferred to UCLA. Freshman Jamelle Holieway took over leading the Sooners to a national championship.\nStidham is in position to do the same. The four-star prospect arrived in January, completely immersing himself in the program.\n“If it's his job for a while, he'll take it and run with it,” Winder said. “In high school, he was typical high school kid. Little bit more mature. He's always had a good head on his shoulders.”\nYeah, but how does that head stay on a swivel during his first start in 10 days on Thursday night at Kansas State?\nMike Kuchar runs a website that sells schematic information to coaches. He said Baylor's offense puts a “ton” of responsibility on the quarterback.\n“But,” Kuchar wrote in an email, “it's what Baylor does best. I'm sure Briles, knowing the coach he is, has repped that kid tremendously in practice but it doesn't simulate a game situation. So, I'd be curious to see how he responds under that pressure of being a top-five team.”\nThis situation isn't quite the same as third-stringer Cardale Jones taking over for Ohio State in the Big Ten title game. But it's close. We're talking the No. 2 team in the nation going into the heart of its schedule with a freshman quarterback.\nIt was a back injury to Bryce Petty last year that allowed Russell to start a game last season, essentially getting his feet wet in the “system”. In that game (against Northwestern State), Russell threw for 438 yards. In eight games last year, Russell did what you'd expect of a Briles quarterback – averaging 9.5 yards per throw, eight touchdowns, one interception.\nNow here comes Stidham with five regular-season games remaining.\n“He's as talented a thrower as you'll be around,” said Texas Tech's Kliff Kingsbury. The Red Raiders coach lost a heated recruiting battle with Baylor. Stidham switched from Tech to the Bears at the last minute.\n“There' always a learning curve but Art Briles is one of the best quarterback gurus in the history of college football.”\nWith one of the best systems.\n\nSeth Russell will miss the rest of the 2015 season.
