The bad publicity from an outbreak of oyster-related illness could devastate New Jersey's $800 million shellfish industry.\nThe state senate passed a bill last week that would give the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection another year to issue regulations for experimental oyster plots. It also would require the permit holders to certify that the shellfish beds are not visible or easily accessible to the public.\nDEP spokesman Bob Considine said the department plans in the next few months to confer with both sides in the issue before issuing new regulations, which could be ready in early 2016.\n\"Our goal is to provide clearer standards for the shellfish industry to keep it vibrant, while also ensuring health and safety are protected,\" he said.\nAt a state senate hearing in May, the Garden State Seafood Association said having someone get sick from eating a tainted oyster \"would have a real impact on the seafood industry.\"\nThe oysters included in the research programs are solely for the purpose of improving water quality. Unlike oysters grown commercially in non-polluted parts of the New Jersey coast, they cannot be sold or eaten.\nDebbie Mans, head of the NY/NY Baykeeper environmental group, said she has seen a proposed draft of the new regulations, which her group cannot support.\n\"It is very, very restrictive, including a requirement that the permittee have the power to arrest people they think are messing around with the reef,\" she said.\nEnvironmentalists and scientists began planting oyster colonies in polluted areas including Raritan Bay in the early 2000s, hoping to re-establish a species that was once so plentiful that maritime charts listed piles of oysters as threats to navigation.\nBut the research hit a major roadblock in 2010, when the DEP made Baykeeper group rip out its oyster colonies from the bay in Keyport. The state says it acted because it couldn't guarantee that poachers would not steal the oysters, potentially introducing tainted seafood into New Jersey's highly regarded shellfish industry.\nIn the interim, groups including Baykeeper and Rutgers University got permission to set up oyster colonies at the Earle Naval Weapons Station in Middletown, whose pier juts out into the Raritan Bay. Preliminary results showed that the oysters were able to grow and thrive in the contaminated waters of the bay until Superstorm Sandy wrecked them in October 2012. The state allowed that research because the oysters were protected by gun-toting sailors, and boaters are prohibited from getting near the pier.\nResearchers now want to expand the oyster colonies to other parts of the bay and to other waterways in the state to see once and for all if the shellfish can improve water quality.\n___\nWayne Parry can be reached at http://twitter.com/WayneParryAC\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/WayneParryAC"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:51:18.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
