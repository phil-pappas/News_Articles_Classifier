Most assumed Strong gets at least three years for his rebuilding project but last week’s 50-7 loss to TCU is raising questions about his future. Plus, he promised last year a five-loss season “would never happen again.” Oklahoma is now looking like it could challenge for the Big 12 title. \nKEY MATCHUP \nOklahoma QB Baker Mayfield against Texas’ beleaguered secondary. Mayfield has accounted for 17 touchdowns passing and running and he’s the Sooners’ second-leading rusher. The Longhorns gave up five touchdown passes last week and 16 on the season so far. Only two teams in the country have allowed more. \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nOklahoma: LB Eric Striker. He had 12 tackles with two sacks and a forced fumble last week against West Virginia. Striker’s job will be to harass and disrupt Texas freshman quarterback Jerrod Heard, who struggled the last two weeks. \nTexas: DT Hassan Ridgeway. The Longhorns need him to clog collapse the pocket around Mayfield and be strong in run defense to slow down Samaje Perine. That’s a big job, but Ridgeway, whose 6-foot-3, 315-pound frame earned him the nickname “Green Mile,” is the top player on a struggling Longhorns defense and will have to make plays for Texas. \nFACTS & FIGURES \nAfter setting a school record of 527 total yards against Cal, Heard has just 228 the last two games … Perine topped 2,000 career rushing yards last week, getting there faster than former Sooners Adrian Peterson and DeMarco Murray … As if Texas’ season wasn’t bad enough, the school says its longhorn steer mascot Bevo has a “life-threatening condition” and won’t be at the game.
