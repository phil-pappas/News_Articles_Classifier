Fajayan scored on a 17-yard run with less than a minute left in the first half to snap a 7-all tie and send the Carson Senators on their way to a 17-14 victory at the Jim Frank Track & Field Complex Friday night. The play was huge because Carson never trailed the rest of the game en route to its fifth straight victory since an opening day loss to Reed. A Joe Nelson scramble put the ball at the Damonte 27. After a short gain by Abel Carter, Fajayan ripped off a nice 8-yard gain down to the 17. On the next play, Fajayan took a handoff from Nelson and started toward the right sideline. He appeared to be stood up, and then all of a sudden he broke loose and stormed into the end zone. “It was all the line,” Fajayan said. “If they hadn’t made the blocks, the hole wouldn’t have been there. “It was our power play to the short side. I actually thought I was stopped, but I kept my legs going. Normally that play should get 3-4 yards.” Coach Blair Roman credited his senior running back for giving the extra effort and refusing to go down. “The line gave him five yards and he did the rest,” Roman said. “The second effort was outstanding.” Fajayan has been a key player in the deep Carson backfield this year. His ability to play fullback and wingback has been critical. He has backed up Vic Castro and Abel Carter at fullback and subbed in for Greg Wallace and Asa Carter on the wing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T11:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T11:12:08.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
