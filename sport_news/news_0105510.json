The students wanted the varsity authorities to get relevant approvals from the Central Council of Indian Medicine before conducting counseling for the new session. The counseling process witnessed several disruptions before normalcy was restored around 3:30 pm. The students staged a sit-in outside the counseling hall and did not let anyone go in or come out. Later, a meeting was fixed between Vice Chancellor Om Prakash Upadhyay and the protesting students to resolve the issue. The VC informed the students that he had made three visits to Delhi in the last 17 days to get the necessary approvals. â€” OC", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:24:58.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
