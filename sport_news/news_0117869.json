Rose made four birdies on the back nine in a bogey-free round at the Fanling Course and was tied with Taiwanese player Pan Cheng-tseung and Jeev Milka Singh of India. \n\"I was happy with my putting although I did miss a couple (of birdies) which slid by,\" Rose said. \"Yet it is a good start to the tournament.\" \nGraeme McDowell was in a group of six players another shot back at the joint European Tour and Asian Tour event. \nIan Poulter showed no effects of his late arrival to Hong Kong, shooting a composed 67. Poulter landed late Wednesday night after a 15-hour flight from Florida after making last-minute plans to play in the tournament. Poulter's ranking dipped nine places to 51 at the start of the week, making him ineligible to play in the WGC-HSBC Champions and leaving him one short of the minimum number of 13 European Tour events to retain his membership for next season. \nThe Englishman was then handed a spot in Hong Kong by American Rich Beem, who had a sponsors' invite to the tournament but agreed to step aside for Poulter. \n\"I'm fairly happy with that result today although I think I left a few out there. This course suits my game,\" Poulter said. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:06:09.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
