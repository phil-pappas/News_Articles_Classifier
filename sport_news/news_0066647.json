But the NBA preseason game lost the little allure it held as injuries sidelined the Knicks’ Kristaps Porzingis as well as Sixers’ big men Jahlil Okafor and Nerlens Noel.\nWhile Porzingis and the Knicks downplayed the severity of the strained left quad that sidelined him, it still was troubling that this marked the third time the slender 7-foot-3 rookie has been shut down since he worked out for the Knicks prior to the draft.\nThey didn’t miss him Monday night as they improved to 3-0 in the preseason with a 94-88 win.\nPrior to the draft it was a similar injury: a strained left quad that radiated pain to his hip. Also, he was forced to sit out in training camp with a left IT Band strain (running between his hip and knee). Now, with three injuries in a brief span, it is a troubling pattern.\n\"For sure, it’s avoidable, probably,\" Porzingis said. \"We did MRIs and everything. They looked at all the muscles and everything to find how we can prevent this. You can’t obviously avoid it 100 percent. But at least prepare myself, my body, to be in the best shape possible to not have any small issues like this.\"\nPorzingis said he felt a pinch in his leg during Sunday’s practice session and shut down immediately, and that he alerted team doctors. He went for an MRI, which revealed a mild strain. He said that the pre-draft injury forced him to shut down for about 10 days, and he is hopeful that this one doesn’t sideline him for that long.\n\"Whatever they tell me,\" Porzingis said. \"I don’t know what they do to me, but they do all the treatments. Just not do any sports, no activities, no running or nothing; just let the muscle recover and rest.\"\nPorzingis said he didn’t believe that the injuries were related, even though all affected his left leg. But Knicks coach Derek Fisher didn’t rule it out.\n\"It’s possible,\" he said. \"I know I joked a lot with you guys last year about the medical questions and trying to pretend that I can describe any connectedness to certain injuries. But there’s definitely something that we need to try and figure out: how we can make sure to try and help him limit the injuries.\n\"We’re not concerned as much as we were the last time he had the injury with the quad.… But we’re pretty hopeful we’ll have him back Friday.\"\nOkafor, who was drafted No. 3 overall — one spot ahead of Porzingis — sat with a sore right knee. Noel missed a second straight game with lower back and left knee contusions. Joel Embiid, last year’s top pick by the Sixers, was at the game with his right foot in a cast.\n\"I played against [Okafor] in the summer league,\" Porzingis said. \"It was a great experience to compare myself to the other guys that got drafted now. Everybody’s a professional now. The preseason, regular season will start and everybody is a great player. So this is not summer league. … All the draftees will play now, too. So now is you really see who can compete and who can’t play.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:30:29.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
