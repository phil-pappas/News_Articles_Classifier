The Mets took a 2-1 lead into Game 4 Tuesday night. \nThe Cubs last reached the NLCS in 2003, when they lost in seven games to the Marlins. Chicago dropped those final two at home, including the infamous Bartman defeat in Game 6. \nWrigley Field hosted its first Cubs game in 1916, eight years after they last won the World Series. \nCopyright © The Associated Press.
