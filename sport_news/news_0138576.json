Lewiston had earned an automatic bid to the state event by virtue of winning the league title. \nThe stroke totals are for the team's top four golfers, who played 18 holes. \nSkowhegan (359), Cony of Augusta (364), Bangor (373), Edward Little of Auburn (373), Brewer (378), Hampden Academy (390), Nokomis of Newport (403), Oxford Hills of South Paris (412), Lawrence of Fairfield (558) and Mount Blue of Farmington (no score) failed to qualify in that class. \nFour Class B teams qualified for the state championships — Maine Central Institute of Pittsfield (329), Gardiner (346), Erskine Academy of South China (347) and Mount View of Thorndike (351). The Mustangs had earned an automatic bid to the state event by virtue of winning the league title. \nLincoln Academy of Newcastle (349), Waterville (357), Maranacook of Readfield (371), Oceanside of Rockland/Thomaston (398) and Spruce Mountain of Jay (432) failed to qualify. \nInterestingly enough, the four Class B teams that qualified — the Huskies, Tigers, Eagles and Mustangs — were the four teams that participated in the league Class B shootout on Monday, Oct. 5 at the Rockland Golf Club. \nMount View won that event, which earned them an automatic bid to the state team championships. \nLewiston also won the KVAC Class A shootout, though its score Tuesday would have qualified it as well. \nIn Class A, 17 student-athletes qualified for the state individual championships, including Camden Hills' Julian Starbird, who was the co-medalist, shooting a 77 along with Mount Ararat's Cameron Cox. \nWindjammer freshman Cole Anderson tied for fifth on the day with 82 and also qualified. \nIt is the fourth straight year Starbird qualified for the individual championship, though it is his first foray in Class A. Camden Hills played in Class B for years prior to this season, including winning back-to-back state Class B crowns in 2013 and 2014. \nIn Class B, 12 student-athletes qualified, including Oceanside's Nick Mazurek (73, second), Belfast's Alex Fritz (76, third), Mount View's Austin Higgins (79, tie for fourth), Medomak Valley's Adam Wilcox (84, tie for eighth) and Mount View's Ross DeLorenzo (85, tie for 11th). \nMCI's Eric Dugas shot 71 and was medalist for Class B. \nIt is the fourth straight year Mazurek had qualified for the state individual championships, though it is his first foray in Class B. Oceanside played in Class A the past few years before transitioning to Class B this season. \nLast year, Mazurek won a share of the state Class A title and will try and win the Class B championship this year. \nIt is the second straight year Fritz and DeLorenzo have qualified for the individual championships and Higgins' second time qualifying overall. Higgins qualified as a freshman before taking two years off from high school golf before returning to the Mustangs this season. \nIn Tuesday's girls qualifier, eight student-athletes made the cut, including Mount View's Cassidy Gerrish (96, ninth) and Belfast's Madison Hemingway (110, 11th). \nTwo Lion golfers — Alexia Sweet and Katy King — fired 111 and missed the cut by one stroke. Sweet qualified for the state championship last year. \nThis year is the third straight year Gerrish qualified for the schoolgirl championships. \nLincoln Academy's Bailey Plourde shot 72 — nine shots ahead of second-place teammate Marla Springe (81) — and was medalist on the day. Plourde, who tied for a share of the individual schoolgirl championship in 2013, plays golf in the summer at the Samoset Resort in Rockport. \nOther Midcoast golfers' scores from Tuesday's qualifier were: \nCamden Hills — Braden Fisher, 93; Connor Russell, 97; James Orne, 102; and Max Horowitz, 105. \nOceanside — Ryan Lawrence, 89; Aiden Andrews, 112; Abe LeMole, 124; Teddy Hallett, 130; and Trevor Lawry, no card. \nBelfast — Doyle Bailey, 100; Parker LaFrance, 139; Alexis Sweet, 111; Katy King, 111; Macy Gale, 122; Kristina Walker, 123, and Emma Mehuren, 126. \nMount View — Darrell Roberts, 90; Stephen Koller, 97; Joe Danna, 103; Westley Turner, 104; and Kasey Roberts, 116. \nMedomak Valley — Brent Stewart, 107; and Nathan Emerson, 119.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:08:53.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
