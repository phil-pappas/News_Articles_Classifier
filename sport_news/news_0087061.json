He called it \"sir\" so many times that it drew a few smirks out of the oddity of him doing so.\nOther than that, Northcutt, the youngest fighter in the UFC, looked like an octagon veteran with his 57-second first-round knockout of Francisco Trevino.\nThe Aggie, who has fought at the amateur level in countries like Ireland and Croatia, said that he wasn't nervous when he was walking into the Octagon.\n\"You think that you'd be pumped up so much that your adrenaline is going,\" he said. \"I was pumped up a lot, but I was calm. Out there in the ring I could pick out people's heads and see everybody out there in the audience. Once the fight started it was like slow motion pretty much. It just felt incredible.\"\nNorthcutt was able to pressure his opponent early. He said that he threw a couple of kicks Trevino's way to see how he'd react. After a kick or two, Northcutt pounced throwing punches left and right. When Trevino slipped, he took him down to the mat and started pounding Trevino's face with elbows.\nWhen referee Herb Dean called the fight 57 seconds into the first round, Trevino was visibly upset. So upset that he shoved the official. Northcutt said the gesture didn't bother him.\n\"He [Trevino] might not see it as legitimate, maybe it's because I'm younger,\" he said. \"I don't know. Mr. Dean, Herb Dean, he knows what he's doing. He's an official in the UFC. He knows how to stop fights and when to let them go. He has the call. It wasn't my call. It wasn't Trevino's call or his coach's call. It's ultimately [Dean's] call. He knows what he's doing.\"\nNorthcutt did acknowledge the fact that his popularity is on the rise. So much so that he could see an increase in opportunities to fight. So where does that leave his studies at A&M?\n\"It is pretty tough,\" he said of studying petroleum engineering. \"That's why I've cut back on a few classes and the workload just a little bit. I'm still going to A&M and taking those classes, but not quite as many so I'd have to train. This fight I actually got to train for, unlike my other fights.\"\nThe teenager showed his eagerness to get back into the octagon after his fight.\n\"I'm ready right now. If I could fight two fights in this night, I'd go fight right now,\" he said. \"I'm ready. I feel great, strong, no injuries. Nothing. I would have to cut weight really quick before I go back out there. So that might take a little bit.\"\nNorthcutt said that, if given the chance to train full time and put off school for the moment, \"it might be scary\" for other fighters in the lightweight division.\n\"I feel incredibly strong. I feel fast,\" he said. \"Y'all have yet to see what I can do at 155.\"\nFollow Joshua Friemel on Twitter at @Josh_Friemel .\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel"], "published": "2015-10-04T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:05:49.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
