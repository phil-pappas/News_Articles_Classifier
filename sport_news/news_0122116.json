When they return from the bye, teams are going to be coming after Rob Gronkowski, especially if the big scores keep piling up.\nIt’s bad enough teams loathe the Patriots just for being the Patriots. But with them croaking everyone, Gronkowski now has a target squarely on him and his knees.\nAt least, that’s what former Patriot Rodney Harrison and others believe, and if the Pats aren’t careful during blowouts, they just might lose the one player that puts them over the top if you’re talking about adding another Super Bowl.\n“(Bill) Belichick always preaches finish 50 minutes, 60 minutes, don’t give up. But at the same time, you have to understand, because you are the most-hated team, because people understand the value of Rob Gronkowski, you’ve got to get him out of the game,” Harrison told the Herald. “Look, there’s a lot of guys out there that are jealous. There’s a lot of guys out there that have nothing to lose, a lot of guys out there that want to make a name for themselves. These are guys that will go at his legs and tear his ACL. As good as (Tom) Brady is, if they don’t have Gronk, they’re not winning the Super Bowl.”\nWas Harrison, currently an NBC analyst, being a little too over-dramatic, or over the top with these claims of players purposely shooting for Gronk’s knees?\nNFL Network analyst Solomon Wilcots didn’t think so. He agreed with Harrison’s take.\n“Rodney’s right,” Wilcots said when reached Tuesday. “I can tell you, in the league now, where they don’t give you many target areas, you can’t go for the head anymore, you have to go for the knees. And you combine that with trying to run it up on a team and how they’re going to feel about that, it opens the door for that, no doubt.”\nWilcots, in fact, indicated he was in on a chat with Rex Ryan last week during a production meeting for Buffalo’s game in Miami, and the Bills coach said flat out that’s what the Patriots were trying to do during their Week 2 win at Orchard Park — run up the score. Ryan, who can’t seem to get the Patriots out of his head, has actually been yapping about that for days, and made mention of it again yesterday.\n“Rex Ryan said he felt his team began to fight back in the fourth quarter of the Patriots game because, ‘That team was trying to bury us. I know that coach (Belichick). They were trying to bury us,’ ” Wilcots said, relaying his conversation with Ryan. “Look, the Patriots, if they get their foot on your throat, they don’t let up. We’ve seen it in other games. They’ll score 55 on you. The proof is there. I don’t have a problem with that. You have to put these teams away.”\nBut at what cost?\nIt was interesting to note that with the game well in hand against the Jaguars on Sunday, Belichick removed his All-Pro tight end from harm’s way in passing situations as early as the end of the third quarter, only putting him in to block down by the goal line. It’s something that wasn’t done the previous week against Buffalo.\nSo Belichick is probably keen to where teams might be focusing their hits. Either that or Sergio Brown’s takeout of Gronkowski right before halftime made it clear what was at stake.\nThe Pats were up 13-3 and moving in for another score, when Brady hit Gronk with a pass down the middle. It was one of their patented seam routes, as the Jaguars fielded two safeties deep. Gronkowski barely took a stride before being greeted by Brown, who caught the tight end in the knee area.\nThe play didn’t draw much attention because the Jaguars were called for roughing the passer. Gronk, however, got up a little gingerly after that hit.\nWilcots certainly noticed the play and the significance. The hit was legal, but it brought back memories of the T.J. Ward hit that took out Gronk in Week 15 of 2013, tearing his ACL.\n“I saw that play, and it crossed my mind, it really did,” Wilcots said.\nWas Brown, who has a history with Gronkowski, being thrown “out of the club” last season, sending a message? Or was it just how teams have to try to bring down a mammoth guy like Gronk nowadays?\nMaybe all of it factors in.\nFor the record, when we asked him about it yesterday, Gronkowski said he wasn’t worried about anyone deliberately taking his knees out.\n“I’m not nervous at all,” he said. “It’s the game of football. You can’t go out there with any fear. I’m gonna get hit. You just have to be prepared for all of that. I have to be prepared for low (hits), high (hits), whatever it is. As long as it’s within the rules, I’m cool with it.”\nWhether it’s Gronkowski or Julian Edelman, defenses haven’t found a way to stop either of Brady’s favorite targets.\nGronkowski has caught four touchdown passes in the first three games, all coming in the red zone. He’s also been lethal blocking in the running game.\nThe problems he creates, the inability of teams to cover him, his sheer dominance, has given rise to the notion he could go down as the best tight end of all time.\n“What happens to the Patriots if they don’t have Gronk? Think about that?” said Wilcots. “Outside of Brady, he’s their next most important player. That’s what’s at stake. Especially after losing Vince (Wilfork), and (Darrelle) Revis and those secondary guys, they’re going to have to outscore a lot of people.\n“I hate to say they got no shot without Gronk, but without him, that really sets them back and this is no longer a team that can rely on the defense to carry them to the championship. That was last year.”\nHarrison said every time Gronkowski goes over the middle, he takes pause, but especially in places like Buffalo where there’s bad blood. He knows how much people hate the Patriots.\n“I’m sitting there watching the games, and I’m holding my breath every time I see Gronk or Edelman, or one of them guys go across the middle,” Harrison said. “I’m like holding my breath. I’m nervous. I’m hoping they don’t get taken out.”\nThat would spoil the party, no question.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:22:44.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
