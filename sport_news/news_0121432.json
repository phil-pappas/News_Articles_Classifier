On the field, it’s a critical game for each side’s chances of playoff contention, since San Diego is 2-4 and Oakland 2-3 following a bye week.\nIn the stands it will be contentious, likely with a large number of fans dressed in silver and black. To guard against potential fan unruliness, Qualcomm Stadium concessionaires will cut off beer sales at the beginning of the third quarter.\nRaider Diaspora, that subset of fans who never abandoned the team even after its return to Oakland from Los Angeles in 1995, will savor the idea that this game won’t require a Southwest Airlines boarding pass.\nAnd San Diegans, especially those weary of the Chargers’ flirtation with the Los Angeles area, certainly aren’t hesitant to re-sell their tickets. Lots of them almost certainly will wind up in the hands of Raiders fans.\nOh, and about that flirtation?\nThe teams may be foes, and each set of fans may look at the other side with contempt, but Chargers owner Dean Spanos and Raiders owner Mark Davis will be simpatico, drawn together by their joint vision of a $1.7 billion stadium in Carson. They’ll probably share a conversation before the game, and who knows? They might even watch from the same suite.\nIn fact, there were reports Friday that Davis and Spanos were seen together at the Chargers Park training facility. If so, I wonder how that went over with Mike McCoy, the Chargers’ famously secretive coach.\nThe mere idea of the Chargers and Raiders going into business together, when the teams announced their joint venture Feb. 19, struck San Diego fans as the worst indignity and last straw. Among the comments on Twitter at the time of the announcement:\n“Has hell frozen over?!”\n“If the Chargers are so desperate they’d share a stadium with their blood rival, on top of a dump in sad-sack Carson, then good riddance.”\n“As a San Diegan, this feels like (a) slap in the face.”\n“If the Chargers move to Carson with the Raiders, I will burn every Chargers thing I have and mail the ashes to Dean Spanos.”\nThe feeling in San Diego has remained fairly straightforward since, while Chargers management has slapped down the city’s various stadium concepts.\nSome fans will remain loyal as long as the team remains in town. Others will watch the team on TV and not put a dime in Spanos’ pockets. Still others are the above-mentioned season ticket subscribers, who obviously figure that if Spanos is chasing the dollar, why shouldn’t they?\nAnd the vast, vast majority of all of those groups are adamant that if the Chargers move up the freeway, they will cut ties.\nRaiders fans’ feelings are likely more conflicted. Their team has few stadium options in Oakland, compared with last-ditch efforts launched by civic officials in San Diego and St. Louis (and being ignored by the Chargers and Rams, the other franchise angling to land in L.A.). The Raiders also have the least leverage of the three teams eyeing what probably will be two spots in one stadium.\nTheir fans in Northern California are fearing the worst. Their fans in SoCal are hoping for the team’s return.\nAs for the guys who will actually play the game? Any historic rivalry or business partnership is less important to the Chargers than the idea of winning their first game this season against an AFC West Division opponent.\n“Rivalries are probably more of a college term, to be honest with you,” quarterback Philip Rivers said. “There’s more to it because you’re in the same state and the fans … you’re (for) one or the other for the most part, if you live out here.\n“But we’ve got a lot of guys on this team (for whom) the Raiders vs. the Chargers didn’t mean anything to them for 22 years of their lives, and all of a sudden now it’s this big thing.”\nPlayers try to ignore the relocation issue. Fans have either obsessed over it or gone into denial – though that last option was pretty much eliminated Friday when Mark Fabiani, Spanos’ point man on stadium matters, confirmed that the Chargers would indeed file for relocation in January.\nThe NFL is holding a town hall meeting Wednesday night at the Spreckels Theatre, which will at least give San Diegans a chance to vent but probably won’t change anything.\nBut consider: The Carson project is competing with Rams owner Stan Kroenke and his project in Inglewood. Should Kroenke’s project get the approval of NFL owners, Spanos could partner on that project.\nIf that happens … well, how would “San Diego Raiders” sound?\nHey, loyalty is a two-way street.\nContact the writer: jalexander@pe.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:09:03.470+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
