(Matt Hickman • Williston Herald) WILLISTON — Sporting the pink uniforms that have become synonymous with Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the Williston State Tetons snapped a five-match losing streak and closed out their season at The Well with a four-set win over Dakota College of Bottineau. “We were playing as a team and actually finishing,” said sophomore Hannah Ware. “When we were losing we had no energy, just giving up, so energy is definitely big for us.” The Tetons close the regular season mark with a record of 12-18 and a conference mark of 4-4. On Saturday, Oct. 24 in Bottineau, the Tetons open sub-regionals, facing the Jacks once again. “They really had the energy tonight, especially the sophomores really stepped up,” WSC head coach Katelynn Christiansen said. “Everybody came together and they really wanted to end that losing streak. They used that energy and played through it.” After storming to wins in the first two sets, the Tetons found themselves playing from behind in the third game, but managed to fight off eight Jacks’ chances at game point, a rally that started on a kill by Alycia McGlothlin and ended on another kill by her on the seventh straight serve of McKenna DeMoe. One away from completing the run, the Tetons had the double block set up, but the carom didn’t go in their favor and the Jacks came away with the 25-23 win. That momentum carried over to the fourth game, however, as the Tetons powered to a 9-2 lead and won going away, 25-10. “The third set we messed around with the rotation, going to a 6-2… obviously that didn’t work,” Ware said. “At the end, we had the momentum and we had to keep it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:08:19.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
