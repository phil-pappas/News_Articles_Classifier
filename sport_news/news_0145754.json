Goodwin re-signing boosts Bunnies backline \nCoach Michael Maguire put one of the last pieces of his backline puzzle in place with Bryson Goodwin re-signing with South Sydney for another two NRL seasons. \nGoodwin was off-contract at the end of 2015 but has agreed to stay at Redfern, bolstering the Rabbitohs’ backline. \nKirisome Auva’a remains the only member of the Bunnies’ starting outside backs not to have re-committed for 2016 however he has been in discussions with the club for several months. \n“Bryson has been one of our most consistent players over the past twelve months and he has given his all to any job we have put in front on him,” Maguire said. \n“We have a young backline so his experience at NRL and international level is very valuable to us. \nThe Rabbitohs have also lured former Manly and Sydney Roosters winger Michael Oldfield back to Australia following a two-year stint in the Super League with Catalans Dragons. \nThe 24-year-old, who has made 69 NRL appearances for Manly and Sydney Roosters, will add depth to the Rabbitohs squad. \n“Michael will also add experience to our backline and will create more competition for spots which is always a good thing at a football club,” Maguire said.
