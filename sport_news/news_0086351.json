The popular beach city of Puerto Vallarta and the port of Manzanillo were spared the brunt of the violent weather. \nAuthorities were still trying to reach some of the hardest-hit areas, which were blocked by downed trees, but the devastation appeared to be far less than feared. \nThere were no reports of deaths or injuries, said Roberto Lopez Lara, interior secretary for the state of Jalisco. It was a remarkable outcome, considering that Patricia had been a Category 5 hurricane with winds up to 200 mph (325 kph) before coming ashore with slightly less power in an area dotted with sleepy villages and a few upscale hotels. \nHours later, as the storm spun inland, it collapsed into fast-moving bands of rain aimed at already sodden Texas. \n___ \n4 dead, including 2-year-old, after crash at Oklahoma State homecoming parade; driver arrested \nSTILLWATER, Okla. (AP) — A woman suspected of driving under the influence plowed into a crowd Saturday during the Oklahoma State University homecoming parade, killing four people — including a toddler — and injuring dozens more in a collision that sent some spectators flying through the air. \nStillwater police Capt. Kyle Gibbs said the woman’s Hyundai Elantra struck an unoccupied motorcycle of an officer who was working security at the parade, then went into the crowd. She was taken into custody, and Gibbs said investigators were awaiting the results of blood tests to determine if she was impaired by drugs or alcohol. \nOklahoma University Medical Center and The Children’s Hospital announced in a statement Saturday night that a 2-year-old was the fourth person to die from injuries suffered in the morning crash. Five children and three adults remained hospitalized with conditions ranging from good to critical, officials said. Gibbs had said earlier that 34 people were taken to the hospital. \nPolice said Adacia Chambers, 25, of Stillwater, was arrested on the DUI charge. \n“We treat these like we would any homicide investigation,” Gibbs said. “It’ll probably take several days to get additional information as to the cause of the accident.” \n___ \nKerry says video monitoring of Jerusalem holy site to ease tensions that sparked violence \nJERUSALEM (AP) — Looking to reduce tensions at a Jerusalem holy site that set off weeks of Mideast violence, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry announced Saturday that Israel and Jordan had agreed on steps, including round-the-clock video monitoring, to bring an end to the unrest. \nBut the announcement contained few details on how the monitoring system would work, and it was not immediately clear whether it would be enough to calm the unrest that has raised fears that the region is on the brink of a new round of heavy fighting. \nLate Saturday, Israel said it welcomed “increased coordination” with the Jordanians. There was no immediate Palestinian reaction. \nKerry had spent several days holding talks with Israeli and Arab leaders, capping his efforts with meetings Saturday with the Palestinians and Jordan. Kerry said King Abdullah II of Jordan suggested the monitoring and that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted. \n“All the violence and the incitement to violence must stop. Leaders must lead,” Kerry told reporters in the Jordanian capital after meeting with the king and with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas. \n___ \nTrump jabs Bush in home-state Florida: Ex-governor can’t run campaign, shouldn’t run country \nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump mocked former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in his own state on Saturday, saying recent campaign cuts show he’s not ready to be president. \n“Here’s a guy who wants to run our country, and he can’t even run his own campaign. And you know what? He’s cutting back big,” Trump told a raucous crowd of thousands gathered along the riverfront of one of Florida’s most conservative cities. \nThe comment came the day after the Bush campaign said it was cutting payroll by 40 percent by trimming staff and requiring an across the board pay cut for those remaining. \nTrump said Bush, the son and brother for former presidents, is “losing badly and embarrassing his family.” \n“Bush has no money. He’s cutting. He’s meeting today with mommy and daddy and they’re working on their campaign,” Trump said. \n___ \nLaser treatments may ease pain for ‘napalm girl’ decades after attack captured in AP photo \nMIAMI (AP) — In the photograph that made Kim Phuc a living symbol of the Vietnam War, her burns aren’t visible — only her agony as she runs wailing toward the camera, her arms flung away from her body, naked because she has ripped off her burning clothes. \nMore than 40 years later she can hide the scars beneath long sleeves, but a single tear down her otherwise radiant face betrays the pain she has endured since that errant napalm strike in 1972. \nNow she has a new chance to heal — a prospect she once thought possible only in a life after death. \n“So many years I thought that I have no more scars, no more pain when I’m in heaven. But now — heaven on earth for me!” Phuc says upon her arrival in Miami to see a dermatologist who specializes in laser treatments for burn patients. \nLate last month, Phuc, 52, began a series of laser treatments that her doctor, Jill Waibel of the Miami Dermatology and Laser Institute, says will smooth and soften the pale, thick scar tissue that ripples from her left hand up her arm, up her neck to her hairline and down almost all of her back. \n___ \nObama encouraging limits on standardized tests, less ‘obsessing’ about testing \nWASHINGTON (AP) — Addressing one of education’s most divisive issues, President Barack Obama on Saturday called for capping standardized testing at 2 percent of classroom time and said the government shares responsibility for turning tests into the be-all and end-all of American schools. \nStudents spend about 20 to 25 hours a school year taking standardized tests, according to a study of the nation’s 66 largest school districts that was released Saturday by the Council of the Great City Schools. But it’s not known how much class time students spend preparing for tests that became mandatory, starting in third grade, under the George W. Bush-era No Child Left Behind law and are a flashpoint in the debate over the Common Core academic standards. \n“Learning is about so much more than just filling in the right bubble,” Obama said in a video released on Facebook. “So we’re going to work with states, school districts, teachers, and parents to make sure that we’re not obsessing about testing.” \nTo drive the point home, Obama and Education Secretary Arne Duncan plan an Oval Office meeting Monday with teachers and school officials working to reduce testing time. \nAnd from the 2016 presidential campaign, Democratic contender Hillary Rodham Clinton embraced the principles laid out by Obama. “We should be ruthless in looking at tests and eliminating them if they do not actually help us move our kids forward,” she said in a statement. \n___ \nCatholic bishops call for a more welcoming church, discernment for individual cases \nVATICAN CITY (AP) — Catholic bishops called Saturday for a more welcoming church for cohabitating couples and Catholics who have divorced and civilly remarried, endorsing Pope Francis’ call for a more merciful and less judgmental church. \nBishops from around the world adopted a final document at the end of a divisive, three-week synod that exposed the split in the church between conservatives and progressives over how to better minister to Catholic families today. \nIn a win for the progressive camp, the document emphasized the role of discernment and individual conscience in dealing with difficult family situations, especially the vexing issue of whether civilly remarried Catholics can receive Communion. \nConservatives had resisted offering any wiggle room on the issue, since church teaching holds that such Catholics are committing adultery and are therefore barred from receiving the sacraments. While the document doesn’t chart any specific path to receiving Communion as originally sought by the liberals, it opens the door to case-by-case exceptions. \n“We are so happy that we could give this to the pope,” said German Cardinal Reinhard Marx, who spearheaded the progressive camp on the issue. He called the document a “historic step.” \n___ \nNigeria experts: Support for trafficking victims equally important as fight against vice \nLAGOS, Nigeria (AP) — In a Lagos suburb, 22-year-old Omo huddles over her battered cell phone, scrolling through text messages to find the name of the Russian city where she was coerced into prostitution. \nIt was two years ago and she had just finished her exams to enter university when her mother introduced her to an agent promising a sales job in Russia. She agreed to go hoping for a better future. “I wanted to assist myself and my family, because I really wanted to go to school,” she said. \nWhen she arrived in Pyatigorsk, a mountain city with a renowned health resort, her travel documents were taken from her and she was told she would be selling her body. \n“They said if I don’t do it they will kill me,” she said, staring at the floor. “It was hell.” \nNigeria, Africa’s most populous country with 170 million people, is a regional hub for human trafficking, and more assistance is needed to help those who escape the exploitation to find a stable place back in Nigeria, say experts who work with survivors. \n___ \nMaureen O’Hara, spirited star of ‘Miracle on 34th Street,’‘The Quiet Man,’ dies at 95 \nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Fiery-haired and feisty, Maureen O’Hara could handle anything the world and Hollywood threw at her. Director John Ford punched her in the jaw at a party and John Wayne dragged her through sheep dung — real sheep dung — in “The Quiet Man.” In “Miracle on 34th Street” she learned to believe in Santa Claus. \nBut first and foremost, she always believed in herself. \n“I do like to get my own way,” she said in a 1991 interview with The Associated Press. “There have been crushing disappointments. But when that happens, I say, ‘Find another hill to climb.'” \nThe Irish-born beauty was 95 when she died Saturday in her sleep at her home in Boise, Idaho, said Johnny Nicoletti, her longtime manager. \nIn her heyday, O’Hara was known as the Queen of Technicolor because of the camera’s love affair with her vivid hair, bright green eyes and pale complexion. \n___ \nServing up a tasty World Series: Plucky Royals vs. pitching-rich Mets, plus BBQ and bagels \nYoenis Cespedes launching long drives, Lorenzo Cain dashing to catch them. Noah Syndergaard zinging 100 mph heat, Alcides Escobar trying to catch up. \nThe pitching-rich New York Mets, boosted by Daniel Murphy’s power surge. The plucky Kansas City Royals, constantly pressuring opponents and aiming to atone for last year’s near-miss. \nA tasty World Series, served up with some BBQ and bagels. A dead even one, too, beginning Tuesday night at Kauffman Stadium. \n“I opened it as a pick,” Johnny Avello, head oddsmaker at the Wynn Las Vegas, said Saturday. “I don’t remember doing that before in the World Series.” \n“The Mets, they have that pitching staff that’s been unbelievable in the postseason and they can set up their rotation,” he said. “The Royals have the home field and all that experience. They were glad to make it there last time, and now they’re looking for the W.” Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:04:46.406+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
