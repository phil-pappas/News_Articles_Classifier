The result was an 82-yard touchdown run by senior fullback Davey O’Haren and an early 7-0 lead. \nBy halftime, however, Heritage battled back for a 10-10 tie before the Hawks’ defense helped push the team ahead for good. \n“It’s a great win,” Heritage head coach D.J. Clay said. “First of all, hats off to Holy Spirit. They’ve been playing a lot of teams close and they’ve been getting after it. That’s a scrappy bunch over there. I told my guys it was going to be hard to win the game on Homecoming because you always want to ruin another team’s Homecoming.” \nThe win evened Heritage’s overall record at 4-4, but, more importantly, moved the Hawks’ GISA Region 1-AAA record to 3-1 heading into a trip to Dominion Christian. \n“We are still in control of our own destiny,” Clay said. “One of our goals was to go undefeated in region. That’s over. But we still have a chance to win our last two games and host a playoff game and that was one of our final goals.” \nDespite giving up an early touchdown, interceptions for Heritage by Matt Henson, Patrick Griffies and Matt Burns either snuffed out Cougar drives or gave the Hawks prime field position. \n“Anytime you get three interceptions against an option team, you’ve done something good,” Clay said. \nMatt Henson also led the victory with 10 tackles while Hamp Smith and Jake LaMarca finished with eight and seven, respectively. \nThe Hawks chipped away at their early deficit starting with David Barber’s 30-yard field goal with 7:32 left in the first half. \nHoly Spirit came back with a kick of its own from 36 yards to regain a seven-point advantage. \nFrom there, however, Heritage grabbed momentum for good starting with a four-play, 78-yard scoring drive that ended on a one-yard run by Hamp Smith. \nCountering Holy Spirit’s big play, Hawks junior quarterback Jacob Bryant connected on a 73-yard strike to Matt Burns to the Cougars’ 5-yard line before Smith carried it in the rest of the way. \n“It was a tough first half,” Clay said. “But our guys went in and made some adjustments and those guys came out firing on all cylinders in the second half. \nIt was the first of three touchdowns from Smith, who finished with 135 yards on 18 carries. \nHoly Spirit hurt itself in the third quarter on a botched field-goal snap from the Heritage 17-yard line that could have broken the 10-10 tie. Instead, the Hawks marched nine plays in the opposite direction. A scoring drive ended with Smith scoring from two yards out to put Heritage ahead for good. \nAhead 17-10, the Hawks came up with a special teams play while stopping Holy Spirit on a fake punt. That set up a 62-yard run by Smith that pushed Heritage’s lead to 28-10. \nWith five minutes left, Heritage then put the game out of reach when Griffies’ interception gave the Hawks the ball at the Cougars’ 28. \nBryant, who went 6-for-12 for 151 yards, completed a pass to Smith for a 22-yard gain before scoring on a keeper from six yards. \nHawks 30, Cougars 17 \nHoly Spirit 7 3 0 7-- 17 \nHeritage School 0 10 7 13-- 30 \n1st quarter \nHS — Davey O’Haren 82 run (John Radosta kick), 5:49 \n2nd quarter \nTHS — David Barber 30-yard field goal; 7:32 \nHS — Radosta 36-yard field goal; 2:01 \nTHS — Hamp Smith 1 run (Barber kick) :42 \n3rd quarter \nTHS — Smith 2 run (Barber kick) 1:54 \n4th quarter \nTHS — Smith 62 run (Barber kick) 11:40 \nTHS — Jacob Bryant 6 run (kick failed) 5:15 \nHS — Conner Whelan 5 run (Radosta kick) 3:04 More", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:51:39.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
