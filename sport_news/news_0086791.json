The right-hander began the season at Triple-A Columbus, a demotion that served as a wake-up call for the 25-year-old, who bounced back and tied Carlos Carrasco for the team lead in wins. \nBryan Shaw worked out of a jam in the eighth, and Cody Allen got three outs for his 34th save. \nThe Indians battled inconsistency all season and finished 81-80, only the second time they were above .500 after April 9. \nBoston starter Rick Porcello (9-15) came up short in his bid to hit double-digit wins for the seventh straight season. He allowed 10 hits in seven innings. <!--iframe--> Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1LcylEq TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T01:24:23.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
