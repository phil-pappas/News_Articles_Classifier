Powell wrote in \"Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen\" that McGee paid her $10,000 for 22 shows from 2010-14 with many taking place at the players' Billy Minardi Hall dormitory.\nPowell and daughters Shay, Lindsay and Rod Ni — all of whom Powell writes performed shows with her — appeared on the show with Powell's attorney Larry Wilder. They talked about an hour before McGee's resignation was announced.\nWilder of Jeffersonville, Indiana, said the crime of selling sex for money in Kentucky is a Class A misdemeanor with a one-year statute of limitations for prosecution. There is no such limitation for the promotion of prostitution, which Wilder said is a Class D felony. It is punishable by one to five years in prison.\nThe attorney added that if Powell is prosecuted, \"then they need to prosecute McGee as well because Mr. McGee participated by contacting Miss Powell, paying for the parties and paying for the provision of sex.\"\nPowell described her involvement as \"fun\" and shrugged off criticism of including her daughters in the shows. Rod Ni Powell added, \"going to the dorm and being around the basketball players. ... was fun.\"\nPowell's book has led to four separate investigations, including one by Louisville campus police, which announced on Oct. 6 that it was working with Louisville Metro Police and the Commonwealth's Attorney's Office to review the allegations for possible criminal charges.\nJeff Cooke, spokesman for the Jefferson County Commonwealth's Attorney, said Friday that investigations by prosecutors and police are ongoing and that there was \"nothing to report at this time.\"\nThere were also investigations launched by the athletic department and NCAA when the school was notified of the allegations in late August.\nThe University of Louisville Foundation announced the hiring of a law firm two days later to review the allegations.\nPitino has denied knowledge of the activities described in Powell's book.\nBut on Tuesday, Powell said on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" that with \"a boatload\" of recruits and dancers, \"loud music, alcohol, security, cameras\" in a campus dormitory, \"how could Rick not know?\"\nUMKC said it would have no further comment while investigations being conducted by it, the University of Louisville and the NCAA are ongoing.\nScott C. Cox, McGee's Louisville-based attorney, didn't immediately return messages from The Associated Press on Friday seeking comment.\n___\nAssociated Press writer Bill Draper in Kansas City, Missouri, and Claire Galofaro in Louisville, Kentucky, contributed to this report.\n2 CONNECT 12 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
