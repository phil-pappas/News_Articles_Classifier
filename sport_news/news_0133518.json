The one that definitively answers the question of whether the getting-the-band-back-together approach can work for the Avalanche? The one that settles the issue of whether Joe Sakic and Patrick Roy, the franchise's two greatest players during its 20-year run in Denver, can capably run and coach an NHL team?\n\"I don't even look at it like that,\" Sakic said. \"But everything went well in Year 1, and we got off to a bad start last year and played better at the end. But this is the year that we're going to learn a lot about ourselves, that's for sure.\n\"After last year, I know the disappointment. I think we learned a lot about getting ready for the season, and our expectations are to get off to a good start, because we know we need to in our division.\"\nAs the Avalanche's 2014-15 regular-season opener against Minnesota on Thursday night at the Pepsi Center approached, Roy reshaped the question.\nWATCH: How have the Colorado Avalanche improved its blue line?\n\"I'm not going to answer it that way,\" he said during the exhibition season. \"They're all important years.\"\nTwo seasons ago, the answer to that question about Sakic and Roy's capability seemed obvious.\nAfter what amounted to a two-year front-office internship as an executive adviser, Sakic moved up to become executive vice president and general manager in May 2013, and one of his first moves was to oversee the hire of his former teammate and fellow Hockey Hall of Famer, Roy, as head coach.\nAdvertisement WATCH: Will the Colorado Avalanche be better on offense this year?\nThe ensuing 2013-14 season was remarkable — a stunningly consistent march to 112 points that broke down to identical records of 26-11-4 at home and on the road, and also 26-11-4 in each half, resulting in a Central Division title. A disappointing first-round playoff loss to Minnesota couldn't ruin that season, especially since the Avalanche had gone from second-worst in the league in the lockout-shortened 2012-13 season to third in the NHL. Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the NHL's coach of the year, and it seemed that Sakic's front-office decision making was as good as his peerless wrist shot.\nPatrick Roy enters his third season behind the Avalanche's bench facing some questions about his coaching ability. ( Andy Cross, The Denver Post ) Stuck in lower gear Then the wheels — or at least the skate blades — came off last season, with the Avalanche finishing last in the Central Division with a 39-31-12 record and 90 points. One of the problems was that the Avalanche had slightly retooled with toughening for the postseason in mind, and subtly created the impression that regular-season regression would be acceptable. The Avs couldn't get out of that lower gear.\nOften outshot and spending too much time in its own zone, the Avalanche was one of the league's enigmas, with a roster dotted by young phenoms — including Matt Duchene, Gabe Landeskog, Ryan O'Reilly and Nathan MacKinnon — that in general didn't live up to expectations. The power play was mystifyingly horrible. And Sakic's judgment was questioned in such things as signing defensemen Nate Guenin and Nick Holden and backup goaltender Reto Berra to contract extensions.\nSo ...\nWhich season was the aberration and which was the true measure of the Sakic-Roy partnership?\nThe answer is that there is no simple answer, at least not yet, but that this year's offseason moves — including the signing of free-agent defenseman Francois Beauchemin to play with Erik Johnson in the top pairing — addressed some of the concerns. O'Reilly, perceived to be unsignable to an extension given his camp's financial expectations, was sent to Buffalo with Jamie McGinn for a package that included young Russians Nikita Zadorov and Mikhail Grigorenko. Among the several other moves, the Avs also acquired the rights to Boston center Carl Soderberg shortly before he was to become an unrestricted free agent and signed him to a long-term deal.\n\"I like the mix with veterans and younger guys on defense,\" Roy said. \"Forwards, the same thing. ... Depth is something we thought we had to work on, and we did it.\"\nJust get to the playoffs The reality remains that in the NHL, where any team making the postseason has a bona fide chance of winning the Stanley Cup, especially if the goaltender perfects the art of standing on his head, tweaking the roster with the postseason in mind makes perfect sense.\nAs long as you make the postseason.\nThe potentially awkward nature of the Sakic-Roy relationship is no secret. In a business that routinely scapegoats coaches and treats them with as much respect as disposable razors, the Colorado GM and coach twice shared the experience of raising the Stanley Cup overhead. Roy also has the title of vice president of hockey operations to reflect his stature and even his successful dues-paying experience as a GM and head coach at the major junior level with the Quebec Remparts. But at some point, the friendship will be tested.\n\"It's the same as Day One,\" Sakic said. \"We see things the same way. We have a really good relationship. We both have the same mind-set and the same goals for this organization. It's a group of us here. It's not just one or two people that make the decisions and everyone has input. Patty and I do discuss, and at the end of the day, I make the final call, but it's not without lots of input from our guys, especially Patrick.\"\nSaid Roy: \"Nothing has changed. We work really well together. There's a lot of respect. We've always worked well together. Every decision we're making, if it's from the coaching point of view or the GM point of view, we communicate well together.\"\nThe Avalanche also made coaching staff changes. The two former Quebec Major Junior Hockey League coaching opponents Roy brought with him to the Avalanche — Andre Tourigny, who handled the defensemen, and video coach Mario Duhamel — are gone. Former NHL defenseman and long-time NHL assistant Dave Farrish will replace Tourigny on the bench. Tim Army is the only holdover assistant.\n\"It was an easy decision,\" Roy said. \"Bear\" (Tourigny) wanted more responsibility, and I always believe we need to work as a team. From there, he resigned and it was important to me to bring in a veteran, someone who has won the Stanley Cup and someone who has played defense and someone who could help me to be even better.\"\nSakic said he and Roy conferred about the coaching staff after last season.\n\"Changes were going to be made,\" Sakic said. \"Just knowing the thought process and about what he wanted to do with the staff, I was all on board on that.\"\nDid Sakic dictate that Roy make staff changes?\n\"No, not at all,\" Sakic said. \"I believe the coaching staff needs to work really well together, and I'm not saying it didn't work well together, but I know Patrick felt we wanted to hire a more experienced coach on the D. Things obviously didn't work out last year. It was no one's fault. The coaching staff has to be one unit, and we made the decision to move forward.\"\nSakic and Roy, as they were as players, still are in this together.\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1007/20151007__20151008_B2_SP08HKNROYSAKIC~p1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:52:39.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
