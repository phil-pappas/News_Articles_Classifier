The NBA’s new nine-year, $24 billion media rights deals will kick in for the 2016–17 season, leading to a gigantic jump in the salary cap. As a reminder, the 2015–16 salary cap is set at $70 million, while the 2016–17 cap projects to be roughly $89 million. That one-year, $19 million jump nearly matches the total increase in cap size the league saw over the last 10 seasons combined (going from $49.5 million in 2005–06 to its current level).\nIf you’re still warming to the idea that Al-Farouq Aminu might be worth $30 million over four years or that Brandon Knight might represent decent value at $70 million over five years , then shield your eyes. The supply/demand relationship will be really out of whack next summer: While teams will have hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in new cap space to fill, there will be precious few star players for the taking.\nHere’s the list of 2015 All-Stars who can become free agents next summer: James, Durant, Pau Gasol , Al Horford , Dwyane Wade , Kobe Bryant , Tim Duncan and Dirk Nowitzki . From that group—which swells in number thanks to aging legacy players like Duncan and Wade on short-term deals—there are probably only three targets who might change teams: Durant, Horford and Gasol. All three play for contending-type teams currently, making pitches from outsiders that much more difficult.\n• MORE NBA: Best benches | Coaches under pressure | Over/under bets\nWhat happens if they use the same strategy as most of the 2015 free agency headliners and stay put? Second-tier and third-tier talents will get paid so much money . With that inevitable endgame in mind, let’s survey some of the most fascinating contract years that will play out over the next six months. Included with each player is a comparable contract signed this summer.\nNote: This post intends to highlight players who can cash in with strong 2015 –​ 16 seasons, so presumptive max players (James, Durant, Horford, Dwight Howard , etc.) and legacy stars (Bryant, Wade, Duncan, Nowitzki, etc.) are not included. This post also only includes potential unrestricted free agents. Ryan Anderson , Pelicans\n2015-16 salary: $8.5 million | Last contract: 4-years, $34 million\nAlthough Anderson’s time in New Orleans has been filled with trials and tribulations, as chronicled by SI’s Chris Ballard , the 6’10” stretch four is in position to end his current deal on a high note. One of the NBA’s most voluminous three-point shooting bigs for years, Anderson’s value has waned due to injuries and shooting slumps over the last two seasons. But the arrival of new coach Alvin Gentry and his up-tempo system should help put Anderson into situations where he is playing rather than thinking.\nNBA Reinventing the New Orleans Pelicans by Rob Mahoney", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/bengolliver"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:24:39.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
