I had my two center backs, (Bridget) Cerciello and (Erin) Donnelly , just really controlled everything. They got things going forward,\" Southern Lehigh coach Doug Roncolato said. \"My center mids were fantastic, especially my holding center mid Carryn Jurgens . She just dominated. And they were playing three in the middle against our two and we were still able to control how we wanted to control. Hailey Jordan , up top from her, was distributing so well. My forwards, my outside mids, they ran their butts off. My outside backs all night long were getting forward, creating opportunities. So they played the game the way you're supposed to play it.\" \nJurgens, Baleigh Bradley and Kaitlyn O'Brien tallied the goals for the Spartans, who won their first league title since 2011. Hailey Jordan and Melinda Gluck each had assists for Southern Lehigh. \nThe Spartans started the season 2-3 with non-conference losses to Pennridge, Quakertown and Perkiomen Valley. They went 13-2 the rest of the way. \n\"It's been difficult. It's been hard because we've had a few hard losses,\" Bradley said. \"But we picked it up. We really stepped up and I'm so happy we made it this far and we got the league championship.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T10:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:09:06.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
