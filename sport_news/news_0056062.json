Posted: Sunday, October 18, 2015 11:59 pm Deflating loss: Colts let opportunity slip away vs. Patriots By TOM JAMES CNHI NEWS SERVICE News and Tribune \nINDIANAPOLIS — It was billed as a game of Deflategate revenge for the New England Patriots, but Sunday night's nationally televised game turned into just one more lost opportunity for the Indianapolis Colts against their AFC rivals. \nIn a series where the Colts have been manhandled in recent meetings, Indianapolis was much more competitive this time against the Patriots. New England, though, came away with a 34-27 decision at Lucas Oil Stadium in front of an announced crowd of 66,726. \nThe Colts dropped to 3-3 with the loss and will face the New Orleans Saints this Sunday at Lucas Oil Stadium. New England, which came into the Indianapolis game as the National Football League's hottest team, improved to 5-0 for the season. \n\"We wanted to be aggressive. We wanted to attack [New England]. Credit them. They played well. They out-executed us and they had seven more [points] than we had at the end of the day. Our guys fought and played until the end,\" Indianapolis head coach Chuck Pagano said afterward. \"We did a lot of good things. Offensively we came out and started fast, put points on the board right away. We got a pick-six, but we gave up some things, couldn't get off the field on third down. We couldn't get anything going [offensively] in the third quarter.\" \nIndianapolis took a 21-20 lead into the locker room at halftime. It was the first time since the 2008 season that the Colts led New England at the half. \nLuck connected on a 5-yard scoring pass to wide receiver Donte Moncrief with 7:16 left in the first quarter. He later hooked up with wide receiver T.Y. Hilton on a 3-yard toss with 2:38 remaining in the first half. \nSafety Mike Adams came up with the football after Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman bobbled a pass from quarterback Tom Brady. Adams returned the interception 14 yards for a touchdown that gave the Colts a 14-10 lead with 11:30 left in the second quarter. \nBrady had touchdown passes to Edelman (12 yards), tight end Rob Gronkowski (25 yards) and running back LeGarrette Blount (11 yards). Blount, who had been a major thorn in the side of the Colts defense as a runner, broke loose for a 38-yard TD run with 9:33 left in the third quarter. \nNew England got some help from the Colts' special teams late in the third quarter when head coach Chuck Pagano decided to go for a fake punt with the ball at the Indianapolis 35-yard line. \nThe idea of the play was to either try and get the Patriots to jump off sides on fourth-and-2, catch New England with too many players on the field or be able to get the needed yardage with a run if the Colts got the right look. \nWide receiver Griff Whalen, who had initially lined up as an outside gunner on the punt coverage unit, moved over to hike the ball. Safety Colt Anderson then lined up as quarterback. \nWhalen was not supposed to snap the ball, instead trying to get the Patriots to jump offsides. The play backfired, however, when Whalen snapped the ball and Anderson was tackled for a loss. Also the entire right side of the Colts offensive line was offsides on the play. \nNew England declined the penalty and gained possession of the ball. The Patriots scored six plays later when Blount hauled in the touchdown pass from Brady. \nEarlier in the game, Indianapolis attempted a pooch kickoff that was very nearly recovered by Moncrief. After a scramble for the football, the Patriots were awarded possession. The Colts challenged the official's decision but lost the replay review. \n\"We challenged that [kickoff] play. Clearly on the replay we thought we saw a clean recovery and our people upstairs saw it. And when [Moncrief] came out of the pile with the ball, we felt like there was no way possible we could lose that,\" Pagano said. \"But obviously that was a huge deal in the game. We thought it was a great way to steal another [offensive] possession. On the punt play, I take full responsibility there. We weren't lined up correctly and we had a communication breakdown between the quarterback and the snapper. And that's all on me. I take full responsibility on that. I didn't do a good enough job of getting that communicated to the guys obviously.\" \nThe Colts coach admitted that the fake punt wound up being a crucial turning point in the game, \n\"It gave them field position in a crucial part of the game and the touchdown that resulted from that,\" he said. \"But, again, we face ourselves a chance at the end. Again, it's one game. We've got a lot of football left. We control our own destiny. We're .500. We can't have a hangover. We have to move on. We've got a good football team coming to town next week and we've got to get over this one.\" \nThe Colts scored a late touchdown when Luck engineered an 8-play, 85-yard drive that culminated in an 18-yard scoring strike to wide receiver Griff Whalen. It proved to be too little, too late for Indianapolis. \nLuck got off to a strong start after sitting out the previous two games with a right shoulder injury. He connected on eight of his first nine passes in the Colts first offensive possession and was the beneficiary of a great catch by Moncrief in the left front corner of the end zone that gave Indianapolis an early 7-0 lead. \nBoth Brady (23-of-37) and Luck (30-of-50) had 312 yards passing and three TD passes in the game. Blount had a game-high 93 yards rushing in 16 carries for New England. Frank Gore, meanwhile, paced the Colts rushing attack with 78 yards in 13 attempts. \nWide receiver Danny Amendola was the primary target for Brady, hauling in seven passes for 105 yards. Edelman added six receptions for 50 yards and a TD. Gronkowski, who has had plenty of success at the expense of the Colts in recent seasons, was limited to just three catches for 50 yards but did have a touchdown catch. \nHilton (74 yards) and Moncrief (69 yards) each had six receptions for the Colts. Indianapolis lost rookie safety Clayton Geathers with a sprained knee in the first half and he did not return. Adams left in the second half with a strained hamstring and was sidelined for the remainder of the game. \nPenalties continue to be an issue for Indianapolis. The Colts were flagged 11 times for 103 yards, with most of those penalties being called on the offensive line for holding. It's been an issue that has hindered Pagano's team all season long.
