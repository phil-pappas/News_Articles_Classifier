I’m so sorry,” Gracie told race engineer Paul Ceprnich on the team radio. \n“I’m coming back to the pits now. The steering’s stuffed.” \nThe all-female team had arrived at Mount Panorama with plenty to prove after old school V8 great Dick Johnson claimed they were “a million to one” of finishing their first Bathurst 1000. \nGracie fired back with: “Dick Johnson hasn’t finished heaps of races so he can’t talk”. \nThen there was Ford star David Reynolds’ ill advised remark that earned a $25,000 fine from V8 Supercars. \nIt had all appeared to steel Gracie who led off impressively after starting the Great Race in the pits to avoid the early carnage. \n“It’s a bit disappointing,” said Gracie who will return to Bathurst with de Silvestro next year. \n“We were off to a great start, had a great strategy and I caught the guys pretty quickly. \n“But unfortunately I was the first who caught the oil and found the wall.” \nIn all, 31 women have contested the Bathurst 1000 with a best placing of sixth – Australia’s Christine Gibson (1981) and France’s Marie-Claude Beaumont (1975).
