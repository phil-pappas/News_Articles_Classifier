(AP ... more > By - Associated Press   \nBUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Buffalo Sabres goalie Robin Lehner will not return to the game after appearing to hurt his left leg in the second period of the season opener against the Ottawa Senators on Thursday night. \nLehner was untouched when he circled his net, set himself in the crease and then grabbed at his left pad. He then went down on one knee while play continued up the ice. The Sabres announced Lehner sustained a lower-body injury. \nLehner allowed one goal on 12 shots, and was replaced by Chad Johnson. \nBuffalo gave up a first-round draft pick to acquire Lehner in a trade with Ottawa in June. He was playing his first game since sustaining a season-ending concussion in a 6-3 loss to Carolina on Feb. 16. \nCopyright Â© 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:54:32.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
