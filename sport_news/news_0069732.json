But since the top two teams move on to the state tournament, it didn't matter to Verot coach Ed Lockard that his team was edged out for first place. \n\"We had a team goal to get to the states this year and we did,\" said Lockard. \"We played excellent all year long. We were 11-1 in the regular season. Hallianne Hobson played great all year long and played great today. The whole team played really nice. It was fun to watch.\" \nLauren Lockard was actually the low scorer for the Vikings with an 83, followed by Hobson with an 84. Other players for Verot were Claire Sattler (100), Carolina Snell (107) and Rory Freeman (145). \nSaint Stephens, which carded a team score of 373, was paced by co-medalist Vanessa Yan, who shot a 78 to tie St. John Neumann's Sydney Shrader for first place. \nOther Lee County teams competing were Canterbury School, which finished sixth with a 474 total, and Southwest Florida Christian finished seventh with a total score of 485. \nThe other individual qualifier was Anna Marie Kuenzle of Seacrest Country Day, who shot an 85 to move on to next week's competition at the Mission Inn in Howey-In-The-Hills. \nBut Lockard says his team is not satisfied with just getting to the state tournament. \n\"We'd like to go up there and have a strong showing,\" said Lockard. \"We've got some kids that can play and who knows what can happen. But when you get to this level, there's some really stiff competition, four or five girls can shoot really low. But we've got some kids that certainly can and hopefully, we'll be right there.\" \nRegion A-6 girls golf tournament \n1. Saint Stephens 373 2. Bishop Verot 374 3. Community School of Naples 403 4.
