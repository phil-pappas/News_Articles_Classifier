Either way, they are a national-championship contender and are among the tallest orders Monmouth has ever dealt with. Saturday will mark the first time Monmouth has ever hosted the nation’s No. 1 team.\nBelow, we present three things to watch for when the Hawks host Coastal Carolina. Aside from the ESPN3 broadcast, the game will air on MonmouthHawks.com with Matt Harmon (play-by-play) and Eddy Occhipinti (color) on the call.\n1. Say hello to Alex Ross: Liberty quarterback Josh Woodrum served as a big test for Monmouth’s secondary, but so too will Alex Ross. A two-time All-Big South first team selection and the reigning Big South Offensive Player of the Year, the redshirt senior is off to another big start for Coastal. he has thrown for 1,242 yards, 10 touchdowns and just three interceptions while completing 68.1 percent of his passes. The 1,242 yards, 10 touchdowns and 68.1 percent completion percentage are all No. 1 in the Big South, while the completion percentage is No. 5 nationally. Last year in a 52-21 win over the Hawks in Conway, S.C., Ross was 21-for-34 for 255 yards and three touchdown passes.\n2. Keep an eye on time of possession: Monmouth beat Liberty despite the Flames having the ball for 35:42, while the Hawks had it for just 23:42. Within those numbers, the second quarter saw Liberty have the ball for 11:45. That said, a blocked field goal attempt ended an 18-play Liberty drive that saw it hold the ball for 11:04. Coastal Carolina’s offense is more uptempo, but its time of possession has been just OK. The Chanticleers average 29:46 for time of possession, which fourth in the seven-team Big South and 60th nationally among 123 FCS teams. Conversely, Monmouth averages 29:29, which is fifth in the Big South and 66th nationally.\n3. If Ross wasn’t enough, meet De’Angelo Henderson: A 2015 preseason All-American, the redshirt junior running back has rushed for 758 yards and eight touchdowns in just six games. Also the Big South-leader in all-purpose yards per game at 170.5, the Henderson’s 758 yards and eight touchdowns are both tops in the league as he joins Ross as a legitimate candidate for Offensive Player of the Year. Like Ross, Henderson had a strong game against Monmouth last fall, rushing for 110 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries.\nStaff writer Josh Newman: jnewman4@gannettnj.com\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1LRf0cv", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:05:35.704+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
