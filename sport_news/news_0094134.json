Alton Strupp/The Courier-Journal Katina Powell 41 CONNECT 35 TWEET LINKEDIN 4 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nIn her first comments to a reporter since the publication of her book, “Breaking Cardinal Rules,” Katina Powell said in a brief interview Friday that her daughters support the book in which she claims she provided them as escorts for University of Louisville players and recruits. \nSpeaking at the front door of her apartment in Smoketown, Powell, who alleges in the book that she took University of Louisville basketball tickets as well as cash for supplying escorts to recruits and players, said “it doesn’t really matter anymore” if she is a U of L fan. \nPowell declined an offer to answer additional questions about the book, saying it is already being publicized through other means. \nPrior to publication, Powell told a reporter for Indianapolis Business Journal, part of the company that published the book, that she was not currently working. “I have three brand-new grandchildren,” she was quoted. “With the grandchildren, the kids and the book, I’ve just been thrown a little off track.\" \nPowell lives in a Louisville Metro Housing Authority scattered-site unit on South Shelby Street. The maximum gross income for the occupants of a one bedroom apartment is $39,550 a year. But the amount goes up with each additional bedroom, according to Tim Barry, the agency’s executive director. He said he couldn’t address the status of individual tenants. Terrence Williams: 'I am not part of that' \nPowell incorporated a transportation company last year she said was designed to give rides to shift workers in the West End, but it was dissolved when she failed to file an annual report this year, according to state records. \nShe writes in the book that she had worked recently for a service that cleans bedrooms, baths and kitchens in dorms at U of L, and for an Atlanta-based restoration company. Both confirmed her employment but said it was brief. \nPowell said in the book that her two younger daughters were 15 and 17 when she allegedly began supplying them and other women to entertain prospects and players, which prompted Commonwealth’s Attorney Tom Wine to say she could be prosecuted if there was corroborating evidence that they were underage at the time. \nAttorney Larry Wilder, who says he is representing Powell, said this week that Powell’s daughters were not underage when they engaged in illegal activities. \nThe daughters, who are approximately 20, 22 and 24 now, could not be reached for comment. Father sickened by Powell, daughter's role \nMen’s basketball coach Rick Pitino has denied any knowledge of the book’s allegations that Powell provided escorts for 22 parties at Minardi Hall over four years, in exchange for $10,000 and tickets she alleges she received from then-director of operations Andre McGee. \nAt the annual Basketball Tipoff Luncheon Tuesday, Pitino the claims in the book “hit us all like a bombshell” and that “if there was any wrongdoing – that's a big 'if' – then people have to pay for their crimes. And that's an 'if.' If it happens, we will own up to it and do the best we can under adverse situations.\" \n“Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen,” was published online Oct. 2 by First Edition Design Publishing and is ranked 3,081 among all books available on the Amazon Kindle.
