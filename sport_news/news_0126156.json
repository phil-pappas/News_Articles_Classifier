Bret Bielema is a character and everybody can agree on that. But his recent transgressions may have crossed the line, many believe.\nAdChoices This past weekend against Alabama, Bielema pulled a sketchy move after Razorbacks defensive end Hjalte Froholdt and Crimson Tide offensive lineman Cam Robinson dragged each other out of bounds near Arkansas’ sideline. While Robinson was being separated from the sideline by referee, Bielema stepped in and appeared to flop as if Robinson pushed him . It drew a flag and led to Bielema celebrating with a little dance. If it was what it appeared to be, it’s quite the dirty move, and SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey had to make a statement on the incident .\nAmid the backlash, Bielema had an interesting Quote: for his critics, passed along by Sports Talk’s Bo Mattingly .\nBielema on the criticism: \"Bring it on, baby. It just is what it is when you’re 2-4. It’s a world full of hate.\"\n— Bo Mattingly (@SportsTalkwBo) October 13, 2015\nThis probably won’t be the last time we hear from Bielema.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "https://twitter.com/SportsTalkwBo/status/654060914019143680", "https://twitter.com/SportsTalkwBo", "http://collegespun.com/sec/arkansas/arkansas-coach-bret-bielema-pulls-questionable-move-during-alabama-game", "http://collegespun.com/sec/arkansas/arkansas-razorbacks-football-alabama-crimson-tide-sec-commissioner-greg-sankey-bret-bielema-flop-cam-robinson-hjalte-froholdt-no-punishment-statement", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:48:37.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
