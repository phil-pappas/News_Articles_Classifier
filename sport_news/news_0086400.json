Krzyzewski, Duke's coach, has led the Americans since 2005, guiding them to consecutive Olympic gold medals, two world titles and a 75-1 record. \nDerrick Rose made his preseason debut, playing just over 10 minutes, in the Chicago Bulls' 103-102 victory over the Dallas Mavericks in Lincoln, Nebraska. Rose had eight points on 4-of-6 shooting. He had been sidelined since fracturing his left orbital bone Sept. 29. Motor sports Matt Kenseth hasn't softened his stance toward Joey Logano after their incident at Kansas Speedway last weekend. Kenseth was racing for a win he needed to advance into the third round of NASCAR's playoffs when contact from behind from Logano caused him to spin. \nLogano went on to win the race and maintained it was accidental contact, a product of hard racing.

He's too good a race car driver to do that by accident.\" \nKenseth is now last in the 12-driver field headed into Sunday's race at Talladega, after which four drivers will be cut from the field. \nNico Rosberg turned in the fastest lap during the wet but still drivable morning session for the United States Grand Prix with a time of 1 minute, 53.989 seconds before torrential rain and lighting in Austin, Texas, forced race officials to cancel the afternoon practice session. MMA The UFC reinstated former light heavyweight champion Jon Jones, lifting his indefinite suspension after its lawyers reviewed his plea agreement stemming from a hit-and-run crash in Albuquerque in April. \nUFC President Dana White has previously said Jones likely would get an immediate title shot against Daniel Cormier, who claimed the light heavyweight belt after Jones' ban. \nJones pleaded guilty last month to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident involving injury. He will serve up to 18 months of supervised probation. Miscellany The former president of the German football federation has accused his successor of lying, saying there was a slush fund used in Germany's successful 2006 World Cup bid. Theo Zwanziger told Der Spiegel weekly that his successor Wolfgang Niersbach must have known about the secret money for years. \nLindsey Vonn will skip Saturday's first race of the Alpine skiing season as she doesn't feel confident about the icy conditions on the race hill in Soelden, Austria, 10 weeks after fracturing an ankle bone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:59:48.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
