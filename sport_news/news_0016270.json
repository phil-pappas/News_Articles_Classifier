More >> \n(RNN) - And so we reach the midpoint of the college football season, when the pitiless fire of truth rains down on the undeserving, purging the unworthy. \nIt's been said the SEC football season is like a double-elimination tournament - you can lose one and hope for the best, but when the second shoe drops, start looking for late December hotel rooms in Orlando, Atlanta, Charlotte, Nashville and beyond. \nBy Saturday night, either LSU or Florida will have one loss. We'll know if Texas A&M has for all intents eliminated Alabama from championship contention or if the Aggies have joined the one-loss club. We'll also know whose fans are more disappointed: Georgia's or Missouri's. \nOle Miss' title hopes don't rest on beating Memphis, but a loss would hurt the league's reputation. That would be catastrophic in this day and age, with the playoff system and all the national media heaping love on conferences that are not the SEC. \nLSU, 5-0, is the highest-ranked team in the league now, at sixth. Inconceivable! La. Tech at Mississippi State Noon, SECN \nLouisiana Tech comes to Starkville quarterbacked by Jeff Driskel, who might sort of wish he was back at Florida, given current circumstances in Gainesville. \nActually, not. \nMississippi State seems to have once again become the team that beats the teams it's supposed to beat and loses to the teams it shouldn't. \nLouisiana Tech is one of the teams they should beat. Ole Miss at Memphis Noon ET, ABC \nMississippi is a 10-point favorite, but to keep things interesting, let’s put the Rebels on upset alert, anyway. \nThe Tigers are playing at home, they are 5-0 and have played decent if not overwhelming competition, and they pour out points like an oil tanker with a ruptured hull. \nOle Miss looked vulnerable two weeks ago while getting crushed by Florida. But, let's face it, Florida’s defense is excellent, and it was a road game in the SEC, neither of which is the case against Memphis. \nOle Miss has a great defense, the late unpleasantness in Gainesville notwithstanding. They’re allowing only 337 yards and 20 points per game. The offense can score as fast as Memphis ever dreamed. \nBut the Tigers' Paxton Lynch is a sound quarterback, who gives his team a puncher’s chance. If he can keep from accidentally throwing it to Rebels and can throw well enough to open up the run, Memphis could get its first win in eight years. \nProbably not, but believe it and you'll enjoy the game more. Alabama at Texas A&M 3:30 p.m. ET, CBS \nAlabama’s playing another road game it must win, and Texas A&M is thought by many to be the best team in the SEC. This is the turning point for both teams. \nThe Crimson Tide is not a real hard team to figure out – if the breathtaking defense can stop, or even slow the Aggie’s offense, and if quarterback Jake Coker has a good game, they win. Both things have to happen to beat A&M. \nGambling logic predicts a close, close game. \nThe Tide is a 3-point favorite and the last eight times they were favored by 7 or fewer points they covered just twice, pushed once and lost three straight up. \nThis week's line dropped a point since it opened, which means a massive amount of cash came on Texas A&M in about three days. Probably because A&M has covered four out of the last five games and maybe because some wise guy with a fat wallet thinks he knows something. \nThe Aggies are coming off a bye week, while Alabama had to come from behind to beat Arkansas in a physical game last week. Since Nick Saban took over at Alabama in 2007, ESPN.com tells us the Tide has played 25 games against teams that had a bye week and Alabama didn't, That's 10 more than any other team in the nation. \nAlabama fans might want to write all seven congressmen and both senators and demand a congressional select committee headed by Trey Gowd y. \nSophomore Kyle Allen is the most efficient quarterback in the SEC, and you can make a case that he’s the best, period: 64 percent completion rate, 1,270 passing yards, 13 TDs and only two interceptions. He is a mobile quarterback who runs the kind of offense that has always given Alabama fits (See: Miss, Ole 2015). He owes Bama a debt of gratitude in a backhanded way - he took over as signal-caller from the embattled Kenny Hill after that hideous 59-0 beatdown in Tuscaloosa last year. \nAllen needs to throw a lot and throw well, because so far there has been living to be made running against Alabama. But Tra Carson is a good power runner who can get yards when he has to. \nPower stat: The Aggies are giving up 4.6 yards per rush; Bama is allowing 2.6. Maybe all Coker has to do is hand off to Derrick Henry and Kenyan Drake all day. Rest assured, this will happen plenty. \nNote: Alabama was a 1-point underdog earlier this year against Georgia, and won 38-10. \nConclusion: Do not bet on this, or any other college football game for the rest of your life. Vandy at South Carolina 4 p.m. SECN \nSteve Spurrier up and quit this week, leaving South Carolina interim coach Shawn Elliott a winnable game to start whatever semblance of a turnaround might be possible at this late date. \nVanderbilt was a 7-point underdog to open, which dropped to 3 after Spur hung up his spurs. That’s a bunch, but you know, who knows why or what it means, really? \nThe departure of the Head Ball Coach Emeritus has led to speculation that's more interesting than the game. \nUtah’s Kyle Whittingham is the favorite to take over as head coach at +350. You can get a line on the Eagles’ embattled Chip Kelly, Boise State’s Brian Harsin, Tom Herman, the new head coach at Houston and the greatly missed former offensive coordinator at sputtering Ohio State, Justin Fuente of Memphis… the list goes on. \nBefore you put down a buck with an off-shore online betting joint, talk to anybody who loaded up on Mike Gundy, the favorite to take over at Florida last year. Florida at LSU 9 p.m. ESPN \nAs South Carolina goes forward with a heavy heart, Florida, too, will have an absent friend when it heads into Death Valley to play Leonard Stomp University (LSU). \nWill Grier took a performance-enhancing something he should have left alone and got a calendar-year suspension that’s under appeal. That leave the quarterbacking in the hands of Treon Harris. Things could be worse. He’s a good hand with fast feet. \nI tweeted to famous astronomer and American science genius Neil deGrasse Tyson earlier this week, asking if Leonard Fournette ran into a black hole, would he be the only force in the universe that would come out the other side? \nThe lack of a response leads me to believe Tyson is still working on the math. \nThe game will hinge on whether Leonard can come out the other side of Florida’s very good defensive front. You have to like his chances. Missouri at Georgia, 7:30 p.m., SECN \nThe Going Down for the Third Time Bowl, live from Athens. \nMissouri has lost two SEC games to Kentucky and Florida. Georgia has lost its last two to Alabama and Tennessee. \nThese are trying times for both teams, who are playing for pride and the very real possibility that a team with two or three losses could win the dumpster-train-fire-wreck that is the SEC East Division. \nCopyright 2015 Raycom News Network.
