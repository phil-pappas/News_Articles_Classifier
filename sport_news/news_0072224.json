He's very professional, and he feels challenged to improve when things don't go well,\" Shurmur said. \nOn Monday, Eagles coach Chip Kelly said of Kelce: \"In the last two games, he's played at a really high level.\" \nKelce, who turns 28 next month, made the Pro Bowl last season for the first time. He is the fulcrum and the leader of the o-line group, and he has taken a lot of blame on himself for the group's struggles this season. \nWhat's he doing differently now? Mostly, embracing the advice of Kelly, Shurmur and offensive-line coach Jeff Stoutland to stop overthinking, Kelce said after Sunday's game. \n\"The mind is a dangerous thing,\" Shurmur said yesterday, when asked about Kelce's assertion. \"I think you've just got to go play sometimes. This is a game for P.E. majors, now: We've got to be aggressive, got to go . . . You've just got to go play . . . go right or go left or whatever you're going to do, and block the guy that shows. I think sometimes that's what we need to do more.\" \nThe Eagles' offensive line has faced a lot of stunting, angling and games from defenses this season. Kelce and his linemates have gotten confused, or tried to think through contingencies when a situation wasn't exactly like they practiced it, instead of just reacting and doing the simplest thing. \n\"We didn't try to overcomplicate it\" against the Saints, Kelce said yesterday. \"We ran a lot of plays that were very familiar for us. I think everybody had the mindset going in not to overthink it, not to worry about the guy to the right or left of you, just go out there and do your job and do what you're supposed to do, and it should take care of itself.\" \nSpeaking to Shurmur's point, maybe Kelce's problem was that he got a degree in marketing at Cincinnati, instead of P.E.? \n\"I don't know how smart you have to be to be a marketing major,\" Kelce said. \nBut you do have to communicate well with the rest of the line to be an effective center in the Eagles' scheme, and that is an area that seems to be improving. \n\"I think when Kelce's on it and he's playing well, communication's there and everyone's clear on what's going on, and executions's better,\" left guard Allen Barbre said. \"He's kind of like the quarterback of the offensive line.\" \nJohnson said: \"He had a great week this week, especially on some of the outside zones, going up to the 'backer, cutting him, cutting at the second level. Just from a communication standpoint, I thought we were a lot better.\" \nThe Eagles' attempts at man blocking were more successful than they'd been against other teams this season. \n\"This was the first game that man-blocking has really worked for us, pretty much every time we called it, except for once, when they did get penetration, in the first half,\" said Kelce, who noted that Dallas got a lot of penetration when the Eagles tried that tactic. \n\"We ran a lot of man-block plays where we were, block down, block down, (then) pull-around sweep plays that were very effective, and it takes a lot of coordination,\" Shurmur said. \"Our zone game was going well, also.\" \nJohnson said the way the Saints bit on play-action rollouts helped loosen up the later inside runs. \n\"I think the first two years (of Kelly's offense), people have seen pretty much everything we do, but over the past couple weeks, we started putting in some different stuff,\" Johnson said. \"We've got even more stuff coming this week, some different screens, stuff like that.\" \nIt might have helped that the Saints went into the game ranked 27th against the run. Monday night's matchup doesn't figure to be as easy; the Giants rank second against the run. \n\"(New Orleans) ran a few games every now and then, but nothing like we saw from the Cowboys or the Redskins,\" Johnson said. \"I expect the Giants may try to do what the Cowboys or the Redskins do. Me and J.P. did a lot of jump-setting on the (Saints') d-ends. When I did that on the jet sweep against the Redskins, as soon as they saw me open my hips to go jump, they tried to come inside. I expect the same thing from the Giants this week.\" \nShurmur said the Giants' defense \"is probably textbook team defense when it comes to stopping the run. They are very gap-sound . . . their linebackers are really good at their run fits. So what appears to be an open gap, they get down in quickly.\" \nKelce acknowledged the tougher challenge, but said: \"As long as we do what we did last week - everybody just block your man, do your job - I think that we can be successful against anybody.\" \nOf course, they still have their hanging Kelce good-luck charm going for them. Though Johnson is thinking of making alterations, in light of the haircut Kelce got before the New Orleans game. \n\"I'm going to end up cutting off that ponytail,\" Johnson said, fingering the brown fabric appendage sewn onto the Kelce doll's head. \"Since he doesn't have it anymore.\" \nOn Twitter: @LesBowen", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:53:25.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
