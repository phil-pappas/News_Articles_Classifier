FIELD HOCKEY: Friend's hat trick lifts Oliver Ames over Stoughton Senior Hannah Friend scored three goals to pace Oliver Ames past Stoughton. Comment By Greg Dudek Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 3:36 am Updated at 8:31 AM EASTON – The Oliver Ames High field hockey team turned to its Friend to get the job done on Thursday. Senior Hannah Friend guided the Tigers against Hockomock League rival Stoughton, notching a hat trick to help take down the Black Knights, 4-1, at Valentine P. Muscato Stadium. “Hannah is our go-to girl,” said Oliver Ames head coach Janice Sundell. “She’s been a starter since freshman year. She’s a talented player. She’s been a Hockomock League all-star and one of our high goal scorers every year. She does a lot for us, stays in the whole game and puts it in the net. She’s got a real knack (for scoring). She has a drive for the ball. She’s persistent in her play.” After 10 minutes of scoreless play to begin the contest, Oliver Ames (7-4-1, 7-4-1 Hockomock) got on the board when Friend put home a rebound to give the Tigers the lead, 1-0, with 19:54 to go in the first half. Scoring off a second chance became a theme for Oliver Ames as, later in the frame, Stoughton’s Kara Ploss (four saves) made the initial stop on a Friend shot, but Carly Cidado was right in front to knock the ball into the net for a 2-0 advantage with 14:10 remaining in the stanza. With the pressure continuing on the Black Knights’ defense, it yielded a corner and the Tigers took full advantage of it. Friend scored her second goal of the game off the corner, taking a pass from Nadia Eldemery, and depositing a shot into the back of the net for a 3-0 lead with 8:20 left in the opening half. “When you can get a rebound off a corner, that’s exactly what you want,” Sundell said. “You got numbers up, you should be scoring. That’s awesome when that happens.” Stoughton (7-5-2, 5-4-2) bounced back 1:52 later to cut into the deficit, 3-1, with junior forward Mia Russell scoring off an assist from junior Olivia Schlehuber. For a majority of the second half, the Black Knights were unable to get many scoring chances due to the Tigers maintaining possession on Stoughton’s side of the field. “We weren’t aggressive enough at all,” said Stoughton head coach Dan Mark. “You can’t have kids that are that good and back off of them. You got to play aggressively on them. We work on that all the time and they just didn’t do that today.” The consistent offensive attack from the Tigers wore down the Black Knights late in the second half, as Friend completed her hat trick with 11:46 left in regulation. With Oliver Ames dictating play and receiving strong performances from Dimitra Efremidis, Nicole Walker and Missy Krim along with defender Katie Davenport and senior goalie and captain Cassie Gavin (four saves), the lead was never in jeopardy. The win pushed the Tigers to the brink of earning a postseason berth as they are now only one point shy of qualifying. “Our mids really controlled the play today and the offense was able to get free,” Sundell said. “I think that’s how we could kind of dominate the game.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:32:39.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
