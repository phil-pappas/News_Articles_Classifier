Offensive coordinator Clay Helton was appointed interim coach. \nUSC hasn't elaborated on Sarkisian's problems, but the second-year coach had an embarrassing public display in August at a pep rally where he appeared to be intoxicated. USC head coach Steve Sarkisian yells at a referee in the fourth quarter of a 17-12 loss against Washington at the Los Angeles Coliseum on Thursday, Oct. 8, 2015, in Los Angeles. (Wally Skalij/Los Angeles Times/TNS) ( Wally Skalij ) \nSarkisian's unsteady appearance Sunday prompted Haden to make the program's fourth coaching change in just over two years. Haden has faced criticism for not acting more swiftly, especially after Sarkisian acknowledged mixing alcohol with medication before the \"Salute to Troy\" pep rally in August. Sarkisian later apologized and promised not to drink again during the season. \nTodd Marinovich, a former USC quarterback who has publicly battled heroin addiction, attended that gathering and said he warned university officials Sarkisian needed help. \n\"I knew he was intoxicated, and I wanted to protect him,\" Marinovich told HuffPost Live. \"And I went to the people in charge and I said, 'We've got to stop this.' \" Advertisement \nFormer USC coach Pete Carroll, who first brought Sarkisian to the team's coaching staff as a young assistant in 2001, said his protege now understands the gravity of the situation. \n\"He's going to do something about it, so this is the day the turn occurs,\" Carroll, now coach of the Seattle Seahawks, told a radio station in Seattle. \"This is going to take a long time. This is a big battle.\" \nSarkisian spent five years as Washington's head coach until 2013, when he left the Huskies for a reported five-year contract to return to USC. He went 12-6 as Trojans head coach. \nSarkisian spent one season as the Raiders' quarterbacks coach, in 2004. \nSarkisian never faced significant public scrutiny for alcohol use in Seattle, although his enthusiasm for nights out became part of his identity among fans and boosters. \nOne former Huskies player said he smelled alcohol on Sarkisian at team meetings, an allegation that bears some resemblance to reports by USC players that their coach \"didn't seem right\" during a meeting Sunday morning, and statements by others close to the Trojans football program that he seemed unstable during a recent game at Arizona State. \nThe Los Angeles Times interviewed more than two dozen people knowledgeable about Sarkisian's time at Washington and reviewed hundreds of pages of documents. It uncovered a portrait of a man who favored Patron Silver tequila or Coors Light and frequented Seattle-area bars, typically accompanied by staff members, and didn't hesitate to drink -- early -- while traveling. \nDuring a stop at a rib joint in Nashville in January 2013, for example, Sarkisian and three assistants ordered four shots of Patron Silver, four shots of an unspecified liquor and five beers. The coach cashed out at 11:53 a.m. \nSarkisian's use of alcohol became a running joke among some Washington players, some of whom spoke about the topic on the condition they not be named because of the personal nature of the issue. \nOne ex-player said that in 2009, Sarkisian's first season with the Huskies, the coach sometimes arrived at morning team meetings \"smelling like booze and with eyes all red, like he's been on a bender.\" \nTwo other former players said Sarkisian and other coaches regularly consumed alcohol in offices -- one said the coach typically kept an 18-pack of Coors Light stashed near his desk -- and that he appeared uncharacteristically loud and unsteady on some team flights. \nMore than 800 pages of receipts, hotel folios and expense reports obtained by The Times from Sarkisian's tenure at Washington show alcohol was a constant presence. \nIn 2011, for example, Sarkisian picked up a bill at Suncadia Resort in Cle Elum, Washington, that included 83 beers and 12 shots of Grey Goose vodka. Twenty Washington coaches and their spouses are listed as attending. \nDuring a one-night stay at the JW Marriott at L.A. Live in May 2011 for a speaking engagement, Sarkisian's hotel folio shows room service delivered a $90 bottle of Veuve Clicquot champagne, then six beers. \nAt the Arizona Biltmore in Phoenix for a Pac-12 Conference head coach meetings, Sarkisian ran up $106 in minibar charges in one day in May 2012 and spent more than $1,600 over two days at the Renaissance Indian Wells Resort and Spa's pool bar in 2013. \nTwo receipts from Washington retreats in Indian Wells in 2012 and 2013 showed Sarkisian expensed $1,023 worth of alcohol at a restaurant. That included 91 shots of tequila, much of it Patron Silver. At least 16 people attended one of the gatherings; the attendance for the other wasn't clear. \nHaden said USC vetted Sarkisian extensively before hiring him as head coach. \nSarkisian, 41, is in the midst of a divorce from his wife, Stephanie, and he recently sold a palatial house south of Los Angeles.
