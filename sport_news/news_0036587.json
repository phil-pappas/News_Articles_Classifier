One of the team leaders, Johnson plans on sticking around while William Powell steps into the starting running back job.\n\"Most guys when they get hurt, they go home,\" said Johnson, who had 448 yards rushing on 97 carries and 42 catches for 267 yards -- many of them after the RedBlacks released Chevon Walker.\n\"These guys look up to me for encouragement. I'm going to stay around, keep my face in here, keep smiling for these guys and let them know that I'm all right and they need to continue to do well. I'm always happy to get my guys up and get them going.\"\nJohnson, tied for the CFL lead in touchdowns -- with nine -- went down late in the first half against Toronto.\n\"I looked at it on film,\" he said. \"I was trying to get extra yards, a big D lineman jumped on my back while my foot was already dug into the turf. It felt a little weird, I tried to get up, it just wouldn't happen.\"\nWhat was he thinking when it happened? Was he angry, disappointed, sad?\nSaid the 28-year-old Johnson: \"It was more, 'Why?' I had a good season going on. I was itching to help my team in this playoff push. Things happen for a reason. God has a plan.\"\nSo far there's no surgery planned, with the team hoping he's ready to go for next year's training camp.\n\"We're looking at tests and trying to figure out what we need to do to fix it,\" said Johnson. \"There's no timeline. Everything's up in the air.\"\nPowell was very good against the Argos -- rushing seven times for 49 yards, with seven catches for 56 yards.\n\"We're disappointed to lose Jeremiah; he's done a lot of good things for us this year,\" said RedBlacks coach Rick Campbell. \"At the same time, it's the next man up. William Powell has a lot of the same skillset that Jeremiah does -- he's a similar type and if he keeps playing the way he's playing, I don't think we'll miss a beat.\"\n\"It's up to the next man to step up and capitalize on the opportunity,\" said Powell, who got significant playing time for the Arizona Cardinals as a running back and kick returner in 2012. \"I'm very confident in what I can do. I feel like I can bring a lot so we don't have to take a step back in Jeremiah's absence. We can keep this thing rolling and make a push.\"\nA DUNN DEAL\nWith Powell's promotion to starting running back, the RedBlacks will look at other options as their kickoff returner. Reggie Dunn was back there on Monday. Dunn, who was added to the RedBlacks' practice roster two weeks ago, certainly has some eye-popping video to prove he's a good returner. In 2012, he returned four kickoffs for touchdowns and in his NCAA career with the Utah Utes, he had five kickoff returns of more than 100 yards for TDs, two in one game. \"We're going to take a look at him these next couple of days,\" said Campbell. \"He's very fast so we want to get him a look -- him and (Travon) Van, who's been back there are well. Both those guys are possibilities.\"\nANOTHER KICKER\nRonnie Pfeffer is once again the RedBlacks punter after the team cut Brett Maher last Wednesday. Before getting moved to the six-game injured list when Maher was brought in, Pfeffer averaged 41.5 yards per punt. The team has other in-roster options. Backup QB Thomas DeMarco was working on his punting after practice on Monday. There's another interesting option. Powell, was a punter/kicker in high school. He's also got a soccer background; he started playing when he was four.\nHENRY A-OK\nThere was good news, maybe warranting a big sigh of relief for RedBlacks fans, on Monday. Quarterback Henry Burris, who left the game against Toronto last Tuesday with what looked like an injury to his throwing shoulder, looked good in practice. \"Henry's good to go, he shows no ill effects of anything -- he's full speed to go,\" said Campbell.\nSTRIPES AND GRIPES\nWhile there has been plenty of talk about questionable officiating against the Argos last week (and, yes, for sure they blew some calls), Campbell wasn't airing any beefs: \"We really don't worry about that,\" he said. \"We have enough issues ourselves. We just want to play good football. The refs want to be good refs. Everybody wants to be on top of their game.\"\nBOMBERS AWAY\nThe Winnipeg Blue Bombers, who play Ottawa Friday night at TD Place, got a huge win on Saturday, beating the B.C. Lions 29-26 to put themselves in the middle of the playoff picture with five wins. \"They played an inspired game in B.C,\" said Campbell. \"You could tell it was important to them. From here on out, it's going to be desperate football for everybody so you have to show up and be your best.\"\nTwitter: @ TimCBaines\nSnapshots\nRedBlacks' RB Jeremiah Johnson taking leadership role to heart\nBy Tim Baines , Ottawa Sun First posted: Monday, October 12, 2015 04:00 PM EDT | Updated: Monday, October 12, 2015 05:54 PM EDT\nJeremiah Johnson stood on crutches at midfield following Monday's practice, the first time the Ottawa RedBlacks had been on a football field since last Tuesday's 38-35 loss to the Toronto Argos.\nJohnson's season is over ... \"I'm done,\" he told reporters Monday ... but he's not abandoning ship.
