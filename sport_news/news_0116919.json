The Blue Raiders sit at 3-4 overall and 2-1 in Conference USA. \n\"I believe that anything is possible if you put your mind to it,” Johnson said. “I believe in this team and every player on this team and I feel like we can win out and that we will win out. We just have to continue with the mission.\" \nThe Blue Raiders travel to Ruston, La., for yet another challenge before their first bye week of the season. \nLouisiana Tech sits atop the Conference USA West division with and ranks third behind MTSU in the league when it comes to scoring offense (37.3 points per game). The Bulldogs also bring in the top rushing defense in the conference. \n\"Every game from here on out is a must-win game,” safety Kevin Byard said emphatically at Monday’s press conference. “As far as the championship we're going to need some help. It's definitely not in our control as of right now. But we're just worried about the next game and playing hard to win that next game.” \nFollowing Saturday’s win over Florida International, MTSU moved into third place in the East behind Western Kentucky and Marshall. \n“We're not looking at the standings, but if we keep doing the things we're supposed to be doing we'll look up at the end of the year and be right where we want to be,\" Byard said. \nAlthough both players and coach Rick Stockstill are focused on Louisiana Tech, they did not overlook the importance over the win over FIU after tough losses to Vanderbilt and Illinois. \n“The win is rewarding in the sense of how hard these guys have worked and competed the whole year, but especially the last three weeks,” Stockstill said. “(It speaks) to the resiliency, attitude and toughness of this team to prepare and fight in practice.” \nJohnson said the win was an important reminder to his team. \n\"It was a big deal to get back in the win column and to prove to us that we can still do it,” Johnson said. “But we have to keep on doing that and we will continue to do that. We have to continue to have that chip on our shoulder to be a tough hard-nosed team like Coach Stockstill tells us to be.\" \nReach Aldo Amato at 615-278-5109 and on Twitter @Aldo_ Amato \nNEXT GAME \nWhen: Oct. 24 (2:30 p.m.) \nWhere: Joe Aillet Stadium (Ruston, La.) \nSeries record: MTSU trails 1-3 \nTV: American Sports Network \nRadio 89.5 FM, 102.5 FM, 97.5 FM, 100.5 FM, 101.9 FM, 1450 AM \nNotable: The game will mark the third time the two schools have met since MTSU moved to the FBS and the first since 2000.
