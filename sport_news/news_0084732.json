Sheik Salman will now be seen as the favourite for the president \nBut with support in Europe drifting away from Platini following a police investigation into a disputed Â£1.35m payment from Sepp Blatter, Salman has resolved to stand after weeks of deliberation. \nHis candidacy emerged after a day of fractious discussion among European football leaders at UEFA headquarters in Nyon ended with the only a lukewarm expression of support for Platini.

Holland's Michael Van Praag, a candidate in May's election, is thought to be considering his position. \nSheikh Salman's major contribution to FIFA since his elevation to the executive committee was to lead the group that negotiated the shifting of the 2022 Qatar World Cup from summer to winter. \nAn unpopular project, it doubtless proved a crash course in the machinations of FIFA politics. It is a world with which he is about to become a great deal more familiar.
