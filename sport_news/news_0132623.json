Smart, big plays on offense. Turnovers. Defensive touchdowns. It all added up to type of Seattle Seahawks game we are used to seeing from this team with one exception. \nThey forgot that they are supposed to play four quarters, not three. \nThat failure cost Seattle the victory as they fall to the Bengals in overtime 27-24. \nIt’s going to be a tough road for the Hawks now to get back to the playoffs, let alone the Super Bowl with play like that from both sides of the ball late in games. Here are my takeaways from the game. Kearse had a nice TD grab to tie the game early. What I Liked \nIn the first quarter, Russell Wilson did a brilliant job of recognizing the blitz. He checked his play at the line and hit Jermaine Kearse for a huge TD that tied the game early. I’ve been tough on Wilson this year about blitz reads so this was good to see and he wasn’t done being good in this situation either. \nWe saw the same kind of recognition from Wilson in the 3 rd quarter. The Bengals brought the house blitz and Wilson was able to loft one for Doug Baldwin that went for 40+ yards. This is the smart, heady type of play the Seahawks need from Wilson consistently. \nThomas Rawls did a nice job filling in for the injured Marshawn Lynch . He ran with the same type of tenacity we are used to seeing from Beast Mode. He’s not as big or as strong but the results were every bit as good. The run he made in the 3 rd quarter for a touchdown was every bit as much Beast Mode as anything Lynch has done. \nThe Seahawks finally got off the interception-less list. Earl Thomas made a nice pick in the end zone that took at least three points away from the Bengals. He returned it 70+ yards but the return got negated by a penalty. Still, it was good to see the pressure on Dalton leading to turnovers. The LOB needed to get that aspect of their game going and they did. Bennett made great plays and cost the Seahawks points in this one \nAs bad as Michael Bennett ’s play to hit Dalton on that interception return was, no one can say he didn’t make up for it. Bennett came in unblocked and stripped the ball away from Burkhead. Bobby Wagner was able to pick it up and walk in for the easy Seahawks touchdown. That play is one that really brought back memories of the Seahawks defense of years past. What I Didn’t Like \nThe Seahawks secondary and linebackers struggled early on with communication on coverages. Dalton was able to take advantage and hit wide open receivers for easy big gains. This is a problem we have seen from the Seahawks this year and it doesn’t seem to be going away. \nEven after the communication issues were ironed out, Cary Williams really struggled in this game. Richard Sherman had to start shadowing AJ Green. That prompted Dalton to start throwing to other receivers but almost always to the guy being covered by Williams. Williams also got burned with two pass interference calls. \nI’m afraid that Bennett reverted back to his flag inducing ways in this one. He jumped offsides on a Dalton hard count AGAIN and had a cheap shot penalty during Thomas’s interception return that cost the Seahawks more than 50 yards of real estate. That penalty also cost the Seahawks a realistic shot at a touchdown before halftime and will also likely result in Bennett losing a stack of his cash as well. What I Really Didn’t Like \nLike I mentioned at the top, the Seahawks went to sleep in the 4 th quarter both offensively and defensively. That lapse led to overtime and the Seahawks loss. It might cost them a shot at the playoffs as well. \nThe personnel choices in over time were atrocious too, particularly on offense where Bevell opted for Jackson over a 169 yard performing Rawls. Also shown was a two tight end set with neither one of them named Jimmy Graham . I just don’t get that. Looking Ahead \nNext, the Seahawks hope to get back on track as they play hosts to Cam Newton and the Carolina Panthers. The Panthers have played hard against the Seahawks in recent matchups but the Seahawks have always come out on top and I expect they will again.
