And really, why should they? Niceville (5-1) still has to play Crestview (3-4) at Eagle Stadium, a venue that hosted the Bulldogs’ 17-12 up-set two years ago. And “The Game” still looms between crosstown rivals Choctaw (4-2) and Fort Walton Beach (1-5). Yet each 1-0 in district, Niceville trouncing the Vikings 55-6 and Choctaw rolling over Crestview 21-6, it’s hard to deny early talks of tonight's 7 p.m. tilt at Eagle Stadium being the de-facto district championship. Win and assume the district frontrunner status. Lose and, well, the playoff picture becomes murky with a trip to Jacksonville potentially looming against the District 4-6A champion. Or, worst-case scenario, no postseason at all. “That's the key,” said Hicks, whose Eagles have made the playoffs in all 14 of his years at the helm. “Not having to go to Jacksonville and play the best team from that district is pretty important.” “It seems like whenever we’re on the road in the playoffs, it’s a trip because we’re stuck on one end of Florida,” said Thomas, whose Indians lost 17-14 to Bartram Trail, 40 miles south of Jacksonville, two years ago in the Region 1-6A finals. “We’re happy if we’re in the playoffs, but we’d rather not make that trip if we don’t have to.” Yet right now, the 15-mile road trip to Eagle Stadium appears the most daunting of all. To wit: Niceville’s won 16 straight at Eagle Stadium since that loss to Crestview, which was later avenged in a three-team playoff. The scoring margin during that three-year stretch is more impressive: 673-218. Yep, that’s not a typo. The Eagles have celebrated six running-clock wins, three shutouts, and seven times have held the opponent to single digit points during that win streak. Meanwhile this year they’re 3-0 at home, winning by an average margin of 36-16. “Obviously we’re more in control there,” Hicks said. “We feed off that energy. But at the same time, we know a home game isn’t going to win it for us all by itself.” “It’s a great atmosphere,” Thomas added. “It’ll be packed and loud. Our players are excited for the challenge.” So what are the keys for each team? What will be the deciding factor in who assumes the District 3-6A reins? Niceville needs to let its playmakers shine Page 2 of 3 - Niceville running back Deonte’ Sheffield is getting the rock 27 times a game. Sure, it’s a high usage. But it’s also warranted considering his dual-threat talents. The 5-foot-10, 200-pound junior’s numbers are gaudy: 156 rushing yards per game and 14 touchdowns. Consistency has been the key, as he’s scored in all six games and has yet to be held under 100 yards. Meanwhile he’s hauled in 200 yards and three touchdowns. “He's having a great year,” Hicks said. “He can run between the tackles and has the size and power to be successful north to south. But he's also stepped up to be a perimeter guy who can hit the edges, so even if we don’t block just right he has the speed to hit those edges.” Choctaw has had success against the run this season. The Indians limited Navarre’s backfield – averaging 300 yards and nearly four scores per game – to 201 yards and just a single score, and they stifled Crestview’s rushing attack. Niceville, though, is no one-dimensional offense. Niceville quarterback Jeff Toney has completed 66 percent of his passes for 176 yards per game to accent 13 scores compared to one interception. He’s spelled by the accurate Tyler Russell, who has thrown for a pair of scores and is completing 68 percent of his passes. Their favorite target continues to be Auburn commitment Eli Stove, who has 312 yards of offense and five touchdowns since returning from an injury two weeks ago. “They have such explosive talent on the offensive side,” Thomas said. “We hope to keep that to a minimum. They move Eli around a lot so it’s hard to put one particular guy on him. It’s going to have to be a collective effort. Everybody’s going to have to do their job.” Choctaw needs a strong start In the last two years, the Indians have scored a combined 10 first-half points against Niceville. By start of the second half of both, running clocks were in play. So it’s easy to understand why Thomas believes a win is contingent on the offense. “We can’t turn it over like in years past,” he said. “We have to move the chains and keep their offense off the field, and we have to set the tone early.” The Jake Fairly-led option offense is averaging more than 32 points per game, and playmakers like running back Marquise Kane and receivers Richie Grant and Chris Pickett have emerged. “The thing that jumps out is the development of Fairly and how much better he’s gotten,” Hicks said. “He’s certainly become a more effective runner and he’s become a dual-threat guy. He ran all over Pine Forest and Rickards.” Page 3 of 3 - Added Thomas: “He’s done an outstanding job for us this year and we’re going to need for him to have another outstanding game. He has to keep the chains moving and not turn the ball over.” Choctaw has featured Pickett and Grant in the wildcat, and they’ll most certainly try to get the pair the ball in the open field. “They have really good team speed,” Hicks said. “They present a lot of challenges and we’re expecting for them to bring their best.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:22:30.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
