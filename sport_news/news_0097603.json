Saturday’s game marked the first time K-State had been shut out since a 12-0 loss at Colorado in 1996. The Wildcats also snapped a home scoring streak of 158 straight games, as it was last held scoreless at home on Oct. 26, 1991 by Colorado (10-0). It was the worst loss for K-State since a 63-0 rout at Oklahoma in 1974. \nSlinging blanks The Wildcats passed for only 45 yards — the fewest for a K-State team since throwing for 40 yards against Iowa State in 1992. \nStuffing the middle Sophomore defensive tackle Will Geary had a big day, collecting a career-high eight tackles to go along with two sacks of OU quarterback Baker Mayfield. \nHubener benched Joe Hubener had his day cut short after an ineffective first half. The junior, in fact, didn’t even make it the entire first half before he was benched in favor of receiver Kody Cook. Hubener, who did return in the fourth quarter, finished his day 4-of-14 passing for 39 yards with two interceptions, while also rushing 11 times for 16 yards. He was sacked twice. Cook wasn’t much better, completing just 1 of 8 passes for 6 yards and an interception. \nTotal yards K-State had just 110 yards of total offense on Saturday — 65 rushing and 45 passing — marking the fewest output for the Wildcats since 1996 when K-State had only 86 in a loss at Nebraska. \nInjury update Morgan Burns was back in action on Saturday, but Danzel McDaniel was inactive after leaving last week’s game early with an injury. True freshman Duke Shelley got the start for McDaniel. Elijah Lee left Saturday’s game in the second quarter after taking a hard hit to the shoulder and did not return. Safety Kaleb Prewett left the game in the second half with concussion symptoms and did not return. Dante Barnett, out since the first half of the season opener, remained inactive and on the sidelines in sweatpants. \nLate arrival Oklahoma had four mechanical issues with four different planes Friday afternoon in Oklahoma City, delaying its scheduled afternoon flight more than eight hours. The Sooners didn’t arrive in Manhattan on Friday until 11:42 p.m., causing the team to miss its scheduled walk-through. It didn’t seem to matter on Saturday. \nNext week The Wildcats travel to Austin, Texas, to face the Longhorns in an 11 a.m. kickoff on Fox Sports 1. \n— Joshua Kinder RELATED ARTICLE Snyder sees no ‘slump’ in QB Knight \nSome folks in Oklahoma believe Trevor Knight is slumping. Kansas State head coach Bill Snyder disagrees, wholeheartedly. \nBaker Mayfield lit up Kansas State’s defense for five touchdowns passes and the Oklahoma defense intercepted three passes as the Sooners made the Wildcats look lifeless on Saturday. \nK-State didn’t eclipse the 100-yard mark of total offense until the fourth quarter, while Oklahoma’s offense racked up 568 yards with relative ease in pitching the first shutout in Bill Snyder Family Stadium since 1991 — when Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops was coaching for the Wildcats. \nComing off a 24-17 loss at Texas where the offense wasn’t in sync and the defense gave up a few big plays, the Sooners were looking to turn it around on the road. \nThe mission to win in Manhattan got off to a poor start on Friday, as the Sooners left Norman, Okla., around 2 p.m. and didn’t get to their hotel until 12:15 a.m. after a series of issues with charter flights out of Oklahoma City. \nBut none of that seemed to bother Oklahoma once it hit the field as it fired on all cylinders on both sides of the ball to win its sixth consecutive game in Manhattan. \n“Very proud of our team and the way they played and responded,” Stoops said. “They had a great week of work. They came out Monday just really fired up, energetic, and it carried through the week. We executed really well. The execution was maybe as good as we had.” \nThe Sooners’ defense played with intensity all game, sacking K-State six times and notching 11 tackles for loss. Zack Sanchez picked off two passes, returning one for a 38-yard touchdown in the third quarter, and Thomas Jordan picked off another. \nOklahoma held the Wildcats to 65 rushing yards and 45 pass yards on 5-of-22 passing. \n“Tackling was really good,” Stoops said. “Our assignment responsibility was really good, and then in coverage we did a great job with the whole team.” \nThe Sooners started fast from the first drive, going 75 yards in five plays and scoring on a 22-yard pass from Mayfield to Sterling Shepard. \nAfter getting held to 278 yards a week ago, Oklahoma offensive coordinator Lincoln Riley said it felt like it set the tone for the whole game. \n“I think us getting down there pretty fast that first drive just gave energy to the whole team,” he said. “You could just feel it on the sideline. You felt great about the whole thing.” \nMayfield finished the game 20 of 27 for 282 yards, and threw all five of his touchdowns in the first half as Oklahoma built up a 35-0 lead by halftime. \n“Baker was strong,” Stoops said. “Baker threw the ball very well, scrambled for some big plays and had an excellent day.” \nThe Sooners flipped their script in the second half, keeping up their quick offensive pace but focusing more on the run. Oklahoma didn’t score a rushing touchdown until the fourth quarter, but more than half of its 232 rushing yards came in the second half, with Joe Mixon, Samaje Perine and Daniel Brooks all carrying the load. \nStoops said he was happy with the way his team responded to the adversity from a week ago, especially playing in what was a tough environment for at least half of the game. \n“Coming here to play in the great environment, I know things got out of hand and it changed the environment, but coming in I always appreciate the fans,” he said. “The student body, the way they’re going crazy, and the stadium, because I was here when it was not this. It’s such a great place to play.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:18:27.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
