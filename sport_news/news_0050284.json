Instead, the Jets fell to 4-2 behind the 6-0 Pats.\n\"We're fine,\" he said. \"We're fine. It's Week 7.\"\nMatched up with Julian Edelman at times, Revis pinpointed the Patriots wide receiver's 27-yard reception on third-and-17 in the fourth quarter with New England trailing, 20-16, as the turning point.\n\"We had them where we wanted them,\" said Revis, who wasn't matched up with Edelman on the catch. \"Third-and-17 and they made a play.\"\nHe added of his battles with Edelman, who caught five passes for 54 yards: \"No, it's fun, man. Any receiver I cover is fun to go up against, some of the top guys in the league. That's my job description, is to cover some of the greatest receivers in this game.\"\nOverall, Revis didn't give up any big plays, but the Jets, who benefitted from some drops by Patriots receivers, could not hold off Tom Brady in the fourth quarter, who threw touchdown passes to Danny Amendola and Rob Gronkowski to rally to victory.\n\"We tried to switch things up on Tom and show him different looks, but Tom is great,\" Revis said. \"He suckered us in the defense. That's what he did down the stretch.\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Jets+CB+Darrelle+Revis+keeps+loss+in+perspective"], "published": "2015-10-26T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:56:23.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
