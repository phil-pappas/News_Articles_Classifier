Staff photo by Matt Stone Tweet \nOn this morning's weekly appearance on the Dennis & Callahan on WEEI, Tom Brady reiterated his hope to play for 10 more years. \n\"I hope so, I hope so. There's a lot of things that can happen in football,\" Brady said. \n\"What else am I going to do?\" \nIt's the type of wish that not many quarterbacks aspire to, but Brady feels that the notion that he can't play at that age — and play at a high level — is not something that should be dictated to him. \n\"There's nothing like playing football. Football, it's a big challenge and it's a big commitment to make,\" said Brady, who is at the center of the MVP discussion this year at the age of 38. \"I think that's something that I'm excited about. There's nothing I love (more) than running out and playing football, and just because someone says, 'Well, you should stop playing at this age or this age because that's what people do before you,' I don't really buy that. I kind of want to make my own decisions. If the game's not fun anymore, which I highly doubt it, because it's fun for my parents ... they're in their 70s. It's fun for me, my kids, and it's just something I love to do.\" \nBrady acknowledged that a huge piece of that puzzle is playing in a Patriots organization that simply keeps winning every year. If the losses piled up, maybe the fire wouldn't be there as much. \n\"Absolutely, I think winning is the fun part, and being a part of this organization, there's no place I'd rather play,\" he said. \"You've got to win. You can't go 2-14 and expect people are going to want you back, either. I think you've just got to keep focusing on what your process has been and what I've tried to accomplish over the last several years of my career about sustaining my peak performance. Hopefully the player you see today is the player you see five years from now.\" \nPart of the challenge of playing as an older quarterback, he said, isn't just the physical side. As he approaches 40, Brady noted the amount of mental acuity it takes to keep up, too. \n\"I try to be critical of myself. I think I'm making all the throws I need to make,\" he said. \"There will always be things I can do better. I've worked hard always on my throwing mechanics. I've always worked hard on them. Playing quarterback is throwing the ball accurately, being able to make the throws and being durable and making good decisions. I try to take care of the decisions part. I try to take care of the accuracy part. I try to take care of the durability part. \n\"Then it comes down to leadership and relating to your teammates and different challenges you face as you get older. You play with guys that are 15 years younger than you, you've got to figure out ways to relate to them so you can still be a leader. Those things are different challenges you face as you get older.\" Authors", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T17:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:13:50.960+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
