Radio: WEEI 93.7-FM\nTHREE THINGS TO WATCH\n1. The BC offense must solve its red-zone issues with touchdowns, but the field-goal unit also needs to improve. The Eagles left six points on the field against Duke in a two-point loss, the result of a breakdown in the snap and a wobbly kick by freshman Colton Lichtenberg.\n2. Defensive coordinator Don Brown loves to befuddle inexperienced quarterbacks with confusing looks and innovative blitz packages. In last year’s 23-17 win at Wake, Brown applied both to freshman John Wolford. (Due to an ankle injury, Wake is expected to start true freshman Kendall Hinton in Wolford’s place.)\n3. BC has arguably the best front seven in college football, with a secondary that gives up fewer than 100 passing yards per game, but is way behind the curve on forced turnovers that would hand short fields to the struggling offense. The Eagles have three interceptions and two fumble recoveries in five games.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T21:23:40.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
