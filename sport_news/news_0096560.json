Who is No. 1? Where are the Arizona Cardinals? Last week's rankings in parenthesis. Follow Bob McManaman on Twitter @azbobbymac. Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports 32. (30) Jacksonville Jaguars: The Home Owners Association called again. They said no kittens allowed. Not in London, even. Pu . Logan Bowles-USA TODAY Sports 31. (29) Tennessee Titans: Will fall to 1-5 this Sunday after they host the Falcons. You can look it up. You know, after it happens. Christopher Hanewinckel-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 30. (26) Kansas City Chiefs: That’s five straight losses for the Chiefs, which is a good thing, really. No, think about it. They’ll be in a very good draft position to select their next real quarterback. You know, in another six months or so. Time is ticking. Brace Hemmelgarn-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 29. (24) Baltimore Ravens: Is it just me, or have the Ravens been incredibly average and boring since they won the Super Bowl a few years ago? No, it’s not me. It’s the 1-5 Ravens, who will lose again this Monday night. Guess who they’re playing? C’mon, guess. Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 28. (32) Detroit Lions: See Matthew Stafford get benched during a rout by the Cardinals. See Matthew Stafford respond by throwing four touchdown passes to beat the Bears in overtime for the Lions’ first win of the year. See if I care anymore. Just kidding, Detroit. No, seriously. Tim Fuller-USA TODAY Sports 27. (27) Tampa Bay Buccaneers: You didn’t play in Week 6 and you know what? I didn’t even miss you. Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 26. (31) San Francisco 49ers: No way. Colin Kaepernick passed for 340 yards and two touchdowns without an interception in a 25-20 victory over the Ravens? It’s true. Please tell me you have more of that in you, Kap, when you face your NFC West-rival Seahawks this Thursday night at home. Ed Szczepanski-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 25. (22) Washington Redskins: Hey, was that Robert Griffin III that I saw active last week during that 14-point loss to the Jets? It was, but it was only because Washington needed all those inactive spots for their litany of injured players. Get well this week at home against the Buccaneers. Dale Zanine-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 24. (20) Chicago Bears: I’ll give these guys credit because they should have taken care of business on the road this past Sunday in Detroit and I thought they did – you know, until I saw that “touchdown” by the Lions’ Golden Tate. Sit this one out this week and we’ll talk. Tim Fuller-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 23. (28) Miami Dolphins: They squashed the three-game losing skid in Dan Campbell's NFL head coaching debut and in the process, they squashed Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota with a dangerously-low cheap shot to the knees. Not cool, Olivier Vernon. Not cool at all. Christopher Hanewinckel-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 22. (25) Houston Texans: Injuries are hitting this team hard right now and at 2-4, well, that’s not good. They beat the Jaguars by 11 this past week, though. Can they beat the Dolphins in Miami? Wait, let me flip a coin. … Uh, heads says no. Logan Bowles-USA TODAY Sports 21. (21) Dallas Cowboys: Judging from what I watched Monday night from the Giants, I have every reason to believe you can win this week, Matt Cassel and the Cowboys. Can Dez Bryant come out and play yet? Timothy T. Ludwig-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 20. (23) New Orleans Saints: Dispatched the previously unbeaten Falcons last Thursday night, which seemed like, well, five days ago, I suppose. Could it be that the Saints might actually make my preseason prediction come true and find the moxie to win enough games to clinch the NFC South? Nah, probably not. Derick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 19. (19) Cleveland Browns: How can you possibly move the Brownies down at all after they almost came up with a huge upset over the Broncos? You can’t, even though they lost to Denver in overtime. Don’t worry, Cleveland. You’ll lose this week in St. Louis. In regulation time. Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 18. (13) Seattle Seahawks: Yes, the two-time defending NFC champions really are 2-4 after six games. Yes, I would thoroughly expect them to beat the pants of the 49ers in San Francisco this Thursday night. Not that we need to see anybody going pants-less or anything, of course. Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 17. (14) Buffalo Bills: E.J. Manuel did what he could do and hey, you have to love the gutsy effort LeSean McCoy gave despite dealing with a nagging hamstring injury. It wasn’t enough to stop the red-hot Bengals, but let’s at least applaud the effort. Kevin Hoffman-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 16. (16) Oakland Raiders: You know the rules here – if you don’t play the week before, I almost always never move a team up or down. Rule applies to the Raiders, too, and hey, I actually like this team for once. Maybe even on the road at the Chargers. As far as you know. Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 15. (15) St. Louis Rams: Again, no change because they didn’t play on Sunday. Common sense would tell me the Rams will get to 3-3 this week because they play the Browns. Problem is, it’s in Cleveland and that’s almost a wash. Time methinks for Todd Gurley to put on another show. Benny Sieu-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 14. (17) Minnesota Vikings: They’re 3-2, but 0-2 on the road, which is where they head this week when they meet up with those rascally Lions, who finally won a game. Seriously, Vikings. Don’t blow this. And yet for some reason I think you will. Brace Hemmelgarn-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 13. (10) New York Giants: At 3-3, the Giants are still very much alive. And that’s even after watching the dreadfully disgusting performance Monday night in Philadelphia when I thought I was watching “The Walking Dead.” Where’s Daryl Dixon and his crossbow when you need him? Eric Hartline-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 12. (12) San Diego Chargers: I just don’t feel right moving the Chargers down after they almost upended the Packers in Green Bay. I will, though, if they follow that game up with a stinker this week against Oakland, where it stinks a lot. Good thing this game is in San Diego. Benny Sieu-USA TODAY Sports 11. (7) Indianapolis Colts: The Swinging Gate? Wait, that’s like the Picket Fence in the movie, “The Hoosiers,” right? Oh, never mind. Brian Spurlock-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 10. (18) Philadelphia Eagles: By virtue of their Monday night victory over the Giants in what might have been the sloppiest NFL game played in years, the 3-3 Eagles sit in first place in the NFC East. I know. That’s not saying much. But it’s true. We’ll know a lot more about these guys Sunday. Bill Streicher-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 9. (11) Pittsburgh Steelers: Welcome to the NFL, Landry Jones. It’s been a while, but it was worth the wait judging from your debut performance in leading your team to a very respectable victory over the visiting Cardinals. Good luck in Kansas City. Jason Bridge-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 8. (4) Arizona Cardinals: Drop four spots this week after a shaky display at Pittsburgh but if anyone thinks I’m ranking the Cardinals behind the Steelers just because the Steelers pulled out the victory with their third-string quarterback, they’re crazy. They will get back on track Monday night. Jason Bridge-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 7. (6) Atlanta Falcons: A 10-point loss on the road at New Orleans ended the Falcons’ undefeated start, but at 5-1, this team is still a force to be reckoned with and the lowly Tennessee Titans will be certain to feel it this Sunday, minus an injured Marcus Mariota. Chuck Cook-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 6. (9): New York Jets: I wish I would have drafted Chris Ivory on at least one of my two Fantasy League teams. Don’t you? The 4-1 Jets face a huge test this week on the road at 5-0 New England. Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 5. (5) Denver Broncos: The more and more you hear the NFL talking heads, the more you might, too, believe that Peyton Manning is in need of a walker, some reading glasses and a couple of hearing aids. OK, so maybe he’s 39, but the dude is in charge of a team that’s still 6-0. James Lang-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 4. (8) Carolina Panthers: As far as I can tell, there’s only one person out there that’s disagreed with my assessment of the Panthers this season. But let me just say I might have been w-, w-, w-, wrong about Carolina. They’re 5-0 and last week beat the Seahawks in Seattle. Impressive stuff. Troy Wayrynen-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 3. (3) Cincinnati Bengals: They were also 6-0 to start the 1975 and 1988 seasons and this week, they’re off before returning for what should be an interesting game at Pittsburgh in Week 8. I think they Bengals can win there even if Ben Roethlisberger is able to play. But, I’ll reserve judgement until then. Timothy T. Ludwig-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 2. (2) New England Patriots: Making a very strong case to move into the No.1 slot, where I’m sure all other Power Rankings have these guys. Not here. Not yet. Let’s see what Todd Bowles and that Jets’ defense has in store this week for Bill Belichick and Tom Brady, shall we? Brian Spurlock-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 1. (1) Green Bay Packers: They had to withstand a career day by Philip Rivers, but the Packers held off the Chargers at Lambeau Field to remain undefeated and they’ll hold down this spot for at least another week because they get the bye. Their next two games are against the Broncos and Panthers. Jeff Hanisch-USA TODAY Sports Like this topic?
