DAVID STEPHENSON — AP Photo \nRandom notes: \n■ The formula for winning in the SEC has much to do with turnovers. \nSEC teams that have not turned the ball over have won 17 of 20 games thus far. That's 85 percent. That's a pretty good win-probability percentage. \nIn conference games, teams that didn't turn over the ball but forced a turnover are 7-1. There have been two SEC games — LSU's win over Mississippi State and Kentucky's win over Missouri — in which neither team committed a turnover. \nSEC teams that have forced opponents to turn over the ball three times or more are a perfect 15-0 this season. Five of those were conference games. \n■ Just over a week before Auburn arrives at Commonwealth Stadium for the historic (for UK) Thursday night, and there's more Tiger trouble. \nTalented but star-crossed wide receiver Duke Williams got the boot from head coach Gus Malzahn on Monday night. Turns out Williams punched his way off the team, allegedly slugging four people in an Auburn bar over the weekend. Two were security guards. \nWonder whether Williams was that physical with his downfield blocking? \n■ Auburn's defense gave up more yards to San Jose State (406) than it did to Mississippi State (326) the week before. Just saying. \n■ If I were a betting man, I would bet that Rick Pitino survives this Louisville sex/recruiting scandal. There might be something to the allegations about escorts and recruits and former assistant Andre McGee, but there are holes in the stories. \nMore often than not, coaches survive through plausible deniability. \n■ Thanks to Matt Hayes of the Sporting News for pointing out this stat: LSU's Leonard Fournette is averaging 216 rushing yards per game. That's more rushing yards per game than 103 entire FBS teams are averaging. \n■ Paul Brown Stadium is sold out for Sunday's Bengals-Seahawks game. Cincinnati is 4-0. Had the officials known the rules Monday night, two-time NFC champion Seattle could easily be 1-3. \n■ This might be a minority opinion, but I side with the Reds in bringing back manager Bryan Price for 2016. I expect there to be some changes in the Cincinnati coaching staff, but Price was hamstrung by injuries and the loss of Johnny Cueto and Mike Leake. He has a proven record with young pitchers. And the Reds will have a ton of young pitchers next season. \n■ Georgia travels to a desperate Tennessee this Saturday. Picked by some to win the SEC East, the Vols are 2-3. They've blown leads against Oklahoma, Florida and Arkansas on the way to losses. \nJohn Adams of the Knoxville News-Sentinel wrote this week, \"The more I watch this team, the more convinced I am that its biggest problem is coaches, not players. My guess is you have reached the same conclusion.\" \n■ The Michigan defense hasn't allowed a point in more than eight quarters and just 14 points in the last four games. The Wolverines are giving up just 184 yards per game. Are were sure Ohio State is the best team in the Big Ten? \n■ Kentucky doesn't just need to get Boom Williams back. It needs to get back the Boom Williams who rushed for 100 yards in each of the first two games. \n■ Dorian Baker received plenty of well-deserved pub for his role in UK's win over Eastern Kentucky, but don't overlook the contribution of Blake Bone, who also made several key catches down the stretch. \n■ Kudos to the Cats and Colonels for their deportment last Saturday. Despite the offseason off-the-field nonsense, I saw no extracurricular scraps or unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. I'm sure there was jawing, but there's jawing in every game. \n■ The way Florida is playing, Kentucky's 14-9 loss to the Gators doesn't look too bad right now. \n■ Tough, tough break for former UK star Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, who suffered a torn labrum in Charlotte's first exhibition game and will miss most if not all of the NBA season. \nMKG used the summer to work on his jump shot, and when MKG goes to work, he goes to work. He'll do the same with his shoulder rehab. John Clay: (859) 231-3226. Email: jclay@herald-leader.com. Twitter: @johnclayiv.
