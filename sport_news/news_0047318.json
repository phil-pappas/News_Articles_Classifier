(AP Photo/Rick Osentoski, File) \nVernon Davis was inactive for the struggling San Francisco 49ers for the second game in a row Sunday night because of a knee injury, even though he practiced a bit throughout the week and both he and coach Jim Tomsula seemed to indicate the player might return. \nAnother member of the 49ers, linebacker Ahmad Brooks, didn't play against the New York Giants because of the death of his sister. \nAmong the inactives for the Giants was, as expected, receiver Victor Cruz. \nWith linebacker Devon Kennard out for New York, Mark Herzlich was going to start. And to account for injuries to defensive ends Robert Ayers Jr. and George Selvie, Cullen Jenkins was going to start at that spot instead of defensive tackle, while second-year player Jay Bromley was tabbed for his first start. \nSAN FRANCISCO AT NEW YORK GIANTS: \nSan Francisco: WR DeAndrew White, RB Mike Davis, LB Gerald Hodges, LB Ahmad Brooks, OL Ian Silberman, NT Mike Purcell, TE Vernon Davis. \nGiants: WR Victor Cruz, DE Robert Ayers Jr., LB Devon Kennard, DE George Selvie, LB Jonathan Casillas, TE Jerome Cunningham, OL Bobby Hart. \nARIZONA AT DETROIT \nCardinals: QB Matt Barkley, WR J.J.
