Jessica Mirocha, above, and her River Ridge teammates can change that this week if they win a series at Houston County. Staff photo by Kathryn Ingall slideshow After one round of the state playoffs, each of the four qualifying Cherokee County softball teams are still alive.Woodstock and Creekview swept their first-round series, while Cherokee and River Ridge were pushed to the brink of elimination before securing their spots in the next round.For Woodstock, a strong pitching performance from Laura Bishop was the difference in a pair of close wins over Dacula, 1-0 and 3-2.The freshman pitcher threw a complete-game shutout in Game 1 and took a no-hitter into the sixth inning of Game 2.Bishop also came up big offensively, leading the Lady Wolverines in hits in the series. Breanna Roper, Danielle Rubin, Lexi Solorzano and Rachel Roddy also played well.Woodstock also benefited from playing in front of its home crowd, and it will get the chance to do so again when it hosts Kennesaw Mountain — a team it beat 6-4 last month — beginning today.“Playing at home is a huge advantage,” Woodstock coach Kortney Dempsey said. “We always play better at home. It’s less travel time on the girls, and they don’t have to miss any class. Plus, you to play in front of your friends and family, and your teachers come out. It’s a special atmosphere.”Although it had to do so on the road, Creekview also swept its first round series, beating Stephenson 15-2 and 2-0.The Lady Grizzlies scored seven runs in the first inning for an easy Game 1 victory over five innings, but Creekview’s bats went quiet in Game 2. A complete-game, 15-strikeout shutout by Bethany Hyde took care of the problem, though, and the Lady Grizzlies advanced.Now, a series at Greenbrier awaits before Creekview can return to the state finals in Columbus.“It’s going to be a hard-fought series,” coach Chance Cain said. “We’re going to need all of our pitchers to keep pitching well, and everyone else to keep playing well. It’s not going to be easy, and we’re going to have to show up, but we’re ready.”Also advancing in Class was River Ridge. The Lady Knights split their first two games with Dunwoody before winning Game 3 to set up a second-round matchup at Houston County.“I was most proud of the way we battled back in Game 3,” River Ridge coach Andrew Marinelli said. “We could have had a big letdown after Game 2, but we didn’t. We did what we needed to do, and we feel good going forward.Savannah Flaherty was the star in the first game, as the freshman struck out 12 in a 3-1 victory. Jessica Mirocha looked just as good in the second game, but River Ridge could not score and lost 2-0.In Game 3, Flaherty threw another shutout, and the River Ridge offense came back to life, clinching the series with a 7-0 win.Cherokee also needed a third game to settle its series with Grayson.Kindall Reeves threw a Game 1 shutout to give the Lady Warriors the edge, but they could not match Grayson’s offense in Game 2. In the final game of the series, Reeves was in the circle again, backed by Deven Bennett and Rachel Catt, who combined for five RBIs in Cherokee’s series-clinching 8-5 win.The Lady Warriors will continue their push towards a championship with a second-round series at Harrison, a team they beat 4-3 on Aug. 29.Cherokee coach Tonya Carlisle said it is nice to have the win to look back on, but she knows things have changed.“Any time you go this deep, there is obviously going to be good competition,” she said. “It was early in the season and not in tournament play. What you do before doesn’t mean a thing in October.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:45:16.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
