The Lady Falcons are ranked No. 2 in the Rio Grande Valley. \nThere was a celebratory atmosphere from the very start at the Los Fresnos gym as a large crowd, including a number of Woods’ former players, gathered to witness the veteran coach reach her milestone. Once Los Fresnos won, it was a time for the victory party to begin with obligatory nonstop “selfies.” Earlier, even the school’s mascot, “Falcon,” wanted to have a picture taken with heralded coach. \nSigns that read “600” were passed out to the home fans, who stood, raised them and enthusiastically cheered on the match’s final point. Some of the fans, along with Woods, donned T-shirts commemorating her 600th win. \nFor the record, Woods’ career coaching mark now stands at 600-319 through 31 seasons. That many victories for a high school volleyball coach is believed to be a first in the Valley. \n“This is great, just awesome,” said Woods, surrounded by the Los Fresnos fans after the match. “It feels great that our girls are still undefeated (in district).” \nRoy Hess covers sports for The Brownsville Herald.
