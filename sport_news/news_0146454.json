And as she also emphasized, the U.S. Supreme Court this year seems to have taken a new tack on content-based restrictions of free speech. It did so in a major case involving outdoor signs and then suggested the same reasoning applied to panhandling, making it harder for cities to crack down.\nBut Arguello's ruling nevertheless fails to recognize the inherently unsettling nature of certain forms of panhandling. Let's say you are accosted by a panhandler in a parking garage late at night while trying to retrieve cash at an ATM, and he makes repeated requests for money while you try to stuff your bills away.\nMany people might feel somewhat intimidated — which is why Denver, for example, currently outlaws panhandling at night and within 20 feet of an ATM, among other restrictions. And yet the judge declared that cities cannot prohibit multiple requests for money, requests made within 20 feet of an ATM, or panhandling after dark.\nShe says, for example, \"There is no indication that panhandling at night ... is inherently dangerous or threatening to the public.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T11:00:00.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
