Offer letters went out to 18 high school players Wednesday morning, shortly after his hiring was announced. Barnum hadn't been aggressive in recruiting to this point, so that opposing coaches couldn't use his interim status against him.\n\"Now you're going to see why I hired this crew,\" Barnum said of his assistants, some of whom relocated their families and turned down other jobs to take a gamble on PSU.\n\"I think these guys are great recruiters and are good with people,\" he continued. \"That's how we're going to win, not because I can draw up a better 'X' than your 'O.'\n\"Don't get me wrong, you have to get them headed the right way and have a good plan, but it's about the players.\"\n In addition to five seasons as offensive coordinator under Burton, Barnum has connections to the Vikings coaches that go back decades.\n\"I was recruited by Pokey Allen,\" said Barnum, a Vancouver native who ended up playing at Eastern Washington in the mid-'80s. \"I followed the program. I saw what Mouse Davis did here.\"\nBarnum recalled going into the office of Tim Walsh when the longtime PSU head coach was hired in 1993.\n\"I wanted a job, but I saw a stack of memos on his desk of guys who called him that day,\" He remembered. \"Tim said 'Barny, all these guys want to talk and I know most of them so I can't hire you.'\n\"I was young and dumb, but I always respected that he was cordial and he always talked to me. He's one of many I talk to and bounce ideas off of.\"\nThough the Vikings have seemingly turned a corner this season, there's still much work to be done if PSU wants to reach the postseason for the first time since 2000. The Big Sky Conference, as always, is full of contenders fighting for 13 at-large berths in FCS playoffs. Only the league champion gets an automatic spot in the 24-team bracket.\nThe good news for the Vikings is that they get traditional Big Sky powers Montana and Montana State at home. Montana State visits Providence Park on Saturday in a game that could make or break the Vikings' chances at a conference title. At 1-1, PSU runs the risk of falling into the lower half of the 13-team league with a loss.\nMontana visits Portland on Oct. 31, and Southern Utah — which has outscored its two Big Sky opponents 74-3 — will be at Providence Park on Nov. 14.\nThe Vikings will be favored to pick up road victories at Cal Poly and Northern Colorado, but the regular season will end on the road against perennial FCS contender Eastern Washington. Depending on how things go during the next month, the Vikings' trip to Cheney on Nov. 21 may be the program's biggest game in 15 years.\nThat's a long way off, though, and Barnum said he's hopeful that the Vikings' momentum can bring more fans to a program that's had attendance woes in recent years. He's even offered to buy fans a postgame beer at a local bar after PSU victories.\n\"My wife's going to kill me when the bill comes,\" he cracked. \"But it's baby steps. For a few moons, this program's been heading down as far as people following it.\n\"I've had some pretty off-the-wall thoughts on publicity, but we're not ready for that yet. Right now, I just need to win games.\"\nSaturday's 66-7 road win over North Texas became a turning point for two programs. While Barnum earned a contract, North Texas fired coach Dan McCarney after absorbing the worst loss ever by an FBS program at the hands of an FCS squad.\nBarnum knows well enough that he will someday be under the same scrutiny.\n\"It's all about 'what have you done for me lately?' in this profession,\" he said. \"I don't feel sorry for (the North Texas coaches). I'm not being heartless, but they knew what they were getting into.\n\"Who I feel sorry for are the families. I've seen my wife and kids and other families go through it. Those guys will get other jobs, but it's brutal. It's the greatest game in the world, but a miserable profession.\"\nBarnum has no fear of the demands of being a head coach, though, and said his team's response to a 19-17 loss to North Dakota on Oct. 3 proved he was up for the job.\n\"It was great to start 3-0, but I was pretty sure I wasn't going to go undefeated in my career,\" he said. \"What I'm proud of is how after that loss, we didn't change. We got more focused that week, and that makes me think we're in the right spot as far as what we're trying to accomplish.\"\nLike all coaches, though, Barnum will eventually be judged by wins and losses. He's ready.\n\"The pressure is why people coach,\" he said. \"They enjoy the roller coaster. The guy behind the desk who can't come out and do something different, I don't want to live that life.\"\n-- Scott Sepich for The Oregonian/OregonLive", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:26:49.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
