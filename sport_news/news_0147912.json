Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 4:39 PM Updated at 4:42 PM Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 4:39 PM Updated at 4:42 PM KANSAS CITY – The Kansas City Chiefs added former Gardner-Webb receiver Kenny Cook to their practice squad Thursday. Cook (Cross Hill, S.C. / Clinton HS) was released by the Chiefs in August after playing in the first three preseason games. He signed with Kansas City in early May as an undrafted free agent and drew high praise during rookie mini camp and Organized Team Activities. The 6-foot-4, 210-pound standout was a two-time FCS All-America selection at Gardner-Webb, finishing his three-year career with 188 catches for 2,432 yards and 21 touchdowns. His 5.7 receptions per game mark set a new school record. Cook was an All-Big South receiver three times in three seasons, earning All-America honors in 2013 and 2014. He caught 64 passes for 758 yards and five touchdowns as a senior and had his best game at VMI, hauling in 12 passes for 251 yards and a pair of touchdowns. His game-winning catch in overtime earned Cook national Player of the Week honors from The Sports Network. He was also the first Gardner-Webb man listed on the prestigious Walter Payton Award Watch List in July prior to his senior season. Cook was at his best as a junior, catching a career-high 76 passes for 1,008 yards and nine touchdowns. He led the Big South in receptions, yards and touchdowns and was named FCS All-America by The Sports Network, College Sporting News, TonySoftli.com and Phil Steele. He posted a 4.54-second time in the 40-yard dash on his pro day this past March and measured a 6’9” wingspan and 10.2” hands. Cook is a December, 2014 graduate of Gardner-Webb with a degree in communication studies.
