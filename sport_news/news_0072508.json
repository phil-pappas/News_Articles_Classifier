Running back Ameer Abdullah had three carries for 16 yards, receiver Golden Tate added a 22-yard catch with a great move along the sideline and the offensive line gave Stafford plenty of time. Stafford also had a 10-yard run on the drive, his longest of the season.\nLions must establish run game \nBefore the season, the current three-game homestand was supposed to be a nice reprieve for the Lions are starting with three of four games on the road, but Sunday's game against the Bears looks a lot tougher than expected before the season.\nThe Lions already lost the first game of their three straight home games with a 42-17 loss to the Cardinals last week, and they come into today's game against Chicago dealing with several injuries as starters like safety James Ihedigbo, defensive tackle Haloti Ngata and\nRegardless of which players are on the field, though, the Lions must try to get their run game going against a Bears defense that ranks 24th against the run. Running back Joique Bell will miss his third straight game for the Lions, but the coaches should consistently feed rookies Ameer Abdullah and Zach Zenner as success in the run game could open things in the pass game.\nThe game kicks off at 1 p.m., and the Lions, who rank 32nd in rushing offense, will try desperately to avoid starting 0-6 against a Chicago team that's won two in a row after losing its first three games.\nTweets from https://twitter.com/detroitnews/lists/lions-beat", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:39:20.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
