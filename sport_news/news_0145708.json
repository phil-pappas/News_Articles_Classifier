Eliot will face the kind of problem all coaches like with the return of former No. 1 defensive tackle Regie Meant to the field against Auburn. With Meant battling a shoulder injury, senior defensive tackle C.J. Johnson has starred with 30 tackles, three tackles for loss and 1.5 sacks in two games. Eliot did not reveal which tackle would start against the Tigers, but he said both linemen will play. “I think it’s a good problem,” Eliot said.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nTowles learning to deal with scrutiny\n» Injury update: Eliot expects Meant, who was sidelined during the Florida game and did not play against Missouri or Eastern Kentucky, to be available for the Wildcats’ next game on Oct. 15 against Auburn. Outside linebacker Denzil Ware missed part of the EKU game with an undisclosed injury but is “getting some work in” during the bye week, according to Eliot.\n» Scout-team players impress: With no game this week and some of the primary rotation players using the bye week to heal from minor injuries, UK’s coaches have given extra practice reps to several players who are poised to redshirt this season or are working on the scout team.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nQ&A: Stoops focused on improving in bye week\nSophomore linebacker Courtney Love, who is sitting out the season as a transfer from Nebraska, and freshman linebacker Eli Brown, who has yet to play for Kentucky, are two of the scout-team players who impressed Eliot Wednesday in extended auditions.\n“Those two guys stick out to me,” Eliot said. “We have plenty of other players that I could name, but I was focusing on the linebackers specifically today and I was impressed with those guys.”\n» Defense focused on finishing sacks : The UK defense’s struggles to contain quarterbacks continued against EKU, with Colonels quarterback Bennie Coney totaling 30 yards and one touchdown on nine carries.\nOn the season, opposing quarterbacks are averaging 45.8 rushing yards per game against Kentucky and have scored five rushing touchdowns.\nTo make matters worse against EKU, Coney managed to elude multiple sacks when a Kentucky defender found his way into the pocket unblocked.\nSign up to get more like this free in your inbox\n“A lot of it is you have to understand what part of rush lane you’re in,” Eliot said. “You have to know where you’re supposed to miss the quarterback. So if you’re an inside rusher you have to make the quarterback flush. You can’t miss the outside of him and let him step up, because there’s nobody there. If you’re an outside rusher, you have to miss on top if you’re going to miss, so that he steps up into the rest of the rushers.”\nUK’s coaches are emphasizing making the play on those potential sacks in advance of the Auburn game.\n“When you come clean, like we have a lot this year where no one is blocking you, then the quarterback can see that,” Eliot said. “It’s harder to get him down, so we’re emphasizing that those guys come under control and get him down when no one blocks them.”\nEmail Jon Hale at jahale@courier-journal.com .
