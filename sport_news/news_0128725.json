The Bishops led for nearly 42 of 48 minutes, but needed a fourth-down stop deep in their own territory to seal the win in the final seconds. “We were playing well and then we gave them new life,” said Bishop England coach John Cantey, whose team is 3-4 overall and 1-0 in 6-AA. “We didn’t shut them down the way we should have and they got rejuvenated. We had to really refocus to come up with that last stop.” Whale Branch (2-4, 0-1) grabbed its first lead with four minutes to play in the fourth quarter on a 10-yard touchdown pass from senior quarterback Jamar Scott to tight end Torric Fair. Bishops senior fullback John DeStefano answered on the first play of the ensuing drive with a 59-yard touchdown run down the Warriors’ sideline to put Bishop England back on top, 26-21. DeStefano finished with 112 yards and two touchdowns on eight carries. Whale Branch rode its 250-pound back D.J. Davis down to the Bishops’ 17-yard line searching for the go-ahead score on what would likely be its final possession. Forced to pass with time running out, the Warriors sputtered inside the Bishops’ red zone. DeStefano ended the threat with a fourth-down sack with 13 seconds remaining. “What I wouldn’t give for one more minute,” Whale Branch head coach Jerry Hatcher said. “We had momentum. We were moving. Everyone was fired up. But we ran out of time.” Bishop England built a 20-7 lead by halftime off the legs of quarterback Leo Albano. The sophomore rushed for 146 yards and two touchdowns in the first half while the Bishops defense limited Whale Branch to just 129 total yards. Albano scored on a 3-yard keeper in the first quarter to give the Bishops their first lead and added a 12-yard touchdown run in the second. DeStefano plowed in for a 2-yard score behind senior center Blake Jeresaty, a Wofford commitment, to put the Bishops up 20-7 with less than minute to play in the first half. Bishop England finished the game with 283 total yards to Whale Branch’s 282. Albano led the Bishops with 159 yards on 16 carries. Davis finished with 153 yards and Scott was 4-5 passing for 50 yards and two touchdowns for Whale Branch. “We wanted to set the tone for the rest of the season tonight,” DeStefano said. “We’ve been kind of pushed around by some bigger schools. We went against a big running team tonight but we were able to stop them when it counted in the fourth quarter. That was big.” Bishop England will host Garrett next week. “Our non-region scheduled prepared us well for tonight and that kind of fourth quarter,” Cantey said. “We’re in AA play. It’s going to be power football all the time. If you’re not ready for it, you’re not going far.” Keywords", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:16:51.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
