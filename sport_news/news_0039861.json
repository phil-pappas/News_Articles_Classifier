This was the fifth consecutive year GameTime has worked with the Colts organization to build a playground at a deserving Indianapolis School.\nThe project at Floro Torrence included a new Colts-themed play system, with plenty of climbing, spinning and sliding activities to keep children active, outdoors. There is also an outdoor education area for teachers to extend learning outside the walls of the classroom. A project that would normally take a crew a week or more, was completed in a single day, thanks to the hard work of dozens of volunteers.\nRich Sinclair is Vice President of Sinclair Recreation, GameTime’s exclusive representative in Indiana. He was on hand to coordinate the community-led playground installation. He’s been involved with all five Colts installations and appreciates the commitment of the team and the community to create active play areas for children. “It’s an amazing opportunity to be out here, to build something that’s going to impact the mental, physical, and emotional health of children,” said Sinclair. “With skyrocketing rates of juvenile diabetes and youth obesity, anything that we can do collectively to get kids to put their electronics down, to come outside, to play and be active is a big win.”\nPlayers from the Colts were on hand to help with the installation and saw the project as a chance to give back to the community. In a statement on the team’s website, Colts Linebacker Amarlo Herrera said, “You always have to give back. People look up to us and it’s a part of our job to go to the community and show that we can do something else besides football.”\nAbout GameTime\nGameTime is a leading US manufacturer of commercial playgrounds, custom play spaces and outdoor fitness equipment.
