Well, they haven’t actually dipped their oars in the water yet. They’ve been more vicarious travelers following two women who have volunteered to do the back-aching, 740-mile row. “Rowing is hard. I have lots of sore muscles and callouses on my hands,” Rachael Mallon told fourth-graders in Andrea Nilles’s class at Osborn Elementary here last week. Nillis’s students are following the rowers on their trip via an interactive map, photos and blogs on their internet site — rowboatclassroom.org. They’ve been studying Washington’s only crayfish species, other wildlife along the river and water quality through science curriculum linked to the trip. Mallon and Kai Schwartz, outdoor science educators for an organization called OAR Northwest, visited the classroom to tell students about their adventures. Third-grade and fifth-grade classes also gathered around to hear the presentation. All of the students ran out to the playground afterward to view their 17-foot fiberglass rowboat, which was sitting on a boat trailer. “I think it would be really hard. I’m not that good at sleeping out,” said fifth-grader Olivia Cappellini about the women’s plan to row the river’s length in 43 days. “I’ve rowed. It’s hard to row,” said Coral Forbes, 10. She has her own kayak, she said, and paddling a kayak is easier. Still, she said, she might like to try rowing the Columbia someday. Mallon and Schwartz stopped in at the school on day 12 of their adventure down the Columbia. Schwartz is a temporary fill-in for Leah Shamlian, who had to take a few days off from the trip. They told students about seeing six bears along the way — one who raided their campsite and made for a sleepless night. They’ve seen lots of eagles. “It’s a bad day if we don’t see a bald eagle,” Mallon said. There’s been lots of wildlife sighting while rowing between Canada and Wenatchee. “The wildfires this summer destroyed the animals’ homes, so they’re out looking for new ones.” Mallon also told them about animal inventories, water quality tests and collecting samples of the signal crayfish, the Pacific Northwest’s only crayfish species and thought to be in decline. Mallon said they’ve found lots of evidence to the contrary. Their research data is sent on to schools to follow and also the University of Washington to be used in Columbia River Watershed studies. Students were fascinated by the information and projected photos of the trip. Just to make sure they didn’t lose focus on the science, Schwartz would jump to the floor every few minutes to lead the students in isometric rowing exercises. “Pull those oars waaay back,” she told them. And they eagerly did. Rowing down the Columbia is quite an ambitious adventure, but it’s pretty mellow compared to rowing across an ocean. OAR Northwest was created after Seattle adventurers Jordan Hanssen and Greg Spooner rowed across the Atlantic Ocean with two other crew in a 30-foot boat in 2006. That crossing was part of a race in which they set a record of 72 days to cover 3,600 miles between New York and England. The trip raised money for the American Lung Association. Hanssen and Spooner have since gone on to row around Vancouver Island, the Olympic Peninsula and make another Atlantic trip between Senegal, Africa and Miami, Florida. Their boat, loaded with scientific gear, swamped and overturned a few hundred miles short of their destination and they had to be rescued. Hanssen has turned his recent adventures into a book, “Rowing into the Sun,” lecture presentations and the OAR NW adventure education and research program, involving schools around the world. Last year, he rowed the length of the Mississippi River, stopping at schools along the way. That trip took eight months to plan out and complete, Hanssen said when he stopped in Wenatchee last week to help the women rowers portage their boat around the Columbia’s many Central Washington dams. The Columbia River trip was put together more quickly, but the women expect to stop at about half dozen schools along the way where classrooms are following their travels with science curriculum. The concept of getting kids involved in STEM subjects — science, technology, environment and math — through outdoor adventure works well, Hanssen believes. More trips are being planned for the future. “You have to constantly re-engage kids to get them involved,” he said. “Everybody enjoys learning. You just have to find a way to engage them.” More like this story", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:44:33.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
