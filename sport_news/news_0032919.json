He spoke on condition of anonymity in line with government rules that bar officials from speaking to journalists without authorization.\nPrime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu raised the death toll in the attacks to 99 from the previous 97, during a television interview on Wednesday.\nHe has said that the main focus of the investigation into the blasts is the Islamic State group. He said Wednesday that the PKK were also under suspicion.\n\"As the investigation deepens, and based especially on certain results we have obtained through Twitter accounts and IP addresses, we can see that both Daesh (IS) and the PKK are groups that are likely to have played an active role,\" Davutoglu said.\nAnalysts, however, expressed skepticism about claims of the PKK's involvement, given that the attack targeted Kurdish activists.\nTurkish authorities on Wednesday imposed a ban on reporting on the details of the investigation.\nThe suicide bombings struck at the heart of the capital just weeks before Turkey holds a national election on Nov. 1, following an inconclusive election in June and after a summer of violence that has claimed hundreds of lives.\nThe two suspects allegedly posted tweets that said: \"The bomb will explode in Ankara\" and \"What if (the Islamic State group) explodes (a bomb) in Ankara?\"\nTurkey's Interior Ministry said Ankara's police chief and two police chiefs in charge of security and intelligence in the city had been suspended, apparently pending the outcome of an investigation into possible security flaws.\nOn Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador John Bass laid carnations at the site of the blasts and held a moment of silence in respect of the victims.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:44:39.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
