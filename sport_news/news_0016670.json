Alabama plays at Texas A&M on Saturday. Marvin Gentry \nRethinking the now underrated SEC on this week's Monday Morning SEC Hot Cakes ... hot takes not available until the lunch menu rolls over at 10:30 a.m... \nThe SEC hasn't featured a dominant team this season, but that doesn't mean some total domination isn't going on around the league. \nThe overall depth of the conference initially was overhyped, but three undeniable national forces have emerged entering the seventh week. Ranked in order of the fear they induce in opponents, here are the most frightening things the SEC has had to offer on a football field so far this season: \n1. Leonard Fournette (ranked first nationally in rushing yards per game, 204.40) \n2. Alabama's rushing defense (ranked fourth nationally, 77.3 yards per game) \n3. Florida's pass rush (tied for third nationally in sacks, 21.0) \nNot bad, but apparently not good enough to get their teams into the top 5 of the AP poll. More on the suddenly underrated SEC in a moment, but first a closer look at Leonard Fournette's epic start to the season as he prepares for the brightest stage of his career, Saturday's home game against the rival Gators. \nFournette's streak of games with at least 200 yards rushing ended on Saturday against South Carolina, but not because the Gamecocks figured out how to stop LSU's offense. To the contrary, LSU took a step forward even though Fournette didn't pocket two bills for the fourth consecutive week. While Fournette only rushed for 158 yards (7.9 per carry), the Tigers' offense piled up 624 yards of total offense, and rushed for 396 (a school record). \nThose numbers would be notable for any team, but especially one coached by Les Miles, whose offenses trend toward the conservative side of cautious. After Saturday's home-away game, Miles' Tigers have hit the 600-yard mark for total offense only twice in the last 10 years. \nLSU quarterback Brandon Harris passed for a season-high 228 yards, and freshman running back Derrius Guice rushed for 161 yards on 16 carries. It was just the second time in LSU school history that two players rushed for at least 150 yards in the same game. A lot of Guice's yards came in the second half against a defense fatigued by the circumstances of a road-home game, but also made soft by the constant pounding of Fournette. \nLSU reached its season high for total offense despite Fournette averaging just 3.3 yards on 15 carries in the first half. Keying on Fournette, South Carolina managed to keep it close at halftime, but you can only stop the best back in LSU football history for so long. Fournette feasted in the third quarter, breaking off his second carry of the second half for an 87-yard score. \nHe had 109 yards on the ground in the third quarter, and that output added to what has to be one of the most incredible statistical trends of the first half of the college-football season. Fournette is now averaging 13.15 yards per carry in third quarters. \nFORCES COLLIDE \nFournette's third-quarter dominance will be put to the test this weekend. The Gators' rushing defense has been at its best in those periods, allowing just 2.24 yards per carry. Undefeated rivals underwritten by the matchup of Fournette versus the Gators' defense will give Death Valley an electric feel this weekend. It's easily the biggest game between the two teams since Tim Tebow visited Baton Rouge, La., his senior season. \nThe Gators' defense is coming off another impressive performance. In its 21-3 victory against Missouri, Florida allowed just 12 first downs and had two interceptions. In addition to the superior rushing defense, the Gators have made things difficult for opposing quarterbacks this season. Florida has recorded at least three sacks in every game. \n\"The fun part is now we get to break this game down, get it over with and we get to go on the road again, back to back, and play in one heck of an environment against a team that is playing great and obviously has been picked to beat us by a bunch,\" Florida coach Jim McElwain said. \"That's okay, we are going to go in and compete, and we will put a plan together.\" \nLSU opened as a 7 ½-point favorite against Florida, a point spread that apparently offended Florida's coach. \nTOLEDO EFFECT \nMy halftime thoughts during Alabama's Great Scare: Toledo needs some more love. \nWhile most of the State of Alabama was in a state of panic (or ecstasy) at halftime on Saturday, I couldn't shake the Rockets of Northwest Ohio out of my thoughts. I know I wasn't alone. \nAlabama was losing 7-3 at halftime to Arkansas, a team that lost to Toledo. For critics of the SEC looking for any score or trend to discredit the league — and there are quite a few out there these days — Alabama's slow start against Arkansas reaffirmed some suspicions. The SEC just isn't that good this season. \nOverrated by association is perhaps one of the most misguided ways to judge the quality of a football team, but apparently Alabama fell victim to that lazy approach to subjective analysis in the new AP Top 25. Alabama dropped two spots this week to No.10 despite a victory. \nAlabama coach Nick Saban likes to say second halves are \"when you find out who you are,\" but apparently AP voters already had their minds made up by halftime. National fatigue for the league is real this season, y'all, and I know this sounds crazy, but something like Arkansas' loss to Toledo might indirectly be used to keep a one-loss SEC team out of the College Football Playoff this season. \nMake no mistake, it still seems almost impossible that an undefeated SEC team would get locked out of the playoff, but at this point it's not hard to imagine a scenario in which the College Football Playoff Committee elects to leave a one-loss Florida, LSU or Alabama at home. \nFor the record, Toledo is still undefeated and now ranked No.22 in the AP Top 25. In other words, Arkansas' loss to the Rockets actually doesn't seem so bad at this point in the season. Of course, something tells me that type of reasoning won't ever be used to the defend the SEC. \nAGGIES AWAIT \nAlabama's drop in the AP poll put the Crimson Tide one spot behind No.9 Texas A&M, which was idle on Saturday. The last time Alabama was ranked lower than its opponent (other than two weeks ago against Georgia) was on Nov.15, 2014, when the No.4 Crimson Tide defeated No.1 Mississippi State 25-20. \nPerhaps a little frustrated with their low ranking, Alabama's coach and his players have been uncharacteristically vocal about their team's bona fides in recent weeks. First, coach Nick Saban voiced his displeasure with fans and reporters for judging his team too early. In hindsight, that fiery rhetoric might have backfired considering those first-half struggles with Arkansas. \nUndeterred, though, Alabama's defenders boasted onward one day after keeping their team in the game with the Razorbacks. Some on the defense apparently believe they have the best unit in the country \"hands down.\" Michigan might disagree, but it's another Big Ten team that probably will be discussed this week as Alabama prepares for Texas A&M. \nOn Saturday, Alabama's rushing defense gets its first shot at a mobile quarterback (of a good team) since last season's 42-35 loss to Cardale Jones and Ohio State in the College Football Playoff semifinal. \nWith two weeks to prepare for Alabama, Texas A&M coach Kevin Sumlin, offensive coordinator Jake Spavital and Aggies quarterback Kyle Allen have probably reviewed film of that game a few times. \nJoseph Goodman is a senior reporter and columnist for AL.com.
