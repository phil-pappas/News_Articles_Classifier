We obviously didn’t have the right formula last night,” Sarkisian said Friday. “My job is to try and figure that out. It’s easy to look at the film and say, we should have run it, we should have thrown it, we should have blitzed more, we should have played coverage. But the reality is, it was bigger than that.\n“I hate to dodge the question, but I don’t know yet. I’m still working at it, I’m still looking at it, I’m still trying to figure all that out. Because it’s important. It’s a huge, huge question.”\nEighteen games into the Sarkisian era, USC remains inconsistent. Based on the star ratings of the school’s recruits, many also would describe the Trojans as underachievers. USC was a double-figure favorite in four of the six losses suffered since Sarkisian became coach.\nUSC (3-2, 1-2 Pac-12) did not appear to be as inspired and did not play as crisply as Washington on Thursday night. The Trojans committed eight penalties, the third game in a row in which they have had at least eight. They also had a season-high three turnovers.\nSarkisian said he isn’t worried about losing the locker room. He did not meet with the team Friday morning, instead sticking to the schedule that has them gathering Sunday morning before the resumption of practice that afternoon.\n“It’s a team. It’s not just the coaches, it’s not just us,” sophomore guard Viane Talamaivao told reporters after the game. “It’s all of us. If we win, if our team wins, our coaches win and our players win. And if we lose, our coaches lost and we lost.\n“It is unfair to put the blame on any particular person or particular group, or any coach or anything like that. We just didn’t execute as a coaching staff, a team and as individual players.”\nSaid Sarkisian: “This team is not … going astray or losing the messaging from us or anything else. This team wants to win. It’s not about want-to. I’m not as concerned about that as I am our performance. If I felt that way, I would have met with them at 7a.m.\n“These guys are in a good place. They’re going to be OK, and we’re going to be OK.”\nSarkisian said he still believes the Trojans are “headed in the right direction.” The only certainty is that they’re headed to Notre Dame next week.\nQUICK HITS\nSarkisian didn’t have any definitive information on the injuries suffered by center Max Tuerk (knee), defensive lineman Claude Pelon (knee), receiver Steven Mitchell Jr. (ankle) and cornerback Iman Marshall (upper body). But Sarkisian said all of them could be “significant.” Marshall tweeted Friday morning that he’s “all good.” … The injuries to Marshall and Mitchell put cornerback-receiver Adoree’ Jackson in a “very tough situation,” Sarkisian said. With receivers Darreus Rogers and Christian Tober also out, Jackson played a season-high 30 snaps on offense and 94 overall (54 defense, 10 special teams).\nContact the writer: mlev@ocregister.com\nRelated: Five observations: Washington 17, USC 12 VIDEO: USC-Washington afterthoughts Upset loss to Washington is low point for USC under Steve Sarkisian Miller: Steve Sarkisian outcoached, USC outplayed in loss to Washington", "external_links": ["http://www.ocregister.com/usc/usc-686785-five-observations.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/usc-686779-sarkisian-trojans.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/usc/washington-686784-usc-thursday.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/sarkisian-686778-usc-trojans.html"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:43:11.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
