All of the aforementioned are among our favorites for 2015. Here's why:\n• Throughout October, H&M will contribute 25 percent of the purchase price of selected women's and home products, including a mod floral minidress and a shaggy pink pillow to the American Cancer Society Making Strides Against Breast Cancer initiative, up to $70,000. Customers also can donate at the register. Sales of other special products contribute to the cause, including a skirt, top, throw blankets, towels and bed linens, from $2.99 to $129. Supporters also can join walks through Making Strides Against Breast Cancer, whose events across the nation raise more than $60 million for the American Cancer Society each year. See www.makingstrideswalk.org/h&m .\n• If you're never bought a single item through a home-shopping channel, QVC's FFANY Shoes on Sale might make you a convert. On Oct. 22, QVC, in partnership with the charitable foundation of the Fashion Footwear Association of New York (FFANY), will feature a sale of approximately 150 styles of shoes donated from more than 80 brands such as Vince Camuto, Nine West and Badgley Mischka. They will be sold at half the suggested retail price — with a minimum of 80 percent of the proceeds benefiting various breast cancer research and education institutions.\nThroughout October, QVC will feature a special online collection and will unveil the Shoe of the Day each weekday 6 to 8 a.m. Central time on the air.\nWe have our eyes on the Vince Camuto Parshell leather knee-high boots with studs marching up the back. But there's a pair for every taste and lifestyle, from Dansko's Ruby leather Mary Jane wedges (sale priced at $85) to A2 by Aerosoles Slow Ride midcalf boots ($37.50). Be ready to pounce when the three-hour sale starts at 5 p.m. Central time. qvc.com. Afterward, shoes will be available while supplies last through QVC.com, the QVC apps and by calling 800-345-1515.\n• The BCRF catalog is brimming with fashion, beauty, fitness and home items, but among our favorites are new additions from Tory Burch. This year's limited edition accessories include a pale pink tote, print scarf and zip-pouch key fob. She is donating 20 percent of the purchase of each product (priced from $32 to $295) to the foundation, up to $35,000. All pieces are available in October at Tory Burch boutiques and online at www.toryburch.com .\nAlso on the www.bcrfcure.org/shop-pink site will be Alex and Ani 's Spiral Sun expandable wire bangle from the Charity by Design collection. Referencing the sun's nourishing warmth, the bangle with charm is $38, and 20 percent of the purchase price will go to the foundation, with a minimum donation of $25,000. It's available now through December at Alex and Ani retail locations, www.alexandani.com and authorized retailers.\nPreferring the subtle references to the signature pink, we appreciate Movado's Bold for Breast Cancer Research watches with a pearly pink face, no ribbon. From each purchase ($450 to $795), $50 will be donated to the BCRF. They're available throughout October at www.movado.com and fine retail locations.\nSome brands and stores elect to donate a blanket sum to breast cancer nonprofits that isn't contingent on any customer purchase. Jo Malone London pledged $45,000 to the BCRF for 2015, and Tom Ford Beauty will donate $50,000 to the BCRF — generosity that's worthy of shopper loyalty.\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Breast Cancer University of Michigan National Breast Cancer Awareness Month University of Pennsylvania", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560c12bf/turbine/sc-fash-1005-fashion-donates-breast-cancer-20150929", "http://www.makingstrideswalk.org/h&m", "http://www.bcrfcure.org/shop-pink"], "published": "2015-09-30T19:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:37:26.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
