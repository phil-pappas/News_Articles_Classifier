Bautista's monster home run to break Game 5 open – and eventually sink the Texas Rangers – was stuff of legends. \nBENCHES CLEAR \nNeedless to say, the Rangers didn't appreciate – throughout the entire ALDS, actually – the Blue Jays showboating. Benches cleared after Bautista stared down Rangers pitcher Sam Dyson following the aforementioned home run, finishing out a crazy seventh inning that began with one of the most controversial moments in ALDS history. \nGAME UNDER 'PROTEST' \nAhead of Bautista's homer and benches clearing, Game 5 of the ALDS was stirred up after catcher Russell Martin's attempted toss back to the mound deflected off Shin-Shoo Choos bad, allowing a Rangers runner to score from third. Upon review, the run was allowed, sparking rage in the bleachers. \nFULL BEERS FLY \nThere was a massive delay following the Shin-Shoo Choo incident when Jays fans decided to bombard the diamond with full- and half-empty beer cans. Some women and children headed for the exits after being struck by projectiles while sitting in high-priced seats next to the field. That prompted the Jays to issue a beer can ban on unruly fans sitting in the nosebleeds for the rest of the postseason. \nJAYS ADVANCE \nThere's nothing like the final pitch in a series win. Check out Roberto Osuna's reaction following the strikeout that wrapped up Toronto's first playoff series win in 22 years. \nCRACK MAYOR \nRob Ford: The gift that keeps on giving. Fans in Kansas City welcomed the Jays for ALCS Games 1 and 2 by taking a shot at Toronto's former mayor.

Sports (@SlamSports) October 23, 2015 \nPOSITION PLAYER PITCHING \nIt's one of those records you want to avoid claiming in the playoffs. The Blue Jays became the first team in MLB history to allow an every day position player to pitch in a playoff game after the Royals roughed up R.A. Dickey – and the rest of the Jays pitching staff – in Game 4. \nPILLAR BEING PILLAR \nHere's just a spectacular catch from Jays centre-field Kevin Pillar to kick off Game 3 of the ALCS. \nLIBRARY BROUHAHA \nAfter the Kansas City Public Library used \"book spine poetry\" to take a shot at the Blue Jays, the Toronto Public Library answered when the Jays claimed two of three games at Rogers Centre to cut the series lead to 3-2. \nOur friends at Kansas City Public Library shared some book spine poetry with us this morning (http://ow.ly/TGJxS ) but we've got a way with words too. #ComeTOgether #GoJaysGo", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T18:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:50:24.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
