The Blue Jays play the winner of Wednesday night's Game 5 between Houston and Kansas City. Game 1 of the ALCS is Friday night. Jose Bautista hit a three-run homer to cap an event-filled, 53-minute seventh inning that took a turn when catcher Russell Martin's throw back to the pitcher deflected off batter Shin-Soo Choo and allowed the tiebreaking run to score. The Blue Jays filed a protest after an umpire review ruled Rougned Odor was allowed to cross home plate. Toronto fans pelted the field with debris during the 18-minute delay. The Rangers started the bottom half by making three straight errors and Toronto rallied. \n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
