Simply put, Dantonio is on the short list of the most accomplished coaches in college football in this decade. \nSo take his perspective on the final 20 seconds against Rutgers late Saturday night for what it's worth. \n\"It (was) very hectic. Absolutely, it's extremely hectic in those last seconds,'' Dantonio told NJ Advance Media after watching his team survive Rutgers' rally attempt. \nRELATED: What happened on last play of Rutgers' loss to Michigan State? \nTold that Norries Wilson in an adjacent room had just taken the blame for telling quarterback Chris Laviano to spike the ball on fourth down, Dantonio said both Rutgers' interim head coach and quarterback should be given a pass. \n\"There's 17 seconds to go, he's trying to get people lined up,'' Dantonio said. \"The clock's probably going to run down to two seconds, or something like that. It was chaotic. \n\"All of sudden he spikes the ball and everybody on our sideline was yelling, 'It's fourth down.' It was chaotic so I wouldn't be too hard on the quarterback. He made a lot of plays. He made a lot of plays.'' \nPLUS: Blame Kyle Flood for Rutgers' fourth-down spike snafu | Politi \nLaviano threw for 208 yards and three touchdowns without an interception on 15-for-24 passing in his most efficient performance of the season. \nAlthough his record now stands at 1-3 as Rutgers' starter, Laviano leads the Big Ten in pass efficiency (153.9), completing 87-of-124 passes for 1,002 yards this fall. \nHis 70.2 completion percentage ranks sixth-best in the nation after six weeks. \n\"I think the offense fought really hard,'' Laviano said. \"I think there's things we can improve on obviously because we didn't score as many points as them. Ultimately we had chances to win the game and we didn't. ... I think I took care of the ball well and made plays when they were there. We were in a tough situation in the final seconds and it just didn't go in our favor.'' \nKeith Sargeant may be reached at ksargeant@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @KSargeantNJ .
