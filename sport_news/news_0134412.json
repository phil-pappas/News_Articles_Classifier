That change as Al Golden was relieved of his duties as head coach and another opening has come to the world of college football. As with the South Carolina opening the name Mark Stoops is being bandied about as a potential replacement for the vacancy. This time it’s coming from South Florida newspaper, The Palm Beach Post , and here’s what they had to say: \nMark Stoops, Kentucky coach: A promising 4-2 in Lexington (entering Saturday) after going 7-17 in his first two seasons. Stoops left a job as Florida State’s defensive coordinator, where he had been since 2009, to coach UK. Would the 48-year-old return to Coral Gables, where he was defensive backs coach under Larry Coker from 2001-03? A person close to Stoops said he still has property in the area and would likely consider the job if offered. One of the better South Florida recruiters on this list. Would UM, which pays Golden $2.54 million per year, pay him at least the $3.25 million he makes at Kentucky? \n[The Palm Beach Post: Seven possibilities for Miami Hurricanes after firing Al Golden ] \nSo this begs the question, is Miami an elite level program that Stoops would consider leaving for? The days of “The U” are long gone while Florida and FSU have dominated the state for the past decade. As Matt said on the radio earlier this month, if Miami came calling he could see it playing out like Charlie Strong and Tennessee. That is, a “Thanks, but no thanks”. Kentucky now has better facilities, a sleeping giant football fanbase, and, thanks to the SEC network, more resources to pay the man. Stoops’ personal ties and the recruiting base would be compelling but in the end I don’t think it is a program to worry about. \nHow about you?

RealitySays October 25, 2015 at 10:52   \nI don’t get it. Stoops has had ZERO real success at UK other than a few supposed recruiting victories. And judging from the progress of one of his so-called top recruit, Matt Elam, I’d say a school like Miami will certainly look elsewhere. Ha!

He hasn’t shown that he can win at a high level yet. He needs to show more first. Although, I don’t believe Miami is an elite program anymore or a better job than Kentucky necessarily. Seriously October 25, 2015 at 11:00   \nWait, according to many of the commenters (aka the self-appointed “experts” of football) around here, Stoops is incompetent. Why would a program with a winning tradition want to go after him? Weird… Tony Montana October 25, 2015 at 11:09 pm | Permalink \nHuh? Eazy E or Eric Wright it's all the same October 25, 2015 at 11:09 pm | Permalink \nlol, The U is not going after Stoops because some douche from the Palm Beach Post threw his name out as a suggestion. Elmer Skaggs October 25, 2015 at 11:12   \nWhy would Stoops leave Kentucky where six wins is the ultimate measure of success The Rest of the story October 25, 2015 at 11:22 pm | Permalink \nWhoa Larry Clapp October 25, 2015 at 11:24 pm | Permalink \nHey, they can’t all play in the AAC or ACC or BigEast or CUSA or whatever. The Rest of the story October 25, 2015 at 11:24 pm | Permalink \nHold on there Elmer, Stoops has yet to win 6 and doing that this year gets slimmer every game. I only see one more sure game but after the EKU debacle that is not all that sure. Elmer Skaggs October 25, 2015 at 11:48 pm | Permalink \nHe would also have to deal with brutal Miami sports media instead of Kindsey and Kelsey and idiots like Nick Roush and Drew Franklin bigpoppapump October 25, 2015 at 11:56   \nPlease let this be true. Wait – when they ask him who he plans on hiring as special teams coordinator and he says “uh I don’t see the need for one of those” that will end any chance he has. Al Golden has never played with 8 guys on the field. Might as well keep him if Stoops is their best option.
