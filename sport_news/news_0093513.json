Posted: Friday, October 23, 2015 11:23 pm Cumberland becomes playoff eligible with 50-20 win Keith Stewart For the Daily   \nARTHUR — Week nine wasn’t just another week for Cumberland. \nComing into Friday night’s matchup against Arthur-Lovington/Atwood-Hammond 4-4 on the year, the Pirates needed a win in order to have a shot at the post-season. \nAnd with their 50-20 victory, they earned just that. \n“It’s satisfying to get the win,” said Cumberland head coach Lucas Watkins. “It gives us an opportunity, and that’s all we want. If we could go back and do some things differently the first three games of the season, we’d like to, but we can’t. All we can do is look forward. I’m proud of the kids for the way they’ve responded in the second half of the season.” \nThe Pirates wasted no time in taking control Friday. After the Knights’ nearly missed picking up the opening kickoff, a high snap over the head of quarterback Marcus Vanausdoll would be recovered by Tyler Smith, who was promptly tackled by Cumberland for a safety just 11 seconds in. The Pirates would then put together five straight carries before a 14-yard touchdown pass from Brody Donsbach to Ryan Yaw. \nThe Knights would pickup a first down on their first play of the second series with a Vanausdoll keeper up the middle. The sophomore, who was playing quarterback for the first time this season, would end up going to the sideline afterwards, briefly, for an injury, but would return. \nVanausdoll would be replaced by Kobe Wells until the start of their third series. Meanwhile, Cumberland got back to the end zone following a 79-yard pass to Dreyton Ruholl, who would finish the game with 114 yards on three receptions and one touchdown. Donsbach would finish 6-of-11 passing for 174 yards and two touchdowns. \n“We saw some stuff on film in their coverage that we thought we could exploit,” said Watkins. “Ruholl got vertical there a couple times. It was kind of pitch and catch.” \nCumberland would lead the Knights 23-0 after the first and the beginning of the second was no better for ALAH. \nJust 11 seconds into the second, Cumberland’s Austin Kline blocked the Knights’ punt, recovered, and ran the ball back 25 yards for the score. It would be one of two on the night for Kline. \nBut ALAH would score on its sixth drive in the second quarter. After a facemask penalty against Cumberland on the return, Vanausdoll connected with Wells for a 64-yard reception to score with 6:03 remaining in the half. \nThe Knights’ offense also saw success in their option game during the second half, scoring once in the third following Vanausdoll’s pitch outside to Smith, and then again in the fourth with the same duo 10 yards out. \n“ We saw it on film, and we knew they’d run it,” said Watkins. “We had some kids get out of place a little bit. Our outside backer was supposed to be on the pitch man but got blocked and wasn’t where they were supposed to be, so that’s why it looked so wide open.” \nCumberland’s reserves would see time in the second half with a running clock beginning halfway through the third. What damage had been dealt in the first half proved too much for the Knights to overcome. \nBut the win wasn’t completely satisfying for Watkins, despite becoming playoff eligible at 5-4 on the year. \n“I just told the kids I was proud of them for the win, but I didn’t think we came out as intense as we normally do,” said Watkins. “At week nine we shouldn’t be making the penalties that we did. Just way too many penalties. We had some miscommunication up front with the offensive line, and that stuff can’t happen in week nine. So as glad as I am with the win I’m still not satisfied with where we’re at. We have to clean that stuff up.” \nAnd the Pirates will get that chance depending on the outcome of Saturday’s playoff pairings. Watkins and company hopes it’s a different story than last year. \nALAH 0 6 8 6 20 \nCumberland 23 13 14 0 50 Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T11:06:33.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
