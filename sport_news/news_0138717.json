He had completed his chemotherapy in late September and had undergone scheduled post-treatment testing at Massachusetts General Hospital on Wednesday. Farrell was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's Burkitt lymphoma on Aug. 10 and took a leave of absence from the team on Aug. 14. It's expected that he'll still require much of the offseason to recover fully enough to handle the rigors of managing the Red Sox. Team president Dave Dombrowski announced just before the end of the season that Farrell would return as manager next season, health permitting. Bench coach and longtime Farrell friend Torey Lovullo took over as interim manager for the rest of the reason and will return as bench coach next season, giving up the chance to interview for managerial jobs to provide insurance should Farrell not be back to 100 percent by next spring. \"I am extremely thankful for the outpouring of support I have received from the Red Sox, my family, friends, and fans throughout this process,\" Farrell said in a statement. \"I am also especially thankful for the talented doctors who cared for me in Detroit and here at MGH.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:27:28.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
