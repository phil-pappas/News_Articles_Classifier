The time when thousands flock to their favorite hockey arena around the New England (and Indiana) to catch a Hockey East team in action. That includes the 2,226 to take in the UMass Lowell River Hawks exhibition win over the University of New Brunswick Varsity Reds on Sunday, 3-2. \nIt’s always the goal to have the higher score at the end of a hockey contest, but the ultimate goal of an exhibition game is to get the skaters onto the ice in game competition to see what works and what doesn’t work. UMass Lowell was able to accomplish both those goals. \n“It was a good start,” said UMass Lowell head coach Norm Bazin . “We got to play a lot of different players and there was several contributions from some of those players. Now we’ve got some film to analyze, so we can try and improve.” \nThe River Hawks jumped out the start at 14:09 of the first period when sophomore Jake Kamrass scored the game’s first goal. Sophomore Michael Louria added to the lead 4:10 later to give UMass Lowell a 2-0 lead heading into the second period. \nIn an exhibition game most coaches tend to play all three goaltenders to give them all a shot in net, similar to what Boston College did in their loss to New Brunswick on Saturday night. However, Bazin opted to send starter Kevin Boyle out for a second period. It is likely that Boyle gets most of the playing time this season with two freshmen behind him on the line chart. \nUNB’s Peter Trainor , UMass Lowell’s Evan Campbell and New Brunswick’s Matt Petgrave traded goals in the second and third periods, but Campbell’s goal at 6:10 of the second period would prove to be the game-winner and seal the deal for the River Hawks. \nBackup goaltender Sean Cleary made an appearance in the third period, surrendering a single goal on 14 shots. UMass Lowell played all River Hawks with the exception of third string goaltender Christoffer Hernberg and forward Gage Hough on Sunday evening. \n“It feels good, we’ve been practicing for a long time, so it’s good to get back into game systems and play with the team,” said junior co-captain Michael Kapla . \nTesting lines, matchups and exploring what to do when a man up or man down was the goal and they seemed to accomplish just that. \n“You want to play some games to get your timing back,” said Bazin. “Earlier in the game that [New Brunswick] was winning the majority of the stick battles, they were a little quicker then we were despite playing three games in four days. That just comes with playing and you have to play three or four games before you get up to game speed.” \nUMass Lowell kicks off the regular season on Friday, October 9 at the Tsongas Center against R.P.I. with a puck drop at 7:15 p.m. eastern.
