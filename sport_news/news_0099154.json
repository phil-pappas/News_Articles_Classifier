In late May, Mark Angeles was killed about a dozen blocks away.\nThe Oregon Department of Transportation, which manages Powell, later added protected left-turn signals on Southeast 26th Avenue. The agency is also devising a long term strategy for the area, Spokesman Don Hamilton said, but transportation officials prefer removing the bike lane from 26th Avenue and shifting to nearby 28th Avenue.\nAccording to the memo, Corkett had the right of way, but the legal question is whether Allen intentionally tried to cause the cyclist harm.\nUltimately, the District Attorney's Office decided \"no facts\" supported criminal charges.\n\"This tragic event is not chargeable as a felony assault,\" Banfield wrote.\nAllen, 39, was driving a 1988 Dodge pickup northbound on 26th. He was not insured to drive the vehicle.\nCyclist who lost leg in collision with vehicle speaks Alistair Stephen Corkett, 22, whose right leg was severed after a collision with a vehicle on April 10th, talked about his injury and his plans for the future in a press conference at OHSU.\nCorkett and a friend were cycling southbound on 26 th . The traffic signal was green at Powell, but Allen tried to turn left to head west on the highway. Allen appeared to hesitate when he noticed the cyclists, but Corkett said the truck then continued its turn right in front of him. Corkett said he \"broke hard and tried to avoid it, but hit the back of the truck.\"\nPolice arrived and said Allen was \"very cooperative, extremely distraught and emotional about what had happened.\"\nAllen passed all field sobriety tests. A urine test indicated he had smoked marijuana at some time, but pot can stay in urine for weeks. Officers determined Allen was not impaired or \"driving erratically or recklessly before the collision.\"\nInvestigators also said speed was not a factor, on either the cyclist or driver's part.\nIn an email to The Oregonian/OregonLive providing the memo, Banfield said the incident was a \"terrible crash that caused life altering injuries.\"\n\"Our office takes these cases particularly seriously,\" he wrote. \"Personally, I commute from Vancouver by bike almost daily throughout the year, so these cases hit very close to home for me. I have reviewed a number of vehicular cases over the years and I can tell you, no matter how many cases I review, it does not get easier to make a decision that involves such tragic and often avoidable circumstances.\"\nPortland police did cite Allen for careless driving, making a dangerous left turn and driving while uninsured. But those charges were dismissed Sept. 23, according to online court records.\n-- Andrew Theen\natheen@oregonian.com\n503-294-4026\n@cityhallwatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:12:11.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
