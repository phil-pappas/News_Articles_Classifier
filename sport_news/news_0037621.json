Forest Park (0-6, 0-3 in Region 4A- ) went through its latest coaching change in the first days of August following a winless campaign in 2014. \nBut the Vikings have prepared just as they have prior to any of their six previous games this week. On Tuesday, it found them working overtime on special teams scenarios off kickoffs just because, “one game we’ve seen them onside kick it four times,” said Northgate head coach Tommy Walburn. \nIt’s been the same methodical approach that has allowed the Vikings to dominate so far without as much as a hiccup along the way. Averaging 45.8 points and allowing a paltry 3.3 per game, Northgate wasn’t taking any chances with its preparation for the Panthers, who are allowing over 44 points to opponents. In its last two losses to Drew and Mundy’s Mill, Forest Park has been outscored 120-18. \nDespite another short week and a date with Drew (4-2, 2-1) in Clayton next Thursday, there was no skipping ahead to the next chapter this week in practice. \n“Our focus is right here on Friday night. I hope we put on a good show for our homecoming fans. The thing about a homecoming game is you’ll have people who don’t normally come to a game that will come for various reasons. So we want to play our best,” Walburn said. “Plus it’s a game that counts. All these subregion games they count the same amount as the Mundy’s Mill or the McIntosh game, which were huge wins for us.” \nThe Vikings dominated McIntosh by a 485-83 margin in total yards. In five of its six games, Northgate’s defense hasn’t given up a touchdown. \n“It wasn’t easy,” said Walburn of the McIntosh win. “The thing about McIntosh is they do as good a job with the players that they have. They’re well coached. You’re not going to just come out and straight [beat] them out of the gate. They take chances. One time we drove the ball down the field and they brought the house on our best play, the buck sweep. They hit Ton [Evans] behind the line of scrimmage. They guessed right.” \nSo far, the Vikings haven’t had to showcase its spread package, while continuing to practice it on a daily basis. \n“We’ve run it a couple of times here and there and had teams running around,” Walburn said. “We just haven’t had to use it that much so far.” More", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:48:38.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
