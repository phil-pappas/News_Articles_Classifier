A “passing” grade is mandatory to participate in Bobcat athletics. The test is drug-screening, and Burr Oak has required it of student-athletes for several years. Terry Conklin, superintendent of Burr Oak Community Schools, said the goal of the screenings is not to catch students breaking the law, but to prepare them for the future. “In the real world today, if a kid goes to get a job, they’re going to be drug tested,”Conklin said. “The other part of that is we let our student-athletes know we are holding them to a high standard.” Burr Oak is a Class D school in the Michigan High School Athletic Association, with an average of 40student-athletes each academic year. Despite the school’s smaller size and a limited number of sports offered, many larger schools in the MHSAA don’t take part in a system like Burr Oak’s. Bobcats athletic director Ryan Stephens said he would like to see more schools in the state consider drug testing. He said he agrees with Conklin that the testing should be beneficial for a student’s future. “I think drug-testing student-athletes is a policy that every district in the state of Michigan should adopt,” he said. “As a teacher and coach always trying to help my students and players make those real-world applications and connections, I applaud our school board and administration for approving and implementing this system years ago. As seen in collegiate and professional sports recently, athletes should not be placed above the system on a pedestal.” Drugs currently tested for at Burr Oak include benzodiazepines, cocaine, THC (marijuana), methamphetamine, opiates and amphetamines. Peer pressure at any level can be challenging for juveniles, Stephens said, but it can go both ways. Student-athletes can be affected by their decisions off the field or court, but also while competing. “Some students who might be tempted to use drugs because of peer influence, but will take the time to think the situation through, not only for themselves, but how it will affect their team,” Stephens said. “When student-athletes are doing this among their peers outside the school setting, then we know we are headed in the right direction.” Failure, consequences Stephens oversees the tests, which are done once before the start of the school year and also may be done on random dates. All student-athletes take the test on the same day and they are aware of the testing — both the student-athlete and the parents must sign a drug test consent form prior to the season or they are not allowed to participate. Page 2 of 2 - Failing the test can bring severe penalties. An inaugural failure results in a loss of one-fourth of the remainder of a sports season. A second positive test is an immediate loss of half a season and if someone tests positive a third time, they are banned from participation in athletics while at Burr Oak. At least one varsity student athlete interviewed is in favor of the drug testing. “I like that we do it because people who are using drugs shouldn’t be playing sports in the first place,”the athlete said. “Those of us who don’t do drugs are fine with the tests.” Stephens said that, in some cases, student-athletes may be taking medication that could show up on a positive test. He said Burr Oak is prepared for such an occurrence and if it happens, parents are immediately notified. “If a student is taking a prescription which would show up on the test as positive, I will ascertain and talk to the parents/guardians who will just bring in the prescription to show me that their child is actually taking it for medical reasons,” he said. “This is one exception we have if a student does test positive.” Push for testing John Johnson, communications director at MHSAA, said there has not been a major desire among schools to incorporate drug testing. “Drug testing, like a lot of things in high school sports, is a local issue, since schools have not desired to have any kind of state association involvement,”he said. “The only way we hear about drug testing taking place is on a purely anecdotal basis.” Stephens said when other school officials learn of what Burr Oak is doing, they are often surprised by the drug-screening process. “Most schools are shocked to hear that we drug-test our athletes, and (that) only affirms that we care about the future and welfare of our students and hold them to higher standards and expectations,” he said. It costs Burr Oaks schools between $300 and $400 per year to administer the tests, officials said.
