In South Dakota, pheasant hunting is big business. Each year, hundreds of thousands of hunters from across the country flock to the state in search of the ringneck pheasant. \nOn this day, before the season opener, a bus load of hunters from the Mitchell area traveled to Hunter's Point by Humboldt to get in some pre-season shooting. \n\"It's always great to come out and get warmed up a little bit, but sometimes you still miss, but it's a lot of fun,\" Arlen Schuh of Mitchell said. \n\"I shoot sporting clays almost year round, I like to pull the trigger, so I'm here almost on a weekly basis,\" Tom Koehn of Chamberlain said. \nKoehn was in the business of pheasant hunting for 25 years, hosting a number of hunting groups on his two farms. Oh, and he's a pretty good shot too. \nYou can shoot as many clays as you want, but ask any of these hunters and they'll tell you, there's nothing like the real thing. \nThe adrenaline rush a hunter gets when that first pheasant gets up in front of them, is what keeps a lot of people coming back year after year. \nBut will there be birds to shoot this year? \n\"It looks really good for the year Don,\" Emmett Keyser, regional supervisor for the Game, Fish, and Parks Department, said. \"We had a great nesting season this year. Good rains, good temperatures, good bug production. Of course, a good production is important to those young pheasants. That's their primary source of food throughout the growing season, crickets and everything else they eat out there,\" Keyser said. \nKeyser says the brood counts the GFP did back in late July early August, indicates pheasant numbers are up 42 percent over last year, pushing it to possibly a top-10 year. \n\"When they do those counts in August, they pretty much publish those things in national magazines, so there's always an immediate reaction to the birds being up or down,\" Koehn said. \nBut a lot hunters, including this group will tell you hunting pheasants in South Dakota is about more than just shooting birds. It's about getting together and sharing stories and memories and a few jokes before the shooting even begins. \n\"It's great camaraderie, a lot of fun,\" Schuh said. \n\"I think the camaraderie with the groups, pheasant hunting is kind of a traditional sport in South Dakota and the big groups getting together every year and having fun and everybody looks forward to that,\" Koehn said. \nIf you are planning to go hunting, Keyser offers a bit of advice to those who are anxious to get out and walk the fields, especially the 1.3-million acres of public walk in. \n\"Best to stay home, don't even bother going out until 3 or 4 o'clock and hit some of those grassy areas on public land that'll be open this weekend, I think they'll find birds there late in the day,\" Keyser said. \nKeyser also attributes an increase in pheasant numbers to the governor's task force that looked at ways to increase pheasant habitat. One way is through a program called Habitat Pays which helps landowners develop and fund wildlife habitat. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
