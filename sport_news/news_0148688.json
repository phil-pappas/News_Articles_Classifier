They're comparing it with the money people are spending, but it's the same thing. You don't realise it until you see it and it's really useful for me in managing my time a bit better.\" \nDespite suffering an ankle ligament injury which prevented him defending his Open Championship title at St Andrews, McIlroy had just 18 full days off in 2015 and spent 287 nights away from home. \nThe 26-year-old still managed to hit 16,500 balls, do 6,800 press-ups, 6,320 pull-ups and spent 6,720 minutes stretching, a massive change from the year of his first major victory in 2011. \n:::Santander Spendlytics is an innovative iOS app which tells customers how much they spend on their debit and credit cards - download from here https://appsto.re/gb/n4_z6.I Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T11:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:50:03.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
