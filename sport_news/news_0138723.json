(AP)\nChicago — Daniel Murphy homered in a record-tying fifth straight post-season game Tuesday to help the New York Mets beat the Chicago Cubs, 5-2, and move within one win of a World Series berth.\nYoenis Cespedes scored a go-ahead run on a wild pitch in the sixth inning and added two runs-batted-in for the Mets, who took a commanding 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven National League Championship Series.\nThe Cubs, seeking their first World Series title since 1908 and their first appearance in 70 years, will try to fend off elimination when they host Game 4 on Wednesday, when the Mets will be trying to book a return to Major League Baseball’s title showcase for the first time in 15 years.\nMets starting pitcher Jacob deGrom improved to 3-0 in the post-season after working seven strong innings and was feeling confident.\n“Hopefully we can win it tomorrow and get some days off heading into the World Series,” he said.\nThe Boston Red Sox, in the 2004 American League Championship Series, are the only team to erase an 0-3 deficit to win a seven-game series, getting past the New York Yankees on their way to ending their own World Series drought.\n“Of course you think about those things, you think about the parallels, think about the fact that that happened against a New York team,” Cubs manager Joe Maddon said.\n”We think about all that stuff, but it’s up to us to go out and play and execute.”", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:54:14.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
