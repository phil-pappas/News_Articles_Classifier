WEXLER/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Mets free-agent-to-be Daniel Murphy's postseason power surge has grabbed the attention of teams looking for hitting and one of them could be the Yankees. Any Yankee-centric person – executive, player, even an observant fan – was able to recognize the signature on Daniel Murphy’s home run off Jake Arrieta on Sunday night. Sure, it was a backbreaker for the Cubs, putting them in a 3-0 hole in the first inning. And it wrote Murphy’s name in the franchise’s record book – he’s the only Met to ever hit five home runs in a single postseason, putting him ahead of Mike Piazza, Carlos Delgado and Rusty Staub.\nBut there’s more to this than just a history lesson. Murphy’s blast was really just a curl shot around the right-field foul pole, the kind that’s perfectly tailored for Yankee Stadium. That’s what makes Murphy’s playoff run is so intriguing. Not only is he hoisting the Mets toward the World Series, but he’s made himself attractive to teams looking for home run power, and that includes the Yankees.\nWould they sign him? Could they? It’s too early to know. The club has begun only this week to form its off-season plans; there’s no budget in place. It’s impossible to know whom the Yankees will chase and how much they have to spend.\nBut don’t think Murphy’s assets have gone unnoticed in the Bronx. Thanks to Kevin Long’s mentoring, Murphy has a distinct uppercut in his swing and looks to pull everything. That hook drive off Arrieta? Murphy could hit 25 of those in the Bronx, which would make him worth the $10 million to $12 million per season he’ll be looking for in the open market, probably for three years.\nThe question, of course, is where Murphy would fit. He’s not exactly a DH, nor is he athletic enough to be trusted at second base every day. The only place Murphy could help the Yankees is at third base, but only if they were willing and able to trade Chase Headley.\nThere’s no indication the Bombers are ready to give up on Headley, despite a mediocre season. He posted a .693 OPS, the second-lowest of his career, and committed a career-high 23 errors, the most in the majors among third basemen.\nMurphy probably could hide at third base without embarrassing himself. If nothing else, he’d be the best insurance policy the Mets could buy if and when David Wright’s back regresses.\nSo why aren’t the Mets jumping at the chance to sign Murphy? His hot streak isn’t just limited to October; since Aug. 1, Murphy has a .533 slugging percentage, which puts him in the company of the game’s elite. And Murphy isn’t just hitting, he’s squaring up on the game’s best pitchers, blasting homers off Clayton Kershaw, Zack Greinke, Jon Lester and Arrieta.\nAgain, why aren’t the Mets falling over themselves to keep Murphy in Flushing, knowing there’s a risk he might end up in the Bronx?\nTwo reasons: They love Dilson Herrera’s upside, just as much as they’re impressed with Wilmer Flores’ power. Either one, they believe, can inherit the position from Murphy in 2016.\nThe second reason is financial, naturally. The Mets are committed to Michael Cuddyer and Juan Lagares into next season, which means some of the money they might’ve spent on Murphy already is tied up. And whatever discretionary revenue they divert toward Murphy would be subtracted from the war chest the Mets plan to offer Yoenis Cespedes.\nIt’s a zero-sum game with the Wilpons. Despite the surplus of cash from postseason ticket sales, there’s no indication the payroll will increase significantly from its current $100 million. If Murphy goes, it’s because the Mets would not, and could not, afford him.\nNEWS ITEM: Mets look to Jacob deGrom closing in on sweep \nJoe Maddon did his best to sound upbeat about the Cubs’ chances after their 4-1 loss in Game 2, but he hardly sounded convincing.\nMaddon is smart enough to realize the Mets have beaten his two best pitchers, Lester and Arrieta, and he has to rely on Kyle Hendricks and Jason Hammel as the last line of defense against an embarrassing sweep.\nThe Cubs are a fine team; their 97 regular-season wins speak to their overall trajectory and bright future. And their takedown of the Cardinals, the NL’s best team, was epic. Hitting 10 home runs against St. Louis should’ve worried the Mets.\nBut ESPN.com came up with a revealing stat that explains why the Cubs so far have collapsed. Their hitters have seen 103 pitches at 95 mph or faster in the NLCS. Mets hitters have seen three.\nAnd it’s not just velocity that sets the Mets pitchers apart, as explained by one talent evaluator.\n“They’re throwing 98 on the black; it’s like they never miss their spots,” the scout said. “It’s very unusual to see young, hard throwers with that much precision. Most of the time, guys with that much [velocity] have no idea where the ball is going. I don’t see that with deGrom or [Noah] Syndergaard or [Matt] Harvey. These guys are obviously well-coached.”\nIt’s too early to start matching up the Mets with an AL opponent, but just for fun, we asked the same talent evaluator to handicap a Fall Classic that involved the Mets.\n“I don’t think Toronto can beat them, even with that offense,” he said. “Kansas City is a different story. That’s the one team that can match the Mets. That’s a very tough ballclub.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:20:54.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
