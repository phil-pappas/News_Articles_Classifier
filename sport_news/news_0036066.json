Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports) \nMANSFIELD â€” For all of his accomplishments in the majors leagues, including two Cy Young Awards and 55 wins in back-to-back seasons, Denny McLain never threw a perfect game. \nHe did, however, deliver a perfect eulogy for Dean Chance. \nChance, one of McLain's dearest friends, died Sunday morning at age 74. The area legend and arguably greatest schoolboy pitcher ever in Ohio was found unresponsive in his farmhouse not far from his boyhood home outside of Wooster. \n\"For two years (1963 and 1964) I thought he was the best pitcher I ever saw in the big leagues ... the best pitcher I ever saw in my life,\" McLain, the last major-leaguer to win 30 games in a season, said in a phone interview with the Mansfield News Journal. \"He had something really unique. He had a great fastball. It was heavy ... it was like a five-pound rock he was throwing at you. If you didn't get the head of the bat on that you were going to hurt your hand. You were going to get stung. He was devastating for those two years. He was unbelievable.\" \nIn 1963, his second full season in the majors, Chance's 13-18 record did not come close to reflecting his mastery on the mound. He lost 13 games by shutout. His Los Angeles Angels scored 21 runs in his 18 losses. He threw two shutouts, allowed only 10 home runs in 248 innings and saved three games. But his salary didn't budge off the $18,000 he was already getting. \nSo Chance pitched angry in 1964, venting his frustration in the form of a 20-9 mark with a franchise-record 1.65 ERA. He led the league in innings pitched with 278, tossed 15 complete games, threw 11 shutouts, struck out 207, allowed only seven home runs and even saved four games. \nAt 23, he became the youngest Cy Young winner in history, a mark that would stand until Dwight Gooden won the award as baseball's best pitcher for the New York Mets in 1985 at 20. \nMcLain, who won Cy Youngs in 1968 and 1969 when he was 31-6 and 24-9 for the Detroit Tigers, couldn't recall how many times they dueled. He said Chance was the stats savant with the photographic memory. \n\"He remembered how many times Gene Michael (a weak-hitting shortstop for the New York Yankees) got a hit off me!\" McLain said. \"I think the only reason I had more wins was because he played with the worst ballclub I've ever seen. \n\"Every time you faced Dean you knew it was going to be a 1-0 or 2-1 ball game, so when you went out there every pitch was full of intensity,\" McLain said. \"The good news was Dean was an automatic out. The only way he could get a hit is if you hit his bat.\" \nMcLain could commiserate with his buddy over lack of support. McLain remembers getting shut out eight times when he was 10-22 for the Washington Senators in 1971. \n\"We would laugh about that,\" McLain said. \"We were always saying 'Think about if we were on a good team, on and on ... I told him to forget all that bull(crap). We wouldn't have to be on a good team if we were playing today. All you have to do is stick around for four years and they'll give you $12 million because that's what everybody else is making. \n\"But one thing Dean didn't need was money. He went out of here with his boots high.\" \nMcLain and Chance would get together for a meal several times a year whenever McLain's travels would bring him to north central Ohio. \n\"I've lost 184 pounds, so when I'd meet him the last couple of years I could put a piece of bread in my mouth and I'm full for the next six hours,\" McLain said. \"We would sit down and have lunch and the bill would be $60 or $70. I'd be like, what the ... how can the bill be this much? He said, 'We ordered everything and you didn't eat anything.' I said, 'Listen, there's nothing on those plates; somebody ate all this.' Man, he could eat.\" \nChance's heart was as big as his appetite. He never lost touch with his roots and always gave back to his native Wayne County. He was director of the Roy Bates Foundation, created by his former Northwestern High School coach. Over the last 22 years, the Bates Foundation has given out more than $270,000 to Wayne County high school seniors. \nMcLain remembers the two of them making an appearance together a couple of years ago. He said Chance spent a half-hour talking to about 50 kids about pitching. \n\"Listen, I can't say this about anybody else: I loved the man; I literally loved him,\" McLain said. \"He did me some monster favors, helped me in some difficult situations. \n\"He loved the game of baseball. He wanted to pitch the rest of his life. So did all of us. One way or another, he pitched every day of his life, he really did.\" \njspencer@nncogannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:26:55.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
