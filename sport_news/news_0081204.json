He had been battling a knee injury. \n“The injuries and challenges I have overcome the last few years have taken away my love for playing the game of football,” Shepard said in a news release. “I will always love this team and cheer them on as they compete for a championship. I want to especially thank (Rebels head) Coach (Hugh) Freeze for showing me what unconditional love is like.” \nShepard joined the Rebels last year as a transfer from Holmes Community College in Goodman, but tore a tendon in his toe that kept him out for the 2014 season. The former four-star recruit was the No. 1 cornerback and No. 18 juco player overall, according to 247Sports’ Composite Rating. \nHe committed to Mississippi State days before National Signing Day before flipping to the Rebels. \n“I probably could’ve convinced him to stay with it,” Freeze said. “His heart wasn’t really in the grind that this presents to you right now. He’s had to overcome a lot of injuries. We love Tee. We’ll continue to support him as he gets his degree.” \nShepard will remain on scholarship and is expected to graduate in May. \nThe Fresno, California, resident has battled hearing loss his entire life and didn’t begin using hearing aids until he joined the Rebels. Freeze said Monday that Shepard’s partial deafness impacted him during last Saturday’s 38-10 road loss to Florida. \n“He’s really struggled in getting the checks,” Freeze said. “In that kind of environment, they used a lot of shifts and a lot of motion. A lot of teams have been doing that to us. When they do that, we have to make a check, and that is very difficult for him. With the games that we are playing, it’s much easier to play at home than on the road. That is an issue for him. \n“While all of us hate that, there is part of that to it. If there is any short motion or shift, he has to look back to see it. And when you turn around, all of a sudden, the ball is snapped. So that has been an issue for us. It has nothing to do with his physical skills. \n“We’re thinking about all the possibilities to try to get him to have success. I had a long meeting with him to figure out how we can do this and make it to where you are successful and be on the same page as everyone. We’re looking into everything that we can.” \nThe Rebels will likely turn to junior Carlos Davis; junior Kailo Moore, who Freeze described as “probably out” for Saturday’s game; and true freshman Cam Ordway, who the Rebels were hoping to redshirt this season, to fill Shepard’s spot. \n“We’re taking the approach (Ordway’s) going to play,” Rebels defensive coordinator Dave Wommack said Tuesday, “but we don’t want to use him unless we have to use him.” \nContact Daniel Paulling at dpaulling@jackson.gannett.com.
