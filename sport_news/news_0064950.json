Now I am used to it. Obviously, I'm doing it to make the program more (difficult) and get more points.\" \nFor Gold it was a frustrating start to a season aimed at the World Championships in her native Boston next March. \nThe American opened her sophisticated tango with a soaring combination but doubled an intended triple flip to earn no points for the element — a flub that likely cost her the lead. \n\"I've just been working a lot on the timing of the three turns, trying to get an inside edge, and I lost a bit of my attention,\" said Gold, whose 65.39 points gave her just a slim advantage over Miyahara (65.12.). \n\"I still feel really solid in the start of the Grand Prix season and I want to do a killer long tomorrow.\" \nMiyahara delivered a flamenco that included an impressive layback, but she under-rotated her triple flip. \n\"I think this performance was better than last time,\" she said, adding that she'd improved her presentation since the U.S. International Classic last month. \"I've been working on my facial (expressions) and also my speed. I am happy with my program today.\" \nAaron Surprise Men's Leader \nA home hope was in control in the men's competition after 2013 U.S. champion Max Aaron — who just missed out on a 2014 Sochi Olympics berth — landed all of his jumps, including a quadruple toe loop in combination, to lead after the short program. \n\"I've been waiting for it to happen,\" Aaron said after posting a personal best score of 86.67 points to lead China's Yan Han (86.53) and Russian Konstantin Menshov (86.15). \nJapan's world junior champion Shoma Uno and world bronze medalist Denis Ten of Kazakhstan both fell on quadruple attempts, Uno settling for fourth place and Ten for sixth going into the decisive free skate. \nReigning U.S. champions Alexa Scimeca and Chris Knierim were the surprise leaders after the pairs short program. \nNo U.S. pair has won a Grand Prix event since 2006, but the duo's intense program to Metallica's \"Nothing Else Matters\" gave them a personal best 69.69 points and a 1.41-point lead over China's Sui Wenjing and Han Cong (68.28). \nChina's Wang Xuehan and Wang Lei were third on 64.95. \nAmericans Madison Chock and Evan Bates led after the short dance, ahead of Russians Victoria Sinitsina and Nikita Katsalapov with Canadians Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier in third.
