The Capitals won 2-0. (AP Photo/Nick Wass) \nARLINGTON, Va. — Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin returned to practice Wednesday after missing Tuesday’s game for personal reasons. The Capitals fell 5-0 to the San Jose Sharks in their most lopsided defeat at home since a 5-0 loss to the Dallas Stars on April 1, 2014. \nJason Chimera was absent from practice Wednesday and is considered day-to-day with a lower-body injury. Chimera fell awkwardly into the Sharks’ net midway through the third period and appeared to be favoring his left leg as he skated back to the bench. Chimera took a regular shift after the incident and led the Capitals with six shots on goal. \nBoth Ovechkin and Chimera had a goal and an assist in Washington’s 5-3 win against New Jersey in the season opener last Saturday. \nThe Capitals (1-1-0) continue their season-opening, four-game homestand on Thursday as they face the defending Stanley Cup Champion Chicago Blackhawks. The Blackhawks will be playing their second game in as many nights following their matchup with the Philadelphia Flyers Wednesday.
