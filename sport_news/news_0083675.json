Atkins interviewed for the Angels' GM job last month. \nWhen he dismissed Ruben Amaro Jr. last month, MacPhail said he planned to run a thorough search to fill the GM position and thought it would be \"ambitious\" to have a hire in place before the Phillies' organizational meetings at the end of the month. So this is likely just the beginning of that process. \nOther potential candidates include Matt Klentak, who worked as an assistant GM with the Angels in 2015, J.J. Picollo, as assistant GM with Kansas City, and Thad Levine, an assistant GM with the Texas Rangers. \n- Ryan Lawrence", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:42:41.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
