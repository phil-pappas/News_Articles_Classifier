So now, I'm asking for prayers.\"\nHe said he learned of the growth earlier in the season, after the Blue Jays had sent him back to Triple-A Buffalo, prior to the Tigers acquiring him at the trade deadline. He said after several tests, the growth was diagnosed as malignant.\n\"Hearing this was alarming, yeah. Weird, yea, that too,\" he wrote. \"I was given the option to shut my year down and get it removed immediately. However, seeing another doctor that determined I could wait until the end of the season reassured my gut feeling. Just Keep Playing.\n\"Baseball kept me sane. Regardless of results on the field, I forgot about it when I was between the lines. After all, I was just trying to get the heck out of AAA.\"\nThe Tigers made that happen for him and he finished the year, despite being sidelined for three weeks with an oblique strain.\n\"I was revived with an opportunity, a blessing from God, with the Tigers back in the Big Leagues,\" he wrote. \"So yea, the power of prayer.. It got me through this season. Now that it's over it's time to get this thing out, so please keep me in your thoughts and prayers as I undergo surgery and come out 100 percent cancer free!\"\nDetails of the surgery were not immediately known.\nTigers general manager Al Avila said the team was aware of Norris' condition before making the trade. He is expected to make a full recovery.\nI've been debating for months as to how or even if I should share this with people. - I'm a firm believer in the power of prayer. So now, I'm asking for prayers. - A few months ago, after I was optioned to AAA, I found out I had a growth on my thyroid. Flying back & forth from Toronto to Buffalo after pitching to have more and more tests done it was finally concluded that the growth is considered malignant.. Meaning it contained the C word.. cancer. Hearing this was alarming, yea. Weird, yea, that too. I was given the option to shut my year down & get it removed immediately. However, seeing another doctor that determined I could wait until the end of the season reassured my gut feeling. Just Keep Playing. Baseball kept me sane. Regardless of results on the field, I forgot about it when I was between the lines. Afterall, I was just trying to get the heck out of AAA. & I did. I was revived with an opportunity, a blessing from God, with the Tigers back in the Big Leagues. So yea, the power of prayer.. It got me through this season. Now that it's over it's time to get this thing out, so please keep me in your thoughts & prayers as I undergo surgery & come out 100% cancer free!
