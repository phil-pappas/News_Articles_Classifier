Listed at 6’7’’ (but seeming even taller in person), Memphis quarterback Paxton Lynch stands out wherever he goes, and he’ll need to do that and more if the Tigers are going to upset rival Ole Miss. \nLynch has taken dramatic strides every year on campus at Memphis. He looked lost at times during his true freshman season, a challenging endeavor that saw the team go 3-9 and rank as one of the worst offenses in the country at 24.4 points per game, but head coach Justin Fuente stuck with him, and it paid off almost immediately. >> Read More Trending Stories \nLynch was much-improved as a sophomore in 2014, throwing for 22 touchdowns (against 9 interceptions) and a completion percentage that climbed over 62%. The Tigers turned heads on the national scene, winning 10 games and compiling one of their best years in program history. \nAs a junior, Lynch has been one of the best in the country through five games this fall. He’s completing 70.5% of his passes, and has already thrown for 10 touchdowns without a single pick. \nThe Ole Miss defense is probably the most talented that the Tigers will face all season. Led by Robert Nkemdiche, the Rebels had three All-SEC selections on the defensive end, and will bring a unit to the Liberty Bowl that ranks 31st in scoring defense (19.7 points per game). \nBut they’re hardly unbeatable. Against the two best offenses they’ve faced this season, Ole Miss was gauged for 37 and 38 points against Alabama and Florida. They’ve turned opponents over at a decent clip (12 forced), but nine have been interceptions (which, again, Lynch has none of this fall). \nTiger fans and college football fanatics in general will get an answer one way or another about one of the most explosive offenses in the country. Memphis stands out at 4th in the country, lighting opponents up for over 47 points per game. And they’ll probably need to increase that average, as the Rebels rank right behind them at No. 5. Are the Tigers a product of scheduling, or can this group score with anyone? \nPaxton Lynch has the chance to create a legacy for himself at Memphis and on the national scene. He’s already turning the heads of pro scouts, and could very well have the chance to be an early-round selection if he leaves school early after his junior year. Put up prolific numbers against an SEC rival, and his legend will be told years from now. Beat the top 15 Rebels, and everyone around the country will be forced to respect Memphis’ body of work. \nTigers head coach Justin Fuente has been adamant about reminding fans and media that this Saturday represents one game in a long season, and in many ways he’s right. Lose to Ole Miss, and the Tigers can still win their division, win a conference title, and put up another year to remember. But if Lynch can lead the Tigers to their first win over an SEC team since 2004, it’ll put him and the program on the map like never before. \nFollow FOX13's Peter Fleischer on Twitter and Facebook Connect: FOX 13 on Social Media & Mobile Twitter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:35:54.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
