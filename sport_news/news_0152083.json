I’m just looking forward to it.”\nAn adrenaline-fuelled one-game home stand could be just what they need to get them right before they head out for back-to-back games in Calgary and Vancouver.\nOr they could fall to 0-4 — the Blues are no easy mark, after all — and dig their early hole just a little bit deeper.\n“I don’t know what the answer is to that question.” said McLellan, when asked if a return to Edmonton will generate the necessary response.\n“We’re going home, we’re going to see. It’ll be interesting. This is what I talked about in training camp, about holding your hand a little bit longer and not folding your cards. We’ll see.”\nWhile the Oilers battled hard in Nashville and St. Louis but lost because of isolated glaring mistakes and a total lack of offence, there was nothing close or competitive about the loss to Dallas. It was the kind of game McLellan has vowed to eliminate, but it looks like that might take a little more time that he anticipated.\n“The performance and the preparation was disheartening,” he said. “The record is going to continue to be (losing) if they approach the game that way.”\nElements of the game he’s been trying stress from his first meeting were nowhere to be found on a lot of fronts.\n“They (the McDavid line) go down and have a great opportunity to get the lead and they come back the other way and, I’m not talking about Connor, but we miss assignments coming back in.\n“We’ve worked on that since Day 1 of training camp and the winning goal is scored in that situation.”\nMcLellan wasn’t happy with some of this top guns, either. Taylor Hall and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins didn’t generate much of anything on the trip (generating one point, the St. Louis own goal credited to Nugent-Hopkins, and going a combined minus 5).\n“I think they’re better than what we’ve seen,” he said. “I thought Benn and Seguin and Sharp and Spezza and that group performed at a very high level and I thought our guys were OK, but they have to take it to another level.”\nFollow me on twitter.com/sun_tychkowski\nrobert.tychkowski@sunmedia.ca\nAfter a winless season-opening road trip, the Oilers look to turn game around for home opener\nBy Robert Tychkowski , Edmonton Sun First posted: Wednesday, October 14, 2015 06:08 PM EDT | Updated: Wednesday, October 14, 2015 08:51 PM EDT\nThe Edmonton Oilers won’t be home for long, but they’re definitely longing for home.\nAfter a three-game road trip that got worse with every stop, culminating in a stinker that brought back chilling memories of the Dallas Eakins era, they will try again for their first win of the season at Thursday’s Rexall Place home opener.\nAfter losing 3-1 in St. Louis, 2-0 in Nashville and mailing in a 4-2 defeat in Dallas that head coach Todd McLellan could only shake his head at in disbelief (the 52-28 shot total still doesn’t make sense), the opportunity to regroup in front of their own fans comes just in time.\n“I’m looking forward to going home,” said rookie centre Connor McDavid, who’s been waiting over a week for something to good to happen, and couldn’t even really enjoy the first goal of his career given that it came in such a miserable loss.\n“Any time you have a home opener like that it’s going to be special, the fans are going to be great.
