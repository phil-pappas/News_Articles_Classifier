The Action TrackChair will be given to Amarillo resident Petty Officer 3rd Class Chris Bradley at the Amarillo VFW 1401 SW 8th Ave, Amarillo, TX 79101 on Wednesday, Oct. 28 at 6 p.m. This is the fourteenth chair Freedom Alliance has donated to a deserving veteran. This event is open to the public.\nBradley served in the Navy for six years and was deployed to Kuwait, Iraq then back to stations in the United States before medically retiring in Amarillo in 2009. He is currently receiving treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, a traumatic brain injury as well as physical combat-related injuries. Due to his periodic paralysis, he now uses a wheelchair most of the time.\nHe loves to fish and hike with his family but has not been able to as much recently. The Action TrackChair will allow him, despite lower body impairments, the ability to safely enjoy and maneuver the outdoors once again.\n“Chris Bradley is an American hero who served our country on multiple deployments sustaining injuries that would ail him for years to come,” said Kilgannon. “For his service and great sacrifice Freedom Alliance would like to offer him this chair as a small token of our appreciation. We hope it brings him comfort and the ability to enjoy nature and his favorite activities more easily.”\nBradley currently lives in Amarillo with his wife Kayla and their three young children, as well as their service dog Sadie who helps him cope with PTSD.\nIn addition to Trackchair donations, Freedom Alliance has provided $9 million in college scholarships for the children of military heroes who were killed or disabled in military service, and millions more to help wounded troops and military families with outdoor recreation therapy such as hunting and fishing trips, Heroes Vacations, care packages for deployed troops, refurbished homes and much more.\nPrevious Trackchair donation information found at: https://freedomalliance.org/highlights/marine-amputee-receives-all-terrain-trackchair\\ .\nMedia should RSVP to Donnie Gallagher of Vistra Communications by phone at 813.321.3314 or by email to DonnieG(at)ConsultVistra(dot)com.\nAbout Freedom Alliance\nCelebrating its 25th anniversary in 2015, Freedom Alliance is a charitable organization which provides help and support to wounded troops and military families.
