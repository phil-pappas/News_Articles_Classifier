Filmed over 211 shoot days in nine countries and five continents over four years, \"This Changes Everything\" is an epic attempt to re-imagine the vast challenge of climate change. Inspired by Naomi Kleins international non-fiction bestseller This Changes Everything, the film presents seven powerful portraits of communities on the front lines, from Montanas Powder River Basin to the Alberta Tar Sands, from the coast of South India to Beijing and beyond. Interwoven with these stories of struggle is Kleins narration, connecting the carbon in the air with the economic system that put it there. Throughout the film, Klein builds to her most controversial and exciting idea: that we can seize the existential crisis of climate change to transform our failed economic system into something radically better.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T10:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:37:05.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
