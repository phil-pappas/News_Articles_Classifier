Tech upsets No. 9 Florida State 1  /  1 Back to Gallery Atlanta \nLance Austin returned a blocked field goal 78 yards for a touchdown on the final play of the game, giving Georgia Tech a stunning 22-16 upset of No. 9 Florida State on Saturday night.\nRoberto Aguayo , one of the most accurate kickers in the country, attempted a 56-yard field goal to win the game for the Seminoles (6-1, 4-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) with 6 seconds remaining. But the kick was low, and Rod Rook-Chuncong managed to get a hand on it.\nWhile most of the Georgia Tech players celebrated, Austin went back to retrieve the ball, rolling along inside the 25-yard line.\nAt first, he seemed hesitant to pick it up. But then he did, taking off the other way in front of the Georgia Tech bench. He avoided Aguayo's diving attempt, then cut back on the final guy who had a shot at him to win the game for Georgia Tech (3-5, 1-4).\nUSC 42, Utah 24: Cameron Smith returned the second of his three interceptions 54 yards for a touchdown, and Southern California knocked No. 3 Utah from the unbeaten ranks. Ronald Jones II , Justin Davis and fullback Soma Vainuku rushed for scores to help the Trojans (4-3, 2-2 Pac-12) snap their two-game skid and earn a victory for interim coach Clay Helton in his debut game at the Coliseum. Cody Kessler passed for 264 yards and a touchdown and rushed for another score, while JuJu Smith-Schuster had eight catches for 143 yards and a fourth-quarter TD that wrapped up the win.\nOklahoma State 58, Kansas 10: Backup quarterback J.W. Walsh ran for three touchdowns and passed for two more scores to help No. 14 Oklahoma State beat Kansas on Saturday, hours after a fatal crash near the stadium during homecoming festivities. Four people — including a toddler — were killed and dozens injured when a woman suspected of driving under the influence plowed a car into a crowd at the homecoming parade. Oklahoma State considered postponing the game, but in the end, opted to go ahead with it. The flag at Boone Pickens Stadium was lowered to half-staff and Cowboys players knelt down on the field and prayed before the coin toss. Mason Rudolph completed 20 of 26 passes for 305 yards and had a touchdown for Oklahoma State (7-0, 4-0 Big 12). \nOhio State 49, Rutgers 7: J.T. Barrett threw three touchdown passes and ran for two scores in his first start of the season, leading No. 1 Ohio State to a victory against Rutgers and ensuring at least two weeks of quarterback stability for the Buckeyes. Ohio State (8-0, 4-0 Big Ten) extended its winning streak to 21 games, best in the nation, and heads into its off week with no doubt who the starting QB will be when Minnesota comes to Columbus on Nov. 7 \nBaylor 45, Iowa State 27: Shock Linwood ran for 171 yards and a touchdown, caught a pass for another score and No. 2 Baylor beat Iowa State for its FBS-best 20th consecutive home victory.

Leonard Fournette ran for 150 yards and a short touchdown on a soggy field, giving him 1,352 yards rushing and 15 TDs this season. The Hilltoppers (6-2) were as close as 17-13 on Brandon Doughty's 39-yard touchdown pass to Antwane Grant in the third quarter, but LSU (7-0) scored the next 17 points.\nMichigan State 52, Indiana 26: Connor Cook threw for 398 yards and four touchdowns for No. 7 Michigan State. Cook fell just short of the school record of 400 yards passing, set by Bill Burke in 1999 against Michigan. The Spartans (8-0, 4-0 Big Ten) never trailed in the second half, but it was touch and go until Cook found R.J. Shelton for a 10-yard touchdown pass with 4:57 left for a 12-point lead. The Spartans then tacked on two more touchdowns to avoid an upset.\nAlabama 19, Tennessee 14: Derrick Henry had a 14-yard touchdown run with 2:24 left to lift No. 8 Alabama past Tennessee. Alabama's aggressive defense then made two straight sacks and Ryan Anderson knocked the ball loose from Joshua Dobbs to preserve the victory. Alabama (7-1, 4-1 Southeastern Conference) got plenty of help, with Tennessee (3-4, 1-3) missing three long field goals.\nOklahoma 63, Texas Tech 27 : Samaje Perine ran for 201 yards and four touchdowns and helped Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield top his old team.

Mayfield completed 15 of 22 passes for 212 yards and two touchdowns. Joe Mixon ran for 154 yards and two scores, and the Sooners (6-1, 3-1 Big 12) ran for 405 yards.\nToledo 51, Massachusetts 35: Phillip Ely threw four of his five touchdown passes in the second half and No. 19 Toledo overcame an 18-point deficit to beat Massachusetts. Ely completed 26 of 47 passes for 355 yards, with three interceptions in the first half. The Rockets (7-0, 4-0 Mid-American) are off to their best start since 1997. Terry Swanson ran 21 times for 117 yards and a score for the Rockets.\nHouston 59, UCF 10: Kenneth Farrow ran for 167 yards and three touchdowns and No. 21 Houston beat Central Florida to remain undefeated. The Cougars (7-0, 4-0 American Athletic) scored 24 points in a mid-game span of 31/2 minutes and won for the fifth time by 21 points or more. Houston cornerback Brandon Wilson scored on an 85-yard fumble return on the third play of the game.\nDuke 45, Virginia Tech 43 (4 OT): Thomas Sirk threw four touchdown passes and ran for a 2-point conversion in the fourth overtime to lift No. 23 Duke past Virginia Tech. Sirk hit Erich Schneider with a 25-yard scoring pass on the first play of the fourth overtime, after the Hokies had scored and missed the mandatory 2-point attempt. Sirk rolled right and cut upfield, giving the Blue Devils (6-1, 3-0) the victory in the longest game in Atlantic Coast Conference history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:36:33.779+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
