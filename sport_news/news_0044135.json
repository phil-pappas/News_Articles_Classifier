Posted: Thursday, October 8, 2015 9:59 pm | Updated: 10:15 pm, Thu Oct 8, 2015. MUNFORD -- The 2015 season has been a roller coaster for Munford’s high school football team. The Lions have won some games in exciting fashion, but they have also dropped several heartbreakers. Munford enters the final three games of the season with a chance to reach the playoffs. If the Lions are going to earn a trip to the postseason for the fourth year in a row, they will have to pick up some wins starting Friday night against county foe Childersburg at Munford Stadium. Kickoff is set for 7. “We have left ourselves with little room for error,” Munford head coach Bill Smith said. “We need to go ahead and win this game. We are not taking Childersburg for granted at all. … We (are facing) a team that has to win their next two games to be 3-3 and make the playoffs. We know that we are going to get Childersburg’s best shot.” Childersburg (2-4, 1-2) still has a chance to make the postseason with three region games remaining. The Tigers will have to win out or win two of three games against Munford, Leeds and Elmore County to make the postseason. Childersburg head coach Adam Fossett said his team is only worried about the things that it can control. “The playoff picture is pretty fuzzy right now with our region because everybody seems to be beating everybody else,” Fossett said. “It is going to be interesting how it plays out. ... We can’t worry about what other teams do and we can’t depend on other region opponents to help us out.” Avery Harris accounted for three touchdowns in the fourth quarter to help Munford (4-3, 2-2) defeat region foe and No. 10-ranked Dadeville 26-12 last week. Dadeville was the third Top 10 team the Lions have defeated this season. The Lions are known for their high-powered offense, but it was their defense that was the difference last week. After missing the last few games due to injury, Austin Stephens returned for the Lions and made his presence felt as he recorded 13 tackles. “I feel like our defense, once we got Austin Stephens back healthy, have played a lot better,” Smith said. “He was full speed this week, and I think our confidence level on defense goes up when he is full speed and getting guys in position. “I know he had a 13-tackle game and our secondary is much improved. … I was proud of the way we finished the game, especially on defense. Offensively, we didn’t play well in the third quarter, but we were able to score 19 points in the fourth.” Childersburg defeated Holtville 52-20 last week for homecoming. The Tigers enter Friday's game knowing that they may have to put together another high-scoring outing against a Munford team that averages 36.4 points per game. “It was a big win for us last week,” Fossett said. “Obviously, it was a region win and it was homecoming, so that was big for us. Everybody is healthy for us coming off the win, so that is big. “We are in one-game-at-a-time mode; we are not looking ahead. We have respect for the athletic ability of Munford and what they have accomplished this year. It is important that we go and play assignment football. We can’t have mistakes and missed assignments. “It is going to be important for us to get a rhythm on offense and move the ball because they are going to move the ball and score a lot of points. It is going to be important that we score some points as well.” The Lions didn’t turn the football over against Dadeville last week, and Smith said he believes his team will need another turnover-free game if it is going to defeat Childersburg. “We preach ball security, we practice ball security,” Smith said. “The past couple of weeks, every day we have done ball security drills, so we hope that continues to play big dividends for us.” Fossett said Childersburg is going to have contain Munford’s dual threat quarterback -- Harris -- if it is going to have a chance to leave Munford with a victory. “We are going to have to execute,” Fossett said. “We are going to have to keep up with their pace, we are going to have to finish drives and put points on the board. Offensively, for them, we have to contain the quarterback and keep him limited on big plays, because he is a big time playmaker.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:28:00.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
