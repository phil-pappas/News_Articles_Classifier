Night Shyamalan is returning to the house!\nThe Blumhouse.\nAfter finding box-office success with his low-budget thriller \"The Visit,\" M. Night will reteam with low-budget thriller producer Jason Blum for an untitled project to star James McAvoy , Betty Buckley , Anya Taylor Joy , Jessica Sula and Haley Lu Richardson .\nVariety reports that M. Night will write and direct. He'll co-produce with the busy Blum and Marc Bienstock .\nMore coverage Cops: Wiz Khalifa cited for public urination in Pittsburgh Amber Rose cancels upcoming reality show Plot details remain secret, Variety said, but the film will likely include elements of the supernatural.\nProduction is expected to start this November right here in Philadelphia.\nA Swift kick When Tattle woke this morning, one of the top stories on our non-news feed was that Taylor Swift had kicked boyfriend Calvin Harris to the curb because she caught him going to a Thai massage parlor.\nThe implication was that Harris had enjoyed some backroom business and that Taylor was having none of it. Harris denied that anything untoward had occurred and Tattle can state that when we've had Thai massage there's a lot more pain than pleasure. (This is not to say that there are not some Thai women whose hands dance on the small pole, but Thai massage as a specialty frequently uses arms and legs as levers to apply traction - not friction.)\nBy the end of the day, People magazine and others were reporting that the musical couple had not broken up and that Harris was quite upset about the insinuations.\nHarris yesterday tweeted, \"It's not going to be a 'happy ending' for everyone I sue for defamation of character for all these bulls--- stories bye bye.\"\nAnd a Swift source told People that the split rumors were \"absolutely not true.\"\n* Taylor Swift may not be single, but Rihanna reportedly is.\nWant to have a chance, fellas?\nRiRi told the New York Times' T Magazine , \"I'm turned on by guys who are cultured. That'll keep me intrigued. They don't have to have a single degree, but they should speak other languages or know things about other parts of the world or history or certain artists or musicians. I like to be taught. I like to sit on that side of the table.\"\n\"Parlez-vous Francais, Rihanna?\"\n\"Habla Espanol, Rihanna?\"\n\"Shalom, Rihanna?\"\nTATTBITS * TMZ.com reports that \"Celebrity Wife Swap\" has been canceled after four seasons.\nThe amazing thing is that it lasted four seasons.\nBut we guess that puts the kibosh on that very special Hillary Clinton-Melania Trump wife swap.\n* With \"Bridge of Spies\" opening here Friday, Tom Hanks has tied Harrison Ford with four Steven Spielberg films each.\nWhat's Spielberg's plan to deal with that? He told Yahoo Movies, \"Now, I'll probably do an Indy 5 with Harrison, [so] it'll be five for Harrison, four for Tom . . . I've got to make another one with Tom, that'll be five for Tom, five for Harrison. And I think I'm going to leapfrog that way for the rest of my career. With Daniel Day-Lewis in everything else!\"\n* Britney Spears has plunked down $7.4 million for a Los Angeles-area property that has a 13,264-square-foot mansion sitting on nearly 21 acres, reports TMZ.com.\nThe property has 5BRs, 7.5 BTHs, tennis courts, an infinity pool and a 3-hole golf course.\nSheesh, $7.4 million sounds kind of reasonable.\n* According to Variety , Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Davisson have come on board to produce Paramount's movie about the Volkswagen clean-diesel scandal.\nMaking movies is truly exhausting.\n- Daily News wire services\ncontributed to this report.\nEmail: gensleh@phillynews.com\nPhone: 215-854-5678\nOn Twitter: @DNTattle", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:44:49.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
