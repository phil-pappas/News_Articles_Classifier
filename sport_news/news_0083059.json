The meet also gave swimmers opportunities to record new qualifying times for the district championship meet to be held Oct. 29-20 in Moses Lake. Wa-Hi’s 200-meter medley relay team of Paige Gardner, Hannah Gardner, Mackenzie Hale and Hally Ruff started off the meet with a first-place finish at a minute and 59.48 seconds, two seconds faster than their previous season best. This time last season at the state championship meet, would have placed 18th. Paige Gardner also swam personal best times while stroking to first place in the 100 freestyle (56.06) and second place in the 100 backstroke (1:02.34). Both times would have qualified her for consolation finals (top 16) at state last year. Mackenzie Hale also posted a first- and a second-place finish in the 500 free (5:28.00) and the 200 individual medley respectively (2:18.90). Hale’s 200 IM time is her season best and would have qualified her for consolation finals (top 16) at last year’s state meet. Hannah Gardner won the 100 breast stroke (1:16.32) and was fourth in the 50 free with a new district qualifying time (28.32). Hally Ruff had solid performances today in the 50 free (26.26) and the 100 free (58.76), placing second and third respectively. Elena Holtkamp swam district qualifying times in both the 200 free (2:19.47) and the 100 free (1:04.21), finishing third and ninth respectively. Alana Budden dropped almost four seconds to secure a district spot in her third place 100 back (1:15.06) while also dropping time in the 50 free (29.55). Lacey Klem improved on her district qualifying time in the 50 free (28.52) with her fifth place finish. She also swam well in the 100 free (1:02.65) to finish in seventh place. TigerScots bounce back, top Irrigon IRRIGON — Weston-McEwen split a pair of Columbia Basin Conference volleyball matches here Saturday. The TigerScots opened the day with a 25-23, 25-8, 25-17 loss to second-ranked and CBC-leading Culver, but bounced back to topple Irrigon, 25-11, 25-20, 25-11. W-M, now 7-2 in league and 19-8 overall, clinched second place in the league with their Saturday triumph.
