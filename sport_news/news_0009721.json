She says her time studying chimpanzees was the most magic time of her life.\nStudents from around Oregon had a rare opportunity todayâ€”to share their field based research and environmental projects with one of the world's most well-known researchers and activists, Dr. Jane Goodall .\nThe Oregon Youth Summit was held Thursday, October 15 at David Douglas High School in Portland. The event was presented in part by the Diack Ecology Education Program and the Oregon branch of Goodall's Roots & Shoots program.\nDr. Jane Goodall was the keynote speaker at the event, but prior to her presentation, the octogenarian spent two hours reviewing student displays of their field-based research and restoration projects.\nStudents waited by their displays nervously, as Dr .Goodall slowly moved through the crowd, clutching a small stuffed animal. Cell phones were raised high, documenting her every move, and fingers flew as they quickly posted photos to social media.\n\"She's like a rock star,\" one person observed.\nFor Maya Kaup, 20, of Willamette University, to meet Dr. Goodall, even for a few brief minutes, was to spend time with a hero. Kaup aspires to be a field biologist in Costa Rica and says she has admired the work of Dr. Goodall since Kaup was four years old.\nKaup eagerly smiled for a photo alongside Dr. Goodall, and watched as her slight figure moved on to the next display.\n\"I've always wanted to be just like her,\" she said.\n--Kristyna Wentz-Graff\n@kwgphoto", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:37:40.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
