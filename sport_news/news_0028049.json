And yet, Julien cannot be surprised that questions are already being asked.\nEven before the season started, Julien was on the hot seat after the Bruins fired general manager Peter Chiarelli and then significantly changed the roster.

He is not the reason why Tuukka Rask — the bedrock on which the Bruins stand — has allowed 14 goals in three games. And yet, with the team in transition, it is likely going to be Julien who gets blamed for how Boston is playing.\nAnd he is not alone. Though the season is still young, there are plenty of coaches on thin ice. Here are five whose jobs could be in jeopardy:\nTodd Richards, Columbus\nWhat’s that old saying again? Show me a good goaltender and I’ll show you a good head coach. Well, the flipside is also true. Sergei Bobrovsky, who has a 4.66 goals-against average and a .850 save percentage, is a big reason why Columbus is 0-3-0 to start the season. While off-season acquisition Brandon Saad has two goals in three games, the 2013 Vezina Trophy-winning Bobrovsky has allowed 12 goals in that same span. One day after coughing up a third-period lead to the Rangers — he gave up three goals in the final three minutes — Bobrovsky was pulled after allowing four goals on 22 shots.\nMike Johnston, Pittsburgh\nDon’t blame Phil Kessel. The former Leafs sniper has been called a coach killer in the past, but so far he is not to blame. In fact, Kessel has scored the only goal — and only point — in two games for the Penguins, but like his time in Toronto, he is not getting much in the way of help. Pittsburgh headed into Tuesday night’s game against Montreal having been outscored 5-1. Sidney Crosby has no shots in two games. And while it is a terribly small sample size, it may not be long before fingers get pointed at Johnston, especially after the Penguins lost in the first round of last year’s playoffs.\nDarryl Sutter, Los Angeles\nEvery coach has a shelf life. It does not matter how many Stanley Cups they have won or how many years they have spent in a city, everyone from Mike Babcock to Barry Trotz eventually reaches an expiry date. Could that time be coming for two-time Cup winner Darryl Sutter? Again, it’s premature. And yet, after missing the playoffs last year there are indications that the team will not wait around hoping they get hot in the second-half of the season. “You can't have highs and lows in your season if you want to be a playoff team,” Sutter told reporters, following losses to the Sharks and Coyotes to start the season.\nBruce Boudreau, Anaheim\nYou don’t see Carolina’s Bill Peters or Florida’s Gerard Gallant on this list. That is because the coaches that tend to be on the hot seat are in markets where expectations are high. In Boudreau’s case, they are sky-high. The Ducks were just about everyone’s pick to win the Stanley Cup, so starting out 0-1-1 is far from ideal. Like Ken Hitchcock in St. Louis, Boudreau entered this season on somewhat shaky ground because of the team's playoff record. It is not that they did not go deep into the post-season, but rather that they, in the last two years, lost to the team that went on to win the Cup.\nLindy Ruff, Dallas\nDallas entered Tuesday night’s game against Edmonton with a 1-1-0 record to start the season, but keep an eye on Ruff. With so much offensive firepower — Jamie Benn led the league in scoring, Tyler Seguin finished in the top-10 and Patrick Sharp was acquired in the off-season — the Stars are expected to rebound after missing the playoffs last year. Ruff clearly knows this. So when the losses do come, they seem magnified. This explains why Ruff was fuming after a 6-3 loss to Colorado on Saturday, calling the players’ effort, “embarrassing, worse than disappointing.” A few days later, there were reports that he was planning to scratch 2013 first-rounder Valeri Nichushkin from Tuesday night’s lineup.\nNHL\nPlenty of NHL coaches on thin ice in early going\nBy Michael Traikos , Postmedia Network First posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 08:12 PM EDT | Updated: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 08:18 PM EDT\nNext question.\nThat was how head coach Claude Julien responded when he was asked following Monday’s 6-3 loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning if he thinks his job is in jeopardy.
