(AP) - South Carolina removed a Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse grounds weeks after the June massacre of nine worshippers at a historic black church. While the attack prompted debate about the public display of Old South symbols, Mississippi is still flying a state flag with the rebel emblem.\nThis is a Mississippi election year, and the flag is a sticky subject.\nRepublican Gov. Phil Bryant says if the flag design is reconsidered, it should be done by a statewide vote and not by legislators.\nHis Democratic challenger, truck driver Robert Gray, says the Confederate symbol is like a warning label to stay away from the state.\nMississippi voters chose to keep the flag in 2001. But, several cities and counties have stopped flying it since the slayings in Charleston.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
