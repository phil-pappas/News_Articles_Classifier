USA Today Sports 1 day ago by Kevin Allen, USA TODAY Sports © Robert Mayer, USA TODAY Sports Robert Mayer, USA TODAY Sports Every time Jaromir Jagr plays a shift for the Florida Panthers it is as if he is continuing a lecture series on the art of hockey for his young teammates.\nAdChoices ‘I’m definitely taking notes on what he is doing,” Florida center Nick Bjugstad says.\nThanks to the presence of Bjugstad, Aleksander Barkov and Aaron Ekblad, among others, the Panthers are viewed as an up-and-coming team. But it’s older players such as Jagr, 43, captain Willie Mitchell, 38, Brian Campbell and Roberto Luongo, both 36, who have helped the Panthers come of age more quickly.\n“A bigger guy like myself, I watch (Jagr) in the corners,” Bjugstad says. “No one gets the puck from him. He just sticks his butt out and no one can get it. It’s crazy.”\nJagr will likely play on a line with center Barkov, 20, and Jonathan Huberdeau, 22, neither of whom were born when Jagr launched his NHL career in 1990. Jagr was already a four-time 30-goal scorer when Barkov was born in 1995.\n“What Jagr is bringing to the table is incredible, even off ice,” Panthers general manager Dale Tallon says. “His work ethic, approach and attitude are terrific. He has really excited these two young guys.”\nThe Panthers were 12-7-2 after they acquired Jagr from New Jersey last season.\n“I don’t think there is any sign that he is slowing down,” Bjugstad says\nLuongo’s steadiness in net has significantly bolstered the team’s confidence. “He doesn’t talk too much,” Bjugstad says. “He is kind of a silent guy, but when he speaks up, it’s definitely heard throughout the locker room.”\nLuongo’s .921 save percentage last season was critical.\n“Lou doesn’t accept losing and he instilled that in us,” Bjugstad says\nMitchell was named captain last season after coming over from the Los Angeles Kings. “He jumped right in, and guys respected him,” Bjugstad says.\nHalf of the team was at Mitchell’s house for Thanksgiving. The Panthers became very close under Mitchell’s command.\n“I watched him play for the (Minnesota) Wild when I was in the fourth grade,” Bjugstad says, chuckling.\nBjugstad enjoyed telling Mitchell that tale. “I think he loves it because he’s a young soul at heart,” Bjugstad says\nThe Panthers, seven points out of a playoff spot last season, are a trendy pick to make it now. The team simply needs more goals.\n“What do we need, three or four more wins?” Tallon says. “How many goals is that? Score 10 more and give up 10 fewer. It was probably a 20-goal differential.”\nBjugstad, coming off back surgery, posted 24 goals last season, while Barkov had 16 and Huberdeau added 15. Those three players might be able to total 75 goals this season.\n“I give Nick credit, he probably played hurt 20 games when he could barely tie his skates,” Tallon says “He kept playing and kept playing. He is becoming a man. He can really skate and he’s getting stronger and more confident. He and Barkov are going to make us strong up the middle for a long time.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T13:01:25.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
