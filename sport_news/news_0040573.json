The Owls hope to do just that today as they host Point for homecoming. Staff photo by Kathryn Ingall slideshow KENNESAW — As Kennesaw State returns to Fifth Third Bank Stadium for the first time since suffering its first loss, the players are ready to get that lingering memory behind them.After waiting two weeks, the Owls (3-1) will host Point (5-1) today with the idea of celebrating the first football homecoming by getting back into the win column.“We’ve had a lot of firsts,” Kennesaw State coach Brian Bohannon said. “We’ve had our first loss. Now, how do we respond from that? What kind of gains do we make from that? This needs to be the biggest jump we’ve had since we’ve been here.”Bohannon also said there has been no looking ahead to next week’s Big South Conference opener against Gardner-Webb. When asked about how much planning or scouting he and his staff had done to prepare for conference play, Bohannon had a simple one-word answer: “Zero.”“We don’t look ahead to anything,” he said. “We’re nowhere near, nor will we ever be while I’m here, that we look ahead to anything.“It’s human nature when you go out and have a little success early. You get pats on the back, and the next thing you know, it’s, ‘I can’t wait ’til you guys get to conference.’ That’s not the best thing for our football team. It’s one rep at a time, one day at a time. Can we get better?”Point will be the second NAIA team Kennesaw State has faced. The first was Edward Waters, which the Owls beat 58-7 last month. Point, which plays in the same conference as Edward Waters, beat the Tigers 56-14 two weeks ago, and the Skyhawks’ balanced offensive attack could present some problems for the Kennesaw State defense.“They are a ‘spread-them-out’ team on offense,” Kennesaw State coach Brian Bohannon said. “They throw the ball. They are a more controlled passing game, a one-back running game with some zone-read stuff.”Quarterback Charles Fortis is the trigger man for a Point offense that has averaged 438.5 yards and 42.2 points a game. He has thrown for 1,187 yards a 15 touchdowns and eight interceptions.Fortis’ most frequent targets are the 5-foot-7 Brandon Robertson, who has caught 21 passes for 360 yards and three touchdowns, and Charles Duckworth, who is a deep threat with 14 catches for 326 yards and six touchdowns.As a team, Point will run the ball with a committee of backs. The Skyhawks have six different backs who have run more than 100 yards, but none has surpassed 150.As high-scoring as the Skyhawks’ offense may be, they have allowed nearly as many points on defense, though that number is inflated by a 73-21 season-opening loss to Reinhardt.“They are not complicated,” Bohannon said, “but they are getting their kids to play hard. They play an eight-man front against whoever they play.”Point has allowed 33.6 points and 445.2 yards of total offense per game. What may play further into the Owls’ advantage is the Skyhawks’ average of allowing 252 rushing yards. Kennesaw State comes is fourth in the Football Championship Subdivision, averaging 324 rushing yards per game.After saying Kennesaw State’s 31-27 loss at Dayton was the Owls’ worst special teams performance of the season, Bohannon said Point’s punt return and coverage teams could cause problems if the Owls’ previous issues weren’t fixed.“They have returned a punt, or blocked a punt, in every game,” Bohannon said. “If we don’t have them fixed, their return guy (Robertson) will have a field day. He’s the best one we may face all year.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:07:22.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
