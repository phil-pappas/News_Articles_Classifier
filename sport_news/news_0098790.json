This isn't Chip Kelly's offense. T.J. Ward and Ifo Ekpre-Olomu aren't patrolling the UO secondary.\nThis is beginning to look like a long season in Eugene, made more dreary by the Ducks' recent success.\n\"They've had a great thing going for the past however long it's been,\" WSU linebacker Jeremiah Allison said. \"They've been one of the best teams in the country.\"\nNo more. The Ducks (3-3) are .500 at the regular season's halfway point, and the easy part of the schedule is in the rearview mirror.\nWashington, fresh from a Thursday upset of USC, waits next week in Seattle. Then comes an Arizona State, Cal, Stanford and USC minefield.\nThe scoreboard showed WSU won in double-overtime, but the statistical story is damning.\nThe Cougars finished with 31 first downs to Oregon's 18, had 505 yards passing to Oregon's 123 and rolled up 641 yards total offense.\nThe Ducks had a 10-point lead with 8:20 play and couldn't hold it.\nAsked how he felt at the 8:20 mark, WSU coach Mike Leach said: \"I was kind of concerned. I figured we ought to be 10 up. ...\n\"We moved the ball pretty much the whole game. All of a sudden there would be mishap.\"\nUntil the game was on the line. Then the Cougars finished like Muhammad Ali.\n\"We outpunched them at the end,\" Leach said.\nIt happened at Autzen, in front of 57,775 fans imploring the Ducks to land the last blow.\nTwo weeks ago, the Ducks lost to Utah, which might be the best team in the conference. This time they lost to the team picked to finish fifth in the Pac-12 North.\nRemember, Washington State (3-2) began the season by face-planting at home against Portland State.\nNo knock on PSU, which is 4-1 and blew out North Texas on Saturday. The Vikings look like they might be in the top echelon of the Big Sky Conference.\nBut when a Pac-12 team loses at home to an FCS school, it's a sure sign of trouble.\nMark Helfrich press conference after 45-38 OT loss to WSU Helfrich talked about missing chances to finish the game in regulation and about the quarterback rotation.\nSpeaking of trouble, who could have anticipated the way the bottom has dropped out at Oregon?\nAt the moment, Oregon's offense is all about top-shelf running backs Royce Freeman and Taj Griffin. They combined for 345 yards rushing, well over half of the UO offense.\nThe Ducks don't throw it well enough to force a good defense to play them honestly.\nThat problem could ease when – or, if – quarterback Vernon Adams recovers from a fractured index finger on his passing hand.\nBut it's hard to understand how this program doesn't have another guy on the depth chart who can execute the offense.\nOf course, Adams was a one-season bandage from the start.\nAnd Adams doesn't play defense. The theory that Oregon's young secondary would improve with experience now looks fatally flawed.\nIf Oregon's defensive backs are getting better, it's not happening fast enough. Not with what is waiting in the second half of the season.\n\"There is nobody on that team over there that 15 teams weren't recruiting,\" Leach said. \"They all had 15 offers or better. They're good players.\"\nScott Frost talks about QB rotation after loss to WSU Frost also talked about one particular play and about play calling, especially near the end of regulation.\nIf true, Oregon has too many players who were massively overrated. Or the good players they have aren't performing to their ability level.\nFreeman and Griffin could suit up for anyone. The Ducks have proven receivers, if they had a quarterback who could execute the passing game.\nCharles Nelson was all over the field on both sides of the ball.\nBut after that, on this night, Washington State looked better.\nWhich is why the Cougars could celebrate, and why Oregon's fans could be in for a very depressing second half of the season.\n-- Ken Goe\nkgoe@oregonian.com\n503-221-8040 | @KenGoe", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KenGoe"], "published": "2015-10-11T05:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:19:01.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
