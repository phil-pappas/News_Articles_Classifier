His precise ball to Valencia gave the Ecuador international room to cross for Martial, whose excellent glancing header went in off the far post beyond the dive of Akinfeev.\nUnited pushed forward for a winner and Akinfeev reacted well to parry the ball away from substitute Marouane Fellaini after Depay's cross, but CSKA held out for a draw, keeping it level with Van Gaal's side on four points from three games in Group B.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:25:53.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
