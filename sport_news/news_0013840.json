Defensive end Olivier Vernon seems very likely to find his paycheck docked by the NFL this week after he went late and low into the left knee of Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota, who remained in the game but limped through the remainder of it following Vernon’s second-quarter shot, which drew a roughing-the-passer penalty.\n\"I think it was done with the idea of trying to hurt our QB and that's (expletive) football,” Titans coach Ken Whisenhunt said after watching his prized rookie jeopardized.\nMariota was sacked six times and hit seven times in total. He said afterward, “I’m all right.”\nMariota admitted he hadn’t seen a replay of the hit following the loss and thus had no opinion on it but did say Vernon apologized to him after the game.\nFollow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis .\nBest of NFL Week 6 Go to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyxle.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Peyton", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfyZGh.img&quot;}}", "http://www.twitter.com/ByNateDavis", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfBvAH.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB5Xmi3&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Pitt", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfBD9z.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BBkkQsl&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;This", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyxle.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;49ers", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfBkJT.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB5XEUw.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Pitt", "http://feed.theplatform.com/f/BKQ29B/MSN-Prime&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;football_nfl&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:55:50.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
