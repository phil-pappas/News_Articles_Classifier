TMHS and Juneau-Douglas compete at Wrangell this weekend. By Klas Stolpe JUNEAU EMPIRE \nOne season removed from their Alaska School Activities Association waiver to wrestle among Alaska’s smaller programs, Juneau-Douglas and Thunder Mountain high schools will again compete with larger 4A schools this season. \nJuneau-Douglas, Thunder Mountain and Ketchikan begin the high school season at Wrangell this weekend, among a wealth of their small school neighbors. \n“This will be a lot better for training,” JDHS senior Cody Weldon said. “Especially when you get to see a variety of techniques. You are not just wrestling the same guy every time and then you go up north and everyone is different. It is good to get a lot of different experience against different people.” \nAdded TMHS senior Hunter Boyer: “It is important because the more you wrestle the better you will get, even if you win or lose, it is just about being able to go out there.” \nTHE CRIMSON \nBEARS DEN \nThe Crimson Bears return three state qualifiers. \nJunior captain’s Ethan Goebel and Taylor Sutak placed second, 160-pounds and 220-pounds, respectively, in the combined Region V tournament. Neither placed at state. \n“I just feel like I am more in shape this season,” Sutak said. “Hopefully I will be more aggressive and wrestle better. We have a big group of guys, a lot of new people, so it will be interesting.” \nSenior captain Cody Weldon finished third at 182-pounds at regionals and fourth at state. He moves up to the 195-pound weight class this season. \n“I am heavier than last year,” Weldon said. “I hope I trained hard enough to do better this year. I am faster than a lot of guys at 195, and I don’t think strength will be an issue. I still need to work on my technique a bit, but who doesn’t?” \nWeldon also has a Judo background, which he said “definitely helps with my sense of balance. A lot of the guys will find it is hard to take me down.” \nJDHS first-year head coach John Joeright said he is “ecstatic” about this year’s group of wrestlers. \n“We have a hard working, dedicated and highly motivated squad. Cody works hard and has been an exceptional leader on this team,” Joeright said. “(Cody), Ethan and Taylor have real good chances to repeat and place at state in December. Tucker Joeright (his son, a sophomore) has cut down to 138 and I’m hopeful that he will do well there and senior Adam Murphy shows real promise at 113 (pounds). \n“I think all of these wrestlers have the potential and determination to send a few more to Anchorage this season,” he continued. “If nothing else, their experiences and efforts will inspire future rosters and continue to regrow this program.” \nThe JDHS program has seen a decline over the past 12 years. Joeright said that is changing and the roster of 16 is a step in the right direction. \n“This year we have had a real spike in interest,” Joeright said. “It takes real courage from deep within to endure truly grueling practices, manage one’s weight down to the ounce and then go out after all those hours of suffering and do battle, one-on-one, in front of a lot of people.” \nTHE FALCONS NEST \nThe top returner for the Falcons is Hunter Boyer, a 145-pound regional champion who finished third at state. \n“I am feeling pretty confidant,” Boyer said. “We have been training pretty hard over the summer. Overall it is a good feeling. I think our team will do well this year. With the number of guys we have we can switch it up a bit more in the practice room.” \nBoyer attended some top camps this summer and has set his sights on the state tournament. \n“It was a serious commitment,” Boyer said. “It was really hot too. You have to train to get better each year. If you don’t do anything you can’t really expect much out of yourself. I love the competition in wrestling. It is you out there. It is solely what you put in is what you are going to get out. Fans should be excited this year.” \nAccording to first year head coach Jason Boyer, Hunter’s father, the Falcons are talented. \n“Our guys to watch this year are Hunter, Deven Mason, Tyler Cole, Sam Nolan and Carl Tupou,” Boyer said. “Alex Ocana transferred up from Oregon and he will push Hunter. Carl Tupou transferred to Thunder Mountain from Haines and is looking very tough in practice; expecting great things from him this season. We have several freshman in the program. These guys will hopefully build this program over the next four years.” \nBoth schools will wrestle the small school schedule in Southeast but will also compete in a few large school tournaments. The Falcons have trips planned to travel north for the Colony Tournament and the Lancer Smith. The Crimson Bears hope to include the Anchorage Christian Invitational. \n“These are the two most important tournaments for us so those kids that make it to state see who they must prepare for,” Boyer said. “After looking at the rosters for other (Southeast) schools, it seems that the numbers are a little better than last year.” \nThe Falcons boast 23 kids on the mat. \n“That is a great turnout and I am hoping to continue building on that number to help our sport grow in Southeast,” Boyer said. “The kids I have this year are very motivated. I look forward to getting to practice each day to teach them something new and push them to see what they can accomplish.” \nCole, a 170-pound senior, is another TMHS captain and attended the same off-season training camps as Boyer, including a 12-day intensive camp in California. \n“It was up in the mountains,” Cole said. “It wasn’t fun. I enjoyed the experience but it was hard work. I have been training really hard. Hopefully Hunter and I will win state. If I don’t I can’t get mad at it. Just have to learn from my mistakes and move on. What I love about this sport is the intensity and the drive. I tell our freshmen not to get mad over a loss, but to learn from it and fix the mistakes you made.” \nThe 2015 state tournaments will be held in Anchorage Dec. 18-19, with the 1A/2A/3A tourney at Chugiak and the 4A tournament at Bartlett. \nTHE ROSTERS \nCrimson Bears: 113 lbs - Adam Murphy (senior); 120 lbs - Daniel Peters (freshman); 132 lbs - Festus LaChester (Freshman); 138 lbs - Tucker Joeright - (sophomore); 145 lbs - Steven Ireland Haight (freshman); 152 lbs - Reilly Sutak (freshman); 160 lbs - Ethan Goebel (junior, captain); 160 lbs - John Williams (junior); 160 lbs - John Schmitz (junior); 160 lbs - Royce Whitehead (sophomore); 170 lbs - Jayden Kohler (sophomore); 170 lbs - Seth Machakas (sophomore); 170 lbs - Lance Fenumai (sophomore); 182 lbs - Taylor Sutak (senior, captain); 195 lbs - Cody Weldon (junior, Capt.); Heavy Weight - Chris Coulson (junior). \nFalcons: 98 lbs - Connor Norman (freshman); 113 lbs - Juan Fisher (junior); 120 lbs - Jacob Tapia (sophomore); 120 lbs - Caleb Deer (freshman); 120 lbs - Austin Jackson (freshman); 120 lbs - M.

Larger schools were classified as AA and smaller schools A. The first Alaska State High School Wrestling Tournament was held in 1972 at Service.
