The incident took place just a few minutes after Sefolosha and Antic’s fellow NBA player Chris Copeland was stabbed outside of the club—and it resulted in Sefolosha suffering a broken leg . Sefolosha denied any wrongdoing and claimed that aggressive police work was to blame for the injury he suffered, but police eventually charged him with obstructing government administration , disorderly conduct , and resisting arrest and, after turning down a plea deal, he was ordered to stand trial.\nEarlier today, Sefolosha's trial ended with him being found not guilty on all three charges and cleared of any wrongdoing. He just released a statement explaining how happy he is about the verdict. But in his statement, he alludes to the fact that he’s not sure why he was forced to stand trial given all of the evidence that was on his side. Here’s his statement:\nStatement from Hawks guard Thabo Sefolosha on court decision in NYC that has \"my name cleared of any wrongdoing.\" pic.twitter.com/jNtgVevxFQ\n— Marc J.
