(AP) - New Hampshire's Republican Party chairwoman is calling Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Colin Van Ostern a \"career politician with few real life accomplishments.\"\nVan Ostern, who on Thursday became the first Democrat to announce a run, has been on the governor's Executive Council since 2012. A 36-year-old who lives in Concord, he has not held any other elected position, though he has worked for numerous political campaigns.\nResponding to his announcement, GOP chairwoman Jennifer Horn says Van Ostern's commitment to party politics runs deeper than his commitment to the state's best interests.\nFellow Executive Councilor Chris Sununu, who is seeking the Republican nomination for governor, said earlier this week the race is about a new direction for the state, not which opponent he'll face.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
