It's a feat hard to ignore. \"It's a good record,\" Hartem senior right-side hitter Lexi Strange said. \"I'm real proud of my team.\" Yet again, it's only a record, said Hartem coach Jennifer Hayes. \"I could be 0-30 going into regionals as long as we played well down the stretch,\" Hayes said. \"But I'll take the wins over the losses. The losses we've had, we've learned from. That's what we have to do going in.\" The Lady Stags trampled Illini Bluffs 2-0 Tuesday night in their home finale: 25-10 and 25-8. They will finish the regular season in the Quincy Notre Dame Tournament Friday and Saturday and start the IHSA Class 1A Roanoke-Benson Regional against either Delavan or Peoria Heights on Tuesday. Hartem, which eyes a return to the state finals, will most likely advance to the regional championship game against host Roanoke-Benson, a potentially serious threat to its postseason aspirations. \"Tonight we came out a little upset because it was Senior Night, but we played a good game,\" Strange said. \"We're ready to look forward to the postseason.\" Hartem's seniors have played together for years. It showed on Tuesday. \"I've known they're a special group since they were really little,\" Hayes said. \"They just have really good chemistry. They play well together and they have intensity and fire. I know coming through the ranks and the state titles they hold (in junior high) and what they brought into the high school as freshmen, you knew it was going to be something special.\" They carried the high school program to state runner-up last year. \"We've played together forever it seems like,\" senior setter Adre Vetter said. \"I'm definitely going to miss it.\" The Lady Stags jumped to big leads at the start of both sets. They led 8-1 in the first set after a Strange ace and Vetter kill. Strange had three aces and four kills in the game--and delivered big pops. \"I'd say it's gotten better since the beginning of the season,\" Strange said. \"Having that bond with Adre really pulls us together and knowing her sets will be there is what lets me do my thing.\" Hartem cruised to a 23-9 advantage after Vetter assisted to sophomore outside hitter Tearaney Eads and won 25-10 after Vetter's second and last kill of the match. Vetter contributed 20 assists, three blocks and two kills. \"I thought we all did really well,\" Vetter said. \"We came in as a team and just played our game.\" Hartem finished the Dakota Tournament 5-0 on Saturday. It took a toll on Vetter, but it didn't affect her on Tuesday. Page 2 of 2 - \"I was getting really tired,\" Vetter said of Saturday. \"I was ready to go home and go to bed. I was so proud of us. We did really well.\" The Lady Stags pounced again early in the second set, leading 8-0 after a pair of Vetter blocks. Strange's final kill of the match made it 21-7. Eads clinched the second game 25-8 with a kill on the right side. She led the offense with seven kills, while senior outside hitter Kaylee Beekman had six kills. Beekman and sophomore libero Emme Olson each had two digs. \"My seniors are just a class act,\" Hayes said. \"All of my underclassmen are doing their job, and they've done a nice job of going smoothly and playing as a team. The seniors take care of it like they should.\" By Bill Welt", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:07:34.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
