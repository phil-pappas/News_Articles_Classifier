Farrell, who took a medical leave of absence of Aug. 14, completed his final round of chemotherapy treatments last week. And although he will undergo additional scans in about three weeks, doctors have said it may take 3-6 months before he feels 100 percent. \nLovullo, meanwhile, figured to be a hot managerial prospect after guiding the Red Sox to a 28-19 mark entering today's series finale here against the Indians. With the potential for some teams to fire their manager as soon as tomorrow (interim manager Pat Murphy might be on the chopping block in San Diego, while Matt WIlliams is likely to be axed in Washington), it seemed likely the Sox would be asked to grant permission for Lovullo to interview for jobs. \nSo, while Dombrowski was ready to commit to Farrell as the manager for next season, he also wanted to keep Lovullo around. The solution: Sign Lovullo to a two-year contract extension, one that will pay him in the \"upper echelon\" of bench coaches, according to Dombrowski, and ask him to guarantee he wouldn't pursue managerial openings this winter. \nDombrowski made that offer to Lovullo during the Red Sox' final homestand. And after a few days of deliberation, Lovullo agreed to the contract last week while the Red Sox were in New York. \n\"The commitment’s made to John, he’ll be our manager for 2016, he should be fine,\" Dombrowski said. \"But I also want to make sure, how do we protect ourselves in case -- and again, I’m not sure it’s going to be six months; I hope it’s three months, and if it’s three months, the time frame works out well -- but what happens if it’s six months? We’re already into the start of next season. You’re also in a position where you start talking about spring training, preparation for spring training. It's a great time of year but it also can be a grueling time of year, and I don’t want that extra stress on him to feel that I’ve got to be ready, I’ve got to be ready. Trying to come up with what ideally would be a fallback plan if he just wasn’t quite up to par.\" \nLovullo has interviewed for several managerial positions over the past few years, including last winter with the Twins and Rangers. By virtue of the way the Red Sox have played over the past seven weeks, his stock has never been higher. Thus, the decision to forsake a potential managerial job wasn't easy. \n\"It just felt right to be here, it just felt right to stay here, it just felt right to see this through,\" Lovullo said. \"I have a love for the organization, I have a love for John, I have a love for the players. If something were to happen, my time is coming if it's meant to be. It just felt like this was the right thing to do to stay here to see it through.\" \nIn addition, the Red Sox announced the major-league coaching staff will remain nearly intact, with the exception of first-base coach Arnie Beyeler . The Red Sox charged Beyeler with overseeing Hanley Ramirez' failed transition to left field. Dombrowski said that didn't have anything to do with his departure, which was prompted by the fact that the Sox wanted to make at least one change to the coaching staff. Moreover, Beyeler said he wasn't told Ramirez' situation was a reason for his termination. \nChili Davis (hitting coach), Carl Willis (pitching coach) and Brian Butterfield (third-base/infield coach) will return, while Dana LeVangie will reprise his role as bullpen coach after serving as interim bench coach. Bob Kipper , who had been serving as bullpen coach, will return to his pitching coach duties at Triple-A Pawtucket. \nFinally, strength and conditioning coach Pat Sandora won't return next season, the Sox announced. \nTwitter: @ScottLauber", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T22:53:00.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
