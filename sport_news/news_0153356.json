The last meeting of the Appointments Committee of Cabinet for instance helped increase the long list of officers holding temporary charge. As it was unable to announce incumbents to five senior posts, the Small Industries Secretary will also function as the Secretary for Steel, the Secretary of the Inter State Secretariat will look after the Department of North East Affairs as well, the chief grievances officer in the Cabinet Secretary will be the Chairman of the National Authority for Chemical Weapons as well as Secretary (Security). The malaise has now hit the army which usually announces the replacements four weeks in advance. There is something seriously amiss if the posts remain vacant though the government had informally sounded out some of the nominees in advance. The most crucial headless post is that of Director General of Military Operations who now has the added responsibility of keeping in touch with his Pakistani counterpart to maintain tranquility on the line of control. The others are Military Secretary, responsible for all promotions in the army, the chief of Rashtriya Rifles which spearheads the army's counter-insurgency operations in J & K and top posts in the Defence Intelligence Agency, Mechanised Forces and Military Engineering Services. The former Army Chief and current Minister of State V K Singh's running commentary on the suitability of officers to various posts hasn't helped matters. Clearly he hasnâ€™t forgotten the bruises suffered in the controversy over his date of birth. This is a busy time for Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar as he tries to operationalise the one rank, one pension (OROP) award, reorient the Defence Research Development Organisation and ensure controversy-free purchase of new equipment. Mr. Parrikar cannot afford the derailment of the army promotion system especially in the top ranks. He could also seek a gag order on Gen. Singh who seems to be taking advantage of his position as Minister to publicly doubt the abilities of serving army officers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:15:26.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
