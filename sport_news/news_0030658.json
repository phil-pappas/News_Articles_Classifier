He knocked in a loose puck in front of the net after Tomas Hertl's shot and Patrick Marleau's follow bounced off Lack's pads. \nWard scored again seven minutes later, beating Lack to the top left shelf in a 1-on-1 encounter. \nFaulk scored on a power play, just the Hurricanes' third of the season, matching the Sharks. A series of crisp passes, the last by Nathan Gerbe, gave Faulk a good look. \nPavelski took advantage of an errant shot by Marc-Edouard Vlasic that bounced off the glass and back in front of the net to poke it through an opening. \nWingels was able to tip in a rebound to end Lack's night. \nNash, who missed the last five games, scored with an assist from Noah Hanifan. \nWard completed the hat trick in the final minute with an empty-net goal. \nNOTES: Ward's first goal gave him 100 for his career. ...
