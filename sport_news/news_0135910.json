Stanford (4-1, 3-0) has already lost starter Harrison Phillips for the year and has used a makeshift line for stretches of the past three games.

(Jim Gensheimer/Bay Area News Group) ( Jim Gensheimer ) \nMeanwhile, Hogan still hasn't recovered from the sprained left ankle suffered in the third quarter at USC. Then again, it hasn't affected his play: In the two games since the injury, he has a 78.7 completion percentage. \n\"I've teased him that we should have kicked him in the ankle early last year,'' Shaw said. \"(But) he's been that way before the ankle. He has calm about him. All the ankle has done is slowed him down a little as a runner. But as far as pocket mechanics, he's been outstanding.\" \nRedshirt freshman Keller Chryst replaced Hogan in the late stages of the blowout victory over Arizona, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's the No. 2 quarterback, ahead of sophomore Ryan Burns. \n\"It's fluid,'' Shaw said. \nChryst is ahead of Burns -- and every other offensive player â€” in one category: Pancake blocks. \nHe flattened Arizona cornerback Cam Denson on Christian McCaffrey's 25-yard run in the second quarter. \n\"We all thought that was the funniest thing ever, slash, felt really bad for that guy,'' Stanford linebacker Blake Martinez said, \"because he should never play football.'' \nChryst weighs 233 pounds. Denson is all of 168. \nTurnovers remain a source of concern for Shaw -- not the frequency of giveaways, but the paucity of takeaways. \nStanford has committed four turnovers in five games (tied for 16th nationally), but it has forced only three (120th). \n\"Sometimes, it's the way the ball bounces, but we're going to keep working on it,'' Shaw said. \"We need turnover plays. Those things have eluded us -- the things you need to have to take pressure off the offense for driving 60, 70, 80 yards at a time.\" \nOutside linebacker Kevin Anderson (undisclosed) is not expected to play next week.
