The directions by the Division Bench comprising Justice Satish Kumar Mittal and Justice Hari Pal Verma, came on a suo motu or “court-on-its-own motion” case against Haryana, Punjab and the Union Territory of Chandigarh. “As far as Haryana is concerned, we direct the state government to take further steps under the Mental Health Act, 1987, in order to provide facilities to the mentally retarded/ill persons as per the directions given in the order dated January 15 of this court,” the Bench asserted. Taking up the matter again, the Bench also asked Haryana, Punjab and the Union Territory of Chandigarh to specify whether separate wards or blocks have been assigned in jails to convicts and other prisoners suffering from mental disability or disorder. The Bench added: “If there is no such arrangement, we direct them to explore the possibilities to have such arrangement and inform the court by the next date of hearing”. The proceedings were initiated on a reference received from the Supreme Court. Registering the matter as “court-on-its-own motion” case, the High Court had also directed the member-secretaries of the legal services authorities of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh to furnish reports submitted by them to the apex court”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:05:03.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
