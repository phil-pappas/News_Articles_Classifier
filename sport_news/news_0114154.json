That’s why at Rutgers, the top-ranked Buckeyes had Joel Hale and Michael Hill not only willing to step in next to defensive tackle Adolphus Washington but proven.\n>> Got a question about Ohio State football? Ask the experts!\n“When you can play guys during the course of the season, they’ve been in the game, they’ve been in moments,” Johnson said heading into the game. “Now their play participation goes up. They go up from 15-20 up to 40 plays (with Schutt missing). That’s the only difference — can they play 40 plays? That’s what we have to manage as we go through the game.”\nIt has been the same at defensive end, where All-American Joey Bosa and Tyquan Lewis have been spelled at times by Sam Hubbard and Jalyn Holmes.\n“I think we’re fresher,” Johnson said. “The Indiana game is the only game (so far) where we didn’t play a lot of guys, just because of the way the game was going. But I think if we can take 20, 25 plays off those guys’ shoulders, I think it’s going to help us play faster down the road.”\nIt also has allowed the Buckeyes to employ a “rush men” approach on probable passing downs, with Bosa, Lewis and Hubbard joining former defensive end Washington in a gang approach to getting to the quarterback.\nIt paid big dividends the week before when the Buckeyes sacked Penn State quarterback Christian Hackenberg five times. The Buckeyes went into Saturday night’s game tied for fifth in the nation in sacks with an average of 3.43 per game.\n“Getting our best pass rushers out there, it’s just fun to fly after the quarterback and pretty much all four of us getting there at the same time,” Bosa said heading into the game, where the intent was to do the same to Rutgers quarterback Chris Laviano.\nBut it was at defensive tackle on regular downs where Johnson intended to take advantage of the developed depth. The demands on Hale, Hill, Donovan Munger and perhaps freshman Robert Landers, who was moved into the ready line in the week before, are straightforward, Johnson said.\n>> Click for details on how to win tickets and trips to OSU games from Dispatch Reader Rewards\n“You’ve got to be physical at the point of attack,” he said. “You’ve got to be able to handle double-team blocks; not necessarily be a great pass rusher right now, because we can play a guy first and second down right now and rotate on third down and get a great pass rusher on the field. You’ve got to be able to play the run and hold the point of attack.”\ntmay@dispatch.com\n@TIM_MAYsports", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/buckeyextra"], "published": "2015-10-25T06:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:16:59.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
