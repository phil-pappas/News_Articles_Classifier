The language should be re-established in Sanskrit schools, Sanskrit universities and Sanskrit departments, she said.\nIrani called on the Sanskrit scholars and students enrolled in Sanskrit institutes to think beyond teaching and explore career opportunities in other sectors as well. The minister also appealed to the Sanskrit scholars to engage and develop literature that reflects today's society.\nMore and more research should be conducted in the discipline so that it benefits the common man and is useful for the future of the country, she said.\nLaying stress on greater promotion of Sanskrit, the HRD Minister said if Sanskrit has to become a popular language there is a need to develop standard Sanskrit, otherwise it will remain only a language of a few scholars.\nObserving that the standard of Sanskrit teaching should also be improved, she said it should be taken to non-Sanskrit area of studies and standard of textbooks should be enhanced. Noting that BR Ambedkar had desired to make Sanskrit the national language, Irani said though the proposal did not go through in the Constituent Assembly, it was accepted in the Chapter 4 of the Constitution that for the usage of Hindi as the national language, the vocabulary should be drawn mainly from Sanskrit.\nShe also laid stress on using the Internet to spread Sanskrit to every village and the furthest corners of the country. \"Being the language of Yoga, Ayurveda and Vedanta, Sanskrit now spans across the world. Sanskrit belongs to all. This is a language that unites the country,\" she said.\nAlso Read: Sanskrit is the most useful language for science, technology, claims Rajnath Singh\nFor Sanskrit Diwas, DD News launches Facebook, Twitter accounts in Sanskrit", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T17:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:20:35.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
