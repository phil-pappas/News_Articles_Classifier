Rich Schultz, Getty Images Fullscreen 1. Ohio State (8-0, 4-0) – The Buckeyes finally turned to J.T. Barrett (16) as their starting quarterback and he responded by producing five touchdowns in the blowout victory over Rutgers. There’s no quarterback controversy now as OSU is hitting its stride under the sophomore. Last week: 1.  Rich Schultz, Getty Images Fullscreen 2. Michigan State (8-0, 4-0) – Connor Cook (18) was outstanding once against as the Spartans scored 24 unanswered points to run away from Indiana. Cook has thrown for more than 300 yards in three straight games as the Spartans get a much-needed week off. Last week: 2.  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen 3. Iowa (7-0, 3-0) – It was a week off for the Hawkeyes as they came off a blowout win over Northwestern and look to wrap up the West. There will be tests along the way, including a trip to Nebraska to close the season. Last week: 3.  Matt Marton, Associated Press Fullscreen 4. Wisconsin (6-2, 3-1) – There has been little flashy about the Badgers’ season, and the victory over Illinois was according to script. The injuries continue to pile up for Wisconsin, but it remains alive in the West with just four games to play. Last week: 4.  Mark Hoffman, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Fullscreen 5. Michigan (5-2, 2-1) – The Wolverines had the week off after the devastating loss to Michigan State. They’ll get a chance to show they haven’t caved by heading to Minnesota with an outside shot in the East as the game with Ohio State looms at the end of the season. Last week: 5.  John T. Greilick, Detroit News Fullscreen 6. Northwestern (6-2, 2-2) – It was a huge bounceback week for the Wildcats after getting outscored 78-10 the previous two weeks. They are bowl-eligible after two straight 5-7 seasons, but much more is possible with plenty of winnable games down the stretch. Last week: 10.  Eric Francis, Getty Images Fullscreen 7. Penn State (6-2, 3-1) – The Nittany Lions are bowl-eligible and still have an outside shot in the East after Christian Hackenberg (14) threw for 315 yards and three touchdowns in the win over Maryland. It all comes down to the last two weeks, however, with matchups against Michigan and Michigan State. Last week: 6.  Jamie Sabau, Getty Images Fullscreen 8. Nebraska (3-5, 1-3) – It’s hard to look at the Cornhuskers and think they’re a bad team when you consider they’ve lost all five games by a total of 13 points. But the fact remains that first-year coach Mike Riley (pictured\" hasn’t been able to get his team to finish. Last week: 7.  Nati Harnik, Associated Press Fullscreen 9. Illinois (4-3, 1-2) – The Fighting Illini have now lost two straight after their big win at Nebraska. They couldn’t take advantage of a depleted Wisconsin team, and getting to six wins and a bowl berth are no sure thing with plenty of tough matchups in the final five games. Last week: 8.  Bradley Leeb, Associated Press Fullscreen 10. Minnesota (4-3, 1-2) – It was a much-needed week off for the Gophers, who had lost two of three. They’re likely out of the West Division race, but they have a huge opportunity with Michigan visiting next week, followed by games at Ohio State and Iowa. Last week: 11.  Ann Heisenfelt, Associated Press Fullscreen 11. Indiana (4-4, 0-4) – The Hoosiers have been pesky in some of their biggest games this season, hanging close with both Ohio State and Michigan State. But they have suffered four straight losses and getting two more wins to reach a bowl game will be a tall task. Last week: 12.  Robin Buckson, Detroit News Fullscreen 12. Maryland (2-5, 0-3) – The Terrapins were game in interim coach Mike Locksley’s debut, but they couldn’t contain Penn State’s Christian Hackenberg. The Terps played with far more energy and will be tough to beat as they must win four of their last five to reach a bowl game. Last week: 13.  Karl Merton Ferron, Baltimore Sun Fullscreen 13. Rutgers (3-4, 1-3) – The Scarlet Knights were the unfortunate team to suffer the wrath of Ohio State finally deciding to start J.T. Barrett at quarterback. They offered little resistance and the loss means they must win three of their final five to reach a bowl game, and the schedule is no picnic. Last week: 9.  Rich Schultz, Getty Images Fullscreen 14. Purdue (1-6, 0-3) – The good news this week for the Boilermakers is that they did not lose, which is easy when you don’t play. Trying to avoid a winless Big Ten season is about all that’s left in West Lafayette, something that appears more unlikely as each week passes. Last week: 14.

(Photo: Nati Harnik, Associated Press) \nFor Northwestern, the 2015 season was starting to look a lot like 2013.\nIt was two years ago the Wildcats opened the season with four straight wins and shot up to No. 16 in the country, prepared to host No. 4 Ohio State in one of the biggest games ever played in Evanston.\nThat game went down to the wire with Ohio State holding on for a 40-30 victory. It appeared Northwestern, however, was still on the verge of a big season.\nInstead, the Wildcats lost their next six games and didn’t even reach a bowl.\nNow fast-forward to this season. Northwestern won its first five games, including a season-opening upset of Stanford. It headed into its contest with No. 18 Michigan primed to take over the Big Ten West and establish itself as a player on the national scene.\nBut the opening kick was returned for a touchdown by Michigan and the Wolverines never looked back, sending the Wildcats into a two-week tailspin that looked eerily similar to the one suffered two seasons ago.\nNorthwestern was outscored 78-10 in losses to Michigan and Iowa, and it appeared things were going off the rails. Until Saturday when Northwestern headed to Nebraska, a team that has suffered its share of heartbreak this season.\nRedshirt freshman quarterback Clayton Thorson ran for a career-high 126 yards and threw for another 177, including a 37-yard touchdown pass to Dan Vitale in the fourth quarter that, combined with Jack Mitchell’s third field goal, gave the Wildcats a 30-28 victory at Nebraska.\n“It’s tough being shut out and then losing by 30. It weighs on you,” Thorson said. “We came together on Monday morning and said we’re not letting this happen, we’re not letting down.”\nIt took some big plays early, including a 72-yard interception return for a touchdown by Nick VanHoose. But by the second half, the Wildcats offense was rolling under Thorson.\n“We stuck together and found a way to make some plays in the first half and make it a game,” Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald said.\nNow, Northwestern is bowl eligible after two straight 5-7 seasons.\n“A big team win, a huge team win to get us over the hump and to get to six and get into the postseason,” Fitzgerald said. “But we just talked about it in the locker room. Six is not the destination. We didn’t talk about it in camp — ‘Let’s get to six wins.’ ”\nAfter a bye next week, Northwestern closes with four games that are all winnable, meaning a double-digit win season is still out there.\nIt’s not something many would have expected before the season, and certainly not after the previous two weeks. But here the Wildcats are, maybe not still alive in the West, but primed to remind everyone they’re not going anywhere.\n“It’s really exciting to be bowl eligible,” VanHoose said. “There are a lot of guys in the locker room, me and a couple seniors were talking and we have never experienced going to a bowl game. So it is great to hit that mark. But six is not what we want, obviously we want more than that.”\nNebraska’s near misses \nAs impressive as Northwestern’s victory was, the script is starting to get a little tiresome for Nebraska.\nThe Cornhuskers have lost on a Hail Mary to BYU, they lost in overtime on the road to Miami, gave up the winning score in the final minute to lose to Illinois by one point and fell to Wisconsin on a last-second field goal. Throw in the two-point loss at home to Northwestern and Nebraska has lost five games by a total of 13 points.\n“We’ve got to make sure we keep grinding,” quarterback Tommy Armstrong Jr. said. “We can either give up or we can keep riding this season out and keep working together.”\nAt 3-5 overall, Nebraska must win three of its final four games just to reach a bowl game. That will be no simple task.\nThe Huskers travel to Purdue next week before hosting Michigan State, playing at Rutgers and closing the season on the road against Iowa.\nBut first-year coach Mike Riley intends to keep plugging away.\n“Well, I told them we’re going to coach football and practice football on Monday, and we’re going to continue to work to get better,” Riley said. “Everybody that wants to do that will be there. I think that this group will be.”\nBuckeye switch \nAfter No. 1 Ohio State toyed with Rutgers on Saturday night, there is only one question for coach Urban Meyer . Why the heck did he wait so long to start J.T. Barrett at quarterback?\nIt’s hard to argue with results considering the Buckeyes are unbeaten, but the offense just seemed to be a little off with Cardale Jones starting.\nBarrett was getting small doses of work along the way, but it took until the eighth game for him to take over full-time. I’d say it was the right move.\nThe sophomore threw for three touchdowns and ran for a couple more as he was 14-for-18 for 223 yards passing while he carried the ball 13 times for 101 yards.\n“I think he’s full swing now,” Meyer said.\nNo kidding.\n“He is the prototype dual-threat quarterback, and he puts a tremendous amount of stress on your defense whenever he has the football,” Rutgers coach Kyle Flood said. “He can run it like a running back, and he throws it very well as a quarterback.”\nThat’s a scary thought for the rest of college football – Ohio State was already good. Now the Buckeyes might just be unbeatable.\nmcharboneau@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/mattcharboneau", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T19:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:58:29.155+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
