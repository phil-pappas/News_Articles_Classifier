The new field is very similar to the old field, by the same company, but has a new “Cool Play” feature, which will keep the field cooler for the players, along a slightly different appearance. \nThe new field appears brighter, especially the two end zones, which are a more vivid red with white block lettering of “Utes” on the north end and “Utah” on the south. The Pac-12 logos at the 25-yard lines are white-on-red making them stand out more than the red-on-white logos, and you won't see any remnants of the old Mountain West Conference logo. \nA red block “U” is still in the middle of the field, while the sidelines will be bordered in red up to the 25-yard lines and white between the 25s. Also the field has alternating, slightly different shades of green every five yards, although not as distinct as other fields like the one at Oregon’s Autzen Stadium. \n“We wanted to keep it simple, yet striking,’’ said Rice-Eccles Stadium Director Mark Burk, who added that Field Turf representatives told him it’s one of the most striking fields they’ve ever installed. \nThis is the third synthetic field the Utes have had since the 2002 Olympics. A new field was installed in early 2009 after the field suffered extra wear and tear because Real Salt Lake was sharing the field. Most turfs last about seven years and Utah was going to make the change after the season, but officials decided that now was a good time with a month between home games. \n“Sometimes you don’t realize how worn your carpet is until you take it up,’’ Burk said. \"This was a good time to make the change.'' \nThe FieldTurf is basically carpet with synthetic pieces of turf two and a half inches tall, which is filled in with sand, rubber and cork. The logos and letters are actually put separately into the turf, not painted, and the new surface is sewn and glued together “like carpet in your house,’’ Burk said. \nFieldTurf representative Jed Easterbrook said the Cool Play system, which includes a layer of light green cork over the small black rubber pellets, can make the field as much as 35 to 40 degrees cooler on hot summer days of August when the Utes often practice. \nThe Utes had grass fields until 1973 when Astroturf was put in at the old Rice Stadium. The Utes used that surface for 22 years until SportGrass, a combination of grass and syntethic turf, was installed. \nHowever, that surface didn’t work as well as expected and the Utah went back to natural grass in 2000 before changing to FieldTurf in 2002. \nThe former base was kept and after the old field was taken up, the new field was completed in less than two weeks with the final walkthrough last Friday. \nAfter Saturday’s game, the Utes will have four more home games this year – Arizona State on Oct. 17, Oregon State on Oct. 31, UCLA on Nov. 21 and Colorado on Nov. 28.
