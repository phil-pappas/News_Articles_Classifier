(Darren Abate / Associated Press) Broderick Turner Contact Reporter \nIt's not a stretch to say that six teams believe they can represent the Western Conference in the NBA Finals. \nOf course the defending champion Golden State Warriors aren't ready to give up their throne. But they will be challenged by San Antonio, the Clippers, Oklahoma City, Houston and Memphis. \nThe Warriors don't have history on their side. Only six NBA teams — Boston, the Lakers, Chicago, Houston, Detroit and Miami — have won back-to-back titles. \nGolden State does have the best-shooting guard duo in the league, in most valuable player Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. \nThe Warriors re-signed forward Draymond Green and have one of the deepest rosters in the NBA, with Finals MVP Andre Iguodala coming off the bench. \nThe Spurs should contend again after landing All-Star free agent LaMarcus Aldridge. They also kept their best young player by re-signing forward Kawhi Leonard for five years and $90 million. And San Antonio still has its championship core of Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili. \nThe Clippers survived the drama of the summer when center DeAndre Jordan snubbed Dallas to sign a four-year, $88-million deal to remain with the Clippers. \nClippers Coach/President Doc Rivers also loaded up his roster by adding Paul Pierce, Lance Stephenson and Josh Smith. \nNow it's time to see if the Clippers, led by Chris Paul and Blake Griffin, can get past the second round of the playoffs. \nOklahoma City looks as strong as ever. Kevin Durant, who broke his right foot and missed 55 games last season, is back to join Russell Westbrook, who led the NBA in scoring and triple-doubles. The Thunder has a rookie coach in Billy Donovan, but Durant and Westbrook will coach on the court. \nHouston will rely on James Harden's offense, Dwight Howard's defense and rebounding and the point guard combination of Patrick Beverley and Ty Lawson. \nThe Grizzlies will grind down opponents with center Marc Gasol, power forward Zach Randolph and point guard Mike Conley. \nNew Orleans, with superstar power forward Anthony Davis and new Coach Alvin Gentry, should make the playoffs again, but isn't quite ready to compete with the big boys in the West. \nWith six talented teams dreaming of a title, a key battle in the West will be waged in the regular season by trying to secure home-court advantage for the playoffs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:09:23.268+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
