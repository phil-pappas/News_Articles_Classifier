Half of the women were sexually active, half were abstinent.\nPrevious studies found that immune system changes occur during pregnancy, after childbirth and across the menstrual cycle, but this is the first research to show that sexual activity affects immune function, the researchers said.\n\"The female body needs to navigate a tricky dilemma,\" Lorenz said. \"In order to protect itself, the body needs to defend against foreign invaders. But if it applies that logic to sperm or a fetus, then pregnancy can't occur. The shifts in immunity that women experience may be a response to this problem.\"\nThe researchers found clear differences in immune system regulation between women who are sexually active and those who are not.\n\"We're actually seeing the immune system responding to a social behavior: sexual activity,\" Lorenz said. \"The sexually active women's immune systems were preparing in advance to the mere possibility of pregnancy.\"\nThe researchers also said these findings could potentially have an impact on treatments for autoimmune disorders in the future.\nThe findings were published recently in the journals Fertility and Sterility and Physiology and Behavior .\nMore information\nThe U.S. Office on Women's Health has more about trying to get pregnant .\nCopyright Â© 2015 ", "external_links": ["http://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy//before-you-get-pregnant/trying-to-conceive.html", "http://images.worldnow.com/Revenue/images/275529_G.jpg", "http://www.healthday.com/"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:29:55.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
