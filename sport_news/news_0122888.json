Photo By Eric Jenks, for the Times Union Photo: Eric Jenks Image 13 of 13 In UAlbany basketball scrimmage, Joe Cremo feels right at home 1 / 13 Back to Gallery Joe Cremo bounced from group to group on the SEFCU Arena floor, from people who knew him to University at Albany basketball fans who knew of him. It will be that kind of season.\nNow, Cremo just has to figure on better nights than Saturday's public scrimmage.\nCoach Will Brown basically said afterward the highly touted guard from Scotia has been \"a whole lot better than he's been (Saturday)\" during the first week of practices.\n\"I don't feel like I have to prove anything,\" Cremo said. \"But I do have to earn a lot.\"\nCremo still had seven points from a second-half 3-pointer, a layup and also a fancy floater off a one-on-one move that started at the top of the key.\nThe two-time state champion and Section II Class A MVP, playing mostly point guard and sporting a new number (3 instead of his more known 24) was on the winning team, 58-48, as the Gold upset Purple in the traditional scrimmage.\nIt's hard to say there were star players in an event that lasted just 32 minutes of mostly running clock, tucked after the UAlbany football game and before a soccer contest. Brown's team is still missing a few players to injury (even forcing a canceled practice this past Thursday). And the Great Danes spent much of Saturday outdoors at a tailgate with a group of fans who won the party at an off-season auction.\nThe three-time defending America East champs \"are going to play hard every second we're out there,\" said senior guard Evan Singletary .\nSingletary is one of those whom Cremo will back up. The local product also has to contend with Ray Sanders and Jamir Andrews , who looked a little more comfortable in the up-and-down setting.\nThe claps for Cremo seemed a little louder when he made something happen.\nBrown considered the scrimmage an \"honest night's work,\" and it didn't deteriorate into what many coaches use as a pejorative â€” an NBA All-Star Game .\nPeter Hooley started slow, but eventually hit a couple of 3s in quick succession for the Purple team in the first half.\nMike Rowley (Gold) buried a 3 with a hand in his face right before the halftime buzzer.\nSanders drew the biggest reaction, as the 6-foot-4 guard swatted the 6-1 Reece Williams at the rim shortly after halftime, which started to turn the game in the Gold team's favor.\n\"It's a great chance for us to interact with fans and our season ticket holders,\" Brown said. \"You're not going to be able to tell a whole lot. But I thought we played hard, and that matters.\"\nPlayers mingled afterward with friends and family as well as about 200 fans who attended.\nIt seemed like Cremo knew just about everyone. After about 20 minutes, as most of the arena emptied, he found himself in a circle with his new coach.\nHis parents (Michael and Mary) attended along with a couple of close friends. A third-generation Great Dane, Cremo joked that they drove \"all the way\" from Scotia.\nHis roommate is freshman Kyle McKinley , a center from Minnesota.\n\"I'm really comfortable over here,\" Cremo said. \"It's good.\"\nAnd it should get better, said Singletary.\n\"He's going to be fine. We push him, but he might even push us even harder,\" the veteran said. \"There might be a little disadvantage for him, because a lot of people out here will expect so much of him right away. But he definitely has an advantage in terms of fan support.\"\nJason Franchuk is a freelance writer.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809314/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809325/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809321/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809314/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809324/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809325/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809317/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809318/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809321/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809315/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809317/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809318/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809319/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809323/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809320/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809322/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809319/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809315/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809316/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809320/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809324/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809323/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809316/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809322/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T06:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:22:54.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
