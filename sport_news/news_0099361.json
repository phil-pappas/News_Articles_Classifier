They had five chances in Thursday’s 3-0 loss to the Canadiens in Montreal — including 1:41 of a 5-on-3 — and came away with nothing.\n“Obviously, that’s an area we haven’t been good enough [in],” Rangers coach Alain Vigneault said following practice Saturday at MSG Training Center. “We continue to work on it. I’m very confident we’ve got great personnel to have a really good power play. We’re going to see if we can get it going [Sunday].”\nWith that in mind, Vigneault made some changes Saturday, using defenseman Keith Yandle and Dan Boyle, along with forwards Rich Nash, Derek Stepan and Mats Zuccarello on his first unit. Captain Ryan McDonagh was the only blue-liner on the second unit, joined by J.T. Miller, Chris Kreider, Derick Brassard and Kevin Hayes. This also was an issue last year, as the Rangers finished the regular season 21st in the league and converted just 16.8 percent of their chances with a man advantage.\n“For a power play to be effective, you need good puck movement, you need shots, you need traffic, and obviously power plays are important,” Vigneault said. “They can give teams momentum. They can keep the other team honest. We’ve been working quite a bit on ours.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:53:02.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
