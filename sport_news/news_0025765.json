But, because the districts are operated by the U.S. Forest Service, the agency can't impose the fines.\nThe federal government can't fine other governmental bodies, so the Forest Service is off the hook for at least 10 safety violations, many electrical, at the Prairie City and Blue Mountain ranger districts. Inspectors with the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration have reported similar violations -- many recurring -- at 90 percent of all the Forest Service's ranger districts in Oregon national forests since September 2010.\nInspectors hand out citations nine out of every 10 visits to Oregon national forests for the last 10 years, according to the administration.\n\"Like the private sector, these dedicated federal workers deserve a safe and healthy workplace,\" said Ken Atha, the safety agency's regional administrator in Seattle. \"The Forest Service must ensure its workplace and housing are free from safety hazards.\"\nThe violation list includes:\nCircuit breakers missing blanks or breakers. Electrical junction boxes and outlets without covers. Failure to require employees to wear eye protection when working with caustic chemicals. Ladder flaws that could lead to fall hazards. Woodworking machines without devices to prevent restarting after power failures. Unacceptable guardrails that could cause dangerous falls. Unguarded terminals for welding leads. Failure to inspect fire extinguishers monthly. Seasonal housing with insufficient secondary fire exits. Inadequate employee hazard identification training. -- Molly Harbarger\nmharbarger@oregonian.com\n503-294-5923\n@MollyHarbarger", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MollyHarbarger"], "published": "2015-10-12T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:03:34.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
