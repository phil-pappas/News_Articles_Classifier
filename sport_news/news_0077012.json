Salisbury’s defense knows what it’s up against in the single-minded Bulldogs. “We know they’re a power team,” said Falcon senior linebacker Shane Wittman . Power would be the word for it. Northern Lehigh has 1,542 net rushing yards on 229 carries – an average of 6.7 yards per carry – and probably two-thirds of those yards came between the tackles. “They get off the ball well, they’re well-prepared and we know what’s coming,” Salisbury coach Andy Cerco said. “We have t step it up against the run.” The Falcons play a 3-5-3 defense where the linebackers such as Wittman, Devin Irwin and Nick Sikora will have to make most of the tackles once lineman such as senior defensive end Kyle Hartzell have done their job. “We have to know where we are, because there are so many linebackers to plug the holes. We can’t get in their way,” Hartzell said. Salisbury’s plans may be for naught, though, because … \nBulldogs bark with confidence on offense. Northern Lehigh ran for 373 yards against Catasauqua in last week’s 55-14 win and the Bulldogs are feeling it on offense. Northern Lehigh coach Joe Tout did something amazing for a football coach and admitted he was pleased with his team’s performance on offense, which means the Bulldogs must have been really, really good. “Offensively, we just have to do what we did in the last game,” said senior running back/linebacker CJ Young . “We think once we get going in a game, we don’t think our offense can be stopped.” Evidence of that: in six games, the Bulldogs have punted six times. And the Falcons may be really up against it, because of … \nKellen Hendrix’s emergence at fullback. The 5-foot-10 210-pound bowling ball of a fullback ran for 116 yards on 17 carries in the Catty win. “That’s the best game Kellen has had yet,” Tout said. “That really adds something to our offense, you can’t just key on (quarterback Chad Cederberg and tailbacks Taz McNair [120 yards vs. Catty] and Young). He wasn’t getting tackled by just one man, either. One play he must have carried four guys for six yards.” Hendrix’s presence in the middle could negate Salisbury’s stunts and blitzes that Tout expects to see. \nControlling Tevon Weber . Northern Lehigh may need all those rushing yards and all the points they generate, though, given the Falcons’ high-powered offense led by junior quarterback Weber. “I think he’s right there with Zach Thatcher (of Saucon Valley) and Tre Jordan (of Notre Dame), one of the three best quarterbacks in the league,” said Tout of Weber, who has completed 76 of 131 passes (58 percent) for 950 yards, 16 touchdowns and five interceptions this season. “We’ve been impressed with the multiple skills position players around, and (senior wide receiver Mason Donaldson ) is as good a wideout as we have seen (35 catches, 501 yards, 7 TDs).” But what makes Weber and Salisbury so tough to stop is … \nWhose turn is it to make a play? The Falcons have five rushers with long gains of 30 or more yards and six receivers with receptions of 23 yards or longer. Stopping Salisbury is not a matter of rushing Weber and shutting down Donaldson; it’s like a Chinese menu of options, two from Column A and one from Column B and any one of them can beat you. “We have to run the ball so we can open our passing game up,” said Salisbury senior running back Irwin. If the Falcons can achieve offensive balance they can be just as hard to stop as Northern Lehigh. So the key for both teams could well be … \nNo big plays. Salisbury will be happy to let the Bulldogs gain four or five yards a run. “Each game we’ve given up one or two big plays that hurt us,” Wittman said. “Like last week against Northwestern Harry Hall got a big run (72 yards) and they had a big kickoff return (for a touchdown). Without those plays we’d still have been in the game.” Tout feels the same about Weber’s array of weapons. “They’ll get their yards,” he said. “They just can’t make big plays.” \nConfidence critical. Both coaches said their teams are feeling better and better about themselves. “The kids feel their confidence building, and they believe in each other,” Tout said. Cerco pointed to his team’s 35-14 comeback win over Pen Argyl as a key. “Confidence is huge especially at a program like Salisbury,” he said. “In that game our players didn’t panic, there was a calmness about them. They were down 14-0, it was not a big deal, they knew they could come back.” Two confident teams could make for one exciting back-and-forth battle Friday night. \nPlayers to watch. For Northern Lehigh, keep an eye on pass-rushing defensive end Brandon Smith , who had three sacks last week and will be after Weber, and junior linebackers Brandon Belfonti and Tanner Filchner , whose continued maturity and knowledge of the defense has impressed Tout. For Salisbury, big defensive end Hartzell (6-3, 250) will play an enormous role in the run-stopping game, and Irwin and Wittman will be right there as well. And watch Donaldson on kickoff returns; the Bulldogs can be vulnerable to the big runback. \nBrad Wilson may be reached at bwilson@lehighvalleylive.com . Follow him on Twitter @bradwsports .
