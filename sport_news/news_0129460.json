Whether it’s on the first unit or the second unit, guys have to do their jobs because we do have a lot of valuable guys who are ready to play.”\nCasey insists it’s not a “competition” as much as it is “fit” that will determine who starts alongside Kyle Lowry, DeMar DeRozan, DeMarre Carroll and Jonas Valanciunas when things start for real Oct. 28.\nHis choice would seem to be narrowed to either veteran Luis Scola or Patrick Patterson, different enough players to give the Toronto starting unit a different look.\nScola made his first start of the pre-season Sunday as the Raptors registered an 87-81 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers, who were without LeBron James.\nThere’s not too much to be read into that, however. Patterson has started four games, Anthony Bennett was the starter Tuesday in Ottawa and Casey has yet to decide who’ll start the final pre-season game in Montreal on Friday.\nScola finished with eight points and three rebounds in 15 minutes, Patterson looked more aggressive taking three-pointers and finished with five points. The other candidate for power forward minutes, Bennett, finished up the game and had nine points as Toronto’s pre-season record ran to 4-2.\nThe game was a typical pre-season contest, at times quite sloppy — Toronto scored just five points in the first 10 minutes of the second quarter — and was riddled with lineups that will never see the light of day once the regular season begins.\nThe Cavaliers were without James, who had an injection for an ailing back, Kyrie Irving, still rehabbing an injury from June, and holdout forward Tristan Thompson, who is in a contract stalemate with Cavs management.\nCasey ran through the gamut of his available players and will just have Friday’s pre-season finale in Montreal to stretch out his regulars, a line that includes four key summer additions.\n“You’re still trying to get that chemistry (integrating four new players into the regular rotation), there’s a fine line between getting young guys looks and playing with your regular guys together and we had that luxury last year,” Casey said.\n“In practice we get a lot of reps of those guys together but still, we still want to see what the young guys can do in games.”\nFor the coach, however, it’s more what he sees in practices than games that will get him to the power forward decision.\n“We’re getting closer to it, we’re getting a good feel for it,” Casey said before Sunday’s penultimate pre-season game. “Again, it’s not one guy winning the job over another it’s one guy that fits as well as the other. Both guys are excellent at what they do — Pat as a three-point shooter, Scola as a passer, a reader, mid-range guy.”\nBut whatever happens, Casey is confident egos won’t be bruised. He’s seen teams struggle with personality issues, but he’s also seen veterans handle it well.\n“If you’re not a pro, it will (be a distraction),” he said. “If you’re not professional, if you listen to the noise, it will affect you. If you’re worried about winning, it won’t affect you, if that’s the No. 1 thing on your mind.\n“But if you listen to the noise or you’re about yourself or any other reason than winning or the team, it will affect you.”\nMore on thestar.com\nMaple Leafs’ Gardiner regaining his footing under Babcock\nBlue Jays turn to Marcus Stroman to make things right", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:40:14.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
