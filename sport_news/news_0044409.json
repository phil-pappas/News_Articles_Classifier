His decision has paid off with the Demons unbeaten at 5-0 after his game-winning kick at Montrose on Friday. Jerry McBride/Durango Herald Durango senior Nick Jernigan gave up soccer to become the football team’s kicker. His decision has paid off with the Demons unbeaten at 5-0 after his game-winning kick at Montrose on Friday. I n the final seconds of the Montrose game last Friday, Durango High School senior placekicker Nick Jernigan’s journey as a two-sport athlete came to a defining moment. Jernigan always played football growing up and was a skilled kicker and enjoyed playing wide receiver. But, when he got to Durango High School, he opted to play on the boys soccer team. As a junior, Jernigan scored eight goals and had four assists for 20 total points, third most on a very talented team. But, this year, Jernigan, son of Linda and Randy Jernigan, felt it was time to return to the football field. After missing an extra point and shanking a kickoff early in the football game pinning two top-10 teams in Class 4A, Jernigan was called upon to kick the biggest field goal of his life, and he was more nervous than he’d ever been. His team had fought their way back from a 35-26 deficit in the fourth quarter, and he kicked a perfect onside kick to give the offense an opportunity for a game-winning drive in the final minutes. The Demons drove down the field and got all the way down to the three-yard line. With five seconds left on the clock, they needed a 20-yard field goal to complete a miraculous comeback victory in enemy territory and stay undefeated on the season. “I was kind of just praying that the guys would score, honestly,” Jernigan said. “Montrose called timeout twice and tried to ice me, which is totally nerve racking because I had three minutes to think about this field goal I needed to make after missing one from the same distance earlier. “One of my teammates was telling everyone to stay away from me, and I told them ‘No, I need you guys to talk to me here,’ so we huddled up and prayed a little bit.” Jernigan is no stranger to big games against the Montrose Indians. He played a big role last year when the Demons’ boys soccer team beat Montrose 2-0 to claim the Southwestern League championship. But Jernigan said helping the football team end a four-game losing streak to Montrose was an even better feeling. Jernigan isn’t completely new to the football team, though. He played football in elementary and middle school, and when the football team found out he was considering a change from soccer to football, they urged him to put on some pads and get on the field. “He was our kicker in middle school and he was really good,” said senior quarterback Terrence Trujillo, son of Geno and Nicole Trujillo. “The whole team tried to convince him, and we were all in his ear trying to get him to come kick for us again. I’m glad he did.” After the series of timeouts Friday, Jernigan jogged onto the field. The snap was good, Trujillo put down a good hold, the kicker took his steps, struck the ball and closed his eyes. “It really went down in a blur,” Jernigan said. “I had my eyes closed, and I heard our side in an uproar and the Montrose side dead silent. My teammates just tackled me, and I knew what happened.” The kick finished off an incredible 36-35 comeback win for Durango and, more importantly, justified Jernigan’s difficult decision to leave one sport he loved for a shot at another. “I love soccer,” he said. “But it’s always fun to try something new.” Sports editor John Livingston contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T16:40:33.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
