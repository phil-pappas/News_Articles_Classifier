The South Carolina head coach is retiring, effective immediately. (Video via WPDE )\nBut for a man who's been coaching college football since the '70s, Spurrier's not-so-good season won't have much of an impact on his legacy.\nInstead, Spurrier will be known as the head coach who made the University of Florida a program to be reckoned with in the '90s.\nHe had a combined 122-27 record between 1990 and 2001 there, including a national title in 1996.\nThe Heisman trophy-winning quarterback-turned-head coach probably won't be remembered for the Gamecocks' recent struggles on defense.\nWhen people think about his time in Columbia, they'll think about how he was the only coach to lead the team to an 11-win season, and he did it three times.\n\"To the Carolina fans, I feel fortunate. I'm thankful to be the coach here. And I pledge to you: You're going to get my best shot,\" Spurrier said as he was introduced as South Carolina's head coach in 2004 .\nBut perhaps most important? People will remember Spurrier for his quick wit and always saying what was on his mind.\nSpurrier has always had a way with words, whether it was taking jabs at Florida State or Tennessee, nothing was off limits for him, especially what he liked to refer to as \"talkin' season.\"\n\"Last thing about Georgia and players suspended. I said I always like to play them early because they always have some players suspended. ... They asked the athletic director, 'Are you upset Spurrier said that?' He said, 'How can I be upset when it's true,'\" Spurrier said during an SEC Media Days conference .\n\"Our kickers? Gee. It's like the Army â€” left, right, left, right. They're kicking it all over the place. I don't know if we can beat anybody this year,\" Spurrier said jokingly to reporters .\nWho knows what's next for the wise-cracking Spurrier.
