Students will be seen in a different dress code. Instead of the traditional black robes and square hats that are worn by students during the convocation since the British rule in India, students will wear the traditional white kurta and pyjama. Male students have been directed to wear kurtas and pyjamas with black shoes and female students will wear white sarees with red border and black leather shoes or sandals. The faculty of the university have also been directed to wear either kurta and pyjama or full sleeves white shirt and white trousers. The students have also been allowed to wear cream colour jackets if it is cold. The new dress code has been loaded on the website of the university. The students said earlier they used to get black robes on rent for the convocation. However, now as per the new directive of the university, they would have to get new kurta and pyjama stitched. The decision seems to be in tune with the decisions being taken across the country to undo the traditions being carried out during the British era. The spokesperson of the university said the decision to change the dress code during the convocation was aimed at simplifying the dress of students. There was nothing more to it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:22:03.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
