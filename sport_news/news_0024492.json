Pleasant News \nNoble “Cozy” Cozine has been competing successfully in lifting competitions since he was in high school. Since then, he has broken multiple world and American records. \nCozine has competed 14 times in the WUAP (World United Amateur Power Lifters) bench press competition, and just recently won his 12th title, this time in the 55-59 year old master equipped bench press competition at the 270 lbs weight class. This year’s event was held at the Central Illinois Performing Arts Center in East Peoria, Illinois. \nIn the WUAP competitions, each lifter gets three shots at a bench press of whatever weight they want. The competitors’ first press must be the lowest weight tried. After their first, they may go up in weight or stay the same. \nCozine opened at a weight of 391 lbs., which he says he knew would be enough for him to win the competition. His first lift was unsuccessful, so Cozine decided to stay at 391 lbs. for his second try. \nHe was able to complete the lift on the second try, and nobody else competing could quite make it to that limit. Cozine then attempted to break the world record, at around 469.75 lbs., but was unsuccessful. He had previously held the record at 457 lbs. at the 2011 competition in Atlanta, Ga., which was the last he had competed in before this year, but he was surpassed in the time in between. \nThe 59-year old Cozine says he can’t always make it to the world championships, which move from city to city each year. His first world championship competition was in Austria in 1998, where he was victorious. He finished second one year when the event was held in Canada. \nCozine says the world record was on his mind coming in, but that winning the event is most important. \n“When you get to the nationals or the worlds, my first goal was to win the meet,” he says. \nCozine, who says he started out powerlifting to get prepared for high school football, says his best lift ever was 529 lbs. He also competes in the Iowa Games and made a top lift of 445 lbs. this year and 440 lbs. in 2014. \nCozine has competed in a variety of lifting events, but has just recently been focusing his time towards the bench press. In this year’s world championships, he competed in the “equipped bench press” competition. \n“Shorty after I turned 45, I set the American records for the bench, squat bench, dead lift and total,” he explained. “The last ten or so years, I’ve just been bench pressing.” \nWhen Cozine first started competing, there weren’t different classes for teenagers or novices, so everybody competed against each other. He says he still looks at the competition outside of his age range. \n“When I was younger, I was motivated to beat the older guys,” says Cozine. “Not that I’m older, I’m motivated to beat the younger guys.” \nCozine’s workout regiment consists of many different types of lifting exercises. He says he is more explosive than strong, so he works on speed reps as well as power reps to keep up his advantage. \nHe says his main workout partner has been his son, Coedy Cozine, who has helped him throughout his years as a power lifter, and is strong enough to spot him on the heavier weights. \nCozine says he’s undecided on whether or not to compete in next year’s world championships. He will be 60 when the championships roll around again, and would be moved up to the 60-64 age range.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:30:20.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
