Ross Barkley eventually made the breakthrough after stepping inside his marker and curling a right-footed shot beyond Arlauskis and in off the post.\nArlauskis, who was excellent throughout, was unfortunate to be credited with England's second. After a neat reverse flick from Adam Lallana found Harry Kane, the Tottenham striker hammered a shot at goal which cannoned off the keeper and into the net in the 35th.\nKane should have netted his second after the interval, but following another excellent stop from Arlauskis, he sent his follow up into the ground allowing it to bounce up and cleared.\nAlex Oxlade-Chamberlain added a third in the 62nd lashing into the roof of the net after being played through by Kyle Walker.\n\"To get ten wins out of ten is never easy in these qualifying groups so we've got to be satisfied with it and take a bit of pride in it,\" Hodgson added.\nElsewhere, second-placed Switzerland beat Estonia 1-0 after an own goal from defender Ragnar Klavan in fourth minute of second-half stoppage time.\nThe already-qualified Swiss finished on 21 points, nine adrift of England but five ahead of third-placed Slovenia.\nSlovenia will face a playoff after ending its campaign with a 2-0 away win to San Marino. Second-half goals from Botjan Cesar and substitute Nejc Pecnik sealed the win.\nEstonia and Lithuania finished in fourth and fifth, respectively having collected 10 points.\nBottom-placed San Marino lost nine of their ten matches, with its sole point following a goalless draw at home to Estonia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:49:23.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
