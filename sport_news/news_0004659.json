He hit seven boundaries during his 143-ball stay. \nBut it was Cook's third double century that enlivened an otherwise dull day. \nCook flicked paceman Wahab Riaz to backward square-leg for two to complete his double century off 395 deliveries, the second of the match behind Pakistan's Shoaib Malik's 245. Cook has so far hit 16 boundaries in a 407-ball stay. \nRoot also batted with authority, reaching his 14th Test half-century with a reverse sweep boundary off Malik. \nPakistan were once again sloppy in the field as they missed another chance to dismiss Cook when wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed failed to take an inside edge off Riaz when the England captain was on 173. \nFawad Alam had let off Cook on 147 off spinner Zulfiqar Babar on Thursday. \nRoot also survived a confident leg-before shout when fast bowler Imran Khan trapped him but Pakistan's review once again went unsuccessful. \nRiaz was the pick of the bowlers with 3-116. \nPakistan's frontline spinner Babar also struggled to take a wicket, conceding 132 runs in his 58 overs.
