Steve Glasson had an early shock that turned him towards bowls and away from banking. \nGlasson (46) did work experience in a local Sydney bank for a week when he was at secondary school. \n''When I was there we were held up by an armed gunman,'' Glasson said. \n''It scared the living daylights out of me and turned my interest in the finance industry sideways.'' \nGlasson switched to bowls and became an apprentice greenkeeper at a local bowls club. He has been the Australian national coach since 2011. \n''It was a good choice,'' he quipped. \n''Bowls is nowhere near as crazy as an armed hold up.'' \nGlasson was the top-ranked bowler in Australia from 1997 to 2005. \nHe won a World Bowls team medal in 2000 and became the singles champion - the first from Australia - at World Bowls in Scotland in 2004. \nHe was runner-up in the World Bowls singles and the triples in 2000. \nHe won the first of his 20 Australian titles in 1994 and the prestige Mazda Jack High title in 1997. \nDespite his success, Glasson was not selected for the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne in 2006. \n''It was a big disappointment for me at the time,'' Glasson admitted. \nThe Australian selectors wanted a huge time commitment and ''I was just a normal married guy with four kids''. \n''We had regular camps and I thought it was a waste of time since I had been in the game for so long. \n''The selectors were justifying their existence and we had a bit of a clash over certain things. I had my thoughts and my philosophies and was a bit stubborn.'' \nThese experiences have helped Glasson in his job as a national coach and selector. \nHe tries to individualise player preparation and understand the players' other life commitments. \n''I try to support them as best I can,'' he said. \n''It's a very fine line. It's helped me to become a more commonsense coach.'' \nAustralia has been the dominant nation in world bowls this century and is keen to retain its top rank. \n''We are a proud bowls nation and have good greens and facilities,'' Glasson said. \n''We also have player depth and a rich culture and history.'' \nAustralia has more than 1900 clubs and bowls is a strong participation sport that is well supported by the Australian Institute of Sport. \nRegistered player membership is down slightly to 495,065, but Bowls Australia has tried successfully to grow the sport using new methods. \n''We have social bowls, business house bowls, corporate bowls and Jack Attack and the Australian premier league,'' Glasson said. \nThe Jackaroos record has been impressive under Glasson's leadership and Australia has been one of the dominant countries at World Bowls and the Commonwealth Games. \nIt is taking positive measures to prepare for World Bowls in Christchurch next year. \n''We have already had two camps in Christchurch,'' Glasson said. \n''It's good to play against good local bowlers in their own conditions. \n''It's great experience for our players to come to Dunedin to show their wares and learn off the locals,'' Glasson said of the Speight's Invitation singles event which finished yesterday at the North East Valley club and was won by Australian Brett Wilkie. \nThe Australian team is also competing at the Burnside pairs and transtasman test in Christchurch this summer. \nThe Australian team to compete at World Bowls will be named in March or April next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:19:05.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
