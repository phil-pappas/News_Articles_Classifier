We are very proud of our kids to go on the road at Clinton and win. Clinton is a tough place to play.”Dardanelle (5-0, 2-0 4A-4 Conference) went 1-for-3 on PAT kicks and 0-3 on field goals. The Sand Lizards were forced to get those points back late in the game on 2-point conversions.Chris Kershner had three touchdowns in the first half. Caden Brown added another from the 2-yard line. Daniel Craig added a touchdown in the third quarter and Caden Brown the 2-point conversion to squeak in the Mercy Rule.“We were very pleased with our defense,” Price said. “They created turnovers. Our defensive backs made great plays. We did a good job of keeping guys in front of us and giving up big plays. It’s another big win. We will take it.”Dardanelle will host Arkansas Baptist on Friday for homecoming.
