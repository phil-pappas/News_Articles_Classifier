I just stand behind him and watch in awe as he runs sometimes.” \nOf course, Coker is nowhere near as dynamic or gifted a runner as the Tide’s starting quarterback last season — Blake Sims, who’s gift for swift helped him make the transition to running back as a redshirt freshman in 2011. \nThankfully, with Drake and bruising junior tailback Derrick Henry in the backfield, Coker hasn’t had to be. \nBut when he has taken off on his feet, good things have happened. \nDiscounting any negative yardage plays, Coker has rushed for 153 yards this season, 135 of which have come in the last four games, including 36 yards on four runs last weekend against Arkansas. \n“Hey, I’m just trying to get a first down and do what we need to do,” Coker said. “If it takes running the ball I’ll do it.” \nNine of his 18 runs for positive yards over the last four games have either gone for a touchdown or a first down, including three huge scrambles of 15-plus yards in a failed comeback bid against Ole Miss that went for a combined 56 yards. \n“He’s showing his athleticism, you know?” Tide redshirt freshman guard Ross Pierschbacher said with a laugh this week. “(He’s a) big dude, he’s saved us a couple times on third downs and stuff like that, making big runs. It’s fun to see that.” \nAt least part of that fun is being had by Coker, a strong-armed signal caller from Mobile whose recent rush of athleticism helped him nail down the starting job after being considered a co-starter through the first three weeks of the season. \n“It’s been a lot of fun, just playing and doing what you have to do,” Coker said last week. “It’s a fun game.” \nThat fun was on full display in Alabama’s first true road game two weeks ago, when Coker and the Tide ground game demolished host Georgia 38-10, during which Coker managed to flash his quick feet with a 2-yard bootleg touchdown to put the Tide up 38-3 midway through the third quarter. \nLast weekend against Arkansas, when the Tide were nursing a 10-7 lead entering the fourth quarter, it was a 15-yard run by Coker that seemed to provide an emotional spark. \n“It’s never him trying to make a play, it’s just doing his job,” Tide senior center Ryan Kelly said after the 37-10 win. “There’s multiple times he could have thrown the ball out of bounds, but he knows what this offense needed at that point was a first down, and that’s what he did.” \nOf course, some — even a few of Coker’s own teammates — have been taken back by his maneuverability. \n“A lot of people didn’t guess that he would have that ability, too,” Drake said. “All the different things he can do on and off the field gives all the people around him an edge, and we rally around him.” \nSince being named Alabama’s starting quarterback ahead of the Louisiana-Monroe game three weeks ago, Coker has grown exponentially as both a leader and a playmaker within the Tide offense. \nUpon entering in the second quarter against Ole Miss, Coker has combined to throw for 811 yards and nine touchdowns on 73-of-125 passing (58.4 completion percentage). \n“The confidence, game-in and game-out, is obviously there,” Drake said of Coker. “Before he was more of a quiet, reserved guy, but now he has a lot more fire on the field and that is something we rally around with him being our quarterback.” \nAnd Coker’s quick thinking and pocket presence when he opts to take off on both designed runs and non-designed runs have only strengthened that team dynamic. \n“Yeah, it’s fun to see him have success in that part of his game that he’s not known for or whatever,” Pierschbacher said. “It just brings all of us up and makes us play harder and show that he’s fighting and doing the stuff he needs to do and scrapping for a win.” \nSo, whether it’s a previously hidden skill or just his sheer will to win, Coker’s newfound ability as a running threat has Alabama’s players believing anything is possible. \n“It’s been probably every game now that he’s been able to do something with his feet,” Kelly said last week, before adding: “I guess he’s turning into a dual-threat quarterback.
