That’s right, 25. \nThere is not enough space to list them all now, and some will barely be noticeable, but when the season begins on Nov. 13, fans will notice some changes instantly. \nHere are some significant tweaks and how some of the Big Ten coaches are approaching them: \nNEW RULE: The shot clock has been reduced from 35 seconds to 30 seconds. \nCOMMENTS: Ryan knows that some teams will try to press in the back court, forcing a team to use more time bringing the ball into the front court. That will leave less time to get a quality shot. \n“We already have our press break in just in case,” Ryan said. “We practiced with 17-second shot clock before we went to Canada two years ago and we got shots off. The only problem is they were some of the ugliest possessions you’d ever want to see. \n“But I think 30 seconds is enough time to get a good shot.” \nRutgers coach Eddie Jordan said the change won’t matter. \n“I’m excited about pushing the ball and taking the first open 3,” he said. “I told our guys who have the ability, if it’s an open 3 and there are 22 seconds left on the clock, go ahead and shoot it. They like that.” \nNEW RULE: Guarding in the post. Arm bars are now allowed in the post area when the offensive player has his back to the basket, with or without the ball. \nCOMMENTS: Many coaches, including Ryan, are skeptical about how consistently calls will be made. Purdue’s Matt Painter is one of the skeptics. \n“As an officiating unit, you have to stick with whatever you’re going to do,” Painter said. “If you call it close in November, you have to do it in March. A lot of times that hasn’t happened.” \nThat will be important for Purdue, which has three NBA-caliber post players who will test the new rule. \nNebraska coach Tim Miles sounds like a coach who will like the freedom to be more physical in the post. \n“I’ve coached in NAIA, Division II and Division I, and for whatever reasons, the best games are always the most physical games.” \nNEW RULE: Coaches can only call a timeout during a dead ball situation. No longer can a coach scream for a timeout when a player is trapped in a corner. \nCOMMENTS: Miles hates this rule and most coaches admit it’s going to be a hard habit to break. \n“It’s our livelihood at stake so I’d prefer to have control of that,” Miles said. \nMichigan State’s Izzo thinks the college game should stop tweaking the rules from season to season. His solution: Listen to the pros. \n“If I was the czar I’d have every rule like the NBA. We’d have a better working relationship and it would make more sense.” \nIzzo said that includes playing four quarters (not two halves) and using a 24-second shot clock. \n“I always hear, ‘We don’t want to be like the NBA.’ Why not? That’s what the kids want. I love some of the NBA rules, personally.” \nRyan just wants consistency. \n“We’ll see how they are going to call the rules and we’ll try to get as much help as we can by communicating with the Big Ten office. We’ve already had officials into our practices to see how these rules will be called. I’ve only had 18 disagreements with them so far.” \nIn the end, though, Ryan will lean on what always matters the most. \n“It’s still going to be, you’ve got to put the ball in the basket and stop the other guys from putting the ball in the basket.” \nThat rule hasn’t changed. \nmtupper@herald-review.com|(217) 421-7983 Executive Sports Editor of the Herald & Review Follow Mark Tupper Get email notifications on Mark Tupper daily!
