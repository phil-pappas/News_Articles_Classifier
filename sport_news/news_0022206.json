It paid off, as Ward won the 100-lap Limited Late Models feature at Ace Speedway and a grand total of $8,000. “All I’ve wanted to do all week,” Ward said, “is go from the rear to the front.” Ward, of Winston-Salem, took the lead for good in the 86th lap. He said that his previous experiences in this race, where he has qualified well before, played a major role in his decision making. “I just have had bad luck and had to come from the rear to the front at the end of the race,” he said. “So I figured that if I started in the rear, maybe I could win it.” Ward furiously moved up to the front of the 26-car field, thanks to six early cautions. He moved into first place during the 22nd lap. He held the leading spot until the 67th lap, earning himself a $500 halfway-leader bonus. The race was littered with interruptions, as there were 14 cautions and three stoppages. Laps under caution don’t count toward the total, extending the race to nearly 2½ hours. Ward said the cautions helped his car. “After every caution, I felt the car getting better and better,” Ward said. “I was a little bit tight, and then it kept freeing up and freeing up, and at the end, honestly, I’ve had the best car I’ve had in a while.” His brother, Trevor Ward, led the race for the first 15 laps. But after the fifth caution, he couldn’t get his car started properly. A huge pileup occurred right out of the restart, taking out six of the top 10 up to that point. Ross Dalton of Liberty took the lead in the 67th lap, but lost it to Dylan Ward within 20 laps. Dalton was black-flagged later in the race for an improper exit from pit row. All the profits for the Mischa Sell Memorial went to the Jack & Jill Late Stage Cancer Foundation. These included ticket sales, concessions and donations from spectators. ■ In the Midget feature, Chris Lamb of Greensboro won the race, leading all 35 laps. It was his third straight victory in Midget races at Ace, as he also won Saturday night’s race in the division. Dillon Silverman of Charlotte took second and Matthew Lundstrom of Concord finished in third. Kyle Craker of Lewisburg, Pa., and Andrew Layser of Collegeville, Pa., won the Midget heat races. ■ For the Limited Late Models heat races, Gary Young Jr. of Gibsonville won the first heat. Matt Thomas of North Miami, Fla., won the second heat. Page 2 of 2 - ■ On Saturday in Street Stocks, Donnie Martin of Winston-Salem claimed the victory.
