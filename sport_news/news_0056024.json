The healthy scratches might skate, but that's it.\nAnd now on this two-game Southern California road trip, which began at Anaheim on Friday night, the Avs are doing the morning work at the team hotels and going to the arenas only once, not until late afternoon.\nI long have felt that morning skates are outdated, unnecessary and even counterproductive.\nBut in a sports world that tends to unquestionably buy in to the theory that if \"B\" follows \"A,\" then \"A\" caused \"B,\" and coaches often react defensively to avoid second-guessing, Roy probably will feel pressure to go back to conventional morning skates if the Avs struggle through the first 15 games or so.\nEven if that's the way the things play out, I again would offer up the phrase from the study of statistics (no, not analytics): \"Correlation does not imply causation.\"\nRoy should stick to his plan, variations of which have been tried throughout recent years in the NHL — but haven't caught on. The Avalanche coach decided to do this as a continuation of his relentlessly touted \"partnership\" with the players, and in consultation with captain Gabe Landeskog, among others.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:06:31.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
