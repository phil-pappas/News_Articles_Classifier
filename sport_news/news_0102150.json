Jones had allowed just two goals in the Sharks season-opening winning streak and came in leading the NHL in goals-against average (0.49), save percentage (.982) and shutouts (2). \nOther NHL News \nKings cancel second practice of month due to ice problems \nEL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) — The Los Angeles Kings' practice schedule is on thin ice these days while power outages plague the neighborhood around their training complex. \nThe Kings were forced to cancel the on-ice portion of practice Monday for the second time this month because the ice at the Toyota Sports Center wasn't playable. \nThe area just southeast of Los Angeles International Airport has endured multiple power outages in October. The training complex is also home to the Los Angeles Lakers. \nThe Kings didn't know about the bad ice until it was too late to find another rink for practice. They are participating in a charity golf tournament Tuesday, which means they won't get back on ice until Wednesday. \nLos Angeles has won two straight games after losing three straight to start the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:23:33.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
