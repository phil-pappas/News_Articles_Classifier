It's the only way to put it.\"\nPatrick Mahomes threw for 359 yards and a score and De'Andre Washington rushed for 160 yards and a TD. Washington shared Kingsbury's sentiment.\n\"The offense just didn't come through,\" Washington said. \"The offense just didn't come to play, really. It's all it was.\"\nThe Red Raiders (5-2, 2-2 Big 12) racked up 225 yards rushing and a touchdown on the ground. Texas Tech's 30 points were the least amount the team has scored all season.\nFive different Texas Tech offensive playmakers recorded over 50 yards receiving. Zach Austin led the Red Raiders with 80 yards receiving, Jakeem Grant had 76 yards, Devin Lauderdale had 50, Cameron Batson, 58, and Reginald Davis, 57 yards and a score.\n- Associated Press\nComplete Texas Tech coverage\nCLICK HERE TO VISIT THE TEXAS TECH RED RAIDERS PAGE\nFive thoughts: Injuries shackle Texas Tech against Kansas, takeaways come to rescue\nTexas Tech quotable: Slow start falls on Kingsbury; head coach lauds defensive effort\nPhotos: Texas Tech connects on deep passes in win over Kansas\nWATCH: Texas Tech's 308-pound OL Le'Raven Clark barrels across end zone\nTalk Texas Tech football with Chuck Carlton in a live chat at 2 p.m. Thursday\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/17/five-thoughts-injuries-shackle-texas-tech-30-20-victory-kansas", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/17/texas-tech-quotable-slow-start-falls-kingsbury-head-coach-lauds-defensive-effort", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texastechredraiders/2015/10/17/photos-texas-tech-connects-deep-passes-win-kansas", "http://dallasnews.stats.com/cfb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=201510170020&home=20&vis=86&final=true", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texas-tech-red-raiders", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/chats/2015/10/17/chuck-carlton-answers-big-12-questions-2-pm-thursday-oct-22-ask-now", "https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/17/watch-texas-techs-308-pound-ol-leraven-clark-barrels-across-end-zone-two-point-attempt"], "published": "2015-10-15T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:42:47.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
