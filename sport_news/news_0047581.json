Their shots were decidedly off (a combined 0-for-21 on three-point attempts). And there were times of general confusion.\nBut there was one scene that was memorable.\nAfter the 24-minute scrimmage was over, and Damian Lillard was awarded the MVP trophy, one player remained on the court: Meyers Leonard.\nAs his teammates were peeling off their jerseys in the locker room, Leonard stayed and worked on his shot at the north end of the court.\n\"I wanted to see the ball go in that rim,'' said Leonard, who was 3-for-10 on the night. \"I've been working on my mental structure, preparing for the season and everything, and tonight I got caught up too much in the outcome.''\nIn other words, during the scrimmage he was worrying about his shots going in too much rather than trusting and following through on his proper technique. Several times, Leonard appeared off balance on his shots, usually drifting to his left.\nSo after the game, Leonard re-visited his normal shooting routine: touch shots around the rim followed by 25 mid-range jumpers and 25 three-pointers.\n\"It wasn't something I needed to do, it was just something I wanted to do,'' Leonard said. \"It was more about the process.''\n\"Process\" has become quite the buzz word with Leonard, who is expected to challenge for the starting power forward spot as the Oct. 28 season opener nears. A physical specimen at 7-foot-1, 255-pounds, Leonard can out run and out jump most players he faces. But as he enters his fourth season, he has found older players separate themselves because of their mental approach.\n\"It's more about the process and committing to my shot and being ready,'' Leonard said.\nI point out the postgame shooting session because this is the approach – and example -- that this young Blazers team must embrace. More often than not, the opponent will be more experienced than the Blazers. And more often than not, the opponent will be more talented.\nWhere young and over-matched teams can sneak up and steal victories is with effort and dedication. That means getting in extra repetitions. Arriving early to the arena to get in work. And even staying after to put up shots or lift weights.\nTo see Leonard doing that Sunday, after a scrimmage, meant more than any of the turnovers, missed shots or sloppy play.\nOnto some observations of Fan Fest:\nRaised eyebrows\nTwo players raised my eyebrows: Ed Davis and Noah Vonleh .\nDavis rebounds everything. Everything. The 6-foot-10 power forward is long (a little thinner than I thought) but he doesn't get pushed out of the way easily.\nDavis, a free-agent signee who played for the Lakers last season, finished with 11 rebounds and had a block. He also had a nice interior bounce pass to Tim Frazier. His free throws look like they will be an adventure (career 56.6 percent shooter from the line), as the lefthander knuckleballed two of his four attempts on Sunday. Not sure he will be much of an offensive force, but he will be a factor. I asked Damian Lillard who stood out to him, and he noted Davis:\n\"In pick-and-roll defense he was active,'' Lillard said. \"He was talking, he was confident. You can tell in his voice in how he communicated that he was sure of what he was doing. The way he crashed the glass and the way he rolled to the basket ... I thought he did a really good job.''\nVonleh, the second-year forward acquired from Charlotte in the Nicolas Batum trade, made some nice athletic moves for a big guy. He showed some nice body control making an open court layin in early in the game and then displayed some agility by leaping for a rebound that was headed out of bounds and finding a teammate while hanging in the air. He also showed nice hands poking away the ball from one of jitter-bug point guard Tim Frazier's drives. He made 2-of-4 shots, including a mid-range jumper.\n\"Noah didn't surprise me tonight, because I know he has a lot of game to him,'' Lillard said. \"He's a big who can catch it and put it on the floor, he can make a jump shot. He's really skilled and patient in the paint, which is something you guys didn't get a chance to see tonight, but hopefully over this long season everybody will.''\nOff night\nAfter pickup games and practice, players were raving about the athleticism and talent of Moe Harkless , but on Sunday, the forward was out of sync.\nOne of the unknowns with Harkless is his outside shot. Two seasons ago in Orlando, he made 38 percent of his three-pointers (59-of-154). Last season, he made 18 percent (10-of-56). On Sunday, he looked more like the 18 percent shooter, badly missing both of his attempts (one an uncontested airball).\nHe also couldn't take training-camp invitee Omari Johnson off the dribble, and had a turnover trying to create a shot while driving in the lane. And on the game's final play – a breakaway – Harkless sent a windmill dunk off the back of the rim.\nHe did make the game-deciding free throws with 5.4 seconds left, and followed a CJ McCollum miss with a dunk, but if the Blazers are going to surprise people this season, Harkless will need to be one of those players who exceeds expectations.\nThe breakout\nMany are expecting CJ McCollum to have a breakout season (me included), and the third-year shooting guard seemed eager Monday to prove he is worthy of the attention. He shot a scrimmage high 15 times (making 6) and I'm not sure he passed more than once or twice.\nAfter a rough start, particularly in finishing at the rim, McCollum looked as regular-season ready as anybody. He made a nice step-back jumper, had a confident drive to his left to score over the good defense of Allen Crabbe, and made a delicate floater. It was a sampling of what will make McCollum such an offensive weapon this season: he has an array of shots and is one of the few players on the roster who can create his own shot. It also looks like he has the confidence and intent on being a high-volume shooter. I don't think it's out of the question for him to average 17, 18 points a game this season.\nThe roster battles\nThe Blazers will have to cut two players before the season, and one of them will almost certainly be one of the backup point guards – either Phil Pressey or Tim Frazier .\nAt first blush, I would say Pressey has the advantage over Frazier.\nFrazier had some moments, making a nice entry pass to Leonard, but he had trouble finishing at the rim and had three turnovers – including one that was stolen by Pressey.\nPressey, meanwhile, looks smaller than the 5-foot-11 he is listed at, and he dribbles an awful lot, but he appears to have a better shot than Frazier and for one scrimmage at least, he took care of the ball better.\nThis will be an interesting battle to keep tabs on.\nI would guess that Luis Montero will be the other cut. My first impressions are the 22-year-old looks a little out of place on an NBA court right now.\nOdds and ends\n*Always amazed at the enthusiasm and passion at Fan Fest events, and Sunday was no different. A crowd of 13,934 filled the lower bowl and bled into the upper deck, topping last season's crowd by nearly 500 fans.\n*Newcomer Al-Farouq Aminu arrived for the game, but then left after his wife, Helina, went into labor. No word if the couple's first child was delivered Sunday night.\n*Veteran center Chris Kaman and rookie Cliff Alexander didn't play. Alexander is nursing a sore left knee and Kaman had what coach Terry Stotts called a \"variety\" of ailments.\n*The Blazers locker room had widespread shuffling. The most prized locker stalls are the four corner stalls and they are given to players of stature and/or experience.\nLast season, the four corner stalls were LaMarcus Aldridge, Chris Kaman, Nicolas Batum and Robin Lopez.\nThis season, Lillard has taken over Batum's corner stall and Gerald Henderson now dresses where Aldridge resided. Kaman keeps his stall by the door, and Ed Davis assumed Lopez's space.\nLillard and Henderson have the best real estate because the stalls are at the end of the row, thereby giving them extra room to dress (Davis and Kaman are at the end of the row, but butted the wall).\nSince I started covering the team in 2000, Lillard's stall has been occupied by Rasheed Wallace, Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Brandon Roy and Batum.\n*Didn't feel like Mason Plumlee played much Sunday, but I liked what I saw. He scored on a jump hook inside and showed he is adept at using both hands. He also recorded two blocks – one on a McCollum drive and another on a Davis put-back attempt. Plumlee might turn out to be the biggest offseason acquisition.\n-- Jason Quick | jquick@oregonian.com | @jwquick", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jwquick"], "published": "2015-10-05T06:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:31:33.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
