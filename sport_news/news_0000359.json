The Centre has also sought transfer of the case to the Delhi High Court where a similar case was pending. The Supreme Court (SC) has agreed to hear on October 26 the Centre's plea against the relief granted to Himachal Chief Minister Virbhadra Singh in the case. The relief was granted to Virbhadra Singh by the Himachal Pradesh High Court in the form of protection from the CBI interrogation and filing of chargesheet without the court’s permission. An apex court Bench headed by Chief Justice HL Dattu also agreed to hear Centre's another plea for transferring the case to the Delhi High Court as a similar case was pending there. Appearing for the Centre, Additional Advocate General PS Patwalia said the transfer was necessary for two reasons. One, the CBI registered the FIR in Delhi. Second, two judges of the Himachal Pradesh High Court had recused from hearing the case. The Supreme Court Bench said both the petitions would be taken up on the first working day after the Dussehra holidays next week. The Himachal Pradesh HC had on October 1 restrained CBI from arresting Singh and his wife in the DA case but had allowed the enquiry in the matter to proceed.\nAdmitting the petition of Singh against, the high court had also directed CBI to keep the court informed before interrogating the couple.\nThe chief minister had filed a petition in the high court pleading that the raids on his private residence and other premises were conducted with \"malafide intentions and political vendetta\" by the central investigating agency.\nSingh in his petition had alleged that the CBI had overstepped its jurisdiction in filing the case and questioned how the agency could raid his premises when the case was already pending in the Delhi HC and also before the Income Tax tribunal and other Income tax authorities, where all documents relating to his returns have been submitted.\nVirbhadra had sought directions from the high court to quash the FIR registered against him and his wife under Sections 13(2) and 13(1) (e) of Prevention of Corruption Act and Section 109 of IPC by CBI on September 23 here in Delhi.\nThe Delhi HC is also hearing a PIL filed by an NGO, Common Cause, alleging that Singh had received unaccounted money to the tune of nearly Rs 5 crore.\nIt also referred to his revised IT returns for the years 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2011-12 and claimed that it showed an increase in agricultural income to the tune of Rs 6.10 crore.\nThe IT department, in its status report filed yesterday in the Delhi High Court, had contended that it has the locus standi to probe the matter as the properties under question were also located in the national capital. —With PTI inputs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:45:06.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
