Sometimes as a striker you need a bit of luck to come your way and I got that today and you have got to be ready to take your chances when they come. \n\"I'm delighted to get the three goals and get the ball rolling so overall it is a good day.\" \nKane has emerged as Mauricio Pochettino's undisputed first-choice forward over the last year but was only a substitute for Thursday night's Europa League defeat to Anderlecht. \nHe was carrying a knock on his knee which he picked up in the recent draw at Liverpool but he came off the bench to miss two gilt-edged opportunities in Brussels. \nHis knee was still strapped up at Bournemouth but, with Tottenham's next game not until next Monday night against Aston Villa, Kane insists he will not face any sort of spell on the sidelines. \nWhen asked if he is fully fit, Kane said: \"Not far off. \n\"It was a little niggle I picked up against Liverpool towards the end of the game. We didn't want to risk it in midweek, the manager makes his decision on who wants to play but I was fully fit for today. \n\"I was always going to be playing and it showed with the performance. The strapping was just a precaution, we haven't got a game for eight days now so by then it should be 100 per cent.\" \nManager Eddie Howe refused to blame anyone for Sunday's loss despite the glaring errors from ex-Southampton goalkeeper Boruc. \nThe 35-year-old keeper also felt he was not the only one at fault and suggested the whole team now need to work hard as they prepare for next weekend's south-coast derby against his former club. \n\"Some people say that but that isn't how it is,\" he said when asked if he was to blame for the goals conceded. \n\"Talking is not going to do any good to me just now. As a football club we need to take our a**** back to the training ground and work hard on some of the things we need to do. \n\"I will get down to the training ground and try and prove myself - I have nothing more to say.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T14:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:24:13.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
