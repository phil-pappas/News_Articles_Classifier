That would have made for a sticky personal situation, as his wife Lauren was pregnant with the couple’s fourth child. Traveling clear across the Atlantic Ocean and possibly missing a blessed event was not a comforting scenario.\nAs it turned out, Cassel had nothing to fret about.\nHe never made it to London with the Bills, instead getting traded to the Cowboys on Sept. 22. Then he was promoted into the starting quarterback job, and Saturday, with the Cowboys sitting out on their bye week, his wife gave birth to a healthy baby boy.\n“God works in mysterious ways, I tell you what,’’ Cassel said Wednesday.\nNo one could have anticipated any of this. Now, Cassel is days away from making his 2015 debut, facing the Giants on Sunday at MetLife Stadium in an NFC East game both teams desperately need to win.\nCassel has not thrown a pass in a regular-season game in more than a calendar year. His 2014 season with the Vikings ended after three games when he broke his foot against the Saints. Since then, he has been traded twice. In March, the Vikings shipped him to the Bills, where Cassel failed to beat out Tyrod Taylor for the starting job. Expendable in Buffalo, Cassel was shipped to the Cowboys after Tony Romo went down with a broken collarbone, summoned to back up Brandon Weeden.\nAfter three starts, all losses, the Cowboys had enough of Weeden and picked a smart time — their bye week — to make the change to Cassel . The 33-year old inherits the keys to the Dallas offense, as Romo is on short-term injured reserve and cannot play until Nov. 22 at the earliest.\n“Brandon got three starts for us and really did a lot of good things,’’ coach Jason Garrett said. “But when we evaluated three parts of it — how he played, how our offense as a whole played and how our team has played — we just felt it was the best thing for our team going forward to give Matt Cassel the chance to be our starter.’’\nIt has been a long and winding career for Cassel. He never even started a game at USC, kicked around the NFL playing for five different teams. His heyday came in 2008 with the Patriots, when Tom Brady was lost for the season in the opening week, and Cassel stepped in and helped New England go 11-5. Cassel started for four years in Kansas City, and has made nearly $60 million as he’s bounced from team to team.\nThe Giants know of Cassel based on his 11 years in the league, but they have not gone against him since 2009, when they beat him and his Chiefs, 27-16, in Kansas City. There is no Giants defensive player on the roster remaining from back then. Cassel is 35-38 as a starter — 24-33 since leaving the Patriots.\n“When he gets comfortable back there, he can play as good as most quarterbacks,’’ Giants defensive lineman Cullen Jenkins said.\nWhere Weeden was ultra-conservative, unwilling to gamble in fear of making a mistake, Cassel is more of a risk-taker and far more accomplished than Weeden.\n“He’s a veteran player and he’s played a lot,’’ Garrett said. “I think he understands how to lead a team, and I think he’s physically capable of doing everything we’re asking him to do.’’\nNew to the Cowboys’ offense, Cassel has had to acclimate to his new surroundings and the new playbook. Everything is new as he steps in and attempts to stop the losing.\n“You never know in this league,’’ Cassel said. “I never counted myself out.’’\nCassel will no doubt need all the help he can get, but it looks like he won’t be getting any from Dez Bryant. There was some noise recently that the star receiver was going to try to return for this game, but he did not practice on Wednesday and is highly unlikely to be ready to face the Giants. Bryant had surgery Sept. 14 to repair a fractured fifth metatarsal in his right foot, an injury he suffered in the season opener against the Giants.\n“Hopefully I’m not rusty at all and we go out and we win,’’ Cassel said. “I’ve played a lot of football in my career. I’ll be ready to go.’’\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under brandon weeden ,  dallas cowboys ,  jason garrett ,  matt cassel ,  new york giants", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:21:46.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
