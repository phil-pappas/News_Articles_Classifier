They don’t need to get too much stronger to be a real threat at this Rugby World Cup.” \nFantastic Pumas \nIreland had a frenetic preparation for the sudden-death encounter, losing fly-half Johnny Sexton, captain and lock Paul O’Connell and flanker Peter O’Mahony to injury. Star flanker Sean O’Brien was suspended for throwing a punch in their final pool game against France last weekend. \n“That’s the nature of the game. Its attritional,” a philosophical Schmidt said, praising the replacements who were called up to start the match. \n“As difficult as it is to be going out of the World Cup at this stage, it was a fantastic Argentinian performance and I think it was a performance our players will learn from. \n“There’s a lot of players who have never, ever been in a match of that intensity. Hopefully that learning experience will offer something in the future. I can tell you, the dressing room is very disappointed.” \nArgentina had the measure of Ireland in the forwards where Pablo Maera, Leonardo Senator and Tomas Lavanini controlled the collision area and they stationed a couple of their heavier players out wide to smooth the path of their outside backs. \nIt was a repeat of the way Argentina beat South Africa 37-25 in Durban this year, and although Schmidt had suspected that would be the Pumas’ approach, Ireland were not able to shut them down. \n“We were very conscious that was potentially what they could do and we had to be ready to stop that and while the players worked hard we weren’t quite able to do so,” the New Zealand-born coach said. \n“I think their combination of power and pace made it very difficult for us to win collisions either side of the ball.” — AFP-Relaxnews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:34:44.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
