Cox, a California native who joined the Bobcats this summer, scored 32 points as the Bobcats rallied for an 81-67 victory. (CHRIS JASTER/BRANDON SUN) \nIt took a game and a half for Keisha Cox to find her groove with the Brandon University Bobcats women’s basketball team, but once she did she showed she can dominate. \nWith the Bobcats trailing the University of Manitoba Bisons 43-36 at the half of an exhibition game at the Healthy Living Centre on Saturday, Cox took over. She started finding lanes and driving to the hoop, hitting shots from all over the court, or collecting her rebound and draining them if she missed her initial shot, and finished with 32 points in Brandon’s 81-67 victory. \nShe stood out in her own zone too, pressuring opponents, snaring boards and even blocking a shot. \nFor the five-foot-seven guard from Oceanside, Calif., she just felt she was doing what was expected of her. \n\"We all have our roles. Scoring is one of my roles,\" said Cox, who was vocal and helped her teammates find open players in the offensive end. \"I figured it was time to step up and get this game going. It was too close. We were neck and neck, we were down by 10 points and had to get stops. Our stops turned into buckets, as you can see. \n\"The funny thing about defence is I’ve never been a defensive person. Me actually playing defence these past two games is showing I’m in shape, honestly. It’s just hard work. That’s all it takes is hard work.\" \nCox committed to join the Bobcats this summer after spending a couple years at junior college. She averaged 18.5 points, 7.8 rebounds and 5.2 rebounds per game last season while helping the Palomar College Comets to a 13-1 Pacific Coast Athletic Conference record. The team fell in the California Community College Athletic Association’s south regional final. \nWith dreams of playing in the WNBA or professionally overseas, Cox decided to follow one of her best friends, Mikaela Stanton, to Brandon to continue her education and university basketball career. Stanton is redshirting this season with the women’s basketball team. \nThere is a difference from the international rules played in Canadian Interuniversity Sport and those in American college basketball, but Cox feels she’s picking it up pretty quickly. \n\"It hasn’t really been much of a difference, it’s just the pace of the game and slowing it down,\" she said. \"In the States you’re used to transition and here you actually break it down step by step and you’re running plays. It’s just really fundamental out here. That’s the only difference.\" \nCox was happy with how the Bobcats performed in their three-team tournament, which included a 58-56 loss to the University of Regina Cougars on Friday night. Regina was without its top post in Alyssia Kajati, but the result was a massive improvement from last season when Brandon lost by 23 in the pre-season and 47 and 18 in conference play to the Cougars. \nBobcats head coach Novell Thomas was also impressed with how his team played for the most part and sees a lot of potential in his squad. \n\"Just overall happy with how we battled,\" said Thomas, who wants to see his team’s fitness level improve. \"I was happy that we could play 12 players, glad that we were able to turn things around without one of our post leaders in Lauren Anderson. I’m excited to see how we grow.\" \nRegina beat Manitoba 98-56 in Saturday’s other game. \nThe Bobcats have next weekend off before hosting Dakota College at Bottineau on Oct. 17 and 18. \n» cjaster@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:40:38.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
