Legally, it is to beat them, which is exactly what Republic did to Willard thanks to another ridiculous game by Jones, who rushed for 200 yards and three touchdowns on 25 carries. If that wasn’t enough he tacked on a 55-yard TD reception for Republic, who continues to cling to the No. 2 seed in the district. Watkins, the sophomore quarterback, continues to be a silent assassin, rushing for 178 yards and a pair of touchdowns on 13 carries and also completing both of his passes for 60 yards and that touchdown to Jones in Republic’s 49-35 win. Helmet Stickers Ethan Brown & Seth Hedrick, Waynesville – Let’s just say moving Hedrick back to receiver has worked out for all parties involved. The standout senior caught six passes for 143 yards and three touchdowns in Waynesville’s first win over Camdenton since 2007. He also had a 33-yard touchdown run. Brown, just a sophomore, completed 10 of his 13 attempts for 291 yards and five touchdowns with no interceptions. Waynesville is 3-2 since Brown took over at quarterback. Zach Brown & Keegan Chrisco, Rolla – Glendale is widely considered to have the most prolific passing attack in Missouri, but Rolla gave them a dose of their own medicine in a 61-44 win on Friday. Brown, a 6-foot-4 senior, completed 20 of 29 attempts for a school-record 410 yards and six touchdowns. He added another score on the ground, rushing for nearly 100 yards. His favorite target on the night was Chrisco, who racked up more than 200 yards and five touchdowns. He also had a 99-yard pick-6. *SEE CHRISCO’S PICK-6 HERE* Jordan Dean, Marshfield – Dean continues to be one of the best dual-threat quarterbacks in the Ozarks. The senior completed 18 of his 22 attempts for 206 yards, but also rushed for 162 yards and three touchdowns in Friday’s loss to Central. Ryan Devore, Carl Junction – The Bulldogs hung 35 on a very good Monett defense, led by its senior signal-caller. Devore competed 20 of his 25 attempts, throwing for a season-high 285 yards and three touchdowns. Four Carl Junction receivers finished with 50 yards or more receiving. Mark Duley, Joplin – He’s a stud on the baseball field, but the 6-foot-4 junior is still giving Lebanon nightmares after his five-tackle, two-sack performance from his defensive end spot. Duley also blocked a punt, recovering it in the end zone for a touchdown and the cherry on top was his 12-yard touchdown reception, the second consecutive week he’s caught a touchdown. Diamond Offensive Line – Diamond won four games all of last year, but through seven games under Ben Glidewell already have five wins. The Wildcats potent run game was on display Friday night, racking up 529 yards on 46 carries, led by 100-yard rushers Blake Drake (13-191 TD), Triston Shepherd (14-166 4 TDs) and Hunter Renfro (11-130 2 TDs). Jerrett Esposito, Greenfield – Esposito’s numbers in 8-man are like Arena League numbers. He was good offensively, rushing for 81 yards and three touchdowns, as well as a 55-yard touchdown reception. But, he was unstoppable defensively, tallying eight tackles (5 TFL), forcing three fumbles, recovering four fumbles (two of which were scoop and scores) and even breaking up a pass. Garrett Hadlock, Jarrett Massie & Peyton Oehlschlager, Mount Vernon – In the ‘Neers first win over Cassville since 2002, Mount Vernon’s offense looked like the Cowboys of the 1990s. Hadlock (Troy Aikman) and Massie (Michael Irvin) connected for two touchdowns, with Massie finishing with 122 yards on just four receptions, including the game-winner with three minutes left. Hadlock finished 12-for-17 with 252 yards. Oehlschlager (Emmitt Smith) rushed for 170 yards and a score on 19 carries. *SEE HADLOCK-TO-MASSIE GAME-WINNING TOUCHDOWN HERE* Ian Holyfield, Central – The Bulldogs have won three straight, averaging 51 PPG in those wins, and the emergence of guys like Ian Holyfield is the reason why. On what is an already loaded offense, Holyfield gives Quinton Batson another option for defenses to worry about. On Friday he caught 10 passes for 148 yards and a touchdown. He’s averaging nearly 20 yards per reception in 2015. CLICK HERE FOR HOLYFIELD'S HIGHLIGHTS Hunter Yeargan, Willard – The COC-Large is just counting the days until this kid is doing lacing ‘em up for Willard. Republic won the fight, but Willard and Yeargan got some licks in, with the senior rushing for 249 yards and three touchdowns on a workman-like 31 carries. VIDEO: In the Zone - Week 7 Recap Perfect just the way you are… Kickapoo (7-0) – at Lebanon, at Waynesville Webb City (7-0) – at Ozark, vs Branson Carl Junction (7-0) – vs Seneca, at Lamar Reeds Spring (7-0) – vs Central, at Bolivar Lamar (7-0) – at Aurora, vs Carl Junction MV-BT/Liberty (7-0) – vs Salem, vs Houston Marionville (7-0) – at Skyline, vs Stockton Skyline (7-0) – vs Marionville, at Tipton Lockwood (6-0) – at Miller, vs Jasper Jasper (6-0) – vs Windsor, at Lockwood If you wanna crown ‘em, then crown em… The conference races are decided for the most part. Webb City essentially has the COC-Large wrapped up. Same story for MV-BT/Liberty (SCA) and Kickapoo (Ozark Conference). The remaining leagues will come down to one game. Marionville and Skyline will decide the Mid-Lakes this week, while everyone else must wait for Week 9, which should hold three conference championship games with Bolivar and Reeds Spring (COC-Small), Carl Junction at Lamar (Big 8) and Jasper at Lockwood (SRVC). Class 5 gives me a headache… Seriously. There has been minimal separation in Class 5. Early on it looked like Nixa would be the favorite to make a return trip to St. Louis, with Carthage and Willard being their biggest challengers. But, now I’m not so sure. In fact, I’m sure of anything in Class 5. Carthage is the favorite right now by a narrow margin over Nixa. But, keep in mind that Neosho upset Nixa and was a two-point conversion away from beating Carthage. However, Willard rallied and beat Neosho on the road. But, Willard lost at home, on homecoming, to rival Republic. And let’s not forget that Sedalia Smith-Cotton is sitting out there with a huge 42-14 win over Republic, but that same SC team was nearly upset by 2-5 Nevada. You look at the Ozark Conference and there are more than a few questions. Parkview has looked like a legit contender, but keep in mind they started 1-4 with a loss to Waynesville. Those same Tigers started out 0-2 with a loss to Lebanon, but just waxed Camdenton for the first time since 2007. Camdenton is 3-4, but three of those four losses came to the top of the conference (Kickapoo, West Plains and Lebanon). Speaking of Lebanon, the Jackets looked like they could be in for a deep playoff run, but after back-to-back losses to West Plains and Joplin, that picture looks a little bleaker. One thing is for sure, these next two weeks will be huge, especially for playoff seeding. The one thing to note is what the seeding means and don’t think that it’s not important. Yes, there is a chance that a hot team can have momentum killed with a bye week, but not playing and advancing always trumps stepping on the field in a game that you don’t have to play. We will have a full district preview following Week 9. Sleeping Giants?! Alright, so all season we’ve been assuming the Class 4 and Class 2 are useless in debating because of Webb City and Lamar. But, again, we sit entering Week 8 and Carl Junction and MV-BT/Liberty have perfect 7-0 records and are seemingly on a collision course with the perennial powers. Yes, both CJ and Liberty have met, and gotten blasted by, Webb City and Lamar in recent years, but is this the year the dominance ends? Each makes a compelling case. Carl Junction has outscored opponents 350-73 this year, with the narrowest margin of victory coming against state-ranked Monett in a 35-0 victory on Friday. The biggest key is not only has Carl Junction been explosive offensively, which could be trouble for a Webb defense that has been vulnerable at times, but the Bulldogs currently have the best defense since Coach Buck has been at CJ. This is also the best offensive and defensive line groups he’s had, headlined by sophomore Zeke Wall, the biggest key in upsetting Webb City… Liberty has outscored opponents 288-80 with only Ava scoring more than two touchdowns against the Eagles. Darin Acklin again has a team that is confident and playing at a high level. And, as is becoming a tradition in Mountain View, the offense features several speedy options with a dual-threat quarterback in Josh Pruett running the show. There is still a ton of football to be played, but it will be interesting to see if either one of these programs is finally ready to challenge the current power structure in its respective class. NOTE: Webb City has ended Carl Junction’s season eight times since 2006, while Lamar has beaten MV-BT/Liberty in the playoffs in four of the last five seasons. Week 8 Games to Watch Class 1 No. 2 Marionville (7-0) at Class 1 No. 3 Skyline (7-0) – Someone asked me why I always talk about Marionville and if I knew that Skyline actually made it to the Final Four, which is further than Marionville. While it is true that the Tigers made it to the semifinals, while the Comets got bounced in the quarters, what seems to have been lost is the fact that Marionville crushed Skyline 48-21 in the regular season. Friday’s game will decide the Mid-Lakes crown, but it is also a huge game for the psyche of each team entering the postseason. Both have been nearly untouchable throughout 2015, trying to keep pace with each other, as well as potential Class 1 challengers Jasper, Lockwood, Thayer and Lincoln. In what will likely be both the KY3 and KSPR Game of the Week, there are several key games within the game to keep an eye on. First, if Tanner Wright doesn’t play this game will look very different than the matchup we anticipate; his speed and play-making ability is elite at the Class 1 level. But, assuming both teams are relatively healthy, the trenches will be the biggest key. Last year Marionville owned the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball. If that’s the case again Wright and Jacob LaSalle will run wild behind one of the grittiest hog units in the area. That line, headed by Waylon Davis defensively, can also force Skyline to be one dimensional and open the door for the Comets’ ball-hawk defensive backs to make plays. On the flipside, Skyline has more athletes than Marionville will see all season, even if they happen to play Valle Catholic again. When that Skyline offense gets rolling it is tough to stop, especially because they can stretch the field horizontally and vertically. Madison Davis is one of the most difficult covers in the area and the fact that he’s in Class 1 just isn’t fair. Throw in Dylan Mountain, Chipper Berry, Shawn Bryan and Tyler Swearingin and good luck stopping this team. It will be a battle of wills. If it turns into a shootout you have to like Skyline’s chances, but if it becomes a bar fight, which Marionville thrives in, the Tigers will be in trouble. On paper, there is no better game than this one in Week 8. Central (4-3) at Class 3 No. 8 Reeds Spring (7-0) – Reeds Spring continues to get no love and much of it boils down to the strength of its schedule, or lack thereof. The Wolves seven opponents are a combined 10-32. Clearly, the competition hasn’t been there, but that doesn’t mean this team can’t play. As Lance Gosch teams have done in the past, they run the football and play sound defense. But, they haven’t seen anything like what they’ll see on Friday night. I’ve said it before, there are few teams that can rival Central’s athleticism at the skill positions. Last year Reeds pulled out a 13-6 win on the road. Central is in need of a win to continue to keep pace in the district seeding race. The Wolves will get an early preview of what they’ll see Week 9 with Bolivar with the Bulldogs spreading the field with playmakers, hopefully they aren’t looking ahead. Class 5 No. 10 Nixa (4-3) at Class 5 No. 7 Carthage (6-1) – I love this one. Nixa has won four of the last five meetings, including beating the Tigers twice last year, with the final game ending Carthage’s season in the Class 5 quarters. Nixa is still good defensively and Carthage seems as potent as ever offensively, with Keith Guess II and Trey Collins taking over the reins. The big key will be the health of Logan Tyler. Nicos Oropeza has been running like Will Smith in I am Legend, giving the Nixa offense an added element to game plan for, in addition to the vertical threat of D-1 prospect Chase Allen. Nixa can manage offensively without Tyler; Andrew Rivera has been impressive spelling him. But, an unhealthy Tyler makes that defense suspect and the secondary vulnerable, which isn’t a good thing with guys like Dausen Gourley lining up on the outside for Carthage. With both teams trying to grab home field throughout districts, this game becomes increasingly important. A Nixa loss opens the door for Republic and Parkview, while a Carthage loss makes it impossible to catch Smith-Cotton. It is extremely plausible that these two teams meet up again in roughly five weeks. Neosho (5-2) at Republic (4-3) – See the game above. Neosho and Republic are trying to avoid playing in the opening round of districts. Republic leads Parkview by 1.3 points and Central 3.2. The Tigers end the season with Neosho and Nixa. Two wins and they are the No. 1 seed, but a pair of losses could drop them to fourth. Neosho is in a similar spot. The Wildcats are No. 4 in the district, trialing Belton by four points and Carthage by nearly seven. But, with Willard sitting in fifth, Neosho would be dropped an additional spot because Willard would win a challenge by virtue of head-to-head. So, it is imperative that Neosho beats Republic and Ozark in order to jump Belton. On the field, the game plan is simple; stop the opposing stud running back. Jerney Jones and Devin Hames have been horses all season and it is safe to assume whoever has a bigger game likely leads his team to a big win. Camdenton (3-4) at Joplin (5-2) –The conference race may be over, but these two teams are still jockeying for district spots. If Joplin wins out there is a strong chance they could end up in the two-spot in Class 6 – District 4 and avoid making a trip to Kansas City this year. Meanwhile Camdenton is sitting in fourth in Class 5 – District 4, but because Waynesville is fifth, the two teams would switch seeds after a likely challenge. While 4/5 will play each other in the first round, where they play will mean a lot. Camdenton has struggled defensively against spread teams and Joplin is about as explosive as they come, but the Eagles, until Friday’s win over Lebanon, had struggled with power-running teams. This game is still huge despite Camdenton’s record. Parkview (3-4) at Class 4 No. 6 West Plains (6-1) – Parkview beat West Plains last year, forcing the Zizzers to share the OC crown. Anthony Riley rushed for 165 yards and a pair of touchdowns in that game. Well, he’s back and West Plains has been decimated by injuries defensively. With the Vikings still in the hunt for the top seed in districts, and with West Plains trying to hold off Carl Junction for the No. 2 seed, both teams have plenty to play for.
