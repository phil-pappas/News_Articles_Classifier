Chargers management has made it clear since breaking off negotiations with the City of San Diego in June on proposed $1.1 billion stadium in Mission Valley that it believes the franchise’s only viable option is to move into a proposed $1.75 billion stadium in Carson with the Raiders.\n“There’s no way to foresee the future, of course,” said Mark Fabiani, a senior advisor to Chargers owner Dean Spanos. “But the last owners meeting the head of the LA NFL owners committee said that he expected all three teams to file for relocation, and nothing has changed since then to alter that assessment, at least for the Chargers.\n“We do not intend to give up our share of the LA and Orange County markets without presenting our certain LA option, at the Carson site, to the NFL's owners for decision.”\nPittsburgh owner Art Rooney, a member of the NFL’s Committee on Los Angeles that is guiding the final stages of the relocation process, said earlier this month he expected the Chargers, Rams and Raiders to all apply to move to the Los Angeles-Orange County market when the league’s relocation application window opens January 1. Rams owner Stan Kroenke wants to move his franchise from St. Louis to a $1.86 billion stadium in Inglewood on the former site of Hollywood Park.\nRams and Raiders officials did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe relocation window runs through February 15. The NFL’s owners could vote as early as January on which teams will be permitted to relocate. Franchises need the approval of 24 of the league’s 32 owners to relocate.\n“The target (for a vote) is January,” Rooney said.\nWhile Spanos has significantly more than the nine votes needed to block Kroenke’s plans to return the Rams to Southern California, the Chargers owner currently does not have 24 votes, according people familiar with the relocation process.\nRaiders owner Mark Davis is in talks to secure a minority owner in the Los Angeles area, which the Raiders and Chargers believe would further bolster their case for relocation to the Carson facility. The Chargers believe the Carson facility would also be financially viable with only one team.\nUSC is willing to host an NFL team at the Coliseum for the 2016 season. NFL officials continue to have talks with other venues about serving as a temporary stadium for relocating franchises.\nNFL senior staff is holding public hearings on potential relocations in St. Louis Tuesday, San Diego Wednesday and Oakland Thursday.\nContact the writer: sreid@ocregister.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/s-nfl.logo.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/s-nfl.logo.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:26:53.328+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
