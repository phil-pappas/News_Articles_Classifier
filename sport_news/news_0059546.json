And while the commercial concerts have been big business, other groups are also using the events center to showcase their efforts in a big way. \nEvents center employees spent the day preparing the arena for Chicago's famous comedy troupe--The Second City. It's another big event for the Sioux Falls Area Chamber of Commerce annual meeting. \n\"It's a Chamber event; it's also a huge community event. It just kicks the year off in a tremendously positive fashion,\" Evan Nolte, President/CEO Sioux Falls Area Chamber of Commerce, said \nYou may remember that the band Chicago was one of the first acts to take the stage at the Denny Sanford PREMIER Center for the Chamber's celebration last year. That concert attracted 3,400 people, more than double the usual attendance. \n\"It's that additional amenity that really puts our community another notch or two up,\" Nolte said. \nIn August, the United Way kicked off its annual campaign called \"Start with Heart,\" with the band Heart taking the stage. That took the United Way's annual kickoff event from 400 in attendance to more than 8,000. \n\"And part of it was having it at the PREMIER Center. It's still a showcase. A lot of people haven't seen it; it's a beautiful setting to do this type of thing,\" Jay Powell, President of Sioux Empire United Way, said. \nWhile First PREMIER Bank and PREMIER Bankcard footed the bill for the United Way's Heart concert, the Chamber of Commerce will use its revenue to pay for Tuesday night's event, which will run well over $50,000. \nBut no matter who's picking up the bill, organizations say these big showcase events are proving to be worth the cost. \n\"We were trying to get the message out to new givers, to people who have not heard about United Way--invite them to the concert. But a lot of what we found happening were our regular volunteers and Heart Club members were just a little more excited about United Way because it had a little more pizzazz to it,\" Powell said. \nThe first two companies out of 700 to complete their fund raising drives are up $35,000 in donations from last year. And the buzz created by these big acts has both groups looking at how to top it next year. \n\"It's a Sioux Falls thing to do something really well and now we have the venue to do it in,\" Powell said. \nThe Sioux Falls Area Chamber has 2,200 members. Tickets for members for Tuesday night's program were $80 per person. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
