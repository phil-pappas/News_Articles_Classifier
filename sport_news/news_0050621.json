The Golden Gales are used to having success after winning a Division I district championship in 2013 and a district runner-up finish in 2014. \nThis version of the Gales (8-9, 4-8) started the season on a good note, but as the year as progressed, their inconsistent play has held them back. \n\"We have struggled all season,\" Lancaster coach Jeff Lewis said. \"I'm at a loss with this team because they are a very, very talented team. They haven't found themselves yet, and as a coach, that is my biggest failure this year is not helping them do that. \n\"It's just been a lack of inconsistency. We just seem like we can't ever do it as a group. One night, the hitters are on, and the next night, the passers are. We just aren't putting it together. It has been tough year for all of us, it really has. We are not used to struggling like this.\" \nLancaster couldn't have asked for a better start in the first set as the Gales seemed to be clicking on all cylinders and jumped out a 12-3 lead. The Raiders never recovered as the Gales cruised to a 10-point victory. \nIn the second set, things were a little tighter. Lancaster led throughout, but the Raiders kept it close until the end. In the third set, Lancaster led throughout, but Reynoldsburg outscored the Gales 16-4 to pull out a win and force a fourth set. \nThanks to solid play from Maddy Allen, McKenzie Bates, Sam Taylor, Lexi Matheney, Kristen Appleton, Rachael Leitnaker, Emily Cordle and Maddie Dawson, the Gales jumped out to a 12-6 lead. \nThey were able to hold on after the Raiders rallied from a 17-10 deficit to cut the margin to 21-19. Lancaster, however, scored the final four points to close out the set and the match. \nBates led the Gales with 34 assists and seven digs, Taylor had 12 kills and four blocks, and Allen finished with 25 digs. \nAlthough the Gales have struggled, Lewis said he thinks they are talented enough that if they can find some consistency in the upcoming postseason tournament, they could surprise some teams. \n\"I think we have a chance to do something good in the tournament, I really do,\" Lewis said. \"We will see. We have the capability of putting things together, and if we do, we can surprise some people because they aren't expecting much from us.\" \ntwilson@lancastereaglegazette.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:17:30.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
