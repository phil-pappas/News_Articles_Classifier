The Belgian has been sidelined since mid-September with a calf problem. \n\"We are working hard as a team\" said Hart. \n\"We appreciate we are quite an attacking team so we can leave ourselves a little short at the back sometimes and it's something we want to improve, but we want to improve all over the pitch to be the team we want to be.\" \nWhile goalkeeper Hart is understandably focused on City becoming harder to score against, Kevin De Bruyne, who grabbed the winner in stoppage time against Sevilla, said it was their commitment to attack that earned the points on Wednesday. \n\"Even though we didn't have our best game, in the end we tried everything to look for the victory and thankfully in the end we could score,\" De Bruyne said. \n\"To get a draw [in Spain] isn't that bad but I think we have a team to attack. Sevilla are very good in possession but we will try to get the three points there too,\" he added. \nManager Manuel Pellegrini heaped praise on De Bruyne, calling him the \"perfect player\" for the club after the 24-year-old midfielder scored his fifth goal in nine appearances. \n\"We bought Kevin because we knew is a very creative player who can score and create goals and in that respect he was the perfect player to bring to our club,\" Pellegrini said. \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:47:56.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
