United with three regular season games remaining.\nMontreal played most of the match with 10 men after defender Ambroise Oyongo was sent off in the 15th minute for a deliberate handball on the goal-line.\nHis sacrifice was in vain, as Sacha Kljestan converted the subsequent penalty for the Red Bulls. Ten minutes later, the Red Bulls were awarded a second penalty but Impact goalkeeper Evan Bush saved Kljestan's shot.\nSam doubled New York's lead on the stroke of halftime before former Chelsea striker Didier Drogba pulled one back for Montreal in the 68th minute, also from the spot.\nThe defeat, the second in a row for Montreal, cost the Impact a chance to consolidate a playoff spot. They remain sixth in the East, one point ahead of Orlando City in the race for the final berth in the post season.\nIn the other Wednesday game, the Vancouver Whitecaps and FC Dallas played out a scoreless draw, a result that better suited visiting Dallas.\nThey edged to the top of the West, equal on points with the Los Angeles Galaxy, and one clear of Vancouver.\nThe top two teams at the end of the regular season get a first-round bye in the post season.\n(Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Julian linden)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T09:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:14:57.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
