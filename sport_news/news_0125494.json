They trailed for most of the way, including at 43-48 after three quarters, but turned the tables on RDAK using a 19-11 run in the windup. \nJair Igna unloaded a game-high 21 points and Flacher Galvez nailed 16 markers but to no avail as the Stallions could not sustain their momentum after stunning Goldberry in the series opener. Lucky Ecarma and Adrison Gaviola finished with 10 points apiece in a losing cause.
