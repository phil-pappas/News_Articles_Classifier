Then, one of their leading offensive weapons -- wide receiver Byron Marshall -- underwent surgery and will likely be lost for the season. And the Ducks -- who in January played for the national championship -- fell out of the Top 25. \nNow comes word that one of last season's most dynamic offensive threats is in hot water, still. Related Content \nWide receiver Darren Carrington, who was suspended for the College Football Playoff championship game against Ohio State as well as the first five games this season, recently was cited by Eugene, Oregon, police for having an open alcohol container. \nThe issue could further complicate Carrington's path to getting back on the field. \nCarrington trailed only Marshall last season as the Ducks' No. 2 receiver. He caught 14 passes for 291 yards and three touchdowns in his last two games in 2014 -- the Pac-12 title game against Arizona and the playoff semifinal win over Florida State. \nAccording to The Oregonian in Portland, police cited Carrington on Sept. 26 after \"officers on 'party patrol'\" spotted him in an alley at 2:34 a.m. with a cup that appeared to contain alcohol. \nOregon officials are aware of the situation but have not said if the 20-year-old will be eligible to come off suspension next week against Washington State.
