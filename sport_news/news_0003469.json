Being Mrs. Rudy Giuliani can't be easy, but at least it pays well - about $10,000 a month.\nA day after the former mayor disclosed in federal filings that he considers his third wife, Judith, a salaried employee, sources said he has paid her about $125,000 a year for speechwriting help - since before they were married.\nThe tidy sums, which the couple have always reported as income on their joint tax returns, was for speech-writing help and the many days Judith spent traveling with her husband to paid engagements around the globe.\n\"Mrs. Giuliani made a professional contribution and the mayor recognizes and respects her efforts,\" one aide said. \"He is merely acknowledging both her time commitment and her professional value.\"\nRudy Giuliani's haul for the 126 speeches he gave from January 2006 to March 2007 was $11.4 million, records filed this week show, which means he kicked back something less than 2% to his wife over that period.\nBut with Giuliani running hard for the Republican presidential nomination, he has stopped accepting money for his talks - and Judith is no longer getting a paycheck, aides said.\nThey added, however, that Judith had been getting paid for her time and expertise since shortly before the couple wed in 2003, when Giuliani hit the lecture circuit in earnest.\n\"It's an arrangement that started before they were married,\" said one insider. \"And he pays taxes on it.\"\nThat Judith has long been a member of her husband's traveling entourage is no secret.\nShe can often be seen glued to his side, and the former mayor's standard contract with the Washington Speakers Bureau stated explicitly that Judith \"must be seated directly next to\" her husband if she is present.\nAides said that was so Judith - a former sales executive at Bristol-Myers Squibb and former managing director at Changing Our World Inc., a for-profit consulting firm - could give her husband pointers.\nThere is no suggestion of any illegality in the arrangement, but the idea of a husband paying his wife for services that many political spouses would take for granted is sure to raise some eyebrows.\n\"It just looks odd,\" said Republican strategist Nelson Warfield, a regular Giuliani critic. \"Most spouses view supporting their significant others as part of the package, not part of the compensation package.\"\n\"Some people will joke and ask, 'Is it a straight salary or is there a performance bonus?'\" added Warfield.\nBeyond that, it is likely to feed perceptions that Giuliani's private life - as his own mayoral campaign called it in an internal 1993 memo - contains a certain \"weirdness factor.\"\nThat now includes a first marriage to his second cousin, a very public split with his second wife, and two children ages 17 and 21 who are said to be estranged from him.\n\"Maybe this will help this marriage last, since he's made it a job as well as a position in life,\" said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato. \"Maybe he's found a new approach.\"\ndsaltonstall@nydailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:10:13.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
