(AP) — The knock on both the Packers and Broncos, 6-0 teams with byes this weekend before their Nov. 1 showdown in Denver, is they’ve fattened up on the league’s bottom-feeders. \nThat argument could be made about any of the NFL’s five unbeaten teams, really — and that’s about to change in the next two weeks. \nThe league’s two 5-0 teams, Carolina and New England, have big tests this weekend. The Panthers host the Eagles (3-3), who are tied atop the NFC East after their big win against the Giants, and the Patriots host the New York Jets (4-1). \nThe league’s trio of 6-0 teams all have this weekend off and will take unbeaten records into November. The Bengals visit Pittsburgh (4-2) on Nov. 1 before the Packers and Broncos meet on Sunday Night Football. \n“It’s a huge game,” Broncos cornerback Chris Harris Jr. said. “People keep thinking that our team is just a fluke and we haven’t played anybody. It’s a good game to kind of see where we’re at.” \nAnd show everyone else, added Denver linebacker Von Miller. \n“I still don’t think that we’re getting all the love that we should get,” Miller said, even though Denver’s No. 1-ranked defense has collected 26 sacks and 18 takeaways. “We play Green Bay, Sunday Night Football, we’ll be able to prove our point.” \nThe Fab Five all have skeptics to win over, apparently. \nThe combined records of all five unbeaten teams’ opponents are below .500 and only the Patriots and Broncos have beaten a team with a winning record. \nThe Patriots beat the Steelers in the season opener and two other opponents, the Bills and Colts, are right at .500. Overall, New England’s opponents are a respectable 13-16. \nThat’s by far the best mark by opponents for any of the five teams who have yet to lose. \nThe Broncos beat Minnesota (3-2) but also count three of the league’s 1-5 teams among their victims, and their opponents are 10-24 overall. \nThe Packers’ opponents are 11-24 and none of them have won more than twice. Neither have Carolina’s, whose opponents are a combined 9-20, although you can put their last-minute win at Seattle (2-4) last week in the impressive category no matter the Seahawks’ record. \nCincinnati’s opponents are 11-24, with Buffalo (3-3) the only team not currently under .500. \nSo, yes, they’ve all fattened up a little on the also-rans. But that’s the nature of the NFL. \nBefore losing Dez Bryant and Tony Romo to injury, Dallas sure didn’t have the look of a sub-.500 team heading into Week 7. Neither did the Ravens before losing Terrell Suggs or the Seahawks before misplacing their mojo. \nAnd Denver’s first three games were against the Ravens, Chiefs and Lions, a trio that averaged 10 wins last year and didn’t look like they’d be a combined 3-15 at this point. \nStill, the Broncos are getting the most scrutiny of the unbeaten clubs even though they’re the first team since Indianapolis in 2009 to win four road games in the first six weeks of a season, they own the league’s best defense and the best kicker in Brandon McManus. \nIt’s their offense that has so many so skeptical. Peyton Manning leads the league with 10 interceptions and presided over an injury-riddled unit that went 25 drives without sniffing the end zone before he hit Emmanuel Sanders in stride for a 75-yard touchdown Sunday at Cleveland. \n“Whatever stats people are looking for, we’ve got a great stat and that’s 6-0,” Denver left tackle Ryan Harris said before thinking of another number: “And No. 1 in the division.” \nThe Broncos’ lead in the AFC West is an astonishing 31/2 games, but they understand the skepticism and even the anger from fans and fantasy owners who are kicking themselves for drafting Broncos who are underachieving. \n“That’s just the world we live in,” Miller said. “If we were scoring 45 points on offense and had the No. 1 defense and B-Mac was missing every field goal, they’d be like, ‘OK, we got to get the kicker straight or we’re not going to win.’ ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:32:38.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
