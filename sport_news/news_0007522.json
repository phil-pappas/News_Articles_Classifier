If it sticks, what should I do?\"\nIf Hamilton goes on to win the race he would take a 73 points lead over Rosberg with only 100 points of the season left to play for.\nBack in the pits a visibly disappointed Rosberg told the BBC: \"Straight after the safety car the pedal broke. It was quite dangerous. Definitely not a nice way to end the day.\"\nAsked what this retirement meant for his title ambitions he shrugged: \"I don't know, it's made it more difficult of course.\n\"But I was never going to win a championship like that when normal things break.\n\"But of course I'll come back like I always do to keep pushing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:37:54.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
