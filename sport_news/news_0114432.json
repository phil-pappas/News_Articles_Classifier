Or third. Or fourth. \nBut Davis coach Corbin Talley didn't panic. After all, as he's preached to his team all year, cross country is a team sport. \nWhen the final team totals were tallied and the trophies handed out, the Darts stood with their championship trophy held over their heads, placing runners in spots 6-13 within 18.4 seconds of each other to snap an incredible run of six straight state championships by third-place American Fork. \n\"On this hard course, it's phenomenal. I'm so proud of the way we ran as a team,\" said Talley while fighting back his emotions. \"Our top guy was in sixth place, but we still won by quite a shot against some great teams.\" \nGetting a team of 16-, 17- and 18-year-old boys to buy into a team concept in cross country — a sport normally viewed as individual in nature — wasn't always easy. But the Davis coaching staff preached it every day, and the season-long process culminated Wednesday when Camren Todd finished sixth with a time of 15 minutes, 26.8 seconds and the rest of his team was less than 20 seconds behind him. \n\"It totally motivates us to have our team next to us, pushing us,\" said Todd, one of two juniors in the Dart harriers' top five. \"It's the most motivating thing you can have in a race.\" \nLogan MacKay, who finished eighth overall, admitted it's a bit of a strange concept for racers to focus on the team over an individual performance. \n\"Our coaches tell us over and over again, and it's Colorado State's cross country team's philosophy: cross country is only a team sport,\" said MacKay, who finished in 15:36.5. \"We really believe that. \n\"When our teammates run by us and catch up to us, it is so motivating. That just means that they are in it, too, and we know how fast we are going. We train with each other, and we know where we are with them.\" \nColter Blanchard finished in 15:42.5 for Davis, followed by Colton Rimann in 15:44.8 and Matt Ward in 15:45.2. When Talley saw his third, fourth and fifth runners within the pack that also featured his top two finishing their final sprint, he knew the Darts had just knocked off an incredible run by the Cavemen. \nMeanwhile, Lehi — which finished third in region — surged to a runner-up finish behind Connor Arnell's third-place finish in 15:20.1. Ryan Raff added a seventh-place finish in 15:32.0 for the Pioneers, whose fifth runner came in just 46 seconds later. \nThe junior featured on the Cavemen squad a year ago that capped their sixth-straight, but earning his first individual title was also special. \n\"I got excited. I knew that I could be the state champ, and so I started to pick it up,\" Clinger said through tears of joy. \"I got to 250, 200 and I just went for it. It was a lot different race than I was expecting.\" \nOgden's Alek Parsons' sprint to the finish paid off with an individual state title in 14:58.9, five seconds ahead of second-place William Handley of Timpanogos and third-place Garek Bielaczyc of East. \nThe Timberwolves won the team title, placing three runners in the top 10 to finish with a score of 42. Ogden was second at 65, followed by Olympus at 76. \nNick Hill topped the race in 15:43.5 to claim individual glory, and Canyon View's McKade Steffensen was nearly 10 seconds ahead of the first big pack in 15:50.6 for second place. \nThird-place finisher Jaiden Melendrez led Desert Hills to the team title with a score of 32, followed by Pine View (59) and Stansbury (76). \nNorth Summit's Jace Richins finished in 16:21.9 to win his first state title, and Wasatch Academy's Devin Mesquite was second in 16:35.5. \nMillard took the team title with a score of 87, followed by Emery (105) and North Summit (107). \nMonticello's Tyler Bird won the race in 16:32.2, more than 25 seconds ahead of runner-up Justin Levine of Telos Academy. \nThird-place finisher Jonah Schoppe (17:05.7) and fourth-placer Trenton Stowe (17:26.8) led Panguitch to the team championship with a resounding score of 47, 23 more than second-place Parowan. Monticello was third at 90.
