The coaches were very proud of our young team. That doubles match was our sophomores against their seniors and their doubles team had won their league. “Tulare Union played in Division II in 2014 and dropped down to Division III this year. They were seeded 11 and we were 6, but I thought they would be seeded 4. Their players were very consistent, could lob well and were good at keeping the ball deep. Their top seven players were seniors and their eighth was a junior. “Overall, it was a great season considering our youth. We had no seniors, one junior, six sophomores and one freshman. We went 14-7, which was better than the year before when we were loaded with seniors. These girls are very talented and if they stay together and keep improving, the sky is the limit.” At No. 1 singles, Nikita Sama outplayed Taft’s Kelsey Rushing, 6-2, 6-0. Likewise, Elissia Medrano beat Taft’s Zayn Herrera, 6-4, 6-0. Taft won the next two. Dariana Calderon came from behind to beat Yanet Sanchez, 0-6, 6-3, 13-11. Leighton May was the first one off the court with a trouncing of Breanna Padilla, 6-2, 6-1. “We needed a win at five or six singles, but didn’t get it,” Carnal said. Taft’s Brisa Guizar, who played through a cold, lost to Isabella Boatman, 6-4, 6-2. Taft’s Yuvia Woggn started slow, picked it up but then couldn’t finish strong, Carnal said. Woggn lost to the very steady Anna Gonzalez, 6-3, 4-6, 10-3. Taft won the No. 3 doubles when Herrera and Diana Huizar shut out Prisha Kamboj and Destiny Canchola, 6-0, 6-0. Calderon and May fell to Sama and Sanchez. Then, at No. 2 doubles, Taft’s Rushing and Elizabeth Huizar just got past Medrano and Padilla, 7-5, 7-6 (7-2), to complete the match. While Taft is out of team playoffs, four players will compete in the area (Kern County) individual tournament at Garces High School Friday and Saturday. The tournament is single elimination. Rushing qualified by finishing second in singles in the South Sequoia League tournament, while Calderon finished third. May and Guizar finished fifth in doubles in the SSL tournament. Each of the four leagues in Kern County advance their top six individuals and top six doubles teams to the area tournament.
