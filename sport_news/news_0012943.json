It’s what Epstein, Jed Hoyer and Jason MacLeod do. That’s the president of baseball operations, the general manager and the farm director, and what they do is conquer evil, dreaded rivals in the playoffs.\nA career ago when these giant-killers worked together in Boston, they slew the evil empire known as the Yankees.\nTheir 2004 Red Sox came back from three games-to-none to capture the American League Championship Series, a feat never accomplished in the majors in any postseason.\nEpstein’s Red Sox went on to win the World Series, their first since 1918, but many long-suffering fans of Red Sox Nation would tell you the series against the Yankees was better.\nThat was the blood feud, and there was a new king.\nCubs-Cardinals is a blood feud, and there is a new king because Epstein, from whiz kid to middle-aged genius, has done it again.\nOh, not the World Series. Not yet, anyway, but stand by.\nFor now, though, Cubs fans today undoubtedly feel like Red Sox fans 12 years ago.\nThe Cubs didn’t come from three games down, but they came off losing the opener of their National League Division Series to win three straight to wipe out Cardinals hopes and dreams, sending their 100-win season and best record in baseball into next season.\nThe Cubs also came from 73 victories last year to 97 this year and just ruined their long-time enemy the first time the teams met in the playoffs.\nSuh-weet.\nThe joyous accomplishment glistened with Epstein’s golden touch.\nDrafting and developing rookies the “Cubs Way.’’ Sifting through talent already in-house. Acquiring veterans in savvy trades. Seizing on the availability of one of the game’s best managers.\nIt has worked quicker than anyone might have dreamed without being thought crazy. It worked well enough to depose the Cardinals in a month they feel they own.\nAgain, this is not the goal. There’s no reason to think that also cannot be accomplished this year. But Cubs fans always will have the Cardinals.\n Chicago Cubs Theo Epstein Boston Red Sox St. Louis Cardinals World Series National League American League Championship Series", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561daba2/turbine/ct-cubs-cardinals-rosenbloom-20151013"], "published": "2015-10-14T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:44:01.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
