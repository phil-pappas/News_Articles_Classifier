The defending champions will need to win both and have several other results fall their way to qualify.\nOn the winning goal, Chávez worked his way into Indy’s 18-yard-box and drew defenders before finding Tyrpak, who finished inside the far post past goalkeeper Keith Cardona . In the 19th minute, Chávez broke free on a counter attack and passed to the left wing to Giuseppe Gentile, who sent a low shot inside the far post to put the Scorpions ahead 1-0.\nIndy Eleven (6-9-12, 27 points) got even in the 69th minute after a scramble in the Scorpions’ box. Marvin Ceballos lifted the ball over the San Antonio defense to an unmarked Dylan Mares , who beat goalkeeper Daniel Fernandes to make it 1-1 before Tyrpak put the Scorpions back ahead to stay.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:08:20.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
