Lindner Athletics Center. // SEASON PREVIEWFollowing a season that saw a young and inexperienced team come together to win 23 games and reach the third round of the NCAA tournament – despite losing its coach to a medical condition nine games into the year – Cincinnati returns its top six scorers, more than 80 percent of its productivity and its head coach for a highly anticipated 2015-16 campaign.The latest edition of Bearcats are headlined by a trio of players who earned recognition from American Athletic Conference coaches toward the end of last season. Senior forward Octavius Ellis (Memphis, Tenn./Trinity Valley College [Texas]) received second team all-league honors after proving himself as one of the conference’s top defenders and UC’s best scorer. The Memphis, Tennessee, native ranked as the only player in The American listed in the top four in blocks (third at 2.0), field-goal percentage (third at .557) and rebounds (fourth at 7.2). Sophomore Gary Clark (Clayton, N.C./Clayton High School) impressed the league with his rebounding skills and steady offensive game to earn selection to The American’s All-Rookie Team. UC’s best freshman rebounder since Danny Fortson, Clark pulled in a team-high 246 boards and finished second among league freshmen, averaging 7.2 rebounds. He ended the year fourth on the team with 7.8 points per contest. Junior guard Troy Caupain (Midlothian, Va./Cosby High School) garnered honorable mention all-league acclaim after developing into the team’s top facilitator and one of its most consistent scorers. UC’s leader in assists (3.6 per game), Caupain finished second on the team in points (9.6) – scoring in double figures 17 times. Senior center Coreontae DeBerry (Holland, Mich./Hutchinson CC), sophomore forward Quadri Moore (Linden, N.J./Linden High School) and freshman forward Tre Scott (Darien, Ga./McIntosh County Academy) joins Ellis and Clark in the interior. DeBerry’s inside game blossomed late in the year, contributing a career-best 13 points in 26 minutes against Purdue in the second round of the NCAA tournament. Moore showed his shooting range in flashes last season. Scott displayed his energy and athleticism in preseason workouts with the Bearcats after averaging 21.6 points, 14.1 rebounds and 3.7 blocks as a senior last year at McIntosh County Academy in Darien, Georgia. Other post players include junior walk-on forward Zack Tobler and junior forward Kyle Washington, who averaged 6.8 points and 4.1 rebounds at NC State a year ago. Washington will sit out UC’s 2015-16 campaign due to NCAA transfer rules. Senior Farad Cobb (West Palm Beach, Fla./Northwest Fla. St. College), junior Kevin Johnson (Cincinnati, Ohio/Summit Country Day) and freshman Justin Jenifer (Baltimore, Md./Milford Mills Academy) join Caupain in the backcourt. Cobb was a catalyst during UC’s run to the postseason a year ago, averaging a team-best 12.2 points while shooting 44.7 percent from field in March. Johnson showed himself as a threat from the outside, dropping in 43 three-pointers – second-most on the team behind Cobb (53). A speedy, gifted ball handler with great creativity as a passer, Jenifer averaged 17.3 points and 7.0 assists as a senior at Milford Mills Academy in Baltimore, Maryland, last year. Senior forward Shaq Thomas (Paterson, N.J./NIA Prep) and freshman swingman Jacob Evans III (Baton Rouge, La./St. Michael the Archangel) will roam the wing for the Bearcats this season. The athletically gifted Thomas poured in a career-high 18 points to rally the Bearcats past Houston and set the stage for their five-game win streak to end the regular season. A talented shooter and determined scorer, Evans averaged 24.9 points and 9.0 rebounds as a senior last year at St. Michael the Archangel in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. // BEARCATS RETURNING TOP SIX SCORERSCincinnati returns a large portion of its productivity from the 2015-16 campaign.Category: Returning/Lost (Percent Returning)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:49:29.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
