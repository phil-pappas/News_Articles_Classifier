The University of Louisville’s embattled basketball coach may be “disheartened” by allegations of sexually charged recruiting practices within his program, but he is not defeated and he’s sure not surrendering.\n“I will not resign and let you down,” Pitino said in a blog post on Thursday. “Someday I will walk away in celebration of many memorable years but that time is not now.”\nNo surprise there.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nRick Pitino should go, some faculty say\nWith 11 seasons left on a contract worth nearly $51 million, Pitino has a powerful financial incentive to keep fighting. No one walks away leaving that much money on the table; certainly no one as smart or as shrewd as Rick Pitino. When Denny Crum resigned under pressure in 2001, his gold-plated U of L parachute included $7 million payable over 15 years.\nIf you want a coach to go gently into that good night, you’re probably going to have to pay him a significant sum to make it appear harmonious.\nYet at this point in a prosperous career, Pitino’s motivation goes far beyond money. He is a Hall of Fame coach whose considerable achievements and lasting legacy have been tainted by allegations of a subordinate’s nefarious conduct. Though no evidence has surfaced that would tie Pitino directly to the hiring of hookers at Billy Minardi Hall, and though there’s no proof of his willful ignorance of those claims, his position places him at the center of the scandal and revised NCAA rules hold him accountable for infractions committed by his staff.\nConsequently, Pitino is fighting for his reputation, for the opportunity to shape the narrative as the investigation proceeds and for the chance to script a more appealing ending to his career. And he is fighting vigorously even as his superiors have tried to maintain a tight-lipped public posture.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nPitino: 'I will not resign and let you down'\nIn pleading with former director of basketball operations Andre McGee to come forward, and painting him as the only one who knows the truth, Pitino creates the impression of a rogue assistant acting independently and of a head coach pursuing a containment strategy. Yet the dynamic Katina Powell describes in “Breaking Cardinal Rules,” also refers to the involvement of a “Coach Mike” and to financial transactions with other unnamed intermediaries. If McGee arranged for Powell to provide sexual services in 2014 for U of L recruit Anthony Blakeney, he did so after taking another job at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and, presumably, at the behest of someone else on the basketball staff.\nThat allegation remains unproven, but it is enormously problematic. It suggests an ongoing conspiracy and, in NCAA parlance, a glaring \"lack of institutional control.\"\nSince McGee’s coaching career is likely ruined as a result of this scandal, perhaps he can be persuaded to take the fall for his alma mater. Whether he could convince investigators that he acted alone and without financial assistance might take more doing.\nFinancially, at least, Pitino is protected so long as the scandal can be contained at levels beneath him. His employment contract provides for the possibility of termination for just cause (and limited cost) in the event of major violations of university, conference or NCAA rules and bylaw. Still, the document specifically describes an “understanding” that Pitino “shall not be responsible for misconduct of third parties, assistants, or other representatives of the athletic interest” of the university,” unless Pitino “was aware of such misconduct and failed to promptly report it” or “failed to exercise diligent, careful supervision” of his staff.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nSullivan | Readers divided on Pitino's fate\nShould the administration decide to pursue an exit strategy with its head basketball coach, the appearance that Andre McGee was inadequately supervised might create some leverage for the university. As of Thursday afternoon, however, Board of Trustees chairman Larry Benz indicated that such speculation was premature.\n“I fully support our athletic director's position on the topic,” Benz said via email. “As painful as it is, we are beholden to the rigor and the process that is outlined by the NCAA and we will cooperate and oblige fully the requirements of the investigation. Because of this, there has been no deliberation by the board (regarding Pitino’s future).”\nThat didn't prevent Bookmaker Sportsbook from setting a line on Pitino's employment. As of Thursday afternoon, bettors had to wager $200 to win $100 that Pitino will still be Louisville's coach as of the Nov. 13 season-opener against Samford.\nFor now, at least, the odds are in his favor.\nTim Sullivan can be reached at (502) 582-4650, tsullivan@courier-journal.com or @TimSullivan714 on Twitter.\nGet the CJ’s free UofL CardsHQ newsletter", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6fc15e13bf00baa856855b777dfb5c3de5f3dc85/c=208-0-3249-3041/local/-/media/2015/10/22/Louisville/Louisville/635811132448367453-GettyImages-480057141.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/823e1ca389d1f9de8d7ee279ca120efe1dac0461/c=0-203-1764-1200&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/10/09/Louisville/Louisville/635800298950097466-USATSI-8245872.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:41:33.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
