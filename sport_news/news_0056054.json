Substitute Gadze headed home a Florent Malouda cross as he timed his jump to perfection heading home from close range, much to the dismay of the home fans and team's owner Sachin Tendulkar, who graced the stands. Dynamos now have 9 points from four games after their third win and straightaway jumped to the second spot in the league table behind Pune City FC. ABU DHABI\nCook proud as England nearly secure shock win England captain Alastair Cook (in pic) hailed his team's performance in drawing the first Test with Pakistan after the tourists recovered from conceding more than 500 first innings runs to be within 25 of an improbable victory. England were 74/4 when bad light ended play on the final day of the opening match in a three-Test series. Such a near-miss was extraordinary as Pakistan collapsed from 102-3 at tea to 173 all out 21 overs later. Cook said his team's resurgence made him just as proud as any of his Test wins as England captain. \"The fact that you concede 520 and then you're the side who are pretty much going to win the game, an inexperienced side too,\" said Cook.

Scotland had been on the verge of a stunning upset with 79 minutes on the clock after an epic quarterfinal but referee Craig Joubert awarded Australia a penalty for offside, despite the ball appearing to come off a Wallaby shirt. Flyhalf Foley kept his composure to split the posts and ensure the World Cup would have four southern hemisphere semifinalists for the first time. New Zealand and South Africa will meet in the other semifinal, both at Twickenham next weekend.— Agencies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:03:51.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
