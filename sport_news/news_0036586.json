Photo: AP For those who are convinced this Klinsmann experiment has timed out and change must be made, here’s the problem: He’s signed through 2018, which means through the next World Cup.\nAnd Klinsmann has too much power. When he signed a four-year extension after the last World Cup, Klinsmann also became the Technical Director for US Soccer, which has far-reaching implications with regard to the growth of the sport at the highest level in America.\nNot only is the national team struggling, but the US is in danger of not qualifying for the 2016 Olympic Games, which would be inexcusable.\nHere’s a recent sample of the state of US Soccer under Klinsmann’s watch:\n• Last Tuesday, the U-20 national team lost 8-1 to Germany in Klinsmann’s hometown of Stuttgart.\n• On Saturday afternoon, the U-23 national team, coached by Austrian Andi Herzog and German assistant Matthias Hamann (both hand-picked by Klinsmann), was dominated by Honduras 2-0 in its effort to qualify for the Olympics.\n• Later Saturday, Klinsmann’s national team was manhandled by Mexico.\nJurgen Klinsmann claims Fabian Johnson (right) faked an injury to get out of the game.

More importantly, a week indicative of how US soccer is running in place with Klinsmann in charge — in no better a place than it was under the watch of his predecessors, Bob Bradley and Bruce Arena.\nBefore the loss to Mexico, Klinsmann said “winning this CONCACAF Cup is really crucial.”\nThe loss to Mexico came after the US managed a pedestrian fourth-place finish on home soil at the Gold Cup, a tournament Klinsmann had called “very, very important to us’’ before his team was outshot, 75-25, by Honduras, Panama and Haiti.\nThe roster Klinsmann is bringing to Tuesday night’s friendly against Costa Rica was radically altered following the loss to Mexico, with eight players released from team duties and five others called up.\nOne of eight players released was right back Fabian Johnson, who Klinsmann claimed faked an injury in overtime of the Mexico match and asked to be subbed off the field.\n“I had a very severe word with Fabian Johnson, and I sent him home today,” Klinsmann said Monday. “He can rethink his approach about his team.’’\nThere are many who believe Klinsmann needs to rethink his approach to building US Soccer.\n“Everybody can express his opinion, and not everyone likes you,’’ Klinsmann said before Tuesday’s match. “That’s totally fine. I’m not here to be liked. I’m trying to do a good job, and I’m privileged to have that role and represent the US soccer program. I do my best, to my capabilities, and leave the judgment out there for you guys and for people who want to express themselves.”\n  costa rica soccer ,  jurgen klinsmann ,  soccer ,  us soccer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:44:16.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
