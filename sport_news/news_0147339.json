Ridiculous.\nToo old? No chance.\nAt age 40, Ottawa RedBlacks quarterback Henry Burris still has some serious freaking game.\nAll of Burris' critics can put this in their pipe and smoke it. The RedBlacks shredded both the Montreal Alouettes and the CFL record book on Thursday night. Burris completed 45-of-53 passes for 504 yards as the RedBlacks won 39-17. The 45 completions broke a single-game, regular-season CFL record of 44 set by Montreal's Anthony Calvillo Oct. 4, 2008 vs. Hamilton. Burris set the record early in the fourth quarter on a pass to Patrick Lavoie.\nBurris threw for touchdowns and also ran into the end zone for two touchdowns of his own. Chris Milo booted three field goals and the RedBlacks also got a safety.\n“The guy's an ageless wonder – the work ethic he has and the grind he puts in day in and day out to get better – it truly is special,” said RedBlacks receiver Chris Williams, who had nine catches for 98 yards and a touchdown.\n“People know how I am, I'm not a big record guy, I'm all about getting victories,” said Burris. “If that's what happens, getting a record, then so be it. But for me, it's a tribute to the offensive line, it starts there first, then the playmakers outside gave me time to read the coverage and get the ball to them.”\nIt was a shame more people didn't see it. The attendance of 21,607 on a chilly night fell about 3,000 short of a sellout. So far for Tuesday night, against the Argos, the RedBlacks have sold just 11,000. Time to jump on that bandwagon, fans.\nPencil it in and keep an eraser close by, but it sure looks like the RedBlacks are going to the playoffs.\nThat “P” word became a lot more real Thursday. With eight wins and still five games to play, the RedBlacks moved into a first place tie with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats (who have a game in hand) in the CFL East, one game ahead of the Toronto Argos (who also have a game in hand). The Alouettes are now three games behind the RedBlacks, who also have the tiebreaker, having swept Montreal in their season series. In a crossover scenario, both B.C. and Winnipeg have four wins.\nIt wasn't just The Burris Show. The receivers came up big. Brad Sinopoli had seven catches for 107 yards, Maurice Price nine catches for 104 yards. Greg Ellingson had five catches for 83 yards. It was also a rock-solid effort from the defence, which stifled the Als much of the night.\nThe RedBlacks jumped into a 23-3 halftime lead.\nAfter stopping the Alouettes' opening drive, the RedBlacks marched downfield. Twice, the RedBlacks gambled on third-and-one and Burris kept the ball to get the yard. Burris jumped over the pile to score the touchdown.\nAfter a Boris Bede field goal, the RedBlacks made it 14-3 on an 18-yard TD catch by Williams.\nBurris continued to pick apart the Alouettes defence, but the RedBlacks decided not to gamble on third-and-one deep in Montreal territory and settled for a 17-yard field goal by Milo.\nAfter a Moton Hopkins sack led to the RedBlacks getting the ball back on the Montreal 50-yard line, Milo booted a 34-yard field goal. With 0.6 seconds on the clock, Milo added a 16-yard field goal.\nOttawa made it 30-3 with Sinopoli fighting his way for the score from eight yards out.\nOttawa made it 37-3 as Burris once again snuck into the end zone. Ottawa got a safety and the Als scored a couple of late touchdowns.\nTwitter: @timcbaines\nBurris sets passing record in Ottawa RedBlacks romp\nSTORY PRESENTED BY http://realsports.ca/BarandGrill/ottawa/ Sponsored By Tim Baines , Ottawa Sun First posted: Thursday, October 01, 2015 10:43 PM EDT | Updated: Thursday, October 01, 2015 11:32 PM EDT\nWashed up?
