Blaze has gluten-free options and calorie counts on all its signature pizzas, salads, drinks and s’more pie dessert.\nJim Mizes, chief operating officer of Pasadena-based Blaze Pizza, said in a release that the company “couldn’t ask for a better place to begin than the food-forward city of Toronto.”\nThe “pizzasmiths” at the counter add various choices of sauce, cheeses, meat and veggies to the dough made on site. Once you make your way to the end of the line, the thin-crust pizza is fast-fired in an open-hearth oven that fits a dozen 12-inch pizzas at a time at extreme temperatures — which is how they live up to their pledge of cooking your pie in 180 seconds.\nThree tourists visiting from Brittany, France, gave their cheesy concoction the thumbs-up, as did the Pieology spies, whose Orange County-based company will introduce Toronto and Calgary to their similar gourmet pizza franchise in March as their first locations outside the U.S.\nWosik said there’s room for competition, since “Canada is about three to five years behind the U.S.” on the so-called “fast casual” food concept.\n“I like how they do everything right in front of you, plus it’s healthy,” said second-year Ryerson business student Denecious Ansalem, 19.\nThere’s no word yet on whether James will come by the Toronto location to push the pies, but manager Dorich said he’s optimistic, since Toronto will host the NBA all-star game next February.\nMore on thestar.com\n‘It’s like turning all the locks clear’\nHuge haul of gold bars still missing in bank-fraud case", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:56:59.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
