Brees' 400th TD pass lifts Saints over Cowboys, 26-20 in OT 1  /  6 Back to Gallery NEW ORLEANS (AP) — Drew Brees hit C.J. Spiller with a short pass that the running back turned into an 80-yard touchdown — the 400th of the Saints quarterback's career — on the second play of overtime, and New Orleans won for the first time this season, 26-20 over the injury-decimated Cowboys on Monday night.\nBrees, who missed New Orleans' previous game because of a bruised rotator cuff in his right (throwing) shoulder, completed 33 of 41 throws for 359 yards and two TDs in his return.\nMark Ingram gained 126 yards from scrimmage on a combination of runs and short passes, and Khiry Robinson had a 1-yard touchdown run for New Orleans (1-3).\nJoseph Randle scored the lone TD for Dallas (2-2) on a 1-yard run in the first half. The winning score enlivened a Superdome crowd stunned by Saints kicker Zach Hocker 's 30-yard miss in the final seconds of regulation.\n___\nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \n___\nThis story has been corrected to reflect Brees' final completion in stats total.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:23:51.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
