By ROB OESTERLE - roesterle@shawmedia.com \nCOAL CITY – A look around the state at the football scores from this weekend’s action features many games in which at least one team scored 30 points or more. Some even saw both teams break 40. Related Links Coal City defense stands tall in victory \nOffense seems to have taken center stage, with the defenses lagging behind. \nThat was not the case Friday in Coal City, as the Coalers and Lisle staged an old-fashioned defensive struggle. Unfortunately for Coal City, it was the Lisle defense that prevailed with a 7-3 victory, leaving Coal City with a 4-4 record, needing a win Friday at Seneca to move to 5-4 and becoming eligible for the playoffs and then hoping that they have enough playoff points to make the field. \nIt’s certainly not the ideal situation for his team to be in, but Coal City coach Lenny Onsen is glad his team still has a shot. \n“Actually, I am one of those guys that feels like a 5-4 team shouldn’t make the playoffs,” he said. “But, we still have a shot to do it, so we still have some work to do, I can’t fault our defense. They only gave up one score. Our offense really struggled to get anything going, though. \n“Give Lisle’s defense credit. They aren’t real big, but they are very quick to the ball and they closed any holes real fast.” \nThey did, indeed, as Coal City’s running game – which has been the Coalers’ offensive strength this season – was held to 40 yards on 29 attempts. Joe Starkey led the way with 54 yards on 14 attempts, but a couple of sacks by the Lisle defense brought the team total down. The Coalers did have 114 passing yards, but 61 of those came on a trick play late in the game when receiver Christian Johnson, the backup quarterback, took a lateral and threw deep to Brad Littleton. \nCoal City’s defense, meanwhile, performed admirably and did what it could to keep Lisle off the board. The Coalers blocked two field goals – one each by Mike Chiarappa and Alec Leasure – and got fumble recoveries from Mike Pampuch and Junior Arias. \nAnd, while Coal City’s defense was busy working hard to keep Lisle off the board, the Lions hurt themselves with some key penalties. In the first quarter, Lisle’s Mark McGrath made a 30-yard field goal, but there was an illegal procedure penalty that took the points off the board and forced another try from 5–yards back. That’s the kick that Chiarappa blocked. In the second quarter, Lisle forced Coal City to punt from deep in its own territory. The snap was high and Littleton was able to keep it from going over his head and out of the end zone for a safety. He managed to get a kick away, but it was short and gave Lisle good field position. But, Lisle was called for roughing the kicker and that gave Coal City a first down and 15 more yards. \n“Our defense was pretty good, but we still had some breakdowns,” Onsen said. “We had a few times when we needed a stop earlier so we could give the offense the ball in better position, but we gave up a first down. In a game like this, field position was a big thing, and Lisle definitely won that battle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:11:11.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
