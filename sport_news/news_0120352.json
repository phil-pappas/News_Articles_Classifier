(AP) â€” Help wanted: Healthy football players with a valid passport.\nThat's the all-points-bulletin Bills general manager Doug Whaley issued after Buffalo scrambled to scour what free agents might be available before flying to London immediately following a 34-21 loss to the Cincinnati on Sunday.\n\"Logistically, it's very tough,\" Whaley told The Associated Press . \"First of all, you've got to make sure they have a passport. So it's going to put us in a bind. We're going to go straight to work on that right now.\"\nBanged-up before the game began, the Bills (3-3) lost several more starters to injuries a week before the Bills play Jacksonville at Wembley Stadium.\nStarting receiver Sammy Watkins did not return after twisting his left ankle while making a 22-yard touchdown catch. Starting defensive tackle Kyle Williams was carted off after hurting his left knee in the final minutes. Backup receiver Marquise Goodwin did not return after hurting his ribs on a kickoff return. And starting right tackle Seantrel Henderson was being examined for a possible concussion.\nAnd that doesn't include Buffalo being forced to start backup quarterback EJ Manuel in place of Tyrod Taylor , who was sidelined by a left knee injury.\nCoach Rex Ryan didn't have an immediate update on the status of his injured players.\nWhat's troubling, Ryan acknowledged, is how the rash of injuries is affecting the team's play and morale.\n\"You have a vision of what this team can be when we're healthy. And it's just frustrating because you don't have your parts,\" Ryan said. \"It's just amazing.\"\nThe Bills hung tight until the start of the second half, when the Bengals (6-0) scored 17 points on their first three drives to open a 34-14 lead.\nBuffalo's defense held star receiver A.J. Green in check by limiting him to four catches for 36 yards.\nBut they couldn't contain everyone as quarterback Andy Dalton threw touchdown passes to Marvin Jones , Tyler Eifert and Jeremy Hill , and Giovani Bernard scored on a 17-yard run.\n\"You take away this guy, you take away that guy,\" Ryan said. \"Well, this other dude beats you.\"\nJones did the most damage with a career-best nine catches for 95 yards, and capped the opening third-quarter drive with a 10-yard catch.\nManuel was inconsistent in making his first start in a little more than a year. He finished 28 of 42 for 263 yards with a touchdown and interception. He also scored on a 2-yard run on Buffalo's opening drive.\nThe Bills' offense, however, dried up after Manuel scored. Buffalo combined for 0 yards and no first downs on its following four possessions.\nRunning back LeSean McCoy returned after missing two games with a left hamstring injury. He had 90 yards rushing and scored on a 4-yard run in the fourth quarter.\nBuffalo has lost three straight at home for the first time since 2011.\n___\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:18:47.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
