On Thursday, police said “there is growing evidence to indicate it was a criminal incident”, specifically the fact that the driver was in a vehicle with stolen plates and using a fake Israeli ID card.\nPolice are currently investigating the strong possibility that he may have stolen the car and attempted to run the checkpoint in order to evade arrest.\nThe incident at a-Zaim came shortly after a stabbing attack on Jabotinsky Street in Petah Tikva , one of the busiest thoroughfares in central Israel that left one Israeli badly wounded.\nPolice said Thursday that greater tragedy was averted however, when the knife wielded by the Palestinian attacker broke in his hand just as he attacked his victim, preventing him from stabbing anyone else.\nSharon subdistrict police said that the blade wielded by 25-year-old Tamer Yunes Ahmed Varidat snapped off the handle of the knife immediately after he plunged it into a 25-year-old Israeli man just after he got off a bus on Jabotinsky Street, a major thoroughfare in the central Israel city.\nIn surveillance camera footage of the attack, the terrorist can then be seen pacing along the sidewalk, seemingly looking for another victim even as he is suddenly unarmed. Within moments he was set upon by bystanders, who held him until police arrived.\nThe incident was one of several attacks across Israel on Wednesday that left wounded almost a dozen Israelis.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:39:46.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
