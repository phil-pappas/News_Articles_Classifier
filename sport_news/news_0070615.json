(AP) - Dwayne Harris sped 100 yards with a kickoff return against his former Dallas teammates seconds after the Cowboys had tied Sunday's game, and the New York Giants moved atop the NFC East with a 27-20 victory. \nHarris spent four seasons in Dallas without running back a kickoff for a score. But he tied a Giants record set in 1994 by romping untouched to the end zone. \nNew York (4-3) snapped a five-game slide against Dallas (2-4) thanks to big plays by its defense and special teams. Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie had two interceptions, returning one 58 yards for a touchdown. \nThe Cowboys, losers of four in a row without injured offensive stars Tony Romo and Dez Bryant, got a big game from Darren McFadden. Starting running back Joseph Randle left early with a strained back, and McFadden rushed for 152 yards and a TD. \nMLS-EARTHQUAKES-FC DALLAS \nUlloa lifts FC Dallas past San Jose Earthquakes, 2-1 \nFRISCO, Texas (AP) - Victor Ulloa slipped a shot underneath diving San Jose goalkeeper David Bingham in the 79th minute to give FC Dallas a 2-1 victory Sunday that eliminated the Earthquakes from the MLS Cup playoffs. \nFC Dallas (18-10-6) came into the match tied with the New York Red Bulls for the Supporter's Shield, which goes to the Major League Soccer team with the best record, but the Red Bulls, who had a better goal differential, claimed the title on the strength of their 2-1 win over the Chicago Fire. \nDallas boasted a 13-2-2 record at Toyota Stadium, but needed a second-half comeback to claim the final home victory. \nQuincy Amarikwa scored in the 13th minute to give San Jose a 1-0 lead. Mauro Diaz scored the equalizer in the 38th minute. \nSan Jose (13-13-8) played a man down after Matias Perez Garcia was sent off for violent conduct in the 67th minute. \nMLS-DYNAMO-WHITECAPS \nWhitecaps beat Dynamo 3-0, finish second in West \nVANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) - Kekuta Manneh and Kendall Waston scored in the second half and the Vancouver Whitecaps beat the Houston Dynamo 3-0 on Sunday to finish second in the Western Conference. \nVancouver (16-13-5) earned a first-round bye in the playoffs with the second-place finish. \nManneh took a pass from Gershon Koffie at the top of the penalty area and fired a low strike from 25 yards that went inside the post past goalkeeper Joe Willis in the 59th minute. Waston headed in a corner kick in the 72nd minute, and Robert Earnshaw added another in stoppage time on header of his own. \nHouston finished 11-14-9. \nABILENE CHRISTIAN-INCARNATE WORD \nSessions leads Incarnate Word past Abilene Christian 25-20 \nSAN ANTONIO (AP) - Junior Sessions ran for two touchdowns and 174 yards to lead Incarnate Word to a 25-20 victory over Abilene Christian on Sunday. \nTrent Brittain threw for 368 yards and a touchdown for Incarnate Word (4-3, 3-2 Southland Conference). Kody Edwards had seven catches for 128 yards. \nBrittain connected with Jordan Hicks on a 4-yard touchdown pass to put the Cardinals up 16-13 late in the third quarter. Dallas Sealey threw a 75-yard scoring strike to Carl Whitley after the ensuing kickoff to help Abilene Christian (2-5, 2-4) regain the lead. \nCody Seidel kicked a 22-yard field goal to open the fourth quarter. Sessions scored on a 15-yard run with 48 seconds remaining. \nSealy drove the Wildcats to the Cardinals 48 with eight seconds left before Robert Johnson intercepted his next pass to end it. \nThe game was scheduled for Saturday, but was postponed due to heavy rains. \nCOWBOYS-HARDY TIRADE \nGreg Hardy scolds Cowboys kick coverage team \nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) - Dallas defensive end Greg Hardy broke into the special teams huddle to berate his teammates after they gave up a decisive 100-yard kickoff return by New York's Dwayne Harris. \nAfter Harris sped the length of the field for the winning points in the Giants' 27-20 victory, Hardy broke into the subsequent special teams huddle before New York kicked off with 7:01 remaining Sunday. \nSafety Danny McCray, a member of the unit, said the passionate Hardy even \"pushed me a little bit.\" \nCowboys coach Jason Garrett said the incident was not an issue. \nHardy is in his first season with Dallas and missed the first four games while suspended under the NFL's personal conduct policy while with Carolina. Hardy played only one game for the Panthers in 2014 and spent the rest of the year on the commissioner's exempt list with full pay. He signed with the Cowboys as a free agent earlier this year. \nT25-BAYLOR-RUSSELL INJURY \nNo. 2 Baylor facing potential huge loss with QB Russell hurt \nWACO, Texas (AP) - Playoff hopeful Baylor is facing a potentially huge loss after staying undefeated, with quarterback Seth Russell set to see a specialist for a fractured bone in his neck. \nThe extent of Russell's injury won't be known until after that visit early this week, but the second-ranked Bears (7-0) will almost certainly be without the top-rated FBS passer for at least some time when headed into their toughest stretch of the season. \nAfter Russell got hurt in the Bears' win over Iowa State on Saturday, coach Art Briles said he was concerned \"about his health and then football.\" \nBriles later told ESPN's Brett McMurphy that Russell \"would probably be out awhile.\" \nF1-US GRAND PRIX \nHamilton wins US Grand Prix and F1 season championship \nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Lewis Hamilton seized on a late mistake by Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg to win the United States Grand Prix and secure his third Formula One season championship. \nHamilton overtook Rosberg with eight laps to go Sunday when Rosberg locked his tires and helplessly watched his teammate zoom past. \nHamilton had to beat Rosberg and outscore Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel by nine points to wrap up his second consecutive championship with Mercedes. He also won with McLaren in 2008. \nThe win also gives Hamilton his 21st victory over two seasons and 10th this year. He is the first Formula One driver to win 10 or more races in consecutive seasons. \nVettel, who could have pushed the title chase to next week in Mexico City, finished third after starting 13th. \nF1-US GRAND PRIX-QUALIFYING \nRosberg on pole, Hamilton No. 2 in US Grand Prix qualifying \nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Lewis Hamilton will chase the Formula One world championship from the No. 2 position at the United States Grand Prix after Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg grabbed pole in a rain-shortened qualifying session. \nHeavy rains have pounded the Circuit of the Americas for three days. Race officials allowed only two qualifying rounds Sunday as conditions worsened in a session that had been delayed from Saturday. \nHamilton can clinch his second consecutive world championship and third overall if he outscores Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel by nine points and Rosberg by two. Rosberg started on the pole here last year before Hamilton won. \nFormula One was forced to use its first Sunday qualifying since 2013 and fourth overall since 2004. Rain was still falling when the drivers took the track. \nHamilton called the wet conditions \"quite fun.\" Race officials expect better conditions as rain chances are forecast to decrease Sunday afternoon.
