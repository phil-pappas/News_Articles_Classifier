It allowed a harmless touchdown with 30 seconds to go in the game.\n“We played our game,” Wolves head coach Mike Lightfoot said. “The defense was on every snap today and they just did everything we asked them to do.”\nAfter Grand Street went into the locker room with a 16-6 lead, both teams came out with two straight three-and-outs to start the second half and played a scoreless third quarter.\nBut then Harris-Legree hooked up with senior wide receiver Ahmed Bah on a 52-yard touchdown to put the Wolves ahead 24-6 with 11:32 left in the fourth quarter.\nAfter Erasmus quarterback Aaron Grant threw his second interception of the game, Harris-Legree threw a 55-yard touchdown to Taysir Mack to extend the Wolves’ lead to 24 — 32-6 — with 10:15 left in the game.\n“I trust my guys,” said Harris-Legree. “I’m nothing without my offense line and they give me the protection I need to make plays.”\nHarris-Legree had been looking forward to this game against one of the league’s better teams over the last few seasons.\n“It meant a lot to him (Harris-Legree),” Lightfoot said. “He had never beaten this team before and for him to do it in this fashion shows how far he has come.”\nThe Wolves’ dominated the fourth quarter, which showed just how seriously they should be taken this season, according to their quarterback.\n“It all starts in practice,” Harris-Legree said. “We need have another game this week and we have get back at it in practice.”\nAfter playing winless Jefferson on the road next weekend, the Wolves end their regular season against New Utrecht.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:10:50.810+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
