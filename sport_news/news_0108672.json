However, few people who have the disease meet exercise recommendations. \n50-year-old Mona Vander Zee is in great shape. \n\"I love to be active,\" Vander Zee said. \nThe Harrisburg woman works out most days of the week but admits that wasn't always the case. \n\"With three kids and an acreage, I was having trouble fitting it into my daily life,\" Vander Zee said. \nIt was actually a breast cancer diagnosis in July 2014 that got Vander Zee back to the gym. \n\"I want to be here for my children. I had a daughter who was seven years old when I was diagnosed. She's nine now. The thought of me not being there for her and the two older kids I have was just heart wrenching,\" Vander Zee said. \nHowever, hitting the gym while or after battling cancer isn't always easy. \n\"I noticed I was having some difficulty because I had had a mastectomy, and the muscles were really tight,\" Vander Zee said. \nCertified Cancer Exercise Specialist Kim Donelan says you should take it slow when you first start working out after or during a cancer battle. \n\"Really focusing on core strength and upper back strength, depending on the type of cancer, is huge,\" Donelan said. \nDonelan recommends row exercises, planks and yoga. \nIf you suffer from pain following a cancer battle, it's also not a bad idea to head to the pool. \n\"Water pressure really helps lymphatic fluid flow efficiently. A lot of times with those certain treatments that may have happened, the lymphatic system is a little impaired,\" Donelan said. \nSimple stretches are also key. Put your hands on both sides of the door frame, and lean slightly in. \n\"I don't have pain like I did because of the exercises I'm doing,\" Vander Zee said. \nExercises that Vander Zee hopes will help her fight off cancer in the future. \n\"I'm feeling really good. I've had a great year with my kids, and I'm fully recovered,\" Vander Zee said. \nYou should talk to your doctor before starting an exercise program. \nThere are also local programs geared towards those who have or are battling cancer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:15:48.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
