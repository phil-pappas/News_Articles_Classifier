The incident ended with guns in the Wizards locker room and Arenas being charged with felony gun possession. \nLast week, Arenas disputed Butler's version of events on Instagram, and on Monday morning, he followed up with further details in which he accused Butler of hiding Crittenton's weapon and misleading the Wizards. Like last week's post, Monday's was deleted, but Deadspin captured Arenas' comments : PART 2…the locker room….the reason im pointing out key facts is….my name is being put in a light by someone who actually wasnt there…..in carons book he said Crit pulled out a gun ,cocked and loaded at me okay im so [expletive] confused here @dsteve92 stop me if im lying….but wasnt CB the person who hiding crit gun and said it was a #IPOD?? i took a #FELONY becuz You told them #crit didnt have anything and i pointed the gun at him..thats why the world thinks im the one who pulled the Gun on my teammate and thats the story the team thought was correct…becuz u convinced the team he didnt have it….if ur story is correct in ur book #Toughjuice and he had a loaded gun pointed at me…HOW THE [expletive] DID i get a felony charge and 30 days in a halfway house and all he got was a slap on the wrist and a misdemeanor charge and i didnt touch one gun or was near any guns #BISWHAT..it took the DA 1 month to find his gun becuz u had it..i respected u as a teammate but this was foul knowing what u did….i kept my mouth close and u dry snitch the wrong story like u were a role model and some super teammate….ur a standup guy dont get me wrong,what u did for crit was what u should have done but what u did too me wasnt…so pls dont act like u liked us one bit bra….me,tawn,blatche,nick,dsteve,javale bwood You need our numbers???the reason im coming at u becuz we had a team meeting and like eddie once said too u(were just gonna call it how it is,a spade is a spade) good luck with the book tour but str8 [expletive] you did in this book…[expletive] can i atleast get a signed copy lma for real since i have too live ur [expletive] again hahahaha i had the most too LOSE and still sat there with my mouth closed and laughed with u….MY crime was Bring unloaded guns to a locker room…I paid that price…the famous lines of CB after i got suspended too the team (theres a new sheriff in town) haha.. for the record on EVERY road trip #crit #javale came to my room and ordered room service so they didnt have to spend their own money….(caron voice..crit didnt like his ways) hahahahaha the [expletive] liked my food lmaooo #Yi-yow \nArenas was suspended for most of the 2009-10 season for his involvement in the altercation.
