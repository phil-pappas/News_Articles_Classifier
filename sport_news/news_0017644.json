(Photo: David Stephenson/AP) \nLEXINGTON, Kentucky. — Will Muschamp said nearly a month ago that he would always relish a chance to win a game with his defense. \nAfter watching his players give up nearly 500 yards of offense, Auburn’s defensive coordinator got his wish Thursday night. \n“I wanted to be on the field to redeem ourselves because we didn’t play well at all for three quarters,” Auburn linebacker Justin Garret t said. “It was huge for the coaches to have enough confidence to hand the game to us.” \nAuburn used the late defensive stop to escape hyped atmosphere in Kentucky with thrilling 30-27 victory. The result was Auburn’s first Southeastern Conference win in its last six attempts in front of a raucous crowd experiencing Kentucky’s first Thursday night game in the history of Commonwealth Stadium. In a tone that obviously full of relief, Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn referred to the big-picture impact of the win as “a common sense deal” to the Tigers 2015 season. \n“We needed this win,” Malzahn said. “We’re 2-0 in October so we’re going in the right direction.” \nAfter punting on a fourth-and-one situation near midfield, Auburn got its third sack game of the night with a four-man rush on Kentucky quarterback Patrick Towles to seal the win. Malzahn said he consulted with Muschamp before deciding to hand the ball back to Kentucky and said it “was huge” to see a defensive stand ends the Wildcats comeback effort. \n“I talk to Will about every big decision and just felt like that was the thing to do and our defense came up big,” Malzahn said. “That’s a really good sign for them.” \nTowles, who has been Kentucky enigmatic quarterback in his junior season, finished with a season-high 359 yards but was responsible for the game’s only turnover. \nAuburn (4-2, 1-2 in SEC) finally found the offensive rhythm they spent the entire bye week searching for as redshirt freshman Sean White led the Tigers to back-to-back touchdowns on their first two drives. White, who won the bye week starting competition with Jeremy Johnson at the quarterback position, was asked to put the ball in the air frequently against a struggling Kentucky defense. White was 12 of 18 for 186 yards in a first half that saw Auburn take a 23-10 halftime lead into the locker room. \nThe Tigers, who were last in the nation in plays of 20-yards or more, showcased a big-play element to its attack thanks to the emergence of Ricardo Louis . \nWithout the services of dismissed receiver D’haquille Williams, Auburn knew they’d need a replacement threat on the perimeter and the Tigers leading receiver picked up the slack with a game-high 154 receiving yards. Louis was White’s main target Thursday night and the senior had three catches over 20 yards and Malzahn referred to the senior Thursday night as the team’s “real deep threat” going forward. \n“My big focus during the bye week was to get healthy and to try and make big plays after I got through with my nagging injuries,” Louis said. “I knew that my team needed a playmaker to step up and that was me tonight.” \nWhite ended the game with easily his career high of 255 yards passing in his first career start away from Jordan-Hare Stadium on an aggressive early game plan that saw the Bacon Raton, Florida native throwing the ball vertically down the field on a vulnerable Kentucky defense. \n“Coach Malzahn told me he would call the plays that were there and give us the best chance,” White said. “We were aggressive and attacking tonight. All I had to do was hit the open guy.” \nKentucky (4-2, 2-2 in SEC) turned around the momentum in the game during a third quarter push where Wildcats offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson rediscovered Stanley “Boom” Williams on his roster. One of Williams’ first carries of the game went for 60 yards and set up the Wildcats opening score of the game. Williams, who was returning after sitting out the victory over Eastern Kentucky on Oct. 3 with what the school was calling “personal issues” had 74 yards on just five carries in the opening quarter but failed to touch the football at all in a second quarter that was dominated by Auburn. \nAuburn got three total rushing touchdowns from its inside-out running combination of Peyton Barber and Kerryon Johnson to help the confidence of its young quarterback. Barber finished with 92 yards on 26 carries and two more touchdowns in the game. \nAuburn will try to take the momentum of its second SEC road win in the last two seasons when they travel again in eight days to take on Arkansas on Oct. 24.
