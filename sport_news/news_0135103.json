The state brings in the turtles that hatch too late in the season to grow here over the winter. This helps the turtles from likely ending up as a meal in the wild. Part of the challenge is making sure the hatchlings don't get too dependent on the staff.\n\"These guys are a little bit not so much hands-on like people would like to believe that they are. We feed them, we clean up after them, but that's pretty much as much interaction as we try to have with them,\" said Jen Dean of ECHO animal care.\nThe turtles will spend the next eight months growing before they're released into the lake in June. In the meantime, the ones that are healthy enough may eventually go on display for visitors to see.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:23:34.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
