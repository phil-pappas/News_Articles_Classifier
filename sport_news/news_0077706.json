At the Horseshoe, the Penn State running back added a new skill to his stockpile: the stiff-arm.\nAgainst Ohio State, the freshman from Whitehall not only commanded Penn State's offense, but his 194-yard night also prompted an obvious question: What else is Penn State's offense?\nAt this point, it's a collection of erratic talent unable, as quarterback Christian Hackenberg said, to string successful plays together consistently. Especially against defenses capable of limiting Penn State's other vessels beyond Barkley.\nOhio State certainly brought that in a 38-10 victory at Ohio Stadium. The Buckeyes stormed Penn State's pass protection for five sacks, had eight tackles for loss to force long-yardage downs and kept receivers from finding open space downfield all night.\nAs a result, perhaps offensive tackle Andrew Nelson said it best. Nelson shouldered the blame for the offensive line's protections issues but said he was proud that the team began establishing its running identity.\nAn identity that belongs primarily to Barkley.\n\"He's a make-it-right guy,\" Nelson said. \"You may not get everything blocked exactly correctly, but he can make you right and make people miss. Definitely an explosive player.\"\nIn his first game back after missing two due to injury, Barkley introduced himself to the national audience. He became the first running back to top 100 yards against Ohio State this season, doing so on 24 carries that actually lowered his yards-per-carry average.\nBarkley's burst, vision and elusiveness drew gasps from Ohio Stadium's second-largest crowd ever, and his stiff-arm generated some boos. Barkley used it twice: once to gain extra yardage, the second to goad an Ohio State defender into a personal-foul penalty.\n\"If you didn't know Saquon Barkley before tonight, you'd better get to know him,\" ABC's Chris Fowler said on the television broadcast.\nBut what about the rest of the offense? Penn State coach James Franklin began the season by saying that his offense had potentially explosive players across the lineup. That has been the case only intermittently.\nThe Lions' top two plays Saturday not involving Barkley were the result of tremendous individual efforts. Receiver Chris Godwin, about the only wideout who can win in one-on-one coverage, turned a jump ball into a 56-yard reception with a delicate catch and powerful yards thereafter.\nFellow receiver DaeSean Hamilton followed two plays later by taking a covered bubble screen 8 yards for a touchdown. And that was it. The only other receiver to catch a pass was freshman Brandon Polk. The tight ends were shut out.\nAfter a career-game against Indiana, Hackenberg threw a career-low seven completions against the Buckeyes. He clearly played with a second-half gimp that restricted his mobility. Chalk up some of his six incompletions to a patience-testing lack of accuracy through which he has labored all season.\nFurther, the Lions bludgeoned themselves with two mistakes (dropped pass, holding) on their second drive to squelch a possible touchdown. After that, they became too one-dimensional to muster a sustained impact.\nThrough it all, Barkley continued to be a splash play waiting to happen. He entered the game having gained at least 10 yards on nearly 30 percent of his carries.\nAgainst the Buckeyes, Barkley had five carries of 14 or more, including three on consecutive plays in the second quarter. A fourth-quarter run of 56 yards threatened to bring Penn State into a one-possession game.\nBut inside the red zone, where Penn State has a 50-percent success rate in scoring touchdowns, the drive broke down. Most destructively, Penn State went for a 4th-and-2, but Hackenberg was sacked after not finding Barkley open on a short-side swing pass.\nThe play underscored Penn State's protection struggles that have been constant this season. Franklin said that Barkley was the fourth read on the play, and Hackenberg simply didn't have time to get there.\n\"They kept getting push and getting pressure,\" Franklin said of Ohio State's defensive line. \"For Christian to think he's getting back to the fourth progression on a three-step drop is probably not going to happen.\"\nLimited production at Ohio Stadium isn't new for Penn State. Since joining the Big Ten in 1993, the Lions are 2-10 at the Horseshoe, where they have scored 14 or more points just three times.\nSaturday was much of the same, save for Barkley. Even the Ohio Stadium staff was impressed.\nA worker closing down the Horseshoe early Sunday morning called Barkley the best opposing back he has seen in years and sounded nervous about the future.\n\"We're going to have to see him for at least two more years?\" the guy asked. \"That's scary.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:42:35.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
