(Joshua McKerrow) Bob Hough Contact Reporter bhough@capgaznews.com \nWhen St. Mary's got stopped on fourth down at the 1-yard-line early in the second quarter of Monday's game with St. Paul's, momentum seemed to shift to the Crusaders. \nTwo plays later, the Saints got it right back and never relinquished it in a 33-18 victory in a game that was rescheduled from Friday due to the heavy rain in the area. \nDylan Budroni, who scored the Saints' first touchdown on a 12-yard pass from Kevin Sheckells, picked up a loose ball at the 1 and simply stepped into the end zone to help the Saints increase their lead to 14-6. Kyle Godlewski had the initial hit on Bobby Cade Mornhiweg to jar the ball loose and Budroni was in the right place at the right time. \n\"Easily. It was right there,\" said Budroni, when asked if that was the easiest fumble recovery and score he's ever had. \"I know the defense has confidence in its capabilities, but when we take away the ball and score, that's a complete confidence boost.\" \nSt. Mary's (4-2) built an 11-point lead at halftime, but St. Paul's used a 12-play, 77-yard drive that ate up more than seven minutes and made it 17-12 when Quizzon Tarver scored from two yards out with 4:49 left in the third. Read the story \nNeeding to answer, the Saints did just that when they scored the game's next 13 points to take control. \n\"That was huge. You have to answer a score with a score,\" St. Mary's coach Jason Budroni said. \"They came out and had the momentum and drove right down the field on us. But, we came back and took it back.\" \nSheckells hit Chey Dowell for a 13-yard touchdown that answered St. Paul's first score of the second half. After the Crusaders mishandled the snap on a punt, St. Mary's took over at the St. Paul's 23-yard-line and increased its lead four plays later when Patrick Hines followed the block of a pulling Ricky Aufderheide and scored on a 7-yard run to make it 30-12. Annapolis tops Wildcats for first time in decade (Bob Hough) \nThe Crusaders cut it to 30-18 when Jack Wells recovered a fumble in the end zone, but turned the ball over on downs on their next possession. After Cole Randolph's 30-yard field goal pushed the lead to 33-18, Conor Kringel's interception on the first play of the next St. Paul's drive put the game away. \n\"It's a win. We played a little bit sloppy and we can definitely play better,\" Jason Budroni said. \"At the end of the day, though, I'll take it.\" \nRyan Poole and Joe Phelan added interceptions for the Saints, who forced four turnovers. John Marquez broke up a pass in the first half that led to a punt, while Kringel and Robert Smoloski stopped Jack Parr for just a 3-yard gain prior to Poole's interception late in the first half. Kringel also recorded a sack in the second half. \n\"The thing I love about us is we made some mistakes, unfortunately, but the kids played hard,\" Jason Budroni said. \"They're working and constantly hustling, so that part is great.\" \nSheckells finished 16 for 21 for 207 yards and two touchdowns, while Dowell caught seven passes for 131 yards and a score for St. Mary's, which improved to 1-1 in the MIAA B Conference and will face Pallotti, last year's C Conference champion, on Friday. \nSt. Paul's (1-3)6066—18St. Mary's (4-2)710610—33 \nFirst Quarter \nSM — Budroni 12 pass from Sheckells (Randolph kick) \nSP — Madden 5 run (Pass failed) \nSecond Quarter \nSM — Budroni 1 fumble return (Randolph kick) \nSM — Randolph 20 FG \nSP — Tarver 2 run (Run failed) \nSM — Dowell 13 pass from Sheckells (Kick failed) \nFourth Quarter \nSM — Hines 7 run (Randolph kick) \nSP — Wells fumble recovery in end zone (Pass failed) \nSM — Randolph 30 FG \nPASSING: SP — Madden 24-35-2280-3; SM — Sheckells 16-21-207-2-0.
