I'm a dog lover myself. I couldn't imagine doing something like that. It's insane.\"\nA Port Clinton police sergeant, whose partner is K-9 officer Spike, is upset over what was found inside an abandoned backpack.\n\"Me, personally, I would bury the dog in as humane a manner as possible,” says Sgt. Joshua Nelson.\nLast Sunday a mom, dad, and their children were taking a walk in the newly renovated park when their dog started sniffing the trash can.\n40-year-old Amanda Miller of Fremont says her dog wouldn’t leave it alone.\nShe called 9-1-1: “My husband decided to look in and there is a backpack in there. He said it was awfully heavy so I told him to check it out. There is a dead dog in it.”\nThe 9-1-1 Operator gasped and said, “Oh my God.”\nSomeone put a deceased dog in a backpack and left it in the garbage can of the West End Park where children play on the playground and basketball court.\nNelson says it was a small silver, black and brown collie or sheep dog mix without a collar or tag.\n\"It didn't look like anybody had used any sort of weapons on the dog,” says Nelson. “To me it looked like the dog died of natural causes and they disposed of it in there.\"\nNelson says police tried to contact the dog warden and humane society. But when they didn’t hear anything back, Nelson says he disposed of the body in the dumpster behind the police department.\n\"That way no children could see him,” says Nelson. “No passerby could see him.\"\nNelson says it is not against the law to dump a deceased dog in the trash. He says it’s simply a poor moral decision to put the body in a public park.", "external_links": ["http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/85F/F94/85FF94274B9647E99BCD5468FC560221.mp4", "http://up.anv.bz/latest/scripts/anvload.js", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x480&iu=/301721715/WTVG&ciu_szs&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&ad_rule=1&vpos=preroll&env=vp&output=xml_vast2&unviewed_position_start=1&correlator=", "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/353*198/Port+Clinton+park1.JPG", "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Port+Clinton+park1.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:08:13.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
