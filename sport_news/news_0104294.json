I want to continue playing and will work harder to win more tournaments,\" said the excited youngster, who began nervously yesterday.\nYugant lost the first two points of the match as nerves seemed to have taken over. However, as the final progressed, he slowly but surely got into the groove and impressed with some hard-hitting forehands that eventually proved too good for his opponent Dhruv.
