We live in a democracy,\" she said. \"It's Congress, elected by the Brazilian people, that my government must have a dialogue with on getting support for ways and laws to speed up the exit from the crisis.\"\nThe changes cut the former 39 ministries to 31 in Brazil's sprawling bureaucracy.\n\"Today we are making a first and major step toward the reorganization of the federal public administration. We are beginning by reducing eight ministries,\" Rousseff announced.\nA big winner in the reshuffle was the center-right PMDB which is Rousseff's most powerful, but not always reliable, partner in the ruling coalition, along with her leftist Worker's Party. Analysts said Rousseff boosted the PMDB's ministerial portfolio in hopes of winning support for economic reforms that have come under heavy criticism since she unveiled them a month ago.\nThey include spending cuts and the reinstatement of an unpopular tax on banking transactions.\nRousseff said what Brazil needs is political stability so that it can pursue the common goal of restoring economic growth. \"We have to put the interests of the country above those of the parties.\"\nThe PMDB now gets seven ministries, up from six. That included changing the health ministry, which has the biggest budget and considerable political importance, from the Workers' Party to the PMDB.\nThe Workers' Party remains the biggest player with nine ministries.\nBut the reshuffle also reflected internal party shifts and the possibility of party founder and former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva seeking a return to power in the 2018 elections.\nDefense Minister Jacques Wagner, a Lula ally, moved over to the politically key post of presidential chief of staff, replacing a Rousseff confidant.\n\"The president has decided on this reshuffle after pressure from the PMDB and from former president Lula with the hope of reducing the risk of impeachment proceedings,\" said Ricardo Ribeiro, an analyst at MCM consultants. \"She is trying to make sure of the PMDB's support.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:26:35.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
