Stand for respect and understanding with @Rise_To_WIN . #RISEtoWIN https://t.co/fbMsaBEUpB\nâ€” Miami Dolphins (@MiamiDolphins) October 16, 2015 RISE and its partners will sponsor educational programs to teach coaches, players and parents about respect and diversity and how to prevent racially insensitive behavior.\nPublic service announcements will feature some of the biggest names in sports, including four-time National Basketball Association MVP LeBron James and Tom Brady, a four-time Super Bowl champion with the NFL's New England Patriots.\n\"As the sport of Jackie Robinson and other pioneers who followed in his footsteps, we must continue to build upon our progress with mutual respect and understanding through initiatives like RISE,\" said Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred.\nNational Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell also backed the RISE campaign.\n\"We want to use our shared passion for sport to champion equality and respect for all,\" Goodell said.\nTwo leaders of the Change the Mascot campaign, whose goal is to have the NFL's Washington Redskins change their nickname, praised Ross for his efforts to combat racism. National Congress of American Indians Executive Director Jackie Pata and Oneida Nation Representative Ray Halbritter said RISE should spearhead the charge to have the Washington team change its moniker.\n\"It seems a natural fit for the organization to address the outlying NFL franchise in Washington which is not only dividing and isolating people with its offensive team name, but directly denigrating a segment of our nation's population based on their alleged skin color,\" they said Friday in a statement.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/StrongerTogether?src=hash", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "https://twitter.com/RISE_to_Win", "http://www.risetowin.org/", "https://twitter.com/MiamiDolphins", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "https://twitter.com/MiamiDolphins/status/655035597640196097", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/RISEtoWIN?src=hash", "https://t.co/fbMsaBEUpB"], "published": "2015-10-17T06:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T23:57:26.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
