After being forced to punt on their first two possessions, El Dorado’s defense not once but twice answered the bell. McPherson had first and goal on both of their first two possessions, but the Wildcats defense held them short each time. “Our defense is so well coached and play hard each week,” stated El Dorado head coach Jason Nichols. “Those stops were huge, but they’ve been doing that all season long for us.” On their third offensive drive, the Bullpups again were faced with fourth and short deep in the red zone. This time, El Dorado was hit with a penalty giving new hope to the Bullpups. McPherson took advantage of the mistake and opened the scoring with a six-yard touchdown run by Austin Hunt with 6:06 left in the second quarter. El Dorado gained some momentum with 53 seconds left in the half as they recovered a McPherson fumble at the Bullpup 43 yard-line. The Wildcats couldn’t get on the same page offensively and let time tick away, calling a timeout with 13 seconds left before deciding to take a knee and head to the locker rooms. The Bullpups struck again right after halftime as Noah Jirgens powered his way in from six-yards out giving the Bullpups a 21-0 lead. El Dorado had a chance to respond quickly as Cade Morrow found Kody Melugin for what looked to be a 32-yard touchdown pass, but a holding penalty took the points and momentum right back. The Wildcats rebounded and got first and goal from the ten, but El Dorado couldn’t convert as they turned the ball over on downs after failing to punch it in from their own six. The McPherson defense held the shutout for much of the night with 3:16 left to play El Dorado quarterback Cade Morrow took a qb-keeper one-yard to put the Wildcats on the board at 21-7. Pavlovich was pleased with his defensive showing on the night. “El Dorado is well coached and those kids do some great things,” stated Pavlovich. “Our kids played hard and I really like the group we have on that side of the ball.” With the win McPherson improves to 3-2 on the season and will face Winfield next week. Page 2 of 2 - “We’ll start preparing for their single wing offense,” stated Pavlovich. “They always play hard against us and they have some great kids.” El Dorado drops to 1-4 on the season and will face a tough test next week as they head to No. 2 Buhler. “They’re one of the best teams in the state,” said Nichols. “They’re going to come out and say ‘this is who we are, now stop us’. They’re bigger than we are but I think it’ll be a good challenge for us, and hopefully our offense can get something going and give our defense a little break.” By Sports Reporter Adam Sullivan Butler County Times Gazette By Sports Reporter Adam Sullivan Posted Oct. 3, 2015 at 9:43 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T22:56:52.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
