But I got to be honest with the guys I got, the guys on the fourth line. (Bryan) Flynn, (Torrey) Mitchell and Devante Smith-Pelly ... they did a great job (int he first two games), they worked hard, so I have no reason to take them out of the lineup. \n\"This is what I told Paul this morning: 'I wish I played you, I know you're from here. I'm going to need time. I got to be honest with the rest of the players.' Eventually, he'll get a chance. In the meantime, he's got to be a little patient.\" \nA diminutive forward who starred for the Gatineau Olympiques when Claude Giroux was also on the team, Byron has played 138 NHL games -- eight for Buffalo and the rest with Calgary -- during which he has scored 17 goals and 31 assists.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:30:27.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
