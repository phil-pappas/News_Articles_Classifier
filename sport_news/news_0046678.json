Under the terms of his plea agreement, he will avoid a felony conviction as long as he finishes probation and completes the speaking engagements without incident, and his probation could be ended earlier than 18 months if the court so decides. \n“This has been a huge wake-up call for him,” said Jones attorney Vincent Ward. “Ever since he walked away from that car, he’s done everything to make amends.” \nJones, 28, also avoided fines and other restrictions traditionally imposed on parolees such as traveling out of the state and possessing a firearm. \n“I am here to accept full responsibility for what happened, and I hope you can give me an opportunity to redeem myself,” Jones said during the hearing, which UFC President Dana White attended. \nJones allegedly ran a red light while driving a rented Buick SUV in a residential area of Albuquerque, striking a car driven by a pregnant woman. According to witnesses, he fled the scene and then returned to his car to grab a large handful of cash before fleeing again. An off-duty cop identified Jones as he fled. \nPolice found MMA memorabilia and paperwork linking the car to Jones, as well as a marijuana pipe with marijuana, condoms, and snack food. \nPolice sought Jones for questionin g and then issued a warrant for his arrest when they discovered the female driver had suffered a broken arm in the accident. Less than 24 hours later, he turned himself in to police and was released on $2,500 bail. \nWard said Tuesday that the female driver has recovered from her injuries. \nUFC officials ultimately stripped Jones (21-1 MMA, 15-1 UFC), who’s ranked No. 1 the NOS Energy Drink MMA light-heavyweight and pound-for-pound rankings , of his belt and suspended him indefinitely. Daniel Cormier, who fights Alexander Gustafsson in Saturday’s UFC 192 headliner, ultimately won the vacant belt in May after defeating Anthony Johnson. \nProsecutors missed the initial 60-day deadline to move forward on Jones’ case, lacking two pieces of evidence. If a plea agreement hadn’t been reached, a grand jury would have decided whether or not to indict Jones and proceed to a trial. But earlier this month, the case was transferred from Metropolitan Court to Second Judicial District Court and a plea hearing was set . 18 CONNECT 13 TWEET LINKEDIN 5 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://press.sn/1KIEG9m TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T21:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:18:36.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
