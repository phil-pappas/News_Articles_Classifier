After dedicating himself to running over the winter, life seemed to click during his sophomore outdoor track season. When the semester concluded, he had even recorded the first 4.0 GPA of his career. That season he set new personal bests at distances of 1,500 and 5,000 meters, winning the 5K at the UMass Invitational. He reached his goal of a nine-minute steeplechase, taking second in the Atlantic 10 Conference and 11th at the IC4A Outdoor Championships. “I finally got a good base under my belt for the first time,” said Tavares. “In high school, I didn’t do a lot of miles compared to other runners because of wrestling. I never had a complete preseason campaign. Instead of taking the whole winter off, I listened to coach (Ken O’Brien) and did the whole winter, going 70-75 miles a week.” Now a junior, that success has carried over thanks to an increased summer training regiment and a new-found dedication to longer distances. Tavares has been among UMass’ top five cross country runners in all four meets so far this season, finishing as high as second on the team, while bettering his times from his first two seasons in all but one race. It helped that he took just two weeks off after spring track, instead of the four he took off in previous years, which often led to weight gains of 10-15 pounds. Beginning the first week of June, Tavares dedicated himself to a summer schedule that started with 45 miles a week and topped out at 75. He managed that while taking part in the BACCMD program at the UMass Medical Center in Worcester. He returned to New Bedford in July and his two-hour, 18-mile runs would take him from his home near Buttonwood Park to the UMass Dartmouth campus, up Hathaway to the airport and back past New Bedford High School. Before this past year, the longest he’d ever run was 12 miles, when he mirrored the course of the New Bedford Half Marathon in high school. In early September practices with the Minutemen, he immediately saw the benefit of his improved fitness level. “I haven’t fallen off any workouts yet,” he said. “That happened as a freshman about half the time. My sophomore year it happened two or three times. I’ve been with the guys in the front and feeling pretty good.” The payoff wasn’t evident in his first race this fall, when he finished 24 seconds slower than his sophomore year in the season-opening Minuteman Invitational. But then, at the Battle in Beantown, a week later, he took 50 seconds off his 2014 time and moved up 22 spots. During the Paul Short Invitational, he ran four seconds faster and finished 18 spots higher. At the New England Championship, he cut 14 seconds off his previous time and crossed the finish line 62 spots higher. The Beantown race was his best of the year, he noted, and said he used a new in-race strategy, racing out with the front pack and trying to hold on, rather than starting farther back and moving up throughout the race. “I tried to do things a little differently and race in front and take it from there,” he said. “I ran with our lead guy a little bit, and I just hung on and had a pretty good PR.” Tavares’ time at the Battle in Beantown was 25:21, the closest he’s come to the elusive 25-minute mark at eight-kilometers, which carries parallels with his academic quest for a 4.0 GPA, or his quest to slip under 16 minutes (5k) in high school (which he did once). After three semesters with a GPA between 3.7 and 3.92, the pre-med biology major finally achieved perfection in the second semester of his sophomore year. “Once you achieve that, you set a standard for yourself,” he said. “I’ve been focusing on my tests, trying to get eight hours of sleep.” Tavares plans on applying to medical school next year and said the BACCMD program gave him a cliff’s notes introduction to varying fields of medicine, from pediatrics to surgery to OBGYN. “You got to shadow the ER at UMass Medical to see if you can stomach things,” he said. “Luckily, I have a good stomach for stuff. It was definitely one of the biggest experiences of my life.” But before he becomes Dr. Tavares, Paolo hopes to lead the Minutemen to a top-four finish in the Atlantic-10 Conference, preferably with a top-15 showing individually. “We lost two seniors last year, so that put us in a hole, and we had another injury, so we had to fill in the gaps,” he said. “Luckily, we had a couple of freshmen who are sophomores now who stepped up and they’re consistent. I think we’re, hopefully, going to finish top four, or better.” As for Tavares going sub-25 minutes on an eight-kilometer course? “I think I’m close,” he said.
