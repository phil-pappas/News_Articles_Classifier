Barrett Saturday, Ohio State re-discovered Braxton Miller.\n1. In his previous three games, Miller had 10 touches of the ball, accounting for 53 yards of total offense (nine rushes for 32 yards, three receptions for 18, one pop pass on a jet sweep for 3 yards).\nIn the previous game at Indiana, on two touches, Miller had a puny net of 5 yards.\nSaturday, Miller got eight touches for 90 yards (three carries for 11 yards, five receptions for 79 yards) and scored his third touchdown of the season on a 19-yard pass from Jones. It was his first score since his sizzling debut against Virginia Tech.\n\"I hope you guys get to see him (note: we didn't),\" said Urban Meyer. \"Because he had a nice smile on his face.\"\n2. Cardale Jones might have led Ohio State to the national championship, but, boy, has he slumped!\nThis, at any rate, seems to be the fan consensus on the Glenville product. He has 288 yards, 245 yards and 291 yards passing in his last three games, the biggest figure coming Saturday at the Horseshoe.\nWhen Jones passed for similar numbers — 257, 243 and 242 yards — in OSU's three postseason games last season, he was the fulfillment of every third stringer's dreams and most popular man in Columbus and his hometown of Cleveland.\nMeyer fielded a question after the 49-28 rout of Maryland in which it was observed that Jones had not been \"completely marginalized.\n\"I think he was great. He played his best game since last year,\" said Meyer.\n3. The labor division between Jones (almost everything up to the red zone) and Barrett (inside it) might not be revolutionary. But it's much better than splitting Jones wide when Miller is in the wildcat.\nHow much of a receiving threat did Jones pose? (On a scale of 1 to 100, maybe a 1.5?)\nEven Jim Tressel's staff, when Todd Boeckman and Terrelle Pryor were on the field together in the 2009 Fiesta Bowl, managed to draw up a play on which Boeckman hit Pryor for a touchdown.\n4. Ezekiel Elliott said the Maryland game was Ohio State's most complete offensive game of the year. Grammarians know \"most nearly complete\" is the correct term, since completion is an absolute. Still, the most nearly completely criminal under-use of J.T. Barrett ended.\n5. The Ohio State defense, after surrendering an 81-yard touchdown run to QB Zander Diamant of Indiana, gave up a 75-yard bolt to surprise starter Perry Hills of Maryland.\nHills gained 170 yards on the ground with the long run's boost and passed for 133, including a beautifully conceived 52-yard touchdown throw off a play-fake on the Terps' first series.\n6. I know this sounds somewhat like Butch Davis extolling the Browns' defense against Jamal Lewis the day the Ravens running back shook free just long enough to gain 295 yards. But ... the Hills lapses offset a strong defensive effort.\nHills was only 10 for 27 with two picks in the air. Ohio State registered four sacks (Tyquan Lewis, two; Joey Bosa and Joshua Perry, one each) and eight tackles for loss. The Buckeyes had 499 yards of total offense to 386 for the Terps, with almost one-third of that coming on Hills' big run and throw.\n7. Elliott battered and banged for an 11 th straight 100-yard game. Still, he only missed by one yard in registering another \"explosive\" play with a long gain of 19 yards.\n8. Other streaks: 19 straight Ohio State wins, 26 straight Big Ten Conference regular season wins, and, not a streak, just a stat to savor, a 44-3 record for Ohio State under Meyer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:32:50.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
