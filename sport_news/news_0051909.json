SPECIAL TO THE RECORD New Milford forward Alexis Monroy has 23 goals this season and 102 for her career. \n-- Lost in the aftermath of Clifton 's 4-2 shootout win over Lakeland (9-4-1) in Saturday's Passaic County tournament semifinal was the stellar play of Lancers senior goalie Jenna Bracken. She made 10 saves, including several tough ones late in regulation and through two overtime periods, against the undefeated Mustangs. \n-- Northern Highlands remained the top-ranked team in the USA Today/NSCAA Super 25 and SIMA Fab 50 national polls Tuesday. Immaculate Heart came in at No. 21 and Ramapo registered at No. 42 in the SIMA Fab 50. All three teams, along with Ridgewood, will play in Sunday's BCT semifinals. \n-- Immaculate Heart sophomore Rebecca Jarrett, who recently committed to Virginia, just returned from a week-long trip to California to train with the U-16 United States girls national team from Oct. 11-18. The training camp, which was concurrently with the U-17 team, featured 24 players from across the nation and was run by U.S. women's development coach Tricia Taliaferro, the head coach at the University of Miami from 2001-2010. \n-- Despite not starting her high school season until Sept. 22 after playing with the U-19 Portugese women's national team, North Arlington senior Joanna Seca has accumulated 18 goals and 18 assists in 12 games. She has led the Vikings, 12-2 entering Tuesday, to six straight wins. \n-- After playing to a 1-all draw in the season opener, NV/Old Tappan seized control of the Big North National with a key 4-0 win over Pascack Valley on Oct. 13. Jazzin Clark, Jordan DeCrescente, Taylor Newman and Kelly Walsh scored for NV/OT, which improved to 6-0-1 in league play. \n-- Sandwiched between a pair of 4-0 losses to national No. 1 Northern Highlands last week, No. 14 Paramus tied a Ridgewood team playing as well as it has all season, receiving goals from Lorraine Moffitt and Shannon O'Brien and six saves from goalie Nicole DiPasquale. \n-- With a two-game lead and two league games remaining, Cliffside Park (6-0) — led by Kathleen Silva, Amanda Batista and Seray Kurtis — already has clinched at least a share of the Big North American division title. \n-- The state tournament seeding meeting will be Oct. 28.
