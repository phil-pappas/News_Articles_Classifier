I think I've hit the green four times. I just had a good feeling. I can't believe it went in.\" \nIt is believed to be only the second ace on a par 4 in USGA amateur competition. Derek Ernst accomplished the feat on the 299-yard eighth hole at Bandon Trails in the 2011 U.S. Amateur Public Links. \n\"I win 14 (the 32nd hole in the 36-hole file) and I'm thinking maybe we can get back in this,\" Dull said. \"I didn't hit a good tee shot, and when a guy jars it on a par 4, what are you going to do? You just shake his hand and laugh it off. It was an amazing shot that he hit.\" \nSchmitz is a regional director for a health care services company. He played at St. John's University in Minnesota and is a three-time Minnesota Golf Association Player of the Year. \n\"It's not real yet,\" Schmitz said. \"It feels real good. It's been a long week, a long nine days being away from my two little girls at home. I'm pretty happy and proud.\" \nThe 29-year-old Dull, from Lakeland, Florida, also is a reinstated amateur. He played at Florida Southern and works as a caddie at Streamsong Resort. \n\"This is by far the most golf I've ever played in a row,\" Dull said. \"I wouldn't say that had anything to do with it. I don't feel tired. I don't feel fatigued. I just didn't have it today. He played well. He made the putts when he had to make them.\" \nThe event is limited to players 25 and older. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:30:15.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
