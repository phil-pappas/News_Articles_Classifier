(AP Photo/Alessandra Tarantino) \nROME — Dismissing speculation that he could run for mayor, the head of Italy's Olympic committee pledged Friday to keep his current job and attempt to bring the 2024 Games to Rome. \n\"Rome — my city which I love — deserves a government that is up to the challenge for the good of everyone and for national prestige,\" Giovanni Malago said. \"We are working to try and bring the 2024 Olympics to the capital of Italy. This, and only this, is my vision for the future.\" \nMalago issued his statement a day after Rome Mayor Ignazio Marino resigned following a scandal over his expense accounts. \nMalago has been mentioned as possible future candidate for mayor for years, and media speculation of a possible move heightened after Marino's resignation. \nRome bid leader Luca Corder di Montezemolo said the candidacy would not be affected by a mayoral change. \nHowever, if a member of the opposition 5-Star Movement is elected, it could mean trouble for the bid. \nMalago was elected CONI president in 2013. \n\"I am absolutely devoted to supporting the organization and reform of Italian sport to the best of my capabilities, making it more and more one of the shining lights of our country,\" Malago said. \nThe other 2024 candidates are Paris, Los Angeles, Hamburg and Budapest. \nThe International Olympic Committee will select the host city in 2017. \nItalian Premier Matteo Renzi announced Rome's 2024 bid last year, and Marino officially submitted the candidacy to the IOC last month. \nAndrew Dampf can be followed at http://www.twitter.com/asdampf \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:23:18.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
