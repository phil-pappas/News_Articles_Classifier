(Photo: Matthew Emmons, USA TODAY Sports)\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE IRVING, Texas - Dez Bryant did not participate in Wednesday’s practice for the Dallas Cowboys, and coach Jason Garrett said the wide receiver took part only in some drills off to the side.\n“We’ll just see how he’s feeling,” Garrett said before the Cowboys practiced Wednesday. “We don’t anticipate much from him in the formal team setting. He is working on the side, and if he can work in, he will work in.”\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones suggested in a Dallas radio interview on Tuesday that there was a chance Bryant could play in Sunday’s game at the New York Giants. Bryant broke his right foot in the season-opening victory against the Giants on Sept. 13.\nUSA TODAY\nBell: Welcome to the NFC Least, the division no one wants to win\n“Everybody will get a feel for it, but more importantly he will get a feel for it,” Jones said on KRLD-FM. “He is the key. He will have to decide: Does he push off on it? This is strictly, ‘Do you feel comfortable making your cut?’ If you do, it’s on go. And if you are not, then we will wait a week.”\nThe Cowboys (2-3) host the Seattle Seahawks following the game in New York. The Cowboys have publicly said that Bryant was expected to return four to six weeks after he underwent surgery Sept. 14.\nUSA TODAY FANTASY SPORTS\nWeek 7 injury report: What to do with Dez Bryant if he dresses\nBryant recently had a stem-cell injection in his foot. And last week he was seen on the practice field participating in resistance cord training with Britt Brown, the Cowboys associate athletic trainer.\n“Any time a player comes off an injury, conditioning is a factor,” Garrett said. “He has to be physically ready to play, and when you have a leg injury or a foot injury sometimes that conditioning gets compromised. You have to condition in different ways. There’s a lot of different machines you can use to help you get in condition. The best way to get in condition is to be on a practice field practicing in your football pads and cleats. Dez is a veteran player. He understands how to get himself ready to play.”\nFollow Eric Prisbell on Twitter @EricPrisbell .\nVIDEO PLAYLIST: LATEST FROM THE NFL NFL Daily Blitz: Eagles sticking with Bradford | 01:26 The biggest topics of the day in the NFL.
