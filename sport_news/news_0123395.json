He died at Christ Hospital at 6:10 am Friday, according to the medical examiner’s office.\nSmith is the seventh high school football player in the country to die from game-related injuries this season.\n“It was a kick return play,” Stagg Stadium announcer Jimmy Smith said. “(Smith) was running and a guy blocked him, hit him pretty good and that was it. He went down and he got back up and walked backed to the visitor’s side of the field.”\nGarret Weston, the paramedic that first treated Smith, said he wasn’t sure what play Smith was injured on.\n“I didn’t notice anyone come out of the game or anything like that,” Weston said. “I was on the home side of the field (Bogan was on the visiting side).\nWeston said he was called over just as he was starting to walk out of the stadium.\n“I was on my out and then they told me someone collapsed,” Weston said. “They told me he was hit in the helmet and he had a headache. He was unconscious by the time I got to him. I checked his vitals and gave him oxygen.”\nSmith started high school at Rich Central and transferred to Bogan last year.\n“He was just an exciting kid,” Cantrell Davis, a good friend who played football with Smith at Rich Central, said. “He liked to go shopping more than anything. He always said that money comes and money goes so you might as well go shopping.”\nSmith played on the basketball team and ran track his first year of high school. He was hoping to walk on with the football team at Western Illinois next year.\n“He was just a great kid, never negative,” Davis said. “He smile was just perfect.”\nAnother friend, Chris Jenkins, said Smith’s favorite artist was the rapper Future. Smith had two sisters and a brother.\n“Harold’s Chicken was his favorite thing in the world,” Davis said. “When he walked in to the Harold’s in Matteson they knew his order, six piece with mild. He didn’t even have to say anything.”\nChicago Fire Media Affairs Director Larry Langford said an ambulance was called about 6 p.m. Thursday to Stagg Elementary at 7424 S. Morgan St.\nThe teenager “was unconscious but was breathing when he was taken in critical condition” to Advocate Christ, Langford said. He did not know the nature of the injury.\nAn autopsy on Smith, of the 4200 block of 188th Street in Country Club Hills, is scheduled for Saturday, the medical examiner’s office said.\n“For all of us at Chicago Public Schools, our hearts are heavy and saddened this morning to learn that one of our student athletes at Bogan High School has passed away,” CPS CEO Forrest Claypool said in a statement. “CPS grief counselors are on-site at Bogan to provide counseling for our students. We ask that you respect the privacy of the student’s family and keep them in your thoughts and prayers.”\nContributing: Jeff Mayes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:43:53.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
