The Vineyarders (2-2, 1-1 EAC) have now lost seven straight to Bishop Feehan (1-3, 1-0 EAC), getting shut out for the third time since 2009 against their Eastern Athletic Conference rival. “Great defensive effort on our part. Not so great offensive effort,” Martha’s Vineyard coach Donald Herman said. “We’ve always struggled to score points against Bishop Feehan.” Cayer’s field goal came with 34 seconds left in the second quarter. The Vineyarders’ defense stepped up in the second half and limited Bishop Feehan to just 50 yards of total offense, but Martha’s Vineyard couldn’t do much better when it had possession. Senior linebacker Austin Chandler led the defensive charge for the Vineyarders, recording 15 tackles overall and two for losses in his first game back from a knee injury. Senior Jacob Cardoza had an interception, and senior Ben Clark and sophomore Zachary Moreis each recovered a fumble.

The Blue Knights had an 11-2 advantage in corners, but Falmouth (3-1-2) kept the game close thanks to three saves by goalie Molly Duff-Still and solid defense from left midfielder Jordan Willis.
