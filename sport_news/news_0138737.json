I want to do what makes me happy, and what makes me happy is winning a championship,'\" Williams said at Cavaliers Media Day. \n\"And where do I want to win a championship? There's no other place than here. That was my mind frame going into free agency, and it maybe took a week to get a deal done. I couldn't get them up on the money, but it was cool.\" \nThe first of a handful of players to score at least 50 points in a game last season, Williams looks forward to competing for an NBA Championship, as well as helping to develop the skills of all-star point guard Kyrie Irving. \n\"I started the trend, and then, Kyrie wanted to show out and do it twice, which that's not fair,\" Williams said with his trademark smile. \"I'm glad I'm a teammate. You think about it, obviously, he did it twice, I did it once, and I think it was done five or six times in the season last year. We all know we have a lot of firepower. J.R. can get going. Obviously, 'Bron is 'Bron. Kyrie, myself, we've got guys that can get it going. We've got a lot of pieces, Delly (Matthew Dellavedova), Andy (Varejao) coming back. Those guys' intangibles, they're just as important as me scoring 50 points. \n\"I'm excited about every piece we have on this team. Obviously, I'm not coming back to play 45 minutes a night, so I'm just coming in to give my part, spell those guys some minutes, play multiple positions. If somebody goes down, be able to fill that void, but at the end of the day, my goal is to come back and be a great teammate, help the development, continued development of Kyrie because he's still a youngin. At the end of the day, (to) win a championship, that's my main goal.\" \nDuring his first run with the Cavaliers, Williams averaged 25.5 points, 8.1 assists, 4.9 rebounds and 1.5 steals over 186 games, but now, rather than being just a scorer or a distributor, he is looking to embrace any responsibilities given to him from the coaches. \n\"I'm in my 13th year in the NBA, so it's a privilege to be on any basketball team in this league,\" Williams said. \"I'm just happy, for my 13th year, to be healthy and to be able to contribute on a basketball team for one, but honestly, I can't echo it enough. I love it here, so coming to work is fun. \n\"I can score in a variety of different ways, with the ball, without the ball. I think that's what makes me valuable to a team, being that I can play multiple positions and things like that, so that's how I train, to be able to be an asset in a lot of different ways. Obviously, the more you can do for a team, the more opportunities you can have to be on the floor. \n\"Obviously, playing with 'Bron and getting to play off the ball, shooting the ball real well, being that I wasn't that player before I came here, after I left, I think a lot of teams saw value in me and I think I kind of slid into that role on a lot of teams. It was a strength in me. I think I found it when I came here, so obviously, when I left, it was a part of who I've been as a player.\" \nAnd who Williams is as a player now is someone ready to keep the Cavaliers at the top of the Eastern Conference and knocking on the door to take that one step further to win an NBA Championship. \n\"From afar, I was excited,\" Williams said. \"To be honest with you, I always pulled for this organization, even when I wasn't here. I just wanted them to do well. Obviously, I was excited for the city, just the success that they endured last year and want it to just carry over to this year. I'm happy to be a part of it this year, to say that I actually have something to do with it because I think this city does deserve it. It'll be a great feeling to do something fulfilling for this city.\" 2 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1LPwvK7 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:30:28.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
