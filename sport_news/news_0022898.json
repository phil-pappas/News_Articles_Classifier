He took off his helmet and bowed down on the turf in celebration.\nShafiq also completed his century with a sweep boundary off leg-spinner Adil Rashid as the pair erased the previous best fifth wicket stand of 219 set by Paul Collingwood and Eoin Morgan at Nottingham in 2010.\nMalik, recalled to the Test side after five years, has so far hit 24 boundaries and three sixes during his 400-ball knock, having come in to bat in the third over of the match.\nShafiq too has batted with resolve, knocking ten boundaries of 215 balls.\nMalik resumed at 124 and hit a four and six off wicket-less Rashid before smashing a boundary off seamer Mark Wood to better his previous best score as well as completing 150.\nHis previous best of 148 not out came against Sri Lanka in Colombo in 2006.\nBoth Malik and Shafiq left England bowlers to toil further and ruing the two chances they failed to grab against the two batsmen.\nMalik was caught off a Stuart Broad's no-ball on 40 and Shafiq was let off by Ian Bell off Anderson when on ten -- both on Tuesday.\nAnderson was England's most successful bowler with 2-42.\nBoth England's spinners -- debutant Rashid and Moeen Ali -- failed to make an impact on a pitch which is expected to take turn as the game progressed.\nRashid, who was hit for three sixes by Malik, is wicket-less in his 34 overs conceding 163 runs -- the worst figures in an innings on debut.\nPreviously Australia's Bryce McGain had the worst figures of 149-0 on debut against South Africa at Cape Town in 2009.
