This week, it’s an entirely different story. \nBuilding off a tough Week 2 loss against Selinsgrove, Mount Carmel has won three straight games and rolls into Tigers Stadium on Friday night looking to take sole possession of first place in the Heartland Athletic Conference Division II. \nBut the winning streak for the Red Tornadoes (3-2) has had some casualties and also some heroes. \nFreshman quarterback John Ayers, who has stepped up and become a leader for Mount Carmel in running the new shotgun-wing offense, was injured in Week 4 against Central Mountain. \n“John is day to day,” said Mount Carmel coach John Darrah. \nSophomore Tommy Campbell, who competed with Ayers through the summer for the spot, has stepped in and done a solid job. \nBut in their search for new offense, the Red Tornadoes installed a Wildcat-style offense that features running back Kyle Karycki. \nAnd to say that the new offense worked would be an understatement. \nKarycki ran for a school-record 368 yards last week against Danville and has 898 yards and nine touchdowns. \nThe Red Tornadoes will be without top receiver Wesley Shurock, who was ejected from the Danville game last week. \nMount Carmel knows it can’t be one-dimensional against the Tigers (5-0), but with the two different looks on offense, they give Southern Columbia enough to prepare for heading into Friday. \nBut it also looks like what Mount Carmel does best on offense is what Southern does best on defense. \nThe Tigers have allowed just 648 yards on the ground this season — an average of 130 yards a game — and is allowing 4.4 yards per carry. \n“Our defense is playing really well at the moment,” said Southern Columbia coach Jim Roth. “We have had two really solid games in a row on that side of the ball.” \nThe Tigers offense has been rolling along like usual. \nAfter missing one week with a shoulder injury, senior quarterback Nick Becker has picked up where he left off, going 19-for-37 for 447 yards. \nThe Tigers rushing game has been racking up the yards to the sound of an amazing 300 yards a game. \nLeading the way has been junior tailback Hunter Thomas, who has rushed for 469 yards and nine touchdowns and has also caught eight passes for 262 yards and three scores. He leads the team in rushing, receiving and scoring. \nSenior tailback Blake Marks has rushed for 436 yards and five scores while senior fullback Jared Torres has 255 yards and four touchdowns. \nThe game might just come down to turnovers, as the Tigers have turned the ball over nine times this year but have also forced nine turnovers. Mount Carmel, on the other hand, has turned the ball over just four times and forced 11.
