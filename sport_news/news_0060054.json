Thibodeau did so as the defensive guru of Doc Rivers' Celtics teams. \nThere is the Jazz, whose 19-10 post-All-Star Game record painted Utah as an up-and-coming threat to the Western Conference playoff picture because of the fierce rim protection of Rudy Gobert. That second-half surge left Gobert, a 7-2 Frenchman nicknamed the \"Stifle Tower,\" fifth in the league's Defensive Player of the Year voting and with a mountain of hype higher than the French Alps about him being the game's next premier defensive center. \nThibodeau rightfully deserves praise for constantly maximizing on-court defensive effort from his players, as does Gobert for becoming a force in the paint, leading the entire league in block rate - he swatted 7 percent of his opponents' shots while he was on the court. This Sixers team should still be mentioned in the same breath as Chicago and Utah defensively. \nThinking that a Sixers team so horrid offensively should be at least above-average defensively is a fair argument, but that undercuts the strides Brown has made while turning a young roster consisting mostly of D-League veterans into a cohesive unit that prides itself on effort and team defense. \nMore important, Brown has led Nerlens Noel on a path to defensive stardom. \nPhiladelphia might be used to big men who dominate on both sides of the court, such as Wilt Chamberlain and Moses Malone, from glory years that feel like centuries ago. But it's not hyperbole to think that Noel could have the defensive impact that Dikembe Mutombo once had while playing with Allen Iverson or Tyson Chandler had as the defensive anchor and second-best player on the 2010-11 Dallas Mavericks next to Dirk Nowitzki. \nNoel's wiry frame, once his biggest knock as an NBA prospect, has secretly been a blessing. Sure, it's not helping him pulverize opposing bigs on the low block offensively, but that's an unrealistic expectation for the former Kentucky Wildcat. Where it does aid him is in his quest to become one of the NBA's elite defensive stars. \nThose long, quick arms allow him to switch out and guard players on the perimeter, in addition to protecting the paint, as he racks up both gaudy steal and block numbers. Noel's steal rate of 2.9 percent and block rate of 5 percent last season were a historic combination. The last three players with swift enough to nab that many steals and strong enough to swat that many shots are Andrei Kirilenko, who accomplished the feat three times, David Robinson and Hakeem Olajuwon, who did so twice, per Basketball-Reference. \nSo, for reference, Noel caused havoc and turnovers last season with the same propensity as the most versatile defender of the 21st century and two of the greatest centers of all time. He was also a rookie who couldn't legally buy a drink until April. \nThere will, however, be an adjustment period to begin this season just as there have been in the past two years with a roster that has seen so much upheaval. Jahlil Okafor will present fit issues with Noel on both ends of the court. The Sixers will miss Luc Mbah a Moute's leadership and defensive versatility. \nIt will continue to take time to build a roster worthy of a true contender, but at least Brown and Noel have given this team an identity - a scrappy, hustling core led by an all-world defender with a goofy grin a and flattop haircut - for the ride there. \nOn Twitter: @shamus_clancy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:41:43.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
