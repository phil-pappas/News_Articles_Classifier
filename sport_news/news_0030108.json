Subscribe today!\nKEVIN DURANT IS quietly shooting free throws at the Thunder practice facility, his face expressionless. Dribble, spin, breathe, shoot. During games, he sometimes adds the slightest of shoulder shimmies, but on this Monday morning before training camp, he plays it straight. Dribble, spin, breathe, shoot. On the basket to his right, teammate Russell Westbrook is deep into his own routine. He breathes from his belly, taking his right hand up toward the top of his chest as he inhales, then swiping it down and away as he exhales, as if exorcising something.\nUtley eligible to play, no hearing Monday\nHaden: It was very clear that Sarkisian is not healthy\nExpect Jamaal Charles to have full recovery\nCould Ray Rice fill RB void in Kansas City? sc\nTwo young superstars putting in work, alone and together.\n\"Kevin was on one basket at 8 this morning; Russell was on the other,\" says Thunder assistant Maurice Cheeks. \"Same as they always are.\"\nIn the past five seasons, Oklahoma City has won 266 games, second only to the gold standard set by the Spurs. Durant has won an MVP award, an All-Star Game MVP and four scoring titles. Westbrook has won a scoring title and an All-Star Game MVP. But they are still chasing their first NBA title. With Durant hitting unrestricted free agency next summer amid whispers of discord between them, this season might be their last chance to grab it.\nNot long ago, their future together seemed limitless. In 2009, when both players were 21, Cheeks would routinely ask coach Scott Brooks, \"Did you know they were this good?\" By 2012, headed to the NBA Finals, it seemed obvious how good the Thunder could be. It was a matter of how many titles, not when they'd win their first.\nSince then, each attempt has ended in lament. A 60-win season was ruined when Houston guard Patrick Beverley crashed into Westbrook's knee in the opening round of the 2013 playoffs.\nA 59-win season unraveled after Serge Ibaka's calf gave out before the 2014 Western Conference finals. And last season, a foot injury cost Durant 55 games and Oklahoma City missed the playoffs.\nNBA history is filled with great teams with rotten luck. Ask Mike D'Antoni and Steve Nash about 2005 and Joe Johnson's broken face. Sacramento fans still can't believe Vlade Divac tipped the ball right to Robert Horry in 2002. But OKC's string of bad fortune -- and the promise wasted -- is almost unprecedented. \"If [Oklahoma City] doesn't win in the next few years, we'll be looked at similarly to Seattle, with Vin Baker, Brent Barry, Gary Payton, Shawn Kemp,\" says ex-Thunder guard Reggie Jackson, now in Detroit. He blames himself for mistakes. He replays critical plays that went the wrong way. He wonders what might have been if Beverley's knee had hit Westbrook's at a slightly different angle.\n\"At the time I remember thinking we could still win. Next man up, you know?\"\nThat's how confident they were back then. Too young to know how many things have to line up for a team to make it to even one NBA Finals, let alone start a dynasty.\nDurant is 27 now. Westbrook is 26. They know now. This year's Thunder team is arguably the best one on which either has played. If Durant re-signs with Oklahoma City next summer and Westbrook follows suit in 2017, the Thunder will remain contenders for years. If one or both of them leave, it's time to rebuild. So much of that depends on how this season ends. Will they stay healthy? Will they play together? Will they be lucky? Will they win?\nExcept for platitudes spoken at Team USA media scrums and a Players' Tribune pledge to control his own narrative, Durant stayed quiet this summer. But during the first week of training camp, his coolness cracked after ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith suggested LA is his \"primary objective\" if he leaves Oklahoma. \"Nobody in my family, my friends, they don't talk to Stephen A. Smith. So he's lying,\" Durant said.\nSmith responded on Twitter: \"It just appears that @KDTrey5 needs to learn something about today's world in professional sports: We don't have to talk TO HIM to talk ABOUT HIM! Folks like ME will still be here. Watching! Listening! Waiting! Reporting! Whether he likes it or not. While he's here and long and after he's gone. Time to get used to it.\"\nIt could've degenerated into an ugly back-and-firth. But Durant let it go after that. He's trying to stay disciplined about his vow of silence. The season will be chaotic and emotional. Durant knows that. He doesn't want to get swallowed up in it by giving thoughts of free agency too much weight too soon. \"I hope that every time he's asked about it this year, every single time, he will say, 'I'll talk about this after the season,'?\" teammate Nick Collison says.\nOn media day at camp, Durant isn't all smiles while posing for the official OKC team photos, and when a videographer says, \"Hey, KD, just wanted to catch up with you on media day,\" he scoffs, \"It's always media day.\" But then teammate Enes Kanter asks him to take a selfie, and Durant beams. His nature is to connect with people, but having the game taken away from him last season hardened his resolve. Assistant Royal Ivey remembers one point last season when Durant was unable to get off the couch without help: \"I felt for him because this is all he is.\"\nDurant's mood lightens again during a joint interview with Westbrook near the end of the day. Team broadcaster Michael Cage is asking the questions, but there's a problem: one stool, two players. Durant and Westbrook look at each other and shrug. They sit together, cheek to cheek.\nTHE OFFICE OF Thunder GM Sam Presti is an open book. Hundreds of magnets decorate the walls, each with a bit of wisdom he has collected: focus on the signal, not the noise; optimism is the engine for resilience; to build is immortal. His shelves are filled with architecture and music books. There are pictures of his dorm room when he was a guard at Emerson College and of the seats he shared with San Antonio GM R.C. Buford when he worked there. There's a photo of a Thunder jersey hanging on a fallen tree in Moore, Oklahoma, sometime after a category EF5 tornado destroyed the town in 2013. And there's a picture of Bill Walsh, moments before a Super Bowl, lying on the locker room floor, arms crossed behind his head. \"Preparation,\" Presti says.\nHe gives a tour to every player the team considers signing. It starts at the Thunder's gleaming practice facility, where every detail has been scrutinized, down to the ideal height of each electrical socket, then moves on to the team's older practice facility, a converted roller-skating rink. The tour finishes at the museum commemorating the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Presti prefers to visit the Memorial at night, when it is most striking. He can tell which players understand the magnitude of what happened there.\nBefore a recent tour, he studies the evening sky. \"You get these incredible reds out here,\" he says. Rookie coach Billy Donovan is on the lawn behind the practice facility, sweating through his long-sleeve gray shirt. Donovan starts sprinting. Thirty seconds at full speed, a minute to recover. Thirty seconds at full speed, a minute to recover. Over and over again, until he can't do it anymore. After the team missed the playoffs last season, Presti fired Brooks and hired Donovan from the University of Florida, looking for a new voice to lead the team into this pivotal season.\nIf Durant stays, everything they've built here endures and other small-market teams that have tried to replicate what the Thunder have done well -- teams like Orlando, Utah and Milwaukee -- have the same chance. But the NBA's new nine-year, $24 billion media rights deal with ESPN and Turner Sports complicates the Thunder's efforts to re-sign Durant in 2016. The new revenue is projected to spike the salary cap by $20 million next summer, giving virtually every team the war chest to pursue Durant, instead of just the handful that had sacrificed to make room under the old cap. It is anathema to what the NBA and its owners fought for in the 2011 lockout and a hell of a curveball to throw at one of the league's most successful small-market franchises. Asked how he feels about the economic shift, Presti bites his tongue and points to a magnet on his office wall that reads: Forget It, Jake, It's Chinatown.\nIf Durant or Westbrook leaves before they win a title together, Presti's thrifty decision to deal James Harden to Houston after the 2012 Finals will loom large. Would he have done the trade if he'd known the cap would expand this year? Did he miss something?\n\"It would mean that we would've been the only team to act upon that type of information,\" Presti says coolly.\nInstead, he chose to pay Ibaka and fund a deeper bench. He stockpiled picks to replenish the talent, casting off underperforming assets before they were in line for a payday. The idea was to develop players on rookie-scale deals so Durant could picture a future in Oklahoma City.\nCan Donovan, a gifted college recruiter, paint that picture? This moment isn't about wooing, it's about winning, he says: \"My responsibility is, How do I help him grow? How do I help him get better?\"\nPresti has been studying Durant, and those questions, for more than a decade.\n\"I don't know if anyone could've done more due diligence on Kevin Durant than Sam Presti did,\" says Rick Barnes, Durant's coach for his one season at Texas. \"I'll never forget him saying to me, 'I've got to get this right. I've got to be right.'?\"\nHis read on Durant's priorities remains unchanged -- he will go where he can win. Durant left his home in Washington, D.C., to play high school ball at Oak Hill Academy up in the Blue Ridge Mountains. \"It's just books and basketball here,\" says coach Steve Smith. \"We don't even lock the gym at night.\" KD didn't know how to drive until he was 18 years old, when, finally, Ivey taught him. Former UT assistant Russell Springmann remembers him sleeping on a teammate's air mattress the summer after his rookie season. \"He could've afforded the largest suite on the lake,\" says Springmann, who later named his first-born son Durant. \"But he's sleeping on an air mattress in Justin Mason's apartment because that's Kevin Durant.\"\nLeBron James left his hometown Cavaliers in 2010 because the second-best player in Cleveland was Mo Williams and none of the desperate Hail Mary passes the Cavaliers tried -- trading for Shaquille O'Neal or Antawn Jamison -- got him any closer to winning a championship. Miami had stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh . Four years later, when Cleveland had the talent, he went home.\n\"Every guy is loyal to a certain extent,\" says Wade, who had workouts with Durant this summer. \"Look at [Kevin Garnett]. He was loyal to a fault in Minnesota, but he left to win. \"As a player, when you have the muscle, you better use it,\" adds Wade, who was with James on a charter flight from Las Vegas to Miami on the night he decided to return to the Cavs. \"It's a business.\"", "external_links": ["http://media.video-cdn.espn.com/motion/2015/1012/dm_151012_mlb_cora_utley_appeal_wont_beheard/dm_151012_mlb_cora_utley_appeal_wont_beheard_default.jpg", "http://media.video-cdn.espn.com/motion/2015/1012/dm_151012_ncf_haden_presser_on_sark/dm_151012_ncf_haden_presser_on_sark_default.jpg", "http://media.video-cdn.espn.com/motion/2015/1012/dm_151012_nfl_adickes_on_jamaal_charles_acl857/dm_151012_nfl_adickes_on_jamaal_charles_acl857_default.jpg", "https://w1.buysub.com/pubs/ES/ESN/AR_SplitTest.jsp?cds_mag_code=ESN&addata=2012_MAGNB_COM_ART_SUB_TXT", "http://media.video-cdn.espn.com/motion/2015/1012/dm_151012_nfl_schefter_ray_rice_chiefs/dm_151012_nfl_schefter_ray_rice_chiefs_default.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:14:29.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
