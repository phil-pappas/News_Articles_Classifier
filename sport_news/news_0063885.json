Parking lots full of cars were flooded, as well.\nHe recommends to have flooded cars checked out by a mechanic before trying to drive them.\nMore than 6 inches of rain fell across parts of Maine. New Hampshire saw more than 5 inches, as well. Vermont saw heavy rain, but not as much as that.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
