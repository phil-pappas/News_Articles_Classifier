Dickey will try to get the Blue Jays even in the best-of-seven series Tuesday afternoon. He faces Kansas City's 6-foot-10 right-hander Chris Young in Game 4.\nIn the first ALCS game in Toronto since 1993, Tulowitzki connected for a three-run shot off Johnny Cueto, and Donaldson hit a two-run drive off Kris Medlen as the Blue Jays hit their first home runs of the series.\nCueto failed to retire a batter in the third inning, allowing eight runs and six hits in the worst postseason start of his career.\nPLAYOFFS \nTulo ejected\n(AP) - Blue Jays shortstop Troy Tulowitzki was ejected for arguing with plate umpire John Hirschbeck before the top of the eighth inning.\nTulowitzki was upset after being called out on strikes to begin the bottom of the seventh.
