We will never allow a limit on people's freedom of expression.\" \nBarca, whose motto is \"more than a club\", has long been an outlet for fans who support Catalan independence from Spain to express their beliefs. \nSupporters of the club were criticised by politicians from Spain's ruling People's Party (PP) after they whistled the national anthem at the King's Cup final at the end of May. \nImage: Barcelona's Lionel Messi reacts (Image used for representational purposes) \nPhotograph: Tony Gentile/Reuters Source: Â© Copyright 2015 Reuters Limited.
