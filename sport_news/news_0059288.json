O'Connor was out cold before he hit the mat. \n\"I worked on that punch for six weeks,\" Bracero said after the fight. \"In my last fight, I fought a southpaw and made some mistakes. I specifically worked on that punch because Danny's a southpaw. I slipped to the side and threw the right. This was the first time I went away to camp, away from my family. \n\"I'm just so humbled and grateful. I knew coming in here that all the pressure was on him (O'Connor); the crowd would try to take the beast out of me and put me on the defense. Everything is going to work out (regarding his next fight). I'll let Tommy Gallagher and Lou DiBella take care of my next fight. I'm ready to go right back in the gym.\" \nO'Connor was taken by ambulance to the nearby Lowell General Hospital for observation. \nHometown hero \"Irish\" Micky Ward and National Hockey League Hall-of-Famer Bobby Orr wee in attendance supporting the New England and Irish fighters. NBCSN analyst \"Sugar\" Ray Leonard returned to the same building in which he captured a National Golden Gloves Tournament title in 1973. \nUndefeated Dominican super bantamweight KO artist Jonathan \"Salomon King\" Guzman (20-0, 20 KOs), fighting out of nearby Lawrence (MA), made it a perfect 20 fights, 20 KO wins via a ninth-round stoppage of a game Danny Aquino (17-3, 10 KOs) in the 10-round co-feature. \nGuzman dropped Aquino, a Mexican native fighting out of Connecticut, in the second round. The badly hurt Aquino, however, lasted until the ninth round when Guzman ended the show with a brutal left hook. Aquino, another New England Golden Gloves champion who won his title in this very building, had never been stopped as a professional. \nQuincy (MA) featherweight Ryan \"The Polish Prince\" Kielczweski (24-1, 7 KOs), who won two New England Golden Gloves championships at Lowell Memorial Auditorium, won a 10-round, hard fought decision over Brooklyn's Rafael \"Dynamite\" Vazquez (16-2, 13 KOs). \nKielczweski out boxed Vazquez in the first four rounds, but Vasquez came charging back and opened a cut over Kielczweski's right eye in the eighth and rocked the local fighter in the final 30 seconds of the fight The judges had Kielczweski winning the entertaining fight by scores of 97-93 twice and 96-94.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:20:09.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
