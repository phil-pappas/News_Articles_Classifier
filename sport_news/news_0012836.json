Mill Plain Blvd. at 4:15 a.m. Then the same thing happened at a cell phone store just a few blocks away.\nThat prompted police to begin actively watching cell phone businesses in the area, the department reported.\nSoon, around 5 a.m., Cpl. Chris LeBlanc saw a man running from a strip mall less three miles east of the original break-ins, at Mill Plain and Southeast Chaklov Drive. The man ran to a waiting vehicle. Police stopped it and determined it was stolen.\nThe vehicle sped off, with the man and other people still inside it. Police chose not to pursue it, due to the risk that would pose to the public. They confirmed that another smash-and-grab had taken place at the strip mall cell phone store.\nJust after 7 a.m., police dispatchers took calls that a vehicle was on fire about two miles north of the third break-in, in the 11200 block of Northeast Burton Road. Upon arrival, officers found the stolen vehicle from the earlier incident fully engulfed in flames.\nPolice have no suspects. The fire is being investigated as an arson.\nAnyone with information regarding this case is encouraged to contact the Vancouver police Cpl. Duane Boynton at 360-772-2366.\n-- Betsy Hammond\nbetsyhammond@oregonian.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:17:18.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
