The Jayhawks beat the Wildcats in four sets. Posted: Wednesday, October 14, 2015 7:31 pm Kansas volleyball extends streak to 18-0 in 4-set win over Baylor Amie Just | @Amie_Just kansan.com \nIt wasn't easy, it wasn't pretty, but No. 9 Kansas defeated Baylor in four sets (25-21, 13-25, 25-20, 25-17) to extend its undefeated streak to 18-0. \nKansas (18-0, 6-0 Big 12) dropped just its fifth set of the season in the win over Baylor (13-6, 1-4). Kansas dropped one set each against Arkansas, Northern Colorado, Gonzaga and Kansas State. \n\"Didn't serve well, didn't pass well, and a lot of that has to do with your opponent,\" coach Ray Bechard said in a postgame interview. \"Baylor played a high level match tonight.\" \nSophomore right side hitter Kelsie Payne and sophomore outside hitter Madison Rigdon hammered out 13 kills apiece to lead the Kansas offense. \nSophomore setter and reigning AVCA Player of the Week Ainise Havili notched 34 assists and 13 digs, marking her sixth double-double of the season. \nThe first set was one for the ages. The score was deadlocked 13 times and the lead alternated seven times. Kansas won the set off a long attack attempt from Baylor. \nThe second set was a completely different story. The Jayhawks and the Bears were tied at five at one point, but the Bears took it and never looked back. Baylor ran away with the set, giving Kansas its worst set loss of the season, 13-25. \nAt the break, Bechard said he told the team that Baylor outworked them in the first two sets. \n\"Our team takes that personal when we talk about other people outworking us,\" Bechard said. \"We are committed to having a culture of hard work. They were on our heels the entire time that second set. That's a good wake-up call for our team.\" \nThe third set was slightly reminiscent of the first set, as it was tied seven times throughout, but Kansas powered through to take the two-set lead. Senior outside hitter Tiana Dockery was a main factor in closing out the final points, as she and Janae Hall went up for a block to give Kansas the match point serve. A kill from Dockery sealed the deal, giving the Jayhawks the 2-1 set lead. \nThe fourth set was tighter, but not as close as the first and third. Kansas and Baylor were tied early at nine points apiece, but Kansas charged ahead, winning five of the next six points. Baylor couldn't recover and Kansas ended the set, winning 25-17. \nNext up for the Jayhawks is a home match against the Oklahoma Sooners on Wednesday, Oct. 21 at 6:30 p.m. Kansas will shoot for 19-0 in the game against the Sooners. \nâ€” Edited by Leah Sitz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:01:53.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
