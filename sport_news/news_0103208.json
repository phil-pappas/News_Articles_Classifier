Warmer temperatures slowed bird movement, but ducks began moving at sunrise and the geese began showing at 9 a.m. Piatkowski had his four mallards before 7:45 a.m. and O’Neill’s Zink call was able to pull a few geese from passing flights, enough for his youth to harvest a limit by 10 a.m.\nA Youth Pheasant Hunt is on this weekend and a Youth Firearms Deer Hunt continues this weekend and Monday.\nWalleye university\nOne good option for a holiday gift would be a registration in the Walleye Fishing University to be held Jan. 9 in the Grange Building on the Erie County Fairgrounds in Hamburg.\nJim and Diane Steel, with Innovative Outdoors, have a solid slate of speaker/presenters, and they are adding more ’eye experts to the day’s agenda.\nAn $80 registration includes a T-shirt, continental breakfast and lunch during the programs.
