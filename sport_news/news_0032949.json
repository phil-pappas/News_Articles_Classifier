This decision is not only about a simple law dispute, it is about the defense of Turkey’s homeland,” Perinçek said after the court announced its decision.\nPerinçek, the leader of Turkey’s Vatan Party (VP), said at a celebration of the 82nd anniversary of the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne that it was an “international lie” to classify the mass deaths of Armenians near the end of the World War I as genocide.\nBecause the event took place in Lausanne, Perinçek was allegedly in violation of Swiss anti-racism legislation.\nUpon an official complaint by the Switzerland-Armenia Association, Perinçek was tried and found guilty of racial discrimination in March 2007, and sentenced him to fines and prison time.\nFollowing the punishment, Perinçek lodged a complaint with the ECHR in 2008.\nIn a judgment of Dec. 17, 2013, the ECHR ruled that there had been a violation of Article 10 (freedom of expression) of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Swiss government requested that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:08:09.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
