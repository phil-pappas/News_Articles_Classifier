FLEMING ISLAND 42 PHOTO GALLERY: Westside at Fleming Island Star of the game: Senior RB Trey Sneed ran for 219 yards and five TDs as the Golden Eagles (3-3) celebrated homecoming with a victory over Westside. Turning point: Trailing 35-27 midway through the fourth quarter, Westside’s Tahveon Nicholson could not handle a pitch from QB Amari DuBose, batting the ball forward where the Golden Eagles’ Josh Pierce pounced on it. Seven plays later, Sneed dived across the goal line from three yards out to give the Golden Eagles a comfortable lead. On defense: Aside from Pierce’s crucial recovery, there were few defensive highlights. The teams combined for 1,012 total yards. ... Fleming’s Deon Pate had two tackles for loss, while Pierce, Matt Whetstone and Andrew Brennan had sacks. Fast facts: Sneed, a Rutgers commit, carried 24 times and scored on runs of 9, 24, 3, 13 and 3 yards as Fleming rallied from a 21-14 deficit. ... Nicholson scored twice for the Wolverines (1-6), one running and one receiving. ... DuBose (174 yards rushing) and RB Drevon Eason (115 yards, TD) led Westside offense. ...
