He has won seven straight against Buffalo, including four shutouts.\n\"The worst thing you could do is get comfortable,\" said Luongo, whose 403rd victory tied him with Grant Fuhr for ninth all-time. \"That's when bad things happen. We played good enough to win but we have another gear in this locker room and we have to expect that every night. We'll take the two points.\"\nThanks partly to the schedule-makers as well as a blossoming young team on the upswing the Panthers are 3-1 and have matched their best start since the 2011-12 season which also happens to be the last time they made the playoffs.\nAlso off to a sensational start is Jagr, who has four goals in the first four games. Jagr didn't score his fourth goal last season with the Devils until Nov. 28 in his 23rd game.\nThe Panthers, who scored on their first two power-play chances in the season opener, had converted just 1-of-14 since and none over their past two games. That dubious streak ended at 8:42 of the first period when Aleksander Barkov set up Jagr in front of the right circle for a snapper past goalie Chad Johnson.\nGlass issue at BB&T brings intermission of Sabres-Panthers with 2:53 left in first period Harvey Fialkov Jaromir Jagr scores two first-period goals -- separated by the intermission after glass is dislodged in Sunrise. Jaromir Jagr scores two first-period goals -- separated by the intermission after glass is dislodged in Sunrise. (Harvey Fialkov) \"It was a great pass. I had an empty net. I need like 80 of them,\" laughed Jagr, whose 205th power-play goal tied him with Joe Sakic for 13th place all-time. \"We were more lucky than good. We'll take it, but we have to play better on Saturday to beat Dallas.\"\nIn a bizarre (near) end to the first period, a couple of players crashed into the boards and dislodged a the glass. Instead of waiting for the maintenance crew to repair the glass, the officials resorted to Rule 17:07 and signaled for an early intermission with 2:53 left on the clock.\nWhen the players came out of the dressing room they remained on the same side of the ice, and just 27 seconds into the continued first period, Jagr smoked a riser past Johnson. It was Jagr's 44th goal and 100th point in his 84th game against the Sabres (1-3).\n\"It's not the first time it happened and won't be the last time,\" Jagr said of the interruption. \"It was a strange game, no momentum at all. My legs were so cold if I survive this game I could play six more years.\"\nWhen the 2:53 elapsed the players switched sides, but the Panthers now led 2-0 after one. From there the Panthers seem to doze off, but despite three consecutive power plays the Sabres wouldn't score until they were at even strength at 7:10 when rookie defenseman Jake McCabe crashed the net for his first NHL goal in his 11th game.\nLeading 2-1 after two, Jagr set up the insurance tally on the another power-play goal as his blast off Johnson's pads bounced to Barkov for the rebound at 4:24 of the third.\n\"It's a lot of fun to play with those guys. They can keep the puck, they're skilled, and pass the puck,\" Barkov said. \"I try to do the same thing.\"\nThe Panthers special teams were dominating after killing off Buffalo's first five power-play goals but finally Tyler Ennis' slapper from the point made it 3-2 at 12:35 to create a nervous ending.\n\"Jagr was good again. The power play moved the puck good,\" Panthers coach Gerard Gallant said. \"We took too many penalties tonight. … We got to be more disciplined but overall our special teams were real good and that probably won the game for us.\"\n Ice Hockey Jaromir Jagr Florida Panthers Buffalo Sabres NHL Roberto Luongo Pittsburgh Penguins", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562056b2/turbine/sfl-photos-buffalo-sabres-at-florida-panthers-20151015", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56206004/turbine/fl-florida-panthers-buffalo-sabres-1016-20151015", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56204ba4/turbine/sfl-panthers-glass-early-intermission-sabres-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-16T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:06:08.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
