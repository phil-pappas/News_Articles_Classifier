He wished Murray’s teammates at Warren Hills Regional High School in Washington Township the best and told them to “win one for Evan.” \nAuthorities say the 17-year-old died from massive internal bleeding caused by a lacerated spleen. \nThe funeral for the popular three-sport star and honors student was held Thursday. \nBon Jovi’s son, Jesse Bongiovi, made it onto Notre Dame’s football team as a walk-on in 2013. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:28:12.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
