He’s been at virtually every game I’ve ever played and he coached me for a number of years. \n“He was in hospital at the time and he wasn’t allowed to be released and they wouldn’t let him out for the day. But he made mum sneak him out of the hospital and he came to watch me play.” \nHis mother had to drive his father back to the hospital after the match and it probably saved Bernard from losing a kidney. \n“During the game, I got a kick in the side,” he said. \n“I didn’t think much of it, I was just a bit winded but then I started feeling pretty ill. \n“Then when we were dropping dad back at the hospital afterwards, they said ‘why don’t you drop in as well and get checked out’. \n“They did all the scans and they said can you give us a urine sample and it came out bright red. \n“They found I had a rupture in my kidney. It was pretty frightening at the time. \n“I then had to spend 12 months out of non-contact sports and off the rugby pitch. \n“But such is life I suppose,” added Foley, who has five siblings — two brothers and three sisters. \nFoley, who scored 28 points against England to break Matt Burke’s 17-year-old record for the Australian to have scored the most points in a Test against the English, said he was the bane of his family’s life, save his father’s, when he was a youngster. \n“My dad never played high-level rugby but loved it and played a bit,” said Foley, whose father’s other hobby is to research the family tree going back to their Irish roots. \nFoley, who also spared some of his time to study an Economics degree at Sydney University, does not appreciate the nickname ‘Iceman’. \nThe name was given to him by former Wallaby Nathan Sharpe after he kicked a long range penalty in the final seconds to give his club The NSW Waratahs their first Super Rugby title last year. \nHowever, it is a characteristic that Cheika – whose arrival at the Waratahs in 2013 proved pivotal for Foley as he switched him from fullback to fly-half – believes is one of his geatest qualities. \n“He has a great mentality, and is extremely cool under pressure,” Cheika said.
