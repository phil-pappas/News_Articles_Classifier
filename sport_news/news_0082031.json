A lot of people have compared us to the old APW Gym Wars, which is a great compliment. I have a feeling that we'll keep in growing. It's a great and positive place to be at,” said Hernandez.\nEstablished in May of 2015 by “Maynard Skynard,” EBPW is located at 110 Second Ave S #B9 in Pacheco, California. It’s been home to big names like Gangrel , Jody Kristofferson , Meteoro and Mike Rayne .\n“I began training to be a wrestler back in early 2001, at the time training with Paul Brown. I ended up as a referee until about 2004 or 2005 when I quit in favor of art school. I came back in 2014, training to be a manager, mainly inspired by seeing a lot people that I used to know 10 years ago go to the big time and make it in WWE/NXT and Lucha Underground,” said Hernandez\nCompeting on October 24 are Kaka Meng , Sir Samurai , Aaron Upton, and Scotty Wringer . For Hernandez, this is his character’s debut.\n“The Barón is inspired by Hatian Voodoo, mainly the Gedés spirits, American Southern Hoodoo and a bit of Al Pacino and the Joker, and a Southern preacher,” said Hernandez\nCreating a character involves combining creative performance, developing a persona, fashioning a costume, and staying in character.\n“As far as sport or art or both, I think is beyond that and it's is own animal altogether. It's art, it's sport, it's drama, it's comedy, it's the battle between good and evil, it's satire, it's stuntwork. But most important of all. It's storytelling. A very physical form of storytelling,” said Hernandez\nOver the years, Hernandez has observed many other established and up and coming wrestlers.\n“My favorite local wrestlers and people to watch for include Kaka Meng, Anton Voorhees, Kenny K, Levi Shapiro, Dark Sheik, Leon Ikusa, Thunder Rosa, Brittany Wonder, Nicole Savoy, Shotzi Blackheart, Idris Jackson, Will Cuevas, and the Suburban Commandos,” said Hernandez\nHernandez participated in a fitness challenge to prepare for his role.\n“I'm pretty damn juiced. Hard work is finally paying off, and I get to live out a boyhood dream. Doesn't get much better than that!” said Hernandez", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kakameng4u", "https://twitter.com/gangrel13", "https://twitter.com/jodywarpig", "https://twitter.com/thejackpotscott", "https://twitter.com/sirsamurai", "https://twitter.com/realmikerayne", "http://www.facebook.com/EBPWrestling"], "published": "2015-10-09T04:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:14:36.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
