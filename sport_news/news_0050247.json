On the football field, the bespectacled 17-year-old was known for his hard play and lighthearted song and dance numbers that made teammates laugh. More From KTVZ.COM Deaths mar high school football season \nEarlier this month, one day after the Burke County High School Bears took the field without their beloved No. 71, the Pride of Burke County symphonic band played his favorite songs as part of his funeral service. His tuba rested on the 50-yard line in the school stadium. \nWilliams' death was the fifth of a U.S. high school football player since early September. Another high school football player died just last Friday. \nThe 5-foot-11-inch, 300-pound junior collapsed September 22 shortly after football practice began, CNN affiliate WSB reported. The school trainer performed CPR until an ambulance arrived, according to the station. \nHis death was heart-related, Burke County Coroner Susan Salemi told CNN, declining to elaborate. \nAbout 3 high football deaths a year \nThe number of young athletes whose deaths are related to high school football fluctuates from year to year. \nIn 2014, five high school players died of causes directly related to the sport, such as head and spine injuries, according to a survey by National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research (NCCSIR) at the University of North Carolina. \nAnother six players died of indirect causes: Three were heart-related, one was from heat stroke and two were hypernatremia and water intoxication, the survey found. \n\"Certainly this is not going to be one of the low years,\" said Robert Cantu, medical director for the NCCSIR and a professor at the Boston University School of Medicine. \nThe past decade has seen an average of three fatalities each year directly attributable to high school football, the survey said. \nIn 2013, there were eight deaths directly linked to high school football. \nBetween 2005 and 2014, the deaths of 92 other high school football players were indirectly related to the sport, according to the NCCSIR survey. \n\"These events are incredibly tragic,\" said Dawn Comstock, an associate professor at the University of Colorado School of Public Health. \n\"I would love to never see another high school athlete die while they play their game but the positive benefits of playing sports in terms of lifelong health are greater.\" \nThe benefits, however, will be of little solace to the families and friends of Williams and the other four high school football players who have died this season. \nAndre Smith \nA high school football player in Illinois died Friday October 23 after being injured the day before during a game, according to CNN affiliate WBBM. \nAndre Smith, 17, died of \"blunt force head injuries due to a football accident,\" according to the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office. The senior at Bogan High School hit his head on the final play of the game, walked off the field but later collapsed, the affiliate said. \nAccording to the Illinois High School Association, Smith was the seventh high school football player to die this year nationwide. \n\"As anyone who has participated in athletics knows, there is a risk of injury any time a player steps on the field of play. Football, in particular, has been under the microscope over the last decade, and organizations at all levels of play, including high school, have been taking aggressive steps to try and reduce injury over time,\" the group said in a statement. \nKenney Bui \nKenney Bui, 17, a wide receiver and defensive back for Evergreen High School near Seattle, died October 12 after suffering a traumatic brain injury during a game the previous Friday. \nVideo shows Bui making a hard tackle on a running play and getting back up, CNN affiliate KIRO reported. He was later taken away in an ambulance after taking a hit to the head near the end of the game. \nBui died from blunt force injuries to the head, according to the King County medical examiner's office. â€¹previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:29:49.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
