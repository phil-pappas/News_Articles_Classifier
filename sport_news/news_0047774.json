The Hawks (7-2) put together a second-half defensive effort that held the vertical passing game of Greendale (6-3) to nothing. \nAfter Panthers sophomore quarterback Mitchell Gnadt went 18 for 24 for 241 yards and three touchdowns in the first half, the Hawks held him to two completions in 12 attempts — while picking off three passes — in the second half for just 30 yards. \nDahl intercepted Gnadt on a deflection with 2 minutes 41 seconds left, then got him again with 38 seconds remaining as the Panthers never really got a last-ditch drive going. \n\"He was actually our starting slot back, but due to an injury to our starting corner we had to move him to corner and get him prepped,\" Koch said of Dahl. \nGreendale observers believe that replays — the game was televised in Milwaukee — showed that Dahl's first interception touched the ground. Dahl said otherwise. His second pick was a no-doubter. \n\"Our outside linebacker jammed the outside receivers, so I got to play back and I could just read zone and read the quarterback and what he was going to do,\" Dahl said. \"That let me play better on the ball.\" \nSophomore quarterback Sam Streeter carried the load for Greenfield on offense behind a physical offensive line. \n\"This was definitely won in the trenches,\" said Streeter, who had 18 carries for 80 yards after halftime. \"Our linemen played so hard to open up holes.\" \nThe first five possessions of the first half — three for Greendale, two for Greenfield — went turnover, turnover, turnover, turnover on downs and punt, before the Hawks finally went 48 yards in nine plays. \nFrom there, the teams traded touchdowns to a 21-21 tie at the half. \nThe difference came in the third quarter. \nGreenfield took the kickoff and imposed its will. A 13-play drive featured 12 runs, and Streeter (33 carries, 150 yards) bolted up the middle for a touchdown from 12 yards. \nAnd the Panthers couldn't answer. An unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on coach Rob Stoltz put them in a first-and-25 hole, and Gnadt was intercepted by linebacker Billy Pitroski, who returned it to the Greendale 25. Six running plays later, Streeter had his second touchdown of the half, and the Hawks were up two touchdowns with 2:12 left in the third quarter. \nGreendale answered with an 80-yard drive, but never again had possession on the Greenfield side of the field. \n\"We didn't deserve to win tonight,\" Stoltz said. \"There were a lot of factors. I don't think we were very well-prepared, in general. They out-executed us and out-physicaled us.\" © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
