Yeldon has missed another practice. \nYeldon sat out his fourth consecutive practice Wednesday because of a groin injury. The rookie missed all three workouts last week and did not play in a loss to Houston. Without him, Toby Gerhart and Denard Robinson combined for 45 yards on 16 carries. \nYeldon has 291 yards rushing, 73 yards receiving and a touchdown this season. \nReceiver Marqise Lee (hamstring) and safeties Johnathan Cyprien (calf) and James Sample (shoulder) also missed practice for Jacksonville (1-5), which plays Buffalo (3-3) on Sunday in London. \nRunning back Bernard Pierce returned to practice after spending last week in the NFL's concussion protocol. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:49:22.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
