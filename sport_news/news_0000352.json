(AP) — Seattle Seahawks fullback Derrick Coleman has been arrested and is under investigation of vehicular assault and felony hit-and-run. The team says he has been suspended indefinitely pending further information. \nAccording to jail records, Coleman was booked into King County Jail in Seattle early Thursday and bail was denied. He was arrested by Bellevue police but details were not immediately available. An afternoon news conference is scheduled. \nColeman is in his fourth season with the Seahawks. He spent the 2012 season on the practice squad before making the 53-man roster in 2013. Coleman missed 11 games and the playoffs last season because of a broken foot. \nColeman is legally deaf and his football success has made him an inspirational figure.
