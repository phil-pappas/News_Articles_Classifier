For Belfast, Faith Beaulieu tallied a goal. \nBoth goalies — Mustang Jenni Nadeau (2 saves) and Lion Shera Hilt (6 saves) — played superbly in net. In fact, Hilt followed her 80-minute effort in the varsity game with more time defending the goal during the jayvee contest. \nThe Mustangs finished with 12 shots on goal and seven corner kicks — all taken by Picard. The Lions had four shots on goal and one corner kick. \nThe Mustangs took a 1-0 lead when Arthurs scored, on Picard's assist, with 33:43 left in the opening half. Beaulieu tallied the equalizer with a mere 22 seconds remaining in the same half. \nLord booted in the game-winner on a direct kick from 20 yards out with 19:29 left in the second half. \nMount View had the better of play overall, especially in the first 15 minutes of the second half, when the hosts clanged hard shots off the crossbar and post. \nBelfast also had a few offensive thrusts but could not, in the end, put consistent pressure on the Mustang defense or Nadeau. \nMount View continues to play well and push to host a future prelim playoff game and Thursday's performance helped the 'Stangs take one more step in that direction. \nIn the Maine Principals' Association Heal Point Standings for Class B North, Mount View (5-4) was eighth and Belfast (1-8) 17th. However, that does not include Thursday's outcome. Oceanside of Rockland/Thomaston (8-0-1) is first in the 18-team region. The top 12 teams qualify for the playoffs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:05:24.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
