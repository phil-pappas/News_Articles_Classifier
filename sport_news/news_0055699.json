Here are some numbers from around the area and beyond to warm you up.\n3: Number of punt returns for touchdowns by Northpoint standout Christian Saulsberry, tops among area players. The senior padded his total in last week's 42-7 victory over Amory-Miss., bringing one back 95 yards in the first quarter and another 82 yards in the second as the Trojans built a 35-0 halftime lead. For the season, Saulsberry is averaging 27.8 yards per return.\n3 (again): Total number of quarters played in the last two weeks for St. George's running back Chase Hayden. Don't worry, he's not injured or in trouble. He's just been extremely productive against some overmatched competition. In a 49-0 victory over Rossville on Sept. 18, he gained 171 yards on just four first-quarter carries, scoring on runs of 41, 30 and 80 yards. The junior made it to halftime last week against Fairley but still racked up 244 yards on 14 carries while scoring on runs of 55 and 43 in a 54-8 victory. That adds up to 415 yards on 18 carries with five TDs in 36 minutes of play.\n3 (one more time): Heading into the seventh week of the regular season, there are only three undefeated teams: Cordova, Munford and Northpoint. Munford (5-0) will have the best chance of staying that way as it hosts a one-win Bolton team in Region 8-5A play. Northpoint and Cordova will have it much tougher; the Trojans (6-0) take on a very good Lausanne team while the Wolves (6-0) host arch-rival Arlington in a match-up of teams ranked fifth and 11th respectively in this week's Dandy Dozen.\n5: On the other side of the coin, there are five teams that went into the week still searching for their first victory. The five -- BTW, Kingsbury, Oakhaven, MLK Prep and Sheffield -- are a combined 0-30. It's not looking good for Sheffield, which will finish the year with games against region foes Melrose, Hamilton, Raleigh-Egypt and Covington. And MLK Prep will be hard-pressed to find a victory with Douglass, Hillcrest, East and Bolivar Central remaining. BTW has a winnable game against Northside on Oct. 10. And Kingsbury and Oakhaven fans take note; your teams meet in the regular-season finale on Oct. 30.\n9: There probably aren't two teams in the area that know one another better than White Station and Whitehaven. Counting playoffs, the two have met nine times since 2010. Whitehaven has won eight of those contests with the lone Spartans' victory coming in the second round of the 6A playoffs in 2013. The teams renew acquaintances Friday at Whitehaven.\n44: With a ground-oriented attack designed to take time off the clock, Collierville is not a team that's normally going to light up the scoreboard. Which makes the Dragons' performance in last week's win over Arlington all the more impressive. The 44 points scored in their 14-point victory are the most by a Collierville team since Sept. 13, 2013, when the Dragons defeated Cordova 50-16 -- a span of 23 contests.\n118.4: You may remember Cedrick Wilson as a strong-armed quarterback for White Station who won the Pepsi Best of the Preps offensive player of the year award in 2013. Wilson is now at Coffeyville (Kan.) Junior College and he's transitioning quite well to a new position, averaging 118.4 receiving yards per game. Through five games -- all Coffeyville victories -- he's caught 33 passes for 592 yards and nine touchdowns.\n273: Ridgeway will get to see one of the South's top programs when it makes the 273-mile journey south to take on West Monroe (La.) High. The Rebels have won eight state championships since 1993 and were crowned national champions in 1998 and 2000. That 1998 squad produced five players that signed with LSU and had 12 D-1 players in total, headed by former Dallas Cowboy linebacker Brady James. The Ridgeway-West Monroe connection? Roadrunners principal Dr. Jon Stencel was an assistant on that 1998 team.\n2003: It could be a long Friday night for St. Benedict. The Eagles will open Division 2-AA West Region play against a visiting MUS team that is coming off consecutive losses to South Panola and Ridgeway. The Owls haven't loss three straight since 2003, when they fell to Brentwood Academy, Montgomery Bell Academy, CBHS and Chattanooga McCallie to close out a dismal 4-7 campaign.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:39:54.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
