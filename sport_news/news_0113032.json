United head to the capital of Mother Russia to take CSKA Moscow to continue group stage play in the UEFA Champions League. \nLouis van Gaal has indicated that he won’t change much from Sunday when he selects the Manchester United first team Wednesday night (here’s more on that). \nGiven how the win at Goodison Park was as impressive an effort as we’ve seen all season long, Van Gaal shouldn’t make a whole lot of changes. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it, right? \nSo here’s the Man United starting XI that we’re going with. Anthony Martial Ander Herrera Wayne Rooney Juan Mata Bastian Schweinsteiger Morgan Schneiderlin Marcos Rojo Phil Jones Chris Smalling Matteo Darmian De Gea \nAs always, feel free to post your own Manchester United starting XI projection in the comments section below.
