Thailand is the next most popular boules-playing nation with 40,000 members, while Japan has 10,000.\nEmploying the slogan 'same sport, several disciplines, one candidate' boules is hoping to get on the roster of an Olympics that could be held in Paris - the French capital is bidding to host the summer Games in nine years time.\nAlso in the race to stage the 2024 Games are Budapest, Hamburg, Los Angeles, and Rome.\n'Boules sport' comprises three disciplines - petanque, boule lyonnaise, and rafle.\nFrance has predictably won the last ten editions of the petanque world championships, a run dating back to 2001.\nBut Belgium, Algeria and Madagascar have also claimed petanque's ultimate prize.\nPetanque, often seen as a recreational game for the older generation, with matches a feature of rural French life at weekends, involves throwing a metal ball from a circle on a flat dirt or gravel track and trying to land as close as possible to the wooden jack.\nThe 2012 world championships in Marseille brought together more than 10,000 competitors from 20 countries, with some 150,000 spectators.\nThe game is not without danger.\nIn 2013 an 84-year-old petanque-playing pensioner was crushed to death by a two tonne elephant called Tanya that had escaped from a circus in a village near Paris.\nAnd in 2008 a French player was fatally struck on the head by an opponent's ball near the Catholic shrine of Lourdes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:40:54.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
