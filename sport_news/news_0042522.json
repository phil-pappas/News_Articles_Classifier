Custom-fit options are tailored precisely to the vehicle application. Car Covers\nAutoBody Armor Custom Car Covers offer maximum protection for indoor and outdoor use. The covers create a strong barrier against water, UV rays, dirt, dust, and other pollutants—both natural and man-made. They’re made from breathable fabric to eliminate condensation build up under the cover. AutoBody Armor covers feature three layers of material double-stitched with waxed thread to virtually eliminate leaks. Neoprene elastic tensioners in front and rear hold the covers firmly in place.\nAs the name implies, Coverking Coverbond-4 Custom Car Covers feature four layers of fabric to provide excellent protection against nicks and scratches. The additional layers also do an excellent job blocking sunlight and guarding against weather damage. The covers’ durability makes them an excellent option for long-term storage.\nSeat Covers\nCoverking Seat Covers are custom-matched to the applications and available in a wide range of colors—including a nifty camo-print for outdoorsy-types. You can get them for front, rear, and third row seats.\nHate hot, sticky seats? Coverking Spacer Mesh Custom Seat Covers have extremely porous fabric to wick away moisture and stay cool. They’re available in bold, two-tone colors and install with a factory-snug fit. These covers are an excellent option for warm-weather climates.\nCordura Ballistic Custom Seat Covers are a great fit for interiors that see a lot of use. The covers’ 1680 denier water resistant Cordura fiber will withstand abuse. They’re UV treated to resist mildew and stains, and the tightly woven design creates a slick carbon-fiber look. Cordura Ballistic custom seat covers are easy to clean and maintain.\nSummit Racing Equipment\nhttp://www.SummitRacing.com\n1-800-230-3030", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zdW1taXRyYWNpbmcuY29tL3NlYXJjaC9icmFuZC9jb3Zlcmtpbmc/c29ydGJ5PURlZmF1bHQmc29ydG9yZGVyPUFzY2VuZGluZyZrZXl3b3JkPUNvdmVya2luZyZrcj1Db3Zlcmtpbmc=", "http://www.prweb.net/Redirect.aspx?id=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5TdW1taXRSYWNpbmcuY29t"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:52:08.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
