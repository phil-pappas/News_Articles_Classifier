Walker, a beloved art professor at Georgia Southern University for 27 years, every canvas was always full of possibility.\nThis late artist serves as the subject of a posthumous exhibit at Indigo Sky Community Gallery, featuring original paintings, pastels, drawings and photography created over the course of four decades. “Patricia J. Walker: Works From the Studio” reveals the artist’s keen eye and disciplined approach to mark making. All proceeds benefit the Pat Walker Scholarship in Painting, which will provide financial support for painting students at Georgia Southern University.\nCurated by Walker’s husband, John Mitchell, and her former student, Susan Huelsiewche, this show offers insight into this talented artist’s creative process, from her lifelong fascination with color to her bold experimentation with a wide range of media.\n“She had such courage,” Mitchell explains. “She had great trust in the process. She knew that every painting had to have a life of its own.”\nMore than 40 works from various stages of Walker’s career grace the walls of Indigo Sky Community Gallery. Attracted to natural forms, she found herself captivated by the texture of vines, bark, leaves and tidal creeks and relished the opportunity to paint outdoors on Ossabaw Island, Sapelo Island and Isle of Hope.\n“Simply making a copy of scenery does not motivate me,” she wrote in her final artist statement in 2012. “My interest lies in compositionally rearranging the forms found on these islands in an attempt to create a metaphor for the sensations that are present as I work. The wind blowing by, the taste of sea salt, the cool depth of shadows, my apprehension in the forest and the intrinsic spiritual impact present in nature are transformed into marks and color.”\nFrom the sensual, rippling forms of “Winged Flight” to the sizzling summery hues of “Late August,” Walker celebrates the mutable charms of the natural world. Highlights include dramatic large-format pastels, intimate still lifes, early figurative portraits and Ossabaw Island-inspired nature scenes. A 1978 charcoal self-portrait, one of the earliest works on display, depicts the artist peering back at the viewer from behind oversized spectacles.\nAbstract pastels like “Vine Abstraction” and “Rainy Afternoon” demonstrate Walker’s mastery of form and color and the way she used nature to explore deeper emotional subjects and psychological states. “Moonlight in the Maritime Forest,” a haunting black matte painting with silver vines winding gracefully across the surface of the composition, takes that impulse a step further, evoking a dark night that doubles as a spiritual metaphor.\nA formalist at heart, Walker’s large-format oil painting titled “The White Way” uses thick impasto texture laced with hints of green, mauve and amber to stimulate the eye. “Still Life in Red” vibrates with nearly a dozen shades of cherry, crimson and ruby, underscoring the artist’s focus on hue values and her interest in color variations to achieve different visual effects.\nElsie Hill, a colleague of Walker’s at Georgia Southern University, remembers her former mentor as a remarkably talented artist and dedicated professor.\n“She was very concerned with students understanding that you have to make a bad painting to make a good painting,” Hill says. “She felt that you have to be able to use the whole palette. She taught her students that every single color in the spectrum is important.”\nWalker lost her battle with cancer earlier this year, but her passion for art lives on in this impressive retrospective and in the endowed scholarship created in her memory.\nABOUT THE ARTIST\nPatricia J. Walker (1949-2015) was a professor emeritus of painting at Georgia Southern University’s Betty Foy Sanders Department of Art. She earned a BFA in Painting from the Rhode Island School of Design and an MFA in Painting from Cornell University. An accomplished figurative artist who turned her attention to nature in the latter part in her career, Walker exhibited her work extensively and was featured in shows in California, New York, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Massachusetts.\nIF YOU GO\nWhat: “Patricia J.
