Green attracting much of the Buffalo Bills ' attention, Bengals receiver Marvin Jones made a suggestion to quarterback Andy Dalton to open the third quarter.\n\"I told Andy to just throw it because I'm go to run and get it,\" Jones said, referring to his 42-yard, over-the-shoulder catch that eventually set up his 10-yard touchdown on the Bengals' opening drive of the second half.\n\"If you're going to take away one person, we've got six, seven other people that can do the job. And it went my way.\"\nThe Bengals (6-0) and their multi-threat offense continued to roll in a 34-21 win on Sunday in which they matched the team's best start to a season in franchise history.\nWith Green covered, Dalton turned his attention elsewhere in throwing touchdown passes to Jones, Tyler Eifert and Jeremy Hill .\nGiovani Bernard also scored on a 17-yard run in a game the Bengals blew open by scoring 17 points on their first three drives of the second half.\nDalton went 22-for-33 for 243 yards, and Jones took advantage of one-on-one coverage with a team-leading and career-best nine catches and 95 yards.\nThe Bengals, who enter their bye week before traveling to play at Pittsburgh on Nov. 1, were also 6-0 to start the 1975 and '88 seasons.\nBills coach Rex Ryan found out the hard way how difficult it is defending the Bengals.\n\"You take away this guy, you take away that guy,\" Ryan said. \"Well, this other dude beats you.\"\nThe Bills (3-3) were in no position to keep up because of a banged-up offense and tiring defense in losing their third consecutive home game.\nAnd now they're flying to London for a game against Jacksonville next week not knowing who'll be healthy enough to play.\nReceiver Sammy Watkins hurt his left ankle while making a 22-yard touchdown catch, and was spotted walking with a cane in the locker room. Defensive tackle Kyle Williams was carted off the field with a left knee injury. And starting quarterback Tyrod Taylor's status remains uncertain after being sidelined with a sprained left knee.\nEJ Manuel started in Taylor's place and finished 28-for-42 for 263 yards with a touchdown and interception in his first start in a little more than a year.\nBills general manager Doug Whaley said the injuries coupled with traveling overseas makes it even more complex for him in scrambling to add players.\nThe first concern is making sure any new additions have a passport.\n\"It's going to put us in a bind. We're going to go straight to work on that now,\" Whaley told The Associated Press as he and the team prepared to fly out immediately after the game.\n\"It narrows your pool down because some guys don't have passports. And the pool's already reduced because it's the middle of the season and everybody's trying to add guys.\"\nAt least running back LeSean McCoy , who scored on a 4-yard run, returned after missing two games with a pulled left hamstring. Receiver Percy Harvin , however, didn't play because of a hip injury, and receiver Marquise Goodwin didn't return after hurting his ribs.\n\"You know (injuries) are going to happen,\" Bills linebacker Nigel Bradham said. \"But when it's that many of them, it's tough on you.\"", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/51/8813122/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/51/8813128/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/51/8813128/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/51/8813125/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/51/8813127/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/51/8813123/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/51/8813124/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/51/8813125/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/51/8813123/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/51/8813126/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/51/8813127/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/51/8813122/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/51/8813124/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/51/8813126/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T05:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:50:02.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
