Here are a few highlights:\nOn an early bye week:\n\"The thing about this time of year is that it's kind of like getting in the car and taking a long, eight- or nine0hour trip, and after 30 minutes the kids say they need to use the bathroom. That's what an open date is this early in the season. You get going and the next thing you know, you're stopping and then get going again.\"\nOn Rice and coach David Bailiff:\n\"The job that David Bailiff has done there over the last nine years is borderline phenomenal. I think they won their first conference championship a few years ago for the first time in 55 or 56 years; just a tremendous job by a tremendous person. I've known David for many, many years as a Texas high school coach and a Texas high school player and a native Texas like myself. He's a guy that I have a whole lot of respect for.\"\nOn what to improve on during the bye week:\n\"There are so many things to polish off, I don't really know where to start. It starts with coaching, we have to coach better, we have to be better situationally on both sides of the ball. Special teams have been okay, a couple times we've had a punt roll to the one, we've fielded a punt at the seven in the first game, so we've had a couple of things in that area. We have to be cleaner.\"\nOn injuries:\n\"Devin Chafin pulled a little bit of a hamstring against Lamar. I think he's probable at best for this weekend. Taylor Young should be back, that'll help spark this defense a little bit. He's a great leader, great inspirer, he's a guy that really makes plays instinctively, and I think that's about it. I think we've been very fortunate up to this point.\"\nOn Chris Johnson at tight end with Tre'Von Armstead off the team:\n\"There have been a lot of talks and I think you could possibly see him lined up there this weekend in a couple of formations.\"\nOn Tre'Von Armstead being out:\n\"No comment on that, but as far as what it does to us as a football team, that's why you've got 85 scholarships. We've got guys that can play, we have guys that we feel really good about at that position.\"\nOn owning the nation's longest home winning streak:\n\"Honestly, I did not know that. I remember the last one that wasn't a win, quite easily. So when you coach, you usually remember the bad and not the good, but that's a good thing. It's impressive and I think it says a lot about who we are as a fan base, how we play as a team, and how we protect our turf. That's all good, but I think that just shows you how hard it is to consistently win.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @ShehanJeyarajah", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ShehanJeyarajah"], "published": "2015-09-22T00:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:47:04.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
