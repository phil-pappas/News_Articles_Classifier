(AP) - Dillon Powers and Marcelo Sarvas scored late goals and the Colorado Rapids beat Sporting Kansas City 2-0 on Wednesday night for their first road victory in the series since 2002.\nPowers chipped goalkeeper Tim Melia at the end of a counter attack in the 78th minute and, after Colorado was reduced to 10 men, Sarvas powered in a shot on another breakaway in the 86th.\nColorado (9-14-10) snapped a six-game winless streak, which included four straight losses. Sporting KC (13-11-9) needs to beat Los Angeles on Sunday to secure a playoff spot.\nZac MacMath made his second start of the season for Colorado and got his first shutout. Sam Cronin picked up his second yellow card in the 84th on a high challenge of Jordi Quintilla.\nSporting KC's best scoring chance came when Dominic Dwyer played a through ball inside the box in the 71st, but Graham Zusi's shot hit off the crossbar. Two minutes later, MacMath made a kick save of Soni Mustivar's deflected shot.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
