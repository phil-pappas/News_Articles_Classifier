New Zealand's World Cup-winning coach Graham Henry helped Argentina rediscover theirs in 2012. \nHenry used his consultancy stint to tell the Pumas to be themselves. Hourcade and company have never looked back. \nCubelli shares half-back duties with Landajo, and in terms of personality the two could hardly be more apposite. \nWhere Cubelli keeps counsel and stays quiet, Landajo seeks company and cracks jokes. \nEach nine is just as important as the other to the Pumas, and despite their different characteristics, Cubelli admitted they remain firm friends. \n\"He is a funny guy, very sharp,\" said Cubelli of the 27-year-old Landajo. \n\"Maybe I'm a little bit more serious, a bit more shy. \n\"I also like to joke a little bit, but a little bit more shy. \n\"I've shared a lot of squads with Martin, not only the Pumas, the Pampas XV and the Jaguars. \n\"We've played a lot of tournaments together, and even across a whole tournament we would play one game each. \n\"It's a special rivalry for me. It's a pleasure to share and to fight for a jersey with another player. \n\"It makes you sure that you are always at the top of your game, and that's very good. \n\"It's always up to the coach of course, this position. \n\"But it's great for me to compete with Martin.\" \nCubelli believes Argentina's family spirit stems from the game's amateur roots. \n\"Yes we are lucky to have great rugby players, but we are even more lucky to have great friends and great people,\" said Cubelli. \n\"It maybe comes with the way we are educated in our clubs in Argentina. \n\"Rugby in Argentina is amateur, first of all in most of the clubs you are educated as a good person, a good team-mate, and afterwards as a good player. \n\"Because sometimes we don't have the structures, all the coaches study the game of course but at some points we don't have the resources at that level. \n\"We might not have fantastic resources but we have great human resources, that's what we have and we have to do that well. \n\"If we don't have that then we can't compete.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:19:02.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
