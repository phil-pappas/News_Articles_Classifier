The Salukis converted a field goal with 5:38 to go to take a 36-34 lead and after a Trenton Norvell interception, the game looked lost. But the WIU defense held SIU to three and out, getting the offense one last shot with 1:42 to go. \"You can't score unless you get the ball back and we knew we somehow had to get the ball back to our offense,\" WIU linebacker Brett Taylor said. \"We got it back and they did a great job setting it up for Nate who made a big kick to get us a great 'W.' ‘’ The Leathernecks started at their own 31 and after a pair of Nikko Watson runs, WIU was at its own 42. That's when Norvell found Lance Lenoir Jr. on the sideline for a 44-yard pitch and catch to the Saluki 14. \"I was running down the side and Trent threw it to my back shoulder,\" Lenoir said. \"I had to slow down and the DB (defensive back) went by and I was able to get it and get extra yards after the catch.\" From there it was all about setting it up for Knuffman and the win. \"I knew we would get down there in field goal range, so I had to get prepared because that's my job,\" Knuffman said. \"It felt pretty good (the kick), not being able to practice this week due to a hamstring tweek, it felt good to get back on the field. Once the snap was down, I knew I was going to make it.\" The Leathernecks started the game quickly on their first drive. After forcing a Saluki punt, the Leathernecks went 60 yards on four plays, capped by a Watson 27-yard run. The drive was just the start of Watson's big day, as he ran for a career-high 174 yards. \"We kind of had a slow start against Coastal Carolina so we knew we had to put a good drive together,\" Watson said. \"We knew we had to score on the first drive and get the momentum turned our way.\" Page 2 of 2 - WIU would lead 14-6 on a Taylor Hill touchdown reception from Norvell but the Salukis would strike back, getting a touchdown pass and returning a blocked punt for a touchdown, taking a 20-14 lead at halftime. The lead would not last long into the second half as a Watson one-yard touchdown run and a Norvell 53-yard pass to Stacey Smith Jr. put WIU ahead 28-20. \"There were two critical things in the game, first we came out in the third quarter after giving up the punt block touchdown and gave them all the momentum into halftime, we knew we'd get the ball first, so we had a nice drive, then followed that up with a stop and a scoring one-play drive,\" Nielson said. \"That put the momentum back on our side and gave us confidence.\" After SIU would retake the lead on a 25-yard touchdown run and a 70-yard interception return for a score, the second big series of the half would occur. Safety Aaron Diggs would knock the ball from a Saluki running back. Taylor would pick the ball up and run 21 yards for a score, giving the Leathernecks a 34-33 lead. \"The other big play, right after we give up a turnover and touchdown, we did not do anything, then our defense generates a turnover for a touchdown,\" Nielson said. \"It was good to see our defense make that kind of play and get us going back in the right direction. \" The return was the second touchdown of the season for Taylor. \"My eyes got super, super big, I did not see anyone around, so I picked it up,\" Taylor said. \"All the credit goes to Aaron Diggs for causing the fumble.\" Reach Scott Holland via email at sholland@McDonoughVoice.com and follow him on Twitter @hottscolland81.
