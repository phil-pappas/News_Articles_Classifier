Although one loss was at undefeated Ramsey, the Cardinals hope their most recent game, a 2-0 loss to Lakeland, does not impede their momentum. Six different players have scored goals and six different players have assisted on goals for the Cardinals, led by Valona Toska (four goals) and Harlee York (six assists).\nWayne Hills has won the past two county titles. Amanda LaGuardia leads the team with 20 goals and has emerged as one of the area’s most prolific scorers. The key matchup will be LaGuardia against the Cardinals’ defense in what probably will be a defensive battle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:48:24.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
