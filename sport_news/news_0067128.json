(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) — Charlie Riedel \nThe Bears' 18-17 victory over the Chiefs on Sunday was the first time this season the majority of Bears players on both sides of the ball graded out above average. \nIt all starts with Jay Cutler. \nAll Bears fans want at this point is a serviceable game manager but Cutler made at least four throws in Kansas City that only the elite guys make. \nThe two touchdown passes were gorgeous. \nBut Cutler’s second best throw of the day was from his own 40 with 5:33 left in the third quarter, the 33-yard rope he threw to Marquess Wilson. \nAaron Rodgers, Ben Roethlisberger and Philip Rivers are the only three other quarterbacks in the league who can make that throw. \nThe throw of the day though was an incompletion, the 25-yard dart he put on Martellus Bennett’s hands between tight double coverage with 1:16 left in the game. \nIt would have been a nice catch by Bennett but one he should have made, and Rodgers is the only other guy in the league who can make that throw. \nCutler was an A- on the day, the minus because even though the pressure was immediate he can’t fumble that football in the end zone. \nRunning backs were a B with Matt Forte solid all day and huge on the game-winning touchdown, and Jeremy Langford fitting right in after Jacquizz Rodgers was lost for the season with a broken arm. \nThe Bears should however keep an eye on Forte’s average per carry declining weekly. \nReceivers were better than average but still just a B-. \nBennett had his toughest day of the season with only four catches on 11 targets. And while Marquess Wilson had two big plays on the 33-yarder and the first touchdown, Cutler’s 57.7 percent completion percentage and 5.6 average in the game are sub-par and mainly because he doesn’t have enough open targets. \nCameron Meredith was the best receiver on the day but clearly benefited from the Chiefs focus on Bennett and Forte. \nOn the offensive line Kyle Long was an A and the group a B-. \nJustin Houston is an absolute killer and paired up with him most of the day, Long was the winner showing why he’s one of the best offensive linemen in the game. \nHroniss Grasu had a really rough start but settled down nicely and was a C+, maybe even a B-. \nCharles Leno Jr. was a B- as well, not spectacular but solid most of the time. \nIt took him about a quarter to get comfortable, but the impact of Jeremiah Ratliff on the defense is clear as he took 37 of the 58 defensive snaps and finally gave the Bears someone up front who required occasional double teams. \nLamarr Houston had his most productive game of the season with just 14 snaps to Willie Young’s 19 but each notched their first sacks of the season as the defense kept coming on in the second half. \nPernell McPhee was occasionally dominant for the second week in a row and Sam Acho was the best player on the field for either defense. \nThe front seven was a B, with Acho, McPhee and Ratliff all rating B+. \nTracy Porter would have been an A were it not for what he himself called a “rookie mistake” on the Chiefs only offensive touchdown. \nThe entire secondary was solid, limiting Kansas City to 170 net passing yards after they threw for 251 and 348 the last two weeks at Green Bay and Cincinnati, albeit a lot of it in garbage time. \nThe DB’s were a B as a group. \nEven special teams were at their best this season earning a B with Robbie Gould still perfect on field goals, Patrick O’Donnell back from a knee strain with 43.7 net on five punts, McPhee’s blocked field goal attempt and the dangerous Chiefs return game limited to nothing over 19 yards on kick returns or 10 yards on punts. \nAs long as they keep plugging in parts they may be finding on eBay at this point and winning with them, the coaches and front office are worthy of A’s. \n• Chicago Football editor Hub Arkush can be reached at harkush@chicagofootball.com and on Twitter @Hub_Arkush.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:11:17.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
