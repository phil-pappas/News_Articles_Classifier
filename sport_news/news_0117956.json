Ask the experts! \nPISCATAWAY, N.J. -- The Ohio State defense came within 13 seconds on Saturday night at Rutgers of throwing its second shutout of the season before settling for a 49-7 victory.\nAll-America defensive end Joey Bosa said it was “upsetting” to come that close as the backups gave up a 10-play, 90-yard drive for the score.\n“But overall we played a really good game, I thought,” Bosa said.\nThe Buckeyes held an offense that had scored 55 in a win at Indiana the week before not only to just seven points but also to 293 total yards. Having been run on with varying degrees of success in the previous four games, the Buckeyes gave up just 104 yards rushing to Rutgers.\n>> Get the most out of your Ohio State experience, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \nThe Scarlet Knights did drive down the field proficiently on their first possession, but after 64 yards wound up seeing a 29-yard field-goal attempt by Kyle Federico doink off the left upright. Bosa said the defense wasn’t overly concerned.\n“I just think the first series you’ve got to get out of your system,” Bosa said. “You go out there, you’re a little tense, a little nervous. You get it out of your system, you relax. I think our defense has done a really good job of just staying relax and keeping a really good positive attitude.”\nTake that first drive and last drive away from the Scarlet Knights, and they had 139 yards through the guts of the game.\nNow eight games in and still unbeaten, riding a 21-game winning streak, the longest in the nation, the Buckeyes have a bye this week.
