They have topped 30 points in each game since a season-opening loss to Northwestern thanks to their efficient quarterback and all-purpose star. \nMcCaffrey, who entered the game with an FBS-best 253 all-purpose yards per game, had a 50-yard touchdown catch and 7-yard scoring run in the third quarter. In all, he ran 23 times for 109 yards, caught five passes for a career-high 112 yards and added 79 yards on kick returns in his third 300-yard all-purpose game of the season. \nThe Huskies (3-4, 1-3) were no match for the Cardinal, especially with starting quarterback Jake Browning watching with an injury. Backup K.J. Carta-Samuels completed just 9 of 21 passes for 118 yards as Washington didn't even cross midfield until the third quarter. \nThe one bright spot for the Huskies was freshman running back Myles Gaskin, who ran for 108 yards and a score for his third straight 100-yard game. Gaskin ran five times for 57 yards on the opening drive of the third quarter to cut Stanford's lead to 17-7. \nMcCaffrey took over from there. He sneaked out of the backfield on the next drive and hauled in a deep pass from Hogan before outrunning the defense for the touchdown. He then iced the game with his TD run to cap the next drive, making it 31-7. \nThe matchup between the Pac-12's top offense and top defense was one-sided from the start. Stanford took the opening kickoff and drive 62 yards in six plays for the score on Hogan's 21-yard pass to Austin Hooper. \nThe Huskies struggled to move the ball with Carta-Samuels getting his first career start in place of the injured Browning, who appeared to hurt his right shoulder late in last week's loss to Oregon. \nCarta-Samuels, who had three career pass attempts coming into the game, was frequently off-target and could not even make the easy completions. The Huskies had just two first downs and 58 yards in the first half and never stood a chance. \nThe Cardinal methodically moved the ball downfield on their third drive, going 90 yards on 15 plays capped by Remound Wright's 1-yard dive. \nA late 28-yard field goal by Conrad Ukropina made it 17-0 at the break. \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T08:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:42:09.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
