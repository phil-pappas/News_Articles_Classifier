But when the Fighting Irish counterpunched, the Trojans crumpled.\nNotre Dame put together back-to-back 90-plus-yard touchdown drives in the fourth quarter to put away USC on Saturday night at Notre Dame Stadium. The final was 41-31 – USC’s second consecutive loss and third in its past four games.\nThe defeat dropped USC – picked in the preseason to finish in the top 10 and win the Pac-12 Conference – to 3-3. No. 14 Notre Dame improved to 6-1.\nUSC was playing for the first time since 2013 under someone other than Steve Sarkisian. The school fired the troubled coach Monday.\nThe Trojans rallied from a 24-10 second-quarter deficit to take a 31-24 lead in the third quarter. But USC’s leaky defense couldn’t hold it. C.J. Prosise (19 carries, 143 yards) capped a nine-play, 90-yard drive with a 6-yard touchdown run to tie the score at 31.\nAfter stopping the Trojans on the next series, the Irish drove 91 yards. Quarterback DeShone Kizer connected with Corey Robinson for a 10-yard touchdown with 9:06 remaining to give Notre Dame the lead.\nUSC had plenty of time to rally again, but Notre Dame’s KeiVarae Russell made a brilliant interception on a deep pass from Cody Kessler for JuJu Smith-Schuster. After a field goal made it 41-31, the Irish picked off Kessler again – safety Max Redfield, a former USC commit from Mission Viejo High, grabbing a pass that deflected off Smith-Schuster.\n“At the end of the day, mistakes hurt us,” Helton said.\nKessler finished 30 of 46 for 364 yards with two touchdowns and the two interceptions. Smith-Schuster caught six passes for 139 yards and one touchdown.\nKizer was 15 of 24 for 227 yards and two touchdowns passing and ran for 47 yards on 14 carries. Notre Dame’s Will Fuller caught three passes for 131 yards, including a 75-yard touchdown for Notre Dame’s first points.\nIt only gets harder for USC from here. No. 4 Utah visits the Coliseum next Saturday.\nContact the writer: mlev@ocregister.com\nRelated: USC-Notre Dame box score", "external_links": ["http://sports.ocregister.com/cfb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=201510170104&home=104&vis=62"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:25:24.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
