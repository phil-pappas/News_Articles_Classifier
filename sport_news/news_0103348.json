Kevin is still an important part of our team.\"\nCarter suffered the season-ending injury on a rushing attempt in a 35-13 victory over West Catholic on Sept. 18.\n \"I was planting my foot to change direction, and I felt a pop inside my knee,\" he said.\nThe senior underwent surgery five days later at Bryn Mawr Hospital. He is set to undergo therapy four days a week.\n\"It was real tough to handle at first,\" Carter said. \"But a day or two after it happened, I stopped dwelling on it. When you play football, you know there's a chance of being injured.\"\nLast season, the dual-threat quarterback threw for 1,531 yards and 16 touchdowns while leading the Fords to a 9-1 overall record and, with a 5-0 mark, an outright Inter-Ac League title.\nAs Haverford (6-0 overall, 1-0 league) prepares for a Saturday afternoon Inter-Ac showdown at Malvern Prep (5-1, 1-0), Carter and Toal regularly talk about the game plan.\nIn last week's league opener against Penn Charter, Toal and Carter, now on crutches, discussed strategy on the sideline. Down by 16-0, the host Fords rallied to beat the Quakers, 41-40, in triple overtime.\n\"I'm trying to help Tommy as much as I can,\" Carter said. \"This week, I'm letting him know about Malvern's tendencies.\"\nSince he's back at school, Carter plans to sit in with Toal on film sessions. \"Even though he can't be out there, he still wants the best for me and the team,\" Toal said.\nIn four appearances, Toal has connected on 52 of 86 throws for 691 yards and eight touchdowns. The 6-foot, 180-pounder has carried 34 times for 104 yards and four scores. \"I don't think there's any drop-off with Tommy in there,\" Carter said.\nIn baseball, Toal is a Division I prospect as an infielder. In the spring the switch-hitting third baseman helped lead the Fords to a 25-5 mark.Carter, who played against Toal in youth baseball, is hearing from Delaware State, Dickinson, Rhode Island, and Trinity. With an eye toward being a journalist, he plans to major in English or communications.\nrobrien@phillynews.com\n@ozoneinq\nwww.philly.com/ozone", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:12:51.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
