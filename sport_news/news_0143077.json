Matthew Paschall, Oregon City Police Department spokesman, said a woman entered the Wilco Farm Store , located at 19224 Molalla Ave ., around 8:30 a.m. Friday and tried on a pair of Bogs -brand boots. The store's surveillance video shows the woman trying on the boots, then putting her own shoes into her purse. She then left the store, wearing the boots.\n\"It's very odd,\" Paschall said. \"She doesn't look much like the typical shoplifter. She looks more like a soccer mom â€“ or a soccer grandma, even.\"\nPaschall said the surveillance videos captured images of the woman leaving the store with the boots and also show her leaving he parking lot in a newer, tan-colored SUV.\nThe woman is described as having shoulder-length blonde hair and wearing glasses.\nPaschall urged anyone with information on the woman, the incident or her vehicle to call the Oregon City Police Department's tip line at 503-496-1616.\n-- Rick Bella rbella@oregonian.com\n503-294-5915; @southnewshound", "external_links": ["http://www.orcity.org/police", "https://www.google.com/maps/place/19224+Molalla+Ave,+Oregon+City,+OR+97045/@45.3285161,-122.590613,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x549570c7d749ff5d:0xf6f49dea7632b5ac", "http://www.bogsfootwear.com/shop/index.html", "http://www.wilco.coop/", "https://twitter.com/southnewshound", "https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d11220.02107205488!2d-122.59061304946377!3d45.32851607909959!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x549570c7d749ff5d%3A0xf6f49dea7632b5ac!2s19224+Molalla+Ave%2C+Oregon+City%2C+OR+97045!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1445361066783"], "published": "2015-10-20T18:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:58:34.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
