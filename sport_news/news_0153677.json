The series turned, ironically on Boston's winning goal in Game 3, when David Krejci’s wrist blew up on an open-ice hit by Mike Richards. Minus any first-line offense for the rest of the series, three one-goal games and the series went Philly's way instead, and the bloodthirsty mob wanted Coach Claude Julien's head on a platter. Last season looked like a six-month replay of the final four games of that playoff series. Thanks to two in-season injuries, Krejci limped through 47 games, producing 7-24-31 totals. Captain Zdeno Chara was also twice stricken with in-season injuries, but the worst of it was the manner in which Krejci’s absences crippled longtime linemate Milan Lucic, who managed 18 goals in 81 games but rarely showed his customary intensity or trademark physicality. It is likely that Don Sweeney, Chiarelli’s replacement, took that into account when deciding that the Bruins should not tie up $7 million per on a contract extension for such a dependent, however mercurial, winger. Regardless of whether he skates with old linemates Lucic and Nathan Horton or new ones Matt Beleskey and David Pastrnak, Krejci’s healthy return is the singular reason the Bruins are a playoff team when the season opens on Thursday night against the Winnipeg Jets (7, NESN, 98.5). The basis of the Bruins and, for that matter, the foundation of any Cup contender, is elite, two-way strength down the middle of the rink. Chicago has it with Jonathan Toews, Los Angeles with Anze Kopitar and Jeff Carter, Pittsburgh with Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin. The Montreal Canadiens, who hope Alex Galchenyuk will soon fill those skates, and the N.Y. Rangers, who get superb opportunism from Derek Stepan, have been found wanting for a monster in the middle at crunch time. After their first playoff miss in eight years and a management/roster overhaul, the Bruins enter the 2015-16 season with a long list of challenges. But, with a healthy Krejci to go with perennial Selke Trophy finalist Patrice Bergeron, the major pieces are in place for Cup contention. Two-thirds of the game the opponent is trying to outscore one of these guys or the other. “I’ve been here a long time and pretty much know every player on the (opposing) team when I’m on the ice, who’s against me. I kind of know what kind of player he is so I can adjust my defensive game,” said Krejci. “It depends on who I’m playing against. It’s kind of hard for the young guy to know the other team, what his game is. I think that’s why you see the older guys are usually better in the defensive game.” Which brings us to this: Bergeron and Krejci are now the “older guys” on the Bruins. Bergeron turned 30 on July 24; Krejci will cross the threshold on April 28. The only forwards older are Chris Kelly (35 on Nov. 11) and Loui Eriksson (born a week before Bergeron). The win-now window traditionally associated with Chara (38) now applies to Bergeron, Krejci and Tuukka Rask (28). Having reached the 2013 Cup final and won the 2014 Presidents Trophy, these are the players that Sweeney needs to augment with a support group he will develop. Question is how long will it take the rest of the team to catch up? It would be easier if Chara and Dennis Seidenberg weren’t plagued in synch with their advanced years, but the captain is day-to-day with an undisclosed, upper-body injury, and Seidenberg is out seven weeks after back surgery. Torey Krug will take on the heavier lifting that he wanted to earn on merit, but the Bruins will find a level of sturdy on defense with Zach Trotman and Joe Morrow that eluded them when Dougie Hamilton and Matt Bartkowski were rushing up and down the ice. Offense is the greater challenge, and Krejci is no one’s opening pick in a fantasy-league draft. But hockey is not about aggregate production projections, it’s about chemistry and a team-wide playing style that rewards a variety of contributions as the whole seeks to become a force greater than the sum of its parts. How, much less how much new-generation Bruins Matt Beleskey, Jimmy Hayes, Brett Connolly, Joonas Kemppainen, and Zac Rinaldo contribute to the cause is difficult to predict. It was a long and trying climb that began in 2007 when the Bruins as we’ve known them these past several years began taking shape. But remember how much fun the journey itself was. A new one begins on Thursday. 5 SO LONGS 1. GM Peter Chiarelli , fired after missing the playoffs for the first time since his 2006-07 debut season, is now trying to turn Edmonton's powder-keg potential into a playoff contention. The unpardonable sin: not the playoff miss but the Bruins' trend toward soft play in general and the return from Dallas on Tyler Seguin in particular. 2. Milan Lucic , traded to Los Angeles entering the final year of a contract now paying $6 million per season. Beyond long-term, salary-cap relief, the Bruins need more consistency from their core-player cap hits than Lucic was able to muster. 3. Dougie Hamilton , the fourth-year defenseman who reportedly did not want to be a Bruin. The 21-year-old traded to Calgary for futures has star potential, but the B's will actually be better off in the immediate minus Hamilton's age-appropriate mistakes. 4. Reilly Smith , the talented young right winger who made the most-immediate impact of any player acquired in the Seguin trade, lacked sufficient compete level in his second season in Boston so Sweeney dealt him to Florida for homegrown winger Jimmy Hayes. 5. Gregory Campbell and Daniel Paille . The last two-thirds of the Merlot Line followed Shawn Thornton out the door a year later in Chiarelli's final personnel decision as Bruins GM. Campbell signed a two-year deal with Columbus. Paille was released Sept. 28 from a tryout with Chicago. Honorable mentions: Matt Bartkowski, Jordan Caron, Carl Soderberg, and Niklas Svedberg. Bartkowski signed with Vancouver; Caron was traded to (and cut by) Colorado, where Soderberg signed a five-year, $23.75 million contract . Svedberg left for the KHL. 5 NEW FACES 1. Matt Beleskey. The net-crashing left winger scored eight postseason goals for conference finalist Anaheim. At 27, Beleskey lacks Lucic's upside, but the belief is he will show up more consistently to help David Krejci work his own magic. 2. Jimmy Hayes . Dorchester bred and Boston College developed, the 6-foot-6 former Eagle doesn't fly like Smith -- the player he came from Florida for straight up -- but the right-shooting winger will go to the net and has good hands when he gets there. 3. Zac Rinaldo . The former Flyer’s goon reputation was only cemented last season after a suspension for his hit on Kris Letang. But Rinaldo also proved a much-improved player in between incidents, using his speed more for forechecking and less for reckless hits. Sweeney wants to expand his role. 4. Colin Miller . The 22-year-old defenseman who came from L.A. in the Lucic trade was slapshot and rink-lap champ in the AHL All-Star skills contest, and he helped the Manchester Monarchs cap their AHL era in New Hampshire with the Calder Cup. 5. Zane McIntyre . The Hobey Baker finalist and NCAA goalie of the year formerly known as Zane Gothberg left North Dakota after his junior year and passed on free agency to sign with Boston. He'll start his pro career in the minors. Honorable mentions : Joonas Kemppainen, 27, won't score like Soderberg, but the sturdy Finn is more solid all around. Left-shooting Matt Irwin, reportedly among San Jose's better defensemen down the stretch, signed a one-year deal. So did journeyman goalie Jonas Gustavsson to back up Tuukka Rask. 5 NEW WRINKLES 1. New GM: Don Sweeney is calling the shots. Peter Chiarelli's triumphant run ended with his first playoff miss in eight years. It seems cruel, but it's how the Bruins lost last season: They went soft. 2. Personnel change: Eight regulars left the Bruins in the offseason, and six newcomers will augment the development of a younger generation of skaters looking to establish NHL careers. 3. System tweak: A more aggressive posture on defense and transition was actually enacted last season. The Bruins will still rely on zone defense and that's a good thing especially with young players. 4. 3-on-3 OT: The NHL has taken the second part of the American Hockey League's 7-minute overtime and will play it for 5 minutes. Expect more games decided on hockey plays and fewer shootouts. 5. Coach's Challenge: As is the case now in Major League Baseball as well as the NFL, the NHL has taken the step of allowing coaches after goals to challenge on-ice goalie-interference and offsides calls. 5 PREDICTIONS 1. Presuming a healthier season for captain Zdeno Chara and no more setbacks for Dennis Seidenberg (back surgery), the Bruins will be more sound on defense. Newly promoted Zach Trotman is a steadying influence. How much better Boston is depends on Matt Irwin and Joe Morrow. 2. The challenge facing Boston's defense is not Hamilton's absence but Torey Krug's ambition. The talented blue liner wants regular duty against top-six forwards, but expect measured deployment from coach Claude Julien, who has to weigh risk against the need to establish traction. 3. Julien will have to find a 15 minutes per game for center-LW Joonas Kemppainen, whose veteran strength on the puck and reliable positional play boosts a team in generational flux. The pressure is on Ryan Spooner to make sure his third-line slot is not in jeopardy. 4. Loui Eriksson will not finish the season in Boston. The centerpiece of the Seguin trade bounced back from a two-concussion debut campaign with relentless effort. But the veteran winger has no single physical weapon to offset the temptation to cash in an expiring contract at the trade deadline. 5. Sweeney tried to diffuse Alexander Khokhlachev's rhetorical question of \"What am I doing here?\" But the disgruntled Russian center did not show enough to avoid a late-camp cut. In 2003, Russian center Sergei Zinovjev unhappily left Providence for the KHL. Koko is at risk.
