The city investigated who uses the building and for what purpose.\nCatholic Community Services organizes churches to serve dinner during the week.\nA group of friends who have a Bible study serve lunch on Thursdays and dinners on weekends.\n\"It seems like it's one of those government things where someone is making a decision when there isn't a problem to be solved,\" said Wes Howard-Brook who volunteers serving the community each Thursday.\n\"Forty to seventy-thousand meals have been served and never once have we heard of anyone being sick,\" added Howard-Brook, who is also a Professor of Theology at Seattle University. Howard-Brook said he and his friends sit down and eat with the people who come to the Community Hall; they don't just serve them.\nThe letter from the City of Issaquah also told the groups they would need to be registered as a 501(c)(3) charity and have insurance to use the space.\nThe city says it plans to work with the groups to find a way to continue the meals, but some volunteers say what the city is asking for could make that impossible.\n\"For the faith groups and service groups that provide the meals not to be able to start cooking the meals at home and bring things in would be a deal breaker, frankly,\" said volunteer Elizabeth Maupin.\nHoward-Brook said he's determined to keep the program going, no matter what, \"unless they change the locks on the building, we're planning to keep serving here.\"\nDeputy City Administrator Emily Moon told KIRO 7: \"We are currently working with the King County Health Department and Community Hall user groups to better understand how we can work together to ensure that all of the programs are delivered in a safe manner.‚Äù\ncomment (7)", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-21T00:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:20:47.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
