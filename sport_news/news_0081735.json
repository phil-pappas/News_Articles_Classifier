In the absence of a credible third force, the political scenario in the state was always dominated by the Congress in the first three-and-a-half decades and by the BJP in the past two decades. Before the formation of the BJP in the mid-80s, the role of the rather meek make-shift opposition was played by the Swatantra party in the late ’60s and later for a brief period the other anti-Congress forces brought on one platform under the banner of the Janata Dal by the then Deputy PM Morarji Desai. Elections to the local self-government bodies due in the current month was perhaps providing the best opportunity for the Congress to stage a comeback or at least dent the BJP bastion. But the Congress seems to be throwing away the opportunity in the form of Patidar (Patels) reservation agitation, by challenging in the Supreme Court the multi-candidate system in the municipal corporation wards paving the way for the shaky Anandiben Patel government to postpone the elections to all local-self government bodies in the state. The multi-member system, initiated in the Congress regime, in each ward is not new in the municipal corporations in Gujarat. But suffocated under the BJP juggernaut, some Congress leaders, about two years ago, initiated legal process against the system hoping that the direct elections would at least partially benefit the party in the municipal corporations where the saffron party held complete sway. Unfortunately for the Congress, it lost the battle in the High Court and moved the Supreme Court just before the reservation agitation united the Patel community against the BJP. Though the PAAS leaders say the agitation was non-political, many of its supporters have given open calls to vote against the BJP, which says the agitation was being run with the help of the Congress. PAAS convener Hardik Patel and convener of the United Forum for the Backward Classes Alpesh Thakore are reportedly close to Congress leaders. Despite the agitation, some senior Congress leaders are not confident about the party’s prospects in urban areas. “We may have only marginally improved our prospects in Ahmedabad, Bhavnagar and Jamnagar municipal corporations but the situation is still very tough in Surat, Rajkot, Vadodara and other municipal corporations for us,” a senior Congress leader said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:13:48.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
