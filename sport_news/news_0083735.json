The Giants came to Philadelphia on a three-game winning streak, were blown out by the Eagles and have a game next against Dallas. \n\"It's last year,\" running back Rashad Jennings said. \"Different team. Different build.\" \nAgainst the Eagles, same result. \nThe Eagles (3-3) have won two straight to move from last place in the NFC East into a tie for first with the Giants (3-3). The teams meet again in Week 17. \nNeither team looked sharp in front of a prime-time audience. They combined for seven turnovers and 21 penalties. \n\"That's bad football,\" Giants coach Tom Coughlin said. \nThe Giants gave the Eagles first downs on a roughing-the-passer penalty and a running-into-the-kicker penalty to keep both of their TD drives going. \nWearing all-black uniforms for the third time in franchise history, the Eagles got off to another slow start. \nManning completed his first 10 passes, including a 13-yard TD pass to Odell Beckham Jr. for a 7-0 lead. \nBut things went downhill for Manning from there. \nThe Eagles took a 14-7 lead in the second quarter when Carroll jumped in front of a pass intended for Dwayne Harris and ran it back untouched for his first career TD. \n\"Terrible read by me, bad decision to make that throw,\" Manning said. \"I should have gone to my next guys in my progression.\" \nAfter Nikita Whitlock ran into punter Donnie Jones to give Philadelphia a first down at its 28, Murray took over. He had two runs of 11 yards each and finished off the drive with a 12-yard TD run to give Philadelphia a 24-7 lead in the third quarter. \nMurray had his best game since joining the Eagles after a record-breaking season in Dallas. The All-Pro led the NFL in rushing last year and broke Emmitt Smith's single-season club record, but has struggled in Philadelphia. He entered the game with 130 yards this season. \n\"We know we have a long way to go,\" Murray said. \nThe Eagles were 1-3 before a 39-17 win over the New Orleans Saints at home last week. They'll travel to play unbeaten Carolina (5-0) next Sunday night. \nBradford had a pair of third-quarter interceptions on poor throws, including one that Landon Collins picked in the end zone. \nBut Philadelphia's defense bailed him out. \n\"We need to improve on offense,\" coach Chip Kelly said. \nThe Giants came out playing Kelly's style of football, running a no-huddle offense. They moved right down the field and Manning connected with Beckham across the middle for a score. \nBeckham, active after suffering a hamstring injury last week, had all seven catches in the first half. \nThe Eagles went three-and-out on their first possession and the Giants were driving with a first down at Philadelphia's 23 when DeMeco Ryans stole the ball from Larry Donnell for an interception. \nA roughing-the-passer penalty on Damontre Moore helped the Eagles avoid another three-and-out and Bradford hit Cooper on a deep pass to tie it at 7-7. \nThe teams traded turnovers midway through the second quarter. Malcolm Jenkins forced Rashad Jennings to fumble and Ryans recovered at the Eagles 38. But Jayron Hosley intercepted Bradford's deep pass and ran it back to the Giants 42. \nNOTES: Manning is 9-14 vs. Philadelphia. ... Manning threw two picks for first time since 49ers intercepted him five times on Nov. 16, 2014. ...
