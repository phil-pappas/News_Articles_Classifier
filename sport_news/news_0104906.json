The defensive end’s role figures to expand because of injuries. (Photo: Daniel Mears / Detroit News) \nCONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Allen Park — Eric Ebron sat in front of his locker and assessed the weekend’s toll on his body, wincing as he rubbed his shoulders.\nHow did it feel to play nearly every play last weekend against the Broncos?\n“It hurts,” Ebron said, smiling. “Especially that Monday, when you wake up. How many snaps did I play?”\nThe final tally for the second-year tight end was 71 of 74 snaps, or more than 90 percent of the plays, for the second consecutive week. Through three games, he’s the third-leading receiver with 13 catches for 157 yards and two touchdowns. And while he’s eager for Brandon Pettigrew — the primary blocking tight end — to return from the hamstring injury he suffered in the opener, Ebron won’t lie.\n“Hopefully, I get it again Monday,” he said of the increased workload. “It’s great.”\nIt’s necessary, too, and therein lies one of the issues in the 0-3 start to the Lions season. Not just because of the Pettigrew injury, which certainly hasn’t helped the anemic run game or persistent pass protection issues.\nBut also because it’s the play of Ebron — and some of the other young players on this roster, ready or not — that ultimately may decide this team’s fate.\nPressure mounts \nThat begs the question, though: Where is all that young talent?\nFor a front office that has preached about a draft-and-develop strategy, the pickings are embarrassingly slim. From general manager Martin Mayhew’s first four drafts, six of the 29 players the Lions selected are still with the team. Three of those — Matthew Stafford, DeAndre Levy and Pettigrew — are from that initial 2009 class. And of Mayhew’s 16 first- and second-round picks, only a handful are starters at the moment.\nAll of this adds to the pressure on — and the expectations of — the first- and second-year pros on the roster, as well as a staff Mayhew has hailed for its ability to develop players.\nDefensively, the Lions have looked a step slow, particularly in road losses to the Chargers and Vikings. And watching the linebackers struggling in Levy’s absence, it’s impossible not to wonder about Kyle Van Noy, the injury-plagued 2014 second-round pick, who has played all of six snaps in three weeks.\nBut why aren’t we seeing more from Tahir Whitehead? One of the team’s biggest surprises last season, the rangy fourth-year linebacker has played less than a quarter of the snaps.\nThe same could be asked up front, where defensive end Devin Taylor went from inactive against the Vikings to essentially a starter’s role last weekend against the Broncos. With Ziggy Ansah (groin) perhaps sidelined this week against the Seahawks, Taylor’s role — and presumably that of second-year tackle Caraun Reid, who returned from a high-ankle sprain last week — figures to expand. But will the production follow suit?\nIt obviously hasn’t yet with a retooled offensive line, which features three starters under the age of 25, and a rookie in Laken Tomlinson, who played 80 percent of the snaps against the Broncos. The Lions rank last in the league in rushing (45 yards, 2.6 per carry) and Stafford has been pressured more than any other quarterback.\nSo is that simply a sign of youth and inexperience, or what?\n“It’s not an excuse, I can tell you that,” coach Jim Caldwell said Thursday. “It’s just a matter of, if they get enough opportunities here going forward, they’ll keep getting better. And I think they are getting better. But just how quickly?”\nA rush for rushers \nThat is the question, of course. Ready, or not?\n“I have patience,” Caldwell added, repeating one of his favorite refrains, “but I just don’t have a whole lot of time, you know what I mean?”\nThey all do now, and with a trip to Seattle on tap, it’s on line coach Jeremiah Washburn and coordinator Joe Lombardi to figure something out in a hurry. Lombardi’s scheme has been ridiculed, and rightfully so in some cases, though this “predictability” angle is — predictably — getting overblown. Still, I recall Washburn telling me this past summer what an “O-line-friendly offense” this was. And, man, with friends like this …\n“It makes sense,” Washburn told me. “It’s an offense that makes sense.”\nMaybe so, but the way this staff has used rookie running back Ameer Abdullah — or Theo Riddick, for that matter — certainly doesn’t. Not with starter Joique Bell, who missed practice Thursday with an ankle injury, totaling 22 yards on 20 carries in the first three games. And not with an offense that’s desperate to find some explosiveness.\n“I haven’t really run the ball as much as I thought I would, like in college,” Abdullah said in his weekly blog that is posted on the team’s website. “But if they say ‘Hey Ameer, we want to put the ball in your hands more,’ go for it. I’m eager to do so.”\nHe’s not the only one, I’m sure.\njohn.niyo@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/JohnNiyo \nLions at Seahawks \nKickoff: 8:30 p.m. Monday, CenturyLink Field, Seattle\nTV/radio: ESPN/97.1\nRecords: Lions 0-3, Seahawks 1-2\nLine: Seahawks by 10\nSeries: Seahawks lead 7-5 (Lions 28-24, Oct. 28, 2012)\nDid you know?
