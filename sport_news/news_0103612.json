And I say good for you, Cam. Good for you for honoring your late father who was a great player in the NFL,\" Fox Sports' Mike Pereira said .\nA source told NBC Sports the league won't increase the fines past that $11,000 mark and the NFL won't stop Heyward from taking the field.\nHowever, the fines will continue if Heyward keeps defying the league's uniform policy.\nThe NFL has come under fire these past few weeks for its strict enforcement of uniform rules.\nLast week, Heyward's teammate, running back DeAngelo Williams, was told by the league he couldn't wear pink accessories throughout the season to honor his late mother. (Video via Metastatic Breast Cancer Alliance )\nThis despite Williams being a visible part of the NFL's breast cancer awareness campaign.\n\"Pink is not a color, it's a culture for me,\" DeAngelo Williams said in an NFL breast cancer awareness video .\nIn October, the NFL allows league-approved pink accessories for NFL players, coaches and officials to raise awareness for breast cancer. Outside of that, though, the league doesn't budge.\nHeyward told ESPN he isn't trying be difficult, but wants to keep wearing the personalized eye black. He's currently appealing the NFL's first fine.\nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuP3YGY5GH8", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5vahCK0pyg", "https://twitter.com/CamHeyward/status/654340648053510144", "http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/10/18/nfl-wont-keep-cameron-heyward-from-playing-with-ironhead-eye-black-tribute/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rhf0l-PKfDU"], "published": "2015-10-19T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:37:21.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
