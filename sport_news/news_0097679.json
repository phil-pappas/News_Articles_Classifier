He faces competition from his team-mates Karim Benzema of France and Welshman Gareth Bale who make up the Spanish side's 'BBC' frontline. \nJoining them are four-times winner Lionel Messi, the Argentine great, and his fellow South American strikers Neymar and Luis Suarez who form Barcelona's feared MSN frontline that fired a combined 122 goals last season. \nBarcelona, who won La Liga, the Champions League and domestic cup last year, have the most players on the shortlist with Spanish midfielder Andres Iniesta, Argentine utility player Javier Mascherano and Croatian Ivan Rakitic joining their front three on the award. \nReal Madrid have five players on the list with Colombian James Rodriguez and German World Cup-winner Toni Kroos also named. German champions Bayern Munich also have five representatives with Robert Lewandowski, Thomas Mueller, Arjen Robben, Arturo Vidal and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. \nVidal is joined by Chilean compatriot Alexis Sanchez after their Copa American success in July. \nManchester City midfielder Yaya Toure, winner of the last four African Player of the Year awards, is the only non European or South American to make the list. \nThe list was composed by the FIFA Football Committee and a group of experts from France Football. The winner will be announced in Zurich on January 11. \nShortlist", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T12:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:28:31.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
