And yes, it will be replayed for 1,000 years. And yes, if you’re a Florida State fan you won’t ever forget it. \nBut it wasn’t the block that lost the game for the Seminoles on Saturday night in Atlanta. It wasn’t the subsequent incredible return around the entire FSU field-goal unit either. \nIt was the offense. Plain and simple. The offense did not do its job on Saturday night against one of the worst defenses it will face this season. \nAfter a 500-plus yard performance against Miami, followed by a 35-point second half against Louisville, we thought the 2015 offense had found itself. \nJimbo Fisher said he thought it was growing up. \nOn Saturday night, in an unfathomable 22-16 loss, it proved it still had a long way to go. \nThe Seminoles can play well at home. They’ve proven that now. \nBut on the road, well, it’s a whole different story. Great offenses don’t care where the play. Your house. Their house. Somebody else’s house. It doesn’t matter. They’re going to roll. We saw that first-hand two years ago. \nWell. This isn’t a great offense. It might be a good one when it’s all said and done. But on Saturday night it was flat-out bad. That’s the only way to put it. Georgia Tech hadn’t stopped anyone all year not named Alcorn State. The Yellow Jackets got destroyed by Clemson and gave up 31 to an offensively challenged Pitt team the week before. \nBut on Saturday night, it held to Florida State to just 16 points. One touchdown. And 280 yards of total offense — almost 100 yards less than Georgia Tech was allowing coming into the game. \nThe mistakes were too many to list here. So I’ll just give a few of the lowlights: A false start on the 4-yard line going into to put the game away. A quick snap before Everett Golson was ready. Another false start on the final drive before the kick, making a long field goal even longer. \nA drop by Travis Rudolph on the play before the attempt. Whiffs in pass protection for much of the night, causing Golson to take more hits than he’s taken all year. \nAnd on and on and on. \n“We lost poise,” FSU head coach Jimbo Fisher said. “That’s what happened. And it snowballed.” \nSometimes teams have bad nights. And maybe that’s what this was. We’ll see. Maybe this was a hiccup. But it’s become all too common with this offense on the road. Against Boston College it did nothing. Against Wake Forest it didn’t do much more. \nAnd then on Saturday night, in Atlanta, with plenty of garnet in the stands, it struggled again. That’s a bad trend. Especially because these aren’t exactly houses of horror. If the Florida State offense can’t function at a high rate at Bobby Dodd Stadium, what’s it going to look like at Death Valley? \nThat’s a scary thought. I know. \nThe Seminoles have one of the best players in the country at running back. A senior QB who seemed to be coming into his own and a stable of four- and five-star receivers. \nOn Saturday night it didn’t matter. \nOne of those five-star receivers, Travis Rudolph, inexplicably didn’t get a foot down in the end zone on what should have been an easy TD catch. He then dropped what would have been a first-down pass on the first drive of the second half. \nAnd he then had a game-clinching TD pass ripped out of his arms in the end zone in the fourth quarter — which wound up being FSU’s first offensive turnover of the year when it bounced into a Georgia Tech defender’s arms. \nThis is how upsets happen. When the more talented team makes mistakes. Lots and lots of mistakes. Especially in big spots. The Seminoles scored one touchdown on Saturday night and that was a two-yard drive after a Lamarcus Brutus interception. \nThat just can’t happen. No matter how young you are on offense. That’s how you get beat. That’s how you lose to a team that was on a five-game losing streak. \n”I thought we were getting better, and I still think we’re getting better,” Fisher said. “We just have to put the ball into the end zone. \n... We can’t go out there and fool around. We get in the red zone and have to score touchdowns. We didn’t do it.” \nAnd that’s why the Seminoles were having to attempt a 56-yard field goal on the final play of the game instead of cruising to another ACC win. And that’s why they left Atlanta with a loss for the ages. One that nobody will forget anytime soon. 170 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN 11 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.tdo.com/1N0eDgm TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:14:19.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
