The team that finished third in the nation a year ago has has opened 2015 with three straight meet victories. \nIn those three meets, Trost is one of three Bulldogs to have turned in three straight top 10 finishes, joining senior captain Hannah Olson and junior Breanna Colbenson. \nAnd it's that trio UMD plans to rely on all season long. \n\"Every single person has a job to do,\" head coach Joanna Warmington said. \"Emi, Hannah, and Breanna have the job of beating the No. 1 runners from every other team. My fourth and fifth runners, they know it's kind of going to come down to them. Each person I've had individual talks with, they know who they need to beat.\" \nThat team-first mentality this fall has opened the door for runners like senior Erica Seidenkrantz, who has seen her role steadily expand as her career's gone on. \n\"I've definitely kind of worked my way up. I've always been in that middle pack, but this year I'm really trying to help be a point scorer,\" she said. \"Personally, it's been fun to watch my progress over the past four years here, and hopefully it ends on a good note.\" \nThat good note would be a return to the NCAA meet, something that's become an expectation of this UMD program. \n\"It adds a different mindset going into races where you can't let your guard down for a minute,\" Trost said. \"You have to always be pushing, always be going.\" \n\"It's Division II, but I have, quite honestly, Division I-caliber athletes who make this program work,\" Warmington said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:33:28.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
