The postseason in baseball. The stretch run in NASCAR. Hockey and basketball are getting started.\nEven in an age when you can do just about everything you want to do, and whenever you want to do it, the TV networks are garnering their audience share through sports programming.\nFor example:\n•NBC Sports reports that for the first time in the 10-season history of NBC's Sunday Night Football, viewership and household rating have increased in each of the network's first five games.\nThrough the first four weeks of the season (five telecasts), NBC's Sunday Night Football is averaging 25.3 million viewers — the best viewership for the NFL's broadcast prime-time package at this point in the season since 26.3 million watched in the first quarter of the 1993 season.\nThis is according to official national data released by The Nielsen Co.\nSunday Night Football, which has been television's top-rated show for the past four seasons, has seen a 9 percent increase in viewership from this point last year. The Saints' overtime win over the Cowboys on Sunday night drew an average of 24.2 million viewers, up 5 percent from the Week 4 SNF matchup between the same two teams in 2014.\n•ESPN's Monday Night Football package isn't doing badly either. The Seahawks' controversial win over the Lions this week won the night in all key ratings demographics with a 9.0 household rating and 14.4 million viewers. It was ESPN's most-watched game of the season.\n•ESPN kept the momentum going on Tuesday when its coverage of the American League Wild Card game between the Astros and Yankees delivered the highest rating for MLB on ESPN in 12 years and was the most-watched MLB Wild Card game ever. Viewership was up 50 percent over last year's KC-Oakland AL Wild Card battle.\n•Then keeping the baseball momentum going, Nielsen reported that TBS's NL Wild Card game between the Pirates and Cubs Wednesday night gave TBS its best Wild Card numbers ever (a 5.5 overnight rating) and its best overall baseball performance since Game 5 of the 2011 NLDS between the Cardinals and Phillies.\nCan the baseball momentum continue?\nAs long as the games aren't competing with the NFL or big college games and as long as compelling teams with national followings like the Cubs, Dodgers and Mets hang around.\nYou'd think the American League, however, would be in trouble in terms of national interest with the Royals, Rangers, Astros and Blue Jays left, but the TV execs always say that the deeper the series go, the more people watch.\nOne thing that veteran TV watchers like me miss is having one network doing all of the games.\nOr at least one network per round doing all of the games.\nIt's tough to keep track of which games are on Fox Sports 1 or regular Fox or TBS or the MLB Network, etc.\nIn the old days — and I was reminded of this when watching a replay of the Reggie Jackson's 3-HR performance against the Dodgers in the 1977 World Series on YES on Wednesday — you knew one network would basically have all of the postseason games and you didn't need a score card to know the announcers.\nJackson's big game was broadcast on ABC with Keith Jackson (yes, the guy more associated with college football), Howard Cosell and Tom Seaver in the booth. \nDid you know? \nComcast SportsNet announced Wednesday that former Philadelphia 76er and NBA vet Alaa Abdelnaby has joined the Sixers broadcast team. He'll join veteran play-by-play man Marc Zumoff and Molly French (formerly Molly Sullivan) for the 2015-16 season. They made their debut Wednesday night on the Comcast Network when Philly met the Cavs.\nAbdelnaby played five seasons in the NBA and was with the Sixers in 1995.\nHe brings considerable broadcasting experience, having worked as a color commentator for Westwood One Radio. He also serves as a color commentator and studio analyst with CBS Sports Network. Abdelnaby has done many NCAA Tournament games, including the 2015 Final Four featuring 76ers rookie Jahlil Okafor playing for Duke.\nAbdelnaby is a 1990 Duke grad.\nFantasy farce \nFull disclosure is required here first.\nI am involved in several fantasy leagues and have enjoyed laying down a dollar or two on a sporting event on my trips to Las Vegas. Do I enjoy watching sporting events without having anything at stake? Of course, although I understand that if you took all betting and fantasy stuff out of football, the interest level would drop off to a larger degree than you'd expect.\nAll that said, I have come to loathe all of the advertisements who perpetuate the myth that it's so easy to win big on things like DraftKings and FanDuel.com.\nIt's great for the networks to have all kinds of new ad revenue flowing in and the NFL and these companies have clearly embraced one another. \nHowever, just as it's more than a little far-fetched to believe that you and your spouse are going to end up in separate bath tubs overlooking the ocean by taking Cialis, it's foolhardy to believe that DraftKings and FanDuel are going to make you rich.\nA New York Times story earlier this week pointed out the negatives and misconceptions, including the report of a data breach involving DraftKings employee Ethan Haskell.\nI applaud ESPN for removing sponsored segments by these organizations, although they stopped short of not running its ads. Business is business after all.\nBut seeing these claims of so many winning big amounts of money, I am reminded of my experiences in Vegas and Atlantic City where I always come home a little less wealthy than when I arrived. \nIf more people won than lost, I'm constantly reminded, those extravagant hotel-casinos on the Las Vegas Strip and the boardwalk would have never been built.\n.\nKEITH'S CAN'T MISS … ESPN's excellent \"30 for 30\" documentary series returns on Tuesday night with \"Trojan War,\" which is a look at Pete Carroll's reign over the USC football program.
