They are demanding that the police locate their children without any further delay. Rajendar Singh Rawat, Thatyud police station in charge, said the husband, Rajpal Pundir, had filed a complaint on October 8 that his wife, Sangeeta, had gone missing. The police began the search for Sangeeta but were unsuccessful. On October 11, Pundir also went missing, creating more suspense in the case. The couple has a 14-month-old baby. The police have now registered a case of kidnapping under Section 365 of the IPC and have started looking for the couple in the region. Rajendar Singh Rawat said some villagers, who were acquainted with Sangeeta saw her around noon on October 8 in Mussoorie. The police have also questioned people running an NGO in Mussoorie on their role in the matter as rumour had it that they were offering the woman a job. Rawat said members of the NGO, while being questioned, did not reveal much and claimed that they were not aware about any such incident. The police have also questioned Sulochna, the maternal aunt of Rajpal Pundir but without any results, said Rawat. The police have formed several teams and were conducting raids in and around the region to locate the missing couple. However, the mobile phones of the couple, which were showing their location in Mussoorie, have gone untraceable now, making it more difficult for the police to look for them. The issue has created tension in the region and the fear of it escalating into a communal as people are angry with the Christian NGOâ€™s working in the area. Villagers are blaming the NGO for forceful conversions. However, no such case has been reported so far. The parents of both the couple have demanded that the police locate their wards before it was too late. The police are looking into various angles to crack the case.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:15:02.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
