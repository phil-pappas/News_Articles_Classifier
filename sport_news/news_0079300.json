Temperatures rose to within a few of degrees of 60Â° which is near average, or just above average, for late October. \nClear to mostly clear skies overnight tonight with calm winds and lows dropping to the 30s. \nSunday morning will be mostly clear but clouds will drift over in the afternoon so afternoon skies will be partly to mostly cloudy. Afternoon temperatures still reaching the 50s to 60s. \nChance for rain Monday afternoon through Tuesday for most of the area. If temperatures can get cold enough, fast enough, some snow is possible in the Black Hills with this next round of rain. Highs next week will start off in the 50s and slowly cool to the upper 40s by the end of week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T10:19:34.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
