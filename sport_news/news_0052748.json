Glanton, Sr. Field.After edging New Manchester 37-34 last week, the Spartans improved to 3-1 in region play, kept a slight edge against East Paulding and remained on the heels of Allatoona, which leads the region with a 4-1 record following a 35-14 win against Alexander last Friday.Even though South Paulding allowed its highest point total of the season against New Manchester, the Spartans scored in a variety of ways. LJ Pope and Michael Carter II both had kickoff returns for touchdowns. Noah Isley threw a touchdown pass to Donovan Kuykendall. Zakiah Lee returned a fumble for a score and Kameron Watts rushed for 147 yards and a TD.On defense, Dawson Mitchell led the way with 17 tackles and Jake Yetter added eight stops.“LJ Pope is one of the better receivers in the region,” Paulding County coach Scott Hamilton said. “They have a big, physical offensive line and defensively they don’t beat themselves.”Now, the Spartans are preparing for Paulding County which hopes to make things even tighter in the region.“The region is so tight right now,” Hamilton said. “Everybody is sitting at one or two losses. You can’t afford to lose three games. It is a very important game so we definitely got to play well. We got to win two out of the next three games for us to get into the playoffs so it’s important to get this one since we are playing Allatoona and New Manchester in the next two games.”Last week, the Patriots fell to 2-2 in league play following a 35-21 setback to East Paulding.“We didn’t play well on special teams,” Hamilton said. “We didn’t get many three-and-outs on defense. East Paulding did a real good job of driving the football and running down hill. We take our hats off to them for that. The two turnovers in the red zone were obviously not good and that comes back to me. We should have tried to pound the ball in instead of passing it.”South Paulding extended its all-time lead in the series against Paulding County to 6-1 last year with a 42-29 victory. The Spartans have also won the last five meetings. “We can’t beat ourselves,” Hamilton said. “Of the three phases of the game, offense, defense and special teams, we always look to win two out of the three. South Paulding is good in three phases. They score a lot of points so we have to score because we know they are going to.”Elsewhere in the region, Hiram is on a two-game winning streak and upped its region mark to 2-2 with a 39-21 victory over Lithia Springs. This Friday, the Hornets host Alexander, which lost its first game of the season last week. Hiram owns a 3-2 edge in the all-time series but fell short 40-35 last year.Meanwhile, East Paulding hosts Chapel Hill, which defeated Villa Rica 40-21 last week and snapped a two-game losing streak.
