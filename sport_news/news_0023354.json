PHILADELPHIA — Eli Manning is what separates the Giants from the Eagles, Cowboys and Washington and makes them the favorite to hold onto first place over the next 2½ months and win the watered-down NFC East.\nIt’s the logical assumption after a quick survey of the dreadful quarterback situation around the division, where the other three teams are 2-3 and the Giants are 3-2 with a three-game winning streak.\nThe Eagles, however, are conceding nothing to Manning on Monday night at The Linc or the rest of this season, even though Sam Bradford is their quarterback.\n“Just to be able to say that just because they have Eli Manning that they are going to win the division — I think that is pretty ludicrous,” Eagles safety Walter Thurmond III said Wednesday.\nOf course, Eagles-Giants games are always spiced with the best trash-talking in the league — even Eagles fan and multiple Academy Award nominee Bradley Cooper joined the fun last year — and it started again Wednesday in the Philadelphia secondary with Thurmond, a Giant for the first two games last year until he suffered a season-ending torn pectoral muscle, and safety Malcolm Jenkins.\nBradford has been rusty and inconsistent (8 TDs, 6 INTs) coming back from two straight years of ACL surgery. The incredibly mediocre Kirk Cousins starts for Washington. Tony Romo is out at least another month with a broken collarbone and Jason Garrett is switching to journeyman Matt Cassel after Brandon Weeden was 0-3.\nSo, I asked Thurmond and Jenkins: Does Manning, with his two Super Bowl rings, give the Giants the edge in the NFC East?\n“I mean, I can’t say that,” Thurmond said. “It’s a team sport. Not one man can win games for you. We always put so much praise on the quarterback. You have to play smart football. It’s a long season. I’m going to ride with this team within any game, any opponent, to win any division out there despite having a veteran quarterback who has two Super Bowl rings. He didn’t win those championships alone. Last time I recall, he had a great defense, great front four, great front seven. To say one man won that Super Bowl, I can’t agree with that. Defense wins championships.”\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE\nThurmond enjoyed his short time with the Giants. He said the Giants wanted him to return to his nickel corner role. He wanted a chance to compete to be a starter, but the Giants were locked in with Prince Amukamara and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie.\nAs a result, Thurmond signed instead with the Eagles. He played his final year at Oregon in 2009 for Chip Kelly, who is collecting former Ducks in Philly. Kelly moved Thurmond to safety, where he starts next to Jenkins, who also is not jumping on the Manning bandwagon, even as the Giants QB comes off a three-touchdown, 441-yard performance that earned him NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors.\nAl Bello/Getty Images Sam Bradford continues to be inconsistent in his first five weeks as Eagles quarterback. Does Manning give the Giants the edge in the NFC East?\n“I don’t think so,” Jenkins said. “Obviously, he’s probably, you look at all the quarterbacks in the division, he’s got two Super Bowl championships, so you have to respect that. He’s probably played at a higher level than every single one of them over the entirety of his career. But I don’t think I would look at the Giants and feel like they have an edge over us. I’m on one of the division teams, so I would say no.”\nLast year, the Giants went into Philadelphia at 3-2 for a Sunday night game and were embarrassed, 27-0. They lost Victor Cruz to a season-ending knee injury and it began a seven-game losing streak.\nIt followed a week of trash talking that the Giants could not back up. It began with Amukamara and DRC posing with a Giants fan in an Eagles jersey. On the back of the jersey it said, “SUPERBOWLS,” and beneath it said, “0.” The players made a circle with their fingers.\nThe Eagles countered by producing a cartoon starring “Little Eli,” being taunted by Eagles defenders in the dark. His jersey is pulled over his head and his underwear is pulled up.\n“This is horrible,” Manning says in the video. “I can’t see a thing. Somebody please, fix my underwear. I’m so scared. Every single time with these Eagles. Get me out of Philadelphia.”\nCooper got in the act with a voice-over of a video. “You want to know the best way to shut a loud-mouth up?” Cooper asks. “Shut it for them.”\nA few days later, the Giants finished their pre-game warmups by huddling at midfield and then stomping on the Eagles logo. A few hours later, their season was on the way to being ruined. Manning threw for only 151 yards and Odell Beckham was held to two catches for 28 yards. The Eagles won the rematch, 34-26, in the final game of the season when both teams had been eliminated from playoff contention. Manning threw for 429 yards and OBJ had 12 catches for 185 yards.\nManning is off to a hot start with 10 TDs, 2 INTs and is completing a career-high 66.5%.\nThe Eagles are not concerned. They have Bradford.\nRelated Stories Amukamara uncertain for Giants-Eagles with pectoral injury Vacchiano: Five Giants players who could give Big Blue boost", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T07:27:21.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
