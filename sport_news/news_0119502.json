Chengelis, John Niyo and Bob Wojnowski of The Detroit News offer their predictions for Saturday's Michigan State-Rutgers game. \nMatt Charboneau: Michigan State has been seeking a complete performance all season and Rutgers just might be the perfect opponent. Rutgers has shown it can move the ball at times, but the defense has been abysmal at times and the Michigan State offense needs to break out before it heads to Michigan next week. This should be the game it all comes together. Michigan State 38-10 \nAngelique S. Chengelis: Michigan State has been dealing with injuries and a scare against Purdue last Saturday. Michigan State will re-focus and will avoid looking ahead to its opponent next week, Michigan. On the road at Rutgers isn’t going to provide another scare. Michigan State 35-21 \nJohn Niyo: Rutgers had a week off, but the Scarlet Knights are still without their coach and they’ve yet to a face a team that resembles Michigan State. This probably won’t be the rout it was a year ago, but it’s a good chance for the Spartans to quiet some of their critics with a runaway win. Michigan State 38-13 \nBob Wojnowski: This looks like a softie, but the Spartans haven’t exactly been squishing the softies. Rutgers gets WR Leonte Carroo back from suspension, and you can bet he’ll challenge Michigan State’s suspect secondary. The Scarlet Knights have been a disaster, but this is their chance for a perception-changer in prime time. The Spartans can’t overlook anyone, and I think they know it.
