The Bulldogs held Kipp Pride to minus-7 yards of total offense in the first half while recovering three fumbles on a rainy Thursday night en route to a 35-0 nonconference victory. Kipp Pride (0-5) picked it some in the second half and finished with 57 yards of total offense, but the damage by Dixon (3-3) had been done. The Bulldogs took a 14-0 lead into halftime, and the Panthers never really threatened as Dixon posted its first shutout this year in the first meeting between the two schools. The game was moved up one day because of concerns about Hurricane Joaquin. “In the first half we did (execute defensively),” Dixon first-year coach Chris Morris said. “We’ve played really well on defense all year, but we’ve always had a problem with slow starts where maybe we would shut a team out in the second half after giving up two or three touchdowns in the first half. It was good to put two halves together.” The Bulldogs’ 35 points were the most in one game all season, although just one score would have been enough to defeat Kipp Pride, a magnet school from Gaston which hits the field Monday at North Edgecombe for a game that was postponed last week. The Panthers had many runs of just 2 or 3 yards while Kipp Pride quarterback Marin Moody was dropped for minus-56 yards rushing. He lost 28 yards when he was called for an intentional grounding penalty while trying to scramble. The Panthers’ only first down before halftime came on their first drive and came as a result of an offsides penalty on Dixon on fourth-and-5 from the Kipp Pride’s 25. The Panthers, who moved the ball slowly but effectively for one drive to reach the Dixon 18-yard line late in the third quarter, recorded their biggest gain on a 22-yard reception by Antionio Davis in the fourth quarter. “We knew they were a power team and we tried to shut down the middle and everything from the A to C gaps,” said Dixon senior defensive lineman Marcus Estrellado, who had one of the Bulldogs’ three fumble recoveries. “I think our defense has good chemistry and we communicate together.” Morris said the defensive key was Dixon being disciplined, especially on the line. “Everyone was where they were supposed to be and they were being aggressive and getting off the football,” he said. “They tried to get off blocks and get in the backfield.” Dixon’s offense gave its defense all the needed scoring when the Bulldogs scored on the game’s opening drive after recovering an onside kick at the 50. Page 2 of 3 - Dixon marched down the field on 11 plays, capping the drive that lasted 6:11 with a 19-yard touchdown run by Deante Jackson to go ahead 7-0. The key play was Estrellado’s 11-yard catch to the Kipp Pride 23 on fourth-and-5. “I think that drive was good for the kids’ confidence,” Morris said. “They did what they were supposed to do. We’ve had other games where we didn’t settle down and start executing the game plan until about two or three series into the game.” Dixon extended its lead to 14-0 on its next drive when James Witherspoon scored on a 31-yard touchdown run. The Bulldogs, though, had chances to build their in the second quarter, but lost fumbles on consecutive possessions inside the red zone. “We went into the locker room and everybody already knew that we kept them in the game a little bit,” Estrellado said. “We got a little frustrated there.” However, Dixon didn’t let its next opportunity slip away after Kipp Pride turned the ball over on downs at its own 25 to open the third quarter. The Bulldogs went up 21-0 on Brandon Horsley’s 29-yard touchdown pass to Estrellado. On the play, Estrellado was wide open when it caught the ball at the 20 and darted untouched into the end zone. Jackson added a 47-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter while Antonio Neal had a 27-yard scoring run late for the final scoring. “What we try to do is manage the clock, run it down and score,” Estrellado said. “We then have our defense hold them off.” Dixon had three ballcarriers with at least seven rushes and at least 50 yards with Jackson leading the way with 76 yards on eight runs. Witherspoon added 59 yards on seven totes while Stoney Fuqua had 50 yards on eight carries while also playing quarterback at times. “We ought to have at least three every week pretty even in carries and in production,” Morris said. “Tonight, a part of the game plan was to get as many people touches as possible. We are happy we were able to do that.” And Morris is happy his team picked it up after its open date last week to earn its second consecutive win entering its East Central 2-A Conference opener Oct. 9 at Northside (4-2). “We are happy we held on for the shutout and happy we won to get back to .500,” Morris said. “But in the first half we feel we didn’t play very well. We have plenty of things we need to get to work on tomorrow to try to fix.” Kipp Pride 0 0 0 0 — 0 Page 3 of 3 - Dixon 14 0 7 14 — 35 First Quarter D – Jackson 19 run (Parker kick), 4:49 D – Witherspoon 31 run (Parker kick), 0:42.7 Third Quarter D – Estrellado 29 pass from Horsley (Parker kick), 8:15 Fourth Quarter D – Jackson 47 run (Parker kick), 11:22 D – Neal 27 run (Parker kick), 1:49 K D", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:23:11.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
