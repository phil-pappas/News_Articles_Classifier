These are the Jets' only back-to-back road games of the season. \nPLUS: Jets report card, as they come up short once again vs. New England Patriots \nHere's a look at Bowles' Monday injury update: \n• C Nick Mangold (neck): The Jets got good news coming out of the game. An X-ray , CT scan, and MRI examination on Mangold's neck were all negative. He just has \"a sore neck,\" according to Bowles. That is no small thing, but it could've been worse. Bowles said he's not sure if Mangold will be able to play in Oakland. He is one of the Jets' most important players. His backup, Dakota Dozier, didn't play at all last year as a rookie. Dozier just learned to play center this offseason. He had played exactly one snap, ever, in an NFL game (as Mangold's momentary replacement) before getting in for three snaps Sunday after Mangold hurt his neck late in the game. Bowles said his concern level about Mangold is \"not as much as it would've been, had the X-rays showed something else. I don't know the timetable on him getting better. I just know it's not as bad as we thought it was. He's sore. He's got to get treatment and see if it loosens up.\" Bowles said his understanding, from speaking with the Jets' medical staff, is that this isn't a stinger-related situation, but rather \"a muscle, neck injury.\" Mangold has previously experienced stingers during his 10-year NFL career. \n• S Calvin Pryor (ankle): He has a sprained ankle, according to Bowles. Pryor left Sunday's game and didn't return. Dion Bailey, the Jets' only backup safety, replaced Pryor. Bailey wound up playing 42 percent of the Jets' defensive snaps Sunday. It's not clear how severe Pryor's sprained ankle is. \n• P Ryan Quigley (shin): Steve Weatherford struggled as Quigley's (likely) one-day replacement in New England. Bowles said he'll know more Wednesday about Quigley's status for Oakland. Presumably, once Quigley is healthy, Weatherford will be released. Bowles said Quigley is \"feeling better, but I've got to see how much better.\" Bowles wants to see Quigley punt, perhaps as early as Wednesday, before making a decision about Weatherford's status. Bowles on Monday also confirmed what Weatherford said after the game — that Weatherford, who lives in Tenafly, was really the Jets' only option, because Quigley showed up Saturday with an unforeseen injury. \"He was the only one in close proximity, that could probably get on a plane, that we kind of knew at that point in time,\" Bowles said. \n• CB Buster Skrine (finger, shoulder): He sustained a shoulder injury after making a big, clean hit in New England, but later returned to the game. He had a bulky wrap on a couple fingers after the game, and Bowles confirmed Monday that Skrine has a finger injury. \"But he'll be OK,\" Bowles said. \n• DE Sheldon Richardson (arm): He left Sunday's game briefly, but returned. He looked fine after the game, and Bowles didn't mention him as being on the injury report Monday. \n• WR Devin Smith: He was limping in the locker room after the game, but also isn't on the injury report, according to Bowles. \"So right now, he's OK,\" Bowles said. \n• RB Stevan Ridley (knee): The Jets opted not to bring him off the physically unable to perform list for the Patriots game. But they almost decided to activate him. \"It was fairly close at the time,\" Bowles said. \"But we didn't feel like it was necessary to use him at that time.\" The Jets went with Chris Ivory and Zac Stacy as their only running backs in New England. Ivory played through hamstring tightness, but said he expects be OK for the Oakland trip. \n• S Jaiquawn Jarrett (knee, shoulder): The Jets on Saturday waived him with an injury designation. The move created a roster spot for Weatherford. Jarrett passed through waivers, as expected, and was placed on the Jets' season-ending injured reserve list. So what's the deal with Jarrett, a backup safety? \"He's got a sore knee and he's got a sore shoulder,\" Bowles said. \"It's been lingering on for a while now. From what they tell me, one of them is pretty serious.\" Jarrett is scheduled to become a free agent after this season. \nDarryl Slater may be reached at dslater@njadvancemedia.com .
