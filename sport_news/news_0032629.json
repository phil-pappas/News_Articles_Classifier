KING -- State Journal \nIowa linebacker Cole Fisher (36) pressures Wisconsin quarterback Joel Stave (2) on a pass in the fourth quarter of a game at Camp Randall Stadium in Madison, Wis., Saturday, Oct. 3, 2015. M.P. KING -- State Journal \nUniversity of Wisconsin football fans have plenty of reason to worry about the Badgers’ offense after a mistake-filled, 6-point outing in a loss to Iowa last week. \nBelieve it or not, though, there’s also reason to believe this week will be better. \nMeet Nebraska’s passing defense, which ranks dead last in the FBS — that’s right, 128th out of 128 — allowing 353.8 yards per game through the air. \nThat’s 16.4 yards per game worse than the 127th ranked team and nearly 100 yards from even being ranked in the top 100. \nSure, the Cornhuskers rank 12th against the run, but in many cases that hasn’t made up for their poor play in the secondary. \nSome have looked at Nebraska’s three losses this season and claimed this team could easily be 5-0 right now. I suppose there’s some truth to that, but the Cornhuskers’ leaky passing defense allowed Southern Miss to come from behind two weeks ago and made the fans in Lincoln fearful of another brutal loss. \nI want to focus the majority of our film-room piece on a three-play sequence from that Southern Miss game. \nThis first one, for me, is the worst of the three. Check out the coverage from Nebraska safety Nate Gerry, manned up against the slot receiver on the far side of the field. Also keep in mind that this is a third-and-1 play. \nThat’s just too easy. Gerry plays 10 yards off the receiver on third-and-1, starts the play flat-footed and gets completely fooled by a subtle move by the receiver. \nLuckily for Gerry, the play was called back. On the next play, third-and-11, Southern Miss picked on linebacker Dedrick Young, who — to put it as nicely as possible — struggled mightily covering the running back and slot receiver in this game. \nThe Golden Eagles’ top two running backs — Ito Smith and Jalen Richard — combined for nine catches and 132 receiving yards in this game. I expect the Badgers to try to create these same type of mismatches by getting Dare Ogunbowale and Derek Watt involved in the passing game Saturday. \nOn Southern Miss’ next play, a corner gets beat on a slant and compounds the error by missing a tackle when no safety is behind him to clean up the mess. \nI’m a little surprised the Cornhuskers didn’t keep two safeties deep more often in this game. I don’t claim to be an X’s and O’s expert, but I was trying to figure out why Nebraska — in a first-and-10 situation — would call zero coverage here considering how poorly the secondary has played this season. \nBut go back and look at that video again. Watch the safety as the play begins. Unless he’s got man coverage responsibilities on the running back, it appears his job may have been as a deep safety on this play before biting badly on the play-action fake. \nIf that is the case, it’s an extremely undisciplined play that probably cost the Cornhuskers 40 yards. Relevant side note: Nebraska has given up more passing plays of 10-plus yards (66) and 20-plus yards (28) than every team in the country. Only two teams have allowed more 30-yard passing plays (15) and just four FBS teams have allowed more 40-yard gains (7). \nAgain, everything we’ve discussed thus far came from a three-play sequence against a Conference USA team. Southern Miss, thanks to a bad snap and some other miscues, actually didn’t score on that drive. After getting down 22-0, though, the Golden Eagles scored four second-half touchdowns — including three in the fourth quarter — and still had a chance to win until the final play. \nI saved seven plays from that fourth quarter that stood out as examples of poor pass coverage. My favorite of the bunch: \nI don’t know if I’ve seen many third-and-20 conversions easier than that. The safety lets the slot receiver run a post right in front of him. Again, I’m not an X’s and O’s expert, but it also seems like that wasn’t the best play call for a third-and-20 situation. Like I mentioned before, the coaching staff didn’t always help their secondary players out like you think they would. \nThe Cornhuskers got plenty of pressure on the quarterback in this game, too. That was probably one of the main reasons they avoided an upset. In one instance, Nebraska got to the quarterback so quickly that the play-by-play announcer thought Southern Miss was setting up a screen pass when they weren’t actually doing so. \nThere are some serious problems in this Nebraska secondary that the Badgers and Joel Stave — yes, h8ers, even Joel Stave — can take advantage of despite a poor performance last week, especially if Stave has time to throw and Alex Erickson (concussion) is available to throw to. He practiced Thursday and looks on track to play if he remains symptom-free. \nSouthern Miss’ four-wide receiver sets really gave Nebraska trouble. Against this team, the more defensive backs on the field, the better. It’ll be interesting to see if UW at least goes three-wide more often than it has over the first five games of the season. \nUW shouldn't worry about establishing the running game early on. Just throw it until the Cornhuskers prove they can stop it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:03:20.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
