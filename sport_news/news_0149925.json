Leicester City continued their impressive start to the season with a 2-1 victory at Norwich City. \nEngland international Jamie Vardy gave the Foxes the lead when he won and converted a penalty for his sixth goal in eight Premier League appearances. \nLeicester doubled their advantage shortly after the restart when Jeffrey Schlupp scored on the counter-attack, but Dieumerci Mbokani gave the hosts hope when he flicked home a Jonny Howson cross on 68 minutes. \nHowever, Leicester held on for a victory that leaves them fourth in the table. \nAston Villa's poor start to the season continued as they were beaten 1-0 at home by Stoke City. \nStoke scored the only goal of the game on 55 minutes when Glen Johnson picked out Marko Arnautovic, who fired a low shot past Brad Guzan. \nBournemouth played out a 1-1 draw with Watford. \nGlenn Murray gave Bournemouth the lead on his full debut for the club, heading past Heurelho Gomes on 28 minutes, but Watford were gifted an equaliser just before half-time when keeper Artur Boruc gave the ball away to Odion Ighalo for a simple finish. \nMurray had the chance to win it from the penalty spot late on, but Gomes made the save to give the Hornets a share of the spoils. \nCrystal Palace continued their impressive start to the season with a 2-0 home win over West Bromwich Albion in Saturday's early game. Yannick Bolasie made the breakthrough when he headed home Yohan Cabaye's superb cross from the left after 67 minutes, and Palace doubled their advantage when Wilfried Zaha won a late penalty, which Cabaye converted. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
