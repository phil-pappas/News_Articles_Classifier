The sport’s best pitcher decided to stick to the same sequences more than he ever had.\n“The thing I learned most from him,” Greinke said last week, “is if you get some good pitches you can almost have the same sequence, to where the hitters almost know what you’re doing. If your pitches are that good, they can't do anything with them.\n“And that's what Kershaw has done ever since I've been here.”\nThat is what Kershaw did Tuesday night to beat the New York Mets at Citi Field. He did what he always does, more or less. Throwing on one fewer day of rest than he’s accustomed to, he threw a little bit harder, with a little bit more emotion, and received results a little bit better than usual, carrying the Dodgers to a 3-1 win at Citi Field.\nThat Kershaw generally sticks to sequences more than other pitchers does not mean he is a predictable pitcher. There is enough randomness – enough entropy, to use an information theory term – that a batter cannot comfortably bet he will see something specific. The first time through New York’s order Tuesday night, no Met saw anything but a fastball until the third pitch of their at-bat.\nBut the second time through, Kershaw didn’t throw David Wright a fastball until the third pitch. The third time through, Kershaw froze Wright with a perfectly placed curveball, at the knees, in the sixth inning.\nIn general, the first breaking ball a hitter sees against Kershaw will come along the same eye level to the previous pitch he has seen. And then, at some point, close to home plate, it will diverge – sometimes wildly, in the case of the curveball, and sometimes not, in the case of the slider.\nThat Kershaw sticks to the same sequences and does not disobey what has worked in the past does not mean he is willing to elucidate those sequences in public. After he won the game for the Dodgers, he would not discuss his previous seventh-inning struggles, but he was happy to answer a question about his perceived reliance on fastballs.\n“Yeah, it really wasn’t by design,” Kershaw said, “but I think I probably did end up throwing more fastballs tonight – less sliders. Probably give (catcher A.J. Ellis) credit on that. He felt confident throwing the heater tonight with a lot of guys and we were able to get some outs behind in the count on it, which was great, some jam shots and some pop-ups, which was big.\n“But throwing fastballs will either get you in trouble or keep your pitch count down. So fortunately for me tonight it kind of kept it down a little bit.”\nEven with the early array of them, Kershaw ended up throwing 57 percent fastballs. Before Tuesday night, roughly 54 percent of his pitches were fastballs. This was not dramatically different. If it was different at all, it was because he could not command his curveball early. The first one he threw did not curve.\n“To me, this game's a lot like the other ones he's pitched,” Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. “He's pitched really good, just tonight he got the last out. He goes six, I don't want to talk about it. I know he went six scoreless last year against St. Louis. The seventh inning, you make a couple of plays and he ends up getting a big homer.”\nMattingly continued: “Tonight he was able to basically pitch the same way. Cespedes hits that chopper to lead off the inning and I was like, ‘Oh, here we go.’ But he was able to stop that.”\nHe was.\n“He definitely wanted this badly, and I'm so proud of him,” Ellis said. “I'm so proud of what he was able to do tonight, especially getting those last three outs, which were the toughest for him tonight.”\nThey were the toughest for him last year, too. And instead of altering his approach to securing them, he did what he always does, relied on the quality of his pitches and their precise locations, and found what he had previously failed to find: salvation, for a night at least.\nYou’ve heard what insanity is supposed to be: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.\nMaybe Clayton Kershaw is a little bit insane.\nContact the writer: pmoura@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:02:32.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
