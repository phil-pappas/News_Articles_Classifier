Sunderland surrendered a two-goal lead in the game and has only three points from eight matches so far in the Premier League, leaving it second from bottom in the standings. \nAllardyce says “I hope to be able to help to bring the stability and success that everyone wants.” \nThe 60-year-old Allardyce, who has also managed West Ham, Blackburn, Newcastle and Bolton in England’s top flight, will face West Brom in his first game as manager on Oct. 17. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:19:49.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
