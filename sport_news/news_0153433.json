Chest above the rim or not, major hops. MustangCat October 1, 2015 at 5:01 pm | Permalink | Reply \nIf I‚Äôm not mistaken, isn‚Äôt the top of those post 12 feet? BlueRedneck October 1, 2015 at 5:30 pm | Permalink \nMustang, depends on where you have it set, but I think they extend to that height. I guess I would expect them to have it set to the highest setting for college BB players. We use one to measure the reach of our volleyball players on our girl‚Äôs middle school team. Rarely any need to extend it above 9 feet.

I was barely able to dunk on 9.5 but after just three hard workouts with this jump trainer from this review (o2c [.] org/vert-shock-review/) I am easily able to dunk on 9.75 feet with 10.0 to come very soon.
