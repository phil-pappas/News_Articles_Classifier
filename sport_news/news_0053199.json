The rating was not immediately available. \nCompared to Game 3 of Royals/Orioles on TBS last year, which aired in the same Monday night timeslot, viewership declined 49% from 6.0 million. \nThe Blue Jays’ win scored the fourth-smallest audience ever for an LCS game, ahead of only Cardinals/Brewers Game 2 in 2011 (3.0M), last year’s aforementioned Cardinals/Giants Game 3, and Game 2 of Blue Jays/Royals on Saturday (2.7M). FS1, which has televised just six LCS games total, has already aired three of the four least-watched ever. \nKeep in mind Monday’s game faced head-to-head competition from Monday Night Football , which had an 8.7 and 13.9 million on ESPN. \nGame 3 had a 29.9 rating in Kansas City; Toronto does not count toward U.S. television ratings. \n(Mon. numbers via ShowBuzz Daily ; additional info from Sports Business Daily ) Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:06:46.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
