The Fujikura PRO60 Shaft is the latest addition to the Fujikura PRO Series, a tour proven line of shafts played by dozens of PGA Professionals to capture victories, Top-5 and Top-10 finishes. The Fujikura team of engineers used Fujikura's proprietary enso technology to develop these high performance shafts which maximize the energy transfer from the golfer to the club head at impact. enso technology allowed the engineers to employ different benefits to different types of golfers depending on their swing type. The Fujikura PRO 53, PRO 63, and PRO 73 are developed for golfers who want a mid-launch with low spin. The Fujikura PRO 73 Tour Spec is designed for a golfer with a stronger swing who can benefit from a low to mid launch with low spin. The new Fujikura PRO60 delivers a higher launch for a higher trajectory which results in increased ball flight and distance. The new PRO60 is a shaft option for the new TaylorMade M1 Driver. The company required certain shaft specification to maximize the performance of their highly engineered head. The design goal was to deliver more speed, high launch, low spin and increased ball speed so the new Fujikura PRO60 was the perfect choice to meet these key characteristics. \"This collaboration with TaylorMade is a direct result from the PRO Series success on the PGA Tour as well as from Fujikura's longtime association with the TaylorMade Tour Preferred products, added Hartgraves. The Fujikura PRO60 as well as the entire line of the Fujikura PRO Series is manufactured with Fujikura's proprietary H.I.T. Technology, (High Inertia Tip), with Maximum Carbon Fiber Content material and Cage construction for stability throughout the swing to provide more accurate shots. A custom bending profile creates a stiffened mid and tip section with more forgiveness in the handle section. For more information about the PRO60, visit the company website at www.fujikuragolf.com .About enso Technology: enso is an advanced, proprietary technology that measures actionable, pre-impact club data to facilitate the design of the most accurate and powerful golf shafts for all golfers. It was developed in 2009 with then partner Vicon Motion Capture Systems as a state-of-the-art, high-speed, 3D motion capture measurement system which measures the club (head, shaft, handle) at sub-millimeter accuracy prior to impact. Fujikura has gathered years of data over the past five years measuring different swings from all types of golfers and now is using this intelligence to deliver the head to ball ratios FASTER and more efficient than ever before.
