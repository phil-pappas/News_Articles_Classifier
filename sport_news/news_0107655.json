But there's been quite a bit about being in a different country that has thrown him off. \n\"The only thing is the food and adjusting to the time change,\" Bradham said. \"Those are the main two things. That's the big difference for me.\" \nWas Bradham expecting the food to be a bit better? \n\"Yeah, I was,\" Bradham said. \"I didn't know anything about the food. It's kind of mind-blowing.\" \nMaybe Bradham should be hanging with running back Boobie Dixon. Dixon has now been to London three different times, and he's figured out the London dining scene. \n\"My favorite spot is Novikov the restaurant,\" Dixon said. \"Oh, man. London is so amazing. That's my favorite spot. It's a must every time I come here. Everything else is just having fun and seeing what you can get into.\" \nLuckily, Bradham has been able to get into some other fun. He said his favorite part of London has been the shopping, even though the weather hasn't cooperated. \n\"I really didn't know about the weather too much,\" Bradham said. \"It's gloomy and cloudy and rainy and wet. Like, the weather is a lot different. Then it's cold, but not cold, cold. Like, it's a lot colder in Buffalo, but it's damp here. It's one of those experiences you're just lucky to have to be able come out here and play a game.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:17:23.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
