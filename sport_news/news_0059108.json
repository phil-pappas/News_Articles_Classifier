Sokolowski, USA TODAY Sports John E. Sokolowski, USA TODAY Sports TORONTO – The Kansas City Royals offered no apologies for being unable to close out the American League Championship Series.\nAdChoices But a borderline pitch in the crucial sixth inning of Wednesday’s eventual 7-1 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays … that was another story.\nIt came at the end of a 10-pitch at-bat by Jays slugger Jose Bautista.\nAfter five consecutive foul balls, Royals starter Edinson Volquez tried to sneak a curve over the outside corner.\n“I saw the pitch. I was like, ‘C’mon man, that ball curved past the plate. That’s supposed to be a strike.’” Volquez recalled as home plate umpire Dan Iassogna called it ball four.\nAfterward Volquez got quite a surprise from catcher Salvador Perez.\n“Salvy after the game came in and he said the umpire apologized. He thought it was a strike.”\nOf all the things instant replay can overturn, the home plate umpire calling balls and strikes isn’t one of them.\n“I thought the pitch to Bautista was definitely a strike,” Royals manager Ned Yost said. “And I thought we had a chance on him swinging, but we couldn’t get anybody’s attention on it.”\nAnother walk and a three-run double from Troy Tulowitzki later, the Jays were on their way to forcing Game 6 on Friday in Kansas City.\nHad the pitch gone the other way, perhaps Toronto still goes on to win. But the Royals were in no mood to dwell on might-have-beens.\n“We’re focused on playing good baseball right now,” said outfielder Alex Rios “I don’t think we’re focused on what the umpires have to say.”\n“He’s a human being too,” Volquez said. “Everybody make a mistake. It’s nothing you can do with it. You got to move forward and play another game.”\nThe Royals still managed to win one of the three games at Rogers Centre, where the Blue Jays tied for the league’s best home record.\n“In reality, your goal is to come to Toronto – a foreign environment, a hostile environment – and at least win one,” Yost said. “Then you get to go home and win one there and the series is over.”\nTo get back to the World Series for a second consecutive season, the Royals will have to get back to the things that made them successful – hitting line drives, playing solid defense and relying on strong pitching.\nYordano Ventura will take the mound in Game 6 against Blue Jays ace David Price.\nYost likes his team’s chances with the 24-year-old right-hander, who’s had an up-and-down year, but finished the regular season as the Royals’ best starter.\n“I think Johnny Cueto coming, and Eddie’s influence have helped him a lot, being a young pitcher, developing and getting his confidence back.”\nVentura allowed three runs in 5 1/3 innings in Game 2 as the Royals mounted a late comeback against Price to win.\nBut in the playoffs, momentum is fleeting. Just ask the Blue Jays, who were trounced 14-2 in Game 4 but turned the tables on the Royals in Game 5.\n“When you’re playing every day, you’ve got to have a short-term memory in this game. You have to flush it out,” said first baseman Eric Hosmer. “We’ve got a 3-2 lead and we’re heading back to Kansas City.\n“That’s where we play our best baseball and everyone is still feeling pretty good about the series.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:32:08.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
