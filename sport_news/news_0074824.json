They adopted her from an orphanage in China. \n\"Her life so far, 3 1/2 years in an orphanage and being abandoned and all that. It's amazing that she's doing so well so quickly,\" Barry said. \nThe Sioux Falls couple has two teenagers, but just a few years ago they got a passion for adoption. They adopted 2-year-old Abrielle right after she was born, and recently added Emelyn to their family. \n\"It's all about them and their life and giving them a chance at a better life,\" Barry said. \nBut that chance at a better life also comes with a price tag. They knew adopting Emelyn would cost around $40,000. Barry said it was daunting. \nThe family had a plan for the payment, but then found out they would have to travel to China in August. \n\"August is the most expensive month to travel to China,\" Dawn said. \nThat's when the couple headed online to GoFundMe. It's one of many crowdfunding websites that allows people to raise money for various life events. Along with GoFundMe, other popular crowdfunding sites include Kickstarter, RocketHub and Indiegogo. \n\"I think we got some donations from people we didn't even know,\" Dawn said. \n\"It was great financially, but it was also neat because people could post their support too,\" Barry said. \nAn increasing number of people are using crowdfunding for adoption, or in-vitro fertilization. Last year, couples raised more than $985,000. Compare that to $19,000 in 2011. \nThe Krikkes say they're thankful for resources like GoFundMe. \n\"The amount of children in China that are orphans. Their situation is at the age of 14 if they are not adopted, they are put out on the street,\" Dawn said. \nThankfully, that's not a situation Emelyn will likely ever face. \n\"She laughs easily and quickly. She has a good sense of humor,\" Dawn said. \n\"Right away you start falling in love with her,\" Barry said. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
