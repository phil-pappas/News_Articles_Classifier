It may be recalled that statehood agitators on their way to New Delhi were stopped by the Uttar Pradesh Police at Rampur Tiraha in Muzzafarnagar district. The police fired at the agitators and committed atrocities on October 2, 1994, resulting in the death of seven statehood agitators. Dhirendra Pratap said a new inquiry commission should be formed to ensure punishment to the police and administration officials responsible for the Rampur intersection incident that took place in Muzaffarnagar on October 2, 1994. “Despite the seriousness of the crimes committed, not a single police or administrative official has been punished even after 21 years of the incident. If many commissions can be formed to inquire into the 1984 riots and other incidents, then those guilty of crimes against the Uttarakhand statehood activists should also face the law,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:29:43.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
