Djokovic touched down for his third Thailand trip yesterday while Nadal arrived for his second, both having previously competed in the now-defunct ATP Thailand Open \"It's a pleasure to be back in the place known for its tennis history, with the Thailand Open having been held for so many years. All the best players have played here. I hope the Thailand Open will come back very soon,\" said Djokovic, who has unhappy memories of the 2008 final, which he lost to Jo WilfriedTsonga In fact neither of these giants of the game has ever won a trophy in Thailand, despite boasting 24 majors between them. Nadal's best run was in 2010, when fellow Spaniard Guillermo GarciaLopez upset him in the semis. \"It's very special to be back. I was here in 2010 and the people were amazing,\" said Nadal. \"I took back some unforgettable memories of Thailand. Thank you very much to the Thai fans, who made me feel like [I was at] home when I arrived here.\" Nadal looked in tip-top condition as he practised under the watchful eye of his uncle and coach Toni at the match venue yesterday, before joining Djokovic for a press conference. \"I hope that the people who decide to come and watch the match will go back home with good feelings. We will try our best to create the right show for them,\" said the Spaniard, who also paid compliment to Djokovic for his success in clinching the Australian Open, Wimbledon and French Open in a single calendar year. \"I told him privately after the US Open, but this time I am making it public. Novak has had an amazing season. The way he has been playing for the whole season, the mental strength and the level of tennis is difficult to match. Congratulations for that.\" Djokovic had some words of advice for young Thai players. \"Rafa and I are very fortunate to be playing a sport that we love. We know how hard it is to arrive at the point we are today. The kids should enjoy what they do, love hitting the tennis balls. It's the main source of motivation. You have to understand why you have to wake up every morning and do what you are doing,\" said the world No 1, who had a practise session with Thai national players Pruchya Isarow and Puriwat Chatpatcharoen yesterday evening after he and Nadal took a shopping trip to the EmQuartier mall's OTOP store. Today, Djokovic and Nadal will stop by at the Grand Palace at 10.15am to sign a book of wellwishes for His Majesty the King then drop in at Government House to visit with Prime Minister Prayut Chanocha. Prior to their showdown, a special mixed doubles exhibition match will serve as an official farewell to tennis for Danai Udomchoke. Danai will pair with Noppawan Lertcheewakarn and play Paradorn Srichaphan and Tamarine Tanasugarn in a best-of-nine game format. Elsewhere, in the US$15,000 Chang ITF Pro Circuit, qualifier Varunya Wongteanchai continued her impressive run by stunning sixth seed Nicha Lertpitaksinhcai 16 61 62 in the quarterfinals yesterday. Varunya benefited from a barrage of unforced errors from the Circuit 3 champion, who was playing despite an injury to her left calf, to take the match in one hour and 46 minutes. She will play top seed Ayaka Okuno of Japan, who beat Alice Bacquie of France 62 64, in today's semifinals. Joining Varunya in the final four was Kamonwan Buayam, who came back from a break down in the second set to beat Kinnie Laisne of France 63 64. She next faces South Korean Choi Jihee, a 60 76 (75) winner over Emma Laine of Finland. 117 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:08:30.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
