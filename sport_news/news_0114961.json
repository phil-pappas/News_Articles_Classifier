I came up with some good points and great shots and that was the key to the match,\" Pospisil said. \nThe 25-year-old Pospisil held his serve to love in his opening three service games before breaking Giraldo in the tenth game for the opening set. \nAlthough the South American offered a stern resistance in the second, saving four break points in a marathon ten minute sixth game, Pospisil eventually served out the match. \nHe next faces Jeremy Chardy of France or Britain's Aljaz Bedene. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T21:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:02:15.572+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
