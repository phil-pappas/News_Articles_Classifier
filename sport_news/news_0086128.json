Especially in your car.\nThe personable voice of the Apple iPhone is rolling into several makes and dozens of models in the next year, including the 2016 Honda Accord, 2015 Hyundai Sonata, BMW and Ferrari but General Motors is the first automaker...\n(Robert Duffer) \"What we really want, hopefully in the short term, is, we'd like people as they enter their car to be able to have an iPhone experience in their car,\" Cook said. \"I don't know what kind of car you have today. But whatever kind of car it is, the interface in it is probably not (among) the top 10 things you love about the car.\"\nApple could probably buy a carmaker if it wanted.\nBut utility and ease of use got iPhones into not just millions of pockets and purses but millions of lives, so Cook hopes CarPlay can get it into the car. The driver's seat can wait.\n\"CarPlay is being deployed in a number of the largest brands in the business right now,\" he said. \"That's all about trying to make your life outside the car and your life inside the car be seamless.\"\nOf course that was also part of the pitch for the Apple Watch, which Cook insists people who have love and can't do without, despite the fact that few who don't have it feel as though they're missing anything.\nThe idea of a car tethered to the wired world may appeal to many, but some drivers still like the idea of the solitude that comes from getting behind the wheel and getting out on the open road.\nThe rumble of the engine and the air whooshing by can almost make it seem like flying sometimes.\nNo, Siri. Apple cars may not be for everyone.\nMargin call: Thomas Edison invented a workable electric incandescent light 136 years ago Wednesday at his laboratory in Menlo Park, N.J.
