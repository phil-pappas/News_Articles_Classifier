Kansas City's offense was slow to start but kept the line moving against Houston pitching until Kendrys Morales more or less put the Astros away with a big home run late. The Royals defense also played a big factor in their return to the ALCS. \n(FanGraphs) \nWith some help from the win probability data at FanGraphs -- in a nutshell, win probability tells you each team's chances of winning the game at any point based on historical data; it's a stat more for storytelling than hardcore analysis -- here are the pivotal moments from Game 5. \n1. Alex Rios 's two-run double. \nRios didn't have a great regular season by any means, and he had just two postseason hits coming in, but this was great timing against Mike Fiers , who had not pitched in two weeks. Royals go from 62.1 percent to 77.8 likely to win. \n2. Carlos Gomez Lorenzo Cain keeps running. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \n\nThe first huge break of the game for the Royals, happening in the fourth inning. Gomez lost his footing in center on a single by , and Cain hustled into third -- thinking that would be that. But third-base coach Mike Jirschele saw the play develop from the start and, noticing Gomez on his bottom, kept waving Cain home. He scored easily. \n\"I just kept running hard, continuing to hustle into third and when I saw Jirsh waving me, I was kind of confused at first,\" Cain said. \"But I said, â€˜He's our guy.' He's confident in the guys he's sending. I just kept hustling, kept going, ended up scoring easily.\" \n3. 's three-run homer. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \n\nA monstrous put-away clout for a great offseason pickup by general manager Dayton Moore, which made the Royals 99.5 percent likely to win. \n\n4. 's ground-rule double. \nGordon struggled down the stretch in the regular season after coming back from a groin injury, but he's had a few moments in the postseason that indicate he's rounding into form. Trailing by a run in the fifth, win expectancy for the Royals was about 45 percent when Salvador Perez was hit by a pitch a batter to lead off. After Gordon hit a double that hopped over the right-field fence, the Royals were 62 percent favorites -- even though they still trailed on the scoreboard. \n5. Royals can't retire Evan Gattis on infield single. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \n\nMike Moustakas made a strong play to field Gattis's grounder down the third-base line, but he also made an uncharacteristically errant throw that pulled Eric Hosmer off the bag at first. Hosmer tried some fancy footwork in order to complete the play, but he could not hang onto the ball when Gattis run by and knocked it free. It was a tough play, but one the Royals usually make, and it was costly. \nSaid Hosmer: \"You don't want to count yourself out right there, especially the way we've come back this postseason, but I feel that it's a play that should be made on my part. It was tough to swallow right there.\" \n6. Luis Valbuena homers to right on the next pitch. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nThis gave the Astros a 68.8 percent chance of winning, but Houston's offense couldn't get anything more going against Royals right-hander Johnny Cueto , who retired the next and final 19 batters he faced in a dominating performance. \n\"The good version of Johnny Cueto is really tough,\" Astros manager A.J. Hinch. \n\n7. bangs into the right-field fence as he catches the final out. \nAfter suffering a few lapses recently, the Royals mostly played great defense in Game 5, with Orlando putting an exclamation point on the victory by hanging on to George Springer 's drive to right. It was an appropriate way for a team reliant on defense to advance to the ALCS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:18:35.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
