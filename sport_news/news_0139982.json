Rudock is a graduate transfer from Iowa, and both played quarterback for St. Thomas Aquinas in Ft. Lauderdale.\nThe 6-foot-4, 209-pound O'Korn, a pro-style quarterback, has been instrumental on the Wolverines' demonstration team this fall preparing the defense. Earlier this season Jedd Fisch, Michigan's passing game coordinator, said O'Korn has \"confidence and moxie\".\nMastrole said O'Korn is benefiting from living with Rudock, a student of the game and devoted to watching film.\n\"I'm glad the two of them are rooming together,\" Mastrole told The News recently. \"John has off-the-charts physical intangibles, and he's a very smart kid. He's going to pick up things and he's observing Jake.\"\nO'Korn was the American Athletic Conference freshman of the year after throwing for 3,117 yards and 28 touchdowns. But Houston changed offensive coordinators heading into his sophomore year and he lost his job to a more mobile quarterback.\n\"He had some turmoil last year but now he's sitting (this season) and learning a lot,\" Mastrole said. \"Jake has been a good fit for him.\"\nWith Rudock's departure after this season, Michigan's quarterback competition will involve a number of players, including O'Korn, of course. Among the others who will be competing are Shane Morris, who is expected to redshirt this season, Wilton Speight, Alex Malzone, Zach Gentry and incoming freshman Brandon Peters.\nFisch praised O'Korn last month for his confidence and ability.\n\"A strong arm and a really positive, confident player on our football team,\" Fisch said. \"Somebody that really, you can see he's had experience as a starter. He throws a pretty ball.\"\nangelique.chengelis@detroitnews.com\ntwitter.com/chengelis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:51:09.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
