They’ve advanced to the championship with a thrice-to-beat advantage by demolishing every team along the way. The victorious San Beda Red Cubs celebrate by taking a selfie after completing an 18-game sweep of the elimination round of 91st National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Junior Basketball Tournament with a 76-67 victory over the Letran Squires. \nThe Red Cubs completed an 18-game sweep of their elimination assignment at the expense of the Letran Squires, 76-67, Tuesday night at the Arena in San Juan. \nIn reaching the finals, the Red Cubs earned a thrice to beat incentive, and the last they did it was in 2013. \nTheir finals opponent will be determined following a stepladder semifinals and playoffs involving the Mapua Red Robins, the Arellano University Braves, the La Salle Greenhills Greenies and the Lyceum Junior Pirates. \n“Mas higher na ang goal naming ngayon. Kailangan nang paghandaan ang finals,” said San Abuhijle, the team’s Fil-Jordanian skipper whose family now lives in Sta. Rosa, Laguna. \nThree reserve players took charge for the Red Cubs in the game against Letran. Big man Abuhijle emerged as team’s top candidate for the Mythical Five, if not the Most Valuable Player this season. \nFor 18 games, Abuhijle averaged 11.94 points and 9.28 rebounds. \nHe is the team’s no. 1 scorer, but his scoring nowhere near a dangerous Mapua Robins’ top gunners, Michael Enriquez (15.41), Sherwin Concepcion (14.59), Romuel Junsay (13.31) and Jasper Salenga (13.24). \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:52:50.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
