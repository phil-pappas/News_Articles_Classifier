That's all the time the freshman forward needed to score a goal with 2:35 remaining in the second overtime period to give the Matadors (12-2-1) their seventh consecutive victory, 3-2.\"The goal means a lot to me because I hurt my MCL (medial collateral ligament in his knee) in our first game against them [a 3-2 overtime victory for Yavapai in Yuma on Sept. 7],\" said Garcia, who missed the next eight games. \"I had only played one time since then. I just wanted to play tonight. I kept asking the coach [Kenny Dale] to put me in. It's a good thing he did.\" The loss snapped an 11-game unbeaten streak for the Roughriders, who were ranked second in the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) national poll. Yavapai now has a 14-2-1 overall record and 12-2-1 mark in the Arizona Community College Athletic Conference (ACCAC). Arizona Western (12-2-1), ranked No. 11 nationally, moved into a first-place tie with the Roughriders.\"That was a great intercollegiate soccer game,\" Yavapai coach Mike Pantalione said. \"It certainly rivaled anything you'd see at four-year universities. Our team showed a lot of fight from the opening whistle until the end. We're a competitive team. We'll come back.\"That's exactly what the Roughriders did twice against Arizona Western, which held 1-0 and 2-1 leads in the second half before sophomore midfielder Guillermo Diaz capitalized on a perfect pass from freshman defender Juan Ramirez to score his second goal of the game that tied it, 2-2, with 12:19 left in the second half.\"This team works hard no matter what,\" Diaz said. \"We dig deep all the time. They are a strong team that we'll probably see again.\" In September, Arizona Western handed fourth- ranked Pima Community College its only defeat this season.The Matadors nearly won the game 10 minutes later when their leading scorer Jeremiah Egujie's shot hit the right post. The teams traded several scoring opportunities for the first and most of the second overtime periods before Garcia got behind the Yavapai defense to score the winner. After a scoreless first half when Arizona Western outshot Yavapai 10-9, the Roughriders opened the second half with a flurry of shots at goalkeeper Dusan Djordjev, who had allowed only one goal in the Matadors' previous six victories. Djordjev, a freshman from Serbia, had 13 saves, including several spectacular stops at the beginning of the second half.\"[Djordjev] is a quality goalkeeper,\" Pantalione said. \"He was the difference tonight. We moved the ball around and created a lot of scoring opportunities, but he came up big numerous times.\"The visitors took a 1-0 lead at the 57:30 marks when Luis Bobadilla fired a shot that deflected off Yavapai defender Niall Logue's heel into the net.\"That was an 'own goal,'\" Pantalione said. \"Our defense redirected their shot past our goalkeeper. It happens sometimes.\"Yavapai tied the score six minutes later when Miles McCrae headed a corner kick by Reece Weldon that Diaz took in midair and boomed it into the upper right corner of the net.\"That's a play we go over in practice,\" Diaz said. \"We learn to expect the ball at the top of the box [of the penalty area]. It was a great header by Miles.\"Arizona Western executed a nifty play at the 70:16 mark on a corner kick by forward Rex Glenn that defender Jessie Castro headed in mid-air into the Yavapai net for only his second goal of the season. Seven minutes later Diaz tied the score at 2-2. The Roughriders outshot the Matadors, 20-12, in the second half; but Djordjev kept the hosts from gaining the lead.Yavapai goes on the road for four of its final five games of the season starting Saturday, Oct. 10, at Paradise Valley Community College. The Roughriders' last home game of the regular season will be Oct. 17 against Pima CC at Mountain Valley Park.\"A lot of times road games bring us closer,\" Pantalione said. \"The team has set goals and objectives. It's a process. We have a lot of soccer left.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:43:55.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
