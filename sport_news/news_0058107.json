They are first so they are the favourites, I think,” van Gaal told reporters today. \n“If we win, we are first in the table. That doesn’t mean we are the champions. That’s decided in May. \n“It’s a big step when we win but still you have to continue.” \nVan Gaal acknowledged that Sunday’s derby is bigger than the average United league match, but he is determined to ensure he does not get caught up in the emotion of the occasion. \n“For me, it’s not an issue. I have to do my work. And I have to do it more rationally and not emotionally,” he said. \n“I think for the fans, it’s very emotional. I live in a little village and it is also the talk of the town there. But in Manchester, it’s more.” \nSlow start \nPellegrini has won three of his four derbies as City manager, two in his first season against a United side then led by David Moyes. \nVan Gaal, who suffered a 1-0 league defeat at Eastlands last November, has won the most recent meeting between the two teams, though, with a 4-2 victory at Old Trafford in April. \nThe former Netherlands boss has rejected suggestions that that win was his finest moment since joining United in July 2014, saying that his team’s slow start that day disappointed him. \n“No, it was certainly not my best moment, because we started badly in that match,” he added. \n“Of course, we won but it cost us a lot of energy. We played better matches last year.” \nUnited have arguably had a tougher week than City, having had to travel to Russia for a midweek Champions League draw against CSKA Moscow. \nCity were at home to Sevilla, winning 2-1 courtesy of a last-minute Kevin De Bruyne winner and Van Gaal hopes United’s long journey to Russia doesn’t have a negative effect on Sunday. \n“I hope that we have recovered. We have done everything to help the recovery of the players,” he said. \n“We stayed in a hotel the next day. We had a smooth flight, then we went to the training complex for recovery. \n“We haven’t trained too much today. We have to recover because it is a match at a high level. We have to cope with that.” — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:33:02.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
