Coliseum, both Utah prepsters were playing for the USC Trojans against their home state school.\nNeither started the game, but both played substantial minutes for the Trojans in their decisive 42-24 victory over the Utes and were thrilled to come away as victors.\n“For sure I’ve got a lot of Utah fans talking trash to me all week and I’m going to go hit them up after this,’’ said Gustin after the game. “It’s nice, that loss to Notre Dame really fired us up so we had a good week of practice and we came out physical.’’\nFor Masina, the win was special because it gave him family bragging rights since his older brother, Uaea, is a backup linebacker for the Utes, who played substantial minutes and came up with four tackles.\n“We didn’t get to go head to head, but it was definitely an experience, seeing him on the field, not playing with him, but against him,’’ said Osa. “It was fun. The main thing tonight was getting a W.’’\nComing into the game, Masina ranked sixth on the team in tackles, with a fumble recovery for a touchdown in the first game against Arkansas State. Gustin had 13 tackles including three for loss with two sacks.\nBoth players were on the field for the Trojans at the start of the second quarter, Gustin at outside linebacker and Masina at inside linebacker. Both were credited with one tackle in the game.\nAs for his decision to come to USC instead of Utah, Osa Masina said, “I love it here, wouldn’t trade it for anything.’’", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-boxscores.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/results/2015-2016/boxscore48670.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team71.html"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:31:04.347+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
