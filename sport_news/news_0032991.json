He was scheduled to be placed under house arrest in August, but South African justice minister Michael Masutha ruled that Pistorius remain in prison until this month. \nAccording to a Guardian story published in August , Pistorius’s house arrest won’t exactly be a taxing punishment: \nHe is expected to stay at his uncle Arnold’s three-storey mansion in a wealthy suburb of Pretoria. He is likely to be allowed to leave the house to work, carry out community service or to attend important family events, and officials say he will not have to wear an electronic monitoring device. \nProsecutors in the case have appealed the judge’s ruling in the case, saying she incorrectly applied South African law in making her decision and that Pistorius deliberately killed Steenkamp. The first hearing about their appeal will take place Nov. 3, with prosecutors asking for a murder conviction and a stronger sentence.
