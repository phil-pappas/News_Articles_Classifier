Romar acknowledged Washington is a bit of a mystery because the team had nine players leave the program in the past year due to graduation, transfer or dismissal. \nEven though the Huskies bring in a heralded recruiting class that’s ranked among the top 10 in the country, they return just two players (senior guard Andrew Andrews and sophomore wing Donaven Dorsey) who were in the rotation last season and must integrate seven freshmen and one junior-college transfer.\n“It’s good,” Andrews said with a wry smile. “Less expectations are better. We can catch people by surprise.”\nIt’s been almost two weeks since the Huskies began practicing Oct. 3 and Andrews has been impressed with how quickly the newcomers are learning the system.\n“This has been the quickest learning I’ve seen since I’ve been here,” he said. “I’m more vocal now than I was (in summer workouts). Just pointing out little things and getting them used to how it’ll be in the game.” \nRomar also complimented the newcomers, particularly freshmen Dejounte Murray and Marquese Chriss.\nChriss, who fractured his right wrist during a summer workout, sat out UW’s first three practices, but began working out with the team last week.\nHis right hand is bandaged, which has forced the 6-foot-9, 225-pound forward to rely solely on his left hand. Romar said he believes Chriss will be fully recovered before UW’s Nov. 13 opener against Texas in Shanghai, China.\n“Everybody is coming into their own, but the most impressive thing I’ve seen is Marquese,” Andrews said. “He fractured his right hand and in a matter of a week he’s playing and practicing fully with his left hand. That’s going to help him in the long run.”\nWith the exception of Andrews, Romar hasn’t decided on a starting lineup or set a rotation. \nAndrews, UW’s leading returning scorer who averaged 15.0 points last season, represented the Huskies at the Pac-12 media day Thursday.\nAside from the being picked next-to-last in the preseason poll, he enjoyed touring the conference headquarters and sharing the stage with the league’s top players and coaches.\n“When it’s all said and done, the people who (picked UW 11th) will probably take it back,” Andrews said.\nRomar expects the preseason poll will send a message to the Huskies.\n“I’m sure it’ll come up, but we need to have more internal motivation,” he said. “If your only motivation is coming from that, it’s going to be pretty shallow.”\nHuskies in preseason polls A look at where the Huskies have been picked in the Pac-12 preseason media poll and how they’ve fared under coach Lorenzo Romar.
