His slide-rule pass picked out Ozil, who was brought down by a diving challenge from Craig Cathcart. Before the referee could point to the penalty spot, Chile forward Sanchez had lashed the loose ball in off the far post for his 10th goal in six appearances for club and country. \nBefore Watford could mount a recovery, Arsenal had doubled their lead. \nOzil was again involved, cutting a deflected pass back through the six-yard box where Giroud, who had only just replaced Walcott, swept the ball into the roof of the net on 68 minutes. \nRamsey - on target for Wales in their midweek Euro 2016 qualifier against Andorra - finally got back on the Arsenal goal trail when he tapped home a deflected effort, off defender Ikechi Anya, following a darting run down the right by Hector Bellerin in the 73rd minute. \nTWEET OF THE MATCH \n\"Game of 2 halves: one awful, one terrific. But overall, an excellent away win. #afc\" \n- Piers Morgan @piersmorgan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T21:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:10:37.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
