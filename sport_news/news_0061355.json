The Patriots (5-0) received nine first-place votes and 381 points in balloting by the 12 media members who regularly cover the league. \nThe complete poll can be found here. \nNew York improved to 4-1 after its 34-20 win over Washington and improved two spots. Under first-year coach Todd Bowles, the Jets and their defense could be a formidable foe for Tom Brady and the Patriots. \n\"Todd Bowles has the Jets off to a remarkable start, as they've already equaled last year's win total,\" Newsday's Bob Glauber said. \nAnd, adds NBC's Tony Dungy, \"Now they'll have their chance to do it against the Patriots.\" \nGreen Bay and Cincinnati remained 2-3, both with 6-0 records. The Packers had three first-place votes and 368 points, six points ahead of the Bengals. Carolina (5-0), which won at Seattle, moved up three places to fourth, followed by Denver (6-0), the lowest ranked of the unbeatens after an overtime win against Cleveland. \n\"Peyton Manning still is not right -- in fact, this could be it for the future Hall of Fame quarterback,\" Glauber said. \"... It's that Denver defense that's powering the Broncos' unbeaten start.\" \nFormer coach Herm Edwards of ESPN moved Carolina up a few notches to fifth on his ballot. \n\"That was the most impressive win of Week 6, coming back against Seattle,\" Edwards said. \nThe Packers, Bengals and Broncos have byes this week. The other unbeatens play at home -- Jets at Patriots and Eagles and Broncos. \nIn interim coach Dan Campbell's first game, the Miami Dolphins (2-3) routed Tennessee and made the biggest move with a 10-spot jump to No. 20 following a 38-10 rout of Tennessee. \nAfter their first loss of the season, the Atlanta Falcons fell four spots to ninth, while Baltimore (1-5) and Tennessee (1-4) each tumbled four places, to 29th and 31st, respectively. \nOther notable changes include defending NFC champion Seattle (2-4) down five to No. 15 and Jacksonville (1-5) back at No. 32. \n\"Fourth-quarter woes continue (for Seattle),\" Fox Sports' John Czarnecki said. \nAs for the Jaguars, \"Get some ice on the arm of Blake Bortles,\" the Dallas Morning News' Rick Gosselin said. \"Quarterbacks have thrown 50 passes in a dozen games this season and only Bortles has done it twice.\" \nPhoto: Tony Tribble for Local12.com \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
