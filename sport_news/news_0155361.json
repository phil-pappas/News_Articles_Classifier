Forward Gets Her Groove Back Mike Libert Talk about it in the nychoops Message Boards Nearing back to 100%, 5'11\" forward Mikaiya Moore (Copiague '16) is ready to show to everyone that she is not just back to the player she was before she tore her ACL last fall, but she is now even better.There was some doubt as to where Moore would be playing her H.S. ball in this her senior season, but Moore has decided to stay at Copiague, in part because she feels there is unfinished business there that she wants to take care of after missing her entire junior season.\"I know there will be some pressure, but I think as a team this year we can fight through whatever we have to get through and make it to the top again,\" Moore stated. \"That is my goal.\"It is her goal to help Copiague win a Long Island County Championship and having become a more versatile player, Moore looks like she just may be able to help her squad reach the top of the mountain.Having been forced to play on the outside for much of the summer as to not re-injure her knee, Moore has become an inside/outside threat like she never was before.Always looked at as a dangerous weapon around the basket before the injury, Moore has become a great set shooter who can also put the ball on the floor and make a move going to the rim, really throwing defenses off on how to defend her.Moore says she is much more comfortable now posting up and making a move pushing off her now recovered right leg, and her AAU coach with New Heights, Chez Williams , says that it is going to be scary to see how Moore will dominate out on Long Island this season.\"She is probably at 95%, and will be 100% come the start of the season,\" Williams said. \"Mikaiya is such a smart player that she is going to make adjustments on how defenses guard her this season and she will hurt them from both the inside and the outside for sure.\"While her game is fully back in the eyes of both Moore and Williams, it has taken colleges a bit of time to return to her after the injury, but they seem to be back on board now too. Williams says that both Hofstra and LIU-Brooklyn are heavily recruiting her, while Moore herself says that a number of others are also starting to come after her as well as her play starts to round into form.\" Stony Brook has called me a lot, and I have heard from FDU and Brown as well,\" Moore admitted.It may have taken longer because of her injury and missed time, but Moore says that she hopes her work ethic and improvements since the injury are showing coaches that she will never let anything from achieving her goals. Williams though, he believes coaches are still taking the wait and see attitude, though he says he believes that is going to change very, very soon.\"Yeah it's a wait and see thing, but when they see it, she is going to have a lot of colleges wanting her because she is that good.\" FEATURED PRODUCTS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T00:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:51:09.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
