Did somebody switch off offensive coordinator Cam Cameron's headset at halftime?: Cameron may have called one of his most diverse quarters in his three years as the Tigers' O-coordinator when LSU dropped 28 points and 233 yards on Florida in the second quarter. He turned quarterback Brandon Harris loose, with the strong-slinging sophomore completing 7-of-8 for 148 yards and two TDs to Malachi Dupre of 9 and 50 yards. Cameron even dialed up a flea-flicker with Leonard Fournette getting a handoff, taking several steps towards the line and then flipped in back to Harris who threw a 52-yard pass to Dupre.\nBut after the Tigers led 28-14 at halftime, LSU ran the ball 22 of 29 plays in the second half, hoping its usual play-it-safe philosophy would get it across the finish line. It did. Barely.\n2. Herschel Fournette: Leonard Fournette, for just the second time this season, didn't bust a long touchdown run for the Tigers. His longest run was 25 yards, but his 30 carries for 180 yards and two TDs were reminiscent of how Herschel Walker, the SEC's all-time leading rusher, would carry Georgia's team on his back in the early 1980s. Fournette's 12-yard run in the latter part of the fourth quarter that got LSU a first down and some breathing room after Florida downed a punt on the LSU 1, may have been Fournette's best run of the night.\n3. Maybe LSU should stop punting and only use squib kickoffs: For the second straight year against Florida and the second straight game, LSU's kick coverage team gave up a touchdown. Last week against South Carolina, the Tigers allowed a TD kickoff return. Against Florida, the Gators' Antonio Callaway jetted 72 yards on a TD punt return that tied the game at 28-28 with 1:04 left. Also, LSU punt returner Tre'Davious White fumbled Florida's first punt of the game and the Gators cashed in for the game's first TD.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:13:47.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
