The Tigers have been ranked the Associated Press poll exactly twice, each time for one week: Last season’s final poll and a one-week stay in 2004. And each time, they never ascended past No. 25. \nThat is going to change. \nLed by Coach Justin Fuente, who is almost certainly is going to land a Power 5 job after this season, the Tigers roared back from a 14-0 first-quarter deficit to rip through 13th-ranked Ole Miss, 37-24 . Memphis upsets No. 13 Ole Miss 37-24, after trailing 14-0. @MemphisFB leads the FBS with 4 double-digit comeback wins this season. \n[ All hail Memphis Megaphone Man ] \nQuarterback Paxton Lynch completed 38 of 53 passes for 382 yards and three touchdowns for Memphis, which is now 6-0. Ten of those completions and one of the touchdowns went to Anthony Miller, who finished with 132 receiving yards. \nSuddenly, the American Athletic Conference is looking like a thing this year. Houston is also 6-0 and ranked No. 24, while Temple is 5-0 (the Owls face horrid Central Florida on Saturday night). And let’s not forget about 4-1 Navy, whose only loss is to Notre Dame. The Tigers face the Midshipmen on Nov. 7, the Cougars on Nov. 14 and then the Owls one week later, with another possible matchup against Temple in the AAC title game on Dec. 5.
