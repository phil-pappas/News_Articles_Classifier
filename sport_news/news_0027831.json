Joe Zanolli, who's already in our Hall of Fame, led Western Mass. with 19 goals. Commerce scored 37 and allowed only 13,\" Mindell said. \nThis will mark the first year for team inductions into the Public Schools Sports Hall of Fame. \nCommerce also will be represented by its 1976-77-78 boys basketball teams, which won three straight state championships. They went 72-6, including a 26-0 record in 1977 and a 36-game winning streak over two seasons. Those Red Raiders were coached by Mike Martin, now athletic director for the city schools and chairman of the Hall of Fame committee. \nUntil Commerce, no Springfield basketball team had won a state title. \nFALCON WATCH: The Springfield Falcons roster includes seven draft picks of their new parent club, the Arizona Coyotes. Three were drafted in the second round - center Laurent Dauphin of Repentigny, Quebec, in 2013; left wing Lucas Lessio of Maple, Ont., in 2011; and right wing Phil Lane of Rochester, N.Y., in 2010. \nThe other Arizona draftees skating with the Falcons are left wing Michael Bunting of Scarborough, Ont., No. 4 in 2014; goaltender Marek Langhamer of Moravska Trebova, Czech Republic, No. 7 in 2012; right wing Jordan Szwarz of Burlington, Ont., No. 4 in 2009; and defenseman Justin Hache of Bathurst, N.B., No. 7 in 2008. \nArizona's top picks in the last two drafts - center Dylan Strome (2015) and forward Brendan Perlini (2014) are still in junior hockey. \nThe Falcons play their next home game Friday, Oct. 23, against Wilkes-Barre. \nREMEMBERING RIZZO: In the summer of 2010, the Brown family went to New Britain to see the Portland Sea Dogs, a Boston Red Sox farm club, play the Rock Cats in an Eastern League game. The day's highlight was a moonshot home run off the bat of Anthony Rizzo, Portland's first baseman. \nIn 2007, Rizzo had been drafted and signed by Red Sox general manager Theo Epstein. In December of 2010, despite Rizzo's power potential, Epstein traded him to San Diego for first baseman Adrian Gonzalez. \nAfter a disastrous 2011 season, Epstein bolted the Red Sox in October to become general manager of the Chicago Cubs. In January of 2012, he made another deal with San Diego - for Rizzo. \nNow, Rizzo ranks as a major power threat for the Cubs as they square off against the New York Mets in the National League Championship Series. \nWILLEY'S WEEKEND: In the 1950s, Ed Willey starred as a pitcher for Chester High School and American International College. \nToday, he roams the outfield for the Western Mass. Relics, a slo-pitch softball organization for players 60 and up. \nLast weekend, Willey went on a spree at the plate - 10 hits in 12 trips over four games - as the Relics played in the 75 Division of the Cape Cod Classic, an annual October event in Harwich. \nThe Relics went 1-3 in the tournament, which drew 1,300 players in five age groups. \nCHICOPEE CHUCKER: Dan Dulchinos, retired after a 639-victory career as Chicopee Comp's baseball coach, well remembers Jack Hurst, a hard-throwing pitcher in the post-World War II era. \n\"Jack pitched in the Chicopee City League, and later for the Holyoke Allies in Tri-County. He had good stuff, threw hard,\" Dulchinos said. \nHurst pitched and played the outfield for Chicopee High, graduating in 1943. One of his teammates, Norm \"Hooks\" Cournoyer, became a pitching rival of his in later years. \nAfter WWII service in the Navy and Marine Corps, Hurst graduated from AIC. He played two seasons of minor league ball, in the Detroit organization. \nJack Hurst passed away Oct. 9. He was 90 years old. \nBEST BET for the weekend: Coffee Clique, in the Athenia Stakes at Belmont. \nGarry Brown can be reached at geebrown1918@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T23:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:28:43.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
