Quite frankly — for the second straight week — it couldn’t afford to. \nWith No. 7 South Dakota State coming to town on Saturday, the YSU defense is preparing for two dynamic quarterbacks: strong-armed junior Zach Lujan — the Missouri Valley Football Conference’s top passer — and dual-threat freshman Taryn Christion, who burst onto the scene last week as the MVFC Newcomer of the Week. \nThe No. 11 Penguins (3-2, 1-1) faced a similar situation heading into Saturday’s loss against Illinois State, as the Redbirds used two quarterbacks – one a passer (Tyler Kolbe), the other a dual-threat (Tre Roberson). So while the YSU defense has some extra studying to do this week, it’s not a new drill. \n“We prepared for both quarterbacks last week and we’ll prepare for both quarterbacks this week,” senior defense tackle Steve Zaborsky said. “I think we’ll have enough time getting after it. It really helps we start on Sunday’s and we’re really able to look at the film and analyze everything.” \nThrough the first four contests, Lujan threw nine TDs and tossed for a conference-best 311 yards per game. However, he injured his ankle in a Week 4 loss to North Dakota State, opening the door for Christion. \nThe 18-year-old wasn’t shy, totaling 320 yards of total offense as the Jackrabbits (4-1, 1-1) downed Indiana State, 24-7. Christion went 15-of-24 for 221 yards and a TD, while he rushed for 99 yards and a TD on 16 attempts. \nOn Tuesday, SDSU coach John Stiegelmeier said he’s unsure of who his starting QB will be at Stambaugh Stadium, adding that it will depend on how Lajon’s ankle responds in practice later in the week. \n“I don’t know who we’re gonna play — it seems to be the reoccurring theme around here,” YSU coach Bo Pelini said. “You don’t really know what to expect, so you have to be ready for a lot of different things and you have to be prepared to adjust on the fly.” \nZaborsky said preparing for those adjustments can be time-consuming. \n“We have certain calls for when one of them is in, so just separating the variables and keeping them distinctly defined makes it a lot simpler,” he said. “That’s how we deal with it. It does add time, but as long as we have the focus and mentally ability to handle all that — which I think we do — it makes it a lot easier to compensate for.” \nEven after allowing 24 points to Illinois State’s offense last week, the Penguins are ranked fourth in total defense and first in pass defense in the FCS. Still, they struggled at times against ISU’s Roberson, who passed for 130 yards and a TD and ran for 90 yards and score. \nIn turn, it wouldn’t be a surprise for SDSU to use Christion — the same style QB as Roberson — quite extensively, even if Lajon is healthy enough to start. \n“You only got so may hours in a day, but it’s one of those things you have to prepare for,” Pelini said. “It’s just part of the deal. ... You have to prepare a little bit more.” \nFraser to start again \nSophomore Cameron Fraser is slated to get his third straight start at left tackle in place of senior Trevor Strickland. \nWhile Pelini said Strickland’s status remains the same as last week — which was questionable with “personal issues” before not appearing against ISU — it’s likely he won’t be available once again. For the first time all season, Fraser was listed as the starter on the depth-chart, with Strickland sliding into the backup slot. \n“I thought [Fraser] made progress last week,” Pelini said. “I thought he got better than he was the week before. Hopefully it continues to happen that way.” Other stories of interest", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:03:00.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
