Not only that, the Monarchs had the look of a team determined to earn one for the thumb this year. In a dominating performance on both sides of the line and perhaps their best game of the year, the Monarchs slugged out a 29-6 victory over Croatan, claiming their 16th straight win over the Cougars and snapping their six-game winning streak. It was also the 26th straight ECC win for the Monarchs. “We turned up the intensity,” said 6-foot-3, 290-pound sophomore defensive tackle and offensive guard Maurice McIntyre, who had two stops for minus-3 and -4 yards on 1,000-yard rusher Sam Nay on Croatan’s first two possessions to help set the tone early. “We’ve been undefeated for like four years. We ain’t going to let this title go so easy without a fight.” Northside (6-2, 2-0) outmuscled the Cougars (6-2, 1-1) up front in a battle of two teams who pride themselves on being physical. On this night, there was no question who won that battle in this key early season ECC battle. “They were the more physical team,” Croatan coach David Perry said. “I thought we were going to have a great game, but we didn’t seem to have the edge tonight that we’ve had the last few games. Hat’s off to them. They played lights out. They came out and pounded the football. “I feel like that had to be one of their better games. From what I’ve seen on film, that looked as good as I’ve seen them the last couple of years, to be honest. They looked really good tonight and very physical. I think they played up to the game and maybe we didn’t.” Northside coach Bob Eason smiled when asked about how well his team played, especially up front. “We tried to make it a little personal, their big guys vs. our big guys, and we’ll see who wins,” Eason said. “Defensively, I could tell you it was our best game. Even though we shut out Dixon (27-0 last week), Croatan had a good game plan and we felt like we played some pretty solid defense.” Croatan junior running back Sam Nay, who came in with 1,024 yards rushing, bulled for 135 yards, including a 6-yard touchdown with 6:40 left, but the Monarchs made him work for it. He carried 32 times. Meanwhile, Northside’s backs, behind a line that more often than not had its way with the Cougars, seemed time and again to go untouched inside or outside until they’d gained 4 or 5 yards. Only twice was Northside held for negative yards, one coming on a 9-yard loss on a sack. Page 2 of 3 - Jonte McMullen rushed for 97 yards on 11 carries, including a 12-yard touchdown run, while Dwayne Washington, who is nursing a sore hamstring, ground out 78 yards on 15 carries. He scored on a 3-yard run. One reason for the strong performance likely was Northside had found its bearings after learning last week it likely would have to forfeit its first four wins (all nonconference) because of an ineligible player. The school is still waiting a final ruling from the NCHSAA. “Last week was distracting,” Eason said. “We had better practices this week.” Northside set the tone early. With Croatan facing second-and-13 at its 16-yard line, defensive back Malachi Laws picked off Tommy Clark’s pass at the Croatan 43. After a 31-yard run by Washington, McMullen bulled up the middle for the touchdown and then added the two-point conversion for an 8-0 lead with 8:16 left. Croatan, which ran 61 plays to Northside’s 40 and had at least one first down on all but two possessions (one of which came at the end of the first half), got two first downs on its next series before punting. Northside then put together a 12-play, 79-yard drive in which it converted three third downs before scoring on quarterback Jake Erickson’s 1-yard sneak on third-and-goal to make it 16-0 after Washington’s run for the two-point conversion with 10:23 left in the second quarter. “The two quick touchdowns hurt,” Perry said. “That got us in a bad position.” It didn’t get any better for the Cougars, who finished with 195 yards total offense to 255 for Northside. After Rashawn Canady returned the second half kickoff 47 yards to the Croatan 22, the Monarchs made it 23-0 on a 3-yard run by Washington. Croatan picked up two first downs on its ensuing possession but came up 2 yards short on fourth-and-8 at the Northside 43, and the Monarchs responded with a quick drive that featured a 21-yard pass from Erickson to Thomas McCaskill and then a 15-yard toss to Jireh Wilson for a 29-0 lead with 1:04 left in the third quarter. The only question at that point was whether Northside could shut the Cougars out. But Croatan avoided that on Nay’s touchdown run that capped a 16-play, 76-yard drive. Nonetheless, it was a performance worthy of a team looking to win its fifth straight ECC title. “We had to come in straight focus because of all the drama (with the likely forfeits) that’s been going on,” McIntyre said. “Croatan had a big head. I think they’re 6-1, high ranked, but we’ve been undefeated in this conference. So we have to show them who we are.” Croatan 0 0 0 6 — 6Northside 8 8 13 0 — 29 Page 3 of 3 - First Quarter NS – McMullen 12 run (McMullen run), 8:16 Second Quarter NS – Erickson 1 run (Washington run), 10:23 Third Quarter NS – Washington 3 run (Reyes kick), 9:02 NS – Wilson 15 pass from Erickson (kick failed), 1:04 Fourth Quarter C – Nay 6 run (kick failed), 6:40 C N First downs 13 12Rushes-yards 50-177 34-202Passing 18 53Comp-Att-Int 3-11-2 5-6-0Punts 1-32.0 3-31.3Fumbles-Lost 0-0 1-1Penalties-Yards 1-5 3-25 INDIVIDUAL STATISTICS RUSHING—C: Nay 32-135, Bridges 13-36, Clark 2-4, Lehotta 2-1, Waltrip 1-1.
