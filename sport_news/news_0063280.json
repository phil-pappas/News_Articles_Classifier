In this week’s Getting to Know, Lawson explains why he’s a math and science “nerd,” one thing people do not know about him and why he’s into architecture.\nLawson has 428 tackles, 23.5 sacks and 21 pass break-ups in a career that’s taken him through San Francisco, Cincinnati and Buffalo.\nWhere did you grow up? Goldsboro, N.C. It’s country as country can be. Small town. Not that many people there.\nWhat did you get into as a kid? After-school programs and sports, mostly. I played football, basketball, baseball, ran track, a lot of things.\nYou’re obviously a physical specimen today, but what led to the guy who jumps out of a gym and runs the 40 time that you do? I really don’t know. I’m blessed with good genes and really that’s it because I was never always the biggest guy on the field but had the will, the want-to and enjoyed the game and love playing sports.\nWhat did your parents do sports-wise? My dad, he ran track and played high school football. My mom, she ran track.\nSo what do you like to do in your free time here in Western New York? Mostly, it’s watching movies. Anything that gets me off of my feet and relaxing.\nAny good ones lately? The last one I saw was the “Age of Ultron,” the Avengers movie. I’m kind of behind right now, so I have to play catch-up. I’m a huge Marvel Comics guy. I love the Iron Mans, the Incredible Hulks, the Superman movies.\nWere you a comic book kid growing up? Never was a comic book guy. But I was a Ninja Turtles guy.\nWho was your inspiration as a kid, someone you looked up to? I’d really have to say it was my dad because my parents were divorced. They were divorced at an early age when I was 8. And he raised two kids on his own. Kept us straight in line, kept us in our school books and was always there for us when he could be. Even when he was struggling at times to have that family bonding time, he would make time for us.\nIs there a message of his that you always come back to, even to this day? The one thing that he said to me – I remember it to this day and I was in high school at the time – is “I’m the same man making the same amount of money, just watch how God blesses our lives and changes our lives.” Not too long after that, I ended up getting a football scholarship and things took off from there. My sister’s a psychiatrist, so she’s well off.\nIn your 10th season, what’s the key to lasting so long? Really, it’s just understanding what my role is and what my job is, to know exactly what to do in a certain situation and to take care of yourself.\nYou’ve always been a smart, intellectual guy – do you have any different type of interests outside of the game? Not too much. I’m a huge science and math nerd. I love the Discovery Channel and anything to do with science on TV. I’m fascinated by how things work, what makes them work, the molecules that make everything tick. There’s something about that, that intrigues me. So definitely the Discovery Channel. A little bit of the History Channel but not too much.\nWhat’s your favorite show on the Discovery Channel? Anything where it’s the animal kingdom, or when they go back in prehistoric history and track dinosaurs and how the world and life became of. The one I saw that was really intriguing was “Man vs. Nature.” Yeah, that’s something I would never do. No, no, no. I’ll watch it from afar. I don’t want to be in it.\nWhat’s one thing people don’t know about you? I was born with six fingers on one hand. Seriously. Right there, it protruded right out of my pinkie. Any time I wiggled that, it’d move too. They ended up tying a string around it when I was real young, let the nerves die out and then chopped it off.\nNever heard of that before. How long did you have the sixth finger? I didn’t have it long at all. Right after birth, right then and there, it got dealt with. String. Let it droop and die. And then just cut it off.\nEver wish you had a sixth finger today on there? It’d definitely be a distraction if you see someone waving at you, they’re counting and they see you have six fingers. Yeah, that’d be distracting. It’d be interesting but I can see how it’d get in the way. So no complaints.\nHave you ever heard of that before? A couple family members of mine had that trait. Other than that, no.\nWhat kind of music do you like? A little bit of everything – rap, hip-hop, R&B, a little bit of country, rock, heavy metal. It depends on what my mood is and what I’m getting ready for.\nBefore a game, what are you listening to? Some rock, some rap, heavy metal. Those three genres.\nIs there one song that gets you jacked? “Let the Bodies Hit the Floor” by Drowning Pool. Definitely. That’s my end-all. As we’re getting ready to walk out, that’s the last song playing in my head.\nWhat about that song gets you in the right mind frame to play? It’s got to be the counting of the bodies hitting the floor, from the drums to the guitars – just the beat and the melody of it – it really gets me into it.\nIf you weren’t a football player what would you be doing? I’d like to say I’d be an architect. Architecture was the reason I chose N.C. State. The studio hours and our practice times conflicted so I ended up choosing something else. But I’m going to see if I can get myself back into that. I still love the idea of constructing a home. Maybe somebody will like it, maybe they won’t. But it’s a possibility.\nWhat about architecture intrigued you? It’s really about how something can start off on paper – an idea. An idea comes to mind of “Let’s do this, let’s do that.” And then there’s the work behind it. You have to start off with a foundation and make sure the ground is level and then you build it up into the stadium we play in today.\nSo you got into football and couldn’t keep it going? Yeah, it’s tough to go back to that knowing I still had to complete studio hours. This time here, I really dedicate to football.\nWhen you’re driving around Buffalo, do you study the architecture? Oh yeah, I especially love how it changes from the old-school designs to the new-school designs. You’ll be driving through a section and you’ll see they probably renovated it but didn’t want to change it. They wanted to hold onto the history behind it. When you drive a little bit further, you can see the modernization that’s coming.\nLooking around, what’s your take on the changes in the city? There’s both. Buffalo has a history and you can see how it’s changing and that’s exciting because I think change is good but also you can’t lose track of where you came from.\nemail: tdunne@buffnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:11:07.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
