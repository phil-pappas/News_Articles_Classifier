North Florida knocked off top-seeded Lipscomb, 3-0 to advance to its second-straight A-Sun Tournament Championship game. The Ospreys scored all three goals in first 24 minutes of the contest and capped off three-game run, outscoring their opponents 12-0. Last Time Out: Sunday's 2-1 victory over Georgia Southern on Sunday night was the fourth win of the season and improved the Ospreys to 3-1 at home. Junior Milan Kovacs broke the 1-1 tie and was credited with his second game-winning goal of the season in the 78 th minute. Kovacs now leads the team with three goals and six points. Series History: The all-time series between Lipscomb and North Florida is all tied up at 5-5-1. The Ospreys haven't come away with a victory in the regular season against the Bisons since 2012, a 3-2 victory in double overtime. In games in Nashville the Ospreys are 3-2-1 against Lipscomb since the series began in 2005. About Lipscomb: The Bisons come into Saturday's game already with a 1-0 record in A-Sun play thanks to a 3-0 triumph at USC upstate on Wednesday. Lipscomb kept the high-powered Spartan offense in check and recorded their A-Sun leading, third shutout of the season. The Bisons attack is led by Logan Paynter who netted his fourth goal of the season against USC Upstate earlier this week. The defending regular season champions return the 2014 Freshman of the Year in Ivan Alvarado and First Team All-Conference selection, Matt Kerridge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:23:12.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
