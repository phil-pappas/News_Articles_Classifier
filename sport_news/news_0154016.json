They’re on the way home. New Bedford native Travis Scott and his wife Joanne, whose travels around the world aboard their refurbished 38-foot Chris Craft sailboat Calico Jack we’ve been chronicling in the Standard-Times since they left Florida in December 2012, are in the Caribbean at anchor in Man o’ War Bay in Charlotteville on the island of Tobago. It’s been quite a ride. Let’s start with their more recent travels: After leaving the Indian Ocean and stopping for some inland tourism in South Africa, Calico Jack took off again, crossing the South Atlantic — with stops along the way at the islands of St. Helena and Ascension. Ascension Island was a favorite stop for sailors and the whalers out of New Bedford, Nantucket and other ports during the 19th century. In St. Helena, there is a monument to Joshua Slocum, who stopped there in 1899 on his famous solo circumnavigation. The Scotts arrived in Brazil at Fernando de Noronha, a UNESCO World Heritage site, then continued on to mainland South America, landing in French Guiana. In French Guiana, they helped a friend build a new marina, staying longer than planned, which affected their plans for riding out the hurricane season. While helping his friend lay out a new mooring field, Travis rescued a dog from drowning in a river current, and the dog rewarded him with a bite, leaving Travis to undergo a regimen of rabies vaccinations before they moved on from South America. Calico Jack stopped off at the Ile du Salut, famous as “Devil’s Island,” the penal colony where Papillion was incarcerated. Later, the Scotts moved to the Kourou River, where they toured the European Space Center and observed the Ariane 5 rocket launch. From there, they sailed up the coast to the Maroni River, finishing up in St. Laurent, another former French penal colony. The hardy duo crossed to neighboring Suriname, spending another week-and-a-half there. Then, they headed off to Guyana, traveling 40 nautical miles up the Esequibo River to the old mining town of Bartica. Barticans see only a dozen or so boats a year, making this one of the last places Calico Jack would travel in relative quiet before returning to the overcrowded anchorages of the Caribbean. “While we did enjoy our time in the Guyanas,” wrote Travis, “...we were getting tired of muddy, brown water and muddy-tasting fish.” So the pair set their sights on the blue waters of the Caribbean, sailing 350 nautical miles to Tobago, a sister island to Trinidad. “Our original plans had us staying here for only a week or so before continuing on towards Curacao,” wrote Travis, “But we fell in love with it, and decided to spend most of hurricane season here.” Calico Jack landed in Charlotteville, a small fishing village on the northeast corner of the island. While there is not much to do in “town,” the couple spent time on a beautiful beach in Pirates Bay, with clear blue warm water to swim in, and coral reefs to snorkel and dive among. “We befriended a local who takes us out on his boat a few times a week to dive for lobsters or go spearfishing, so our freezer is well-stocked with fresh seafood these days,” wrote Travis. Currently, Calico Jack is at rest in Tobago. The pair sailed to the west end of the island to check it out and meet up with friends. The western portion of Tobago proved to be more touristy, but provided the Scotts with not only a change of scenery, but the opportunity to re-provision and pick up their friends at the airport. Next week, we’ll retrace Calico Jack’s steps from the Indian Ocean down to South Africa, where Joanne finally got to go hiking and on safari, 15 years after she had originally planned a trip there.
