Odom was first brought to Desert View Hospital but then immediately transported by Pahrump Valley Fire and Rescue Ambulance to Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas for further treatment. \nNye County Sheriff’s Office Detectives Cory Fowles and Michael Eisenloffel conducted an investigation on scene. \nLove Ranch owner Dennis Hof says neither he nor his staff saw any illegal drugs at the scene, but says they did see \"an herbal Viagra. And [Odom] was taking a lot of those.\" \nOdom, 35, last played in the NBA in 2013. That same year, he was arrested for DUI, to which he pleaded no contest. Later that month, Khloé Kardashian, his wife of five years, filed for divorce amid reports of Odom's infidelity and substance abuse. Their divorce was finalized in July of this year. \n\"He doesn't think we are going through with the divorce,\" Kardashian said in 2014. \"[He says] I'll always be his wife and he'll never call me anything else.\" \nAccording to a recent clip from Keeping Up with the Kardashians , Odom was still in touch with his ex-spouse. E! Online reports Kardashian is \"completely inconsolable,\" and was expected to fly from Los Angeles to Las Vegas to be at Odom's bedside. \nEarlier this year, Odom suffered another setback when his best friend, Jamie Sangouthai, died. \nOdom has played for a number of teams over his 15-year NBA career, most notably the Los Angeles Clippers and the Los Angeles Lakers. He also spent time on the rosters of the Miami Heat, Dallas Mavericks and New York Knicks. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio. All rights reserved.
