In the fifth inning, the Atlanta softball team blinked. Canton used back-to-back doubles and some opportunistic base running to plate three runs and that was all Olivia Jarvis needed as the Lady Tigers eliminated Atlanta in the Class 1 sectional round, 3-0. “It was a good game going into the fifth inning where they connected on a couple of base hits and it kind of went their way that time,” Atlanta coach Courtney Garnett said. “They’re a good team and I thought we played the best we could, so tip the hat to them and we wish them good luck.” Atlanta’s Haylee Petre, the Tri-County Conference MVP, stormed through the Canton batters for the first three innings. But in the fourth inning, Canton’s batters started to get their timing down and stopped swinging for the fences. “A lot of them were getting over excited and wanting to cream the ball out of the infield, so I told them to just be patient. I’ll take base hits over home runs any day and they did it, it just took a little bit of time,” Canton coach Kirsten Johnston said. In the fifth inning, Canton strung together three consecutive hits to plate the first two runs before an RBI ground out tallied the third and final run of the inning. After playing solid defense for the first four innings behind Petre, Canton just found the holes where there wasn’t an Atlanta defender. “I thought we played hard. It was a good, hard game but they got a few hits that inning that scored a few runs,” Garnett said. While Petre and the defense shut down Canton for six of the seven innings, Canton’s Jarvis one-upped Petre and pitched a one-hit, complete-game shutout. Atlanta’s Aleassa Hruska was the only Atlanta batter to get a hit against Jarvis, while the rest of the Atlanta lineup went 0-for-22. Garnett admits that a lot of thoughts crossed her mind to try and get her offense started but Canton’s defense took away a lot of would-be hits. “A lot of things cross your mind. They played really good defense and we tried to bunt a couple of times. Defensively, they played them really well and we just needed to have faith that we could connect and hit it hard,” Garnett said. “They hit it hard a few times, Canton just made the plays that they needed to.” While the season comes to a close for Atlanta a little earlier than it had wanted, Garnett pointed out that the Hornets have nothing to be ashamed after this season. Page 2 of 2 - “We won over 20 games, won a district championship, which hasn’t happened in over 20 years, so those girls have nothing to be ashamed of,” Garnett said. “We’re extremely proud of the girls, the community is proud of them and I think there will be good things to come from Atlanta softball.” Garnett did point out that the team will miss its three seniors (Sheyenne Klamert, Ashlea Pennington, Kirsten Gilliland), who had a big hand in the success this season. “Sheyenne at shortstop, Kristen at third and Ashlea in left, they all worked hard this season and we’re going to miss them,” Garnett said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:57:47.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
