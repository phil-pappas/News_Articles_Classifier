I’d hate to think athletic director Gene Smith wasted an entire press conference talking about uniforms for nothing. \n“Anything we can do to create a different environment, something that’s going to be more electric and exciting, is awesome for us,” linebacker Joshua Perry said. “One thing we expect going out there in every night game in the Shoe ... and that’s people going nuts. \n“Take the ‘black-out’ away and the uniforms away and the big thing you have to do is play ball and perform. But it should be an exciting night for us, definitely.” \nI may be wrong, but I seem to remember former coach John Cooper catching heck in some corners for wearing black and a different shade of red other than Scarlet on the sidelines. \nUrban Meyer, sensitive to disrupting tradition, had his own reservations. \n“My first reaction was no way, no chance,” Meyer said. “And then I looked and said, whoa, and it looked pretty sharp. Then Gene (Smith) looked at it, and granted I think there are some channels that everybody has to run them through to make sure they’re on par with what’s expected at Ohio State. Then you start thinking about the student body, the fans and the unique experience of recruiting players, and it’s kind of a unique experience.” \nRemember the photo that went viral last year of a black uniform prototype sitting on Meyer’s coffee table in his office? That was no accident. It was a calculated move. \n“It was sitting out for a reason,” Smith said. “That wasn’t for you (reporters) to come and look at so he could impress you. It’s sitting on the table because recruits saw it. \n“Recruits are impressionable today and have a great deal of materialistic interest. So reality is we’re going to respond to that. Our job, our core mission, is our student-athletes that we serve, first and foremost. And that includes the recruits we’re trying to attract. \n“So, yes, we talk about recruiting all the time, which is why we have a waterfall in the locker room that you can’t walk through. I’m old school. When you say waterfall, I figure I can go underneath it, get my hair wet. (It’s) killing me.” \nOSU’s marketing arm has dubbed this “Dark Night at the Shoe.” Given the spotty defensive play of late I would have preferred “Dark Knights at the Shoe” in hopes the Buckeyes would start playing like superheroes. \nTo me “Dark Night” conjures up negative vibes from “Dark Day” and “Dark Day II,” two regrettable moments in OSU lore when the Buckeyes lost back-to-back games in the late ‘80s to Indiana, ending a winless drought in the series for the Hoosiers that dated back to 1951. \nOhio State’s winning streak over Penn State is a more modest three games, but a loss Saturday would be even more seismic in nature, given the Buckeyes’ 26-game winning streak in Big Ten regular season games and how crippling any setback might be at this point in their bid to repeat as national champions. \nDistancing themselves from any label with “dark” in it might be better. As for Nike’s alternate uniform, black is one of my favorite colors, so have at it, guys, as long as you don’t play like you’re in the dark. \n“We heard rumblings, and weren’t sure it was going to happen, but to see the uniform is pretty awesome,” Perry said. “It’s going to do a lot for us in terms of just putting something different out there in prime time and I know recruits get excited about that stuff.” \nSo why stop there? Instead of Buckeye leaves, why not helmet tattoos?
