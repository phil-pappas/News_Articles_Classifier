Comment By Kevin J. Stone/Daily News Correspondent Milford Daily News By Kevin J. Stone/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 17, 2015 at 8:15 PM Updated at 8:16 PM By Kevin J. Stone/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 17, 2015 at 8:15 PM Updated at 8:16 PM SHARON — Saturday afternoon was an important day for the Milford football team. After giving up 82 points combined the past two weeks, head coach Joe Todd and the rest of his staff made defense a point of emphasis heading into the team’s matchup with Sharon this weekend and the Scarlet Hawks got the message. Thanks to three turnovers and just enough offense, Milford came away with a 17-7 win over the Eagles. The win keeps the Scarlet Hawks in the thick of the playoff race at 3-3 overall and 2-2 in league play heading into homecoming weekend next week against Stoughton. Sharon fell to 2-4 overall and 1-3 in the Hockomock. “This was a great response by our team today,” Todd said. “The kids knew we needed this game if wanted to play meaningful football in November and they played good defense all the way through today.” The first half was all about the Milford defense creating opportunities for the offense as the Scarlet Hawks played some very nice complimentary football and led by 14 at the break because of it. Sharon received the opening kickoff and proceeded to drive from its own 36 down to the Milford 15-yard line in 12 plays, chewing up a ton of clock, but the Scarlet Hawk defense stopped the Eagles on a fourth-and-7 with 5:11 left in the quarter. Milford took over and extended a 12-play drive of its own into the second quarter with Blake Hill capping the 78-yard march with a 5-yard touchdown run. Sean Lehane’s extra point put the Scarlet Hawks up 7-0 with 10:43 to play in the half. Sharon fumbled three plays into its next drive at the Eagle 24-yard line, but Milford was forced to punt. It was the only opportunity Milford couldn’t cash in on during the first 22 minutes. Sharon took over on its own 11 and drove down into Scarlet Hawk territory, but a Ryan Nesta interception at the Milford 30 halted the nine-play drive. Nesta returned the pick to the Sharon 33, setting up Milford’s offense for another golden opportunity with 3:37 to play in the half. Milford took advantage of it, this time running nine plays and capping things off with a 3-yard quarterback keep from Zach Lanzetta on a fourth-and-1. Another Lehane extra point made it 14-0 as the teams headed to the locker rooms. “Turning those turnovers into points is huge,” Lanzetta said. “It turns the game around and kind of stuns them a bit. It definitely helped us a lot.” After a scoreless third quarter in which the only big play came in the form of a Hill interception with 8:49 to play in the third, the Scarlet Hawk offense went up 17-0 on a Lehane 33-yard field goal with 4:53 remaining in the game. The kick capped off a four-play drive that began at Sharon’s 34-yard line following a turnover on downs for the Milford defense. Page 2 of 2 - The Eagles did get on the board with 3:01 left on a 64-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Rob Bayha to Craig Titus, but Hill, Shapel Feaster and Jack DeSantis all took their turns helping the Milford offense run out the rest of the clock. “We were just flying around today, we knew we needed to have this game,” Hill said. “We got embarrassed the last two weeks and just recommitted ourselves to defense this week. Offensively we just did enough to win the game, but we can clean some of that up too.” Now, the Scarlet Hawks will play the final regular-season game of the season next weekend against a Stoughton team that knocked off previously unbeaten Foxboro on Friday night. “It’s a must-win game for us, no question about it,” Lanzetta said. “We’ll be flying around again, the team wants it, I want it, and we’ve just got to have it.” By Kevin J.
