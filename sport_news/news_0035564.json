They need over 100 seats. Only the NDP can defeat the Conservatives and only the NDP can deliver the change we’ve been waiting for.”\nMulcair reiterated promises that an NDP government would hire new doctors and healthcare professionals in the Lower Mainland, work with the province to create more than 50,000 “15-dollar-a-day” childcare spaces, and deliver $5.2 billion in new infrastructure investment for projects like Surrey light-rail transit and the Broadway SkyTrain extension in Vancouver.\nRelated Stories Mulcair says only he can stop TPP deal, accuses Trudeau of siding with Harper NDP promises to make international trade negotiations more open to public scrutiny Political scientists weigh-in on NDP sliding in polls Maple Ridge | NDP Leader Tom Mulcair", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:01:14.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
