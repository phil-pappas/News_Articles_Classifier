Missouri hasn’t gone three straight games without a touchdown since 1937!\nAfter a controversial no-call fumble for Mizzou on the opening kickoff, the Tigers converted what would be their only first down play of the half. They only produced 51 yards through the first 39 minutes, and went a staggering 0-14 on third down.\nThe running game was non-existent, as up until the 2:00 minute mark punter Corey Fatony was the Tigers leading rusher. Fatony was the star of the game offensively, as the freshman booted nine punts averaging 48-yards, and running a fake punt 26 yards for a first down.\nThe Commodores also struggled to move the ball in the first half, as both teams punted the ball on six consecutive drives. It would take until the final minutes of the second quarter for Mizzou to score, as Charles Harris strip-sacked freshman Kyle Shurmur resulting in an Andrew Baggett field goal.\nEven with Fatony playing such a big role, his special team teammates did not hold up on their end as Baggett missed another field goal for the third straight week, and punt returner Cam Hilton had a costly fumble late in the 4th quarter.\nDown 10-3 with just over two minutes remaining, Vanderbilt kicker Tommy Openshaw missed a field goal giving final hope to Mizzou.\nQuarterback Drew Lock ran for 33 yards and suddenly the offense seemed to come alive, but even after a 4th down defensive pass interference the Tigers still couldn’t score.\nOn that final drive, Lock showed why he’s been good and bad this year, as his 33-yard run and a pair of 16 and 17-yard completions brought the Tigers within striking distance. However, he followed that up with four straight incompletions, two of which were way off the mark.\nThe true freshman would finish the day 14 of 34 passing for just 108 yards. The run game could not pick up the slack either, as Hansbrough continues to disappoint taking eight carries for 12 yards, and Witter added two carries for a mere three yards.\nThe offensive line was not without fault on Saturday, but the blame can really be split between the receivers as they feed off each other. There were multiple occasions when Lock was sacked not because of the line’s poor play, but the receivers' inability to get open. Wesley Leftwich had a tough day at the office as he sprung open deep three times, but couldn’t once connect with Lock who was consistently sailing the deep ball.\nThe defense is more of an after thought when the offense plays this poorly, but again, the Tiger defense impressed. Terry Beckner Jr. stepped up his play in the pass and run game with a sack and two tackles for a loss, Harris continues to be a force behind the line increasing his total to 15.5 tackles for a loss on the season, and Kentrell Brothers extends his NCAA tackle lead with another 12 tackle game.\nThis was a game that Mizzou simply needed to win to get the season back on the right track, and the offense just could not produce in the end. The upset victory gives Vanderbilt its first SEC win in 12 games, and drops Mizzou to 4-4 overall with bowl eligibility now in serious peril.\nThe Tigers have a bye next weekend to figure out some kind of offensive game plan, before they take on Mississippi State at home on Thursday, November 5th.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
