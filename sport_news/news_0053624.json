A game that featured a combined 192 plays from scrimmage and nearly 1,200 yards of total offense also saw the two teams exchange leads on nine occasions, including twice in the final 62 seconds of play. The dramatic finish came shortly after the visiting Buccaneers (2-3, 1-2 MASCAC) had rallied from a seven-point deficit (38-31) with just 1:44 remaining. After stopping the hosts on their own 28-yard line, MMA drove 72 yards in just four plays to take the lead on sophomore Kenny Pierce’s 14-yard touchdown run and a two-point conversion pass from senior quarterback Brad Skeffington to junior Jonathan Furtado. Skeffington amassed 374 yards of total offense in the setback for the Bucs, as he completed 18-of-47 passing attempts for 279 yards and four touchdowns while rushing for a team-best 95 yards on 24 carries. Furtado hauled in eight catches for 95 yards to go with his two scores and two-point conversion for the Buccaneers, who also received a 100-yard receiving day from Shane Haggerty. Pierce was a yard shy of reaching the 100-yard mark in all-purpose yards for the visitors, who also received 67 rushing yards from sophomore Richie Phillips (Onset). Bowling Green 62, UMass 38: Matt Johnson completed 33 of 39 passes for 450 yards and five touchdowns to lead host Bowling Green to a win over UMass.

UConn 40, Central Florida 13: Bryan Shirreffs threw for 256 yards and a touchdown and ran for another score and UConn snapped a three-game losing streak with a victory over winless Central Florida in an American Athletic Conference game in Orlando. Shirreffs generated two scores in the final 57 seconds of the first half that helped the Huskies (3-3, 1-1) take a 23-3 halftime lead. Maine 39, Albany 7: Dan Collins and Drew Belcher combined for four touchdowns, leading the visiting Black Bears. Collins led Maine (2-3, 2-1 Colonial) on three first-quarter touchdown drives, building a 20-0 lead. D.J.
