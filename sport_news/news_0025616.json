He acknowledged his lack of experience at international level, but expressed confidence in his ability to get good results.\n  \"Opportunities come along and I know people will question me, more as a selector than as a coach. But I hope to get it right because this is a great opportunity and I hope to give everything to meet expectations,\" the 53-year-old told a news conference in the Mexican capital.\nOsorio will make his debut next month when Mexico hosts El Salvador and travels to Honduras in qualifiers for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.\nHe is the first Colombian to lead the Mexican national squad.\nFerretti was in charge for four matches including last Saturday's dramatic extra-time victory over archrival the United States, which secured Mexico's place at the 2017 Confederations Cup.\nArgentine Ricardo La Volpe was the last to complete a four-year cycle with Mexico, leading the team to the knockout stage at the 2006 World Cup in Germany.\nSince then, Mexico has had a revolving door of coaches who were often criticized for underwhelming results: Hugo Sanchez, Jesus Ramirez, Sven-Goran Eriksson, Javier Aguirre, Enrique Meza, Efrain Flores, Jose Manuel De la Torre, Luis Fernando Tena, Victor Manuel Vucetich, Herrera and Ferretti.\n\"We understand the great responsibility to the Mexican people, which is a football nation par excellence that historically has produced great football stars,\" Osorio said.\nOsorio coached Mexican club Puebla for 11 matches in the 2012 season, losing seven of those before being dismissed. That record has led to criticism of Mexico's latest hire by some who came before him.\n\"It's nothing personal. It's football, and in a democracy everyone has a right to give their opinion,\" Osorio said. \"I think my stint in Puebla was productive. We learned about Mexican football and it brought us together to make this decision today and to fully identify with Mexican football.\"\nAfter leaving Mexico, Osorio led Colombian club Atletico Nacion to three league and two cup titles before moving to Sao Paulo in May.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:16:03.765+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
