But the challenge is one coach Mike Krzyzewski embraces. “I like it. It’s putting together a new team,” he said. “All the time I’ve been here, unless the ’91 team returned, we‘ve run a little bit different offensive system every year. This year it’ll be a lot different because we don’t have (Jahlil) Okafor. Defensively, we’ll also be different. We’re actually a little bit athletic and we’re longer. We have good width and that has to be translated into how it’ll be effective defensively.” Krzyzewski compared the restructure around personnel to the work he does with the U.S. National Team and also believes it will ultimately help in his team’s success. “It keeps them fresh, you’re not running the same stuff over and over and we stay fresh during the year,” he said. “I think some teams can become stale when you run the same thing over and over. The interesting thing about it is making those adjustments during the year.” This year’s Duke team is a squad of sharp shooters. The perimeter game will be the scoring force for the Blue Devils without question. “This year we have a lot of good shooters, our whole perimeter can shoot the ball really well,” sophomore Grayson Allen said. “When the floor’s spaced like that, there’s more lanes to drive. When you have guys around the perimeter like Brandon (Ingram), Luke (Kennard), Matt (Jones), Derryck (Thornton), they all have three-point shots that you have to respect on defense so you can’t help off of them as much. If you do help off, then it’s an easy drive and kick for a three.” The option to play in space is the main way Krzyzewski sees his team scoring inside, to the point that he isn’t even sure his team needs many by-design, work-inside plays. “Do we need (low-post play) that much? I don’t know,” Krzyzewski said. “When you have Okafor, you’re always going to go there. I think for a number of different reasons, not just one person. The one thing about (this year is) when you do get someone in the low post, he probably won’t be double- or triple-teamed.” Opportunistic low-post play is the expectation, and with a roster of versatile players, Coach K expects to also see as many as nine strong players in a starting rotation and contributing significant minutes. By position, Krzyzewski believes both Jones and Thornton will run the point, although for the latter, there needs to be an accelerated learning curve. “(Thornton has)to catch up for the fact that he wasn’t here this summer,” Krzyzewski said of the freshman. “But he is a point guard and a very good one.” Ingram, another one of the Blue Devils’ seven freshman, is a player the coach sees in multiple roles because of his versatility and his 6-foot-9 size with a 7-foot-3 wingspan and shooting ability. “Ingram will be all over – he’s that good of a player,” Coach K said. “He’s worked very, very hard and when he is at the four or the second big, so to speak, for perimeter guys posted, to be able to do stuff like that.” Fellow freshman Justin Robinson is being used similarly in practice too, and may also be in the mix with veterans Amile Jefferson and Marshall Plumlee to contend for time at different big man spots. “I’m enjoying being able to play 4 or 3,” Robinson said. “Sometimes even getting thrown into a run at 5, but that’s very rare. I do like the versatility there and my reach does help a lot. I love being able to guard guys like Amile and learning to guard them, and then have to guard Grayson for example. That switch changes a lot for me.” In light of having seven freshman, plus transfer Sean Obi who Coach K hopes to see work up to a contributing role, the NCAA’s winningest coach’s strategy in how his team will play and how the new pieces will fit together this season is very simple – use the strengths on the team. “Don’t let what you don’t do well get in the way of what you do well,” he said.
