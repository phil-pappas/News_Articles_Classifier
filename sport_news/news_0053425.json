In Philadelphia, this is a situation that happens about as frequently as a papal visit.\nIn other words, once every three or four decades.\nMichal Neuvirth is the unflappable backup who is impersonating Bernard Marcel Parent.\nSteve Mason is the high-quality starter who has missed the last two games because of a medical issue involving his family.\nMore coverage VOTE: Will the Flyers make the playoffs?

Latest hockey odds Assuming Mason is able to return this week - and he looked sharp Friday in his first full practice in five days - Hakstol figures to split the next two starts because the Flyers have back-to-back games: Tuesday against visiting Dallas and Wednesday in Boston.\nBeyond that, look for Mason to carry the load. On merit. He is coming off a career season and shouldn't be benched because he had to deal with a family crisis that has his teammates rallying around him.\nOn the other hand . . .\nNeuvirth, 27, who was signed as a free agent in the summer, has turned heads and made some history while doing it, causing some to turn to baseball history and suggest Mason is a modern-day Wally Pipp. So, it is also understandable if Hakstol is tempted to keep Neuvirth in the lineup until he starts to cool off.\nNeuvirth \"looked confident out there,\" Mason said. \"At the end of the day, he did his job. That's all you can ask of him.\"\n\"He's been great,\" center Sean Couturier said. \"I mean, we kind of expected that from him. He's a good goalie, and he's played a lot of games in the league.\"\nBut in his seven-plus NHL seasons, Neuvirth had never recorded back-to-back shutouts - until his first two starts with the Flyers. The Czech Republic native joined Jeff Hackett (in the 2003-04 season) as the only goalies in franchise history to accomplish the feat, and he also became the fifth goalie in NHL history who can make that claim with a new team.\n\"Two great team efforts,\" said Neuvirth, who made 31 saves in a 1-0 win over Florida and 30 stops in a 3-0 blanking of the defending Stanley Cup champion Blackhawks, both at the Wells Fargo Center. \"I'm seeing the puck well . . . and all five guys are playing as one unit. They've been there for me, and a lot of the shots have been from the outside.\"\nIn Flyers history, the only goalie to register three straight home shutouts was Parent, the Hall of Famer who did it in 1975. But Hakstol on Friday dropped hints that Mason will get the home start Tuesday against Dallas.\nNeuvirth was asked whether he is hoping to prove he deserves more than just an occasional start as Mason's understudy. He took the high road.\n\"I'm just going day by day and working hard - and every opportunity I get, I want to do my best, and if I do well, I will get more ice time,\" Neuvirth said. \"It's up to me and how well I do.\"\nSo far, he has been nearly impeccable, giving Hakstol and the Flyers confidence if Mason needs a rest or is unable to play.\nYou get the feeling Hakstol wants to get Mason back into the lineup as quickly as possible, wants him to get his mind back on hockey after a heartbreaking week off the ice.\nMason, 27, is eager to return, too. His teammates are protective of him.\n\"He's our backbone, and he's going through a lot right now,\" right winger Wayne Simmonds said after practice Friday . \"This is a family in here. All the guys know if you have a problem, you can come to any one of us. You're going to get that support, and we've got his back 100 percent.\"\nscarchidi@phillynews.com\n@BroadStBull\nphilly.com/broadstreetbull", "external_links": ["http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=article&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2FNHL_Philadelphia_Flyers"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:45:52.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
