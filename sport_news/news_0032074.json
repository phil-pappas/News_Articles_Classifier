And coach Jay Gruden’s only options behind him are backup Colt McCoy and Robert Griffin III, who he apparently has zero faith in. \nThat makes the Giants’ path to their first NFC East title since 2011 pretty straightforward. \nNot only do they have the best quarterback in the division, the lack of any big-time gunslingers for their defense to deal with is huge for a unit that’s already getting thin in the secondary. \nAnd the Giants should have a better chance against non-divisional foes as well. \nIn primetime last Sunday against the 49ers’ Colin Kaepernick, who came within a play of winning the Super Bowl, Manning’s fourth-quarter heroics included a perfectly thrown 12-yard touchdown pass to tight end Larry Donnell, with linebacker NoVorro Bowman draped all over him in the back of the end zone, with 21 seconds to play. \nIf Manning can get the Giants out of South Philly with a win — he has a 6-4 record at the Linc over his career — they’ll have a 1 1/2-game lead in the division, with the second-place Cowboys up next. That means by next Sunday the Giants could have the NFC East in a stranglehold. \nAll of this is why the Giants shelled out $84-million on a deal for Manning. There’s an opportunity for an immediate return on that investment. \nThe clock management woes of the first two weekends are long-forgotten, and he seems so much more comfortable with offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo than he was last season. \nAnd in his 12th season, Manning has never missed a game due to injury. \n\"It’s helped us immensely to be able to have that position solidified.’’ Giants coach Tom Coughlin said, \"and have an outstanding player, great leader at that spot over the years to be able to count on that knowing full well that that was going to be done as well as we could do it. Then we would have to deal with all the changes that have happened over the course of time around that position, but because Eli has been there as an anchor and a guy who we can always turn to, it’s been a spot that many times we’ve had to build a football team around. So thank goodness for that.’’ \nSo while it’s difficult to quantify exactly what Manning means to the Giants right now, his experience, ability and durability in a weak division could translate into a lot of wins in 2015. \nStaff writer Stephen Edelson is an Asbury Park Press columnist: sedelson@gannettnj.com 3 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1LHbT6G TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:58:08.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
