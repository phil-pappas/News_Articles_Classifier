The division cited two separate encounters over the weekend\nOn Saturday, conservation officers and the state park service were notified of two different bear-human encounters at Ramapo. Three female hikers and a male hiker along with his dog reported being pursued by a bear but escaped unharmed.\nThe second encounter, which occurred later the same day, involved a bear following another male hiker on the parkâ€™s Yellow Trail. According to the hiker, the bear repeatedly approached and swatted at him. The hiker fought back with pepper spray but the bear continued its pursuit, before relenting near a pedestrian bridge.\nTwo weeks earlier a pair of hikers was closely followed by a potentially aggressive black bear at the forest, a 21-year-old woman and a 7-year-old boy. A third park visitor also came within close proximity of the same bear\nThe park was closed on Sunday and traps were set at that time and a portion of the forest was closed to hiking. Division personnel have also been keeping area police apprised of developments.\nOn Monday, captured and euthanized a bear that biologists believe was the bear involved in the encounters but,traps will remain in place and will be monitored by the division personnel.\nFor information on dealing with black bears visit: www.state.nj.us/dep/fgw/bearfacts.htm\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1RxyovE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:26:08.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
