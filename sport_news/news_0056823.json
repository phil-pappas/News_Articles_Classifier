I'm going to try to play as hard as possible. It's been a great three days thus far.\"\nBulls coach Fred Hoiberg has complimented Portis for working hard in practice. So the 6-foot-11 forward was responding to a question about whether anyone has suggested he tone it down. Obviously, someone nicknamed \"Crazy Eyes\" isn't planning to relax.\n\"I'm just taking that nickname from what everybody else is calling me,\" Portis said with a smile. \"Everyone always talks about my eyes being bugged and everything. That's something I'm going to take and run with. I like that name.\"\nThe Bulls are excited about adding Portis this season. He was projected to go much higher than the No. 22 pick in June's NBA Draft and he played very well at times at the Las Vegas Summer League.\nPortis said he's trying to keep the chip on his shoulder every day and he has enjoyed the help he has received from older teammates, particularly Joakim Noah.\n\"He's like the big brother I never had,\" Portis said. \"Growing up, I was always the oldest. I never had a big brother. He's been there pushing me so far, reminding me everything I do should be hard and tenacious. I kind of feed off his energy, and both of us try and bring the team up a little bit.\n\"My favorite part (of playing in the NBA) is just being around these guys, having a band of brothers. That's something different for me, just having guys I can look up to. In my previous years, I was always the guy that was The Guy and everybody looked up to me. Now I'm looking up to other people.\"\nMcDermott stepped up next and talked about the two weeks he spent following Jimmy Butler's summer training routine in San Diego.\n\"He looked after me. I stayed at his mansion out there,\" McDermott said. \"It was awesome. It helped my confidence, just being around a guy like Jimmy.\n\"He would come in my room at 5 a.m. My alarm was set for 5:15, and we'd get up and go. It was tough but we accomplished a lot.\"\nButler's hard work carried him from the No. 30 pick to NBA all-star in four years. According to anyone who has witnessed Bulls practice this week, Butler appears ready take another step forward.\n\"He's been really impressive; hands down the best player on the floor,\" McDermott said. \"Yesterday he was guarding me and that was frustrating because he was everywhere. He was talking. He's worth the money, that's for sure.\"\nButler re-signed with the Bulls this summer for an estimated $95 million over five years. McDermott made it sound as if Butler is taking a page from Michael Jordan's playbook, talking trash to teammates in practice.\n\"He was talking (stuff) to all of us,\" McDermott joked. \"It didn't feel like he was on our team for a second. That's just kind of the way he is. He has a completely different mindset. He really wants to win. It's been really obvious the first few days of practice.\"\nâ€¢ Get the latest Bulls news via Twitter by following @McGrawDHBulls.\nRelated Article\nRose stays home to heal as Bulls camp continues NBA Bulls Basketball Members Get More Pro Men Video", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-02T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:44:40.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
