Junior forward Dani Profita converted the stroke that clinched the victory. The euphoric win avenged a 2-1 overtime loss to the Vikings on Sept. 15. \n“These games mean the world to us when we play Voorhees,” an emotional Profita said with tears of happiness streaming down her face.” \nProfita indicated she unaware of the exact situation when it was her turn to shoot the stroke. \nRELATED : Warren Hills, Voorhees field hockey teams should have played in H/W/S final \n“To be honest, during strokes I never count because I’m afraid I’ll get flustered and mess up,” Profita said. “At first I didn’t know it was over, but when I saw Rachel (Phillips) running toward me I figured we won.” \nRoncoroni scored the overtime goal to win the first meeting this season. And it looked like it might be a bad omen for Warren Hills when she gave the Vikings a quick lead on Saturday. \nFirst year Warren Hills coach Kate Rothman felt it was just a matter of time until her team got untracked. \n“We made some changes in the second half just moving some people around,” Rothman said. “I told them (before the penalty strokes) that no matter what happens, they played a great game. We played our hearts out. It’s going to be a happy bus ride back.” \nAlthough it’s easier said than done, Rothman placed special emphasis on stopping the talented Roncoroni. \n“Roncoroni is a fantastic player,” Rothman said. “We didn’t want her to beat us. We wanted the rest of the team to beat us. At times it was a bit scary, but I think we did a pretty good job on her.” \n“We were super pumped on the bus,” Profita said. “We knew (Voorhees) would come out hard. We just had to stay confident.” \nWarren Hills will play Hunterdon Central, a 2-1 winner over Hackettstown, for the H/W/S title next Saturday at Hackettstown. No matter what the situation, Rothman maintains faith in her team. \n“When these kids get down they don’t get upset,” Rothman said. “These girls are able to stay focused and in control. We have a bunch of mentally smart players.” \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com . Follow him on Twitter @TomHinkelLV .
