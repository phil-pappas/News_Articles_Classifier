(Marla Brose/Albuquerque Journal)\nCopyright © 2015 Albuquerque Journal\nTom Christopher and his volunteer crew at Balloon Fiesta Park were busy Thursday nailing to a tall wooden post signs with the names of foreign and U.S. cities, each sign pointing in a slightly different direction:\nMondovi, Italy, 8,989 km; Lorraine, France, 8,637 km; Indianola, Ind., 823 mi; Battle Creek, Mich., 1,256 mi.\nAcknowledging that no one was working with the benefit of a compass or a map, Christopher smiled widely: “The Sandia Mountains are east, Santa Fe is north. We’re getting them in the right general direction, I think. Brazil – that one’s going to be tough. Maybe we’ll just point it toward the ground,” he said.\nAll across the expansive park people were making final preparations in anticipation of Saturday’s opening of the 44th annual Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, which will feature 550 balloons, 16 of them from foreign countries, and 105 special shapes balloons. Visitors will find a full spectrum of fine art, folk art and balloon-related art and jewelry; as wide an assortment of food as is available at the State Fair, including funnel cakes, corn dogs, burgers, burritos and behemoth turkey legs; and two separate kid zones with rides and games.\nA harried vendor still putting the finishing touches on his food booth called out to a couple of guys milling about at the rear of a semitrailer truck loaded with food and soft drinks, “Hey, you gonna look at that stuff or you gonna unload it? Let’s get moving; we’re running out of time.”\nMany of the 43 food vendors and 45 merchandise vendors were trying to get their booths up and running with less than 48 hours left before tens of thousands of people would crowd the field during the opening day mass ascension. The entire length of Main Street at Balloon Fiesta Park was lined with parked semitrailer trucks, box trucks and pickups, all unloading building materials, merchandise, equipment and supplies.\n“I think it will be a good year,” said Marcus Cassimus, owner of Hello Deli, who was still organizing his booth. “Last year was a decent year, but not great. A lot of my regulars didn’t make it to the fiesta because of the heavy traffic and construction from the I-25 and Jefferson road projects. That’s done, so I’m expecting a larger turnout. Of course, everything depends on the weather.”\nWalgreens will have a retail outlet once again, selling candy, drinks, disposable cameras, hats, blankets and more.\n“We’ll also be offering flu shots,” said manager Robert Torres. “Last year, about 500 people took advantage of flu shots. They’re $10 and most insurance plans cover it, and when people see that they’re available they appreciate the convenience of it.”\nThe launch field at Balloon Fiesta Park will remain a large open expanse of grass, but the south end, where the corporate tents are located, was being spruced up Thursday with some 400 potted plants and shrubs. Crews from The Hilltop landscaping company were busy strategically placing rose bushes, desert willow, photinia, purple plum, caryopteris blue mist and others.\n“We should have most of them set by the end of the day and finish up Friday with some planters located on Main Street,” foreman Greg Domme said.\nTroy Bradley launches a Rainbow Ryders hot-air balloon Thursday as part of a ceremony to mark the 10th anniversary of the Anderson-Abruzzo Albuquerque International Balloon Museum. (Marla Brose/Albuquerque Journal)\nPilots and their crews were also busy Thursday with a mandatory viewing of a safety video and registration in the new Sid Cutter Pilots Pavilion, a large, modern building that replaces the enormous tent previously provided for the convenience of pilots.\n“We will probably have half to two-thirds of all the pilots registered by the end of the day,” said Paul Petrehn, the balloon fiesta’s event director. The pilots also get a “bag of goodies,” a rugged gym-type bag that includes a program, maps, event passes, a balloon fiesta jacket, miscellaneous coupons to local restaurants and retail outlets, and a special gift of a pair of pre-programmed two-way radios that allow pilots to have better continuous contact with their chase crews, Petrehn said.\nFor Austin pilot Bruce Lavorgna, fiesta preparation began weeks ago with the smoking, dehydrating and cooking of food for the crew of his balloon, “Aerodactyl.”\n“For our tailgate parties, I made 16 pounds of beef jerky, nine pounds of salmon jerky and a 30-pound platter of a five-layer lasagna with seven kinds of cheese and two kinds of meats,” he said.\nLavorgna, who operates an airplane upholstery business in Texas, said this will be his 29th year attending the Albuquerque balloon fiesta, and the 24th fiesta in which he has piloted a balloon.\nThree years ago, he and his crew were participating in the Albuquerque Aloft program in which pilots inflate and sometimes launch from elementary schools around the city to teach students, teachers and parents about how hot-air balloons fly.\n“We were at La Mesa Elementary School, which is in a poor neighborhood, and it was early in the morning and it was cold and we noticed that a lot of kids didn’t have jackets or coats,” Lavorgna said. “So we collected four dozen gently used coats, which we handed out last year.”\nThis year, he and his crew will donate between $500 and $800 for snacks for La Mesa’s after-school program, he said.\n“We’ve had so much fun coming to the balloon fiesta all these years, so this is our way of giving back.”", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/a01_jd_02oct_balloon3-640x427.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/a01_jd_02oct_balloon2-640x427.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:45:25.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
