MSU narrowly fell at Jacksonville 30-26 last week. The game can be heard live on the Eagle Sports Radio Network and Eagle Empire App and can be seen live on the OVC Digital Network. \n\"Homecoming is a special time,\" Head Coach Rob Tenyer said. \"I am looking forward to seeing some of our alumni back, and I want our current players to realize how special Homecoming is and to remember to take pride in their alma mater when they finish.\" \nBesides the festivities, Tenyer knows his team will have a tough task on the field, but he feels if they stick to their game plan, they can have success. \n\"We have to do what we do best, and we'll be ok if we do that,\" he said. \"Butler is a talented team, so we want to take away some of the things they do best. They have a talented quarterback who can run just as well as pass.\" \nButler signal-caller Matt Schiltz leads all PFL quarterbacks with 80 rushing yards per game and throws for more than 200 per outing. \nOffensively, Morehead State continues to be a pass-heavy scheme with junior quarterback Austin Gahafer leading the conference with 14 touchdowns. His top targets have been junior slot Jake Raymond and senior slot Justin Cornwall. Both average more than 70 yards per game, with Cornwall ranking second in the nation with eight touchdown catches. \nDefensively, the Eagles will be looking to reverse their recent fortunes against the Bulldogs, allowing 62 points last year in Indianapolis and 58 the year before at home. MSU's defense has been stout at home, not allowing an opponent point in the last 158 minutes dating back to the finale in 2014. \n\"Our defense continues to make plays and get better,\" Tenyer said. \"We have been very good at takeaways and being aggressive, and I'm not surprised. We have a lot of guys out there with a lot of experience now, and they have matured into a solid unit.\" \nMorehead State is idle next weekend before traveling to Campbell on Oct. 24.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:02:25.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
