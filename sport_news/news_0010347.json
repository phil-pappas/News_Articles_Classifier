TB12 offers health strategies developed by Brady and Guerrero. A profile in Boston Magazine labels Guerrero a \"glorified snake-oil salesman\" over claims that a supplement called Supreme Greens could cure cancer and a long list of other diseases before he was sued by the government.\nGlaceau Tom Brady was once a spokesman for Smartwater, a Coca-Cola product. In his chat Monday on t he \" Dennis & Callahan Morning Show,\" Brady threw out the Atlanta beverage company as an example of how images can be distorted:\n\" You probably go out and drink Coca-Cola and think, 'Oh yeah, that’s no problem.' Why, because they pay lots of money for advertisements that think that you should drink Coca-Cola for a living? No. I totally disagree with that. And when people do that, I think that’s quackery. And just the fact that they can sell that to kids? That’s poison for kids,” Brady said.\nIt should be noted that in 2007 Brady became a paid spokesman for Coca-Cola’s Glaceau Smartwater.\nFollowing his remarks, Coca-Cola issued a statement that in part stated, \"We offer more than 200 low‐ and no‐calorie beverages in the U.S. and Canada and a wide variety of smaller portion sizes of our regular drinks.\"\nThe spokesman also offered \"all of our beverages are safe and can be enjoyed as part of a balanced lifestyle.\"\nBrady's offseason was marred in controversy over accusations he had knowledge that the footballs used in games were underinflated. He went to court to challenge a four-game suspension issued by the NFL and won. With Brady under center, the Patriots are 4-0 and face the Indianapolis Colts Sunday night.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/14/75/c9/brady-water.jpg", "http://www.foxbusiness.com/industries/2015/10/13/tom-brady-calls-coca-cola-poison-takes-swipe-at-frosted-flakes/", "http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2015/10/09/tom-brady-alex-guerrero-neurosafe/"], "published": "2015-10-14T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:18:58.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
