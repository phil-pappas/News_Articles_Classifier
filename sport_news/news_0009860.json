He searches the shooting pocket and knows where his range is; always gets to his spot early so you have to recover to him quickly. Prefers to face up in the post and face the basket and has a shot fake he likes. He really likes the middle for that one-dribble pull-up shot. He is so long his shot is hard to defend. I scouted their (preseason) game against Miami and it’s amazing the effect their culture has on people. I’ve never seen Aldridge get rid of the ball so fast. That guy never passes and he made some great quick passes. Defensively, you want to put him in pick-and-roll and get him away from the basket as much as possible. Make him try to defend multiple actions and you can get an angle to attack him.”\nKYLE ANDERSON\n“A very offensive-minded player who thinks shoot every time he catches so you have to keep court awareness of him. He’s going to run to the 3-point line and he’s not afraid to shoot it. A very skilled player who knows how to get to his shot but doesn’t do anything quickly. Defensively he’s very slow of foot so you want to make him work on defense and don’t settle for a contested shot. Attack him and get downhill. Doesn’t play as hard as he should all the time, which is surprising for a Spurs first-rounder.”\nMATT BONNER\n“No secrets to his game: He’s a spacing four man and you have to find him at the 3 line, particularly in transition because he trails the break late and shoots threes with efficiency. You have to be aware of him on pick-and-roll and be ready to close on him. You want to make him put the ball on the floor and do anything but pick-and-pop and spot shot. Also a very good offensive rebounder, a hustle guy and second-effort guy, he gets a lot of loose balls because he’s always moving . Defensively you have to attack him, especially if you’re bigger.\nBORIS DIAW\n“Versatile offensive player who does a little of everything really well. Primary thing is passing and he’s excellent, either from the post or perimeter. Defending him you have to have active hands and you have to try to speed him up. If he gets to look over the defense you’re at a big disadvantage. Moves well within Spurs system because he’s a system guy. You have to know where he’s at and that when he has the ball he’s probably thinking pass first. Smart defensive player. Doesn’t try to do too much and will probably try to stay back and play in the paint. Has long arms and hands and gets a lot of deflections. Bigger than people think. You have to be careful around him and get to the paint and put pressure on him. If he can just read and react he’s really good. A terrific fit for the Spurs because of his skill level and being a good system player. Has been in better shape in San Antonio than any other time in his career. Very versatile but he’s a natural as a mobile four and sometimes a five.”\nTIM DUNCAN\n“Where do you start with this guy? Greatest power forward in the history of the game and one of the smartest players in the league. That should cover it. Seriously, he really knows the Spurs way and is always going to play within himself. On the post he’s going to face up, give a pump fake and shoot the bank shot. If not, he’ll get to the middle and get the jump fake and then hook shot. You want to contest without fouling in the post. No part of his game is off the floor. It’s all length but he’s really an angle scorer who tries to lift you a little and angle score around you. An excellent passer with great vision and has played with some of those guys so long he can read and get back doors. Defensively you want to make him run up and down and exert a lot of energy in transition. Quick pick-and-rolls against him are good, so sprint and then quick pick and roll him. At a point in career he doesn’t want to move much. Everyone who knows anything in this league loves the guy because he’s about all the right things.”\nMANU GINOBILI\n“After seeing him play in Miami I’d say he looks very very healthy at the start of the year; as spry as I’ve seen him in a couple of years. Of course, the way they play their guys he will still be able to give them important minutes and time when it’s needed. It’s important for Manu that they have the strong bench they have because they don’t depend on him as much as in the past. His skills are still tremendous and he still does some of the acrobatic things he’s been known for. Of course, he still gets left every time. How does he do that after all these years? He knows his teammates so well he finds them whenever they’re open. One of the many vets who understands what they want and how to get where they want to go. It’s all about how much he can do at his age and what he’ll be like after 82 games.”\nDANNY GREEN\n“At a good age and is just one of those guys who fits the Spurs so well. He made a good decision to come back to the best place for him. He helps them get to championship caliber because he’s unselfish and has learned to shoot the 3-ball at a high percentage. A very important part of what they do and he is in his athletic prime. He could have gotten more to play for someone else but he obviously understands he is better off with the Spurs. Defensively, he’s not quite as good as he once was but he’s smarter as a team defender and knows how to cut angles and be at a high level. And with Kawhi Leonard around he no longer has to take the hardest perimeter defender to guard. He’s still at a higher level than the No. 2 perimeter threat on the other team, so that works out perfectly for him and the Spurs.”\nKAWHI LEONARD\n“Another one of those guys who is a perfect fit and now he has gotten paid, but that won’t affect what he’s about and where he’s at there. He understands what is expected defensively: guard the opponent’s best player. But he can also take the other point guard and disrupt his game and, with it, the opponent’s attack. Seems to get better every year but this year his better offensive skills aren’t needed as much because of Aldridge. Won’t be a surprise if Kawhi’s scoring numbers go down but he probably doesn’t care. He can score and that’s all that matters. The nice part is it’s not always a necessity that he has to be the guy and it’s easier to play when the pressure isn’t there every possession.”\nBOBAN MARJANOVIC\n“Fantastic signing for the Spurs. I’d seen him a lot in Europe and he’s a terrific kid that everyone likes; a guy with a very infectious personality who is always positive. He’s limited as far as NBA skills because the game is a bit fast for him. He can protect the paint very well as a shot blocker if shooters come to him and he is in the lane but he’s not quick enough, spot to spot, to block from the weak side and his reaction time is a little slow. The good thing is that he knows what he is: a rebounder and shot blocker. Offensively he will be a screener and a catch-at-the-rim dunker and a guy who sometimes gets a put-back basket. On the Spurs he won’t have to do a lot offensively. They will teach him where to be and come under the basket on drives and be effective. The whole issue for him is the speed of the game but his size does make a difference.”\nRAY MCCALLUM\n“One of those guys who was always a scoring point guard and has always been trying to become a true point guard but hasn’t been able to consistently run a team and make plays and shoot at a high level consistently. That said, he’s very talented and good physically and the Spurs know how to get the most of his talent. Scouts seem to have mixed feelings about him: Some like him a lot; others not at all. He can be a player who can really help if Tony (Parker) needs to be rested or (Patty) Mills is injured. He’s a very good third point guard to have on their bench and once he gets experience with them he will be a contributor but just needs to be more consistent.”\nPATTY MILLS\n“If healthy he is terrific off the bench. Obviously, shooting is his best trait and he can give a big boost off the bench. His being healthy from the start helps him a lot. Missing him last season hurt them more than most people know. Defensively his best thing is pestering full court but physically he gives up buckets because he just can’t play against points with size. But he’s a typical San Antonio guy who now understands the team defense better and that helps his physical limitations.”\nTONY PARKER\n“Health is important to him more than ever before. When he’s right he can be close to the Tony Parker of old. He’s lost a little bit, and I think just a little bit. And when he’s that quick, aggressive guy he’s still a great leader for his team and his knowledge of the San Antonio system is amazing. He may know it better than Pop by now, and I’m being serious. It really makes a difference when he is in the game because he makes everyone on offense better. Only time will tell if he can physically make it through the season without one of those nagging injuries that now seems to linger longer. People made a big deal of how poorly he played in Eurobasket but pressure is different when you’re trying to carry a team rather than being on the Spurs. I think he will have a good year because of their firepower and the fact he won’t have to carry such a big load. He is still a huge part of game planning to stop the Spurs because he puts the pressure on the defense right from the start. I’d say that means he is still one of their most important guys.”\nJONATHON SIMMONS\n“A tough, hard-nosed, versatile defender and offensive player. I would describe him as a two-three-one, position-wise, because there were times in Austin when they had injuries or guys were signed to the NBA when he was forced to play point guard and did a solid, serviceable job. The more he played the point the better he got, so he can be an emergency point guard. Passing is his best attribute and he can really see the floor. Very unselfish and makes the extra pass. He’s pretty skilled. Can’t shoot at an NBA level but has improved the last couple of years, especially from three, but it is his Achilles heel and he will have to prove he can knock down mid-range and long-range jumpers. Really strong going to the basket and explosive. As they develop him he could be a guy they can use going forward.”\nDAVID WEST\n“The ultimate pro, on and off the court. He is a leader, as if they needed more leaders. He is a very, very high basketball IQ guy, as if they needed more of those. He’s really a great fit for them and takes up a little slack as far as taking some pressure off Tim because he’s more of a physical presence than Aldridge and can give them a little of what (Aron) Baynes brought the last couple seasons as far as being a guy you don’t want to tangle with in the post. He will take a charge and will be a great addition. Don’t forget: His mid-range game is almost as good as Aldridge’s. His post game is not as good (as Aldridge) but it’s not bad. Defensively he’s as good as it gets as far as pick-and-roll and knowing what other teams will be running because he is such a student of the game and of the league. Another terrific pickup for them.”", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/52/00/8298515/17/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/52/00/8298515/17/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843119/4/920x920.jpg", "https://myaccount.expressnews.com/dssSubscribe.aspx?pid=495&z=00000", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/52/8817291/8/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843120/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/36/12/51/7907907/24/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843120/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843123/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843119/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/50/52/8817291/8/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/35/62/45/7809375/32/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843122/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/36/02/66/7876011/20/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/36/02/66/7876011/20/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843121/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843122/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/35/62/45/7809375/32/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/16/8754097/10/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/16/8754097/10/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/36/12/51/7907907/24/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843123/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/56/75/8843121/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-25T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:04:05.751+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
