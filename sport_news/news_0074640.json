He struck out eight without a walk in the kind of clutch performance the Royals expected when they traded for him.\nThe Royals’ closer Wade Davis breezed through the ninth.\nThe defending AL champs will host the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 1 on Friday night. The teams have met once before in the ALCS with the Royals winning in seven games in 1985 — they would go on to beat the St. Louis Cardinals for their only World Series triumph.\nThe Royals trailed 2-1 in the fifth when Alex Rios led yet another comeback with a go-ahead, two-run double. Eric Hosmer and Ben Zobrist also drove in runs, while Kendrys Morales capped the festive night with a three-run homer off Dallas Keuchel in the eighth to put it away.\nCollin McHugh (1-1), who won the divisional series opener for Houston, allowed three runs in four-plus innings. His bullpen fared little better just two days after it blew a four-run, eighth-inning lead to send the series back to Kauffman Stadium for Game 5.\nKansas City has now won 10 of its last 13 playoff games at home.\nThat was plenty of support for Cueto, who was acquired from the Reds for a package of left-handed prospects just before the July 31 trade deadline precisely for moments like this.\nMixing quick-pitch fastballs with hesitation changeups, Cueto made the Astros look foolish most of the night. He jawed with Houston outfielder Carlos Gomez, strutted around like a Wild West gunfighter, and had the unmistakable swagger of an October ace. After all, Cueto was finally proving that he was one.\nHis star turn came after going 0-2 in his first four playoff starts, including a forgettable outing in Game 2 against Houston. He allowed four runs in six innings in that game, though Kansas City’s offense and its stingy bullpen ultimately bailed him out.\nThere was no need for any help this time. Cueto was good enough on his own.\nHouston ab r h bi K.C. ab r h bi\nAltuve 2b 4 0 0 0 AEscor ss 3 1 1 0\nSpringr rf 4 0 0 0 Zobrist 2b 2 0 0 1\nCorrea ss 3 0 0 0 L.Cain cf 3 2 1 0\nClRsms lf 3 0 0 0 Hosmer 1b 4 0 1 1\nCGomz cf 3 0 0 0 KMorls dh 4 1 1 3\nGattis dh 3 1 1 0 Mostks 3b 4 0 0 0\nValuen 3b 3 1 1 2 S.Perez c 2 1 1 0\nCarter 1b 3 0 0 0 AGordn lf 3 1 1 0\nJCastro c 2 0 0 0 Rios rf 3 1 2 2\nTucker ph 1 0 0 0 Orland rf 0 0 0 0\nTotals 29 2 2 2 Totals 28 7 8 7\nHouston 020 000 000 — 2\nKansas City 000 130 03x — 7\nDP—Houston 2.
