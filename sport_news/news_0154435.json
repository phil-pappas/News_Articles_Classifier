LA for the weather and I like playing at Staples. Chicago, because it's my home state and I have friends who now work there. And Indy, because that's more family, friends, hometown people.\"\nMe: It's close to your hometown?\nA: \"Yeah. Chicago's four hours away and Indy's only an an hour and fifty minutes.\"\nTubbs McGee\nQ: Have you taught your dog (Bella) any tricks?\nA: \"We actually got really lucky. Bella, honestly, she's super smart — almost too good for her own good, sometimes. But (Wesley Matthews) used a trainer for his dog and when I got Bella, I was asking him who he used. So I met her and we developed a really good relationship with this lady. She (worked with Bella) Monday through Friday and she taught her to sit, lay down, roll over, play dead, shake. Also, there's this thing we call climb; if we point to the couch or her soft dog bed, she has to stay there until we release her. So if the mailman or a friend comes to the door ... she's good. She's well trained.\"\nJT\nQ: What are your favorite go to places in PDX, food-wise or just for fun?\nA: \"Let's go with a top 3 for food: Ox, Sinju Sushi at Bridgeport and Por Que No. And places to visit; I think it's cool to go down to NW 23rd Ave. sometimes to get Salt & Straw (ice cream) for example. There's always a good vibe down there. (My wife) Elle and I have done a lot of hikes. We've done Eagle Creek, Multnomah Falls, Triple Falls, Horsetail Falls; we've done a whole bunch of different hikes. We think being outdoors is cool. And just stuff in the area, too. We've gone to the Tillamook Cheese factory. I know the Redwoods are way far away, but eventually we want to go there. We've been to the coast, we've been to the mountains, we've been to Sunriver Resort, been to Hood River, just did an apple orchard three weeks ago at Mt. View Orchard. I think it's cool to do stuff in the area. If you're here and have down time, why not see what's going on? Elle and I, we love traveling. So even if it's just within Oregon, we think it's awesome to see different things.\"\nMr.UncleWiffy\nQ: Does he still have the Barbie Princess backpack he was made to carry his rookie year? What happened to it?\nA: \"I do. And I don't plan on getting rid of it, because it's a symbol for my rookie year. I actually saw it the other day. It's in a box of random things that sits in storage at the house.\"\nJared Cowley\nQ: What is your all-time favorite film? TV show? Book?\nA: Film: \"The Dark Knight. TV show: Right now, it's Blacklist. Favorite book: Lone Survivor.\"\nGunjaDim\nQ: Who won the fights between you and your brother while growing up — he became a U.S. Marine but you became 7-foot-1?\n\"Bailey and I never fist fought or physically fought. We'd yell at each other and get mad. But we both had a certain amount of respect for each other, even at that age. But I will say this: When he came back from boot camp I was a senior in high school and I thought I was a big-timer and he was talking to me about discipline and all these different things he had done. And he said something like, 'I could put your on your back right now.' And of course I smarted off and said, 'Whatever.\" I was looking the other way and as I turned back, sure enough, he pinned my arms back and leg-sweeped me and I was on the ground in a second.\" (laughs)\njumpstotts\nQ: Why did your parents name you Meyers? That is a common last name, not a first.\nA: \"That would be my father's mother's maiden name. So that's where I go that. Let me ask you this: Has anyone every met another Meyers?\"\nMe: I haven't.\nLeonard: \"OK then. You ever met another Joe?\"\nMe: Yes.\nLeonard: \"There you go.\"\nel buffer\nQ: You described Chris Kaman as one of your best friends. I've seen his crazy reality show. What kind of jokes or tomfoolery do you guys get up to when you're off-court (the funniest thing or prank he's pulled)?\nA: \"Honestly, it's not a lot of joking with Kaman and I. It's really more that he wants to teach me about life. And he also talks to me about basketball. He tells me to continue to believe in myself, gives me little pointers on posting up and being ready to shoot the ball, sprinting back on defense, having a tough mentality. And off the court, he talks more to me about family, what it's like to have a kid. Our morals and our beliefs are very alike, we're very loyal to family and just little things like that. He cares about me as a person and as a basketball player, but he's honestly like a mentor. We joke around here and there, but I don't know of a prank he ever did, really.\"\nrastus5657\nQ: Meyers, you left school early. What are your plans relative to graduation and what is/was your major? And how would you like to use that in the future?\nA: \"I studied Sports Management at the University of Illinois. Luckily I was able to take what they call dual credit classes in high school, so I got some of my general education classes out of the way. I did summer school at Illinois to try to get some extra classes out of the way. So when I left as a sophomore, I was almost three years done. I do want to try to get my degree. There's a few things that I'll look at; where I'm at in life, what my summers look like and, the most important one, they don't offer my major online. So that's the hard part. It would have to be in person, where I'd rather be working out with the team and different things. It's kind of a balance.\"\nMe: How would you use the major in the future?\nA: \"I would think, to some capacity, I'm going to stay in the sports field. How or when or what, I don't know.\"\nAllan Brettman\nQ: Illinois 14, Nebraska 13. Anomaly or a sign of things to come?\nA: \"I think the program seems to be making a decent turn. In all sports, the Big 10 is always up there, especially in football. You talk about Ohio State, Michigan State, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Northwestern, Penn State. All the way down the line. Iowa's good. There's never an easy game.\"\nMe: So a sign of things to come?\nA: \"I think so.\"\nThanks to Meyers for taking the time to answer the questions.\nIf you missed past editions of \"Ask The Trail Blazers,\" here's a recap:\nCJ McCollum would interview Jesus and has an affinity for Allen Iverson.\nChris Kaman, avid hunter, would like to bag an Alaskan moose .\nDamian Lillard is into roller skating .\nFormer Blazers:\nWesley Matthews has \"Call of Duty\" skills .\nNicolas Batum dreams in English and French .\nRobin Lopez loves DeLoreans .\nArron Afflalo had a rap song produced about him, but can't rap himself .\nThomas Robinson likes fashion better than lifting weights .\nWill Barton is fond of crab cakes .\n— Joe Freeman | jfreeman@oregonian.com | 503-294-5183 | @BlazerFreeman", "external_links": ["http://connect.al.com/user/RandyPangolin/index.html", "https://twitter.com/BlazerFreeman"], "published": "2015-10-14T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:21:10.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
