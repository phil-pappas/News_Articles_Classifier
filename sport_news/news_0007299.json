The Chronicle will do a full review of the matchup in our Tuesday issue. Panthers head coach Mark Wattenbarger on the change: “I think it’s a good move for us with all the activities going on and all of the Homecoming activities possibly being underwater, we don’t want that going on,” Wattenbarger said. “Obviously it’s going to help the gate, the concessions and all of that. I appreciate the administration working out all of the details and getting that move for us.” Coach Wattenbarger on if field conditions played a factor in the schedule change: “I think a little bit. Again, you have girls that are going to be on the field for the Homecoming court and with the possibility of thunderstorms rolling in. The potential for the game being completely cancelled until the next day -- all of those factors played into the decision.” Coach Wattenbarger said. “The dry conditions will be nice.” Coach Wattenbarger on Homecoming 2015: “Obviously the kids like it. There are lots of activities during the week and the kids get fired up about it. You hope the distractions from all of the activities don’t take away from all of our kids in the game, but it is an exciting week the kids like it and get pretty pumped up for it.” Wattenbarger said. “Sequoyah is going to come in here and give us a challenge, so we’ve got to be ready to play. I’m hoping Homecoming didn’t cause a distraction for our players.” Quarterback Austin Helton on being 7-0: “The first couple of games we had to take one by one and the last few games we looked ahead. We can’t do that anymore,” Helton said. “We need to get back to taking games one at a time to reach the playoffs; that’s where we want to be.” Helton on who he relies on in the offense: “The main thing I do is to tell our offensive line to step it up,” Helton said. “Our success is from them. I tell them to get after it, and if they do that any of our backs can make a move for us, I trust all of those guys equally.” Helton on the Sequoyah Hurricanes: “They are pretty athletic and physical but if our defense plays well we should be fine in this one.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:24:41.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
