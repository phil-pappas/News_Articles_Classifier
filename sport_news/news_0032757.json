It lets me know I’m doing something the right way, trying to inspire these kids to be not only great athletes on the floor but great role models off the floor and represent their universities the right way. It’s very humbling, and I thank Ohio State for it.”\nJames is expected to play against the Grizzlies, who feature a prominent former Buckeye: guard Michael Conley, who led Ohio State to the 2006-07 national championship game in his lone season with the program. Mo Williams, James’ teammate, is out for the game, coach David Blatt said, while J.R. Smith is likely out.\nMatta has consistently referenced James and Conley throughout his coaching career, even when James angered Ohioans by leaving the Cavaliers to play for the Miami Heat following the 2010 season. James said he saw Matta this summer at his camp and that he’s impressed with the job he has done with the Buckeyes.\nAsked what it meant to have Matta stand by him even when he wasn’t the “most popular guy in the state,” James turned on the humor.\n“I’ve been very popular in this state for 30 years,” he deadpanned. “‘All press is good press – John Gotti.’”\nA self-professed Ohio State football fan, James was asked what he thought of Urban Meyer’s handling of the quarterback situation this season. The two speak regularly, James said.\n“I’m not here (to criticize) Coach,” James said. “He’s done great because he doesn’t listen to guys like me. He’s doing a great job. I think he’s a great leader. I think they’re going to have a great year. I think all Buckeye Nation knows that. It’s great to have support from a guy like that, and I try to give it back to him.”\najardy@dispatch.com \n@AdamJardy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T14:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:40:34.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
