Senior Erin Schulz was 2-3 with a double and freshman Jordan Wear went 2-2 with a double of her own. Freshman Zoe King, sophomore Hannah Warner, juniors Lauren Nelson and Tessa Dethlefs and freshman Julie Klemm all singled. \nSophomore Kloey Appel had a double and threw a two-hitter to earn the win. She struck out four batters, walked none, and allowed just a pair of hits. \nAgainst the Gators, the Pioneers jumped out to an early 4-0 lead before surrendering the next nine runs. They scored seven in the fifth and eight more in the seventh to cruise to the big victory. \nFort Calhoun outhit Wisner-Pilger 21-16 and were led by Nelson, who finished the game a perfect 5-5 with a double and a pair of RBIs. Baxter added three more hits (she's got nine in her last three games) and a trio of RBIs. \nSchulz was 2-5 with a double and senior Jordan Coulter went 2-4. Klemm had two triples and a team-high five RBIs, a breakout game for the freshman. Warner was 2-6 and scored three times. Wear chipped in two hits and King and senior Grace Herold each finished with one. \nFort Calhoun 12 West Point-Beemer 0 \nWP-B (12-12) 000 0 0 2 0 \nFort Calhoun (13-8) 330 6 12 11 0 \nWP_Appel 2B_Schulz, Appel, Wear \nFort Calhoun 19 Wisner-Pilger 10 \nFC (14-8) 400 070 8 19 21 5 \nWP (14-14) 500 401 0 10 16 3 \nWP_Klemm 2B_Baxter, Nelson 3B_Klemm (2) Ã—", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T04:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T05:09:09.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
