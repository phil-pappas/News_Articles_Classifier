Clayton is a singer who is most famous for doing the backup vocals to the Rolling Stones classic \"Gimme Shelter.\" Richards will perform the tribute with Waddy Wachtell, Ivan Neville, Willie Weeks, Steve Jordan, Sarah Dash, Lisa Fischer and Bernard Fowler. Wachtell, Neville and Steve Jordan are part of Richards' X-Pensive Winos band. Fischer and Fowler are backup singers for the Rolling Stones.\nIn addition, Richards is on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine's issue dated Oct. 22, 2015. According to Rolling Stone, \"Richards recently suffered a very painful injury, which he's been keeping secret.\" The injury happened on July 4, 2015, when the Rolling Stones were performing in Indianapolis, and he tripped on a hat that an audience member had thrown on stage. Richards told Rolling Stone: \"I might've cracked a rib. There's nothing doctors can do about it. I thought, 'Sh*t, if I let them know how much I'm hurting, the doctors and the insurance companies will be like, 'Cancel the next gigs.' F*ck it. I'll live with it. After 50 years on the stage, you're going to fall over occasionally and take a knock.\"\nRichards also revealed in the interview that when he goes to restaurants, he never eats any food. He also confirmed his earlier statements that the Rolling Stones will record an album of new songs, which will presumably be released in 2016 or 2017. Richards' third studio solo album, Crosseyed Heart , was released in September 2015, and was a Top 20 hit in several countries.", "external_links": ["http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/it-aint-easy-being-keith-richards-inside-the-new-issue-20151007"], "published": "2015-10-22T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:20:42.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
