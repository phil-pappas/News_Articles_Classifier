Dickey. \nThe Royals also had 15 hits in Game 3 on Monday, but their late rally fell short and they lost 11-8. \nThis time they scored five runs (four earned) on four hits and two walks in 1 2/3 innings to chase Dickey (0-1). \n\"In my first inning, I had trouble arresting the damage,\" Dickey said. \"Sometimes it's hard when you put your team in a hole, especially (against) a playoff-caliber team. They kept tacking on. They kept hitting, they kept hitting.\" \nKansas City put the game away with a four-run seventh and added three in the eighth and two in the ninth. \n\"There's no doubt it's a big challenge,\" Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. \"It's a do-or-die game (Wednesday). I think these guys will let this one go, and they'll show up to play tomorrow.\" \nGibbons brought in infielder Cliff Pennington to pitch with two outs in the ninth. Pennington allowed a single to right fielder Paulo Orlando and a two-run single by shortstop Alcides Escobar, who had four RBIs. \nThe ninth ended when Zobrist fouled out to the catcher. \n\"I was impressed, he has good stuff,\" Toronto catcher Russell Martin said. \nThe bullpen was short because left-hander Aaron Loup was called away for a personal family matter for the second time this postseason. \n\"He got a call and he had to head to the airport and head home,\" Gibbons said. \"We were in a bind.\" \nRoyals center fielder Lorenzo Cain went 2-for-3 with two walks and three RBIs to extend his team-record postseason hitting streak to 13 games. Rios finished with three hits. \nKansas City right-hander Chris Young did not stay around long enough to earn the win. \nHe was lifted for right-hander Luke Hochevar (1-0) with a 5-2 lead and two outs in the fifth after giving up a single to left fielder Ben Revere. \nHochevar ended the inning on a foulout to first by third baseman Josh Donaldson. \nYoung allowed two runs, three hits and two walks and struck out four. \n\"Chris Young threw the ball great,\" Yost said. \"We got to the fifth there and my mindset was with Donaldson, (right fielder Jose) Bautista, those guys, I really didn't want them seeing Chris for the third time.\" \nThe Royals pounced on Dickey for four first-inning runs, two on a home run by Zobrist after Escobar led off with a bunt single. \nThe knuckleballer walked Cain, who stole second, took third on a single by first baseman Eric Hosmer and scored on a passed ball. A groundout moved Hosmer to third, and he scored on a sacrifice fly by third baseman Mike Moustakas. \nRios' homer with one out in the second increased the lead to 5-0. \n\"We were really focused on being productive collectively,\" said Rios, a former Blue Jay. \"And I guess we're doing a pretty good job of doing it. Defensively, we've been good. Offensively, we've been even better, so that's what we've been focusing on.\" \nRoyals right-hander Liam Hendriks took over with two outs in the second after Dickey hit Escobar with a pitch and walked Cain. Escobar was picked off second to end the inning. \nThe Blue Jays scored twice in the third. Second baseman Ryan Goins singled, Revere walked and Donaldson hit an RBI ground-rule double. Bautista's groundout to second scored the other run. \nHendriks allowed one hit in 4 1/3 scoreless innings before right-hander LaTroy Hawkins took over in the seventh and could not retire a batter. \nA leadoff walk to catcher Salvador Perez and singles by left fielder Alex Gordon and Rios loaded the bases before right-hander Ryan Tepera replaced Hawkins. Orlando entered the game as a pinch runner for Rios. \nEscobar hit a sacrifice fly to the warning track in center. A wild pitch scored another run, Cain hit an RBI single, and Hosmer hit a sacrifice fly. \nEscobar hit his second sacrifice fly of the game in the eighth after the Royals loaded the bases on Tepera. Cain hit a two-run single before Tepera was replaced by right-hander Mark Lowe, who pitched one inning before Pennington took over.NOTES: The Blue Jays' Game 3 win on Monday ended the Royals' nine-game AL Championship Series winning streak, one short of the record held by the Baltimore Orioles. ...
