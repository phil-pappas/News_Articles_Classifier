It’s all downhill against an apparently even more powerful load barreling downhill in Derrick Henry, Alabama’s 6-3, 242 pound running back. \nHenry has netted 570 yards and nine touchdowns on 93 carries for a 6.1 average going into Saturday’s 6 p.m. ESPN televised SEC clash at Alabama’s Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa. \nNo. 8 Alabama is 4-1, 1-1 in the SEC West and Arkansas is 2-3, 1-1 in the SEC West. \nHurd netted 90 on 19 carries but Arkansas obviously held its own to prevail, 24-20 in last Saturday’s SEC game in Knoxville, Tenn. \n“We just got through playing a pretty good back,” Arkansas senior nose tackle DeMarcud Hodge said. “Seems like we get a double dose of these tall, strong guys. But Henry he seems like he’s more of a downhill runner. We have to be sure we get guys in there and have a flat wall defense that gets in there and stops the run.” \nArkansas defensive line coach Rory Segrest and junior middle linebacker Brooks Ellis concur it’s even more uphill vs. Henry running downhill. \n“I feel Henry is a little more physical,” Segrest said. “He’s more of a downhill runner and really presses it up in that tackle box. He is a guy that you are not going to be able to tackle if you are engaged with a blocker. You can’t arm tackle him. You have to be getting off and putting yourself in position to hit him and knock him back.” \nEllis said there is carryover Hurd to Henry. \n“They are very similar backs but Henry likes to go a little more downhill and is very physical back,” Ellis said. “Last week was a good preparation for this week, I think.” \nWhile not as fast as Alabama backup tailback Kenyan Drake, Henry apparently has a pretty big motor in that big body. \n“They have a fast guy and a bigger guy that’s about just as fast,” Arkansas linebackers coach Vernon Hargreaves said. “They are tough to stop.” \nArkansas has a new \nlinebacker trying to stop them. \nStrongside ‘backer Josh Williams broke his leg during the Tennessee game and will be replaced by sophomore Dwayne Eugene in a linebacking triumvirate with Ellis and freshman weakside linebacker Dre Greenlaw. \nAgainst some teams, mostly Spread formations, Arkansas defensive coordinator Robb Smith sparingly uses the Sam ‘backer to play a nickel back. \nAlabama, with Henry, isn’t one of those teams though second-year Alabama offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin did bring some Spread into Coach Nick Saban’s traditionally power running game. \n“Absolutely,” Hargreaves said if he anticipated the Hogs would play more three linebackers than five defensive backs. “We will be in a little bit of both. They will dictate what we are in. If we can get away with playing a little more base, then we will do that.” \nKiffin has brought some wrinkles to the Alabama offense but one aspect of the Tide always flows the same: The offensive line, says senior nose tackle Hodge. \n“I think of Alabama always going back to the core of what they are,” Hodge said. “They do a good job of bringing out the same line. That structure of body they have every year, it’s the same. They always have heavyset guys that can move and move you around. They are just going back to what they are.” \nAfter facing running quarterbacks the past three games, Arkansas faces a more conventional dropback passer in Alabama’s Jake Coker. \n“It’s a little bit different this week in that I think we will be able to work edges more than we have in the past,” Segrest said. d“We have been facing some running quarterbacks so we have been a little hesitant as far pinning our ears back and going. I think Alabama is going to give us some opportunities on occasion and when they do we have to take advantage of them.” \nCoker posted his best game passing when the Tide came off an upset loss at home to Ole Miss by walloping Georgia, 38-10 Between the Hedges in Athens, Ga.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:55:20.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
