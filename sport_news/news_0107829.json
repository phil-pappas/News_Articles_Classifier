Talking to mediapersons after a review meeting on minority affairs schemes in northern states this morning, she said there were some problems in marketing and the reasons were being looked into. “We are looking into the reasons why the youth are getting back to traditional art,” she said. She held that efforts were being made to revive traditional art and craft forms through various programems like skill upgrade with the help of skilled persons under the “Ustaad” scheme. She said focus was on students from the minorities so that they could stand on their feet.
