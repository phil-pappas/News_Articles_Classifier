The 3.1 mile event was the final run leading into the all important Class 3 District 5 race that Moberly will host come 11 days later on Saturday, Oct. 31 with the course taking runners through the wooded areas of Rothwell Park and Howard Hils Athletic Complex. During this Autumn Classic, Moberly got a good taste of what the district meet could be like because runners from Jefferson City Helias and Kirksville - who will be contenders at districts being held at Moberly - also participated at the Mexico 5k event. In fact, both the girls and boys runners from Helias dominated the Autumn Classic, claiming first place in the team standings respectively. Helias girls team garnered just 18 points by having all seven of their runners finish within the Top 10, including five among the first six to complete the course, and the lady Crusaders ran away from the field of competitors. Moberly sophomore Allison Aleshire disrupted the Crusaders’ attempt for a straight flush finish with her third place time of 21:03 minutes. Aleshire and the Lady Spartans team placed second with 63 points and Blair Oaks of Wardsville took third with 93 in the team standings among eight schools. Helias junior Kayla Yanskey and her sophomore teammate Abby Hake led 54 females to the finish line in the varsity race. Yanskey’s time was20:01 to be claimed as the individual champion while Hake was 53-seconds behind her. Moberly sophomore Katie Dalton placed 11th with a time of 21:56. Other finishers for the Lady Spartans are freshman Sydney Flood (16th, 22:53), senior Jordan Fallis (19th, 23:10), freshman Tessa Jackson (20th, 23:19) and senior Olivia Whitson (51st, 30:26). Other girls’ team scores were St. Dominic fourth with 101 points, Mexico had 137, Eldon 147, Centralia 164 and Marion County 215. Senior Malik Holman of Mexico High School was the boys’ individual champion with a time of 16;29. He was 4-seconds quicker to the finish line than Kirksville senior Duncan Clark from a field of 60 runners. Alex Fincher, a freshman, was the first Moberly runner to complete the course. His time was 19:41 minutes to finish 22nd overall. Spartan senior Austin Robertson was 48th (21:59), sophomore Leighton Andrews was 49th (22:13) and freshman Salim Tadrus placed 50th (22:14). Moberly did not have a fifth runner, and as a result did not comprise a team score. Helias won with 28 team points. Mexico had 75 points and Blair Oaks took third with 90.
