Bator beat Lee's Thomas Fraser and Mount Greylock's Ben Gilooly by two strokes to win the tournament. « 2 » \nSTOCKBRIDGE >> As the post-match awards were ready to be passed out, Drury golfer Nick Bator was asked if he thought he could win the Berkshire Classic on Sunday. \n\"Honestly, no,\" Bator said succinctly. \nThe Drury senior let his game do his talking for the most part, shooting a 6-over-par 77 to claim the 2015 Classic by two strokes over Mount Greylock's Ben Gilooly and Lee's Thomas Fraser at Stockbridge Golf Club. \n\"I was really happy with my game,\" said Bator. \"I had a few rough holes, but every shot I hit was pretty much what I wanted.\" \nGilooly and Fraser, both freshmen, finished with 79s. Kyle Alvarez of Greylock was next with 80, followed by Lee's Devyn Olds and Wahconah's Jonathan Dos Santos, who both shot 82. \nThere were 24 golfers in the field. \nGilooly and Fraser both shot 79. Greylock's Kyle Alvarez was next with 80, while Devyn Olds of Lee and Jonathan Dos Santos of Wahconah were tied for fifth at 82. \nIt has been a steady climb for Bator, who finished the Classic tied for eighth two years ago and tied for fourth with a score of 84 last year. \nBator, playing with Pittsfield's Kevin Quinto and Greylock's Matt Wiseman, started his tournament from the first hole. He made the turn in an impressive 2-over-par 38 and started with pars on 10 and 11. But he shot bogeys on the 12th and 13th holes, and the round threatened to get away from him. \nBut a par on the par-3 14th and a birdie on the par-5 15th settled Bator down. Advertisement \n\"I had a bad hole before that, so [the birdie] helped,\" said Bator. \"I wasn't very confident. I've had some rough rounds on this course before.\" \nBator followed the birdie with two bogeys and a par at 18 to finish at 77. \nLee's Fraser had a much different experience. He started the day on the 16th hole and opened his round with three pars and a birdie on the No. 1. \nWhen his day was done, the freshman was sitting at 79 which was a very pleasant surprise. \n\"I was just trying to do the best I could. Seventy-seven is a really good score. I'm happy with a 79,\" said Fraser. \"I really love this course. I love the greens. I was putting good all day. It's such a nice course.\" \nGilooly, another freshman, was in the third group to tee off from No. 1. He was 1-over through the first seven holes, but double-bogeyed No. 8 and 9 to make the turn at 5-over 41. But Gilooly triple-bogeyed the par-4 10th. \n\"That was atrocious,\" he said with a smile. \"That was absolutely atrocious. I don't know what happened. \n\"From there, I tried to recover from it.\" \nGilooly birdied the par-5 15th and par-4 16th and parred home for his 79. \nThere was one four-person group in the Classic, and it consisted of the only two female players at Stockbridge. Wahconah's Colette Basiliere finished with an 87 while Monument Mountain's Lexi Shumsky shot 110. \n\"We had so much fun today. We played together in the girls' Western Mass. tournament,\" said Basiliere. \"It's just a different experience because you have someone who hits like you do. You don't have all the boys, and it's easier to relate and compare yourself to someone else. I don't find it as stressful. \n\"I felt pretty strong. I had a couple of weak shots that left me in a tough position. Other than that, I was hitting everything really well and making a lot of putts.\" \n——— 1. Nick Bator, Drury 38-39 77, 2.
