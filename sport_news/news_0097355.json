(AP) - A 48-year-old Mathews woman serving consecutive life sentences for killing her two young children has lost her bid to overturn her convictions.\nThe Daily Comet reports ( http://bit.ly/1jJSk3d ) the Louisiana Supreme Court on Friday rejected Amy Hebert's claims that her trial attorney provided a constitutionally inadequate defense in 2009. The court concluded that Hebert also failed to show her appeals attorneys ignored issues and that there was no \"reasonable probability\" she would have won on appeal if her attorneys had raised other issues.\nA jury in Thibodaux found Hebert guilty in 2009 of Camille, 9, and son Braxton, 7, at their home.\nHebert pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. Jurors declined to impose a death sentence sought by prosecutors.\nInformation from: The Courier, http://www.houmatoday.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1jJSk3d"], "published": "2015-10-05T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:24:12.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
