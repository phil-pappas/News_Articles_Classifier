He put pressure on his opponents and moving them around and not letting them do a whole lot,\" Yorktown coach Bob Darby said. \"When hitting into the wind, it takes a lot of effort and footwork to actually do well. He did an excellent job, he was hitting good shots into the wind that threw his opponent off.\" \nDarby watched Baldwin earlier in the day during his first match. He saw a strong forehand, backhand and serve. Once the regional portion of the postseason is reached, every opponent is of high quality, meaning there can be no points taken off if a player wants to win. \nThe win improves Landwehr to 23-1 on the season, and he'll play in the state finals on Friday, and if necessary, Saturday. There, he could face Richmond's Eric Hollingsworth, the only player to defeat him in the regular season since his freshman year. \n\"I was not expecting the match to end at 6-1, 6-0. Ian just really took the wind out of his sails,\" Darby said.\" It was very well played and better than what I was expecting with the bad weather.\" 23 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tspne.ws/1LB2M7t TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:38:48.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
