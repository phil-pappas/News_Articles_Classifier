Figuring out how to solve the Devils' problems used to be DeBoer's headache.\nBut he's clearly enjoying his new job.\n\"Love it,\" DeBoer said. \"It's been great, a great group.\"\nA lot has changed since DeBoer was fired by the Devils, with longtime team president and general manager Lou Lamoriello now in Toronto, almost all of the coaching staff replaced and a significant turnover to the roster as well.\n\"It's almost an entirely different team over there or a big portion of it, so [it's] a little different,\" DeBoer said.\nThe Devils were 12-17-7 and nine points out of a playoff spot when DeBoer, 47, was fired. They went 20-19-7 over the rest of the season with Lamoriello and co-coaches Scott Stevens and Adam Oates running the bench, but failed to qualify for the postseason for the third consecutive season and fourth time in five seasons.\n\"There's expectations here, and rightfully so, to win, and I understood everyone's frustration,\" DeBoer said. \"We went through a lot that first half of the year. I'm not an excuse maker, but we dealt with maybe the toughest schedule in the league, injuries, mumps. You're always looking when you get in that spot and you step away [at] what you could have done better. I think they lost their last 12 games in a row to end the season [actually 1-7-3], so that just told me that team just wasn't good enough.\"\nThe biggest plus that came from the coaching change was the emergence of 22-year-old defenseman Adam Larsson, who was given the opportunity to play a much bigger role. DeBoer's reluctance to play some younger players such as Larsson, Eric Gelinas and Jacob Josefson was the biggest knock against him, but he correctly points to other youngsters who were given opportunities.\n\"For every guy that had bumps in the road as a young guy, there was an Adam Henrique or a Jon Merrill or a Damon Severson that played a ton,\" he said. \"So, I don't have any regrets about any decisions we made here.\"\nIn DeBoer's 3 1/2 seasons with the Devils, they went 114-93-41. His 248 regular-season games and 114 wins rank second in team history behind Jacques Lemaire's 509 games and 276 wins, but he reached the playoffs only once – in 2011-12, when the team lost to Los Angeles in the Stanley Cup Final.\n\"I choose my memories to be the real good ones here – beating the Rangers in the [2012] Eastern Conference Finals, going to the Stanley Cup,\" he said. \"I take a lot of comfort in I really felt even to the last game I coached here that the group didn't quit.\"\nBriefs: C Travis Zajac missed practice for the second day in a row with an unspecified injury, but Hynes said he expects him to play tonight. Hynes also said \"there's a good chance\" that G Cory Schneider will play after missing Tuesday's 3-1 loss to Nashville following the birth of his son. … RW Jordin Tootoo was fined $2,217.74 for what the NHL's Department of Player Safety deemed a \"dangerous trip\" of Nashville's Seth Jones in the third period Tuesday.\nEmail: gulitti@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:48:27.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
