The Golden Eagles have won four in a row. \n\"We showed we could handle adversity,\" Welsh said. \"Now we have to show we can handle success.\" \nWilson rolls. Woodrow Wilson (5-2) won its fourth game in a row, beating Cumberland, 36-0, on Friday. \nThe Tigers have outscored their last two opponents by a combined 76-0. They can lock up a berth in the South Jersey Group 3 tournament with a victory at Willingboro on Friday. \n\"So many of our kids are so far removed from the rich tradition we have here,\" said Woodrow Wilson's first-year coach, Preston Brown, a former star player for the Tigers. \"It was my duty to bring back the love and the pride and the passion. \n\"Our kids are starting to believe. They are expecting to perform well. \"I wouldn't be happier with these young men who have made a commitment.\" \nBrown said senior all-purpose Adrian Clark has been a team leader. Clark recently picked up a scholarship offer from Monmouth. \nJunior backs Tyler Parsons and Edwin Lopez and junior linebacker Anthony Ramos have led the Woodrow Wilson defense. \n\"He's our unsung hero,\" Brown said of Ramos. \nBig night. Timber Creek sophomore Devin Leary had the biggest statistical night of his young career at quarterback in the Chargers' 34-6 win over Clearview on Friday. \nLeary was 21 for 29 passing for 317 yards and five touchdowns without an interception. \nTimber Creek coach Rob Hinson said Leary \"easily\" could have passed for more than 400 yards but for a few dropped passes. \"He's really improving,\" Hinson said. \"I have to remind myself that he's only a sophomore.\" \nHonors.
