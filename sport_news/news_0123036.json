He made my life a bit easier on the court today.\n\"I was trying to serve, move him around the court. Just played as much as I needed. It was enough to win,\" the Serbian said after improving to a 13-match winning streak.\nFrench Open champion Stan Wawrinka also maintained his winning run with a 7-6(3) 6-3 victory over Viktor Troicki to set up a third-round contest with Marin Cilic.\nThird seed Andy Murray beat American Steve Johnson 6-2 6-4, Bernard Tomic eliminated seventh seed David Ferrer 6-4 6-2 and Japan's Kei Nishikori overcame Australian Nick Kyrgios 1-6 6-4 6-4.\n(Reporting by Amlan Chakraborty in New Delhi; editing by Toby Davis )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:14:23.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
