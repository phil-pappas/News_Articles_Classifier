It was an open game until the very, very end.”\nAnd then Mexico defender Paul Aguilar literally stole the match out of the sky, ripping a rocket of a volley that with just two minutes left in extra time tore across the U.S. penalty area into goal and through Klinsmann’s and the Americans’ hearts.\nAguilar’s goal gave Mexico a 3-2 victory in the CONCACAF Cup Saturday night, securing in the process a spot in the 2017 Confederations Cup in Russia, FIFA’s dress rehearsal for the World Cup a year later.\nMexico’s first victory against the U.S. since the 2011 Gold Cup final, also at the Rose Bowl, raised further questions about Klinsmann’s future as the U.S. coach. The loss came just hours after the U.S. Under-23 team was upset by Honduras in the CONCACAF Olympic qualifying tournament, a loss that put Team USA’s hopes of reaching the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro next summer in peril.\n“A loss is always difficult to swallow especially when there’s a lot at stake. It means that you have to work even harder than you ever did before in order to turn the results around and make things happen,” Klinsmann said. “So the Olympic team will have to go the tough route and we have to get our group together and rethink the next couple of months.”\nBut not everyone will be aboard the Klinsmman bandwagon.\nEven before the red and green flare smoke had cleared at the Rose Bowl after what many viewed as a must win for the former Germany World Cup hero, Klinsmann’s growing legion of critics among former U.S. players and the media were already taking to social media, pouncing on the latest setback for Klinsmann and the U.S. program in a year that has already seen Team USA lose its final two matches in the Gold Cup and then get run over by Brazil 4-1 last month.\nNot that the criticism seemed to faze Klinsmann.\n“I’m not here to be liked,” he said. “I’m trying to do a good job.\n“You can have your own impression there. You look back the last four years what we did, what we went through and there are only positive moments. We had 2012 great year, 2013 great year, 2014 we got out of the (World Cup) Group of Death and now we have a tough one, this summer and that’s part of it but I leave that up to you.”\nWhat is undeniable is that the U.S. showed a resiliency Saturday that has not always been evident in recent months. Twice the U.S. rebounded from deficits, the second equalizer coming courtesy of a pair of future stars Klinsmann substituted into the match.\nAnd then Aguilar scored a goal for the ages.\n“They showed a lot, lot of character, they showed tremendous effort and they went all the way through and gave everything they had out their on the field,” Klinsmann said of his team. “Coming back twice against Mexico was impressive, but it was not enough.”\nThe deciding play began with a Mexico free kick that was blasted further up the pitch by El Tri defender Miguel Layun. Mexico forward Raul Jimenez then sent the ball soaring high into the sky before landing on the right side of the penalty area where Aguilar drilled a first time volley into the left side of the net.\nAguilar was also involved in what appeared to be the match winning goal earlier in extra-time. Aguilar chased down a long ball down the right flank, stabbing the ball into through a group of U.S. defenders into the top center of the penalty area where Mexico forward Oribe Peralta blasted a shot into the net.\nIt was a pair of youngsters that brought the U.S. back in the 108 th minute. U.S. defender DeAndre Yedlin weaved through traffic, pushing the ball into the final third where he slipped a pass past Mexico defender Arturo Rivas to Bobby Wood, who swooped in past El Tri’s Hector Moreno to get off a first time shot past Mexico goalkeeper Moises Munoz.\nEl Tri, the more aggressive side throughout the opening half, continued to apply the pressure after intermission. Mexico’s up tempo style was nearly rewarded in the 47 th minute when Guzan needed to make a point blank save to rob El Tri forward Jimenez of a go-ahead goal.\nJust inside the hour mark, Jimenez was back deep into U.S. territory, sliding a pass through the penalty area that Javier “Chicharito” Hernandez tried to back heal into the goal but couldn’t quite control.\nMexico struck first just 10 minutes into the match. El Tri right back Paul Aguilar, in what was one of many marauding runs up the right wing, pushed the ball into the U.S. half then drilled a diagonal ball toward the top corner of the box where Mexico forward Oribe Peralta wisely left it for Jimenez before peeling off toward the endline.\nRodriguez shifted the ball wide to Peralta, whose cross found a wide open Hernandez in the center of the box where he knocked the ball into the left side of the goal.\nThe U.S. scored the equalizer five minutes later off a Michael Bradley free kick. From a spot almost to the left sideline and 18 yards out, the U.S. captain’s free kick soared into the center of the box where U.S. defender Geoff Cameron snuck between a pair of Mexican defenders to head the ball into the back of the net.\nBradley nearly put the U.S. twice later in the opening half. The midfielder made a dazzling run in the 32 nd minute into open space in the Mexico penalty area only to pull a weak shot wide of the goal. Then a second Bradley free kick, this time in the 44 th minute, curved toward the near post only to have a diving Mexico goalkeeper Moises Munoz slap the shot wide at the last second.\nIn between U.S. forward Jozy Altidore, wide open in the heart of the box, wasted a nice cross from the Galaxy’s Gysai Zardes, sending a shot way over the goal.\nMexico also had a series of chances. Hernandez in the 35 th minute headed a ball through the penalty area that Guzan reached a split second before a lunging Peralta. This being U.S.-Mexico, the pair became entangled on the ground, Guzan taking offense to something Peralta said or did and charged the El Tri forward touching off an NHL-style scrum on the endline. Peralta received a yellow card for his trouble.\n\nContact the writer: sreid@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:38:35.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
