That year, St. Louis allowed only 472 runs, the fewest of four clubs to yield less than 500.\nTo increase offense, the league lowered the pitching mound the next season. Only twice in a full season has a club been close to 500 since — the 1969 Orioles and 2011 Phillies held opponents to 517 and 529 runs, respectively — but they are about to be joined by a third in the 2015 Cardinals.\nThis year’s St. Louis pitching staff and defense have been stingier than any club in 46 years. They’ve allowed 513 runs in 159 games, which projects to 523 runs at season’s end.\nIt’s a startling statistical accompaniment to the major leagues’ only 100-win season.\n“I don’t think there’s any special formula that we’ve come up with or anything,” third baseman Matt Carpenter said, “but I think we have a group of guys that are throwing the ball really well and guys behind them who make plays.”\nFOR THE WIN\n17 awesome things about the St. Louis Cardinals\nCubs manager Joe Maddon noted his division rival’s outstanding pitching while calling them a strong defensive club, but not an extraordinary one.\n“I think it’s pitching-based, I really do,” Maddon said. “They’re just good arms, skillful and young. I don’t think it’s any more complicated than that.”\nIt may indeed be that simple: great pitching and good defense. A few sophisticated statistics and concepts, however — cluster luck, strand rate, and situational pitching — convolute the assignment of credit a little, but first and foremost, the Cardinals’ depth and development of pitching is indeed unmatched.\nThe Cardinals lost their ace, Adam Wainwright, to an Achilles injury after only 25 innings, yet their rotation’s ERA is still 2.98. That ranks 20th since the 1969 mound lowering, although it is the third-best of the past-quarter century, putting them in the company of such elite rotations as the 2011 Phillies (Roy Halladay, Cliff Lee, Cole Hamels, Roy Oswalt) and the 1992 Braves (Hall of Famers Tom Glavine and John Smoltz, as well as Steve Avery and Charlie Leibrandt).\nThe Redbirds allowed two or fewer runs 79 times — essentially half their games — which is the most by any club since the 1972 Orioles and, before that, a slew of teams in 1968.\nSt. Louis has baseball’s version of Plug & Play Pitching, churning out a seemingly endless array of big league-ready arms. The rotation, for instance, has mostly been comprised of four 20-something Cardinals-developed starters — Carlos Martinez, Michael Wacha, Lance Lynn and Jaime Garcia — while the fifth, veteran John Lackey, was acquired by trading two other homegrown players, pitcher Joe Kelly and first baseman Allen Craig.\nThe three relievers who have logged the most innings this season, closer Trevor Rosenthal and set-up men Kevin Siegrist and Seth Maness, were all drafted-and-developed by the franchise as well.\nThe primary commonality among these pitchers is an emphasis in inducing ground balls. The Cardinals generate grounders on 48.7% of batted balls, per STATS LLC, which ranks third in the majors. St. Louis, which for the first time in history has qualified for five straight postseasons, has ranked in the top-three in ground-ball rate in nine of the past 12 seasons — and ranked No. 1 six times — while making the playoffs nine times, too.\n“They do a nice job of living in the lower quadrant of the zone,” Royals bench coach Don Wakamatsu said. “Obviously Yadi’s got to get some credit, but when they lose good pitching, they always seem to have somebody coming up.”\nThe Cardinals drafted Michael Wacha, who stands 6 feet, 6 inches, 19th overall in 2012. (Photo: Scott Kane, USA TODAY Sports)\nMuch of that is the result of an organizational belief in sinking fastballs but also in pitching on a good downward plane — Wacha, Lackey and Lynn are all 6-5 or 6-6. As minor-league pitching coordinator Tim Leveque said last year, pounding the zone with sinking fastballs has a tangible benefit of generating weak contact and limiting extra-base hits but also a psychological benefit of being aggressive and pitching from ahead in the count.\n“They've got big, physical guys that understand angle, sink and they don’t walk a lot of guys,” Wakamatsu added.\nThe bedrock of the Cardinals’ success in the past decade has been catcher Yadier Molina, a master of game planning, pitch sequencing and steal preventing. Pitchers say they almost never shake off his pitch calls, and the team has allowed the second-fewest steals this season through pitchers’ holding and Molina’s throwing. His value could be further tested if he isn’t able to return from his thumb injury in time for the postseason.\nTheir defense has Gold Glove candidates in Molina and outfielder Jason Heyward but is only top 10 as a unit, according to the Fielding Bible’s defensive runs saved and FanGraphs’ Ultimate Zone Rating, or maybe only top half, per Baseball Prospectus’ park-adjusted defensive efficiency.\nThose fielding numbers could be skewed, however, by how well the Cardinals position their fielders — a process that involves perpetual movement.\nUSA TODAY\nBaseball's culture clash: Vast majority of brawls involve differing ethnicities\n“In the outfield, we’re moving with each pitch, each count‚ kind of positioned in a different place each time,” outfielder Randall Grichuk said.\nSt. Louis doesn’t need to make many spectacular plays because its fielders are already in place. That practice has enabled Jhonny Peralta, with his poor range but steady hands, to be a capable shortstop.\nA look at some wonkier pitching numbers, however, show an inordinate amount of luck, too, but such systemic luck is so consistently an outlier that one wonders if there’s something more to a statistical anomaly.\nTwo component statistics — strand rate and opponents’ batting average with runners in scoring position (RISP) — are both utterly exceptional.\nStrand rate measures a team’s ability to leave opposing runners on base; most pitchers and teams eventually regress to a percentile in the low 70s, with good or bad luck explaining abnormally high or low marks. This year’s Cardinals strand rate of 79.4% is 4.5% better than anyone else this season, according to FanGraphs data, and is the best any pitching staff has recorded since — when else? — 1968.\nSome of that, as first noted by Grantland’s Ben Lindbergh, is attributable to a term called cluster luck, which explains how two clubs with the same number of hits can score differing numbers of runs based on the order and distribution of hits allowed. According to the website The Power Rank, the Cardinals have yielded 101 fewer runs than expected — more than double any other club.\n“There’s absolutely some of that — having luck — but it’s also execution,” general manager John Mozeliak said. “When you think about putting yourself in a position to have success or failure, we’re able to replicate that success over time.”\nA portion of that cluster luck could, in fact, be a matter of tactics, through scouting and game planning to attack hitters a certain way in the game’s most important situations.\nThe Cardinals have allowed a .209 RISP batting average, the best mark in baseball since that infamous 1968 season.\n“Situational pitching is huge and being able to execute your best secondary pitch in the counts that they’re going to be the most aggressive,” St. Louis pitching coach Derek Lilliquist said.\n“You’re trying to expand what (hitters’) strengths would be,” manager Mike Matheny said. “Know where they like the ball and maybe try to expand the plate a little bit in that direction, realizing that they feel the pressure. It’s almost a mental game — which guy can be convinced enough that he’s not the one under pressure? And then it comes down to application.”\nAs much of an outlier as their pitching has been with RISP this year, their lineup was even more of a successful outlier at hitting in those situations two seasons ago with a .330 average that was 19 points higher than any offense in history.\nThe notion of The Cardinals Way gets bandied about liberally and, by opponents, often derisively. When so many historical outliers are produced by one team, however, perhaps there’s a fire underneath all that smoke.\nGALLERY: MLB teams celebrate October rewards\nOct. 1 Rangers relief pitcher Shawn Tolleson is doused with water and Powerade by teammates after Texas clinched a postseason berth.

The Toronto Blue Jays ended baseball's longest playoff drought without even knowing about it. Toronto enters play believing it could clinch a wild card by beating the Tampa Bay Rays, and with losses by Minnesota and the Los Angeles Angels. Not long after the Blue Jays beat the Rays 5-3, Minnesota lost 6-4 at Detroit. But when the Angels defeated Seattle 8-4, it looked as if Toronto would need one more victory Saturday to halt its 22-year postseason absence. It turns out, however, that because of the remaining schedules of the Rangers, Astros and Angels, the Blue Jays had clinched at least a wild-card spot, no matter what.
