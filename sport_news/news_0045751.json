Andrew Seng aseng@sacbee.com i \nrchang@sacbee.com \nA 19-year-old man drowned Sunday afternoon after submerging beneath river waters near Tiscornia Beach on Sunday, county coroners said, adding to a deadly year in the Sacramento region’s waterways. \nThe 1:45 p.m. incident occurred at the confluence of the American and Sacramento rivers, a popular recreation spot that has been the site of several fatal drownings this year. Firefighters responded within 10 minutes and began a comprehensive grid search of the area. \nPer protocol, the victim was transported to UC Davis Medical Center for evaluation because he had been submerged less than an hour, said Roberto Padilla, spokesman for the Sacramento Fire Department. Sacramento County Coroner officials confirmed that Jagjit Basra of Sacramento was pronounced dead at the hospital. \nWitnesses said Basra had been swimming from the beach with a large group of family and friends. Several people on jet skis and boats tried to make rescues prior to the fire operation, said Jonathan Williams, a battalion chief for Sacramento Fire. \nSunday’s death adds to the twelve drownings that have been reported for the two major rivers in Sacramento County this year, more than four times the normal number. \nLower-than-normal river flows have created invitingly warm water and exposed sandy shallows that lure unsuspecting waders into an area of Tiscornia Beach where, close to shore, the river suddenly plunges from waist deep to well over a swimmer’s head, and where the current is so forceful it carries drowning victims a mile downstream to the Tower Bridge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:09:10.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
