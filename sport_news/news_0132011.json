(AP) - Emergency responders, college students and nearly 150 employees came together for Southwestern Vermont Medical Center's first active shooter drill.\nThe Bennington Banner reports Wednesday morning's drill featured a police officer portraying an active shooter in one of the medical center's buildings.\nFollowing the active shooter scenario, employees took part in a second drill in which they cared for multiple injured victims. About 20 Southern Vermont College students donned makeup to portray wounded victims.\nVice President of Corporate Development Leslie Keefe says the exercises were meant to test procedures the hospital has in place for responding to those types of events and to look for areas of improvement.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
