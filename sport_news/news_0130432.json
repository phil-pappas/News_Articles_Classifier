Will the banged-up Cowboys drop their third straight with the 3-0 Pats coming to Dallas? Here are all my picks for Week 5:\nat \nIndianapolis at Houston \nThursday, Oct. 8, 8:25 p.m. ET (CBS/NFL Network) \nThe big issue here is whether Andrew Luck will play with a bum shoulder. If he doesn't, this is a tough task for the Colts , even with a disappointing Texans team on the other sideline. Ryan Mallett stays in as quarterback for the Texans, but will he have a short leash? I think the Colts will find a way, but that's with Luck playing.\nThe Pick: Colts 24, Texans 17\nat \nChicago at Kansas City \nSunday, Oct. 11, 1 p.m. ET (FOX) \nThe Chiefs have lost three consecutive games, two on the road, and they are reeling. They will be happy to get back home against a Bears team that won for the first time last week. The Chiefs pass rush will be too much for Jay Cutler in this one. But the Bears will hang around.\nThe Pick: Chiefs 28, Bears 20\nat \nSeattle at Cincinnati \nSunday, Oct. 11, 1 p.m. ET (FOX) \nSeattle is playing great defense again, but this is a long trip on a short week. That's a bad combination. It's also against one of the best teams in the league right now. I think the Cincinnati front will get after Russell Wilson and his bad line. They will force a turnover or two to win this one. Andy Dalton wins a big game.\nThe Pick: Bengals 24, Seahawks 20\nat \nWashington at Atlanta \nSunday, Oct. 11, 1 p.m. ET (FOX) \nThe Falcons are riding high with a 4-0 start and they can put up points quickly. They have improved up front and that shows up on a weekly basis. Julio Jones was quiet last week, but that will change here. Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins has done some good things, but he has to show consistency here. I think the Falcons get to 5-0.\nThe Pick: Falcons 27, Redskins 17\nat \nJacksonville at Tampa Bay\nSunday, Oct. 11, 1 p.m. ET (CBS) \nThe Jaguars are in the rare position of playing a third consecutive road game. That's always tough, even if it's a short trip. The Bucs looked awful at home last week in losing to the Panthers . I think this game will come down to the two quarterbacks, and I think Blake Bortles will outplay Jameis Winston . Jaguars take it.\nThe Pick: Jaguars 30, Bucs 20\nat \nNew Orleans at Philadelphia\nSunday, Oct. 11, 1 p.m. ET (FOX) \nThis is a game with two teams playing for their seasons. They can't afford to go to 1-4. The Saints looked good last Sunday against the Cowboys, but this is a tough place to play. The Eagles have to show some life, and I think they do it here. Sam Bradford will torch the Saints secondary.\nThe Pick: Eagles 31, Saints 23\nat \nCleveland at Baltimore \nSunday, Oct. 11, 1 p.m. ET (CBS) \nThe Ravens might have saved their season by winning at Pittsburgh 10 days ago, but they come into this one really banged up. Joe Flacco has little help outside in the passing game. The Browns competed hard at San Diego, but now must go on the road again. Can Josh McCown keep it up? I don't think so.\nThe Pick: Ravens 24, Browns 14\nat \nSt. Louis at Green Bay\nSunday, Oct. 11, 1 p.m. ET (CBS) \nThe Rams are playing consecutive road games and Lambeau is a tough place to play. Aaron Rodgers is great at home, but he faces a stiff challenge in the Rams defense. I think he'll be up to it. Rodgers lights it up again at home.\nThe Pick: Packers 30, Rams 14\nat \nBuffalo at Tennessee\nSunday, Oct. 11, 1 p.m. ET (CBS) \nThe Bills are 2-2 and have the look of an inconsistent team. Now they head to play a Titans team that is coming off a bye and is rested. Rex Ryan will throw a ton of looks at Marcus Mariota , but I think he outplays Tyrod Taylor here. The Pick: Titans 17, Bills 14\nat \nArizona at Detroit\nSunday, Oct. 11, 4:05 p.m. ET (FOX) \nThe Lions are now 0-4 and in clear desperation mode. They had their chances at Seattle Monday night, and the defense played really well. But this is a different style of offense. Carson Palmer loves the deep ball. The key will how the Arizona line blocks. I think they will be good enough. Cardinals take it.\nThe Pick: Cardinals 30, Lions 23\nat \nNew England at Dallas\nSunday, Oct. 11, 4:25 p.m. ET (CBS) \nThe Cowboys have major injury issues. Without Tony Romo, they won't be able to keep up with Tom Brady and the New England offense. The Patriots are off a bye, and they will play like it. New England wins big.\nThe Pick: Patriots 37, Cowboys 17\nat \nDenver at Oakland\nSunday, Oct. 11, 4:25 p.m. ET (CBS) \nThe Raiders are home after two straight on the road and play the division-leading Broncos . Denver gets after the passer on defense, so this could be a tough game for Derek Carr . But I think Oakland hangs around being back home after two road games.\nThe Pick: Broncos 21, Raiders 20\nat \nDenver at Oakland\nSunday, Oct. 11, 8:30 p.m. ET (NBC) \nThe 49ers are really struggling on offense and face a long trip East. That's never easy. Colin Kaepernick is really having issues. The Giants seemed to right things last week against the Bills. That will carry over. Eli Manning plays well.\nThe Pick: Giants 31, 49ers 21\nat \nDenver at Oakland\nMonday, Oct. 12, 8:30 p.m. ET (ESPN) \nThis is a long trip for the Steelers , but they will have been off for 10 days. That helps. What won't help is not having Ben Roethlisberger . Mike Vick has to do more than he did against the Ravens. Philip Rivers is playing well, and with Antonio Gates back they will have success against the Steelers defense. Chargers take it.\nThe Pick: Chargers 20, Steelers 13\n\nTom Brady and the Pats will stay perfect in Dallas.
