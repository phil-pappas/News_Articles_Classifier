Maddox Turner, Cutter Sanford and Sam Jackson also added rushing scores, while Colby Miller rushed 15 times for 89 yards. \nThe victory, combined with Buford's defeat of North Oconee, moved the Trojans into a tie for third place in Region 8-AAAA (and they have the head-to-head tiebreaker over the Titans thanks to a win over them earlier in the season) with two contests to play. \nIf their wing-T offense can continue its ascent then North Hall has to like its chances -- the Trojans averaged almost seven yards per carry on Friday. \nMeanwhile, North Hall's defense allowed just 150 total yards to the Purple Hurricanes -- Drew Atha racking up 11 tackles to pace the Trojans, Bacus added seven. \nTurner and Bacus each scored touchdowns in the second quarter to push the Trojans ahead for good, 13-0. Jackson and Sanford also added fourth quarter TDs to seal the contest. \nNorth Hall will play host to Chestatee next week.
