Show Caption Previous Next \nGoalie Bryan Hince has returned to the Knoxville Ice Bears as they prepare to defend their Southern Professional Hockey League title. \nHince, the most valuable player of the 2015 SPHL Playoffs, considered starting his career as a youth hockey coach during the offseason, but opted for another year playing in the SPHL. \nHe reported Sunday for the team orientation meeting and physicals at the Marriott Hotel along with 27 other players who start preseason camp Wednesday. \n\"I'm still fairly young (29) and my body's still intact,\" Hince said. \n\"I love the game, so it was a great opportunity for me to come back and defend the championship.\" \nHince and the other returnees from last year's team were presented their SPHL championship rings during the orientation meeting. Hince, of Ontario, started his pro career with the Ice Bears in 2010-11 after a two-year career at SUNY-Plattsburgh. \nHe will be one of Knoxville's three SPHL veterans — players with 225 or more games in the league — along with defenseman/team captain Jason Price and forward/enforcer Dennis Sicard. \n\"(Hince) is one of the biggest reasons for our success last year in the playoffs,\" Knoxville coach Mike Craigen said. \"We're going to have a pretty young and inexperienced team, and to have a goaltender like Hince as your foundation along with returning defensemen like Price and Bo (Driscoll) is a pretty good start.\" \nKnoxville has seven returnees from the 2014-15 team on the training camp roster: Hince, Price, Sicard, Driscoll, goalie Braely Torris, forward Corey Fulton and forward Josh Cousineau. \nTorris, however, is at training camp with Greenville (S.C.) of the East Coast Hockey League. Torris played eight games with Greenville last year while on loan from the Ice Bears. \n\"I would expect (Torris) back at some point during training camp,\" Craigen said. \n\"If not, I've got a pretty good young goaltender in here from the University of Toronto in Garrett Sheehan. I'm pretty comfortable with the way things are right now. I like the way our training camp roster shaped up.\" \nThe Ice Bears have two-a-day practices Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, and play an exhibition against Fayetteville on Saturday night at 7:35 at Civic Coliseum. \nKnoxville plays an exhibition Sunday at the Mississippi RiverKings, has its season opener Oct. 23 at Macon and its home opener Oct. 24, against Columbus. \nTwo of Knoxville's latest signees are right wing Shawn Skelly and right wing Bret Peppler, and both have plenty of SPHL experience. \nSkelly started his SPHL career with the Mississippi Surge in 2011-12 and last season played for three SPHL teams: Peoria, Fayetteville, and Louisiana. He's spent significant time in the ECHL, including 25 games last year with the Wheeling (W.Va.) Nailers. \n\"He's a power-play specialist,\" Craigen said. \"He is here to help our power play. He's got a great shot. With his shot, and his ability to get open in our arena, I think he's going to really help with the special teams side of things.\" \nPeppler, 30, played for Louisiana the past two seasons and began his SPHL career in 2005-06 with Jacksonville. \n\"Peppler is a great character guy,\" Craigen said. \"He will be a big help in the locker room for us, not to mention he can put the puck in the net.\" \nCraigen said three players from Knoxville's 2014-15 roster, Francis Drolet, Jake Johnson, and Matthew Paton, are playing in Europe and are protected by the Ice Bears. They could rejoin Knoxville with a cutoff date of Jan. 1. Dave Link is a freelance contributor. Copyright 2015 Journal Media Group. All rights reserved.
