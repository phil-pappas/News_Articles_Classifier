The Cowboys, who will play at the New Orleans Saints on Sunday night, will be without Tony Romo at least until the Nov. 22 game at the Miami Dolphins as he recovers from a broken left collarbone. 50 things we learned from Week 3 of the NFL season \nThrows down the field Sunday were few and far between. Weeden threw long to tight end Jason Witten, who ran a seam route, but the pass was not perfectly placed. And it appeared as if he had opportunities to throw to wide receiver Terrance Williams at times but decided not to. \nWhen asked if his wide receivers won enough in their individual battles with Atlanta’s defensive backs off the line of scrimmage, Garrett said, “Yeah, there were one-on-one situations out there. We weren’t efficient enough in the passing game.” \nStephen Jones, the Cowboys executive vice president, said on KRLD-FM in Dallas on Monday that the game plan was “we could work the underneath part of their coverage and run the football. Of course, the first half we did that real well. I think you got to give the Falcons a lot of credit – they adjusted. We didn’t probably adjust as well as we needed to. We probably needed to be going to the outside group [of wide receivers] as they changed and adjusted there in the second half.” 'Joe Philbin must be fired' and other Week 3 overreactions in the NFL \nGarrett said Weeden’s second-quarter interception was a “really poor decision” and the “one real blemish” in his performance. On the subsequent drive, Atlanta scored a touchdown to cut the Cowboys’ lead to seven points. \nGarrett took exception to the notion that the Cowboys needed to specifically attack more deep down the field, citing the style of Atlanta’s defense. He said that the Falcons almost exclusively commit a lot of players to the line of scrimmage and use their cornerbacks to play high and deep, negating most big plays. \n“There were some opportunities to throw the ball outside to the outside receivers that we didn’t take full advantage of,” Garrett said. “To say we should have thrown it down the field more, I don’t know that’s accurate.” \nFollow Eric Prisbell on Twitter @EricPrisbell . \nPHOTOS: Best of NFL Week 3 Green Bay Packers wide receiver Randall Cobb (18) celebrates a touchdown by jumping into the stands during the first quarter against the Kansas City Chiefs at Lambeau Field.
