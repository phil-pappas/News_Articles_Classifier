Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals, whose owners had been suspended by a Supreme Court-appointed committee for two years for their misdemeanours, will return to the IPL in 2018. Over the next two sessions, though, the number of the IPL team will remain eight – the BCCI has decided to invite bids for two new IPL franchises to replace Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals. The new bids will be invited for only two years, and it wasn’t made clear if the two new teams will continue to be part of the IPL after the return of Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals in 2018. These decisions were taken during the BCCI’s working committee meeting in Mumbai today. The BCCI today announced that it will implement fully the interim report of the Justice Lodha Committee, which had been formed by the Supreme Court in January this year. “The Justice Lodha committee interim report will be implemented fully. The two franchise teams, Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals, remain suspended for two years,” the BCCI said in a statement today. “BCCI will float tenders and invite bids for two new teams to replace CSK and RR in the Indian Premier League for 2016 and 2017.” The Justice Lodha Committee had been given the task of deciding the penalties to be imposed on CSK and RR, and their team officials/part-owners Gurunath Meiyappan and Raj Kundra. In July, committee had recommended that the franchise owners of the two IPL teams be suspended for two years. The BCCI announced that PepsiCo, the title sponsors of the IPL, had parted ways with the tournament. Earlier this month, PepsiCo had sent a notice to the BCCI, informing that it would withdraw its title sponsorship because the spot-fixing controversy had “brought the sport to disrepute”. PepsiCo had won the sponsorship contract in 2012, for a five-year duration of 2013 to 2017. The title sponsorship has been now given to Vivo Mobiles. “Vivo is to give the bank guarantee in next ten days,\" the BCCI said announced. AGM on Nov 9\nAmong the other decisions, the working committee announced that the annual general meeting of the BCCI will be held on November 9. Also, the National Cricket Academy (NCA) will be revived on a priority basis. The BCCI statement said that the board is mulling an offer by the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB). “Revival of the National Cricket Academy as the centre of excellence is the top-most priority of the BCCI. The board will look at the lands offered by KIADB. MP Pandove (NCA chairman), Rajeev Shukla (IPL chief), Anirudh Chaudhry (BCCI treasurer) and Amitabh Choudhary (BCCI joint secretary) will inspect the lands offered by KIADB and finalise the deal within one month,” the statement added. The BCCI announced that M/s Gokhale & Sathe will be the new internal auditors of the board, replacing M/s P.B Vijayragahavan & Company. The BCCI also appointed M/S Deloitte for “Project Transformation”, and PricewaterhouseCoopers as the “independent agency for due diligence on the utilisation of funds provided to the state associations”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:01:34.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
