Sefolosha had nothing to do with the stabbing but was charged with resisting arrest, obstruction and disorderly conduct.Sefolosha suffered a season-ending leg injury, and while his attorney conceded Sefolosha called a police officer a \"midget,\" the defense argued he was the victim of excessive force by an officer with \"implicit racial biases.\" \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
