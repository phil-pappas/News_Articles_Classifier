A big ol' fella that can really run.” \nThough Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi acknowledges that Beamer has seen his share of talented running backs, he respectfully disagrees with Beamer’s glowing assessment. \n“You know what, they might be the same size, but you can't compare the ACC player of the year to any other tailback that we have on our team right now,” Narduzzi said. “Until you've done that, you're really not there. Coach Beamer is being kind.” \nOllison’s Pitt career began with a 207-yard performance against Youngstown State, a game in which he replaced an injured Conner after the first quarter. His rushing totals have decreased in each game since. \nOllison rushed for 81 yards in his first start, at Akron, but his per-carry average dipped to 3.9. He was replaced in the starting lineup by freshman Darrin Hall when Pitt traveled to Iowa two weeks ago and carried the ball just four times for 22 yards in a 27-24 loss. \nThe Panthers’ team rushing numbers have taken a hit as well, slipping from 325 yards against Youngstown State to 127 against Akron before bottoming out at a mere 55 yards at Iowa. Likewise, the team’s yards per carry average has plummeted from 7.6 to 2.8 to 2.0. \n“It wasn’t good enough,” Narduzzi said of Pitt’s running game in the loss to Iowa. \nThe running game has become so unsettled in the wake of Conner’s season-ending injury that Narduzzi and offensive coordinator Jim Chaney are unable to commit to a starter on the eve of their ACC opener against Virginia Tech. \nOllison, Hall and sophomore Chris James — who is finally healthy after rushing for nearly 500 yards as Conner’s backup last season — are listed on the depth chart as co-starters. \n“I wish it was not (co-starters),” Narduzzi said. “I wish No. 24 (Conner) was back there, but he’s not. So, obviously, it’s just a work in progress and we have to go with the hot guy.” \nHall, a four-star recruit from Youngstown, has slowly but steadily become a bigger part of the offense each week. \nAfter getting three carries in the season-opener, Hall ran 12 times for 52 yards and a touchdown against Akron before getting the start at Iowa. He had 14 carries for 38 yards as the Panthers struggled to find rushing lanes against the Hawkeyes. \n“I think he did a good job,” Narduzzi said of Hall’s first start. “He didn’t run the ball like how we wanted him to run it, but it was a good front on Iowa. We knew it wasn’t going to be easy to run the ball against them.” \nNarduzzi said the backs aren’t the sole reason for the running game’s struggles. The offensive line, which lost right tackle Jaryd Jones-Smith before the season, has also dealt with an injury to left tackle Adam Bisnowaty and the slow recovery of center Artie Rowell from a 2014 ACL tear. \n“Obviously, we’re missing some guys up front and we’re missing a great tailback that can make people miss,” Narduzzi lamented. “There are just a lot of guys who don’t have a lot of experience back there. We have to get better and we have to keep pushing forward. We have to run the ball more effectively.” \nUntil the rushing numbers start to rebound, Narduzzi isn’t willing to compare any of Pitt’s three young tailbacks to Conner. \n“They've got a lot of proving to do in the backfield, whether it's Qadree or Darrin Hall or James,” he said. “We'll find out at the end of the year. If they're an ACC player of the year, then we can compare them.” \nPitt running backs still a question mark", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:52:03.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
