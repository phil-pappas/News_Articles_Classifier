I thought tonight we were just putting time in. We weren’t ready to push. We were happy to defend. We let them bring the game to us.”\nAnd so the Oilers are 0-3, spoiling what was supposed to be a great moment for the kid and wasting a sensational effort from Nilsson, who deserved to walk out of the American Airlines Center with a win.\nNot that the Oilers, who were outshot 52-27, deserved a win, but it would have been nice.\n“Congratulations to Connor, it’s something he’s been waiting his whole life for, and Nilly played great for us between the posts,” said Oilers winger Matt Hendricks. “But as a group we have to look in the mirror because we gave them 40 minutes of hockey for free.\n“Those first 40 minutes … there’s no excuse for that.”\nMcLellan didn’t like a lot of key areas of his team, like the Taylor Hall, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins line and a lot of his defence, which is kind of disheartening in the third game of the season when the team was already 0-2.\n“I think we’re a better team that we showed,” he said. “We had some key people who weren’t engaged in the game and we had others who were overwhelmed in the game and that’s the result we’re going to get when that happens.\n“I wasn’t disappointed in St. Louis or Nashville with their approach to the game, I thought they gave us what they had, but I don’t believe that happened tonight.”\nBut, hey, McDavid scored, which turned out to be the highlight of the road trip.\nAfter five pre-season games and two regular season games without a goal, he finally has his first of many.\n“It’s something pretty special, something I’ll remember for the rest of my life,” said McDavid. “Obviously not the way you want to end that game, but pretty special to get it out of the way.\n“I was excited, but a lot of it was relief, just with the pressure there is these days. It felt good.”\nBut McDavid was quick to point out that he won’t be leaving Dallas feeling any sort of good about the way Tuesday night went, or this whole trip went, for that matter.\n“It’s not about me at all,” he said. “It’s about the team, and this was a very disappointing road trip.”\nNilsson kept the Oilers alive through their brutal start, limiting the damage to 2-0 on goals from Jason Spezza (on the Stars 16th shot of the first period) and Jamie Benn early in the second.\nThe McDavid line fought back, however, scoring on back to back shifts.\nOscar Klefbom got it going with a point shot that deflected in off of Vern Fiddler at 10:55 and McDavid tied it with a deflection of his own, on Andrej Sekera’s point shot at 12:18.\nThis one had loss written on it from the start, though, and the end came when Spezza put a wrist shot through Nilsson’s five hole at 15:30 of the third period, on Dallas’s 48th shot.\nSpezza completed his hat-trick with an empty netter, and Nilsson has to walk away with a loss.\n“Anders made some tremendous saves,” said McLellan. “On one or two goals he’s like to have them back but I don’t know how you can be disappointed in his performance.”\nFollow me on twitter.com/sun_tychkowski\nrobert.tychkowski@sunmedia.ca\nGAME REVIEW\nStars 4, Oilers 2\nTHREE STARS\nJason Spezza ,DAL - Scores the first, third and fourth Dallas goals in the win\nAnders Nilsson , EDM - He was a brick wall when the embattled Oilers needed one\nJamie Benn , DAL - Delivers a strong game and scores a nice goal for Dallas\nGAME GRADES\nGAME D\nOffence C\nDefence D\nGoaltending A\nPower Play C\nPenalty Killing A\nToughness B\nEffort B\nWHY THEY LOST\nBecause they showed up late and their defensive shortcomings resulted in long, drawn out periods spent under siege.
