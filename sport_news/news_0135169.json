Out of Frank Gore's shadow, Hyde rushed for 168 yards and two touchdowns in a Week 1 victory and has 375 rushing yards. Harbaugh called the left side of the 49ers' offensive line, which features guard Alex Boone and tackle Joe Staley, the best in the league. (EDGE: 49ERS) \nRUSH DEFENSE \nRAVENS: Teams continue to sprinkle in some runs to keep the Ravens defense honest, but aside from the Pittsburgh Steelers, nobody has gained a whole lot of traction on the ground. The Ravens haven't been impenetrable, but they are holding teams to 100.4 rushing yards per game, 14th in the NFL. Inside linebacker Daryl Smith is fifth in the NFL with 46 tackles. The Ravens will focus on stopping 49ers running back Carlos Hyde and keeping quarterback Colin Kaepernick in the pocket. \n49ERS: Big up front with Glenn Dorsey and Ian Williams and with active linebackers in NaVorro Bowman and Michael Wilhoite behind them, the 49ers run defense ranks 17th in the NFL, allowing 108 yards per game. They've allowed one 100-yard rusher — Arizona's Chris Johnson had 110 yards and two touchdowns on 22 carries in Week 3. Bowman, who spent all of last season on injured reserve while rehabilitating a knee injury, leads the team with 44 tackles. (EDGE: RAVENS) \nPASS DEFENSE \nRAVENS: This group continues to be a mess, incapable of getting consistent pressure on the quarterback, making stops on third down or avoiding crushing penalties. The Ravens rank 25th in the NFL in pass defense, allowing 278.2 yards per game. They are allowing teams to convert on 49.4 percent of third-down opportunities, the second-worst mark in the NFL. Coach John Harbaugh brought in three cornerbacks this week in an overhaul of a shaky secondary. Will it matter? \n49ERS: Like the Ravens, the 49ers defense has been picked apart by opposing quarterbacks. San Francisco has allowed 300-yard passers in three of the past four games. The 49ers are giving up 298.8 passing yards per game, the third highest total in the NFL. In last week's loss to the Giants, they allowed Eli Manning to throw for 441 yards and three scores. Cornerbacks Kenneth Acker and Tramaine Brock have struggled. Outside linebacker Aaron Lynch is the only 49er with more than one sack. (EDGE: EVEN) \nSPECIAL TEAMS \nRAVENS: Signed off the practice squad, Jeremy Ross gave the Ravens return game a boost last week, averaging 27.2 yards on five kickoff returns and 10.5 yards on two punt returns. Assuming he keeps protecting the football — ball security had been an issue — Ross should remain the Ravens' primary return man. Sam Koch had a strong day punting against the Browns but Justin Tucker missed a 51-yard field goal and three special teams penalties hurt the Ravens' field position. \n49ERS: Reggie Bush is listed as one of the 49ers' top return options. However, he's yet to return a punt or kick. Rookies DeAndrew White and Jarryd Hayne, the former Australian rugby star, have handled return duties. Veteran kicker Phil Dawson, who never seemed to miss against the Ravens during his days with Cleveland, is 6-for-7 on field-goal attempts this season. Replacing the traded Andy Lee, rookie punter Bradley Pinion is averaging 44.5 yards per punt. (EDGE: RAVENS) \nINTANGIBLES \nRAVENS: Harbaugh faces one of the biggest tests of his Ravens' tenure, needing to keep his reeling 1-4 team focused on getting a rare road win. The Ravens haven't proved they can finish and put a full game together. They have won four consecutive matchups with the 49ers and Harbaugh's team has prevailed in six straight games against NFC foes. However, few of their positive streaks have stayed intact through this year's difficult start. Injuries and penalties have killed this team. \n49ERS: After a turbulent offseason, the 49ers opened the year with a dominant, 20-3, victory over the Minnesota Vikings. However, the 49ers have since lost four in a row and really only one of those games, last week against the Giants, was close. The Kaepernick-led offense ranks 29th in the NFL and the defense ranks 31st. The 49ers have played hard under Jim Tomsula and they are one of the least penalized teams in the NFL, but execution has been poor. (EDGE: RAVENS) \nPREDICTION \nThe Ravens' four losses by a total of 17 points suggest that the team is not far from putting some wins together. The 49ers, meanwhile, have been outscored by 82 points in their four defeats. Still, it's impossible to trust the Ravens at this point, even against a struggling opponent. When you are beaten by Cleveland and Oakland, you lose all benefit of doubt. The bet here is that the game evolves into a field-goal fest and the Ravens are again unable to pull out a close one late. 49ers, 23-16", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:39:53.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
