Stacy Long , Montgomery Advertiser 7:02 a.m. CDT October 2, 2015 Troy quarterback Brandon Silvers (12) warms up prior to the game against Louisiana-Lafayette at Veterans Memorial Stadium in Troy, Ala. on Saturday, November 29, 2014. (Photo: Chip Dillard/Special to the Montgomery Advertiser) \nLine: Troy by 6 (as of Tuesday) \nRecords: Troy (1-2, 0-0 Sun Belt), USA (2-2, 0-0) \nOn the air: TV — none; Radio — WTXK-FM 107.5, WTXK-AM 1210, WACQ-FM 101.1, WACQ-AM 580, WTBF-FM 94.7 \nTwitter: @AStacyLong, @MGMsports \nFOUR-DOWN TERRITORY Troy quarterback Brandon Silvers, who is from Gulf Shores, hopes to atone for last year's bad game against South Alabama. Stacy Long \n1. Face time: Troy quarterback Brandon Silvers may have a little more on the line Saturday, like whether he can show his face at home or not. Silvers is from Gulf Shores and was embarrassed by how he played last year at South Alabama. “I didn’t play well at all last year, so I have been thinking about it a lot,” Silvers said. “I can’t wait to get started.” Silvers threw two interceptions, still a career high, and 156 yards passing, a career low at that point. “It’s not really a redemption-type thing,” Silvers said, “but I really want to focus and practice well this week and have a good game.” Troy coach Neal Brown says fans shouldn't compare scores between Troy's and South Alabama's games against North Carolina State. Stacy Long \n2. Common foe: Though South Alabama and Troy will “battle for the belt,” North Carolina State has taken both teams’ scalp. The Wolfpack, after opening the season with a 49-21 home win over the Trojans, beat the Jaguars 63-13 in Mobile last weekend. “Typically, when you take a loss like that, it either brings your team together or it destroys you,” USA running back Tyreis Thomas said. “I think, with our family here, it’s definitely going to bring us together.” \n3. Blackout: The Trojans have declared a “blackout” for Saturday’s game and will wear special all-black uniforms. Maybe it will turn out better than their last “blackout.” On Halloween 2013, Troy lost 49-37 to Louisiana-Monroe. It was the first time the Trojans had donned black jerseys since an October 2005 win over Florida International on Al Lucas Day. \n4. League lidlifter: Both Troy and South Alabama are playing their Sun Belt Conference openers Saturday. “This is the opening of the season for us,” said Troy coach Neal Brown, who had referred to the three non-conference games that started the year as “preseason.” “We’re lucky to start it with a rivalry game.” \nPLAYER OF THE WEEK \nDalton Bennett \nC, 6-3, 301, Sr. \nBennett, who turns 24 on Monday, didn’t react well the last time the Trojans wore all-black uniforms. He was ejected during the 2013 loss to Louisiana-Monroe after a third-quarter verbal confrontation with umpire Tyrone Blanks. Troy defensive coordinator Vic Koenning says he tries to not get too amped for rivalry games like Saturday's between the Trojans and South Alabama. Stacy Long \nBY THE NUMBERS \n20-1: Troy’s home record against in-state teams since the 1990 season. Hello, 2005 UAB Blazers. \n586: School-record yards allowed by South Alabama in last week’s 63-13 home loss to North Carolina State. \n561: Previous school record set two weeks earlier in a 48-9 loss at Nebraska. \n63: School-record points allowed by South Alabama to North Carolina State. \n751: School-record yards allowed by Troy in its 2013 loss at Ole Miss. Troy offensive coordinator Kenny Edenfield is excited that the Trojans and South Alabama have named their rivalry the \"Battle for the Belt.\" Stacy Long \nPREDICTION \nThe mascots have been warily gazing at each other for years. Maybe T-Roy and SouthPaw, after one wrests title to the rivalry’s “Battle for the Belt” actual belt, should put it to good use, birthday- or Kevin Bacon/”Animal House”-style. By Sunday, the strapmarks should still be red and aching. Poor SouthPaw. Assume the position. Troy 39, South Alabama 36.
