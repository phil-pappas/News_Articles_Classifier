There were a lot of troubling defensive stats. Big plays and third down, as I highlighted in my sidebar. Allowing 368 rushing yards (6.3 yards per carry) and five touchdowns on the ground. Not forcing a turnover. But one of the biggest concerning themes of the season so far has been the lack of pass rush from the defensive line. OSU is currently tied for 113th nationally in that category (1.2 per game), just one season after Kalani Sitake's terrorizing unit at Utah led the nation in quarterback takedowns.\nThe Beavers tallied just one sack (which also served as the line's only tackle for loss) and zero quarterback hurries against the Wildcats. Yes, Anu Solomon is mobile. But so are a lot of spread quarterbacks in the Pac-12. With Sitake needing to simplify some aspects of the defense — we saw less blitzing Saturday — the line has to get a better push by itself.\n2. OSU's only drive that lasted longer than 2:12 was the second-quarter touchdown. Of course, that's not because the Beavers were zipping around and down the field like the Wildcats. Here was OSU's final drive chart: Punt, punt punt, touchdown, interception, punt, punt, end of half, punt, downs, punt, punt punt. The seven points were the fewest Arizona's defense has allowed since 2010.\n3. Seth Collins is going to have clunkers like Saturday. It's part of starting a true freshman quarterback. Still, just how badly the offense performed (especially against Arizona's previously terrible defense) was perplexing, given that offensive coordinator Dave Baldwin was so adamant about the offense being close to breaking through — and I took his comments as completely genuine.\nFollowing the game, Collins walked a bit gingerly off the field after sustaining a leg injury in the second quarter but was obviously healthy enough to return after halftime. I wonder, though, if there will be any extra precautions taken to try to help Collins avoid hits and stay healthy during the heart of the season. Given the nature of Collins' game and the Beavers' offense, however, there's only so much one can do besides stressing sliding and getting out of bounds when possible.\n4. I actually thought Marcus McMaryion looked pretty solid while stepping into emergency duty late in the second quarter. He directed a nice drive at the end of the half to try to get the Beavers into scoring range, but just ran out of time. Still, those were meaningful game reps for the redshirt freshman, and another example that he needs to be ready to play at all times.\n5. Baker Pritchard got the start at defensive end (Titus Failauga had been dinged up throughout the week but did play Saturday) and true freshman Noah Togiai started at H-back. It was both players' first-career start.\n6. If the game participation portion of the official game book is correct, true freshman defensive lineman Elu Aydon played Saturday, thus burning his redshirt. I don't remember seeing him out there, but that doesn't mean he wasn't.\n7. Now that running back Deltron Sands is out for the season, Datrin Guyton stepped in on kickoff returns. It did not start out well, as a fumble on his first return — a ball he probably should not have taken out of the end zone — was overturned because he was down. Crisis averted, but still, even I could see his bad ball security from all the way up in the press box. OSU has yet to break a big return on a punt or kickoff and has made some puzzling decisions in that area so far this season.\n8. I wrote about Devin Chappell this week and his increased role at nickelback now that the Beavers will be facing a bunch of wide-open offenses that line up with a ton of receivers. He finished with five tackles (four solo) and made at least one nice stop in the open field.\n9. Brent VanderVeen's juggling 14-yard catch on the Beavers' touchdown drive was the first of his career.\n10. Overheard in the press box: \"Paul Lucas finally has a stat.\" The true freshman speedster tallied three carries for 13 yards. He's still awaiting his first catch.\n11. Brandon Arnold has started getting more meaningful snaps at safety and finished with four tackles (0.5 for loss).\n12. These officials possibly picked up more flags and overturned more calls than I've ever seen.\n13. The hit by Will Parks on receiver Jordan Villamin was completely legal, yet one of the most violent I've ever seen.\n14. Running back Storm Barrs-Woods hit another milestone Saturday, becoming the sixth back in OSU history to run for more than 2,500 yards. He now sits at 2,505 yards and is 48 away from passing Dave Schilling for fifth on OSU's all-time list.\n15. It is going to be fascinating to watch how players and coaches now respond following this drubbing. As noted before, even in the Beavers' previous losses, there were positive signs of growth. This was just an awful performance. Sometimes, these types of games serve as wake-up calls and push everybody to make corrections and improve. Sometimes, they do the opposite.\nFour plays you may have forgotten\n1. The highlight play of Arizona's opening drive was the 50-yard bomb from Solomon to David Richards, where he made the catch despite being grabbed by Larry Scott. But what about the Wildcats' first third-down conversion of the day? Solomon had thrown two consecutive incomplete passes to start the drive and put Arizona in third-and-10. But then Cayleb Jones was left wide open in the middle of the field to pick up 14 yards and move the sticks. It set the tone for the entire day.\n2. Third down was also key on the Beavers' only touchdown drive, as they truly converted two and then got another first because of a personal foul penalty. Perhaps the most impressive conversion was a Ryan Nall two-yard run on third-and-1, where his second effort is what got him past the marker. He finished with eight carries for 30 yards in his second game with notable action.\n3. How about that random first-quarter play by Arizona, where Jones caught a pass at the OSU 24 and then flipped it back to Solomon? I wrote \"huh?\" in my notes. Arizona ended that drive with a field goal.\n4. On third-and-10 from the OSU 32 in the second quarter, Solomon found Richards for 11 yards and a first down. The Wildcats' receivers were excellent all day at running right to the sticks. That play was part of a 15-play, 65-yard drive that ate up 4:42 of clock and extended the Wildcats' lead to 34-7. The game was already out of hand before that possession, but a more methodical drive (by Arizona's quick-strike standards) like that just asserted the Wildcats' dominance.\nQuotable\n\"I have no idea. We'll sit back and see. The team we just played had two very bad losses, and they sure bounced back and did a nice job. We'll all get questioned with our toughness and our care factors. When you get knocked down, it's how you come back and see where you're at.\" -- Andersen on if he thinks Saturday's performance was an aberration\nTweets of the game\nReally hope Seth Collins isn't the next Chuckie Keeton. So fast and athletic. But man, he takes a lot of hits.\n— Kevin Gemmell (@Kevin_Gemmell) October 10, 2015 This was before Collins' injury. @ginamizell Guess they were tears of joy Wilma was hiding in her paws.\n— BA (@beavba) October 10, 2015 A fan owns up to an incorrect prediction.
