Bergner's first three field goals staked South Dakota (4-3, 2-2 Missouri Valley) to a 9-0 lead in the first quarter. Missouri State's Deion Holliman fielded a Bergner kickoff in the end zone and ran it back 100 yards to make the score 9-7, but then Ryan Saeger, who completed 20 of 29 passes for 275 yards, hit Eric Shufford for a 34-yard score that boosted the lead to 16-7 by halftime. Holliman's 100-yard return for a score was a school-record fourth. The Coyotes owned the second half, outscoring Missouri State 24-3. Nine South Dakota players rushed for 249 yards. Michael Fredrick leading with 129 yards and a TD on 22 carries. Two Missouri State (1-6, 0-4) quarterbacks combined for 41 yards passing.
