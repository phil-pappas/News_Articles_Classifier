With the backing of his promoter Team Sauerland and manager Michael Amoo-Bediako, Commey has set his sights on the division’s top talents as he aims to prove he is ready for a world title challenge. \n“I want to become world champion,” said Commey. “And with the help of my team and the grace of God, I will make this dream a reality. There are a lot of fighters out there who say they are world class but are afraid to fight me. I’m willing to face anyone to show I’m ready to challenge for world titles. \n“I’m very thankful for the opportunity to come to the UK. There are great facilities here at the Pro SW Gym, which will help me to get the perfect preparations for my fight on October 17. The lightweight division is very strong here too. There are a lot of talented fighters and I want to test myself against the best of them. \n“If I could chose one lightweight from the UK to fight it would be Derry Matthews. He had the chance to fight me for the Commonwealth title but he avoided me. I know he is tough but I want to find out how tough he really is!’’ \nCommey will be cutting short his preparations for his upcoming fight to fly back home to Ghana to receive the prestigious Sports Writers Association of Ghana (SWAG) award for ‘Professional Boxer of the Year 2015’. \nWith the list of previous winners including Azumah Nelson, Ike Quartey, Joshua Clottey and Joseph Agbeko, who all went on to win World titles, Commey will be in good company. \nThe ceremony takes place on Saturday, October 3 at Banquet Hall, State House in the countries capital Accra and will be broadcast live on national television. \n“It is a massive honour for me to receive this award,’’ said Commey. \n\"A lot of great Ghanaian fighters have won this award and gone on to become world champions. This gives me a lot of encouragement and belief that I can follow in their footsteps and become Ghana’s next world champion.” \nOn October 17, Commey will be fighting on the undercard of interim WBA World Champion Vincent Feignbutz’s super middleweight showdown with Giovanni De Carolis. “Richard will be an exciting addition to our show on October 17 in Karlsruhe,’’ said promoter Nisse Sauerland. \n\"I think the German audience will really appreciate his all action style. There are a lot of big fights in the making for him and we’re confident he has the talent to go all the way!” \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
