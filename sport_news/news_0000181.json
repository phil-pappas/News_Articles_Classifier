Colin and Will Daly of River Dell first drew national attention last spring when they led the Golden Hawks to fifth place in the Penn Relays 4-x-800 meter relay at Franklin Field on the campus of the University of Pennsylvania.\nSo it’s fitting that the senior twins announced their verbal commitment to the Quakers track and cross-country teams Wednesday.\n“There’s something about the first school that shows interest in you and coach [Steve] Dolan of Penn was the first coach to contact us last fall in cross-country,” said Will Daly, who placed second in the state Meet of Champions 1,600 last spring. “We made our first unofficial visit there last year and I think we knew that it was going to be the place for us.”\n“We didn’t want a huge campus and we liked the city of Philadelphia, said Colin, who ran key legs on the Golden Hawks’ third place distance medley and fifth place 4-x-800 teams at the National championships last June. “It fits what we want to do academically and we’re sure the coaches can get us where we want to be as athletes.”\nIvy League schools do not adhere to the National Letter of Intent, so the process, which actually started when the Dalys submitted their junior year transcripts for an Ivy pre-read before their official visit Sept. 18-19. Their early decision application is due Nov. 1, but if they apply earlier they can receive a “Likely” letter confirming their likely admittance before that date, with the official decision due Dec. 15.\n By Ivy League rules, they can not be considered committed recruits until after they send the deposit confirming their intention to attend the school -- the Ivy equivalent of the National Letter of Intent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:06:57.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
