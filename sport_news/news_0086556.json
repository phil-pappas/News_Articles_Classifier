Before this rout ends, I'm expecting #MapleLeafs to start throwing blows at #RedWings because \"if you can't beat 'em, fight 'em\" — Larry Lage (@LarryLage) October 10, 2015 \nRed Wings 4, Maple Leafs 0 (8:01): Maple Leafs back on the power play when Gustav Nyquist goes off for tripping. Can you smell it? There's a life force in here tonight. #LGRW #NHLFaceOff pic.twitter.com/QjRHu90Sf0 — Detroit Red Wings (@DetroitRedWings) October 10, 2015 \nRed Wings 4, Maple Leafs 0 (11:08): Kyle Quicey goes off for leveling Brad Boyes after he dropped Mike Green with a clean check. Quincey ets a roughing penalty. 4-0!!! Keep it rolling Detroit!! — Mike Commodore (@commie22) October 10, 2015 \"Go home Babcock!\" some fans were just chanting. And, I don't think they are referring to his house on a lake in suburban Detroit. — Larry Lage (@LarryLage) October 10, 2015 Sure, things aren't starting out well for #leafs , but at least Toronto has success off the #BlueJays to distract them . . . oh never mind. — Bob Duff (@asktheduffer) October 10, 2015 \nRed Wings 4, Maple Leafs 0 (16:06): There's a bit of a delay at Joe Louis Arena while the maintenance crew cleans up the ice. It's littered with hats. That's right, Justin Abdelkader completes the hat trick by burying a wrist shot behind new goalie James Riemer. Free fries Saturday. The fans salute Abdelkader by chanting \"Abby! Abby! Abby!\" Kyle Quincey and Henrik Zetterberg with assists. That's three for the captain. Dylan Larkin is trending in Detroit on Twitter — Larry Lage (@LarryLage) October 10, 2015 \nRed Wings 3, Maple Leafs 0 (19:40): The arena is really rocking now. Dylan Larkin scores his first NHL goal on a wrist shot from the left faceoff circle and is left sporting a smile that stretches from here to Toledo. HUGE ovation from the crowd. First shot of the period, too. Give the assists to Zetterberg and Green. \nRed Wings 2, Maple Leafs 0 (19:59): Both teams had four scoring chances in the first period. The Red Wings had 12 hits to Toronto's four but the Maple Leafs had the edge in blocks (3-2) and faceoff wins (15-9). \nFIRST PERIOD \nRed Wings 2, Maple Leafs 0 (0:00): Red Wings get outshot 9-8 in the first period. \nRed Wings 2, Maple Leafs 0 (0:16.1): Off-setting minors for roughing to Jonathan Ericsson and Toronto's Dion Phaneuf after the latter took some liberties with Tomas Tatar. They'll play some 4-on-4.
