The New York Knicks franchise player reported no problems in his return to on court action, and has been cleared to go full contact for the remainder of camp.\n\"It went good, got through a full practice,\" Anthony said. \"Everything felt good. Just got excited about getting through the drills, being able to get back on the court again.\nIt was Anthony's first on court activity with the Knicks in seven months. He had surgery to repair a patella injury in his left knee in late February. He has no medical restriction on his knee for training camp, and is under no minutes restriction for the upcoming season.\n\"It's been a long time, just sitting back and watching it, putting a lot of work into my body, rehab and training and treatment since February. To be back on the court now, where I can just focus on basketball it's a pretty good feeling.\"\nThe 31 year-old Anthony spent time working out one-on-one with rookie Kristaps Porzingis over the summer and scrimmaging with his teammates at the Knicks practice facility.\n\"I feel like I'm ready to go. I feel like I felt before I even had the injury,\" he said. \"Physically I feel great, mentally I feel great. I'm just ready to get out there and get this thing going. I've been waiting for this since February.\nCoach Derek Fisher said there are no plans to restrict Anthony during training camp, but still may opt to give him a little break just to keep him fresh.\n\"I expect him to do everything unless we tell him not to,\" Fisher said. \"He's generally excited to be back on the court. Any player that's suffered a major injury, had surgery, been away from basketball for six months, they're excited to touch the ball again and be back. I don't expect that he'll want to hold himself out but we'll try our best to kind of manage it because we have a long way to go.\"\n.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:19:43.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
