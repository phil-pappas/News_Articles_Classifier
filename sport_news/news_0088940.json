So chances are good you’ll get invited to a pub or perhaps even a playoff game to cheer on the Jays as they step up to the plate for a run at the World Series championship.\nIf don’t know a blueberry from a baseball (and didn’t understand even one cliché in the paragraph above) fear not. Here are 10 tips to help a baseball neophyte fake fandom and fit in to the crowd.\n1. Gear\nGet a jersey. But if $280 is too pricey for you, a fairweather fan, make a smaller investment in a piece of classic gear — baseball cap, T-shirt or coffee mug — all worthy of the longtime fan. A key-chain is also a quick and affordable ploy: casually throw your keys on the table with the logo showing. Your pals will think you’ve been baseballing for years.\n2. Mascot\nThe big blue bird on the field is the team mascot and he has a name — Ace. According to the Jays’ website, his father invented bird stickers commonly seen on windows and his mom works as a goose down supplier. Toss out this knowledge at your next dinner party.\n3. Price\nDavid Price is the Jays’ recently acquired, game-changing ace pitcher. His trade from the Detroit Tigers cost the Jays lefty Daniel Norris — famously known for occasionally living out of a van — Matt Boyd and Jairo Labourt. Know this about David Price: His dog’s name is Astro.\n4. Nicknames\n“Tulo” is the nickname for shortstop Troy Tulowitzki (pronounced too-low). “Gibby” is manager John Gibbons’ nickname. “Joey Bats” is the nickname for right fielder Jose Bautista — and the name of his Twitter handle.\n5. Stretch it out\nLearn the moves that accompany the “OK Blue Jays” song. J Force, the Jays’ in-stadium promotions team, leads the moves during the seventh-inning stretch at home games. Hum along if you’re lacking in the coordination department.\n6. The standout\nThird baseman Josh Donaldson is an MVP candidate. Some are calling him the best player in baseball this year. Commit this to memory.\n7. Lingo\nSure, “Rogers Centre” is accurate, but if you want to fit in with the cool kids, call it “The Dome” or “SkyDome.” That’s what long-standing Jays fans say.\n8. Polish\nGet your claws out — your trendy, fancy, blue claws that is incase a fly ball comes your way. Naomi Misu, a nail artist at Tips Nail Bar on Danforth Ave., has three brand suggestions for the best “Blue Jays blue” nail colour — OPI, CND Vinylux and Revlon.\n9. Drought\nIt’s been 22 years since the Jays last made the post-season — giving the team the longest such drought in professional sports. Remember where you were that year and what you were doing, then toss out that info like it’s ingrained in your memory: “The last time the Jays made the post-season, I was flipping burgers at McDonalds!”\n10. AA\nAlex Anthopoulos is the Blue Jays’ general manager who pulled off a series of trades at the deadline to turn the Jays into a bona fide World Series contender. He’s five years in. Toronto Star sports columnist Bruce Arthur has called him “ Toronto’s boy wonder .” Know this.\nWith files from Brendan Kennedy and Michele Henry\nMore on thestar.com\nFive ways to see Toronto’s fall foliage: Micallef\nHermes Apple Watch a happy marriage of technology, timeless style", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:14:13.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
