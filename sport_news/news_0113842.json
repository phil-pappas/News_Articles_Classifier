It may be closer than you know USA Today Sports 18 hrs ago by Gabe Lacques, USA TODAY Sports As Jason Hammel came off the Wrigley Field mound after digging the Chicago Cubs a five-run, second-inning hole Wednesday night, he was booed heartily.\nAdChoices Sounds of discontent echoed through the Friendly Confines again five innings later, when, for the second consecutive game, Kyle Schwarber turned left field into a performance art space while turning a pair of outs into New York Mets hits.\nBut the Wrigleyville natives who sulked through a season-ending Game 4 loss in the National League Championship Series missed the point when directing their ire toward the players who failed and flailed the most in the sweep at the hands of the Mets.\nHammel, you see, is far from an ideal choice to start a playoff game, let alone an elimination game.\nSchwarber, of course, has no business dragging his 235 pounds around the outfield.\nThat they were put in such ill-fitting positions tells us plenty about the Cubs’ expectations for 2015: They had no plans to make it this far.\nAnd it also speaks volumes about the Cubs’ future. They fell just one tier shy of the World Series with a catcher in left field, a rotation that went two-deep in trustworthy veterans and a bullpen giving high-leverage innings to arms other teams discarded during the course of the season.\nAll that talk you hear of a budding Cubs dynasty? It’s far from idle chatter, and these 2015 playoffs only reinforced that notion. Here’s several reasons why:\n***\nThe young bats . We’ll start with the obvious. Schwarber and Kris Bryant possess raw power and savant-like hitting skills, rare commodities in this era. Bryant will be the NL Rookie of the Year after his 26-homer, .858 OPS campaign; Schwarber banged 16 home runs and produced an .842 OPS in 273 plate appearances and the duo combined for seven postseason home runs.\nIt’s hardly a stretch to project the duo combining for 50 home runs next year, when Bryant starts at third base from Opening Day on and Schwarber most likely gets the majority of starts at catcher. And how much will those 50 home runs cost the Cubs? A little more than a million bucks.\nLet’s not forget that All-Star first baseman Anthony Rizzo – a likely top 5 MVP finisher – won’t even crack the eight-figure salary mark until 2019, when he’s due to make $11 million. The club holds reasonable options on him through 2021.\nThat’s a massive savings for a team that’s prepared to start acting like the big-market behemoth it is. Still, budgets are budgets, and to have young, cheap power under club control for the next six seasons – rather than roll the dice on a huge but iffy free agent prop like Chris Davis – is invaluable.\nIn the short term, that money saved can instead be thrown toward a deep but not cost-prohibitive class of free agent starting pitchers – to ensure it’s someone like Jordan Zimmermann, and not Jason Hammel, starting next year’s elimination game.\n***\nThe war chest . Ah, yes, speaking of money, it will flow freer than Old Style from a Wrigley tap. The renovated Wrigley Field and its enhanced revenue streams debuted this season, but the transformation of the area – and the massive potential for non-shared revenue going directly into Chairman Tom Ricketts’ coffers – remains. Additionally, the Cubs have not yet cashed in on the billion-dollar potential of a new cable TV contract. While there’s some concern the club played that game too slow – talk of a cable TV bubble only grows as consumers unplug – it also can’t hurt that the Cubs are practically broadcast free agents at a time the club is potent, charismatic and poised to win for years.\nIn other words, they’ll soon have the assurance of TV dollars that have inspired the Dodgers to spend wildly, with clubs like the Phillies poised to follow suit.\n***\nThe brain trust . Of course, all that cash doesn’t matter if the front office is manned by impetuous Luddites who know not how to build a team. Sure, president of baseball operations Theo Epstein has probably received too much rock-star treatment in the media, but he and his aide-de-camps – GM Jed Hoyer and player development VP Jason McLeod – are a formidable group. Unlike quick rebuilds in places like Washington, Tampa Bay and Houston, the Cubs have not benefited from a slam dunk, franchise player awaiting them atop the draft. Sure, Bryant went second overall, but he was hardly the consensus top talent in the 2013 draft. Schwarber was taken fourth overall a year later; just two weeks before that draft, Baseball America projected Schwarber would go 24th overall.\nAnd in perhaps the group’s greatest coup, they managed to pry shortstop Addison Russell from the Oakland Athletics for Jeff Samardzija in 2013. Just like that: Another potential All-Star manning a crucial position and getting paid – for now – relative peanuts to do so.\nAs the Cubs get better, they won’t enjoy such favorable draft positions. This is where a glance at the Epstein Administration’s Boston record is instructive. Jacoby Ellsbury and Clay Buchholz (23rd and 42nd overall in 2005), Dustin Pedroia (24th in 2004) and Anthony Rizzo (sixth round in 2007) are but a few of the All-Star caliber players plucked out of later draft slots that helped keep the Red Sox machine rolling. So long as Hoyer and McLeod don’t jump ship for promotions elsewhere, this group’s draft and development chops are exemplary.\n***\nThe manager . Speaking of media love affairs, Joe Maddon already had the nation drinking out of his shot glass before he even flew off to spring training. Yet the skipper as admired for his erudite manner as his dugout skills showed why the Cubs bloodlessly shoved Rick Renteria out the door when Maddon became available exactly a year ago. He flawlessly integrated young players into the mix, turned potential distractions – like Bryant’s delayed major league debut – into rallying points of sorts and managed to win 97 games in perhaps the most top-heavy division in the wild card era.\nWhen the Curse is broken, the man in the dugout may have very little to do with it. That said, Maddon’s abundant chill and ability to foster a positive vibe – let’s call it a culture of fearlessness – leave no doubt he’s more than qualified to stand up to a legacy of futility.\nEven if the fans are far too willing to clutch onto decades of misery.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfutnL.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmjm6W.img&quot;}}", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;baseball_mlb&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;deGrom", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Mets", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Rough", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmjc4y.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Cubs&#39;", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmkh0j.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Jacob"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:22:11.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
