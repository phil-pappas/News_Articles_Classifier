The club announced Wednesday he will be replaced by John Tortorella. \nThe Blue Jackets were the first team to start 0-7 since the Chicago Blackhawks in the 1997-1998 season. \nTortorella, who signed a three-year contract through the 2017-18 season, will make his Blue Jackets debut on Thursday when Columbus visits the Minnesota Wild. \nTortorella hasn’t coached in the NHL since the 2013-14 season with Vancouver, where he went 34-31 and missed the playoffs. The 57-year-old Boston-native also served as coach of the New York Rangers (1999-2000 & 2008-2013), Tampa Bay Lightning (2000-2008). \nTortorella has a combined 446-375 record since 1999. John Tortorella Hired As Columbus Blue Jackets Coach Press Conference \n“After much deliberation and discussion, we have made the very difficult decision late last night to remove Todd Richards as our head coach and we’ve reached an agreement with John Tortorella to join the Columbus Blue Jackets in that capacity,” said General Manager Jarmo Kekalainen. “None of us saw our season unfolding the way it has and every one of us from management to coaches to players bears responsibility. There is still a lot of hockey to be played and we believe this change was necessary to give our team the best chance to accomplish the goals we’ve set for this season.” \nTodd Richards was named head coach of the Blue Jackets in May 2012 after serving as the club’s interim head coach from Jan. 9, 2012 through the end of the 2011-12 season. The Blue Jackets went 42-35-5 last season and failed to qualify for the playoffs. During his stint in Columbus, the 49-year-old was 127-112-21 over four seasons. \n“On behalf of our organization, I want to thank Todd for his many contributions both on and off the ice to the Columbus Blue Jackets over the past four-plus years,” said club President of Hockey Operations John Davidson. “He took over under very difficult circumstances and did a terrific job guiding our team to heights it had not before reached. I have great respect for Todd as a coach and a person and wish nothing but the best for him, his wife, Maryann, and their wonderful family.” ©2015 by 10TV.com. All rights reserved.
