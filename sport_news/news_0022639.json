Up for sale were big ticket items like seats from the old Joe Becker Stadium, basketball hoops, police cars, and the city's first trolley that sold for $8,500. The money raised at auction will be recycled back into the accounts where the items were purchased and helps to offset the cost of buying new equipment in the future.\nJoplin Finance Director Leslie Haase says \"Obviously we have a lot of equipment we have to buy each and every year, from mowers to police cars to fire trucks, so a lot of equipment to buy. As we recycle it out that money goes back towards buying the new equipment.\"\nHaase says close to $67,000 dollars was brought in last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T09:36:23.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
