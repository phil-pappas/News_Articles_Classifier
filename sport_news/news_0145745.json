Texas dropped its second game in-a-row and third game this season.\nHere are five thoughts after Texas' game against Oklahoma State\n1. Mistakes, turnovers play big role in loss\nDickson's mishandled a snap cost the Longhorns as Oklahoma State capitalized withthe game-winning field goal\nTurnovers also played a key role.\nRedshirt freshman quarterback Jerrod Heard threw an interception when senior wide receiver Marcus Johnson bobbled a pass and it fell into the arms of a Cowboy defender.\nThe Longhorns had two defensive touchdowns against Oklahoma State. Texas' defense came up big in the second quarter when Oklahoma State quarterback Mason Rudolph lost the ball and junior defensive tackle Hassan Ridgeway scooped the ball and scored on 34-yard fumble return.\nRudolph threw an interception in the third quarter which freshman cornerback Davante Davis returned 41-yards for a touchdown. Junior safety Dylan Haines intercepted Rudolph in the fourth quarter.\n2. Penalties continue to plague Longhorns\nTexas' trend of poorly timed penalties continued against the Cowboys.\nIn the fourth quarter, Texas' defense committed a holding penalty followed by an unsportsman-like penalty which allowed Oklahoma State to get into the redzone. The Cowboys converted a 41-yard field goal to tie the game.\nIn the third quarter, the Longhorns ran a double-pass play where senior wide receiver Marcus Johnson completed what would've been a 53-yard touchdown pass to freshman John Burt but it was ruled a double-forward pass.\nIn the second quarter, freshman cornerback Kris Boyd intercepted an errant pass from Rudolph and returned it into Oklahoma State territory but it was called back for roughing the passer on sophomore defense tackle Poona Ford.\nThe Longhorns' offensive line also committed costly holding penalties. Sophomore running D'Onta Foreman scored a touchdown deep in Oklahoma State territory but it was negated on a hold by freshman Patrick Vahe.\nTexas had 16 penalties for 128 yards against Oklahoma State.\n3. Defense shows improvement\nIt appeared as if the Longhorns were in for another long day defensively when the Cowboys scored 14 points to begin the game.\nBut the Longhorns' defense was able to regroup. Ridgeway's fumble return touchdown was key for the Texas.\nDespite losing, the Longhorns had one of its best games this season. Although they gave up a few big plays throughout. Texas only gave up 395 yards against the Cowboys.\n4. Texas offense continues to grow\nThe Longhorns didn't have a historic game against Oklahoma State but they continued to show growth.\nIn his third game as Texas' play-caller, Jay Norvell has shown he's able to call plays that get the ball into the playmakers hands.\nSix different receivers caught the ball against the Cowboys. Johnson led the team with 50 yards.\nThe running game also saw an increase in production with 171 yards rushing led by senior running back Johnathan Gray's 55 yards on 11 carries\n5. Texas uses Swoopes in 'belldozer' package\nThe Longhorns used junior quarterback Tyrone Swoopes in a jumbo short-yardage formation. Swoopes, who lost the starting role to Heard, was efficient when used.\nTexas put him in three times for 35 yards. He was able to convert a fourth and two at the Oklahoma State seven yard line. Swoopes found the endzone on the play to give the Longhorns a 20-17 lead in the second quarter.\nTexas' decision to play Swoopes in short yardage changed the pace of the game.\nNo. 24 Oklahoma State 30, at Texas 27\nFull coverage Five thoughts: Late-game mistake hurts Texas in 30-27 loss to Oklahoma State\nTexas quotable: 'We just can't finish right now'\nNot again!
