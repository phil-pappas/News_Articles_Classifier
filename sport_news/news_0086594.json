Hunters urged to report pheasants with leg bands HARRISBURG — Pheasant hunting in Pennsylvania kicks off Saturday with the weeklong season for junior hunters, followed by the statewide opening day for pheasants Oct. 24. With the season nearly here, hunters are advised that some of the pheasants they find in the field might have leg bands. And by reporting those birds, hunters can provide important information as part of a study into pheasant harvest rates. This fall, the Pennsylvania Game Commission is conducting a study to assess harvest rates of ring-necked pheasants raised on game farms, then released to provide hunting opportunities in Pennsylvania. Game Commission wildlife biometrician Josh Johnson said about 5,500 pheasants are being banded and, over the course of the season, will be released on public lands along with more than 200,000 non-banded pheasants. Each leg band is stamped with a toll-free number hunters can call to provide the date and location of harvest. Johnson said hunter participation is crucial to the success of the study, and he urged all hunters who bag banded pheasants to report their harvests. Further, any banded pheasants found dead from other causes, such as being hit by a vehicle, also should be reported, as this information is very important to us as well, Johnson said. A similar study on pheasant harvest rates was conducted in the fall of 1998. That study found about 50 percent of pheasants stocked by the Game Commission were harvested. Since then, however, many changes to pheasant-stocking strategies have been implemented. These changes aim for higher harvest rates, but harvest rates have not been evaluated since the changes took place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:57:22.028+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
