West in recent years, but the teams enter this matchup tied for last place. While the 49ers were not expected to be very good this season, the same cannot be said for the Seahawks, who were expected to contend once again for a spot in the Super Bowl .\nAnd just when it looked as though the Seahawks might be on the verge of getting their swagger back on Sunday, the team’s vaunted Legion of Boom defense blew a fourth-quarter lead at home to the Carolina Panthers. With the Seahawks up late, 23-14 — after holding a 20-7 lead — Cam Newton led two 80-yard drives for touchdowns to keep the Panthers undefeated and send the Seahawks on a desperate search for answers.\n“I know you guys don’t want to hear it, but we have six games we should have won, and we know that,” Coach Pete Carroll told reporters after the game. “It’s not what happened, it’s how we’re going to handle it. We’ll find out.”\n(Carroll this week also dismissed rumors that he might leave Seattle to return to coach U.S.C. “That’s not happening,” he said.)\nColin Kaepernick has rebounded from a disastrous start and is beginning to resemble the quarterback who took the team to the Super Bowl after the 2012 season. He has taken many more snaps under center in the past two weeks than he did in the first four weeks, which saw him sitting back in the shotgun most of the time. Observers believe this is allowing him to get the ball out quicker, while also giving him better looks at defenses.\nThat said, the Seahawks’ defense has tormented Kaepernick. In six starts against Seattle, Kaepernick has thrown nine interceptions and lost two fumbles, while throwing only three touchdown passes and accumulating a 54.1 passer rating. With a loss, the Seahawks’ record in the division would be 0-2, making any shot at a playoff berth increasingly improbable.\nPick: Seahawks\nBRETT MICHAEL DYKES\nCorrection: October 22, 2015\nBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the season in which Colin Kaepernick led the San Francisco 49ers to the Super Bowl.
