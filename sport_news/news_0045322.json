There is no doubt at this point, because of whats been admitted so far, the NCAA will have no choice but to find probation and I would guess at some point very soon. You're going to hear that Louisville's going to sit out an NCAA Tournament. \nBut the next question is the future of Rick Pitino. He did an interview today (Thursday) with Terry Meiners in Louisville that was really bizarre and ended up with him rambling about a lot of things and taking a subtle shot at the school president. \nThings are going to get weirder in Louisville and all we can say here in Lexington is thank goodness it's not happening to Kentucky. For once 'Little Brother' is not in an envious position.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T07:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:17:55.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
