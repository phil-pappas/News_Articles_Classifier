(Photo: Otto Greule Jr., Getty Images) \nJosh Katzenstein, John Niyo and Bob Wojnowski of The Detroit News offer their predictions for Monday night's Lions at Seahawks game. \nJosh Katzenstein: The Lions have much more potential than they've shown so far, but besides wide receiver, the Seahawks are better at just about every position. They could keep it close, but at 1-2, Seattle won't take it easy on the 0-3 Lions. Seattle 27-10\nJohn Niyo: This is another opponent with serious problems up front offensively. But the Lions seem to have everybody trumped there, and against the Legion of Boom — on a Monday night, no less — that's still a recipe for a loss, if not a disaster. Seattle 23-20\nBob Wojnowski: The good news for the Lions is, Marshawn Lynch is out and the Seahawks' offense has been slow and stodgy. The bad news is, the Seahawks' defense still enjoys dismantling opponents. Matthew Stafford and Calvin Johnson somehow will have to pop a big play or two, because slugging it out with Seattle doesn't work. The Seahawks are 1-2 and still hungry.
