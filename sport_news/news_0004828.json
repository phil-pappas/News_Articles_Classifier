By Sunday, the Southeastern Conference will have at least one less undefeated team and maybe and the state of Michigan could have a new best team â€” same as the old best team.\nWeek seven of the college football season has already been monumental. Here's what else to watch:\nSEC SHOWDOWNS\nThe first game of life without quarterback Will Grier for No. 8 Florida (6-0, 4-0) comes against No. 6 LSU (5-0, 3-0) in Death Valley at night. Not ideal, but four times during Les Miles' tenure as the Tigers coach Florida and LSU have met with both ranked in the top 10. The Gators have won three. The lone victory for LSU came in 2007 at Tigers Stadium.\nTreon Harris, who has made seven career starts, takes over for Grier at quarterback for Florida. Brandon Harris (no relation) is the quarterback for LSU, but more importantly the Tigers have Heisman Trophy contender Leonard Fournette, who leads the nation in rushing but has not faced a defense yet as good of Florida's.\nThe other big SEC game is in College Station, where No. 8 Alabama (5-1, 2-1) faces No. 9 Texas A&M (5-0, 2-0). Matchup to watch: Aggies defensive end Myles Garrett against Alabama offensive tackle Cam Robinson. A couple of sophomores and future first-round NFL draft picks.\nBATTLE OF MICHIGAN\nMichigan State has not just owned its rivalry with Michigan lately, winning six of seven. Spartans coach Mark Dantonio has built his program on a foundation of victories against the Wolverines.\nSix games into his tenure Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh has a chance to shift the power back to Ann Arbor.\nThe seventh-ranked Spartans (6-0, 2-0 Big Ten) visit the Big House, coming off two close wins against sub-.500 teams and with banged up offensive lines and secondaries. No. 12 Michigan (5-1, 2-0) storms into the game having not allowed a point in its last three games.\nWILL THE TROJANS FIGHT ON?\nThe first game for Southern California (3-2) since coach Steve Sarkisian was fired comes against rival Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. Again, not ideal. The No. 14 Fighting Irish (5-1) have playoff hopes and no time to feel sorry for their troubled rivals.\nHard to guess what to expect from USC and interim coach Clay Helton. Maybe having the Sarkisian situation resolved brings the team together and unburdens the players. USC still has loads of talent, like receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, defensive back Adoree Jackson, who also plays offense and returns kicks, and defensive back Su'a Craven. Beating Notre Dame won't make everything better at USC, but it is a step in the right direction.\nHUSKIES DROUGHT\nWashington has lost 11 straight games to Oregon and rarely have the Huskies even put up a fight.\nWith the Ducks (3-3, 1-2 Pac-12) down and the Huskies (3-2, 1-1) coming off a victory at USC, this might be the perfect opportunity for coach Chris Petersen's team to reassert itself on the North Division.\nOregon is hoping to get quarterback Vernon Adams back in the lineup.\nUNRANKED AND UNDEFEATED\nMemphis (5-0) gets a chance to score the biggest victory of the season for a non-Power Five team against a Power Five team when the Tigers host No. 13 Mississippi (5-1).\nThe Rebels have won six straight against their regional rivals and they have one of the toughest defenses in the nation, led by defensive tackle Robert Nkemdiche. Memphis, though, has the best quarterback on the field in Paxton Lynch.\n___\nFollow Ralph D.
