In the final he faces Uzbekistan's Bektemir Melikuziev, who narrowly defeated Ireland's Michael O'Reilly in a split points decision. \n\nMelikuziev, the Asian middleweight champion, narrowly took the fight two rounds to one. \n\nSavon jabbed and blasted his way to victory against Abdulkadir Abdullayev of Azerbaijan and will take on Russia's powerful southpaw Evgeny Tischenko in the final, which promises to be one of the best fights of the 10-day tournament. \n\nAnother notable win among the ten semi-finals on Sunday came for Ireland's Michael Conlan. \n\nThe busy bantamweight (56kg) skillfully saw off Dmitry Asanau of Belarus with a unanimous points decision. \n\nBelfast's Conlan said he was confident of victory in the final and was yet to \"get out of third gear\" in the tournament. \n\n\"I'm really looking forward to the final now,\" he said afterwards. \"I kept my cool and held my patience, I didn't panic.\" \n\nHe added that the final would \"either be a boxing match or a war\". \n\nConlan will face Uzbekistan's Murodjon Akhmadaliev in the final, who beat India's last contestant, Shiva Thapa on points. \n\nThe Indian disputed the decision saying he thought he was \"the clear winner\". \n\n\"It is always nice when you hear people saying that you should have won, but the reality is that I didn't.\" \n\nAnother powerful performance came from Uzbekistan's Fazliddin Gaibnazarov who beat the number two seed Wuttichai Masuk at light-welterweight (64kg). \n\nFilipino Rogen Ladon, who had defeated world number two Joselito Velazquez of Mexico earlier in the tournament, found the semi-finals to be one fight too far, losing to Russia's Vasili Egorov, in the first bout of the night in the light-flyweight division.
