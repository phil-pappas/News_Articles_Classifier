He caught TD passes of 75 and 37 yards for Texas Tech (4-2, 1-2). It was Grant's third 100-plus-yard game this season. \nDeAndre Washington had a receiving and a rushing TD, while Justin Stockton scored on a 54-yard rush. \nThe Red Raiders intercepted Cyclones quarterback Sam Richardson three times — two by J.J. Gaines — and Texas Tech scored touchdowns off two of them. \nMahomes was sacked for only the second time this season when he was called for intentional grounding. \nRedshirt freshman Mike Warren had his third straight game of more than 100 yards for the Cyclones (2-3, 1-1), finishing with a career-high 245 yards on 23 carries. \nIowa State quarterback Sam Richardson completed 10 of 21 for 139 yards and three interceptions. He had three coming into the game. \nJoshua Thomas scored two rushing touchdowns for the Cyclones, each from a yard out. \nTexas Tech's 776 total yards was a school record. \nRed Raiders pass offense was the best in the country coming into the game but their receiving corps has thinned due to injuries. Ian Sadler and Devin Lauderdale, who have combined for five TDs and 527 yards, did not play. \nThat gave true freshman Jonathan Giles opportunities he might not have had. He caught a 3-yard touchdown from Mahomes and a 21-yarder from backup Davis Webb who took over for Mahomes in the fourth quarter. Giles' five catches and 59 yards receiving were career-highs. \nMahomes completed 33 of 46 passes with no interceptions. \nThe Red Raiders hadn't won a game since finishing up their nonconference schedule with a win at Arkansas in September. They then dropped games to then-No. 3 TCU — on a deflected reception in the end zone with 23 seconds remaining — before falling to then-No. 5 Baylor last week. \nTexas Tech scored on its first three possessions and led the whole way. The Red Raiders second touchdown came on the first play of a drive when Mahomes found Grant at the Texas Tech's own 40. Grant cut back to the middle of the field and used at least two blockers to get into the end zone. \nIn the second quarter, Mahomes threw a screen pass on the far sideline to Washington, who cut back to the middle of the field and outran defenders to score. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:40:04.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
