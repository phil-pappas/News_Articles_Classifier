The student, Kyle Hornback, is the 2015 winner of the Miss Cardinal Country pageant, whatever that is. \nHornback’s lawyer, Nader George Shunnarah, asks that it be a class action lawsuit on behalf of all UofL students. The suit hopes to place all profits from Breaking Cardinal Rules with a receiver in the Jefferson Circuit Court clerk’s office. \nHere’s a picture of Shunnarah standing in front of books, taken from his website . \nYou can find more pictures of Kyle Hornback in her Miss COED 2016 photo gallery for COED Magazine. \nI’m no lawyer, but this doesn’t seem like the best of ideas. In fact, it’s quite possibly the second dumbest thing I’ve read all day, behind Peyton Siva Sr.’s Facebook post. \nEveryone at UofL should stay quiet right now. Article written by Drew Franklin I can recite every line from Forrest Gump, blindfolded.

CATandMONKEY October 22, 2015 at 3:42 pm | Permalink \nMaybe all of us should sue our respective institutions when we have a subpar athletic teams because it “devalues” the education at said institution. Ridiculous.….and attorneys wonder why they get a bad rap… Dusten October 22, 2015 at 3:34   \nMaybe she should be suing Rick? Or McGee?

The fact that you still owe on your house significantly decreases the value of the house to you. \nThis is one of the dumbest things I have read today. What on earth is she thinking? Mc October 22, 2015 at 3:37   \nDid she sue Pitino for his scandal, or UL for hiring Pitrino? J-Dub421 October 22, 2015 at 3:38   \nThis is the very definition of a frivolous lawsuit.

Jackie Childs October 22, 2015 at 3:42   \nClass action with one plaintiff? Interesting. The only people that actually make money on class actions are the lawyers. Typically a class of 50,000 people sues a credit card company. The lawyer makes millions each plaintiff gets a check for $5.95. Maybe they can settle out of court. I am sure Katina could find employment for this coed that will make her more money that her degree from a Hooker U. CATandMONKEY October 22, 2015 at 3:46 pm | Permalink \nBased on that pic, it appears she might be able to command more than the hookers in question. Maybe. ajh October 22, 2015 at 4:03 pm | Permalink \nThere is usually a lead plaintiff (class member) in most class action suits. ClutchCargo October 22, 2015 at 3:42   \nLet’s cut her some slack. Maybe Katina Powell indirectly gave her herpes and now she just wants revenge. greg yopp October 22, 2015 at 3:48   \nI would think McGee and everyone else involved would be necessary parties before any suit could proceed. ukdavid68 October 22, 2015 at 3:50   \nThis is so stupid Nader George Shunnarah should be disbarred thatDguy October 22, 2015 at 3:50   \nI’m not one that has hopped on the U of L-bashing bandwagon, as the whole, alleged prostitution affair is merely that at this moment; an allegation. However, even the allegation and the bits and pieces of “evidence” have already damaged the image of major college basketball and, by affiliation, UK’s as well. No matter how this plays out, U of L’s athletic department will feel the repercussions for years. That all makes this college basketball fan very sad. On another sad note, this bottom-feeding attorney and his naive client have added another ring to the circus. This event has now officially become a 3-ring, Big Top Circus media feast and Mr. Shunnarah, Esq. is trying to cash in. Sad, but funny…I can’t look away. RockyMountainWildcat October 22, 2015 at 4:10 pm | Permalink \nHow does this damage the reputation of anyone but Louisville and those involved? Everyone in the know is aware that this kind of thing doesn’t go on anywhere else. Jay Bilas says he’s never heard of anything like this in the last twenty years. But yeah, completely agreed that this lawsuit is a joke. With any luck, and a judge who knows what the hell he’s doing, this will get tossed out and the lawyer will have to just live with draining money only from his stupid client, not taxpayers in Jefferson County as well. Jay Hornback October 22, 2015 at 3:52   \nI hope she’s not related to me. CATandMONKEY October 22, 2015 at 3:55   \nI may counter-sue Ms Hornback for devaluing my undergrad degree from UofL because of her ignorant lawsuit. Thank God she is in poly-sci and not in any math or chemistry program. john wall October 22, 2015 at 3:58   \nShe should sue louisville for how bad that L sign (by affiliation) makes her look now hahaha Laker Cat 18 October 22, 2015 at 4:02   \nThis lawsuit should be aborted immediately. See what I did there? Hammer Time October 22, 2015 at 4:09   \nPowell’s current lawyer is a an indiana lawyer and is not licensed to practice in kentucky. She is going to have to hire a second attorney it appears. pithuahua October 22, 2015 at 4:12   \nShe is pretty but that’s stupid….so that makes her pretty stupid! A degree from UL is not worth the recycled toilet paper its scribbled on. Cash October 22, 2015 at 4:15   \nThis is GREAT! You guys are missing the big picture… By suing, they have to admit this all happened. She can’t be profiting off a criminal activity if NOTHING happened. By suing they have to say “yeah there was a prostitute on campus selling her body and now she shouldn’t benefit off telling the story.” The legal theory is actually quite sound, and she could win, but there will be so much dirt turned about this basketball program that its going to make the book look like nothing! The Professor October 22, 2015 at 4:31 pm | Permalink \nYour argument is totally illogical. She is suing because the “allegations” have harmed the reputation of the school and thus her degree is less valuable. As far as the lawsuit goes, it is irrelevant whether the allegations are true or not, The damage is done by the allegations. That said, the whole case seems frivilous in nature. jman3715 October 22, 2015 at 4:35 pm | Permalink \nActually I agree with Cash. She would need to prove the allegations are false in order to collect. In doing so, she would need to have some of those mentioned in the book swear under oath that these things did not occur. I don’t think anyone at UofL wants any of the parties involved on the stand in a legal proceeding. webster dictionary October 22, 2015 at 4:22   \nI think she is right- to me, the UL diploma has been devalued. These former UL basketball alumni and their family’s entries on facebook have set back the English language to the days of the bubonic plague. They abused sentences and basic general grammar like Ike Turner abused Tina Turner. This book made these UL people come out and write 1,000 words with just one period. Reading their comments hurt my brain and I can not get that time back in my life. If this is how UL teaches by not giving their students a basic understanding on basic sentence structure, it would DEVALUE an UL diploma Dude October 22, 2015 at 4:59 pm | Permalink \nWouldn’t it be “ebonic” plague? KevinM October 22, 2015 at 4:41   \nThat’s so cute sweetie! I think your gripe is with the people who run your university to allow these types of things to take place. \nMaybe Rick’s nephew can introduce you to the man himself so he can determine how much you’re worth! LivesUnderRocks October 22, 2015 at 4:45   \nI’m sorry, but when did a scandal involving a university’s athletic department devalue the academic arena of said university? My alma mater’s athletic successes/failures neither added nor deducted from my diploma’s value. Can “Louisville Men and Women” be any dumber? Raul Hidalgo October 22, 2015 at 4:57 pm | Permalink \nUNC? Massive fraud by the athletic department which revealed the university had an entire academic department that was a sham to keep athletes eligible. This type of lawsuit would be much more appropriate in North Carolina. Blue Mist October 22, 2015 at 4:47   \nWhat the crap is Cardinal Country? I thought it was Cardinal County Jefferson County is the only place you will find anyone who admits being a cardinal today. UKBlue October 22, 2015 at 4:48   \nWow this is stupid! Under the Discovery part of the lawsuit this will allow all of the information that no one at UL including former players, boosters, their foundation is going to want out in the public. This girl just really screwed UL & everyone involved. BluKudzu October 22, 2015 at 4:51   \nShe is suing the wrong person. She needs to sue the university of Louisville, the athletic department, tom jurich , rick pitino and the members of his staff and the players. It is their actions that have marginalized the value of her education at u of l. Not the fault of the services they chose to use. In fact, if I am a parent paying tuition right now, I sure as hell would start a class action suit. GatorCat October 22, 2015 at 5:02   \nJust when you think this soap opera can’t get any better, another gift arrives. Her frivolous suit will result in more media coverage and, since the book was co-authored by a contractor of IBJ, likely pull some very deep pockets in Indiana into the fray. Just watching the lawyers in this trainwreck (talk about whores, indeed!) will be worth the price of admission. Ed in Indiana October 22, 2015 at 5:04   \nThe lawsuit will be dismissed immediately. The Exhibits to the motion to dismiss will be: 1. Picture of Pitrino in his neckbrace; 2. Collection of Newspapers covering Sypher/Pitino case; 3. Pictures from Clint Hurtt NCAA investigation; 4. Pictures of students making the ridiculous “L” symbol; 5. Line beards October 22, 2015 at 5:09   \nI’m dying laughing over here…gifts keep on giving. Sue them, sue them now! harry October 22, 2015 at 5:10   \nsue everyone, more stuff will surface harry October 22, 2015 at 5:15   \nGood point about the devaluation of degree, but that actually started with your decision to attend Louisville.
