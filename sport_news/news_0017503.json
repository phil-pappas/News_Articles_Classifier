They also requested specific tweets to be removed. \nThe 33 pages of notices were filed by NetResult, an Internet copyright monitoring company, acting on behalf of the NFL and Ultimate Fighting Championship. Quick Clicks Police: Man survived 6 days in... \n\"The NFL sent routine notices as part of its copyright enforcement program requesting that Twitter disable links to more than a dozen pirated NFL game videos and highlights that violate the NFL's copyrights,\" said NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy. \nWhile @Deadspin was reinstated later in the day, clicking on links of select tweets mentioned in the notices led to an error message: \"Tweet withheld: This Tweet from @Deadspin has been withheld in response to a report from the copyright holder.\" \nThe Twitter account of @SBNationGIF remains suspended. \nTwitter spokesman Nu Wexler declined to comment on the individual accounts.
