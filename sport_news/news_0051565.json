The first one extended the game. The second one caused the pain for Whitefield Academy as it lost in overtime to King’s Ridge 17-16 in a Region 6A (B) game.“My kids gave me everything they had. They left it out on the field,” Wolfpack coach Quinn Gray said. “They work just as hard as we do. They’re going to make some plays and we’re going to make some plays. It’s just unfortunate that they made one more play that we did.”King’s Ridge took a 10-7 lead in the fourth quarter when Kyle Bronovich made a 42-yard field goal. Whitefield answered with a long kickoff return by Cameron Jenkins and a 30-yard pass from Luke Persons to William Schultz. William Hellier’s 26-yard field goal tied the game at 10-10.The Tigers (1-4) coverted three third downs and drove the ball to the Whitefield 6-yard line before milking the clock down to just 3 seconds. But Scott Murphy’s game-winning attempt went wide left.“Celebrating missing that kick,” Gray said, “I might have pulled something in my calf.”King’s Ridge celebrated moments later after Martin took the first snap from overtime, faked the option pitch and scampered into the end zone from 15 yards out.“There were a lot of emotions in those last few minutes,” Tigers coach Jeff Pickren said. “Our quarterback just made about as good a read as you could ever make on that play.“You won’t see that play played any better on a Saturday.”Persons had a similar play, avoiding pressure and running down to the 1-yard line. Edge would walk in on the next play, but the Wolfpack lost their subegion opener when Hellier missed the extra point.“At the end of the day, there’s going to be times when you’re going to make them and when you’re going to miss them,” Gray said. “We missed it (Friday).”Whitefield (1-4, 0-1) was down 7-0 in the first quarter on a 77-yard touchdown pass from Tigers quarterback Reid Martin (16-for-31 for 276 yards) to Jack McHugh. They had a chance for more in the closing moments of the second half after taking over near midfield.Martin completed quick passes despite pressure from Wolfpack senior defensive end T.J. Carter and got King’s Ridge to the 19-yard line on fourth-and-1. With 13 seconds left, the kicking team jogged onto the field.“We were going to kick a field goal, but when they called a timeout we talked about it,” Pickren said. “We thought if we got the first down, we could clock the ball and have a shot at the end zone.”Martin attempted a sneak for the first down, but Whitefield’s defense was up to the challenge. They make the stop and went to locker room down 7-0.“I challenged them at halftime,” Gray said, “because we weren’t playing our kind of football.”That changed in the third quarter as the defense put relentless pressure on Martin. Meanwhile the offense put together their best drive of the night, a 12-play drive culminating with a 10-yard touchdown from Jordan Edge. “Thanks to his offensive line, he was able to step up and put us on his shoulders,” Gray said about the senior tailback who finished with 100 yards and two touchdowns. “He did a great job for us.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:27:15.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
