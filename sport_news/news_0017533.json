The person requested anonymity because no decision had been announced. \nESPN was the first to report Weeden had been informed of the decision. Matt Cassel no quick fix for Cowboys' offensive woes \nGarrett said he would look into the Cowboys offense after the team’s fell to the New England Patriots on Sunday for its third consecutive loss. Weeden threw for a season-low 188 yards and an interception on 26-for-39 passing, but he’s far from the biggest problem on a Cowboys team that has limited weapons in the absence of star receiver Dez Bryant and is struggling on defense, too. \nThe Cowboys sit at 2-3 and are trying to stay afloat without quarterback Tony Romo, who is out until at least Nov. 22 with a broken left collarbone. \nCassel steps in as a starter after being acquired in a late-September trade with the Buffalo Bills. \nThe Cowboys next face the New York Giants in Week 7. \nFollow Tom Pelissero on Twitter @TomPelissero . \nPHOTOS: Best of NFL Week 5 Posted!
