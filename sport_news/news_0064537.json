Bryan Little also had a goal and assist for Winnipeg (4-1-0).\nMikael Backlund scored for Calgary (1-3-0).\nOndrej Pavelec made 19 saves for Winnipeg. Ramo stopped 27 of the 29 shots he faced for the Flames.\nCalgary scored 3:38 into the first period when Sam Bennett's wrap-around bounced off Pavelec to Backlund in front of the net, and Backlund flipped the puck in for his first goal of the season.\nThe Flames outshot the Jets 11-8 in the first, with each club having a power play.\nLittle tied it 1-1 with his third goal of the season at 8:12 of the second when Wheeler shot the puck to the front of the crease and it deflected off Little's leg in behind Ramo.\nThe Jets went on a four-minute power play late in the second after Josh Jooris got a double minor for high-sticking.\nThe penalty carried over into the third and finished with the Jets getting three shots on goal. Center Mark Scheifele had the best chance, but Ramo swept the puck away from behind him to preserve the tie.\nNOTES: The Flames didn't have a shot on goal for more than 20 minutes, ending the slump with 8:54 left in the third. ... Winnipeg was 0 for 4 on the power play as Calgary went scoreless on two chances with the man advantage. ... The game was the first of six straight at home for Winnipeg. St. Louis visits on Sunday. Calgary returns home for three games, starting Saturday against Edmonton.\n1 CONNECT Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
