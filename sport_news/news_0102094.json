More from NBC Montana Phone scam targeting students \nMSU quarterback Dakota Prukop hooked up with Mitchell Herbert for a 79 yard touchdown pass on the second play from scrimmage to make it 7-0 Cats less than a minute into the game. Montana State added another score on their very next drive, as a 9-yard TD run from Justin Paige capped off a 7-play drive for the Bobcats. \nHowever Sacramento State would also find pay-dirt in the opening quarter off a 23-yard TD pass from Kolney Cassel to Nnamdi Agude. The Hornets would add three more points via a Brad Cornish 30 yard field goal with nine minutes left in the first half. \nMSU regained the momentum before halftime on a three yard touchdown run by Prukop. That score was set up two plays earlier by a 47 yard run from Gunnar Brekke on a 4th and two. The Bobcats went into halftime up 21-10. \n\nTwo weeks ago, Montana State rebounded off its road loss to Eastern Washington with a 45-28 win over Cal Poly at home. But the Bobcats struggled as visitors again last week, losing to Northern Arizona 49-41 in Flagstaff. \nMSU returns to Bobcat Stadium to play Sacramento State. The Hornets are on a four-game losing streak, which put them 1-4 on the season and 0-2 in the Big Sky Conference heading into today's game. \nThe Bobcats have won the last nine meetings, including a 59-56 thriller in Sacramento last season. Montana State head coach Rob Ash in 7-0 in his career against the Hornets, but he is not taking them lightly. \n\"Our team is not looking at the record, we're looking at the film,\" Ash said. \"We're seeing athletes on that film.\" \nSacramento State has a collection of playmakers on the offensive side of the ball, and one of the best players in the nation on the defensive side. Linebacker Darnell Sankey is in contention for the STATS FCS Defensive Player of the Year Award. The senior has already racked up four double-digit tackle games this season, and 11 in his last dozen outings. \nThe Bobcat offense has averaged over 45 points per game in the last three games, all against Division I competition. But the defense has yielded 44 per contest during that same span. \nCopyright 2015 by KECI , KCFW , KTVM . All rights reserved.
