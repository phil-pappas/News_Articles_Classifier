(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) \nBALTIMORE (AP) — Christian Hackenberg threw for 315 yards and three touchdowns, and Penn State beat Maryland 31-30 on Saturday to spoil the debut of interim coach Mike Locksley. \nAlthough Hackenberg completed only 13 passes, many of them were big-gainers. Chris Godwin had four catches for 135 yards and DaeSean Hamilton totaled 96 yards on his five receptions. \nHackenberg became the school career leader in completions (608) and yards passing (7,453), displacing Zach Mills in both categories. \nPenn State (6-2, 3-1 Big Ten) improved to 36-2-1 against the Terps, but Maryland’s determined effort before a spirted crowd of 68,948 could help turn this into a regional rivalry. \nLocksley was promoted from offensive coordinator after head coach Randy Edsall was fired on Oct. 11. Although Maryland (2-5, 0-3) led in the fourth quarter and played its best game in a month, the result was all too familiar. \n___ \nAP college football website: http://collegefootball.ap.org Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:41:00.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
