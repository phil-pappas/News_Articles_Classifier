Starters Amos Mason and Will Anthony received the bulk of playing time at the defensive end spots, but gave way occassionally to Jarvis Polu and Sean Reaver. \n\"If I'm getting tired I'll let the coaches know and they'll bring someone else in for a couple plays,\" Sarra said. \"Having me in there for an entire 15-play drive is worse than putting in a fresh Pat Forrestal.\" \nSarra said he will usually make eye contact with assistant defensive line coach Shaun Nua and give the thumbs up or thumbs down sign to let him know if he needs a blow. \n\"If it's a long drive the coaches will get me out for a couple plays, let me catch my breath and get a shot of water,\" Sarra said. \"That's better than leaving me out there and I'm gassed when the ball gets down to the goal line.\" \nOf course, many of the substitutions are dictated by situations such as down and distance or the type of personnel the opponent employs. \nD.J. Palmore (6-3, 227) started Saturday's game at the outside linebacker position known as \"raider\" while Ted Colburn (6-3, 223) earned his first career start at \"striker\" because Pehrson anticipated Connecticut employing a power running game with a two tight end alignment. \n\"We wanted some bigger bodies at outside linebacker to take on those tight ends,\" Pehrson said. \"Our plan didn't exactly work out because they went away from that personnel and used some other formations.\" \nAfter failing to have success running the tailback between the tackles, the Huskies brought in extra receivers and threw the ball a bit more and even went with an empty backfield at times. \nPehrson countered by inserting Kevin McCoy (6-4, 205) and Josiah Powell, who were the starters versus East Carolina. McCoy has already earned a reputation as a pass rush specialist and had a quarterback hurry and two sacks in the fourth quarter against Connecticut. \n\"We're just trying to match size with size and speed with speed,\" Pehrson explained. \"If a team is trying to run the ball then we want some bigger bodies that can hold the point of attack. If they start throwing the ball around, we go with some faster guys that can rush the passer.\" \nThere were a few instances in the Connecticut game when Navy switched from a 3-4 to a 4-3 defensive alignment to counter an obvious running formation. Forrestal played defensive tackle alongside Sarra to create a four-man front. \n\"When they got into big guy run mode we went with our goal-line package,\" Pehrson said. \"We haven't done that much out on the field, but we went to it in this game and it worked pretty well.\" \nPehrson leaves it up to the individual position coaches to decide how and when to substitute. Outside linebackers coach Justin Davis said such decisions are balanced based on giving players a rest and making sure the proper personnel is in the game. \n\"Some of it is game-plan, knowing what their personnel is and how we want to match up against certain looks,\" Davis said. \"Sometimes you have to go off the feel of it. How are guys playing? Are they in a groove or do they look a little tired?\" \nIn years past, Navy might not have been able to shuffle so many different defenders because the talent gap between the starter and the backup was so great. \nOutside linebacker is an example of the new-found depth the Midshipmen have developed with Davis not afraid to play Myer Krah, Mike Kelly and A.K. Akpunku in addition to the aforementioned four. \n\"I have the luxury of good depth right now. I have four guys at the raider and striker positions that I feel I can put in at any time,\" Davis said. \nHead coach Ken Niumatalolo wholeheartedly endorses the use of mass substitutions and felt the benefits showed in the fourth quarter of the last two games when Navy came up with multiple defensive stops. \n\"We have the depth so we need to utilize it. I like the idea of playing more people, especially in this age of up-tempo offenses,\" Niumatalolo said. \nNavy has a solid three-man rotation at inside linebacker with senior Tyler Goble routinely spelling starters Micah Thomas and Daniel Gonzales. \nPehrson said it's a bit more difficult to rotate defensive backs due to the nature of the position. Cornerbacks get accustomed to the speed and style of opposing wide receivers over the course of the game so it does not make sense to constantly rotate them. \nThat being said, the Mids have two talented backup corners in Elijah Merchant and Sean Williams along with some quality reserve safeties such as Daiquan Thomasson and Randy Beggs. \n\"\"It's a little harder to roll guys in the secondary because there is a certain flow back there,\" Pehrson said. \"We have some games coming up against teams like SMU and Memphis that like to throw the ball all over the place when we'll need those young corners.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:40:52.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
