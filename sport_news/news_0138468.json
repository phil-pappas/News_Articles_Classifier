The win puts Mauricio Pochettino's team sixth on 17 points, while Bournemouth stays 17th on eight, two clear of the relegation zone. \n\"I'm delighted to get the three goals,\" said Kane, who before Sunday's game had struggled to recapture the prolific form that saw him net 31 goals last season. \"You have to be patient and keep working hard and the rewards will come. We took our chances and other than the first five minutes, were superb today. We have got to keep progressing.\" \nMousa Dembele put Tottenham ahead eight minutes after Kane's spot kick, and Erik Lamela then tapped in Kane's cross to extend Tottenham's lead. \nKane converted a cross from Christian Eriksen for his second goal after 56 minutes and completed his hat trick seven minutes later, when Bournemouth goalkeeper Artur Boruc parried the ball to his feet from Toby Alderweireld's header. \n\"There was a good feeling after the first goal, but their goals really drained us,\" Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe said. \"There will be no finger pointing. Collective responsibility is important, whether we win or lose.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T18:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:59:19.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
