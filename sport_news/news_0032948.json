Finally.\nPatriots quarterback Tom Brady gets his chance to exact revenge on the organization that sparked the controversy that nearly resulted in his four-game suspension for the Deflategate scandal arising out of last January’s AFC title game.\nAlthough Brady’s NFL-imposed suspension was overturned in federal court by Judge Richard Berman on Sept. 3, before he had to sit out a single game, it’s fair to conclude that Brady would have a little extra motivation Sunday night in Indianapolis.\nIf so, Brady wasn’t revealing it during his weekly press conference yesterday at Gillette Stadium.\nProdded one reporter: “Isn’t there any human part of you that wants it a little extra this week?”\n“I’m a human,” Brady said. “There’s no doubt. I’m definitely human.”\nThen that’s established. Brady is a human.\nHe’s just one who would prefer to sound like a robot on this topic.\n“I’m always pretty motivated,” he said. “It’ll be an exciting game. I know they’ve got a good team. They’ve won three straight. They made some changes this offseason, so they’re a very confident team. So it’s going to take a great effort to beat them, so we’ll work hard at practice today, over the next few days, hopefully get us prepared, and then go out and try to beat a good team on the road on Sunday night.”\nStill, with a game of this magnitude, one has to think that maybe, just maybe, even someone as unflappable as Brady could be thrown off his game. This is, after all, the team that caused his offseason to be embroiled in a courtroom drama and his integrity to be questioned.\nSo, won’t it be a little tougher to remain focused?\n“Well, I try certainly, to be a professional with how I approach every week,” Brady said. “I said (Monday) you really put a lot into it every week no matter who you’re playing because all these games are important. All of them are hard to win. All of them have good players. They’re all pros. They’ve got pro coaches, and they’ve got good schemes.”\nAll great humans in Indianapolis, no doubt, but pressed further on his “motivation,” Brady remained steadfast.\n“Well, like I said, I’m always pretty motivated regardless of the opponent, regardless of the team or the week, whether it’s a preseason game, whether it’s a regular-season game,” he said. “They’re all important because there are so few of those where you get an opportunity in your life, so I don’t take it for granted. I think it’s exciting to go out there and do something that I love to do, to go out there and do it with teammates who I love to play with. We all put a lot of effort in, the coaches, players, so it’s another opportunity for us to go out there and see if we can be a good football team.”\nMaybe it just means something to the fans, fellow humans who undoubtedly will be highly emotional about it.\n“I’m not sure (if it means more to the fans),” Brady said. “As a player, I think you’re just . . . like I said, they’re a very good team, and it’s a challenge to play them on the road. We’ve been there a few times. They’ve got a good team. They’ve won three straight, so it will be a tough game.\n“And hopefully, we’re at our best.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:26:43.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
