NewsRadio WGNS' Bryan Barrett has more on this key matchup... \n\nSmyrna is 4-and-1 in the region and with last week's win over Cookeville, positioned themselves for a home playoff game. However, Smyrna coach Matt Williams says last week's win over Cookeville allowed them to keep their goals in front of them with the Warriors looming... \n\nThe Warriors are coming off a loss to Oakland and are 3-and-2 in region play. They have the same opportunity Smyrna did last week and Riverdale coach Ron Aydelott knows they'll have their hands full... \n\nWith Smyrna hosting Oakland next week and Riverdale hosting Cookeville, the region standings are still very much in the air. Tonight's game will go a long way in clearing things up going into the last week of the regular season. \nState Farm Prep Football coverage from Tomahawk Stadium begins at 6 with the Thompson Services Friday Night Thunder Pregame Show.
