The only undefeated QB not on the list is Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning, who is a lot closer to the cellar than the top. \nThere is a clear correlation between good QB play and success that only a dominant Denver defense seems to defy. Tier I \n1. Tom Brady, Patriots (1) \nEven his first interception wasn't his fault. Brady is strolling and dominating. He's been the best 38-year-old QB I've ever seen. \n2. Andy Dalton, Bengals (2) \nDalton is the NFL's second-leading passer and has the second highest quarterback rating among starting quarterbacks. Also, 14 touchdowns to just two interceptions. \n3. Aaron Rodgers, Packers (3) \nAnother game where Rodgers did nothing special, just enough to win. Sometimes, he just looks like he's cruising out there. Tier II 4. Phillip Rivers, Chargers (5) \nRivers broke San Diego franchise records for completions (43) and passing yards (503) Sunday. He has 355 more passing yards than any other QB in the league. That doesn't make his 2-4 record feel any better, though. \n5. Cam Newton, Panthers (9) \nIt's time to start putting Newton in the MVP race. Forget the numbers, he carried his team to a comeback victory over the Legion of Boom in Seattle Sunday. The Panthers would be nowhere near 5-0 without him. Tier III \n6. Drew Brees, Saints (8) \nBrees is back to his old self completing 77 percent of his passes torching the Falcons defense. \n7. Matt Ryan, Falcons (7) \nMatty Ice flirted with 300 yards, but five sacks and three fumbles was his undoing in a loss to Brees' Saints. \n8. Carson Palmer, Cardinals (4) \nPalmer threw for over 400 yards, but threw two interceptions Sunday in a bad loss to Steelers. \n9. Derek Carr, Raiders \nBye week. Moved up one spot due to overall QB incompetence. \n10. Andrew Luck, Colts (NR) \nLuck had a rough start to the season, but he played really well Sunday when he was less than 100 percent against the undefeated Patriots throwing for over 300 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. \nPeyton Manning Watch (25) \nManning leads the NFL in interceptions with 10. He keeps tumbling down this list, but this appears to be his bottom. At least, Denver can only hope. \nCaught my eye: Brian Hoyer, Texans \nLook at what we have here a Texans quarterback. Hoyer threw for 293 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions Sunday. \nBringing up the rear: Kirk Cousins, Washington \nMaybe Robert Griffin III isn't the answer, but Cousins sure isn't either. He threw two more interceptions Sunday. \nFell out of the rankings: Eli Manning (6) \nCameron Wolfe: 303-954-1891, cwolfe@denverpost.com or @CameronWolfe Get sports news and updates right in your inbox \nSign up to receive news alerts and a daily roundup of all things Colorado sports delivered to your inbox.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:10:23.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
