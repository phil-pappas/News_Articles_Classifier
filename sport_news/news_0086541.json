Utah won 49-27 in the most recent meeting in 2012. \nSTORYLINES: The Bears take aim at their best start since 1950, when they opened 9-0. To get there, they must beat a top-five team for the first time since their 34-31 triple-overtime win over No. 3 USC in 2003. Cal has gone 5-0 six times since '50 without a win in its sixth game. ... Perhaps no team in the country has two wins that compare to Utah's 24-17 victory over Michigan and its 62-20 win at Oregon. ... Cal has held consecutive Pac-12 opponents under 30 points for the first time since October 2012. \nINJURY UPDATE: Cal: DE DeVante Wilson (foot), DT Mustafa Jalil (knee) and RB Daniel Lasco (hip) will play; OT Brian Farley (ankle) is probable. Utah: DE Hunter Dimick (knee) will play; NT Travis Tuiloma (knee) is out. \nMATCHUP TO WATCH: Cal takeaways vs. Utah keep-aways. Can the Bears continue to play the aggressive, opportunistic defense that has allowed them to thrive this season? Utah won't make that easy. The Bears are the NCAA leaders with 18 takeaways, but the Utes have turned the ball over just four times. Cal leads the Pac-12 with 3.6 sacks per game, but Utah has surrendered just one sack all season. Advertisement \nSTATS THAT MATTER: Utah is expecting its 34th consecutive sellout and already this season has played in front of two of the eight biggest crowds in Rice-Eccles history, including the record 47,825 for the opener against Michigan. ... Cal QB Jared Goff has 20 games in his career in which he has passed for at least two touchdowns, including every game this season. ... With 22 career touchdown catches, Kenny Lawler is one shy of matching Wesley Walker (1973-76) for third on Cal's career list. ... Utah quarterback Travis Wilson, who has passed for 513 yards and rushed for 200 in three games, is No. 1 in ESPN's Total QBR rankings. But the Utes rank 126th out of 127 teams nationally in yards per completion at 9.48. -- JEFF FARAUDO", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:33:27.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
