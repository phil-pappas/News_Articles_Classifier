Coach: Mike Krzyzewski. \nConference: Atlantic Coast. \nKey returners: G Grayson Allen, came on strong at the Final Four, scoring 16 points and coming up with the hustle play that sparked a win over Wisconsin. F Amile Jefferson, team’s leading returning scorer (6.1 ppg) does most of the dirty work on the boards. \nWho left: Three one-and-done freshmen — Jahlil Okafor, Tyus Jones, Justise Winslow — moved on to the NBA while graduated senior guard Quinn Cook is trying to find a spot on an NBA roster. \nThe Skinny: Expectations are never low for Coach K’s powerhouse program, which once again replaces stars with stars. The Blue Devils aren’t the likely preseason favorites in the ACC — that belongs to arch rival North Carolina — but could make a run at a Final Four return if these freshmen mesh together as quickly and effectively as last year’s group did.
