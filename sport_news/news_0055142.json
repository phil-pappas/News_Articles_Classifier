Pace looks for its first district win of the season, playing at home against PSJA High in a District 32-5A game at Sams Memorial Stadium. Both games are at 7:30 p.m. Friday. And, St. Joseph Academy opens TAPPS Division I District 2 play on the road against San Antonio Christian at 7 p.m. Friday at Lions Pride Stadium in San Antonio. \nThe Falcons expect another physically demanding game this week against the Hawks, similar to last week’s game against San Benito. \nLos Fresnos won that game 14-7 against the Greyhounds but had to grind it out with a gritty performance. \nLos Fresnos coach Clint Finley takes no stock in Harlingen South’s record. The Hawks’ first three games of the season were against teams that were 11-1. \n“They have some pretty good talent over there,” he said. “They have some pretty special athletes, several play both ways. They’re tough kids, they play hard and they are as dangerous as anyone in the district.” \nHarlingen South coach Lanny Wilson gave the Falcons the same respect. \n“We’re getting a little bit better each week, and we may be playing the best team in the district,” he said. “They’re a really good football team. I would say they’re the district favorites.” \nAndrew Crum covers sports for The Brownsville Herald. You can reach him at (956) 982-6629 or via email at acrum@brownsvilleherald.com .
