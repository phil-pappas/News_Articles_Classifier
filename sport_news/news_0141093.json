That comes as no surprise. Walton had an even easier time, if the final result is any indication, against Rutherford than Navarre's night. That, too, was no shocker. Yet, the only two teams in the Daily News coverage area entering the week undefeated remained so. And now is the time to consider the possibility they never lose. Sure, it would be a historic season for both. Consider that Navarre's program was stuck in 3-7 or 5-5 mediocrity in the years before Jay Walls arrived in 2012. He instantly made the Raiders better -- a 12-2 season came his first year -- but an undefeated campaign would be quite the achievement. Jimmy Ray Stephens' hike up the mountain at Walton has been more in stages. He entered in 2012 to a program that went 0-10 the year before, and each season has won a little more (four games in 2012, five in 2013, seven in 2014). Now he and the Braves are well on track for a District 1-4A title -- just like Navarre is in District 2-6A. In reality, a 10-0 season is simply a fluffed-up undefeated district record. Only three games matter for each program -- and they played the first of them Friday. There is no stopping any team from scheduling rebuilding or consistently down programs for its non-conference schedule to pile up feel-good wins and a hollow, meaningless record. But which team has the better chance at an unblemished regular season? Which team's undefeated start is more impressive? Navarre's schedule -- which hasn't been difficult, except for its home win against Choctaw -- only gets more difficult. The Raiders host non-district foe Escambia, which beat Niceville, before visiting Milton and Gulf Breeze for district showdowns. Navarre ends the season hosting those Niceville Eagles, giving the Raiders' final four opponents a combined 15-9 record. The first six opponents have a 12-24 record. Walton is the opposite, a schedule that started tough and gets easier. The Braves outlasted stiff road tests against Baker and South Walton, and started the year with a home win against Blountstown. Walton's first five opponents have a combined 15-14 record. The next five -- Gulf Breeze, Marianna, Northview, East Gadsden and Bay -- have a 11-15 mark. The toughest two are Marianna and Bay, and only the first matters any toward district standings. Both Navarre and Walton have some tough tests to pass between now and a potential 10-0 record. Coaches love using the \"one game at a time\" cliche, but it's always fun to look ahead and predict the ending.
