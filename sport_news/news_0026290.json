Indianapolis Colts' Matt Hasselbeck (8) throws during the first... Former Seattle Seahawks starting quarterback Matt Hasselbeck will get his second-straight start for the Indianapolis Colts Thursday night, according to a report.\nNFL Media's Ian Rapoport reported that the 40-year-old Hasselbeck -- the oldest non-kicker in the league -- is expected to start for the injured Andrew Luck, who continues to battle back from a shoulder injury.\nThat report was echoed by ESPN's Adam Schefter , who also revealed that Hasselbeck spent a chunk of his week at the hospital following his first start since 2012.\nHassselbeck, like Luck, is listed as questionable for Thursday's matchup with the Houston Texans after he was forced to go to get IV fluids to battle a virus after Sunday's 16-13 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars.\nIn that game, Hasselbeck completed 30 of 47 pass attempts for 282 yards and a touchdown.\nIf both Luck and Hasselbeck are unable to play, the Colts would likely turn to former San Francisco 49ers backup Josh Johnson -- a cousin of Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch -- whom they signed last week.\nHasselbeck started his career as Brett Farve's backup with the Green Bay Packers in 1999 and 2000. After he left Green Bay for the Emerald City, head coach Mike Holmgren traded with the Pack to bring the Boston College product with him to Seattle in 2001.\nHasselbeck spent 10 years with the Seahawks, becoming the franchise's all-time leader in passing yards. He earned three Pro Bowl nods in Seattle and led the Hawks to their first Super Bowl appearance in franchise history following the 2005 season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:49:20.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
