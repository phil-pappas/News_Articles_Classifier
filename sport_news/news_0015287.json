Dale Wallace sounds more like Albert Einstein than a top-tier athlete.\nThe Fordham Prep swimmer can describe the technique involved in his pull out off the wall, where he cups his hands to push the water toward his leg, causing an extra push off his lone dolphin kick.\nPrep coach Dominick Galimi calls it an explosion. Wallace calls it physics, which makes sense considering his academic background.\nThe senior co-captain of the Rams swimming and diving team — which won the state Federation title in Buffalo last month — not only takes AP physics classes, but he has a special interest in hydrodynamics. Next year, Wallace will put his knowledge to work in the classroom and in the pool at the collegiate level. He’s leaning toward attending Cornell, where he’s been accepted, but he’s also considering several other schools.\nWhile most Division I swimmers start when they are 8- or 9-years-old, Wallace waited until his freshman year at Fordham Prep to start swimming competitively. Even then, it wasn’t a particularly serious venture for him.\n“I actually was going to do track, and I used the freshman swim season to get into shape,” Wallace said.\nWith no competitive experience, Wallace swam a 50-yard breaststroke in 35 seconds on his first day.\n“I already had the feel of the water,” he said.\nGalimi convinced Wallace to keep swimming, and Wallace is thrilled that he did.\n“We’re lucky he picked swimming, because he’s a huge help to us,” said co-captain Brian Hogan , who will swim for Yale next year. “He’s a fantastic athlete in other sports, but as far as I’m concerned he picked the right one.”\nIncredibly, Wallace still only swims during the high school season, while most competitive swimmers are in the pool year-round. The rust sets in, Wallace admitted, but technique is his go-to weapon to move past it.\n“I create my own ways to work things out,” he said.\nDuring his first year of swimming, Wallace won the CHSAA freshmen title in the 50-yard breaststroke. As a sophomore, he began swimming what is now his best event, the 100-yard breaststroke.\nA couple of years later, Wallace captained the team to its second straight Federation championship. He took fourth place in the 100-yard breaststroke but had plenty of help from teammates.\nThe Rams scored 199 points at the meet — 75 more than second place Tappan Zee HS.\nWallace believes the Rams are in position to build a dynasty in the pool because of the quality of their younger swimmers.\n“So many kids heard about the program,” Wallace said. “They wanted to swim for us.”\nPRYOR TO SUNY: Jefferson defensive back Kharif Pryor has committed to playing football at SUNY College-Brockport.\nThe two-year varsity starter and team captain, who stands 5-10 and weighs 180 pounds, also plays running back and wide receiver.\nHe scored two touchdowns and had an interception and a sack last season for the Orange Wave.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:52:27.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
