The Mets and Cubs play Game 2 of the NLCS in New York with the first pitch set for 8:07 p.m. The Royals and Blue Jays play Game 3 of the ALCS in Toronto on Monday night. Here's a look at what's happening (all times EDT) : \n5:00 p.m. \nRoyals manager Ned Yost has chosen Chris Young over Kris Medlen as his starter for Game 4 of the ALCS. \nYoung has only made two starts since July 28, but they were good ones. He allowed one run in 11 1-3 innings over those two outings, with his final start coming Oct. 2. \n\"He's got really good numbers against these guys,\" Yost said. \"They're both great choices, but, you know, Chris Young, his last two starts of the year were really, really good for us. We feel like he gives us a good chance to win.\" \nThe 6-foot-10 third round draft pick out of Princeton in 2000 appeared as a reliever in Game 1 of the ALDS, giving up a run in four innings. Overall, he was 11-6 in 34 appearances — 18 starts — this year. \nYoung faced the Blue Jays once this year, on July 11, a 7-5 loss. Edwin Encarnacion hit a two-run shot and Young yielded five hits and three runs over six innings. But over his nine-year career, Young has held members of the Blue Jays to a .229 average (22 for 96) with two homers. \nMedlen was 6-2 with a 4.01 ERA in 15 appearances — eight starts this year. He returned from Tommy John surgery on July 20 and hasn't pitched since Oct. 1. \n4:35 p.m. \nMatt Harvey appears to be set to start for the Mets in Chicago on Thursday if the series reaches a Game 5. \nHarvey joked after Saturday night's opening 4-2 win that Dexter Fowler's line drive \"kind of dented my arm a little bit, got me right in the triceps.\" \nMets manager Terry Collins said \"there were some stitches on Harv's arm last night, so he'll be sore today\" but also said Harvey did not arrive early at Citi Field on Sunday for treatment. \nHarvey allowed two runs and four hits in 7 2/3 innings, struck out nine and walked two. He threw 97 pitches. \n\"We'll see how he is with the bruise and how it's going to affect him,\" Collins said. \"If you're going to come back on four days' rest, keeping his pitch count where it was, I think it will be fine for him.\" \n___ \n3:35 p.m. \nThe Blue Jays just took the field for their off-day workout after returning home from Kansas City down 2-0. After blowing a late lead in a tough 6-3 loss in Game 2, the team knows the challenge ahead: All but three of the previous 25 teams to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven era have won the series. \nToronto trailed 2-0 in the best-of-five ALDS and rallied to beat Texas. \n\"I'm not going to say it's a position we're comfortable being in, but we've been there and we're going to try to go out and win games,\" center fielder Kevin Pillar said. \"That's what we do.\" \n___ \n3:15 p.m. \nThe Yankees may be gone from the postseason, but Alex Rodriguez is sticking around. \nFox said Sunday it has hired A-Rod as a guest analyst for the remainder of the ALCS and the World Series. He is to start Monday, joining pregame and postgame shows that include Pete Rose, Frank Thomas and Raul Ibanez. \nRodriguez returned to the majors this year after serving a season-long suspension for violations of baseball's drug agreement and labor contract. \nHe hit .250 with 33 homers and 86 RBIs, raising his home runs total to 687, behind only Barry Bonds (762), Hank Aaron (755) and Babe Ruth (714).
