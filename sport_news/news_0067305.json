Daniel Gallen Contact Reporter Mike Locksley is confident in Maryland's \"culture\" moving forward from Penn State to Iowa. \nMaryland interim coach Mike Locksley spent almost two weeks working to get his players to loosen up before Saturday’s 31-30 loss to Penn State , in which he saw the fruits of his labor. With a matchup at No. 10 Iowa on deck this weekend, Locksley isn’t worried about getting the Terps’ mood and mindset to carry over. \n“The good thing is I don’t feel like we’re going to have to re-create it,” Locksley said in his Sunday conference call. “I feel like our guys really embraced it. I think they feel like they played better when they’re loose and we’re going to continue to have that type of culture.” \nDuring his two weeks in charge of the program, Locksley has put the focus on the players and urged them to have more fun . \nLocksley said Maryland is using a “24-hour rule” and that after Sunday evening’s practice, the Terps will need to “flush the Penn State stuff” and “hit the reset button” to focus on Iowa. \nLocksley also commended the Terps again for their play against the Nittany Lions despite coming up short because of self-inflicted mistakes. \n“I’m pretty proud and feel good about the way our guys played the whole 60 minutes, which I think this might have been the first game this year that we played productively a full 60-minute game and were right there in it until the end,” Locksley said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:05:05.218+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
