According to King County jail records, he is facing a felony charge of hit-and-run and vehicular assault. He was booked shortly after 1 a.m. PT. The Seattle Times reported Thursday that police in Bellevue, Wash., said Coleman walked away from a crash in which the driver of another car appeared to suffer a broken collarbone.\nColeman, one of the Seahawks’ better special teams players, is legally deaf. He became famous when he was featured in a commercial for Duracell batteries in January 2014.\nThe Seahawks’ quick decision to suspend Coleman is a notable difference from how punishment is typically handled for players arrested during the season, with teams typically deferring to the NFL to handle discipline pending the outcome of the legal process.\nUnder the collective bargaining agreement, teams are allowed to suspend players without pay for conduct detrimental to the team for up to four weeks.\n***\nFollow Lindsay H.
