But one got the feeling that skipping it would have been just fine for everyone involved. Three days after an emotional loss to Mexico drained the team’s energy and brought down a hail of criticism on Coach Jurgen Klinsmann and his players, the Americans pushed their way through an uninspired exhibition at a less-than-half-full Red Bull Arena. That they lost the match, 1-0, did not brighten the mood of the team or the announced crowd of 9,214. “It’s not as easy as it looks out there, man,” striker Jozy Altidore said. “Right now, we’re going through a rough patch.” The loss is sure to increase the pressure on Klinsmann , the coach of the United States men since 2011. The Americans have lost five of their last six games, including embarrassing defeats against Panama and Jamaica in the Gold Cup; the Concacaf Cup loss to Mexico over the weekend; and a humbling loss in a friendly against Brazil. And despite the emotional lift provided by the return of goalkeeper Tim Howard, who made his first appearance since ending a yearlong sabbatical, the Americans were shut out on Tuesday for the first time since a loss to Germany at the 2014 World Cup and blanked at home for the first time in nearly three years .

Klinsmann, however, dismissed questions — again — about whether the recent defeats should cost him his job. He seemed confident, completely at ease — again — smiling through his news conference after the game. “There are not only sunny days,” Klinsmann said. “We’ve had a lot of sunshine — 2012, 2013, 2014. Now it’s raining a little bit.” U.S. Soccer’s president, Sunil Gulati, attended Tuesday’s match and would say only that he and Klinsmann had spoken since Saturday’s loss. The Americans are not set to gather again until November, when they open the 2018 World Cup qualifying cycle with matches against St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Trinidad and Tobago. “It’s not part of my character to give up just because we’ve had a couple of bad results,” Klinsmann said. “That sits in your stomach. That drives you even more.” But, he added, “I’m not only the coach in good times; I’m here also to take the team through tough times.” That is what they are. Tuesday was just the latest in a string of frustrating results, starting with an early exit from the Concacaf Gold Cup over the summer and extending to Saturday’s defeat to Mexico at the Rose Bowl, when the Americans absorbed nearly two hours of pressure only to surrender the winning goal minutes from the end. Klinsmann’s lineup had a thrown-together feel. Any hopes for a more attacking mind-set disappeared with the announcement that Jermaine Jones and Danny Williams, neither of whom is known as particularly creative, would start in central midfield. Altidore and Gyasi Zardes started up front, as they did Saturday, but were again ineffective. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:19:58.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
