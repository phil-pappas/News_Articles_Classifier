Fly balls should carry a lot further under the climate-controlled closed dome than they did in the chilly Kansas City air. The Rogers Centre averaged 2.51 home runs per game this season, third-most in the league, while Kauffman Stadium averaged the fewest at 1.6 per game. Of all the home-field advantages, this is the biggest for the Jays, whose offence is built around the long ball.\nCain is able\nLorenzo Cain, the Royals’ centre-fielder who won the ALCS MVP last year, is on an 11-game post-season hit streak, dating back to last year’s World Series. Cain’s seven hits this post-season are one back of Ben Zobrist for the Royals’ lead. Blue Jays’ first baseman Chris Colabello and centre-fielder Kevin Pillar are tied with Royals’ shortstop Alcides Escobar for the AL lead with nine playoff hits.\nDevo back in town\nDevon White, the former Jays’ centre-fielder who played in Toronto from 1991-95, will throw out the ceremonial first pitch tonight. The speedy lead-off hitter ignited the Jays’ WAMCO (White-Alomar-Molitor-Carter-Olerud) offence during the World Series glory years and was one of the greatest defensive outfielders in franchise history. He ranks ninth among all-time Blue Jays in Wins Above Replacement, according to Fangraphs.\n-\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\nEdwin Encarnacion: The Blue Jays’ designated hitter has only faced Cueto seven times in his career, but he has two singles, a double and a home run.\nEric Hosmer: The Royals’ first baseman has six hits this post-season and all of them have driven in runs.\nMore on thestar.com\nVery little sympathy for 'injured' soccer player\nSteelers Cam Heyward will be fined $11K for honoring his late father", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:22:02.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
