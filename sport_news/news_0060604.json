Taft answered with the final three points to win the first set. Taft carried that momentum into the second set where they outscored Robert F. Kennedy 4-1. The Lady Thunderbirds bounced back to tie the score at four. The teams would tie each other three more times before Taft attempted to pull away with a 4-0 run. The Lady Thunderbirds whittled the deficit down to three but Taft took off with an 8-2 run to lead 19-10. Robert F. Kennedy snapped the streak but Taft followed up with a 6-2 to run to take the second set. Like the previous two sets, the Lady Wildcats took off at the start of the third set with a 5-1 run. The Lady Thunderbirds would cut the lead in half at 6-3 and again at 8-4 but that was the last time the third set was close. Over the following moments of the set, the Lady Wildcat went on a 17-1 run including 12 straight points to begin the run to win the set and match.
