The match was suspended twice after fans threw projectiles including glass bottles onto the pitch. \nMarseille had already been hit with a provisional sanction and played its previous home game against Angers in a half-empty stadium. The league said \"as a consequence, the sanction will be implemented on the South stand for the Marseille vs. Lorient match.\" \nMarseille, which hosts Lorient on Sunday, was also handed a suspended one-match stadium ban and a 40,000 euro ($45.000) fine. \nThe match against Lyon was played in a toxic atmosphere. Marseille striker Michy Batshuayi was hit by a fire bomb but escaped uninjured and police forces were deployed in front of the Marseille fans. The supporters also caused widespread indignation after they hung an effigy of former player Mathieu Valbuena, who was booed during the whole game on his return to the southern club. \nWith the 2016 European Championship to be held in France next year, Sports secretary Thierry Braillard called for tougher security checks in stadiums after the incidents. \nMarseille president Vincent Labrune has since met with the main supporters groups and safety nets separating fans from the pitch have been reintroduced inside the Velodrome. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:27:49.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
