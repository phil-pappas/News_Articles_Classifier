(For OzarksSportsZone.com) -- The Stockton girls took first overall at the Ash Grove Cross Country Invitational Tuesday with 35 points. Strafford boys claimed the top spot with 28 points. Stockton’s Lena Pohlsander (jr.) took the lead on a curve early in the race. Pohlsander took first place with a 21:12 time, a comfortable 40-second lead over her teammate Ciara Cargill in second. CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS Cargill (sr.) fought hard for that second place spot, sprinting to the line and beating out Strafford’s McKenzi Maples by nine seconds. Cargill had that finish line in mind from the start.“It felt like death, that’s for sure,” said Cargill. “I set a goal for every race, and this one was top five, because that’s what my coach informed me that I could do. I just knew that if I kept my teammate in sight, that could help me push and I wouldn’t get distracted. I knew somebody was coming up behind me, and I wanted second really bad. I had to gut it out. I can’t leave anything out here. I don’t have another year for it.” This was Pohlsander’s first time in the top spot.“At the beginning, I was in sixth or seventh, and I just had to surge on the corner to break out of the group,” said Pohlsander. “Once you go fast, just keep going fast. You can’t give up, or you might get passed.” The Stockton girls also took the number-five, eight, and nine conference spots, for an overall win. Coach T. J. Sanderson was especially happy with the conference win. “Our girls’ team the last five years has been pretty solid,” said Sanderson. “Lena and Ciara have been contributors, consistent throughout. I didn’t know they were going one and two today; that was a pleasant surprise. Obviously the goal each year is to advance to state. That’s our goal, whether we get first or second.” Strafford’s Shane Burns (jr.) took first with a 16:25 finish. Burns was dogged by Humansville’s Dustin Shoemaker the whole way.“Dustin Shoemaker was right behind me,” said Burns. “He was pushing me the entire way. I kept on seeing him as we looped back around.” Shoemaker took second place overall with a 16:36 finish, 11 seconds behind Burns.“At the beginning, Shane was a lot closer,” said Shoemaker. “But he got that gap on me. He didn’t get any farther away, but I couldn’t get any closer to him. I may gain a little bit of ground at the hills, but he would just push it back down and gain it back again.” Strafford boy took first place overall. The Indians took the top three conference spots, along with fifth, eighth, and ninth. Coach Duane Fabro sees the team building in strength.“Shane is running really well for us, but Shane can only do so much; you’ve gotta have four more,” said Fabro. “So Jake Clements and Trevor Roebke have really done well. What’s making us a little more successful is that Matt Barrett-Young is moving up closer in to the number-four spot, and Jacob Davis, our number-five kid, is just doing remarkable. He’s coming up leaps and bounds.” BOYS 1 Shane Burns 16:25 1 Strafford 2 Dustin Shoemaker 16:36 Humansville 3 Tristan Eaton 16:42 Sparta 4 Jacob Clements 17:24 2 Strafford 5 Trevor Roebke 17:29 3 Strafford 6 Logan Holliman 17:34 4 Fair Grove 7 Matt Barrett-Young 17:42 5 Strafford 8 Zach Adams 17:44 6 Stockton 9 Cameron Thomas 17:52 7 Stockton 10 Gavin Herd 17:53 Chadwick 11 Jacob Davis 18:05 8 Strafford 12 Broque Decker 18:06 Humansville 13 Patrick Davis 18:07 9 Strafford 14 Colby Gilbert 18:09 Clever 15 Jeremiah Ellison 18:19 Sparta 16 Tyler Countryman 18:25 Fair Play 17 Joseph Dearman 18:29:34 10 Stockton 18 Brandon McClain 18:29:68 11 Pleasant Hope 19 Ryan Duke 18:34 12 Pleasant Hope 20 Logan Braudway 18:41 Sparta 21 Morgan Thomas 18:44 13 Stockton 22 Freddie Wieder 18:45 Humansville 23 Ryan Odom 18:46 14 Fair Grove 24 Evan Smith 18:50 Chadwick 25 Matthew House 18:51 Fair Play 26 Ryan Rutledge 18:53 Fair Play 27 Eric McDowell 19:03 Humansville 28 Cooper Locke 19:08 15 Stockton 29 Sean Lowry 19:14 Wheaton 30 Patrick Dearman 19:17 16 Stockton GIRLS 1 Lena Pohlsander 21:12 1 Stockton 2 Ciara Cargill 21:52 2 Stockton 3 McKenzi Maples 22:01 3 Strafford 4 Melanie Hall 22:16:49 4 Ash Grove 5 Luella Bradshaw 22:16:98 5 Stockton 6 Erin Hall 22:36 6 Ash Grove 7 Haylee Wallin 22:38 Clever 8 Ashley Pearce 22:42 Clever 9 Emma Wells 22:51 7 Pleasant Hope 10 Ashley Hutchinson 22:57 Sparta 11 Memhpis Coble 23:18 Humansville 12 Kacey Hottes 23:41 8 Stockton 13 Morgan Waisner 23:50:09 Clever 14 Hannah Hudson 23:50:96 Sparta 15 Sarrah Hottes 23:54 9 Stockton 16 Maya Fabes 24:09 10 Strafford 17 Karissa Coble 24:30 Humansville 18 Ashley Rice 24:35 11 Fair Grove 19 Brooklyn Talley 24:38 12 Stockton 20 Brooke Haeft 24:42 Clever 21 Brittany Blankenship 24:50 13 Skyline 22 Kayla Bruemmer 24:51 14 Fair Grove 23 Zoe Tyson-Knight 25:09 15 Fair Grove 24 Tessa Broome 25:14 Clever 25 Lauren Nimmo 25:19 16 Fair Grove 26 Megan Holland 25:37 17 Fair Grove 27 Mikyla Hutchinson 25:49 Sparta 28 Naomi Hill 25:51 18 Ash Grove 29 Lilly White 26:08 Humansville 30 Ella Hymes 26:32 19 Fair Grove", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:43:25.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
