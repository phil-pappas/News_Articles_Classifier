By NATE ALLEN SPECIAL TO THE LOG CABIN \nFAYETTEVILLE - After a Sunday film review of their 27-13 SEC West loss last Saturday at Alabama and Monday off while their coaches recruited, the Arkansas Razorbacks begin their bye week practices today. \nCoach Bret Bielema has the Razorbacks set to practice Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday before he and his staff spend Thursday night into Saturday recruiting. \nArkansas, 2-4, 1-2 in the SEC West, doesn’t play again until hosting SEC West rival Auburn on Oct. 24 at Reynolds Razorback Stadium. \nAuburn, 3-2, 0-2, and coming off a bye week, Thursday night visits Kentucky in a SEC game. \nDuring Saturday’s postgame in Tuscaloosa, Ala. Bielema addressed his bye week plans which includes healing time for those playing through injuries. \n“As coaches will go out and do a little recruiting on Sunday and Monday,” Bielema said. “Tuesday we’ll take a peek at Auburn and get some jump on them. We will work them a little Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and put some \npieces in place for the Auburn prep as well. We will have to get back to some of our guys that we need to keep developing for the last half of this season to keep getting better.” \nEspecially with the Razorbacks at 2-4, requiring a minimum 4-2 finish to just to be 6-6 bowl eligible come December, this is the most important autumn week for those redshirting or not playing much this year but with aspirations to increase their roles next season. \n‘We will have to get back to some of our guys that we need to keep developing for the last half of this season to keep getting better,” Bielema said. \nBielema indicated much of Thursday’s practice will be devoted to scrimmaging the redshirts and seldom-used reserves which he will do extensively in December if the Hogs are bowl eligible. \nOtherwise they can’t practice in pads until spring. \nMore work for the underplayed and easing up on the banged up seem the priorities. \n“This week will be good for us,” Arkansas senior quarterback Brandon Allen said. “A lot of guys are banged up after playing six straight games. We can get a lot of guys healthy in two weeks.” \nBielema concurred. \n“We’ve got to get some guys healthy,” Bielema said. “We’re banged up at certain positions. We’ve got to be smart about that as coaches but continue to get better at the areas of need.” \nThe bye week seems particularly crucial for receiver Dominique Reed, the Camden Fairview grad and junior transfer via Coffeyville (Kan.) Community College. \nReed spent most of the summer completing his Coffeyville credits so was behind in the Arkansas nuances and assignments while his teammates were working out together in Fayetteville. That has manifested at times, in him not running the proper routes, Bielema and receivers coach Michael Smith have said, but he brings speed surpassing Arkansas’ experienced receivers. \nReed’s speed turned a short Brandon Allen pass into a 33-yard touchdown two Saturdays ago in Arkansas’ 24-20 SEC victory at Tennessee and he caught a 54-yard touchdown from Allen against Alabama. \nAlthough the 2-4 record does not befit projections a Razorbacks team opening the season ranked 18th in the AP poll, Bielema said he sees his team progressing including staying in the fight against 16-point favorite Alabama with a 7-3 lead into third quarter. \n“Unfortunately we’re a 2-4 team and that doesn’t settle well with me, our players, our fans and everybody,” Bielema said. “But I know we’re getting better. I am excited to coach the last six games with these guys.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:04:41.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
