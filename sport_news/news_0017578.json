Though he’s missed the last two games with a shoulder injury, Luck likely will play Sunday night. If he does he’ll need to improve on his four-game history in which he’s been outscored, 189-93. Luck has thrown six touchdowns and 10 interceptions in those games, with a quarterback rating of 58.7.\nNov. 18, 2012 at Gillette Stadium\nPATRIOTS 59, COLTS 24\nLuck: 27-50 334 yards 2 TD 3 INT 63.3 Rating\nBrady: 24-35 331 yards 3 TD 0 INT 127.2 Rating\nSkinny: More than the Patriots’ domination and the two interceptions the Pats returned for touchdowns (Aqib Talib, Alfonzo Dennard), this one will be remembered as the game Rob Gronkowski broke his arm while blocking on an extra point late in the game.\nJan. 11, 2014 at Gillette Stadium (AFC Divisional playoff)\nPATRIOTS 43, COLTS 22\nLuck: 20-41 331 yards 2 TD 4 INT 53.0 Rating\nBrady: 13-25 198 yards 0 TD 0 INT 78.4 Rating\nSkinny: With LaGarrette Blount running 24 times for 166 yards, Brady barely broke a sweat in this playoff game. Colts cut it to 7 late in the third quarter, but a Luck interception and more Blount helped the Pats pull away.\nNov. 16, 2014 at Lucas Oil Stadium\nPATRIOTS 42, COLTS 20\nLuck: 23-39 303 yards 2 TD 1 INT 90.0 Rating\nBrady: 19-30 257 yards 2 TD 2 INT 85.0 Rating\nSkinny: Piggy-backing on the Colts’ questionable run defense, little-known Jonas Gray made a name for himself by rushing for 201 yards and four TDs. Luck was a little better, but not against Darrelle Revis, who blanketed his best weapon, Reggie Wayne.\nJan. 18, 2015 at Gillette Stadium (AFC Championship Game)\nPATRIOTS 45, COLTS 7\nLuck: 12-33 126 yards 0 TD 2 INT 23.0 Rating\nBrady: 23-35 226 yards 3 TD 1 INT 100.4 Rating\nSkinny: The game that spurred Deflategate. The Patriots scored 28 unanswered second-half points to make this a laugher and punch their ticket to the Super Bowl. Not many were laughing all offseason when the alleged deflated balls turned into an all-encompassing story.\nLuck totals: 82-163 1,094 yards 6 TD 10 INT 58.7 Rating\nBrady totals: 79-125 1,012 yards 8 TD 3 INT 99.8 Rating", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:51:52.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
