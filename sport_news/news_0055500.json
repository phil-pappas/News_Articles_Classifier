Lee football team that Scott Girolmo is coaching is not the team he was told to expect. \nIn fact, the first-year head coach, who has guided the Leemen to a 3-3 record thus far, was told to expect the worst. \n\"I was told they were front-runners,\" he said. \"I was told that they couldn't handle adversity, that they would fold up under pressure and self-destruct. Well, I can tell you that's the exact opposite of what I've seen the last few weeks.\" \nFor evidence of that, look no further that Lee's 27-13 win at Broadway on Thursday night. \nThe Leemen started slow, allowing a 72-yard return of the opening kickoff that set up the Gobblers' first touchdown. Lee then fumbled the ball away on consecutive possessions and were in danger of letting a crucial game slip away. \nHowever, the Leemen shook off the slow start and the swampy field conditions to score four straight touchdowns to take a 27-7 lead into the fourth quarter. Junior Brendon Witherspoon scored on runs on 7 and 8 yards, Zach Simmons scampered for a 29-yard TD and quarterback Tavion Brown capped Lee's rally with a 57-yard run to paydirt. \nThe win not only brought Lee back to the .500 mark, it also gave them a win over a 3A opponent that will go a long way toward improving their playoff position in 2A East. \n\"It's the second week in a row that the kids have demonstrated a resiliency and determination,\" Girolmo said. \"We've fallen behind to good teams in Turner Ashby and Broadway. In both cases, our kids have fought back tooth and nail to either regain a lead or at least put them in a position to win a football game. \n\"Any time you can beat a good football team like Broadway on the road, in the nasty, swampy conditions we played in, and despite all the turnovers, it's a testament to the kind of kids they are,\" he added. \nThe fact is, in Girolmo's eyes, that his players have grown since they first started practice in August. \n\"I've told them that it's not about what's happened in the past before I got here,\" he said. \"It's about what you've done since the summer and what you've as a group to build yourselves from the time we stepped on the field for our scrimmage against Buffalo Gap to what we do as we prepare for a tough homecoming game against Waynesboro.\" \nTried and true \nRiverheads did what it does best in its 21-14 comeback win over Buffalo Gap on Thursday. \nDown 14-7 early in the second half, the Gladiators dug deep on both sides of the ball, slowing down the Bison's running game and getting a pair of interceptions, while the offense put together two scoring drives that kept the Red Pride unbeaten at 5-0. \nThe rushing attack combined for 131 yards on 26 carries in the second half, with 104 of those yards coming on the two scoring drives. \n\"I could see the confidence in our kids,\" Riverheads coach Robert Casto said. \"They just kept plugging and plugging, and good things happened for us at the end. \n\"Our kids aren't going to give up,\" he added. \"They're just going to keep working and working.\" \nA shutout sometimes isn't a shutout \nIt’s not often you hear a coach upset about his defense following a shutout, but Stuarts Draft’s Nathan Floyd wasn’t buying that his team won on defense Thursday night after blanking Stonewall Jackson 47-0. \n“We were reaching and grabbing instead of squaring up and hitting,” said Floyd. “The zero looks good on the scoreboard, but coaching-wise we’re not too happy with the defense right now.” \nThe Cougars have shutout two opponents this season, opening the season with a 49-0 win over Fort Defiance before blanking the Generals on Friday. But in the two wins before Friday, Draft gave up 62 points in a pair of wins. \nOn the season, Draft is giving up 16.2 points a game so, in as far as the coaching staff is concerned, there is still room for improvement. \n“Still working on it,” said Floyd. “Still trying to get the best out of our kids right now. Still haven’t reached that yet.” \n— Staff writer Patrick Hite contributed to this story. 2 CONNECT 2   Read or Share this story: http://www.newsleader.com/story/sports/2015/10/05/hs-football-notes-from-gridiron-20151005/73384318/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:46:59.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
