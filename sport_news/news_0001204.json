The team's starting and backup point guards, Chris Paul and Austin Rivers , both sustained injuries that kept them out of the Clippers' exhibition game with the Charlotte Hornets in Shenzhen, China on Saturday. Paul fractured his left index finger during a team scrimmage on Saturday, according to the Orange County Register . Paul shouldn't miss much time, according to the team, as the injury isn't as serious as it sounds. The incident occurred as Paul drove to the basket and hit his hand in practice. He could return as early as Wednesday when the team plays the Hornets in Shanghai, China. Rivers lost five teeth after an inadvertent elbow from rookie forward Branden Dawson when Rivers went up for a dunk during the team's scrimmage on Friday. Rivers had surgery to put the teeth back in place. \"It just hit me right in the mouth,\" Rivers told Clippers.com . \"They brought me into surgery, just numbed my whole face. It took like two and a half hours. The Clippers have listed Rivers as \"day to day,\" and he's unlikely to return to play until they come back to the United States next week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:50:59.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
