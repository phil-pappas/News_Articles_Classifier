Noel passed for one touchdown and ran for another, and Sacred Heart's defense forced eight turnovers to defeat Robert Morris 26-13 on Saturday. \nThe Pioneers (3-2, 1-0), with the Northeast Conference's top rush defense, held Robert Morris (2-4, 1-1), the Northeast's second-leading rushing team, to minus-7 yards on the ground. Sacred Heart forced three Robert Morris players into seven fumbles and recovered four. The Pioneers also picked off Colonials quarterback Luke Brumbaugh three times. \nNoel, who completed 21 of 40 for 222 yards, hit Jalyn Croom with a 36-yard strike to open the scoring. Ose Imeokparia and Noel scored on runs of 1 and 6 yards, and Alec Finney added two field goals. \nNeither Robert Morris TD came from its offense: Jimmy Masson intercepted Noel and returned it 49 yards to bring Robert Morris to 14-7 and Dante Satcher returned a kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T23:47:59.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
