The obvious loss people immediately think of is All-American safety Karl Joseph. A non-contact practice drill proved to be the last football activity he would partake in after suffering a knee injury. Joseph led the nation in interceptions and maintained his role as one of the hardest hitters in college football by routinely separating his man from the ball. Considered to be the team’s inspirational leader on defense, the Mountaineers have looked to other seniors like KJ Dillon and Terrell Chestnut to take the reins. Unfortunately for head coach Dana Holgorsen and defensive coordinator Tony Gibson, Chestnut came out of last weekend’s game against Baylor with some lingering shoulder soreness and has yet to practice this week as he’s listed day-to-day. \"He’s had a shoulder (injury) for quite some time,\" Holgorsen said. \"He had it before the (Baylor) game and tried to play through it.\" On the offensive side of the ball, WVU found itself a bit banged up on the offensive line. Holgorsen said freshman left tackle Yodny Cajuste was feeling the effects of three straight top 25 opponents, and Tyler Orlosky was having trouble walking during practice this week. With backup linemen like Tony Matteo and Stone Underwood, Holgorsen feels he has a few guys who are able to step up and allow the line to not skip a beat; however, he would certainly like the potential future star Cajuste and Rimington Trophy-hopeful Orlosky taking the reps. Another reason is to help create holes for running back Wendell Smallwood, who has been a revelation for the Mountaineers in this season’s rushing attack. Smallwood has reportedly not practiced in nearly two weeks with a lingering injury but will absolutely be needed if West Virginia hopes to break its three game losing streak. Smallwood has recorded 678 rushing yards and five touchdowns on the season, including an average of 6.7 yards per carry. Last weekend’s lossto Baylor was the second game in which he hasn’t found his way into the end zone. \"A lot has been said about (Smallwood), and certain guys are questioning why we’re not using him so much,\" Holgorsen said. \"I assure you, we would use him as much as we can. He hasn’t practiced a day in the past two weeks, and he just gets out there and gives everything he’s got for the team.\" Holgorsen said 3-0 was the team’s goal after their non-conference slate, but 3-3 and 0-3 in the Big 12 likely wasn’t on the ball for the Mountaineers. \"We need this week. We’ve had four hard games in a row, and the rest will do them all some good. We’ll utilize this week to get everyone as healthy as we can,\" Holgorsen said. If West Virginia can’t find a way to put a healthy team on the field, it could find itself below .500 and on the wrong end of a four-game losing streak. Unfortunately for the Mountaineers, next Thursday’s game won’t do them any favors as they’re thrown into a hostile environment against No. 4 TCU, who is 7-0 on the year and hasn’t lost at home in their last 10 attempts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:58:10.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
