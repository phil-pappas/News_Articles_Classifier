A month ago on \"Sunday Night Football,\" the Giants suffered through the embarrassment of a mind-numbing, last-second loss. Now, on the heels of two straight victories, they could step on the field this week with a chance to claim sole possession of first place in the NFC East. \n49ers: Gone is the presence of Jim Harbaugh to Michigan's Big House and any magic associated with the 49ers in their successful runs in 2011 (NFC title game), 2012 (Super Bowl) and 2013 (NFC title game). New coach Jim Tomsula has his hands full with significant members of the team retired (LB Chris Borland, DT Justin Smith, LB Patrick Willis, LT Anthony Davis) or released (LB Aldon Smith). The optimism gained on opening night via a win over the Vikings has disappeared following three consecutive losses. \nKey matchup \n49ers QB Colin Kaepernick vs. Giants secondary. Kaepernick threw four interceptions and finished with a career-low 16.7 passer rating against the Cardinals two weeks ago. Against the Packers, his passer rating was 55.4 and the 49ers managed to score only three points. There was even some talk this week that the 49ers should turn to backup Blaine Gabbert. Facing Bills dual-threat QB Tyrod Taylor last week should help in the preparation to stop Kaepernick. Yes, the Giants are vulnerable to the pass — they are ranked last in the league in yards allowed — but the tandem of CBs Prince Amukamara and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie is among the league's most underrated. Rookie safety Landon Collins and veteran Brandon Meriweather have started to click, too. \nHow they'll win \nGiants: Eli Manning threw five interceptions against the 49ers last season as San Francisco prevailed, 16-10. The 49ers have yet to score a first-quarter touchdown this season and haven't had a lead since during their Week 1 win over the Vikings. Expect big games for WR Odell Beckham Jr. and TE Larry Donnell. Last season, Donnell caught three passes for 54 yards and a touchdown against the 49ers. He could end up exploiting rookie S Jaquiski Tartt in the middle of the field. The Giants set the edge exceptionally well in forcing Taylor to beat them from the pocket last week, and they'll need that kind of performance against Kaepernick this week. No TE Vernon Davis for the 49ers takes some pressure off, too. \n49ers: The 49ers rank fifth in the NFL in rushing, with an average of 130.2 yards per game. The Giants have the best rushing defense in the NFL, having allowed 69.8 yards per game. Something's got to give, and in order to take pressure off Kaepernick, RB Carlos Hyde must produce, at least early on. After collecting 168 yards and two touchdowns in his first NFL start, Hyde has totaled 114 yards in his last three games. OLB Aaron Lynch could provide the season's greatest test for Giants RT Marshall Newhouse with his speed off the edge. \n— Art Stapleton © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:22:48.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
