Lt. John Duprey said police were called to Culver's at 2800 S. Minnesota Avenue before 9 a.m. Tuesday after a fake $50 bill was found. \nAt 2:45 p.m., police were called to Culver's at 5601 E. Arrowhead Parkway when an employee spotted a fake $100 from a drive-thru customer. Duprey said the suspect left before officers arrived. \nDuprey said detectives think that fast food restaurants are being targeted, specifically at the drive-thru. \n\"That can be a very rushed time for the employees,\" Duprey said. \"We would ask if that's your job that you be as observant as you can.\" \nAt 7 a.m. Tuesday, police were called to Freedom Valu Center, 2601 W. 12th Street, after a 20-year-old man tried to use a fake $100 bill. Joshua Charles Wood was arrested at the store, and police said he was cooperative. \nPolice are unsure if the cases are connected, but detectives are working with the U.S. Secret Service during the investigation.
