Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports) \nRebounding \nHow does a team respond to an embarrassing loss? \nWell I guess we'll find out Saturday, when the Arizona State Sun Devils take on the UCLA Bruins. \n\"We're excited to see how we can respond Saturday on the field,\" said quarterback Mike Bercovici on Thursday. \nHead coach Todd Graham said Tuesday was \"the best practice we've had all year.\" \nSo will this lead to a major Pac-12 victory for ASU? \nWe'll have to wait and see, but these are the type of games that define a program. \nAfter the sluggish start to the season, the Sun Devils are in desperate need of a win, and to establish an identity. \nRoller-coaster series \nThis series has been a back-and-forth slugfest over the past couple years. \nLast season, the Bruins came into Tempe and crushed the Sun Devils, winning 62-27. Two years ago, ASU beat UCLA in LA 38-33. \nThree years ago, it was the Bruins getting the better of ASU. \nYou see where I'm going with this. \nHistory says this is ASU's year for a victory, but based on how these two teams have looked, it seems ASU is in for a huge, uphill climb. ASU Football feels it has responded this week KPNX \nDo or die \nThis is the Sun Devils season. \nYes, they'll still play games regardless of what happens on Saturday night. \nIf ASU lays an egg like they did against USC though, you can stick a fork in them, they're done. \nSure, Sun Devil fans would love a victory this Saturday, but what they really want is to see just a glimpse of what Graham said was the best team he's ever coached. \nASU just needs to put together a good game. \nBased on what the Sun Devils have done so far, it's unlikely they beat UCLA. If they can string together four quarters and keep it close however, there will be some reason for hope. \nIf they get their doors blown off again, ASU fans will have to keep their fingers crossed for a bid to the Las Vegas Bowl.
