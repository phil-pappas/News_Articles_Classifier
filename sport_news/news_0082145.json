There was initially some thought that his hip injury was similar to the one that ended Jackson’s NFL career back in 1991. \n“But as it turned out, it wasn’t the same thing – they told us Jalen got lucky,” Rick Jackson, Watts-Jackson’s father, said. “Everything’s looking good after the surgery and this isn’t gonna be a career-ending injury.” \nDoctors immediately re-set the hip Saturday night, moments after Watts-Jackson grabbed a fumble from U-M punter Blake O’Neill and raced 38 yards for a 27-23 MSU win over U-M at the buzzer. Surgery to repair the fracture took place Sunday. Watts-Jackson is due home today in East Lansing, on crutches. \nThen it’ll be rehab and rooting, for the No. 7 Spartans (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten) as they continue chasing the championships Watts-Jackson’s play kept viable. If all works out as well as possible, Jackson said, his son could potentially be active for spring ball. \nBefore any of that, the family just wants to celebrate. There hasn’t been much of that yet. It’s all gone so fast, starting with the play Watts-Jackson’s family didn’t realize was happening until later. UPDATED: Best of the web on the best game ever \nIn fact, they had started to walk up the stairs from their seats near the north end zone where Watts-Jackson scored the winning touchdown. After U-M punter Blake O’Neill fumbled the snap, he took a hit from Grayson Miller and Matt Morrissey as he tried to punt it, and the ball popped into Watts-Jackson’s hands. \nWatts-Jackson got what Mark Dantonio called a “huge” block from Jermaine Edmondson, who pulled his hand away to avoid a holding call as he engaged with U-M’s Wayne Lyons and Watts-Jackson cut inside. \nButt sprinted in from the side and tried to pull Watts-Jackson back, but it was too late by then. As they hit the turf, Watts-Jackson was already in searing pain. \n“You can’t blame him at all,” Jackson said of Butt. “He was just trying to keep Jalen from getting in there.” \nThe family isn’t sure if the injury was worsened by the pile-up of celebrating MSU players afterward, but Watts-Jackson was in agony from the start and screaming for everyone to get off him. \n“It’s unfortunate everybody piled on him,” Dantonio said, “but you know, I think people started figuring out pretty quickly what was going on.” \nMeanwhile, Jackson and other family members looked back to see the end of the incredible play, not realizing it was Watts-Jackson scoring or at the bottom of the growing pile of MSU players. They got up to the concourse and walked around through the masses to the east side of the stadium, then re-entered to stand near the tunnel and try to find Watts-Jackson. \nThat’s when an MSU staffer told Jackson that it was his son who had scored, and that he had been carted off and rushed to U-M Hospital. As Jackson took off, he pulled out his phone and realized it had been besieged with calls and texts. \nHe called Terra Watts, Watts-Jackson’s mother, who wasn’t able to make the game, and she quickly made the drive from Detroit to Ann Arbor. Watts-Jackson screamed in pain as the ambulance hit a bump on the way to the hospital, Jackson said, but his pain level went down dramatically when he arrived and doctors quickly re-set the hip. \nJackson watched the play for the first time, fully understanding what was happening and who was doing it, on his phone. His initial reaction: “It’s crazy.” \n“He’s been making big plays like this all his life,” said Jackson, of Detroit, who works as a production supervisor for auto parts supplier Kwang Jin America, Inc., in Madison Heights. “Whenever he’s had an opportunity to shine, he’s taken advantage of it.” \nThe 5-foot-11, 192-pound Watts-Jackson grew up in Detroit and played his high school ball for George Porritt at football power Orchard Lake St. Mary. Jackson said it was well worth the long drives north every morning to the suburbs to take his son there. \nWatts-Jackson was a three-year starter at defensive back and receiver, and returns for touchdowns were a big part of his game – he had three on punts, two on interceptions. He was not a superstar recruit, but he had offers from Iowa and Purdue before picking the Spartans. \nWatts-Jackson redshirted last season and has been a fixture on special teams as a redshirt freshman. He saw some action on defense in MSU’s Sept. 12 win over Oregon, and Dantonio said Sunday that Watts-Jackson was “about ready to start playing for us” more in nickel situations. \nThen came the play, a play that will rank up there in MSU-Michigan lore with Larry Caper’s overtime run to win in 2009; Jeff Smoker’s pass to T.J. Duckett for the win as a final, disputed second ticked off in 2001; and Tony Banks’ winning touchdown pass to Nigea Carter in 1995. \nDantonio compared it with two stunning plays to win previous huge games for MSU, the “Little Giants” fake field goal to beat Notre Dame in overtime in 2010 and the Hail Mary from Kirk Cousins to Keith Nichol to beat Wisconsin in 2011. \nIt is already being discussed among the most incredible finishes in college football history, right up there with Cal’s kickoff return full of laterals to beat Stanford in 1982 and the Auburn kick return on a missed field goal to beat Alabama two years ago. \nAfter hoarsely calling the play, ESPN play-by-play announcer Sean McDonough said of Watts-Jackson: “He is now a Michigan State legend, and in the history books of this rivalry forever.” \n“I mean, that’s a legendary play,” MSU junior defensive back Demetrious Cox said. “That’s a play, he showed a lot of heart, man.” \nWatts-Jackson watched the play for the first time Sunday morning, before his surgery. Jackson said there wasn’t a lot of reaction at first but “we keep watching it over and over.” \nWatts-Jackson is especially eager to celebrate it with his teammates, and with his ailing roommates – there’s been talk of an injury curse on MSU this season, and his apartment might be a good place to start. He lives with cornerback Vayante Copeland (out for the season with a fractured vertebra) and running back Madre London (out indefinitely with a leg injury). \nAt some point, Watts-Jackson will catch up with his U-M friends as well, including James Ross and Royce Jenkins-Stone. They were 10 seconds and one routine play from beating MSU for the first time since they were freshmen. \n“Those guys are seniors,” Jackson said, “and this young fella just ruined it for them.” \nBut at Watts-Jackson’s home for the past couple days, it has been nothing but treatment and well wishes and, eventually, good news. He was even able to walk around on crutches a little bit Sunday night, and one of the nurses implored of him: “Make sure you tell the Michigan State fans that we treated you real nice up here.” 474 CONNECT 30 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1LGqPSv TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:31:50.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
