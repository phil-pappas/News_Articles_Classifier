The last time they won a match was Sept. 15 against Lopez. Coincidentally, the Lady Hawks take on Lopez on Saturday. \n“I’m really proud of the way they didn’t roll over,” Lady Hawks coach Jennifer Taliancich said of her team. “They are slowly gaining confidence and they haven’t lost hope, and they shouldn’t. We showed that today, and that’s good. The last time we faced (the Lady Chargers) they beat us 3-0, so I’m happy that we seem to be turning a corner.” \nLady Chargers coach Lisa Mares was not too happy with her squad. \n“I’m very disappointed because I just felt like (the Lady Hawks) were more ready than us to play,” Mares said. “The first game we did well, then we relaxed too much and sort of took things for granted. We can’t do that. \n“We are still a little immature and we don’t really have a vocal team leader on the court, and it showed today.” \nThe Lady Chargers were led by Bridget Himes, who had 12 kills and four blocks, and Sarah Sandoval, who finished with 17 kills and 20 digs. \nFor more on this story, visit RGVSports.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T07:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:37:47.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
