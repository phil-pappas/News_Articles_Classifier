(Mark Rogers/Lubbock Avalanche-Journal via AP) more > By BETSY BLANEY -   \nLUBBOCK, Texas (AP) - The bright spot in Iowa State’s 66-31 loss to Texas Tech on Saturday was freshman running back Mike Warren. \nHe finished with 245 yards on 23 carries, both career-highs. \nIt was his third straight game of more than 100 yards and he holds the single-season rushing record for a freshman after five games. \n“He had a monster game,” Cyclones coach Paul Rhoads said. “We thought we’d be able to run the football and did, over 300 yards, so now we’re over 200 yards three straight games, and if you can keep doing that, it’ll give your football team a chance.” \nPatrick Mahomes threw for 428 yards and five touchdowns, two to Jakeem Grant, to lead Texas Tech to its first Big 12 win. \nGrant had a career-high 166 yards on nine catches. He caught TD passes of 75 and 37 yards for Texas Tech (4-2, 1-2). It was Grant’s third 100-plus-yard game this season. \nDeAndre Washington had a receiving and a rushing TD, while Justin Stockton scored on a 54-yard rush. Texas Tech’s 776 total yards was a school record. \nThe Red Raiders intercepted Cyclones quarterback Sam Richardson three times - two by J.J. Gaines - and Texas Tech scored touchdowns off two of them. \nWarren said he had a lot of help from other Cyclones (2-3, 1-1). \n“I give all the credit to the O-line,” he said. “Those guys, they showed up real tough.” \nIowa State quarterback Sam Richardson completed 10 of 21 for 139 yards and three interceptions. He had three coming into the game. \nJoshua Thomas scored two rushing touchdowns for the Cyclones, each from a yard out. \nReceiver Allen Lazard said the loss shook the team. \n“I think everybody is just very frustrated and disappointed in themselves because they know that we could have played a lot better and that, I mean, we lost to a good team today, but we also didn’t play as well as our potential,” he said. “Sam just got pressured a lot today, and so he had to speed up his reads.” \nThe Cyclones play No. 2 TCU next week and No. 3 Baylor the following week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:08:12.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
