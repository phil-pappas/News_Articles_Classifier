Turpin did so in an explosive manner, catching four of his six receptions for touchdowns. The diminutive freshman entered the Texas game with eight catches for 107 yards and two scores to his name, and then set career bests in catches (six) and receiving yards (138). Turpin's four touchdown catches are the most by a freshman in one game in Big 12 history and tied for the most in one game by an FBS player this season. Among his catches were were touchdowns of 49 and 50 yards.\nHonorable mentions: RB Shock Linwood , Baylor (20 carries for 221 yards, two touchdowns in 63-35 win over Texas Tech); QB Mason Rudolph , Oklahoma State (34 of 55 for 437 yards, three touchdowns, one interception in 36-34 win over Kansas State); QB Kody Cook , Kansas State (started game at receiver before quarterback Joe Hubener was injured on opening drive; 10 of 16 for 122 yards, two touchdowns; 21 carries for 87 yards, one touchdown in 36-34 loss to Oklahoma State), WR Corey Coleman , Baylor (seven catches for 110 yards, three touchdowns in 63-35 win over Texas Tech); QB Trevone Boykin , TCU (20 of 35 for 332 yards, five touchdowns; seven carries for 52 yards in 50-7 win over Texas); QB Baker Mayfield , Oklahoma (14 of 25 for 320 yards, three touchdowns, one interception in 44-24 win over West Virginia).\nOn Twitter: @ByJoseRodriguez", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ByJoseRodriguez"], "published": "2015-10-05T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:48:50.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
