The two-assist game was the forward's second of his career and he is now ninth in program history with 16 career assists. Scouting FGCU: The Eagles come soaring into Hodges Stadium courtesy of two, shutout A-Sun victories last week over Jacksonville and Stetson. FGCU currently holds the nation's longest unbeaten streak at home against conference foes, going the last 28 games at the FGCU Soccer Complex without a loss. A key to their success this season has been the play of goalkeeper Nathan Ingham. The senior netminder is 4 th in the country with a save percentage of .889 and 8 th with a goals against average of 0.42. On offense, junior Dylan Sacramento leads the team with five goals including a two-goal performance against Jacksonville on Sept. 30. Playoffs?: Its early but a North Florida win or draw against FGCU coupled with a Stetson win at Jacksonville, clinches the five team field. The only team eliminated would be Jacksonville (0-3) who is seeking its first conference win this weekend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T13:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:57:06.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
