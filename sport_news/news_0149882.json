The decision was taken after the volunteers held a meeting which was attended by suspended party MPs Dr Dharamvira Gandhi and Harinder Khalsa here today. The volunteers said the front was aimed at exposing “corruption within the party”, besides highlighting the issues concerning the state that the party failed to take up so far. They said a 25-member state committee would be formed under the front. There will also be an 11-member state executive and a 101-member state council. Volunteers Sumeet Singh Bhullar, Surinder Singh Kahlon, Megh Raj Mittar, Jagdev Singh Grewal, Mukhtiar Singh Vaid, Vikramjit Singh Fatehpur, among others said the front would form its own policies, plan and mission, independent of AAP, because “AAP has abandoned its original mission”. “We will tour the state to highlight issues that AAP failed to address,” a volunteer said. On his likely expulsion from the party, Dr Gandhi said: “I don’t care even if they expel me. In every party there is a room for dissent. The Maharaja Patiala (Capt Amarinder) has spoken repeatedly against Rahul Gandhi, but he was not ousted. In contrast, AAP is deciding the fate of its elected members within two years of its inception.” Dr Gandhi sadi: “It took 90 years for the Congress to be called Indira’s party and 28 years for the BJP to be called Modi’s party, but within one-and-a-half years of its existence, AAP is Kejriwal’s party.” He said: “I am first a member of AAP then a doctor. The party’s identity has lent me popularity and vice-versa. I am not differentiable from AAP though I am unhappy with its policies. Khalsa rejects charges of anti-party work New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party’s Fatehgarh Sahib MP Harinder Singh Khalsa on Sunday said he would continue to raise his voice against any attempts to deviate from the core values of the organisation. He accused Sucha Singh Chhotepur and Sanjay Singh of wrecking AAP from within. Responding to a show-cause notice issued to him by the party, Khalsa sought to emphasise: “Internal democracy, swaraj and fight against corruption were the principles which brought the masses to this party. But, some persons led by Chhotepur and Sanjay Singh are hell bent to damage the Punjab unit. Chottepur and HS Shergill had levelled baseless charges against me. Nothing was done by the party establishment to rein them in,” he said in his letter. On the charges of having organised a parallel meeting on Rakhar Puniya, he said an event at Baba Bakala had deep religious significance for Sikhs. \"By associating the event for political gain, the Delhi establishment within the party has brought to the fore the manifest expediency of using the religious occasions for the political purpose,\" he added. — TNS Charges fly thick and fast The Aam Aadmi Volunteers Front aims at exposing corruption within the party, besides highlighting issues concerning the state that the party has failed to take up so far. We will have our own policies, plan and mission as the AAP leadership has abandoned its original mission. —Party volunteers It took 90 years for the Congress to be called Indira's party and 28 years for the BJP to be called Modi's party, but within one-and-a-half years, AAP is already Kejriwal's party...In Punjab, money for liquor is being distributed in party rallies. It is against this degeneration that AAP raised its voice. —Dr Dharamvira Gandhi, patiala mp", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:25:09.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
