It was just a lazy stupid hit on a WR being held up by another Charger defender. Addae should have simply finished the play with a proper tackle around the chest or waist. That hit cost the Chargers 1/2 yard penalty from their 1. That extra half yard was the difference in the Steelers RB scoring the winning TD. Just another example of a player not thinking or caring enough which ends up possibly costing his whole team a game.
