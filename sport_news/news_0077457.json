The Lions were seventh.\nBlancett had a wide smile and said there was nothing complicated about the “Omaha” plays when he had the talents of a 6-foot-2 jumping jack on the other end of the plays.\n“I looked at my matchups,” Blancett said. “Eli is a phenomenal receiver. He does have a 41-inch vertical leap. And he has those soft hands. We knew those plays were possibilities coming into the game.”\nAfter Lancaster scored on a 23-yard run by Shea Goss on its first possession in the first overtime, Gahanna coach Bruce Ward didn’t waste any time going for the tying score.\nBlancett dropped back and hit Whiteside for a 20-yard touchdown on the first play to tie the game.\n“We’re on the road, and there was no sense holding back,’’ Ward said. “With Eli, we knew we had an advantage out there.”\nGahanna got the ball first in the second overtime, and Blancett hit Whiteside for a 9-yard touchdown pass on the second play.\nWhiteside was low-key when talking about his big plays.\n“I just stemmed the corner and made plays on the ball,” he said. “From the start of overtime, (Blancett) looked at me and said, ‘We’re going to you.’ I said, ‘Let’s go get it.’”\nThe Lions have been on a tear since losing 28-21 to Westerville Central on opening night.\n“We had to win this game,’’ Whiteside said. “We were in this same situation in week 1 and lost the game. We weren’t going to let that happen again.”\nFor a while, though, it looked as if Lancaster had the fire to defeat Gahanna for the second time in five seasons. Lancaster took a 14-7 lead on an 11-yard run by Ryan Fitchpatrick with 5:38 left in the third quarter. That capped a 76-yard drive.\nThe Gales got a spark after defensive lineman Luke Sheridan sacked Blancett for a 9-yard loss on the first possession of the third quarter.\nRuns of 27 and 17 yards by Goss set up a 3-yard touchdown run by Fitchpatrick that made it 7-7 with 9:13 left in the third quarter.\n“We came out a little flat in the second half, but we didn’t panic,” Ward said.\nGahanna made it 14-14 on a 6-yard scramble by Blancett with 47 seconds left in the third quarter. The pivotal play on the drive was a 51-yard catch and run by Jestin Thompson that carried to the Lancaster 15.\nThe loss was difficult for Lancaster to take because it is driven to make the playoffs for the first time since 2009.\nVeteran coach Rob Carpenter was stoic.\n“It was a maturing experience,” he said. “I guarantee you we’re a lot better football team than we were coming in. Unfortunately, a lot of our guys have heavy hearts, but we don’t have time for that. We have a game on Thursday.”\nmznidar@dispatch.com\n@markznidar", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/markznidar"], "published": "2015-10-10T08:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:02:02.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
