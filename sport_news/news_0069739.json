I missed some throws, made some throws. There’s always room for improvement.\n“I’m trying to prepare like the starters. In practice I don’t get a whole lot of reps.”\nJones, 26, took extra satisfaction from being allowed to look for touchdown passes, rather than just handing off the ball.\n“It just instills a lot of confidence in me what the coaches think about me.\n\"I’m just so thankful they gave me a shot. They just didn’t hand the ball left and right off the bat. They let me get out there and throw and they trust me with the ball.”\nJones completed eight of 12 passes for 168 yards, his two touchdown passes going to wide receiver Martavis Bryant, who made his season debut after a substance abuse suspension and injury.\nBryant was quick to sing the praises of Jones.\n“Landry (wants) to take advantage of his opportunities, just like everyone else. Once he got a chance he didn’t look back.\n\"I’m proud of how he came out, proud of how everybody responded to him, having his back.”\nWith Roethlisberger doubtful for next week, Jones may get another chance to strut his stuff.\n“This team, it’s unbelievable,” he said of a franchise that has continued to win despite being decimated by injuries this season.\n“I’ve never seen anything like it, just the resiliency of the guys. It’s just next man up. Whoever’s next, they play hard and play the way they’re capable of.\n“Today we showed the world what type of team we are.”\n(Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina.
