Photo: Genevieve Ross, AP Image 11 of 11 Texans owner Bob McNair's donation to anti-LBGT group provokes ire 1 / 11 Back to Gallery Houston Texans owner Bob McNair is worth $3.3 billion .\nTaxpayers – many of them supporters of McNair's Texans — were kind enough (read: forced) to fund 61 percen t of McNair's stadium, completed in 2002.\nTotal public funding for Reliant Stadium, now NRG Stadium, was $261 million, compared to $185 million in private funds.\nNearly 4 percent of Texans identify as gay/lesbian, bisexual, or transgender, while 60 percent of all Americans support same-sex marriage.\nThe population in Houston — which, by the way, elected Annise Parker, the first openly gay mayor of a major American metropolis — is approximately 2.19 million, which would place over 87,000 openly LBGT individuals in the city.\nWhy do those numbers matter when it comes to the owner of a football team?\nBecause a $10,000 check bearing McNair's name was just cashed by Campaign for Houston, a group vehemently opposed to Houston's Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO).\nHERO opponents adamantly insist that outlawing discrimination based on gender identity could threaten the very existence, the very purity, of the city; particularly the sanctity of the public restroom .\nMcNair's donation is a green-tinged slap to the collective face of the rainbow assemblage of people who come to his stadium, who funded it with their own money, who helped a billionaire build a monolith dedicated to a game where men still fear to come as they are — because of individuals like McNair.\nThe HERO legislation protects \"people in employment, housing and business services on the basis of 15 different characteristics, including sex, race, color, ethnicity, national origin, age, familial status, marital status, military status, religion, disability, sexual orientation, genetic information, gender identity and pregnancy.\"\nDiscriminating against any person on the basis of the listed traits carries a $5,000 fine.\nIt is, first and foremost, a law designed to promote and protect equality and those who believe in it, men like former NFL player Chris Kluwe.\nKluwe has been one of, perhaps the most, outspoken athlete advocate of LBGT rights in recent years.\nA piece written by the former punter for Deadspin accused the Vikings of releasing him after eight seasons due to his vocal support of same-sex marriage.\nThe Vikings still deny this, but Kluwe never got another job in the NFL, though he's taken on a new one in the years since: full-time activist.\nIt appears McNair has walked directly into Kluwe's crosshairs, and that's a perilous place to be, even for a billionaire.\nKluwe penned a piece for The Cauldron railing against McNair for his donation to a group many believe is driven by hatred and fear.\nKluwe claws into McNair's ignorance on the situation and presents startling statistics associated with the LBGT community.\n\"Are you not aware that trans individuals are nine times more likely to try and kill themselves due to the odiously corrosive social views like the one you've just financially enabled?\" Kluwe writes. \"Have you no knowledge of the fact that LBGT youth are far more likely to experience harassment at school and home, leading to depression and ideations of self-harm — mostly due to the shortsighted wrongheadedness of privileged narcissists like yourself?\"\nKluwe continues at length employing a mix of garish language, facts and personal views.\nFormer Astro Lance Berkman, part of McNair's camp, has focused on \"the bathroom ordinance,\" expressing concern that the city law could open up women's restrooms, locker rooms and showers to \"troubled men.\"\nIn an ad for Campaign for Houston, Berkman refers warns against \"troubled men who claim to be women.\"\nThis despite the fact that the 36-page ordinance makes no mention of public restrooms, while supporters state that the edict would in no way protect predators.\nVoters, those like Kluwe and those like McNair, will take to the ballots Nov. 3 to decide on HERO's fate.\nMcNair has more money than the collective of people who will turn out to vote in favor of HERO, and he's got powerful allies with recognizable faces and lofty platforms.\nBut HERO proponents have individuals like Chris Kluwe and Annise Parker, and in this fight, that might make all the difference.\nnmoyle@express-news.net\nTwitter: @NRMoyle", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/30/8832546/3/920x920.jpg",
