The Chicago Cubs reportedly intend to leave the home run ball hit by Kyle Schwarber in the 7th inning of Tuesday’s series-clinching 6-4 win over the St. Louis Cardinals right where the slugger deposited it: On top of the new scoreboard at Wrigley Field.\nAdChoices A source with the team on Wednesday confirmed to the Chicago Tribune that the team will leave the ball where it landed until the conclusion of the Cubs’ participation in the postseason.\nBack from the Cubs Game. We let the @cubs & @kschwarb12 know that we found Schwarber's home run ball. #FlyTheW pic.twitter.com/uqbhucWW1k\n— Tom Comings (@Comings) October 14, 2015\nThe team did send an employee to inspect the ball so it could be confirmed that it was Schwarber’s moon shot home run ball, and an MLB postseason watermark verified its authenticity.\nThe Cubs also intend to place a plexiglass box around the ball to keep the ball safe from the elements and a security staffer will escort any person who travels to the top of the scoreboard until the ball is taken down.\nThe Cubs obviously know a thing or two about curses — to put it mildly — and the perceived toll such things can have upon an organization, whether it’s real or utter nonsense. Whatever the case, perhaps it’s not surprising the team is attempting to create some positive mojo by leaving Schwarber’s moon shot home run ball right where it landed … instead of waiting around and succumbing to the supposed curses of generations past.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Comings/status/654129945778720768", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/cubs/ct-kyle-schwarber-home-run-ball-20151013-story.html", "https://twitter.com/Cubs", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/FlyTheW?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/kschwarb12", "http://t.co/uqbhucWW1k", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:56:49.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
