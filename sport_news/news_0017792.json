The atmosphere at that primetime showdown should be as electric as it was against Michigan State. \n``I think we played really well. We played our butts off,'' safety Andre Hunt said. ``We have a lot of confidence now, playing against the No. 4 team in the country, thinking that down the road we can continue to play like we did tonight we will be able to win more games.’’ \nThere wasn’t a black-clad patron in the stands who wasn’t dreaming about what might be possible at halftime. \nAnd why not. \nWho could blame the Rutgers faithful as the Scarlet Knights took a 14-10 lead. \nIt’s what made the ending that much more difficult to stomach, as quarterback Chris Laviano absorbed a sack as he drove the Scarlet Knights into Michigan State territory in the final 30 seconds. He then spiked the ball, as he was instructed to do from the sideline, to stop the clock on what was fourth down, instead of launching a Hail Mary towards the end zone. \nBut there was enough here to bolster the program’s spirits. \n``There’s a lot of positives,'' safety Anthony Cioffi said .``It hurts, but we played a great game both sides of the ball. We came up short and now we have to move on from it now.’’ \nPerhaps it was only fitting that Leonte Carroo, reinstated after the simple assault under domestic violence charge against him was dropped last week, returned to show why he’s a potential first-round draft pick, catching a pair of first half touchdown passes, and another in the second half. \nHeroes emerged everywhere. \nLaviano avoided turning the ball over and threw for 208 yards, taking full advantage of Carroo’s return. \nThe defensive front put pressure on Spartans quarterback Connor Cook throughout, while containing their ground game. \nRunning back Paul James officially announced his return from a knee injury by racing 72 yards to jumpstart the offense, after three stalled drives to open the game. Rutgers upset bid falls just short on late Michigan State TD \nWilson, in his final game replacing Flood on the sideline, showed he wasn’t playing to lose, going for it on fourth-and-6 with 7:22 to play, with Laviano completing a pass to Justin Goodwin down to the Michigan State 26-yard-line. \nThen Robert Martin carried it for 15 yards to the nine, setting up a game-tying Kyle Federico field goal with 4:21 to play. \nBut ultimately, it was Cook who engineered a 77-yard drive for the game-winning touchdown, keeping the Spartans’ dream of winning a national championship alive. \nFor Rutgers, it was about getting the focus back on the football field, which is exactly what happened. \nAnd in the process, the Scarlet Knights gained respect throughout the Big Ten. \nStaff writer Stephen Edelson is an Asbury Park Press columnist: sedelson@gannettnj.com 29 CONNECT 18 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1RAw0En TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:15:25.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
