The annual fan event marks the start of a season with conference title aspirations, with four starters back and a McDonald's All American added to the fold. \nWith that in mind, here are five things to watch closely during Saturday's action: Overall health \nCoach Tom Crean himself brought this up last week at Big Ten media day: The Hoosiers are \"the product of injuries\" right now. \n\"We’ve got a long way to go to get our depth where it needs to be,\" Crean said. \nIt sounds like freshman center Thomas Bryant could be active for Hoosier Hysteria, if not 100 percent. Whether we'll see junior forward Collin Hartman, who has a rib injury, is unclear. James Blackmon Jr. said he's fully healthy from the torn meniscus he suffered in the summer. \nAre those the Hoosiers' only injury concerns right now?

(Photo: Michelle Pemberton / The Star) Insider: Flexibility makes Hoosiers' offense extra dangerous Thomas Bryant's early impact \nIf Bryant is healthy, then the most eyes will be on him. Indiana needed a player of his caliber in the post last season but couldn't develop one. Now, Crean can plug another McDonald's All American big man — this one known for his work rate and possessing underappreciated shooting range — into his lineup. \nHow will Bryant play off of Yogi Ferrell and Blackmon? How comfortable does he look in the post, and how much will Indiana send him there? Can he provide the versatility he teased at the Derby Festival Classic in the spring? \nSaturday is only a start, but it's a meaningful first look at IU's latest five-star center, if he's available. Indiana University-Hoosiers How Max Bielfeldt fits \nIndiana's other newcomer in the frontcourt deserves a mention as well. Bielfeldt was Michigan's sixth man of the year last season, and a repeat performance with IU this year would be a significant boost for the Hoosiers. \nBielfeldt adds rebounding prowess and veteran experience to a post rotation badly needing it. How quickly does he fit into IU's rotation, and how much impact can he have?

(Photo: Michelle Pemberton / The Star) Improvement from Troy Williams \nThis might wind up the storyline of the nonconference season. Williams is Indiana's best NBA prospect, one a lot of people expect to be ready to leave for the draft after his junior season. \nThat, however, would require Williams to refine his jumper, improve defensively and stay consistent over the whole season. Williams might already be Indiana's best rebounder, pound for pound, and he'll probably be featured on the ball even more this season. \nWhatever Williams' junior season holds, we'll start to find out Saturday.

Indiana hosted Purdue at Assembly Hall on Thursday, February 19, 2015. (Photo: Mike Fender / The Star) Fan reaction \nHoosier Hysteria often serves as an early barometer of the excitement and expectations for IU basketball. Eric Gordon's Assembly Hall debut came in front of a packed arena. Tom Crean's 2012-13 team, ranked preseason No. 1 overall, drew a similar crowd, with similar fervor. \nIndiana's offseason has endured negative headlines and player dismissals, but the Hoosiers now greet a winter in which they've been tapped to compete near — or even perhaps at — the top of the Big Ten. There's enough talent in town already to make Crean's team a near-consensus top-15 squad. Growth in players like Bryant and Williams will determine how much higher the ceiling rises. \nHave fans embraced that? The size and energy of Saturday's crowd might tell us. \nFollow Star reporter Zach Osterman on Twitter: @ZachOsterman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:37:52.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
