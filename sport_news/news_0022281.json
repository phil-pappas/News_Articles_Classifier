(AP) -- Toews On Ice gave up the lead approaching the half-mile pole and then rallied to win the $70,000 Speakeasy Stakes for 2-year-olds at Santa Anita on Sunday.\nRidden by Victor Espinoza, Toews On Ice ran six furlongs in 1:09.74 and paid $3.40, $2.20 and $2.10 as the 3-5 favorite. The colt is named for Jonathan Toews , captain of the Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks . He is trained by Bob Baffert and co-owned by Mike Pegram, a friend of Hawks coach Joel Quenneville.\nStreet Vision returned $2.80 and $2.10, while Blameitonthelaw was another 3 3/4 lengths back in third and paid $2.10 to show.\nEspinoza replaced Toews On Ice's regular rider Martin Garcia, who rode Pretty N Cool to victory in the Grade 2 Matron Stakes at Belmont Park in New York. Baffert also trains Pretty N Cool.\n''I had a good outside post and he broke in front,'' said Espinoza, who drove to the lead leaving the quarter pole. ''He did things easily. He's still learning and some horses need one or two races to really focus and he's one of those.''\nThe victory, worth $42,900, increased Toews On Ice's career earnings to $115,200, with two wins in four starts.\n''He's still a little green, still wanting to run on his left lead,'' said Jim Barnes, Baffert's assistant, ''but he's moving forward and I'm sure we have big things to come.''\nSports & Recreation Jonathan Toews Victor Espinoza Bob Baffert Martin Garcia   195/73864   154/1704   266/4545  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:09:53.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
