Greg Abbott jinxes Astros on Twitter, promptly deletes post, Internet loses mind 1 / 11 Back to Gallery The Astros entered Monday's game against the Royals up 2-1 and needing just one win to move onto the American League Championship Series.\nHouston got off to an auspicious start, leading Kansas City 6-2 entering the top of the 8th.\nThen, Governor Greg Abbott decided to pop the Twitter champagne too early, promptly jinxing the 'Stros:\n\"Congrats to the @astros on advancing to the ALCS! Hoping for an all-Texas #ALCS. Looking at you @Rangers.\"\nGov. Abbott deleted the tweet, but his hubris had already struck the Astros. Kansas City scored five runs in the 8th to take a 7-6 lead, then tacked on two more in the 9th in a 9-6 win.\nThe tweet was deleted, and Gov. Abbott spoke out from his personal account, @GregAbbott_TX:\nHey @Astros fans. Unfollow --> @GovAbbott. Follow the REAL Greg Abbott right here. No predictions. Just support.\nThe original tweet came from @GovAbbott, which is for \"official news from the Office of Texas Governor Greg Abbott,\" and is run by staffers.\nTo save face, Abbott threw his office's official account under the bus without any hesitation â€” that's the power of social media in 2015.\nWith the series now tied 2-2, the Astros and Royals will play an elimination game Wednesday night.\nTip of the cap to Cliff Saunders (@cliffsaunders), who captured a screenshot of Gov. Abbot's tweet.\nClick through the slides above to see some of social media's best reactions to the jinxed tweet.\nnrmoyle@express-news.net\nTwitter: @NRmoyle", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/37/8779774/4/920x920.png", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/41/8779853/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/33/8779467/4/920x920.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/41/8779847/4/920x920.png", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/37/8779752/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/40/8779812/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/41/8779842/4/920x920.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/41/8779851/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/41/8779847/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/33/8779467/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/37/8779752/4/920x920.png", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/41/8779853/4/920x920.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/41/8779855/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/37/8779762/4/920x920.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/41/8779851/4/920x920.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/41/8779855/4/920x920.png", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/37/8779762/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/41/8779842/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/37/8779774/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/37/40/8779812/4/920x920.png"], "published": "2015-10-13T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:51:09.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
