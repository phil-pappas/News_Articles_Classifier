Khattar said the committees would comprise sarpanches, panches, ex-sarpanches and retired government officers who would scrutinise the bills. He made it clear he would not tolerate corruption at any cost and urged the people to support him in his endeavour so that entire amount released by the government was spent on welfare works. “Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi said out of Rs 1 released by the government, only 15 paisa reached people. If the entire amount is spent judiciously, there will be manifold increase in development,” the CM said. With the mill’s foundation stone laid, 25-year-old demand has been fulfilled. The Chief Minister said Rs 270 crore would be spent on the mill to double its crushing capacity. He suggested farmers to not only bank on traditional crops and adopt alternative farming such as horticulture, floriculture, poultry farming, fish farming and beekeeping to increase their income. On the demands raised by Panipat (Rural) MLA Mahipal Dhanda, Khattar announced development projects worth Rs60 crore. The projects included construction of roads, setting up of a PHC in Khotpura, a polyclinic for the cattle, rejuvenation of historical place Kala Amb and construction of a museum. He announced Rs10 crore for development projects for the Panipat (Rural) Assembly constituency and Rs5 crore each for the remaining three Assembly constituencies in the district.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:02:47.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
