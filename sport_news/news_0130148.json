That is the message the players have had for a decade.\" \nThe decision to recall captain John Terry backfired and fellow center back Gary Cahill was similarly susceptible in defense as Mourinho endured only his third league loss at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea manager. \nWillian had curled in a free kick after 10 minutes to put the champions in front but Steven Davis leveled before halftime. Sadio Mane and Graziano Pelle netted in the second half to give Southampton its first win at Chelsea since 2002. \nChelsea is only four points above the relegation zone and 10 points behind fledgling leader Manchester City. Its latest setback overshadowed Sergio Aguero's five-goal performance as City trashed Newcastle 6-1. \nCity dominant performance in the second half against Newcastle provided a reminder of the team's title credentials after back-to-back Premier League losses and a Champions League setback. \nAleksandar Mitrovic headed Newcastle in front in the 18th minute and it took Aguero until three minutes before halftime to equalize. \nBut in a 13-minute spell at the start of the second half, Aguero added another four goals, while Kevin de Bruyne also got in on the scoring act for the leaders. \nAguero had only scored three goals in the first two months of the season before Saturday and his tally might be have greater had he not been taken off with around 25 minutes remaining. \n\"In other games he was maybe having a lot of chances but not scoring,\" City manager Manuel Pellegrini told the BBC. \"But today he returned to his normal amount of chances he creates but this time he scored. \n\"He was not upset about going off. He was having treatment at half time and it was a risk for him to finish the whole game.\" \nNewcastle is last in the standings, still without a win after eight games. Northeast rival Sunderland moved ahead on goal difference with a 2-2 draw against West Ham. Sunderland threw away a 2-0 lead to leave Dick Advocaat still searching for his first victory over the campaign. \nIt's similarly bleak for Aston Villa, which is a point further ahead with just one win to its name so far. Marko Arnautovic gave Stoke a 1-0 victory at Villa Park. \nThere were victories for two of the surprise packages of the early season: Crystal Palace and Leicester. \nLeicester quickly bounced back from its first loss of the season last weekend by winning 2-1 at Norwich. Jamie Vardy scored a seventh goal in eight league games for Leicester. \nYohan Cabaye set up Yannick Bolasie's header and then scored from the penalty spot as Palace beat West Bromwich Albion 2-0 to move ahead of Leicester into third place on goal difference. \nA meeting between promoted clubs Bournemouth and Watford ended in a 1-1 stalemate. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T22:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T00:17:11.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
