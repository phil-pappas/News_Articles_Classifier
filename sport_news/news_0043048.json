With the Warriors being the No. 1 ranked 3A team the miscalculations were too much to recover from. Washington scored four runs in each of the third and fourth innings to easily take the win. “You can’t make errors against good teams. We didn’t show up for two innings. They scored eight runs in those two innings. You can’t do that against a good team like Washington,” coach Bryan Herring said. Chandler scored one run in the third and one in the fifth. Herring said that pitcher Neleigh Herring was still on point after throwing a 14-strikeout game against Kansas in their State opener Thursday. The Warriors just did a good job scouting her and were able to get the hits they needed. \"You can’t take anything away from them at all,” coach Herring said. “They hit the pitches that she was throwing and they were hitting them where she was putting them.” With all but one player being an underclassman, coach Herring knows he will have a good group of athletes to make another run next year though. “They’ve set a precedent for our program and we’ve completely turned that thing around,” he said. “Being where we’re at and being as young as we are, having the core group of this nucleus of kids coming back next year.” The one loss will be a big one though, in team captain Kelsie Cowden. “She’s a quality, quality kid, great leader,” he said. “I can’t say enough about Kelsie Cowden. She’s one of those kids that you want to have on your ball club.” The Lady Lions finished the season 32-10.
