SUU opted to save their top runners for the Pre-Nationals meet in Louisville next weekend, and instead of racing did a morning practice on the course that will be the spot of the Big Sky Conference championship later this month. \n“I was a little bit disappointed,” Storie said of the runners sitting out. “I love competition, that’s what I thrive off of. I don’t really pay much attention to times, but when someone is out there pushing me that’s what I pay attention to the most. I expected a little more competition from today, like last year when I had to really fight for a second place finish. But I’m always happy with a win, too.” \nOn the men’s side Utah Valley’s Logan Petty took home first place, with SUU true freshman Koy Moore close behind in second. With the top racers not competing, it gave the T-Birds’ younger runners, like Moore, a chance to compete. \n“They are like horses,” SUU head coach Eric Houle said. “If you race them too much, they are just going to want to sit in a stable and just eat hay. So you got to pick your battles. … So what I get do is work the athletes out -- the ones that are going to go out Louisville — and then I give the red shirts, the young people that are trying to breakthrough an opportunity to race.” \nThe red rocks and changing leaves on the surrounding Cedar mountain ranges provided a picturesque backdrop to the competition. It’s a different course than what has been used in year’s past and one that has been months in the making. \nLast spring, SUU began mapping out the course, trying to make it not only a great course for the runners, but also one that would be spectator friendly. From the perspective Houle considered Saturday a success. \n“Our hope is it’s a springboard to the very best conference championship ever in the Big Sky,” he said. “I’ve been in three of them, and I think it will be the best to date, and that’s my hope.” \nOne thing is for sure, when the rest of the conference comes to Cedar on Oct. 31, SUU's top runners will be joining them on the course. \nMen 6K top finishers \nLogan Petty (Utah Valley) 19:20.90, Koy Moore (Southern Utah) 19:29.10, Skylar Riggs (Unattached-SUU) 19:45.40, KC Hunsinker (Idaho State) 19:53.00, Ty James (Idaho State), 19:56.70 \nMen team finishes \n1.
