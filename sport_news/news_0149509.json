Why doesn't the church sell off this treasure and all of its other holdings to help the poor and dispossessed? The pope is a total hypocrite. He should read his Bible.

Then come, follow me.\"\nWarren Wylie\nAloha", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:17:59.198+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
