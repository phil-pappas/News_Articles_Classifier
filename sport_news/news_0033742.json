TERRILL, AP FILE PHOTO Related article » In light of a violent assault outside of Dodger Stadium on Friday night, Los Angeles police will have an increased presence at today’s decisive Dodgers playoff game.\nPolice say the incident, which left one man in critical condition and triggered memories of the highly publicized 2011 assault of Bryan Stow, is “an anomaly,” not a dangerous trend. LAPD Lt. John Jenal said Wednesday it was the first physical altercation that required hospitalization since Stow was assaulted on Opening Day 2011.\nThe LAPD would not disclose specific plans for deployment increases but reiterated Wednesday that the department was confident Dodger Stadium would be “a family-friendly environment” when it hosts the New York Mets in Game 5 of the National League Division Series.\n“The department is looking at this very seriously,” Jenal said. “We don’t want any kind of reputation to start up that Dodger Stadium is an unsafe place to go.”\n“Safety in this city is my top priority, and the attack last Friday night was a tragedy that must not be repeated,” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti added in a statement. “The LAPD meets regularly with the Dodgers to ensure that games are safe for the community and visitors – particularly for high-profile games. In light of Friday’s terrible incident, we have heightened security for all home games with uniformed LAPD officers.”\nFriday’s assault called that safety into question for the second time in five years after a man – believed to be a Mets fan – was attacked by two assailants in Lot L around 10:30 p.m.\nThe victim has not been identified or questioned by the LAPD, though the department is searching for a mother and son believed to be the perpetrators.\nThe incident bore a striking resemblance to the savage beating of Stow, the Giants fan who was left with permanent brain damage. Stow’s civil case alleged that the assault would have been preventable if the Dodgers had an increased stadium security presence.\nA jury ruled in favor of Stow in July 2014 and ordered the Dodgers, ruled negligent in the case, to pay $13.9 million.\n“After that incident,” Jenal said, “it definitely was time for reflection and getting better.”\nThe LAPD said Wednesday that changes put in place since Stow’s 2011 assault, along with further collaboration with the Dodgers security staff, have improved the stadium’s security. In the past five years, the stadium has averaged slightly more than 3.5 million fans per season.\nThe Dodgers had no comment Wednesday.\nBeginning this season, the department instituted a zero-tolerance crackdown on tailgating outside of Dodger Stadium, which Jenal said has been “strictly enforced” and led to fewer arrests.\nThe LAPD also has dedicated more bicycle officers and enforcement to the parking lot areas.\nThe parking lot presents the stadium’s most pressing security issues as both Friday’s assault and the 2011 incident took place outside of the stadium.\nIn light of both incidents, the LAPD said it will review its strategic plans for security in those areas and increase its presence where necessary. But, ultimately, the stadium’s multitiered parking lot design presents “a bit of a challenge.”\n“Since Bryan Stow, we have enhanced the security at Dodger Stadium significantly,” LAPD Chief Charlie Beck told reporters Tuesday.\n“But it’s a big facility, and you can’t be everywhere all the time,” he said.\nAlong with Friday’s assault, the two games at Dodger Stadium last weekend produced four nonviolent arrests, which Jenal says is “very minimal.”\nContact the writer: rkartje@ocregister.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw8xeu-b88541170z.120151014221608000go7cjg5v.40.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw8xeu-b88541170z.120151014221608000go7cjg5v.40.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:26:20.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
