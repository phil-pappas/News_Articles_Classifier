They proved a few, as well. \nThey reaffirmed their status as an elite team. They restored belief and their two-game lead in the NFC West. They made the strongest case possible that a home loss in Week 4 was the anomaly, and not a sign of impending danger. \nAfter a 42-17 trouncing of the Lions at Ford Field, these Cardinals are also proving to be better on the road than they are at home. \n“Ever since coach (Bruce Arians) has been here, he always preaches to us that good teams don’t lose twice (in a row),” Cardinals cornerback Patrick Peterson said. “And we feel like we’re a good team. And this was great (test) for us to come out here and see what type of team we have after losing a home game last week.” Cardinals collect 6 turnovers in win over Detroit Lions \nAfterward, the happy locker room was teeming with stars, enough to qualify as a constellation. The defense knocked out its second quarterback in as many road games (Jay Cutler, injury; Matthew Stafford, multiple interceptions). The offense scored 28 points in the second quarter and had two running backs crack off runs of 40 or more yards. They made the home crowd turn on their favorite team. \nAlmost lost in the demolition of Detroit was possibly the most important point of all: Carson Palmer is reliable, accurate and possibly the hungriest quarterback in football. \n“When Carson is healthy … I think he’s the best in the business,” Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald said. \nYet Palmer had misfired twice on the final drive against the Rams, including a terrible pass on fourth down that sealed the defeat. Some wondered if that spoke to Palmer’s ceiling as a quarterback, a veteran who has never won a playoff game in his lengthy career. Recap: Cardinals at Lions updates and analysis \nHe had flinched under pressure, losing a game for the first time since 2013. And if you know how much Palmer cares about this team and this opportunity, you understand how much that game hurt him inside. \nAgainst the Lions, Palmer responded like a great quarterback. He completed 11 of 14 passes, a small sample size that belied his impact on the game. He threw a gorgeous pass to Darren Fells to tie the game early in the second quarter. Ditto on his touchdown pass to John Brown, prompting one of the worst choreographed end-zone dances on record. \nMeanwhile, his third touchdown pass looked like a reward for a great catch Fitzgerald had made on the previous play, speaking to the newfound connection between the two. Arians said his quarterback was “spot on” with everything. And while Palmer rarely shows any emotion, his bounce-back effort illustrates just how much he yearns to be the leader of a great team, to win something that matters. \nHe admitted as much after the game. Cardinals XTRA app: Get the latest news, analysis, scores, more \n“I finally can get past last week, just 30 minutes ago, 45 minutes ago,” Palmer said. “That one lingered for a long time. It was a division game. More importantly, having a home game in front of our fans and the support we had. I just felt like I let everybody in that stadium down – the guys in the huddle, the guys on the sideline, every butt in those seats that was wearing red. \n“So it took like an extra week. Normally, you get past a loss, and you have to get past a loss. But that one lingered, and we needed to do what we did today to get past that one.” \nThe prettiest pass Palmer threw against the Lions didn’t result in a touchdown. It came out of his own end zone, when he lofted a 49-yard rainbow that hit Brown in stride. Two plays later, the Cardinals broke open the game, proving another point: \nOnly really good teams believe they can score from their own 1-yard line. The Cardinals covered 99 yards in five plays and 140 seconds. It was explosive offense at its finest. It prompted another shower of boos from a crowd that began to head for the exits after the first half. Detroit Lions couldn't go 0-16 again, could they? \n“I don’t blame them,” Lions coach Jim Caldwell said. “You play poorly like that, obviously, that’s poor play, period. Let’s face the facts.” \nArians believed his team caught a break. He thought the Lions looked tired after playing in the Pacific Northwest on Monday night and couldn’t fight back once the game got sideways. It was a generous gesture from a coach that normally gives no quarter. \nStill, the Cardinals have played two road games, winning both by 25 points. Only six teams in history have scored more points through five games. Two of them won championships. One of them was Kurt Warner’s Rams. That’s pretty good company. \nBut the Cardinals aren’t looking to make history. On this day, they were looking to atone for a pedestrian performance. Their response tells you something about the character of this team. Arizona Cardinals' Calais Campbell dominant this season \n“We dropped a NFC game last week, so it was real important for us to come out today and get back on track,” Cardinals safety Tyrann Mathieu said. “Obviously with Detroit being an NFC opponent, we didn’t want this game to come back and affect us later on in the year. Last week, we felt as a defense we lost that game for our offense.” \nThat’s also how Palmer felt, but all the demons have been exorcised. The Cardinals were back to high-class problems on Sunday, like chewing out receivers for excessive celebration and wondering when to get the backup quarterback in the game. \nFor Palmer, that meant taking a seat with 11:51 remaining, well after he had proven his point. \nReach Bickley at dan.bickley@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8253.
