(Photo by Steve Dykes/Getty Images) In its never ending quest to be the first thing everyone on the planet talks about from the moment they rise to the instant they fall asleep the NFL put a game in London (the one in England, NOT one of the seven cities named London in the U.S.) that started at 6:30 in the morning Dan Diego time. In that game the Dolphins lost again, this time to the Jets to fall to 1-3. Miami was a trendy preseason playoffs pick (me included) but through four games looks utterly lost. Lawsuit Battles SDG&Eâ€™s Plan to Charge for Wildfires That game is why I'm terrified about the Chargers game at the Q against the Browns. I don't want to realize the Chargers are the Dolphins; a team that should be really good but for some inexplicable reasons is not. The Chargers will have a patchwork offensive line and question marks in the secondary but they still have more than enough talent to beat the Browns. If they don't ... well I don't even want to contemplate that. Which brings us to this week's players to watch: Car Abandoned Near Deadly Hit-and-Run Chris Hairston, LT He's in for King Dunlap, who is inactive with a concussion. Left guard Orlando Franklin and center Chris Watt are also inactive, replaced by Kenny Wiggins and Trevor Robinson. Hairston has played mostly guard with the Chargers but the bulk of his NFL starts were at tackle in Buffalo so this is not uncharted territory. The makeshift starting line(up) will have to keep Philip Rivers upright a lot better than it has in 2015. Rivers has been sacked 10 times in three games. Hairston being able to keep Rivers clean from the left side will determine how often Philip picks himself up off the ground against Cleveland. Have the Rams Cut the Chargers Out of L.A.? Melvin Ingram, OLB The Chargers need to generate a pass rush, plain and simple. They have one sack for the entire season. Ingram is in the final year of his rookie contract so if he wants the Bolts to pick up his 5th year option he's going to have to start producing. Ingram has been good in run support but needs to finish at the quarterback. If there was a stat for times nearly sacking the QB he'd be in the NFL's top-5. Ingram should be able to finally get in the sack column against Josh McCown and Johnny Manziel. 1 Wounded in Shooting Outside Bar Branden Oliver, RB I know Melvin Gordon and Danny Woodhead will get the bulk of the carries but Cleveland is giving up 158 yards a game on the ground this year. If ever there was a time to run it 45 times, this would be it. By the time Oliver is in the Browns defense should be softened up enough for him to turn in one of his signature big plays. One Dead in Poway Rollover Derek's Prediction This is a game the Chargers must have. It's a winnable game in front of a Monday Nighter against the Steelers (still dangerous without Roethlisberger) and Packers (Aaron Rodgers does not lose at Lambeau). That motivation alone should be enough to get them a win. The Bolts use a run-heavy attack that makes Rivers even more effective to dominate time of possession and get back to .500.
