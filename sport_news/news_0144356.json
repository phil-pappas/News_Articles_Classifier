It's not serious, but a source said he wouldn't have been able to play tomorrow against the Cowboys if needed. However, Fletcher was a healthy scratch in Week 3 against the Jaguars after falling behind cornerback Justin Coleman on the depth chart.\nQuarterbacks Ben Roethlisberger and Tyrod Taylor were 8 of 10 for 129 yards and one touchdown when targeting Fletcher, who was also flagged once for pass interference.\nFletcher signed a one-year contract this offseason that included a $300,000 signing bonus. The deal could have been worth up to $2.5 million if Fletcher reached all of his playing-time incentives.\nIt's unclear right now whether Fletcher's release was more about the injury or his performance. The Patriots' decision whether or not to re-sign him in a week or two will determine that.\nThe Patriots promoted special teamer Brandon King from the practice squad to take Fletcher's spot on the 53-man roster.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:59:11.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
