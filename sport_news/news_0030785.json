It is no coincidence anyone around him performs.\" \nCaptain Jagielka is the only Toffees defender to play every minute of every match this season. \nHe, too, has been pleased with way the replacements have slotted in during an injury crisis. \n\"We knew with injuries it would be a test for the lads and they tried their hardest,\" he told evertontv. \n\"It is all part of their learning curve and fantastic for them. \n\"It is also great for Ramiro getting this game time and learning the English game.\" \nFunes Mori was signed from Argentinian club River Plate late in the transfer window for Â£9.5million but his display in the derby showed his quality. \n\"It has the same intensity as the Superclasico (River Plate v Boca Juniors) back home,\" he said. \n\"The fans make it very intense and when they scream you know you are in a derby. \n\"In Argentina, I played around six or seven derbies so for me I felt normal and it was good. \n\"Premier League football is very physical and the intensity of the game is high. \n\"I have to keep adapting to the Premier League, but I really like it and I'm enjoying my moment and I want to keep playing.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:49:51.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
