The junior shot a 3-over par 75, ahead of Washington’s Allison Kinsinger (81) in windy conditions at Illinois State University’s Weibring Golf Club. “I’m so proud. To be honest, I was a little concerned,” Nesselroad said. “The conditions were very tough and I was a little concerned 75 wasn’t going to get the job done. I felt a little bit of pressure going into the las two holes because I knew I had to finish strong in order for my team to do well and I did.” The Silver Streaks scored an 86-over par 356 for first place, advancing to the state tournament which takes place this weekend at Hickory Point Golf Club in Decatur. “What can I say about it? It’s remarkable,” Galesburg coach Brad Gross said of Nesselroad’s performance. “She battled the wind to shoot 3-over par and it was unbelievable. It was fun to watch. She had a great day.” Rylee Chockley shot a 91 and Kirsten Osborn and Alexis Bush each finished with 95s for Galesburg. “I couldn’t be happier right now. I got second freshman and sophomore year at sectional and it feels great to get a win,” Nesselroad said. “I’m very happy and proud of the girls, as well.” “The girls prevailed today. It wasn’t easy,” Gross said. “It was a challenge all around. You can tell by the scores. The girls did what needed to be done and came out on top.” O’Fallon and Normal tied for second with 363s Monday and also qualified for state.
