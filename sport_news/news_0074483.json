India are 1-2 down in the five-match rubber and need to win today to be in with a chance of upstaging the rampaging Proteas in the fifth and final match scheduled in Mumbai on Sunday.\nAlso Read:  Amit Mishra is available for the Chennai match: Harbhajan Singh \n\n\nHarbhajan Singh \n\"Obviously, we are in a tricky situation. We have to win tomorrow to be in the series. We have got the team which can turn things around. I want to say one thing that the team will be going all out to win the game tomorrow and from there onwards, we will hopefully put up another good performance. Things can be different in one week's time,\" Harbhajan told reporters in the pre-match press conference here.\n\"No bowler is (so) perfect that he can keep on bowling at one length and one line. We need to be a little more smart than what we have seen in the last three games,\" he said. Harbhajan said the team's batsmen are also quite capable of turning the tide.\nAlso Read:  4th ODI: We have a good chance to win series today, says Dale Steyn \nAttacking approach \nThe senior tweaker said he, along with the other Indian bowlers, will look to be attacking in their approach even if it means conceding a few runs. \"I have come here with one purpose only to win games for India no matter what situation I am bowling. Looking to take wickets and to contain the batsmen is by getting them out. With our spinners, we are looking to put pressure on them and not to give them easy singles if they are looking to go over the top, that is fine by us,\" Harbhajan said.\n\n\nIndia players indulge in a football session during practice at MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai yesterday. Pic/PTI \n\"We want to take wickets as spinning unit. Whoever is bowling at any point of time, we want to attack. In that process you will go for boundaries here and there. At the same time, if you pick up a wicket you can control the game,\" he added. Harbhajan praised fellow spinners Amit Mishra and Axar Patel and said the duo adds variety to the attack.\n\"It is nice to have lot of variety in the team. All the spinners are doing a different role. Amit has been playing for many years and brings a lot of experience on the table. Axar is doing really well. He played the game in Indore and picked up two crucial wickets. It is nice to be bowling along with these guys,\" he said.\nHarbhjan lavished praise on skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who has drawn criticism owing to India's lacklustre show in the series. \"You go with your plans to the captain and he has lot of options. \"Dhoni has been a brilliant captain for India. We won a brilliant game in Indore and in Rajkot, we did not play as well. Hopefully things will change from tomorrow,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:45:57.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
