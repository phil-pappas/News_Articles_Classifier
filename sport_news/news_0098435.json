(AP) - The Seabrook police officer caught on video slamming a suspect into a wall in 2009 has pleaded guilty to assault.\nWMUR-TV reports ( http://bit.ly/1OiuWX9 ) Mark Richardson pleaded guilty Monday to a charge of simple assault by a police officer. A jury was unable to reach a verdict during trial earlier this year so a judge declared a mistrial.\nRichardson was charged with assault after video surfaced showing him pushing Michael Bergeron into a wall at the Seabrook Police Station.\nBergeron had been charged with driving while intoxicated and possession of drugs. Other officers said Bergeron was struggling and uncooperative when Richardson forced him into the wall.\nUnder the agreement reached with prosecutors, Richardson could serve up to 21 days in jail.\nThree other officers were disciplined following the incident.\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1OiuWX9"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:44:52.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
