Williams, the acting U.S. Attorney for Oregon, told The Oregonian/OregonLive.\nThe 26-year-old gunman, who reportedly asked his victims to state their religion before opening fire on them, got into a firefight with two members of the Roseburg police department. But not before he shot and killed nine and wounded nine others.\nBilly J. Williams, the acting U.S. attorney for Oregon Dave Killen/The Oregonian Williams said the first-blush impression of investigators is that Mercer acted alone rather than as part of an organized hate group.\n\"They're still looking at the possibility of anybody else involved,\" Williams said. \"But right now, the indication is that he acted alone.\"\nFederal agents continue to support the Douglas County Sheriff's Office investigation to establish that Mercer acted without outside help and to learn what ideology – if any – might have motivated the slayings before the shootout that left him dead.\nMark Graves | The Oregonian/OregonLive Computers, phones and other electronic data seized from Mercer, his car or apartment were expected to be sent to the FBI's Northwest Regional Computer Forensics Laboratory in Northeast Portland, law enforcement sources told The Oregonian/OregonLive.\nExperts there will mine the drives to learn what Mercer was writing, and to whom, in hopes of learning what might have inspired the attack or whether he had been radicalized by any hate groups, according to sources familiar with the process.\nMercer reportedly wrote a manifesto of sorts that detailed his anger and depression, according to CBS News.\nHe came to campus with six weapons, including five handguns and a military-style rifle that law enforcement officials described as a variation of the AR-15.\n-- Bryan Denson\nbdenson@oregonian.com\n503-294-7614; @Bryan_Denson", "external_links": ["http://www.cbsnews.com/news/oregon-shooting-umpqua-community-college-chris-harper-mercer-investigation/", "https://twitter.com/Bryan_Denson"], "published": "2015-10-03T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:42:14.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
