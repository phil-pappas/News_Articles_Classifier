That is what the Taft varsity football team is getting this week as they enter the stretch run of the season. “It feels good,” said Taft coach George Falgout. “Our kids are happy and excited.” Even though they have a break this week, the Wildcats are starting to get ready for their next opponent which will be against the Wasco Tigers next week in Wasco. According to Falgout, the coaches have already started to look at film. In the meantime, Falgout says the team has been hitting the weight room hard. “We’ve been fine tuning things,” said Falgout. Following the break, Taft will only have three games left in the regular season-next week in Wasco and then a pair of home games against Bakersfield Christian and Robert F. Kennedy. Despite only a few games left, Falgout says the team is only focused on the next game they play. “We’re firm believers at one game at a time,” he said. “What happens in the past stays in the past.” The break also comes at a good time for the team with this week being Oildorado in Taft. “It could be a distraction,” said Falgout. “Our kids have been handling Oildorado really good. To try to hold them back from the fun would not be right.” Taft got a piece of good news this week with senior quarterback Tevin Howell being cleared to return and defensive tackle Salofi Maino also being cleared to play. Other than Howell Falgout says the team is healthy.
