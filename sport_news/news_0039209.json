(AP) - Johnny Pena scored on a 7-yard run with 57 seconds remaining and Brown beat Princeton 38-31 on Saturday. \nPena’s score came on a five-play, 42-yard drive after Princeton’s Chad Kanoff was hit while trying to throw and his pass was intercepted by Will Twyman. \nPrinceton (4-1, 1-1 Ivy) rallied from a 21-7 deficit to tie it twice, the final time at 31-all with 10 minutes left on Kanoff’s 10-yard score to Scott Carpenter. \nBrown never trailed, taking the lead on the game’s first play when Alexander Jette returned the kickoff 99 yards. \nThe game matched Princeton’s league-leading rushing offense against the Ivy’s best passing offense of Brown (3-2, 1-1). The teams combined for 924 yards, though Princeton led with 373 yards passing and Brown with 192 rushing. \nBrown snapped Princeton’s four-game winning streak and beat the Tigers for the first time in four games. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:07:35.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
