His idea of bolstering the standing of lower- and middle-class Americans is pretty much to call them losers for not being billionaires.\nThere's former Arkansas Gov. Huckabee, a Southern Baptist minister who once argued that Jesus would oppose the minimum wage. Really.\nAdvertisement And Fiorina practically ran HP into the ground under her leadership, tanking its stock and axing hundreds of workers after her catastrophic acquisition of Compaq. Yet she improbably runs on her self-proclaimed business acumen.\nThen there's the struggling former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whose motto seems to be \"just like my brother, only worse,\" and who wants to — get this — cut taxes on the rich. Again.\nOf course, he's not unique in backing what U.S. News & World Report described as the GOP's \"unwavering fealty to trickle-down economics,\" the theory that tax cuts for the rich and deregulation of businesses encourages the wealthy to invest and create more jobs.\nEvery Republican candidate clings to what critics originally called \"voodoo economics\" back when Ronald Reagan advocated it, and it since has been discredited by every serious economist. Research released this summer by the International Monetary Fund confirmed that instead of encouraging \"job creators,\" trickle-down economics only widens the income disparity between rich and poor and actually slows economic growth.\nOn the other hand, when poor people make more money, the economy as a whole grows, according to research covering 159 countries. It makes sense: When rich people have more money, they hoard it and count their dividends; when poor people have more money, they spend it on goods and services. It's why Henry Ford famously paid his assembly-line workers enough to afford the cars they were building; it was good for business.\nYet on Wednesday, the GOP debate will include the voice of Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky - who has proposed a flat tax that would completely flip the decades-old progressive tax pyramid in which the wealthiest pay the highest rates - and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who would eliminate taxes on capital gains and dividends, which almost exclusively benefit the wealthy.\nNot a single one of them - and not even Jesus, according to Huckabee - supports raising the minimum wage. Every one of them would repeal Obamacare, despite its success in keeping people out of medical bankruptcy. And every Republican candidate views poor people merely as moochers and welfare queens who only want free stuff from Democrats rather than, you know, decent-paying jobs.\nOf course, outside the sanctuary of the CU arena, none of this will play well in Boulder, where everyone from the ivory-tower professors to the semi-homeless buskers on the Pearl Street Mall recognize that until Republicans abandon trickle-down economics, they no longer can claim to be fiscally conservative — nor responsible.\nAnd that's no joke.\nSteve Lipsher (slipsher@comcast. net) of Silverthorne writes a monthly column.
