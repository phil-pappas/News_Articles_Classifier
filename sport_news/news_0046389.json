After facing teams like Battle High School and Centerville High School from Iowa that ran uptempo styles of play, it was a very different style when Brookfield came to town. But after the Lady Tigers got used to slower style of play, they managed to muscle their way past Brookfield, 2-0 (25-13, 25-19). “I know the girls said it was such a slow paced game and that’s what they really struggled with tonight,” Kirksville coach Marlene Talbert said. “It was an even slower paced game than in practice and it was certainly not their ‘A’ game but we had a competitive edge to start the game. Brookfield’s program is still very young.” This is the second year for varsity volleyball action for Brookfield and while it’s relatively new to the scene, its style of play caught Kirksville off guard. The Lady Tigers and Brookfield stayed close in the first set but midway through the set, Kirksville pulled away. “It was definitely a different paced game than we were used to. We’re used a lot faster paced game,” Kirksville’s Sarah Lamp said. When it became apparent that Kirksville had the edge, Talbert starting changing things around and trying some new things out in the second set. “We took it as a chance to put in some younger players and kind of see how they play. We mixed up our rotation a little bit with a lot of the same players,” Talbert said. “We subbed in JoJo Nichting, who we pulled up from the freshman team and let her get some middle time in because that’s where we see her going into the future. We were two points away from winning and I wanted Rhea (Rechav) to do her jump serve and try it in a game. That’s a lot of pressure to be in a game situation. The heat was on and it went out but over, so she can build some confidence with that.” With the district tournament just around the corner, the win was a good confidence booster for the Lady Tigers. “I think that mixture of how we played is good for us. It keeps us playing on our toes. “It was a good win to get under our belt even if they were a younger program,” Lamp said. “We’re ready for tomorrow.” Talbert is going to point to all the service aces and kills and tell her players that this is a very real possibility for the rest of the season if they focus on themselves instead of how another team is playing. Page 2 of 2 - “We’re going to talk about what we did well tonight and there are other teams that are kind of slow paced but we’ve got to focus on us and play our game,” Talbert said. “The stats show tons of aces and lots of kills, which we’re capable of every night but we’re just not doing it. We’ve just got to make them realize that they can do this every night if they play their game instead of someone else’s.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T05:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:41:08.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
