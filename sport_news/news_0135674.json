The Panthers are also one of five unbeaten teams remaining in the NFL, joining New England, Cincinnati, Denver and Green Bay. \nRyan Mathews ran for 97 yards, including a 63-yard touchdown, but the Eagles (3-4) were only able to convert three interceptions by Newton into six points. \nThe Panthers held Sam Bradford to 205 yards passing and sacked him five times, including twice by Jared Allen. \nNewton finished 14 of 24 for 197 yards. He had three picks, but two of them hit his wide receivers in the hands. \nLast November, the Panthers turned the ball over on two of their first three plays in an embarrassing 45-21 loss to the Eagles on Monday Night Football. They seemed determined to start this prime-time game a little better. \nStewart ran twice for 45 yards on Carolina's first two plays from scrimmage, Newton zipped a pass to Philly Brown for 25 yards and Tolbert scored on the fourth play of the drive on a 2-yard run for a quick 7-0 lead. \nThe Panthers pushed the lead to 14-3 when Newton reached the ball across the goal line for a 2-yard score. It was his fourth rushing touchdown of the season. Young totaled 43 career rushing touchdowns over 15 seasons. Newton has 37 just six games into his fifth season. \nTolbert pushed the lead to 21-6 when he caught a pass in the flat, bounced off a hit from Malcolm Jenkins and carried four Eagles into the end zone with him for a 2-yard TD reception. \nBut the Eagles wouldn't go away. \nMathews' 63-yard burst up the middle quieted the crowd, and cornerback Byron Maxwell intercepted Newton on a ball that deflected off the hands of Devin Funchess leading to a field goal by the Eagles. \nTrailing 24-16, the Eagles had one last chance to tie and send it into overtime, but Allen came up with two sacks and a tipped pass on the crucial series with less than three minutes to play. Allen now has 136 career sacks, more than any active player in the league. \nEagles seven-time Pro Bowl left tackle Jason Peters was carted off the field in the first quarter with back spasms after he fell to the ground while trying to block Allen. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:34:07.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
