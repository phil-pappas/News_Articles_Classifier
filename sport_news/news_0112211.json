We had trouble with their speed and athleticism. They kept us under pressure.” \nRidgefield improved to 10-2-3 on the season. The Eagles are now 8-5-2. \n“We know how tough it is to come into a place as tough as Trumbull, always well coached and well organized, especially on senior night,” Ridgefield head coach Alex Harrison. “(It was important that) We got the goal early.” \nGrace Franklin gave Ridgefield the lead with an arching free kick only 3:47 into the contest. \nKatie Jasminski next put a crossing pass at the feet of Alyssa Bonnano, who punched the ball through Trumbull’s diving goalkeeper Cassidy Scofield to take the score to 2-0 at the 22-minute mark. \nSarah Battipaglia chipped in a goal that beat Trumbull keeper Aisling Maguire in the 58th minute. Jasminski got the assist after working for possession in the corner. \n“We got those two first half scores and then added our third,” Harrison said. “Last year we conceded only eight goals. This season our defense is as strong and building from the back we’ve been able to put the ball in the goal.” \n“I thought our midfield with Rebecca Crosley, Jillian Presser and Lauren Coty played well,” Uhrlass said. “And it was good to have Kyri (Marinos) back. We’ve seen some good progress.” \nTrumbull will complete its regular season with a road match at Darien High on Tuesday, Oct. 27, at 4 p.m. Related posts:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:18:37.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
