Courtesy of Tiana Fough Tiana Fough's only wish when she boarded American Airlines Flight 408 in Arizona last Sunday was to get home to Oregon and her young daughters and her husband.\nIt wasn't to be. After she was removed from the Phoenix-to-Portland flight before takeoff -- for seemingly no reason in her eyes or those of many who were seated near her in the plane's cabin -- she found her Tillamook home at the center of a media storm.\nStarting Tuesday morning, the 27-year-old stay-at-home mom began fielding interview requests from Inside Edition, NBC, Fox, the Washington Post and numerous Portland TV stations.\nOverwhelmed by the attention -- Twitter messages have been rolling in from supporters all over the world -- she and her husband, Jacob, left their 3- and 4-year-old daughters with Jacob's mom and hit the road Thursday morning to get away from it all.\n@AmericanAir The flight attendant owes Tiana Fough a personal apology. I'll never fly American again. Power tripping employees go too far.\n— Christopher Backley (@REALNightBeast) October 15, 2015 @AmericanAir Shame on you for Tiana Fough treatment. No interest in flying with you again.\n— Peter McVary (@cameraman502) October 15, 2015 Fough's ordeal -- spelled out in international news coverage and viewed through a passenger-shot cell phone video that's been posted, removed and reposted to YouTube -- struck a chord with the traveling public.\nAnyone who has flown a commercial airline in the past five years knows how much fun it isn't: crowded planes, shrinking leg and seat room, added charges for luggage, fees for a pillow or a blanket. Some airlines have floated the idea of having standup seats to pack in more passengers.\nDebbi Custer of World Travel Inc. in Northwest Portland, a travel professional for 28 years, said the changes in airline travel in the past 15 years and, more importantly, the past 5 years has led to increased stress among travelers and airline crews.\n\"There are more people flying on fewer flights,\" Custer said. \"The stress starts the moment you get in the car or a cab to go the airport. Then you have to sometime strip at security. It's no surprise that people's blood pressure levels are heightened.\"\nOn Thursday morning during a stop on an Eastern Oregon road trip with her husband, the 27-year-old related to The Oregonian/OregonLive her story of the confrontation with an American Airlines flight attendant who, in her words, \"just lost it.\"\nFough had already boarded the plane after a four-day trip that included a sidetrip with a girlfriend to Tucson. She was in the aisle when the male flight attendant started yelling at her for not quickly moving out of the passageway.\n\"I didn't even realize he was talking to me, he never made eye contact,\" Fough said. \"He said he had asked me to move four times and then I was asking him his name. He threatened to kick me off the plane.\"\nAfter she took her window seat on the right side of the plane, the attendant, who Fough said was by now fuming mad, stopped in the aisle and opened the overhead bin. He asked her where her bag was and then told her she was \"getting off the plane right now,'' Fough recalled.\nIn a video shot by a fellow passenger, Fough can be heard tearfully asking the attendant why he was being so mean to her. She had done nothing to deserve this kind of treatment, she said.\nFellow passengers agreed. Some mumbled that they would never fly American Airlines again. Others expressed their outrage with a chorus of boos as a sobbing Fough was escorted off the plane. When passengers confronted the attendant, he told them that Fough swore at him.\n\"He said that I had called him a bad name, and that's something I didn't do and never do,\" she said.\n\"It's a stressful job,\" Fough said, \"and if he can't handle it, maybe it's not the job for him.\"\nAfter leaving the plane, American Airlines employees at the gate told her they were sorry it happened and booked her on a flight back to Portland departing four hours later.\nAirline employees at the gate told her to file an online complaint, which she did when she returned to Portland. An email response from the airline, she said, told her that airline managers did not believe her experience merited compensation -- restitution that she never asked for.\nOn Tuesday, she missed three phone calls from the airline, but later talked with a representative who offered her a $250 voucher to fly on American Airlines. When she said she would never fly the airline again, they offered her $250 in cash.\n\"That's far short of the $362 ticket I bought for my trip,'' Fough said. \"I was so excited to get home to see my babies. That was probably the hardest part of it.\"\nLeslie Scott, an American Airlines spokeswoman, wrote in an e-mail statement to The Oregonian/OregonLive that the incident has been resolved.\n\"We are in contact with the passenger and have apologized,\" the statement reads. \"We have addressed the issue with our team members to ensure we provide a consistent, quality travel experience for our customers in the future.\"\nBut to Fough, the issue isn't fully resolved. She said she is searching for an attorney to take up her case.\nLee Weinstein, of Weinstein PR in Portland, said his advice to American Airlines managers would be to make it right, make it personal and make sure the message is not superficial.\n\"They need to go back and find out what happened and get to the bottom of it,'' Weinstein said Thursday by telephone, coincidentally, from inside an American Airlines jet that had just landed in Ohio. \"Everybody who saw the video, everyone on the plane thought it was wrong and the company has to deal with that.\"\nThe lesson, Fough thinks, is one that everyone should heed, whether you're dealing with customers or you're a customer yourself.\n\"Be courteous to one another,'' she said. \"We all have stress going on, but there is no reason to be rude. I'm not rude to flight attendants and they should not be rude to me ... there are consequences.\"\n-- Stuart Tomlinson\nstomlinson@oregonian.com\n503-221-8313\n@ORweather\nCourtesy of Tiana Fough", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/REALNightBeast/status/654697410581540864", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/A-oNqumUQTE", "https://twitter.com/cameraman502/status/654752705085239296", "https://twitter.com/ORweather", "https://twitter.com/AmericanAir"], "published": "2015-10-16T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:03:38.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
