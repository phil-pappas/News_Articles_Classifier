The best-of-five series starts Friday with the site to be determined. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T03:28:59.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
