By Dennis Knight Calvary Day football coach Mark Stroud didn’t know what to expect when a group of underclassmen earned playing time for the Cavaliers before the season started.\nBut the group has performed admirably for a Calvary squad that is off to a 4-0 start and ranked No. 3 among Class A teams by the Georgia Sports Writers Association.\nFreshman Nolan Smith is starting on both sides of the ball at running back and defensive end, while classmate Jalen Leary earned the job as a starting cornerback. Freshman Jeremy Smith has become a playmaker as a running back, often following the blocks of sophomore Vince Grassi. Freshman Grant Thomas is starting in the defensive backfield for the Cavaliers, who are allowing just 4.5 points per game entering tonight’s matchup with visiting Jenkins County.\nThe youngsters are complementing a squad that includes veterans like senior lineman Alex Herndon, junior quarterback Sal Calderon, senior linebacker Brent Sanders and classmates Rich Rappa and Daniel Prescott.\n“This is the most freshmen I’ve ever had contributing, but they have stepped right in and played a role in our success,” Stroud said. “I wasn’t sure what level they would contribute at, but they have played well. They have different strengths and abilities, but they are all in the mix for us right now.”\nNolan Smith has rushed for a team-high seven touchdowns while averaging 5.4 yards a carry and rushing for 244 yards. The 6-foot-2, 180-pounder is also making plays as a defensive end.\n“Nolan is a downhill, physical type of runner who likes to take it between the tackles,” Stroud said.\nLeary is the fastest of the bunch and is using that speed at corner. He is also averaging 14 yards a carry in his limited carries so far this year on offense.\nJeremy Smith has 227 yards rushing and three touchdowns, while averaging 7.6 yards per carry.\n“Jeremy is working his way into our offense, and he has provided some big runs,” Stroud said. “He is physical and can run well on the outside, too.”\nStroud said Thomas has been playing well at safety, while Grassi has been a grinder with his blocking, clearing the way for a ground game averaging 267 yards a game, and running for a pair of touchdowns.\n“These guys may be young, but they are gaining more experience with every game they play,” Stroud said. “They are becoming mature. It’s been a pleasant surprise and they are only going to get better.”\nCadets earn national ranking\nDefending GHSA Class AA champion Benedictine (4-0) is atop the state polls once again, as the Cadets are ranked No. 1 by the Georgia Sports Writers Association heading into tonight’s non-region matchup with visiting Wayne County.\nThe Cadets are also making noise nationally as BC was No. 9 this week in the CBS Maxpreps Small School National rankings.\nGreater Atlanta Christian, which lost to host BC 47-44 in a double-overtime setback in Week 1, is ranked at No. 21.\nTrinity Christian Academy of Jacksonville, Fla., is ranked No. 1, with Coldwater and Marion Local, both of Ohio, at No. 2 and No. 3.\nLichtenberg plays\nfor Boston College\nSavannah Country Day alumnus Colton Lichtenberg converted a pair of extra points and made a 25-yard field goal for his first collegiate points in Boston College’s 17-14 win over visiting Northern Illinois on Saturday.\nLichtenberg played after senior Alex Howell was sidelined with a hamstring injury, the Boston Globe reported.\nScholarship offers\nThe football scholarships offers continue to roll in for Jenkins standout Arkeem Byrd. The running back/defensive back got his first Big Ten offer last week from Minnesota. That makes 14 offers for the senior, including Kansas, Wyoming, Georgia Southern and Colorado State.\nCalvary Day’s Alex Herndon received an offer from Charleston Southern last week. The senior two-way lineman also has offers from Army and Air Force.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-01T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:24:45.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
