By Charlie Firth (columnist) 23 Oct 2015 09:57:04 \nreads \ncomments \nBustling with top quality footballers, the Premier League is an interesting watch. Players are judged by fans every week, allowing them to gather their own opinion on their quality. \nOf course, you have the regular stars of the division, such as Sergio Aguero, Eden Hazard, Wayne Rooney, and from there you have players who are, only this season, beginning to make a name for themselves, like Jamie Vardy, Riyad Mahrez, Odion Ighalo, but who are the players who perform regularly, but don’t get quite the recognition they deserve? Here are a few players I think are among the most underrated in the Premier League: \nBojan – Stoke City \nEyebrows were raised when the Spanish maestro made the odd switch from sunny Barcelona to the less glamorous Stoke. Mark Hughes’ £3 million poach certainly captured the imaginations of fans, and has come off as a shrewd signing. \nThe Catalan clubs top scorer – academy wise – was enduring a fine season before a nightmare injury in January, ruling him out for the rest of the 2014/15 season, denting the Potters hopes of a late Europa League raid. \nBojan, 25, is a player who can operate across the frontline, or in a slightly reserved attacking midfield role, and seems to perform on a regular basis without making the headlines, but is he the League's most underrated player? \nAnder Herrera – Manchester United \nHerrera was a player high on the list of transfer targets at Manchester United for a couple of years, and after Louis Van Gaals introduction at the club, they finally managed to get a hold of him, for the humble fee of just over £28 million. \nWhat does the Spaniard need to do to cement a first team spot? For me, he seems to impress every time he plays but still doesn’t manage to stay in the side. It doesn’t surprise me that Barcelona are monitoring his situation. \nHowever, a goal and an assist against Everton may go someway into helping him in his aim, but I think Herrera is definitely an underrated player, no more than by his manager. \nJose Fonte – Southampton \nEven I felt robbed when Jose Fonte didn’t get a place in the PFA Team of the Season last year – despite holding one of the best defensive records in the league over the last couple of years with Southampton. \nMany scoffed when the Saints captain was linked with Liverpool, but I actually think he’s one of the divisions leading centre halves, and could probably fit into the vast majority of teams in the league. \nFonte doesn’t get the credit he deserves, and the Portuguese international is undoubtedly one of the most underrated players in the Premier League. \nFernandinho – Manchester City \nAnother one who’s frighteningly underrated, I don’t think anyone really appreciates the pivotal role that the Brazilian plays for Manchester City, and has formed a quite excellent partnership with the bullish Yaya Toure. \nA fee of £34 million seemed like an enormous amount to fork out for a 28-year-old holding midfielder, but it seems worth every penny now, as he’s added more stability and aggression in front of the City defence. \nAs well as that, he has a vicious strike on him, a fair chunk of his 10 English goals could be classified as ‘Doelpunts.’ Let alone the Premier League, I reckon Fernandinho could be one of the most underrated players in the world. \nMoussa Sissoko – Newcastle United \nFor the player Moussa Sissoko has become, the £1.5 million Newcastle gave Toulouse in 2013 seems like an absolute steal for the now French international, who has worked his way into becoming an integral part of the Magpies side. \nHe sort of seems like the transfer that never happens, as he’s constantly linked with a switch to Arsenal, although I’m not convinced as to how much game time he’d get there. \nWhat is his position? Behind the striker or out wide? Well, judging by his performance against Norwich, it’s out wide. When the number 7’s on his A game, he’s a world beater, and is very underrated. \nJames McArthur – Crystal Palace \nI think it would probably be fair to say that the vast majority of defensive midfielders are underrated. It’s a role with precious little glory, and the odd red card as well. James McCarthur had a number of clubs battling for him a couple of years ago, and ended up going the Palace way, a good decision, as it’s turned out. \nQuite simply, the Scotsman is very, very good at what he does. Making tackles, interceptions, spraying out passes and switching defence into attack. If he were four years younger, he’d be one of the most in demand players in the league. \nMost Palace fans would tell you McArthur is a top player, and I think he’s incredibly underrated. \nJeffrey Schlupp - Leicester City \nA shock target for Arsenal over the summer, Leicester’s young player of the season 2014/15 is developing into an impressive young player, who can play in a number of positions, which is always helpful. \nThe Ghanaian is currently operating at left wing back for an in form Leicester side, and his enormous strength and pace are assets coveted by every player who plays the game. Schlupp has both in abundance. \nTo be able to play in all these positions, to be able to do all these jobs (tackling, passing, crossing, shooting etc.) is very rare and very impressive, and that reason alone makes Schlupp extremely underrated. \nSo, there you have it. There are my picks of players who don’t get the plaudits they deserve, but of course they are only a handful, and there are many more. Who would you suggest as the most underrated players in the league? Or, is it one of the players on my list? Whoever it may be, let us know in the comments below.
