Image 11 of 11 High School football: 10 takeaways from week 4 1 / 11 Back to Gallery \nA look back at Week 4 of the high school football season and what we learned. \n1. Rebel stand: Behind a pounding running game, New Fairfield rolled over Masuk 41-13 for the first win by the Rebels over the Panthers since 1994, snapping a 17-game losing streak. The Rebels could run the table until a Nov. 13 home showdown with Newtown. New Fairfield is a legitimate contender in Class M. \n2. Wrecking balls: The Staples backfield combination of Ethan Burger and Connor Adrian dominated the ground attack as the Wreckers stomped Warde 35-15. Burger ran for 103 yards and three touchdowns in the first half and Adrian went for 93 of his 125 yards in the second half, scoring a touchdown. \n3. Getting defensive: Shelton forced four turnovers in the first half, including an interception that Chris Kanios returned 62 yards for a touchdown as the Gaels defeated Notre Dame-West Haven 17-7. Kevin Robinson and Keith Prior added interceptions for the Gaels, who visit West Haven in Week 5. \n4. The Knight train: What defensive back wants to try and tackle Stamford’s 6-foot, 230-pound running back Tyrell Diaz in the open field? The monster truck of a running back scored three times on runs of 75, 1 and 78 yards as Stamford defeated McMahon 26-22. \n5. Bobcats back at it: A week after losing to rival Newtown in a lopsided affair, Brookfield responded with a 34-6 SWC victory over Barlow. \n6. Backing it up: With starting running back Luke Bienstock out with an injury, Greenwich’s Kevin Iobbi took over in the backfield, running for 98 yards and three touchdowns and scoring on pass from QB Nic Smoler. \n7. Seymour scare: Ansonia was given a scare Thursday night from NVL-rival Seymour once again. Despite some tense moments, the Chargers stayed unbeaten with a 35-14 win in a game played at Oxford High School . \n8. The legend of Tiger Hollow: Ridgefield’s home field is never a fun experience for visiting teams and Norwalk learned that Friday night, falling to the Tigers 24-15 in the Hollow Friday night. The win moves Ridgefield to 2-1. \n9. Nighthawks are soaring: Newtown won big for the fourth straight week, pounding Bethel 42-0. The Nighthawks have won each of their first four games by at least 28 points, outscoring the opposition 171-21 so far. \n10. Slippery pigskin: With a torrential rain falling Friday night across the region nobody has more trouble holding onto the ball than Weston which fumbled seven times, losing five as Bunnell capitalized, beating the Trojans 34-14. \nScott.Ericson@scni.com; @EricsonSports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T01:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T05:01:19.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
