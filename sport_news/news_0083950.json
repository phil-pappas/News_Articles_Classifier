The Sounders will play host to the Los Angeles Galaxy in a playoff elimination game later this week. Dean J. Koepfler The News Tribune i Order Reprint of this Story SEATTLE \nClint Dempsey scored two goals and assisted on another, all in the first 20 minutes of the game, as the Seattle Sounders beat Real Salt Lake, 3-1, to wrap up an MLS playoff berth Sunday. \nThe Sounders (15-13-6, 51 points) ended the regular season on an eight-game unbeaten streak (4-0-4). They have made the playoffs in all seven years of their existence. \nWith Sundayâ€™s other results, the Sounders are the No. 4 seed in the Western Conference. They will play host to No. 5 seed and defending MLS Cup champion Los Angeles in a knockout game on Wednesday. \nDempsey put the Sounders on the board in the fifth minute when he met a cross from Obafemi Martins at the top right corner of the 6-yard box and sent it into the net while falling to the turf. It was his ninth goal of the year. \nMarco Pappa scored in the 10th minute off of a cross from Dempsey. In the 20th Dempsey made it 3-0 when he buried the rebound of a hard shot by Martins. Luis Gill scored in the 77th minute for Salt Lake (11-15-8, 41 points), which missed the playoffs after seven consecutive appearances.
