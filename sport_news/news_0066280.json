We're at three, so I'm really proud of that. \n\"The will to win today for us, that's what got us through.\" \nUW-Platteville 30, UW-Stevens Point 27: Jack Eddy's fourth touchdown pass of the day, a 4-yard connection to Russell Martin with 6:14 remaining, carried the host Pioneers (4-1, 1-1 WIAC) over the Pointers (3-2, 1-1). \nEddy threw for 375 yards for Platteville, which overcame four turnovers in its homecoming game. \nQuinn Buschbacher caught nine passes for 127 yards and a touchdown, and Patrick Sheehan also hauled in nine passes for 115 yards and a score for the Pioneers. \nKyle Larson had two touchdown passes, but he also threw two interceptions for Point. \nUW-River Falls 10, UW-Eau Claire 7: Ryan Kusilek's 20-yard field goal with 4:57 remaining in the second quarter proved to be the winner as the Falcons (3-2, 2-0 WIAC) picked up a road victory over the Blugolds (0-5, 0-2). \nThe Falcons were led by their pass defense, which produced three sacks for a loss of 17 yards and three interceptions. \nUW-La Crosse 28, UW-Stout 21: The host Eagles (2-3, 1-1 WIAC) got three touchdown passes from John Tackett against the Blue Devils (1-4, 0-2). \nStout pulled within seven points on Adolfo Pacheco's touchdown with 2:40 remaining, but the Blue Devils were unable to recover the ensuing onside kick. \nJoel Oxton was Tackett's main target as the receiver snared 11 passes for 143 yards and a touchdown.
