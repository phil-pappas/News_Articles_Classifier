(AP) — Regan Smith strengthened his NASCAR Xfinity Series championship push with a victory Saturday at Dover International Speedway. \nSmith won for the second time this season and moved within 36 points of series leader Chris Buescher with five races left in the season. \nSmith would love to add a championship to his resume. He faces an uncertain future with JR Motorsports after the organization signed Elliott Sadler for next season. \nDenny Hamlin was second, followed by Kyle Busch, Ryan Blaney and Kyle Larson. Buescher finished eighth and has a 24-point lead over Chase Elliott. \nTy Dillon tumbled from second to fourth in the standings after an early wreck dropped him to 28th in the race. \nThe race was red-flagged for 31 minutes because of rain.
