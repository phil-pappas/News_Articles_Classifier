The bigger issue is that he hasn’t pitched in a real game in three weeks because of a back injury.\nThe Mets love his competitiveness as much as they love his overpowering stuff, and they point to his ability to raise his game the last two years in minor-league playoffs, flirting with a no-hitter last year in Double-A.\nBut he’ll be a long way from Binghamton on Tuesday night, living out the childhood dream of pitching a postseason game for the team that he and his entire family on Long Island rooted for since he can remember.\nThrow in the fact that he’s matching up against Kershaw, and it’s an awful lot to ask from Matz, especially considering the circumstances.\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE\nEven if he’s on his game, his lack of work of late means he probably won’t go deep into the game. Collins said he hoped for five or six innings, which means he might well need Jon Niese for a couple of innings the way he needed Bartolo Colon on Monday night.\n“We’ve gotta protect Steve a little bit,\" Collins said. “He hasn’t pitched in a while. If Bart can give us an inning, it would help. If not, we’ll have Niese or (Hansel) Robles.\"\nThat’s not the ideal scenario against Kershaw. Then again, despite pitching well in Game 1, the three-time Cy Young Award winner admitted to being outpitched by Jacob deGrom, and surely has to be feeling the weight of his postseason failures.\nIn any case, as Collins said, there was never any real doubt that Kershaw would pitch Game 4 on three days rest, yet Don Mattingly hadn’t made it official by the time Collins did his pre-game press conference on Monday.\nSo the manager was asked if he had a preference about who he’d rather see in Game 4, Alex Wood or Kershaw on short rest, and his reaction was hilarious.\n“Would I have any preference?’’ he repeated, as he began chuckling. “Yeah, I got preference,\" he said in a way that cracked up a room full of media. “I don’t want to…believe me, this is no slap at Alex Wood. He’s a fine pitcher, but I don’t want that other monster on the mound, I can tell you that.\"\nCollins was the Dodgers’ minor league director of operations when they drafted Kershaw, and observed him up-close for awhile.\n“You could tell he was special from Day 1,\" Collins said once, and a few years ago he compared Harvey to him in terms of work ethic and desire to be great.\nWith that in mind, he expected Harvey to be great in Game 3, making a point of calling him “our ace\" the last couple of days, but the star righthander wasn’t sharp, falling behind 3-0 in the second inning.\nFortunately for him, after all the recent controversy, the offense made sure he wasn’t the story. Nor was Utley, as the Mets took their revenge with home runs rather than beanballs, and by night’s end it felt as if they had complete control of this series.\nIf only that were true.\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 4 NEXT SLIDE > So, Mets fans were not too pleased with Chase Utley. They brought some signs to let everyone know how they felt. Here are some of the best...
