Macey Harrington and Shana Oliver have been the co-aces of the team since the first day. On Thursday, it would take both options to hold off Kirksville as Macon advanced past Kirksville with a 3-2 victory in the Class 3, District 8 semifinal game. “We’re still young this year, but we finally got over the hump of winning a (big) game,“ Macon coach Kyle Robuck said. “Last year, we got upset as the No. 2 seed, so I think this is going to help us relax a little bit on Saturday. Hopefully, we just relax, play and let our talent take over.” After Harrington gave the Tigerettes a 2-0 lead in the first inning with a two-RBI double, she found herself in trouble in the third inning. Kirksville managed to put two on with one out and scratched across a run to cut the lead to 2-1. Robuck may have considered lifting Harrington then, but stayed with his starter. She and her defense managed to wriggle out of that jam but Kirksville put the pressure on again the very next inning, putting two on with one out and that’s when Robuck made the change, bringing in Oliver. “She (Macey Harrington) was getting away from the strike zone a little bit and I felt at that point the only way Kirksville would score is if we started walking people,” Robuck said. “We have two options that we can go to on any night, so we might as well move to the second option.” Oliver came in and she and the defense again wriggled out of the jam, this time without letting up a run. “I thought our defense made a lot of good plays behind me, because some of those balls could have been hits but they made some excellent plays behind me,” Oliver said. Macon would push across a run in the bottom half of the fourth to extend the lead to 3-1 and that run would prove to be the difference. Kirksville got its leadoff runner on in the seventh and Annelise Billington brought her around with an RBI double to cut the lead to 3-2 with two outs in the seventh. But after fouling two pitches, Annabel Zimmer grounded out to end the game. Despite the loss, Kirksville coach Samantha Schottel couldn’t have been more proud of her team. “I’m very proud of this team. This season has been incredible. We have fought from the very beginning to the very last pitch and that’s what I ask for and that’s what I want,“ Schottel said. “We work hard and you can tell that they were having fun and that’s what matters.” Page 2 of 2 - The Kirksville program will close the books on five seniors, Lauren Houston, Annelise Billington, Carley Walters, Jessica Fleshman, Gabriella Abreo, that made an impact on the program on and off the field and Schottel knows the program will miss them. “These five seniors are powerful and confident women and I can’t wait to see what they do in life. They’re going to do great things in life and I’m so thankful for the opportunity to coach them for two years,” Schottel said. Macon will play the winner of the Mexico-Moberly game on Saturday morning for the Class 3, District 8 championship. Macon went 3-0 in the regular season against the two schools but Robuck was quick to point out that it doesn’t matter what happened in the regular season. “We’re 3-0 against both of those teams this year. We haven’t seen Mexico’s best pitcher but it doesn’t matter who’s better this year, it matters who plays better on Saturday,“ Robuck said. “Hopefully, tonight is just a confidence booster. We’re going to try and show up and play a good game.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:01:27.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
