Field-goal percentage is down across the league.\n\"It's a crazy season for kickers, and to be honest, nothing's really changed,\" Lions kicker Matt Prater said. \"Just the extra point moved back a little bit. But other than that, kicking's kicking. The uprights are still the same width and everything. I think if anything, guys are overthinking it.\"\nPrater, who signed last October to end a carousel of kickers that brought the likes of Nate Freese and Alex Henery to Allen Park, is one of 12 kickers across the league who has yet to miss a field goal.\nGranted, he has had only three attempts thanks to a sluggish offense, but Prater is a rarity in the NFL these days: a trusted leg who is secure in his job.\nFive teams already have made a change at kicker, and the Steelers are on their fourth of the season.\nShaun Suisham and Garrett Hartley suffered season-ending injuries in the preseason, and the Steelers cut Josh Scobee in favor of Chris Boswell after he missed two kicks in a three-point loss to the Ravens this month.\nKicking has become such an epidemic that two teams — the Lions and Jaguars — traded kickers in the preseason.\nKyle Brindza, the undrafted rookie the Lions sent to the Buccaneers for tight end Tim Wright, lasted four games before he was cut for missing half of his 12 field-goal attempts.\nBrindza had a workout for the Saints last week.\n\"When you're a rookie kicker and you go from one organization to another one and you have a different coach and they want you to kind of mold you into their style of kicking, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't,\" Prater said. \"From what I understand, that was part of the problem I think with him being here and changing up his technique. And he was kicking great when he was here, then the first couple weeks there he was kicking great. I think he was in between the ears thinking about his technique more than kicking the ball.\"\nThe mental side of kicking has claimed a number of victims over the years, including Freese, a seventh-round pick out of Boston College, last fall.\nCoach Jim Caldwell said the added pressure of 33-yard extra points seems to be weighing on kickers.\nAfter years of being spotted at the 2-yard line, extra-point attempts are spotted at the 15 this year.\n\"I don't think it's as easy as it's sort of talked about,\" Caldwell said. \"It is difficult. I just think that this year, and some of it may be a bit of a psychological issue, too, where it's no longer considered just a chip shot, which I think they certainly felt that way when it was up in the normal range.\"\nThe Lions and their opponent Sunday, the Bears, have stable kicking situations, with the Bears' Robbie Gould 11-for-11 on field goals with three of at least 50 yards.\nBut Caldwell said he doesn't see any end to the league's newfound kicking problems in sight.\n\"I think in regard to the extra point, I can tell you it's only scratched the surface because the weather hasn't gotten bad yet,\" Caldwell said. \"Wait till the wind starts blowing here shortly and you're outside a little bit more. Those extra points, I think you're going to see the number of misses go up, and I also think you're going to see the number of attempted two-point plays go up as well.\"\nContact Dave Birkett at dbirkett@freepress.com .
