He took off his helmet and bowed down on the turf in celebration.\nShafiq also completed his century with a sweep boundary off leg-spinner Adil Rashid as the pair erased the previous best fifth-wicket stand of 219 set by Paul Collingwood and Eoin Morgan at Nottingham in 2010.\nShafiq went soon after tea, when he was trapped leg before wicket off seamer Mark Wood while Sarfraz Ahmed (two) and Zulfiqar Babar (nought) also fell to Stokes.\nStokes was England's most successful bowler with 4-57 while Anderson took 2-42.\nPakistan declared soon after tea, leaving England to bat the remaining 23 overs.\nEarlier, Malik resumed at 124 and hit a four and six off wicket-less Rashid before smashing a boundary off seamer Wood to better his previous best score as well as completing 150.\nHis previous best of 148 not out came against Sri Lanka in Colombo in 2006.\nBoth Malik and Shafiq left the England bowlers to toil in the first two sessions and rue the two chances they failed to grab against the two batsmen.\nMalik was caught off a Stuart Broad no-ball on 40 and Shafiq was let off by Bell off Anderson when on 10 -- both on Tuesday.\nBoth England's spinners -- debutant Rashid and Moeen Ali -- failed to make an impact on a pitch which is expected to take turn as the game progresses.\nRashid, who was hit for three sixes by Malik, went wicket-less in his 34 overs conceding 163 runs -- the worst figures in an innings on debut.\nPreviously Australia's Bryce McGain had the worst figures of 0-149 on debut against South Africa at Cape Town in 2009.\nDubai will host the second Test (October 22-26) while the third will be played in Sharjah (November 1-5).
