DAVID BAUMAN, FILE PHOTO Related article » CRUNCHING THE NUMBERS Boxes sold: 2.5 million\nCookie sales: $10 million\nAverage boxes sold per girl: 357\nNumber of sellers: 6,700 girls\nCookie flavors: 9\nSale Days: 50\n*2015 data\nSource: Girl Scouts of San Gorgonio Council\nABOUT THE SCOUTS What: Girl Scouts of San Gorgonio Council\nHeadquarters: 1751 Plum Lane, Redlands\nFounded: 1968\nMembers: About 10,000 girls ages 5 to 17 in Riverside and San Bernardino counties\nSkills taught: Goal setting, decision making, money management, people skills and business ethics\nInformation: 909-307-6555, www.gssgc.org\nThey’re a tasty tradition as American as apple pie.\nGirl Scout cookies have satisfied stomachs for nearly a century, surviving 17 presidential administrations, dozens of military operations and countless calamities.\nCome January, local lovers of the savory treats may bite a bit of sour amid the sweetness.\nThe price of cookies in the Inland area is rising for the first time since 2004, jumping from $4 to $5 a box. Inflation and the need to upgrade aging camps and boost programs prompted the move.\n“Our Girl Scout troops need a raise,” said Elizabeth Locke-Thomas, executive vice president of the Redlands-based Girl Scouts of San Gorgonio Council, which serves about 10,000 girls ages 5 to 17 in Riverside and San Bernardino counties. “We want our girls to be able to fund the programs they work so hard to earn.”\nRELATED: Whose Girl Scout cookies taste better?\nThe price boost caused a little heartburn among a task force of business owners, parents and group leaders who made the decision after a year of study. Girl Scout councils in other parts of Southern California raised their prices to $5 a box in the past two years, she said. The Inland group’s 2016 sale begins Jan. 24.\n“The $4 box just doesn’t stretch the way it used to,” Locke-Thomas said. “What we pay the baker has gone up 22 percent in the past 12 years. We’re living in a world where commodities like butter, flour and eggs continue to go up and up.”\nIMPORTANT PLANS\nOther expenses also have soared, local leaders say.\nOver the summer, the Inland chapter updated 73-year-old Camp Azalea Trails near Idyllwild with new water pipes. The group also is replacing pink canvas exteriors on their tents with green coats to comply with U.S. Forest Service rules, she said.\nOfficials also want to remodel the lodge and install cabins at Camp WiWoCa in Yucaipa.\nRepairs also will be made to bring older scout houses up to code with plumbing, water heaters and other upgrades.\nThe price increase will help restore the outreach department that serves low-income and under-served areas. That department closed about seven years ago due to budget cuts, Locke-Thomas said.\n“I have three people in the High Desert from the Cajon Pass to Needles,” she said. “Even one more person could make a miraculous difference there.”\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvmh18-b88522043z.120151002191524000gsgccgca.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvmg7o-b88522043z.120151002185727000gh0ccft2.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://www.gssgc.org/", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvmg7o-b88522043z.120151002185727000gh0ccft2.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvmh18-b88522043z.120151002191524000gsgccgca.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:24:25.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
