This year Fisher just completed his 2nd year playing professional baseball in the Boston Red Soxs Minor League system. The All-State catcher had a busy end to his high school career having to prepare for a graduation, a state baseball championship game, and the Major League Baseball draft. \"It went really quick,\" Fisher said about the whole ordeal. \"With graduation I was more excited just to be done with school and continue with the next phase of my career. For the state championship game, we worked as a team all Fall and Winter to play for the state championship. I was aware of my offer (from the Boston) before the championship game. I wasn't going to let (the offer) affect me. I had a commitment to my teammates and I couldn't let my team down. It felt great bringing home a State title with the guys I've played baseball with since I was a kid.\" \nFisher helped Western Branch head coach Roland Wright win his 1st ever State championship since taking over the position in 2005. Wright has helped with the Best of the 757 Baseball event since the inaugural event and he has sent several dozen prospects to Division I colleges. Fisher says Wright helped him to prepare for life after high school. \"He definitely helped with work ethic and the mental part of the game. He told us at the next level you are going to be tired we had to be the best focused team out there. He was also very helpful with all the on-field stuff. If I needed on field batting practice when scouts came by, he would let me use the field and throw batting practice for me.\" \n\nSign-up for this years Best of the 757 baseball event here. \nFisher had committed to play college baseball for the University of Virginia but decided to start living his dream of playing professional baseball when the Red Soxs met his bonus/salary request.\"To go pro has really been my dream,\" Fisher said. \"Of course we discussed what would happen before they called my name. When Boston called, the time was right, the money was right, and I decided I wanted to get my career started.\" Less than a week after the State championship win, Fisher was in Fort Myers, Florida at the home of the Boston Red Sox Gulf Coast League Rookie team. He says his daily schedule includes a bus ride from the hotel to the baseball field, daily batting practice, working with the pitchers, and playing a game.\"I started off really well then I went a couple of games where I struggled but I got back in the cages,\" he said. \"The last game I went 3 for 5 from the plate. I'm happy with what I'm doing but of course you can always do better.\"Living away from home, in a hotel room, is the way of life for a professional baseball player. In addition, playing in the Florida heat adds another level of discomfort but Fisher says catching a baseball in 100 degree weather is more fun than taking exams. Still, he did admit he misses the Tidewater area. \n\"Of course, I miss my family and friends, and the food is definitely very different here. A lot of places don't have sweet tea,\" he said. \nBesides the food, Fisher says playing competitive baseball everyday takes a toll on your body. He did not have a summer to rest like most college freshman. \"It's the everyday grind,\" Fisher explained. \"You don't know the feeling of being a 100 percent. You just have to mentally know that you can get thru the day and give 100 percent, even when you don't feel 100 percent.\" FEATURED PRODUCT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:45:13.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
