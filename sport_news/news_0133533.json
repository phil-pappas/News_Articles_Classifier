Earlier this year the war of words reached a new level when Rousey beat out Mayweather to win the ESPY award for Fighter of The Year - and then she stated during a live television interview - “I wonder how Floyd feels being beat by a woman for once\" - a dig at Mayweather's past legal issues with domestic abuse. \nMayweather asked Rousey to call him when she made \"$300 million\" in a single fight, to which Rousey attacked back by questioning Mayweather's ability to read. \nWhat would happen if the two of them met face to face? Well, Rousey plans to make it a very awkward meeting. \n\"If I ever ran into Floyd Mayweather, I would make a point to introduce myself,\" Ronda told Cosmopolitan.com while on tour to promote her next fight against Holly Holm, which airs Nov. 14 on pay-per-view. \"Since he keeps pretending he doesn't know who I am, I wouldn't go out of my way to find him. But if I ran into him, I'd probably just introduce myself every single time that I saw him. I'd be like, 'Hi, I'm Ronda.' 'Yes, I'm Ronda.' 'Hi, I'm Ronda.' \n\"I would shake his hand because he is an amazing boxer — I think he is one of the best of all time. But I will introduce myself as many times as I need to. He apparently has a lot of trouble remembering who I am.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:17:10.698+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
