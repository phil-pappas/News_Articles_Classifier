October 21, 2015 | 3:53 pm \nCHARLES CITY — Every team, from high school to pro, has their share of sports injuries. \nCharles City High School athletics has gotten hit hard this year. The CCHS varsity football team started with 22 juniors and seniors walking off the field after the game. On Oct. 9, only 16 walked off. There are always negatives when it comes to sports injuries, however, some athletes can find the good in stepping down from their role as a starting player. \nMason Meyer, a junior at CCHS, is involved in football, basketball, track, and baseball. While playing in a Friday night football game, Meyer was hit from the side and immediately knew his football playing days were done for the time being. His injury consisted of a torn ACL, ICL, PCL, MCL, as well as a ruptured meniscus. \nMeyer has no idea when his return to sports will be. He still is waiting to have surgery. However, this star football player is hoping to be back in time for track season to throw. Meyer talked about the hardships his team has gone through with not only his, but the other players injuries as well. \n“Whenever anyone gets injured, new people have to step in that the other players aren’t use to playing with,” he said. “There is a level of trust to be built between them. It’s not always easy to adjust to that.” \nNot everyone who gets injured can find a positive. \n“I realized that I’m not here just to play sports,” he said. “I’m not here just to play football; I’m here for more.” \nThe volleyball team has gone through some changes to its lineup, as well. Three varsity players have come face-to-face with either a knee or ankle injury. \nSara Martin, a junior, said the team has struggled to find the right person to step in and there is a constant need for teammates to step up vocally on the court and let the new player know what’s going on. Volleyball is a game of ups and downs and can be difficult to maintain the level of play you want when new players are thrown in. \nMartin said a player can learn from another simply by watching from the bench. \n“I believe that those stepping in have done very well,” she said. “Even though they might not have the same abilities or skill level as the player who got hurt, they are able to fulfill those roles from all the experience they’ve had watching their superior from the bench.” \nBeing a good player goes beyond skill level. Charles City athletics have proved that. Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:52:13.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
