Oklahoma football: Sooners prepared for Kansas State's pop-pass Brady Vardeman, Assistant Sports Editor The Oklahoma Daily | 0 comments Posted on Oct 13, 2015 by Brady Vardeman \nAs reporters converged around Oklahoma defensive coordinator Mike Stoops after practice Tuesday, the Sooners’ 2014 game against Kansas State was immediately brought up. \nWhile it may be most famously remembered for OU kicker Michael Hunnicutt’s two missed field goals and blocked extra point, Stoops recalls the Wildcats’ first quarter ‘pop-pass’ from Jake Waters to Glenn Gronkowski that went for a 62-yard touchdown. \nAfter the game, Stoops said he had problems with the way the play was officiated. Because Kansas State had faked the run before throwing, he argued there were too many linemen too far downfield. \n“Well, the lineman was six yards downfield…” Stoops said. “I don’t think their lineman are as far downfield as they used to be.” \nThe play proved crucial, as Kansas State walked out of Norman with a 31-30 victory. Then-sophomore linebacker Jordan Evans was on the field for the first pop-pass. \n“We knew it was coming because we had practiced all week,” Evans said. “They ran it in the first quarter, and I just remember seeing the guy throw the ball, and I was like, ‘Wait, that’s the fullback. What’s he doing?’” \nDefensive end Charles Tapper echoed his confusion, comparing the play to Florida’s offense when it had dual-threat quarterback Tim Tebow. \n“It was like, ‘Wow, he really just scored on a pop-pass, one of the slowest guys on the field, probably,’” Tapper said. \nWhile the pop-pass is dangerous any time it’s run, it’s especially lethal at Kansas State because junior quarterback Joe Hubener is mobile. He’s already accrued 224 yards rushing and six touchdowns despite missing most of the Wildcats’ fourth game against Oklahoma State. \n“It’s really, really hard, because they like to run the ball, so our first instinct is to stop the run,” Evans said. “The fullback is their leading blocker and you want to go hit him and the next thing you know, he slips right past you and he’s behind you.\" \n“The way you stop that is, when the fullback comes to you, you just got to be physical. You got to get hands on him.” \nThis time around, the Sooners will be ready for the pop-pass, according to Stoops. \n“It’s hard, but you’ve got to account for all the eligible receivers,” he said. “You can’t just let a receiver slip by one of our middle linebackers and go down the middle of the field. We got to cover all of the eligibles.” \nThere was discussion over the offseason about changing how far linemen are allowed downfield on pass plays. In the NFL, the 'buffer zone' between linemen and eligible receivers is one yard. In college, it’s three. \nNothing was done to change the rule, however. \nEvans said the college rule makes defending the pop-pass more difficult for defenses. \n“I would say it’s more beneficial to the offense, but I’m not going to say it’s unfair,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:05:17.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
