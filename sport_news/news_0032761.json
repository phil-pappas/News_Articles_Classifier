He and his wife, Paige, gave back to so many.\n\"They not only gave me a chance but thousands of others, many that they don't even know about,\" said Frank Brigtsen, owner of Brightsen's restaurant. \"They gave people a chance to make something of themselves, and so they've left a wonderful mark on the world.\"\nLocals revered Prudhomme for bringing a taste of Louisiana to the region and the rest of the country.\n\"I am a local. I've seen Chef Paul everywhere. I used to work at the fresh market on the North Shore and he came in and he's like a local celebrity,\" said New Orleans resident Ed Synan. \"Wherever he's walking, he knows everybody. He's always been everybody's friend. You feel like you know him.\"\nMany in the culinary world reflected on the early days of Prudhomme, where he served as executive chef at the world famous Commander's Palace restaurant in New Orleans.\nThe co-owner of the restaurant, Ti Martin, said Prudhomme was one of the original celebrity chefs.\n\"Paul came here in the seventies when my mom Ella, and Dick, and all the family was here, and it's really where Cajun food, what Paul was doing and we were doing, creole food just crashed in the kitchen at Commander's. You didn't have creole food in New Orleans really before that,\" Martin said.\nPrudhomme went on to create a food empire with his personal spices, which are now sold in all 50 states and 37 countries around the world.\nHe also wrote nine cookbooks and made countless television appearances during his 50-year career.\nPrudhomme died Thursday at the age of 75. He suffered from a brief illness.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE . ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:46:06.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
