That sums up the way we're going,\" said the England centre-back.\n\"And then we've got the sending-off. Originally we played on -- we thought the referee had played on. Maybe the assistant called it back. I'm not sure sure what's happened there.\n\"We've not had the rub of the green, but we're not feeling sorry for ourselves. We have to work hard to turn this around.\"\nChelsea assistant coach Silvino Louro was also sent to the stands by Moss for protesting about Matic's dismissal, while Fabregas and Diego Costa were booked for dissent.\nWest Ham manager Slaven Bilic said that he had spoken to Mourinho after the match.\n\"I feel for him,\" the Croatian said. \"Decisions from his point of view have gone against him. I would moan if it was against us. But they are not mistakes; they are matters of opinion.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:49:25.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
