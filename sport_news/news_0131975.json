In three games, the Bruins have allowed a whopping 16 goals, which is not good for a team that prides itself on team defense and being good from the goalie out. \nThere wasn’t really a common thread among the goals allowed by the Bruins yesterday. There were a couple of power-play goals allowed, and one off a risky play high in the offensive zone. Others came from poor defensive-zone coverage. Another was a softy allowed by goalie Tuukka Rask. \n“It doesn’t matter what the situation is, we’ve got to be better defensively,” said Bruins coach Claude Julien, whose team outshot an opponent for the first time this season (30-23). “The amount of goals, from the goaltender on out, defense and forwards coming back, we’ve just got to be better. It used to be our strength. Right now, it’s our weakness.” \nAnd right now, no one is untouched by this malaise. \nThe B’s are incorporating some new and young faces into the lineup, which played a big role in their first two losses. But some of the old reliables had rough games yesterday. Rask did not help when needed while Patrice Bergeron was in the box on both power-play goals and had a giveaway on a another goal. \n“It’s one mistake after another,” said Julien. “A lot of it is us shooting ourselves in the foot.” \nThe B’s jumped on top 2-0 on power-play goals from David Krejci and Loui Eriksson, who had a pair. \nBut before the first period was out, Tampa Bay tied it. The first goal allowed came when the B’s turned the puck over at the offensive blue line to defenseman Victor Hedman, who carried in deep and threw a pass back to Brian Boyle, who scored from the slot. Just 1:09 later, after Bergeron took a goalie-interference penalty, Ondrej Palat made it 2-2. \nEarly in the second, the Lightning took the lead when Boyle, in the late stages of a penalty kill, picked off a David Pastrnak pass and scored on a breakaway. The B’s fought back to even on Eriksson’s second power-play goal. \nBut then came the backbreaker. With Bergeron in the box for holding, Tyler Johnson got away with interference on Chris Kelly to allow the Tampa Bay attack to continue. Before the B’s could clear the zone, a Steven Stamkos bullet made it 4-3. Julien was incensed on the non-call. \nWhen it was suggested that that could break the Bruins’ fragile will, Kelly said, “It better not be. That’s a hockey play. Those things happen on both sides. Calls are missed. Calls are called. That better not be, and I don’t think it is a letdown point. The play continued, and you need to work to keep that goal out of our net.” \nAfter that, the sloppiness increased to the point where the Bruins who finished the game barely resembled the B’s who started it. They allowed two more in the third and played the final minutes in front of a half-empty Garden. \n“I think we had a good start of the game. We created really good chances, obviously our power play was really good,” said Chara. “Then at some point of the game we stopped respecting the game plan and we got into trouble and that’s when teams will take advantage, especially when you play good teams like Tampa. You’re going to be paying a price for that.” \nAnd for the third straight time, the B’s did pay, dearly.
