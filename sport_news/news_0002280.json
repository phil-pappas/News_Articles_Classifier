It’s a good time.” \nAnd good memories for the Trojans, who have won four of their last six games on 12th and Northampton Street, including the most recent battle: a 13-10 overtime win in the district championship last November , when DiGirolamo picked off Trey Durrah to seal the game. \n“We always look forward to going and playing at Cottingham,” said Parkland offensive coordinator Frank Lane, a former Red Rover and member of the Easton-P’burg Hall of Fame. “It’s a great environment, great field, they’re passionate about their football. Hopefully the TVs break and everybody has to come to the game. \n“We like to go down there in a hostile environment and see what we can do.” \nRELATED : Daloni Caldwell ready for key role when Easton football hosts Parkland \nThe Trojans had speakers out on their practice field Wednesday, ready to blast some music to get them ready for the conditions at Cottingham Stadium. In the process, they will be trying to bounce back from their first loss of the year against Liberty . The last time Erik DiGirolamo played at Cottingham Stadium. (lehighvalleylive.com file photo) \nIn that game, the defense was charged with allowing more than 500 yards and 41 points, the most any team has scored on them since Nov. 24, 2012 in a 49-41 playoff win over Delaware Valley. \n“I don’t think it’s anything that (Liberty) did special,” said DiGirolamo, a captain and linebacker/running back. “Usually we like to put it on ourselves defensively. That’s the most points we’ve let up in a long time and we take that really personally on defense. We’re going to see what we can do this week to get back to that usual Parkland defense.” \nSpecifically, the Trojans were hurt on the ground where the Hurricanes piled up more than 300 yards. Figuring out how to seal those holes will be important going into Friday against an Easton offense that is averaging 253 rushing yards per game, compared to 77 passing yards. \n“We know they’re both very good offensive lines, but Liberty is a bigger offensive line and Easton’s a little smaller and stronger and faster,” DiGirolamo said. “So it’s kind of different types of offensive lines, but we still have to be physical and fast up front.” \nParkland has upped the tempo at practices this week in an attempt to translate it into gameplay for its offense, which struggled with consistency last week. \nBy the time the Trojans got in a groove, scoring quickly with big-strike plays, it ended up being too late. \n“I think we found out a lot about ourselves as a team,” DiGirolamo said. \nThe next thing they’ll learn is how they bounce back from a loss. In each of the last three years, Parkland lost at least one game in the regular season, only to go on to win the district championship. \n“Different teams respond different ways,” Lane said. “However, most of these kids were part of those district championship teams that lost one or two during the regular season and ended up making the run at the end. They should know what it’s like.” \nAnd if they can start that run Friday night, the trip home from Cottingham Stadium will be another good one. \n“I always tell the kids, it’s all about the police escort on the way home,” Lane said. “You get a police escort to (Route) 22 and then they send you on your way and don’t come back.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:51:50.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
