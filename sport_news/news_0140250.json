(AP) - Former Mississippi Gov. Ronnie Musgrove will make more arguments in a lawsuit seeking millions of dollars for 21 school districts.\nMusgrove is the attorney representing the districts, and the lawsuit says the state shortchanged them by $240 million, collectively, over six budget years.\nHinds County Chancery Judge William Singletary ruled against Musgrove and the districts in July, but has agreed to hear additional arguments Oct. 13 from Musgrove and attorneys defending the state.\nMusgrove said Thursday that he will argue Singletary's first ruling was wrong.\nMusgrove says there's \"no confusion\" about what legislators intended in 2006 when they enacted a law saying a school budget formula should be fully funded if money is available from 2007 through 2009, and that it must be fully funded starting in fiscal 2010.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
