Three of the turnovers were fumbles.\n\"The thing I'm encouraged about is these kids continue to fight to get better,\" FAU coach Charlie Partridge said. \"â€¦As we get a chance to drill things this week with the opportunity to be out there, I know that we'll get it fixed.\"\nFumbling has plagued the program the past two seasons. Last year running back Jay Warren lost the starting job because the inability to protect the ball. The Owls this week have resorted to using the \"strap\" drill, which emphasizes hold onto the ball.\n\"There are a couple obvious things we need to improve,\" Partridge said. \"Getting out there for a full week of practice will certainly help those things.\"\nRelying too much on the pass?\nPartridge defended his decision to have redshirt freshman quarterback Jason Driskel attempt a school-record 55 passes in last week's loss to Buffalo.\nPartridge said the play-calling had nothing to do with the running backs' fumbles. It was based more on the staff being confident in Driskel.\n\"We really didn't get away from our game plan,\" Partridge said. \"I have all the faith in the world in our play-calling and where we're going. We need to protect the ball better and eliminate penalties.\"\nNext game: FAU at Charlotte, 7 p.m., Saturday, Channel 33 (ASN)\nsrichardson@tribpub.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5603ec65/turbine/fl-fau-owls-news-0924-20150923"], "published": "2015-09-23T21:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:47:58.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
