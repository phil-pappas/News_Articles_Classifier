The chapel where performances take place offers a rare opportunity in Oregon for students to experience cathedral-quality, high-end acoustics.\nUnfortunately, no one at the school district came up with O'Leary's idea on their own. Instead, general counsel Jollee Patterson, responding to a complaint she received in November 2014 from a Wisconsin group, abruptly sent an email to school administrators last month, informing them that choirs could no longer participate out of concerns that the district would appear to be endorsing a particular religion. The tradition was dead, effective immediately.\nIt's not just The Grotto or Catholicism, either. Patterson's Sept. 9 email indicated that the choirs could not participate in other singing events tied to a specific religious celebration.\nPatterson has contended that the district could lose if the group that first raised the concern – Freedom from Religion Foundation – chose to sue. Well, sure. That's always the case with any issue. But she's wrong to assume that there are no other solutions – or even that the district would automatically lose.\nIn fact, the only commonality among First Amendment experts consulted by The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board is that there's no clear answer to whether such performances would violate First Amendment provisions against an \"establishment\" of religion. Each case relies on the facts at hand and, to an extent, the judge overseeing the case.\nFor example, Steven Green, a Willamette Law professor who is director of the school's Center for Religion, Law and Democracy , notes that a judge would likely weigh the prominence of religious statues, but also the prevalence of the light displays as well. The Grotto hangs more than half a million colored lights as part of its festival, which also includes a petting zoo and the concerts by choirs from throughout the Northwest and beyond.\nWhile he noted he is not familiar with all the facts of the case, he said it's likely the district is being \"overly cautious.\"\n\"My guess is a majority of people would not perceive any endorsement of religion by virtue of there being a concert at a popular seasonal location where many people go to see the lights and who are not going for any kind of religious inspiration,\" he said.\nCertainly, sensitivities differ and have changed over time. Take for instance, the Anti-Defamation League, which a few years ago circulated this advice for dealing with holidays :\n\"Public school students may be allowed to perform at churches, synagogues or temples because courts have recognized that these venues often provide excellent acoustics and atmosphere for the singing of choral music. However, a public school choir should not sing exclusively at religious sites or only at venues of a particular denomination.\"\nThat, however, has since been removed from the organization's advice. About the closest you can find now in is this proposed solution to a hypothetical situation in which a student's parents object to a concert that includes both secular and religious songs: \"The school concert may constitutionally include some religious songs provided that the concert features mostly secular songs, and that the concert as a whole is primarily educational, secular, objective and nondenominational.\" The student's participation should be voluntary, the advice notes, with no impact to grade or school record.\n\"It's tricky,\" said David Barkey, who serves as the organization's national religious freedom counsel. There's no black or white here, he said, and there may not be any case law that fits the set of facts presented in Portland's case.\nPatterson, the district's general counsel, is now expected to brief the school board in executive session on the matter. She declined to say last week whether she had consulted with a First Amendment attorney before making the decision to ban school choirs from The Grotto, telling The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board that the information falls under attorney-client privilege.\nThat's a curious interpretation. But in any event, what shouldn't fall under attorney-client privilege is a public discussion of how best to satisfy potential constitutional concerns without simply abandoning anything that could cause questions. Did the choirs have a sufficient range of nonreligious songs to sing? Could the choirs commit to performing at other religious venues? How else could the district have responded to First Amendment concerns without denying students the educational opportunity that performing at The Grotto has provided thousands of other Portland students over the years?\nPart of a school's charge is to teach students. In this case, unfortunately, the district appears to be adopting a short-sighted strategy of education by elimination.\n– The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board", "external_links": ["http://www.wweek.com/2015/10/07/portland-public-schools-orders-choirs-to-stop-singing-at-the-grotto/", "http://www.willamette.edu/law/faculty/cv/green/", "http://archive.adl.org/religious_freedom/resource_kit/december_holiday_guidelines.html", "http://www.thegrotto.org/christmas/", "http://www.adl.org/assets/pdf/civil-rights/religiousfreedom/rips/RIPS-Ch6DecDil.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-18T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:23:50.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
