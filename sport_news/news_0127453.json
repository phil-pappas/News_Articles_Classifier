He’s tied for seventh in league scoring and has been a big part of the Jets 4-2 start to the season.\nAt 29, Wheeler still seems to be getting better every year and who knows what kind of point total he can put up with the benefit of a good start.\n“His intensity level, shift to shift, is as high as anybody I’ve ever coached,” Jets coach Paul Maurice said after the Jets practiced at the IcePlex Wednesday. “His attack, his power, his speed. There are very few men that size, that move that fast. His speed is intimidating. He’ll finish checks, he plays hard on every puck. His consistency level combined with his intensity makes him a special player.”\nWhile Jets fans have come to expect big things from Wheeler year after year, he’s rarely mentioned as an elite NHL player, despite the fact that he has 64, 69 and 61-point seasons in a Winnipeg uniform.\nPerhaps that has something to do with his slow starts in previous seasons. It took him until Game 13 to get to eight points last year and the year before. It took him until Game 12 in 2012-13. In 2011-12, when he led the Jets with 64 points, he didn’t get to eight points until Game 20.\nHe is clearly more comfortable being a leader in all aspects of the game.\n“He now has a really good understanding of what makes him special, what makes him great and he perfects that in practice,” Maurice said. “He drives in practice, his practices are very similar to his game. He pushes every day.\n“Whether he gets on a run of points or not, he’s been really consistent for us. There aren’t lulls in his game, lulls in his effort at all.”\nNamed an assistant captain last year, Wheeler flourished in the leadership role. He’d certainly be a logical choice to be the team’s next captain if Andrew Ladd is not re-signed or gets traded.\nA former first-round draft pick (fifth overall) who took several years to come into his own at the NHL level, Wheeler has learned what it takes to be consistently successful.\n“When you are younger I don’t think you really understand how you are getting results,” Wheeler said Wednesday. “You just want to see the end result and you don’t really understand the process of how you’re doing that. My game’s always been about creating things and getting offensive opportunities but it’s based on hard work and a willingness to do more than the guys we’re out there against.\n“I’m five years older than when I came here. I think I know what we’re all about as a group and I think I’ve figured out what works for me, both on the ice and off the ice. I’ve really found a balance of how to prepare myself and have that 60 minutes with a foot on the gas the entire time.”\nWhile his game has clearly evolved since he first pulled on a Jets jersey, Wheeler said it really came together under Maurice’s tutelage.\n“He made it OK to win games 1-0 or 2-1 and he really put an emphasis the fact that we’re not out here trying to reach our offensive goals,” Wheeler said. “We’re part of a good team and we’re going to get all the offence we can handle because of that. A lot of good things happen from being on a good team.”\nWhile the Jets are off to their best start since arriving in Winnipeg, Wheeler actually pointed to last year’s bad start (they were 1-4 after five games) as a turning point.\n“Last year when we got off to that rough start, it forced everyone to look in the mirror,” he said. “What can you do differently? What isn’t going right? I’m never going go out there and not try to score goals because that’s part of my job but Paul made it OK to just try to out-compete whoever we’re playing against every night. From there, if you don’t score a goal and we win, it turns out to be a better feeling than going out there and getting a couple of goals.”\nBlake Wheeler's stats\nCreate your own infographics\nWinnipeg Jets winger Blake Wheeler getting better every year\nBy Ted Wyman , Winnipeg Sun First posted: Wednesday, October 21, 2015 03:40 PM EDT | Updated: Wednesday, October 21, 2015 04:34 PM EDT\nBlake Wheeler has been described as one of the most underrated players in the NHL and one of the most intense hockey players his coach has ever mentored.\nHe’s also historically been called a slow starter.\nNot this year.\nWheeler is off to his best start as a member of the Winnipeg Jets, with points in all six games and eight in total.
