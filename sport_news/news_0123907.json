Williams says he may be forced to redshirt sophomore guard Ahmed Hill. Hill has a partial-tear in a tendon in his left knee. Hill averaged 8.7 points per game and 3.7 rebounds last season as a freshman. \nTech will have six new players on the court this season. Guard Seth Allen from Maryland and Zach LeDay from South Florida are transfers who sat out last season per NCAA transfer rules. \n7-foot center Johnny Hamilton is a JUCO transfer from Jacksonville (Texas) College. \nThe Hokies have three incoming freshmen. 6-6 guard Chris Clarke from Virginia Beach, 6-1 guard Justin Robinson from Manassas, and 6-10 forward Kerry Blackshear from Orlando, FL. \nCoach Williams says, \"As players, I think those are three guys that have the skill set and the mindset that we want to have and I think they are three guys that throughout their career will be able to play together, will be able to grow together... I think those are three guys we'll always look to and say that's the foundation of what and what we want to be on and off the floor.\" \nWilliams says JUCO transfer Ty Outlaw, a 6-6 JUCO transfer from Lee College in Baytown Texas won't play this season because of an unspecified medical condition. \nVirginia Tech had a record of 11-22 last season and 2-16 in the ACC. Tech's season opener is at home on November 14th against Alabama State.
