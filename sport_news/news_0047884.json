We just had to come out and play our game. It was our job to not notice what was around us and focus on the game.\"\nThat's what the Thunderbirds did, with junior middle hitter Tabitha Paul supplying the thunder with her hits and kills, and Jaskot flying all over the place, making an assortment of plays, leading the Thunderbirds to a convincing win, 25-21, 25-20.\nThe victory enabled Mahwah to improve to 7-2, while the Patriots, the defending Group 1 champions, dropped to an uncharacteristic 7-3.\nThe Thunderbirds won the first game behind the solid net play of Paul, who helped Mahwah take control of the game with consecutive plays at the net to make the score 17-12, and Danielle Petrovic added a service ace to push the lead to 18-12.\nThe Patriots sliced the lead to 20-17 thanks to the fine play at net by Alyson Toman. But then the T-Birds scored four straight points, keyed by two service aces from Britni Jaskot, Caelin's older sister, to take a 24-17 lead and held off a Patriot surge to collect the win.\nThe second game was all Secaucus in the early going, as the Patriots jumped out to a 6-3 lead and then increased the advantage to 12-8.\nThat's when Rayside summoned Paul off the bench and that move turned the game around, as the dominating player registered two straight kills.\nSecaucus managed to take a 16-11 lead, then Paul took over again, keying a 6-1 run that included five straight points.\n\"Having Tabitha at the net takes a lot of the weight off my shoulders,\" Caelin Jaskot said. \"It's good to know that you have such a good hitter up front.\"\nPaul's domination at the net just emotionally deflates the opponent.\n\"It's an exciting feeling,\" Paul said. \"It's important to me, because I want us all to be able to hit like that. I push myself, knowing that if the ball comes to me, I can put the ball away.\"\nThe loss didn't come as a surprise to Secaucus coach Sheila Rivera. The Patriots started four freshmen in their lineup, so they're undergoing some growing pains.\nToman led the way with 13 kills and was equally tough at the net. Alexandra Ianuale, one of the four freshman starters, had nine assists, and Kristina Ulrich had nine digs.\nMahwah knows that there is a lot of season remaining, but the Thunderbirds have to be pleased where they're nesting. \"As a team, we beat Ramapo and now Secaucus,\" Paul said. \"We can beat anybody.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:42:36.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
