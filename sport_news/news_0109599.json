The sources informed that when the NBA star reached at the brothel the girls were put in a lineup so he could choose his partners for the night, but the brothel officials influenced the basketball player into picking 2 specific girls who were known to tolerate drug use, TMZ.com reported. Also, other girls later complained that brothel management should not have pushed a the Lakers player, who already has a drug addict history, into choosing women who would take him down a bad path, the source informed. Though, the 2 hookers, who cavorted with Odom, are on suspension after allegedly lying to management about possible drug use in his room.
