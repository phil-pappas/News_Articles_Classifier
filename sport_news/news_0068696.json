Judging by Mark Stoops and Shannon Dawson’s remarks this afternoon, everyone’s moved on from what happened and Boom is “back in good standing.” \n“He’s back in good standing,” Stoops said. “He’s there. He was back for the Eastern game, he was back a few days and ever since then, he’s been back 100% and good to go.” \nIt was good to see Boom cheering his teammates on on the sidelines during the Eastern game, something Stoops said gives him hope that the sophomore has learned from the experience. \n“I hope so. I believe so. That’s part of us building our program and growing and bringing along some young guys still. Just because we’ve talked about them for a year and a half means they’re grown yet. We have a lot of kids in that situation that we’re still trying to bring along. You know how we feel about playing in this league and competing at a high level. You better have some grown men. You’ve be grown, you’ve gotta be mature, and you’ve gotta have some depth.” \nDawson said he’s also pleased with Boom’s attitude in practice. \n“He’s doing great. He’s got great energy, great attitude right now. Obviously we’re a better team with him on the field. I think he understands that and I think we understand that. We want him to be on the field as much as possible. We’re a lot better with him out there.” \nWelcome back, Boom.
