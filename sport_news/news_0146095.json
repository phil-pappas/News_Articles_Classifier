The film, titled The Lies We Tell, features an almost entirely British cast, barring Om Puri who plays a Pakistani character. Interestingly, while he is not allowed to talk about the film, Santosh admits that the project stars Keitel and Byrne. “It is surreal to be working with these two. Harvey is a legend. So is Gabriel Byrne. They are down-to-earth and great fun to work with.”\nPehle Bhi!\nThis won’t be the first film where Harvey has been directed by an Indian. He acted in Against Itself, helmed by Kranti Kanade, in which Keitel played a Christian missionary. The film never saw an Indian release.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:41:24.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
