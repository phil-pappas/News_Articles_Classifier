The Grizzlies took a 2-1 lead into the half against North Eugene, fell behind 3-2, then tied the game on Calysta Susu-Mago’s goal in the 66th minute and both teams were denied a game-winner over the next 14 minutes of regulation and 20 minutes of overtime in the 3-3 Midwestern League tie. The game was the first league match for both teams. Ashland is 5-0-4 overall heading into Tuesday’s home match against Crater, while North Eugene is now 4-2-2. “Both teams had some chances after (Susu-Mago’s goal),” Ashland coach Eric Wolff said. “It was a dog fight all game long — pretty physical play, too, but fair play. Both teams fought for it but it didn’t quite happen for either team.” Mya Elder-Hammond scored a goal and assisted on two others, including the equalizer, but Ashland had to settle for its fourth tie of the season. North Eugene’s Jordan Wormdahl and Brittany Smith scored six minutes apart to give the Highlanders a 3-2 lead with 22 minutes to go. Susu-Mago netted the equalizer on an assist by Elder-Hammond, who used some fancy dribbling to get to the top of the box, where she laid off a perfect pass for the hard-charging Susu-Mago. Elder-Hammond also assisted on Lilli Patton’s goal in the 22nd and connected on a free kick near the top of the penalty box in the 26th. On the assist to Patton, Elder-Hammond flicked it off her head and Patton finished into upper corner. Wolff said the Grizzlies will take plenty of positives away from the near miss. “The long drive makes a difference,” he said. “For us to go on the road with all the distractions in the media — and North Eugene is a very good team — for us to walk away with a tie is a great result.” Prep Volleyball Ashland started fast, was clutch at the finish and dominated everything in between en route to a 25-18, 25-17, 25-22 Midwestern League victory over Churchill on Thursday at Mountain Avenue Gym. Olivia Rooney had 13 kills, Myla Norvell 17 digs and Karlie Richardson 21 assists for the Grizzlies (12-4, 5-1 MWL), who won the first six points of the match and host Marist tonight in a key Midwestern League clash. Alex Crane added seven kills for Ashland, which extended its winning streak to six matches. “I think Churchill’s a good team and they had some good hitters,” Ashland coach Robin Akpan said. “We started out very strong and I think that gave us a little bit of momentum going into the rest of the match. “Last week we only had one match and we had no match Tuesday, so for us this was getting us back in the rhythm of playing full-speed volleyball.” Churchill fell to 5-8 and 3-3.
