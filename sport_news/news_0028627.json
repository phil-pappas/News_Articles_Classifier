But on the inside, he said, he was touched because for the first time in nearly two months, Scott was back on the football field.\nScott was suspended for three games earlier in the summer after the program was found to have violated the Virginia High School League's rule on recruiting.\nTwo games were added last month, after the school division concluded that he had violated the terms of the suspension.\nScott hasn't coached practice since the first week of August.\nHe hasn't coached a game since Dec. 13, when the Dolphins won the Group 6A state title.\n\"It's been a long offseason,\" he said. \"But knowing everything that you have to do to get people prepared makes that anxiety come back.\"\nThe Dolphins have done well in his absence.\nThey are 5-0 and have outscored their opponents 205-20. Ocean Lakes also is ranked in several national polls, including No. 10 by USA Today.\nBut all of the coaches and players know how important he is to the team.\n\"Today is very special,\" said standout defensive back Levonta Taylor, a Florida State commit. \"He's been going through some things and we're just happy to see him back. Now he gets to coach us and do what he loves to do. It feels good.\"\nScott, now in his eighth season, tried to get back into the flow of it but was interrupted several times by coaches who hugged him, shook his hand or yelled encouragement.\n\"I'm just really excited to be back with the boys,\" he said. \"The games are exciting... but it's all about the life teaching experiences and relationships. That's the stuff that you miss.\"\nFor the first 20 minutes of practice, Scott just observed.\nWith his arms folded behind his back, Scott watched as Chris Ramey, who served as the interim coach in his absence, gave instructions to the defense.\nAfter a break, Scott gathered the team together. As the coaches stood and the players took a knee, Scott told them how proud he was of them for stepping up when he was gone, like a family.\n\"We know it's not all about me... it's about filling in for each other,\" he said. \"I'm excited for them because of the job they've done and the success the young men have had. And Ramey has done a great job of keeping these guys together and making it right.\"\nThe Dolphins play at Kellam on Friday. It will be the first time Scott gets to see his son, CJ, play. CJ, a freshman, started the team's first five games.\nSenior linebacker Jordan Lauzon said having Scott back will only further motivate the Dolphins.\n\"It's just good to have our general back,\" he said. \"It's very hard to believe how long he's been gone but we're just happy he's back. It's just going to help us finish strong.\"\nLarry Rubama, 757-446-2273 or larry.rubama@pilotonline.com , Twitter: @LHRubama\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image.
