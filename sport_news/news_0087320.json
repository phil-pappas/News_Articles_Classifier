Chicago police covertly detained more than 7,000 people at a secret interrogation warehouse straight out of a Bond movie — more than double the amount of prisoners originally believed to be held and grilled there, according to a report.\nOf the 7,185 arrestees questioned at Homan Square between 2004 and 2015, only 68 were allowed access to legal counsel, the Guardian reported, citing internal police records.\nPrevious police records reported only 3,540 bookings over the past 11 years.\n“That place was and is scary. It’s a scary place. There’s nothing about it that resembles a police station. It comes from a Bond movie or something,” said attorney David Gaeger, whose client was detained at Homan in 2011 after a marijuana arrest.\nAt least 22 detainees told the Guardian that they were held for hours or days on end. Many were physically beaten during interrogations. Some were denied phone calls to their families.\nChicago lawyers said they are routinely turned away from the warehouse, a towering brick warehouse that features floodlights and a razor wire fence.\n“The reality is, no one knows where that person is at Homan Square,” Craig Futterman, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, told the newspaper. “They’re disappeared at that point.”\nOnly .94% of the more than 7,000 arrestees have seen their lawyers during interrogations. While that low figure is similar to data from other police detention centers, per the department’s practice of limiting attorney involvement during the first stages of questioning, lawyers said it’s impossible to even find their clients at Homan Square.\nScott Olson/Getty Images Chicago police allowed only 68 of the arrestees access to their attorneys. Booking records are notoriously shoddy and visitors never know where exactly the arrestees in the giant building are held.\n“If you’re laboring under the assumption that your client’s at Homan, there really isn’t much you can do as a lawyer. You’re shut out. It’s guarded like a military installation,” Gaeger said.\nAt least two of the 68 people were allegedly granted access to an attorney told the Guardian that they never saw their lawyers\nDespite its intimidating façade and the rumors of the brutal interrogations that happen inside, about 75% the arrestees taken to Homan were eventually charged with drug crimes — not more violent charges. About 35% of the drug charges were heroin-related, and another 22% were for marijuana.\nIt’s not clear how many people were detained at the facility but never charged.\nPolice have used Homan Square more and move over the years: About 65% of the arrests between August 2004 and June 2015 happened in the last five years, under Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel. Emanuel’s office has not commented on its role in the facility.\nRelated Stories Chicago police detain Americans in ‘black site': report Tags: Chicago", "external_links": ["http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/19/homan-square-chicago-police-disappeared-thousands"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:18:08.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
