It's begun building high-capacity in other cities on its possible expansion list, but not on the far West, where Portland and two other cities (San Jose and Phoenix) were left hanging.\nGoogle declined comment on the fiber huts. Mary Beth Henry, director of Portland's Office of Community Technology, cautioned the filings do not represent a \"firm commitment\" by the company.\nNonetheless, the applications are a clear sign it's actively planning a Portland network and preparing to begin construction.\nThe fiber huts are approximately 12 feet by 30 feet, and 9 feet high, according to applications submitted to the city on Google's behalf. Each would sit behind a 10-foot fence. (See pictures above of fiber huts in Google Fiber's first market, Kansas City.)\nThey house equipment for the network, a hub for thousands of fiber's passing from Google's main lines to smaller utility cabinets along city streets that will distribute Internet traffic to individual homes.\nThe land-use applications state the huts can service up to 40,000 homes apiece. That's double the number Google said they could handle last year, when Portland approved a framework agreement for the company to lease city property for the huts.\nThe seven proposed fiber huts are distributed across the city, from St. Johns to outer Southeast Portland, and suggest that Google is eyeing nearly every part of the city. It determines specific areas for service based on the number of households in a given neighborhood who sign up.\nA Kansas engineering company called BHC Rhodes submitted the applications on Google Fiber's behalf. The company has also done work for Google in other cities, including Austin, where Google Fiber is launching a network.\nGoogle Fiber offers Internet connections at 1 gigabit per second, 40 times faster than the current broadband standard. The company hopes faster Internet access will enable new online applications, and new businesses for Google to pursue.\nSince the company announced last year that Portland is a possible expansion city, Frontier Communications and CenturyLink have each begun offering their own gigabit service in parts of the Portland area and Comcast says it's planning its own gigabit service, too.\nGoogle charges $70 a month for gigabit connections, and another $65 for an accompanying cable TV service. That's in line with comparable services from established companies, though others often impose higher rates after an initial trial period.\nGoogle Fiber is also considering service in Gresham, Tigard, Lake Oswego, Beaverton, Hillsboro and parts of unincorporated Washington County.\nh/t @maccoinnich\n-- Mike Rogoway\nmrogoway@oregonian.com\n503-294-7699\n@rogoway", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/rogoway", "https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zsDHPN55X62c.kmh0dTUGmelc", "https://twitter.com/maccoinnich/status/650106427592151044", "https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bds/47126"], "published": "2015-10-05T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:38:24.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
