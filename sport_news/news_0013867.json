With most of the offensive line set up near the right sideline, Indy snapped the ball to Colt Anderson, who was immediately tackled for a 1-yard loss that gave the Patriots the ball at the Colts 35. \nSix plays later, Brady got free from the pass rush and hooked up with LeGarrette Blount for an 11-yard touchdown pass to give the Patriots a 34-21 lead early in the fourth quarter. \n\"The whole idea there was on fourth-and-3 or less, shift our alignment to where you either catch them misaligned, they try to sub some people in, catch them with 12 men on the field, and if you get a certain look, you can make a play,\" Colts coach Chuck Pagano said. \"Alignment-wise, we weren't lined up correctly, and then a communication problem on the snap. I take responsibility for that.\" \nIndy (3-3) never recovered. \nNew England has won seven straight over its longtime rival and is 5-0 for the first time since its 16-0 season in 2007. Advertisement \nBrady finished 23 of 37 in the first meeting since January's AFC title, which ultimately led to allegations of improperly inflated balls, months of investigation and eventually a four-game suspension that was nullified in court. Had the suspension been upheld, Brady would have made his season debut in front of a hostile Indianapolis crowd. \nColts quarterback Andrew Luck returned after missing two games with an injured right shoulder. Luck was 30 of 50 for 312 yards with three TDs. Unbeaten but unlucky Peyton Manning threw three interceptions but still became the first quarterback in NFL history to lead a team to a 6-0 start six times. Manning helped the Denver Broncos reach 6-0 with a 26-23 overtime win against the Browns in Cleveland. \n\"We're not playing as well as we would like, but we're playing well enough to win,\" Manning said. \"We're doing some things right at critical times, whether it's the last drive of the game or in overtime.\" \nManning can thank his defense for helping to keep the Broncos unbeaten. After Manning's third pick, Denver recorded a tackle behind the line of scrimmage and then had two consecutive sacks of Josh McCown to push the Browns out of field-goal range. \nManning, who has seven TD passes and 10 interceptions this season, said: \"I'm not having a ton of breaks. I won't be going to Vegas for my bye week. I'm not feeling really lucky.\" Injury updates First, Michael Vick went to the sideline after taking a knee to the helmet. Then he returned, with the Pittsburgh Steelers saying all that was wrong was a little dirt in his eye. \nAnd then Vick left the game again later, this time with what the team said was an injured right hamstring. \nAlready without starting quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, the Steelers beat the Cardinals 25-13 despite relying on third-string QB Landry Jones, who had never taken a regular-season snap but threw a pair of touchdown passes. \nOf more concern to the Steelers might be a different injury: Left tackle Kelvin Beachum is done for the season after tearing a ligament in his left knee. \nVick wasn't the only quarterback who took an ugly-looking shot and left, then returned. \nTitans rookie Marcus Mariota played while wearing a knee brace after a Dolphins defender rolled onto his left leg. And Houston's Brian Hoyer got sandwiched up high by Jacksonville's Johnathan Cyprien -- who was called for a late hit -- and Telvin Smith, missed one play, then finished leading the Texans to a 31-20 victory. Passports required With injuries mounting, the Buffalo Bills scrambled to find ready replacements. And, most important, they must have valid passports. \nAfter a 34-21 loss to Cincinnati, Bills general manager Doug Whaley began searching for free agents who might be available before the team leaves for London for Buffalo's game against Jacksonville at Wembley Stadium. \n\"Logistically, it's very tough,\" Whaley said. \"First of all, you've got to make sure they have a passport. So it's going to put us in a bind. We're going to go straight to work on that right now.\" \nReceiver Sammy Watkins did not return after twisting his left ankle while making a touchdown catch. Defensive tackle Kyle Williams was carted off after hurting his left knee in the final minutes. Receiver Marquise Goodwin did not return after hurting his ribs on a kickoff return. And right tackle Seantrel Henderson was being examined for a possible concussion. \nAnd that doesn't include Buffalo being forced to start backup quarterback EJ Manuel in place of Tyrod Taylor, who was sidelined by a left knee injury. Not worried about fine Steelers defensive end Cam Heyward is more concerned about paying tribute to his late father and those battling cancer than whatever fine the NFL might throw his way. \nHeyward wore eye black with \"Ironhead\" written on it for the second straight week after being fined for doing it a week earlier. \nHeyward's father, Craig Heyward, went by \"Ironhead\" during a standout college and pro career. He died after a long fight with cancer in 2006. \nThe NFL fined Cam Heyward $5,787 for displaying a personal message. Heyward said he'll continue to pay the fine, adding \"this is bigger than all we play for. There are people fighting for (their) lives.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:11:58.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
