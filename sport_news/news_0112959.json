Consider the opposing quarterback.\nNothing is more rock solid in the NFC East than the fact that Eli Manning starts at quarterback for the New York Giants. Two years before Tony Romo made his first start for Dallas, Manning took the field and, 173 regular season games later, he hasn't stopped showing up. And yet his presence week after week year after year guarantees the Giants what, exactly?\nManning is the interloper in the class of quarterbacks to have started for two Super Bowl winners. Seriously, tell me which one of these is not like the other.\nBart Starr. Roger Staubach. Bob Griese. Jim Plunkett. John Elway. Ben Roethlisberger. Eli Manning.\nIn their history, the Cowboys have faced plenty of NFC East quarterbacks who posed significant problems -- Randall Cunningham scrambling all over the place, Sonny Jurgensen picking defenses apart, Jim Hart leading the \"Cardiac Cards'' to unlikely victories, Phil Simms making plays in the cold of Giants Stadium.\nAnd yet Manning stands alone as a regular Cowboys foe who climbed the mountain twice. He hardly registers as the most formidable of opponents, and yet you can't say he doesn't belong on this list of dual Super Bowl winners because those playoff runs were impressive and those Super Bowl victories against Bill Belichick and Tom Brady were hard-earned. But they have virtually nothing to do with Sunday's game as two teams try to emerge from a rundown NFC East and find their way back to respectability.\nAlthough Manning and the Giants owned the Cowboys in their first four trips to the new stadium, the Cowboys now have a five-game winning streak against New York. With rookie Randy Gregory returning to the lineup one game after Greg Hardy made his Cowboys debut, you might say turning up the pressure on Manning serves as the key to this game. Certainly it's not without importance.\nBut mostly the Cowboys have gone about the business of beating the Giants the last three years by outscoring them. Averaging 29.8 points per game, Dallas has made the Giants defense the scapegoat during this losing streak, not so much Manning, who has 12 touchdown passes and four interceptions in the five games.\nActually Manning's career passer rating of 90.8 in 22 games against the Cowboys is higher than his overall numbers. But his 10-12 record against Dallas lowers his career winning percentage.\nNot knowing exactly what Cassel might give a hit-and-miss Dallas offense in his first start, we have to assume a greater burden than usual falls on the Cowboys defense. And as we know by now, this is not a defense that has stood tall during Romo's absence.\nBoth the Atlanta and New Orleans games were extremely winnable if the Cowboys simply made a fourth quarter stop. You can't say the same of the New England game, but the Patriots do that to a lot of folks these days.\nIf you want to find something even less predictable than the play of Cassel or Manning, it's the Cowboys' ability to secure a turnover from the Giants. This defense has gone more than 200 snaps since its last takeaway. At some point, the pressure that Hardy, Gregory and Tyrone Crawford figure to generate should force a turnover, correct?\nThat doesn't mean it happens today. The numbers crunchers at \"Pro Football Focus\" tell us that Manning hasn't thrown an interception under pressure this season.\nCertainly seems like it's worth a try, though.\nExperience -- those 173 consecutive starts against a year of idleness -- suggests the quarterback matchup could turn out to be a huge mismatch, but we don't know that yet. The Cowboys are equipped to run the ball better than New York no matter who's getting the carries. That can balance things a bit for Cassel. Injuries make the quality of available wide receivers an unknown.\nSo who knows? A little pressure on Manning might make the Super Bowl experience he brings to this game even less relevant than it already seems.\nTwitter: @TimCowlishaw.\nLatest Cowboys analysis\nSherrington: Kool-Aid drinker Jerry Jones hasn't learned important football lesson\nBob Sturm: Examining the 2016 NFL draft from the Cowboys' perspective\nSabin: Dez not being counted out, but several factors make return vs. NYG unlikely for Cowboys star WR\nLaufenberg: Is Michael the answer?
