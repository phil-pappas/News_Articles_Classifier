When asked how he incurred the cuts, the Bath flanker said: \"I'm not sure, I think it was at the bottom of a ruck\". \nStriking with the elbow - which falls under law 10.4a of dangerous play and misconduct - has a low end sanction of a two-week suspension. \nThe citing officer has up to 36 hours after the match has ended to lodge a complaint, setting 6am on Monday morning as the deadline.
