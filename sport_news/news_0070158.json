Orders that transcend the Sunni-Shiite divide are organised around a grand master and meet to perform specific rituals, which can include music, dance and trance.\nMalas and his two brothers -- Nehru and Gandhi -- were arrested in the late 1990s, allegedly for forging Saddam's signature, but were released and fled to Kurdistan, an autonomous region of northern Iraq.\nTheir father is believed to have once had close ties with Izzat al-Duri, who was Saddam's number two and is also a Sufi.\nThe highest-ranking former regime figure still officially on the run, Duri and his loyalists were allied with the Islamic State group in the early phase of the jihadist offensive in June 2014.\nThe Kasnazanis fell out with Saddam near the end of his reign and are reported to have played a key role in assisting the United States in planning the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nKasnazani is the highest-ranking official to be targeted by an arrest warrant since Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi promised a crackdown on graft in August.\nThe embattled premier, facing mounting popular discontent and large-scale protests, announced a number of measures aimed at curbing corruption and official privileges.\nThe trade minister is a political ally of Iyad Allawi, a politician who has been accused by the main Shiite bloc in government of abetting insurgent Sunni groups.\nAllawi held one of the three vice-president jobs Abadi scrapped as part of his reform package but the former interim prime minister is challenging the decision.\nMany of Abadi's measures have yet to be implemented.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:10:40.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
