INDEPENDENCE, Ohio — LeBron James said \"there's no room for guns\" as he decried the latest tragedy involving a child being killed in Cleveland.\nJames said he was at home with his three kids Thursday when he learned about the death of a 5-month-girl in a drive-by shooting — the third fatal shooting of a child in the city in four weeks — and \"it automatically hit me.\" James initially reacted with several posts on Twitter, calling for calm and change.\nAdChoices The NBA star, who has never shied away from political issues, spoke after practice Friday about the need for stricter national gun laws.\nJames didn't hear President Barack Obama's impassioned speech following the mass shooting at an Oregon community college campus, but \"I know what I see. I know how I feel.\"\nJames believes some of the educational work he does with his family's foundation can help curb violence.\n© AP Photo/Ron Schwane Cleveland Cavaliers' Lebron James, left, Kyrie Irving, center, and Kevin Love pose for a portrait during the NBA team's media day, Monday, Sept. 28, 2015, in Independence, Ohio.
