Two plays later Catholic quarterback Andre Sale hit Justin Temple in the flat and Temple broke a tackle and ran 31 yards for a touchdown as the Rockets took a 7-0 lead just 53 seconds into the game. \n\"We go out there and we're offsides on the opening kickoff,\" said Siloam Springs coach Bryan Ross. \"Then we give up a big run and missed a tackle, and before the game is a minute old it's 7-0. You don't know why. That's part of the game. If we knew why we'd keep it from happening.\" \nIt was a lead Catholic (3-4, 2-2) wouldn't relinquish. \nHarville-Thomas would go on to rush 25 times for 151 yards. He rushed for a 10-yard touchdown in the second quarter. Later in the second, he hauled in a 16-yard touchdown pass from Sale as Catholic pulled ahead 24-7 at halftime. \nSiloam Springs pulled within 24-14 in the third quarter, but Catholic answered in the fourth when Sale threw a back-shoulder 31-yard touchdown pass to Temple as the Rockets went ahead 31-14. \nSale went on to complete 9 of 18 passes for 151 yards and three touchdowns. Catholic finished with 345 yards of offense. \n\"They're pretty good defensively,\" said Catholic coach John Fogleman. \"The kids played hard. We don't have the points to show for it, but we did OK in the second half. We had a short field a couple of times and turned it over on downs, but we did OK.\" \nCatholic also overcame 14 penalties for 131 yards and the loss of senior receiver Zach Gee, who was carted off the field with a leg injury in the first half. \nSiloam Springs, meanwhile, was penalized 11 times for 100 yards. Some of those penalties were costly, too. \nThe Panthers were flagged for roughing the punter late in the first half, extending a Catholic drive which resulted in a touchdown. \nCoby Roach ran the second-half kickoff back 96 yards for a score but that play also came back because of a flag. \n\"More of the same,\" Ross said. \"It's pretty frustrating. I don't know what the answer is. Obviously the kids don't mean to, but you can't win football games when you make that many mistakes. We've made our share of them this year. We've just got to keep working and keep trying to teach. That's all you can do.\" \nThe Panthers had 304 yards of offense. Catholic limited Siloam Springs running back Ricky Hughes to just 65 yards on 12 carries. Hughes also lost a fumble on a pass play. Siloam Springs quarterback Jordan Norberg was 18 of 34 for 174 yards and two interceptions. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:00:46.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
