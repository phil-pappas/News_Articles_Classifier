Cross was the B’s second-round pick (35th-overall) in 2007. He was hampered for years by a knee injury suffered playing American Legion baseball in 2007. Cross has been a captain in prep school (Westmister), on BC's 2012 championship team and with the Providence Bruins this year.\nIn other Bruins news, winger Brad Marchand returned to practice just three days after suffering a concussion.\n“I feel pretty good,” Marchand said after skating and competing fairly hard in the quick practice in Wilmington while wearing a green non-contact jersey.\n“Now it’s just about trying to get back as fast as I can. You never know. These things are day-to-day: You can feel good for a few days and then take a step back.\n“But I’m happy with how I feel. Hopefully I don’t have any setback.\nWhatever the doctors tell me to do, I’m going to do what they say.”\nMarchand is likely to miss the game against the Avs, and hopefully return Saturday night against the Coyotes in Phoenix.\nMarchand was hurt when his head crashed into the elbow of Canadiens winger Dale Weise.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:40:35.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
