Myers rushed for 191 yards and a touchdown in the Aggies' 33-18 victory. ( Eli Lucero / THE HERALD JOURNAL ) \nUSU 33, CSU 18 \nWhat went right — The Rams had a lead early in the second quarter and seemed to have found a way to move the ball against Utah State. It just didn't last after that 10-point burst. \nWhat went wrong — Two more turnovers meant the Rams lost the turnover battle for the fourth time this season, and the Rams gave up more than 150 yards on the ground to USU QB Kent Myers. \nWho played well — Stevens gave the Rams hope, throwing for one touchdown and rushing for another and throwing for 255 yards against a consistent rush he had to sidestep. Higgins produced his third straight game with at least 100 yards receiving, grabbing 10 balls for 114 yards and a TD. \nLOGAN, Utah — Colorado State fans are going to need to buckle up this season. And grab some antacids, too. \nIf that wasn't an obvious plan of attack for watching the Rams after four weeks, the first week of Mountain West play cemented it. \nSo far, the Rams have been a team that has shown glimpses, but nothing sustained for long periods of time. There was a brief period early in Saturday's game where one had to wonder if CSU's offense had figured out Utah State's defense. \nTwo drives produced 10 points and a lead. The Rams — who didn't score in their last visit to Maverik Stadium — scored twice in 4:20, getting a field goal first, then took advantage of a good punt return from Joe Hansley to set up a scoring pass from Nick Stevens to Rashard Higgins. \nAs it turned out, it was just brief, leading to a 33-18 loss. \nBut that wasn't the real problem. As it turns out, the Rams still haven't found a way to play a complete game five weeks into the season, a 60-minute contest (or sometimes, more) where they don't make so many mistakes of various kinds to give themselves a legitimate chance to win. \n\"That was pretty evident,\" CSU coach Mike Bobo said. \"You go on the road and you make that many mistakes, you're not going to have a chance to win the ball game. I thought we came out in the second half and played with more energy and effort, but we weren't playing with enough energy and effort in the first half.\" \nColorado State spent the rest of it's Mountain West opener missing chances and chasing Utah State quarterback Kent Myers with little success, dropping the team to 2-3 overall at the start of its hardest and most crucial three-game stretch of the season. \nEven in his first matchup with the Aggies (2-2), Bobo knew one thing was clear, and that was the Rams had to take advantage of the few opportunities the Utah State defense would provide. It just didn't happen. \nColorado State put together a drive at the end of the first half, but on third-and-9 from, Stevens avoided the rush of linebacker Kyler Fackrell and threaded a ball to Bisi Johnson, who dropped it at the USU 12. \nIn the third quarter, trailing 23-10, the Rams put together another drive, but as Dalyn Dawkins fought for yards inside the USU 20, he fumbled and the Aggies recovered. \nEven getting the ball first in the second half didn't help, because two plays after a 32-minute lightning delay, Stevens was sacked, fumbled and Fackrell recovered, giving the Aggies the ball at the CSU 8. \nThere was more. Penalties hurt the Rams, either by stalling the offense or helping Utah State extend drives. The defense bent all night, but often stiffened at the end to limit the Aggies to field goals, four in all, three by Brock Warren. \n\"I think there's a lot of kind of just shooting ourselves in the foot with penalties, missed opportunities missed assignments here and there by one person,\" said Stevens, who was 21-of-46 on the night for 252 yards a touchdown and an interception on his final throw. \"It wasn't the whole team the whole time, we'd just take our turns missing a throw or doing our own individual mistakes, and that's what kind of killed us. On top of those penalties, it's hard to keep drives alive and stop them when we have so many penalties.\" \nIn all, the Rams were flagged 12 times for 110 yards. The Aggies were flagged just as often for even more yards (125), but found a way out. \nNamely Myers. Playing quarterback in place of injured starter Chuckie Keeton, burned the Rams with his legs in the first half, rushing for 124 yards in the first two quarters to break the school's single-game rushing record for a quarterback. He would rush for 191 on the night, throw for 137 and account for two scores. \nBobo thought Utah State used the bye week to devise a good plan for him, and while CSU expected a lot of what came their way, Myers gashed them for some big runs as Utah State rushed for 298 yards in the game. \n\"We've got to have our communication down much better and know our assignments,\" CSU linebacker Kiel Robinson said. \"We just cant lose contain. We have to know who has quarterback, who has pitch man, who has zone read.\" \nJust when CSU gave its sideline some hope with a seven-play, 77-yard drive capped on a Stevens scramble for a 15-yard score on a fourth-down play — and the defense came up with a stop — CSU had three penalties on the ensuing drive, one a holding call that erased a Stevens' scramble for a first down. \n\"I get the sense we're all playing like freshmen,\" Bobo said. \"It's a lot to do with a new coaching staff. There's no carry over from the previous years, and you're making some mistakes that cost you ball games. You rep plays, rep them all week and it comes down to execution. \n\"It starts with me. I've got to do a better job of making sure that the plan we bring into the game we can execute. I've said that since Day One when I took the job, and obviously we're not executing the way we need to to be successful.\" \nThe first half produced more scoring than the entire game in Logan two years ago, and Utah State was on the board first with a 48-yard field goal by Jake Thompson, the first of his career. The drive was aided by two CSU mistakes — a pass interference call on Nick Januska, then Kevin Davis jumped offsides on Thompson's original kick of 53 yards, when it sailed wide left. \nThe Rams responded with 10 straight points, getting a 42-yard field goal by Wyatt Bryan in the first quarter, followed by a touchdown pass from Stevens to Higgins of 16 yards the following possession. \n\"We felt confident that we had some good plays and were going to be able to execute some things,\" Bobo said. \"We just didn't execute them the way we would have liked. You've got to give them credit for making plays. I thought we did a nice job in the second half and adjusting with a little bit of our passing game, but still we didn't protect enough. We hit the one explosive play to Xavier (Williams), but other than that, we missed some guys down the field.\" \nUtah State responded immediately as Myers lofted up a pass to the end zone, with Hunter Sharp playing the underthrown ball into a 42-yard touchdown to tie the game. \nMyers took the team 61 yards in four plays, with him rushing twice for a total of 60 yards, the second carry good for a 26-yard score and a 17-10 lead at the break. \nUtah State capped the game with a 33-yard touchdown run by LaJuan Hunt with 2:18 remaining.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T07:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T08:28:15.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
