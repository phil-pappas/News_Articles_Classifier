Last year the dynamic duo combined for 164 points, more than any pair of teammates in the NHL.\nThe Panthers top two scorers, Jonathan Huberdeau and Jussi Jokinen, combined for 98 points.\nBenn, who has five goals and eight points in five games, led the league with 87 points last season. Seguin, who has three goals and eight points, had 77 points in 71 games last year. He missed 10 games after an illegal hit from Panthers defenseman Dmitry Kulikov.\n\"I've talked about it enough. Definitely sucked. Moved on,\" Seguin said.\nAfter being outshot 8-5 in the first period, Dallas had a 32-16 shot advantage the rest of the way. The Panthers hadn't allowed more than two goals until Saturday.\n\"We got a little [ticked] off and just started to play our game to a higher level, trying to make them play at our level,\" Benn said. \"We were trying to take over the game and we obviously did that.\"\nThe Panthers (3-2) are moving on to a three-game road trip where they'll face two more pairs of fantastic forwards. On Tuesday, they'll have to deal with Penguins superstars' Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin, two likely Hall of Famers who combined for 144 points last season. And they've added former Leafs goal machine Phil Kessel.\nThat said, Crosby (302 career goals) doesn't have a point in the first five games, matching the longest drought of his career. Malkin (270 career goals) has a goal in each of his past two games.\nThen it's off to the Windy City to play the Chicago Blackhawks, the defending Stanley Cup champs, and their perennial All-Star forwards Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews, who combined for 130 points last season.\nOn Saturday they get another crack at the Stars' stars, Seguin and Benn.\n\"They're one of the best players in the league,\" said Panthers center Aleksander Barkov. \"They have great skill and are very fast. You have to be aware of them all the time on the ice.\"\nDallas is 4-1 and improved to 4-1-1 in their last six visits to Sunrise, dating back to March 1, 2007. Still, Stars coach Lindy Ruff praised the 3-2 Panthers.\n\"I think Florida's got a heck of a team,\" Ruff said. \"They're big, they're hard to get quality chances against. I thought the structure of their game was excellent and I said this morning it was going to be a tight game. It was.\"\nFaksa faces hero\nThe Stars placed forward Curtis McKenzie on injured reserve with a lower-body injury, so the Stars called up rookie forward Radek Faksa from the Texas Stars of the AHL.\nFaksa, 21, the 13th overall pick in 2012, made his NHL debut against the Panthers and his hero, fellow Czech, Jagr, who he never thought he'd play against.\n\"I'm excited for that because Jagr is basically my idol,\" Faksa said after morning skate Saturday. \"He's like my hockey god, so I'm very excited for that.\"\nFaksa played 11:38, and had one shot on goal, one hit, one blocked shot as well as going 3-for-3 on faceoffs.\n\"He played very well,\" Ruff said. \"He had a chance to score on his first shift of the game, he didn't quite get it all on a cross ice pass. I love the way he played and I love the way he competed. He didn't look nervous to me.\"\n Ice Hockey Florida Panthers Texas Stars Tyler Seguin NHL Pittsburgh Penguins Chicago Blackhawks", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56240a04/turbine/fl-florida-panthers-1019-20151018"], "published": "2015-10-18T22:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:56:59.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
