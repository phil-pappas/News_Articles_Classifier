When it got down to race time, the Portsmouth girls went back to featuring their current youth movement. The future looks bright for the Clippers, who saw star freshman tandem Ellen Baker and Sam Kelley-Derzon finish fifth and sixth, respectively, on their home course that starts and finishes on the track with a loop through the woods in between. Baker and Kelley-Derzon led a pack of Portsmouth runners — all of them sophomores — that swept spots 5 through 10. The Clippers finished second only to powerful Winnacunnet, which featured race winner Sarah DeMello, a senior, in 21 minutes, 11.4 seconds and a core pack of runners that swept the top four spots. Winnacunnet, which edged Portsmouth 21-35 in points, was missing three of its top runners. “We were outclassed by them, not to be surprised,” PHS coach Stan Lyford said of the Warriors. “They’re one of the top teams in the state.” Portsmouth saw seniors Elana Estabrook (22:40.2; 13) and Julia Adler (23:12.1; 15) place inside the top 15, with Estabrook finishing as her team’s final scorer. Carly Berman (23:27.6), Grace Gittell (23:44.7), Larkyn Baum (24:58), Ayden Ricker (25:54.1) and Sam Gutierrez (27:03.7) were the other Clipper seniors in the field. The Clippers featured 23 runners overall. Sixteen of them, including the top six, are underclassmen. Baker timed in at 21:54.4 with Kelley-Derzon following about 12 seconds later. “That’s pretty much what they’ve done all season long,” Lyford said of the freshman duo. “They’ve been switching back and forth (between first and second). They’re inexperienced. They’re only going to get better.” The Portsmouth boys got a fourth-place finish from sophomore Andrew Weeks (18:30.2) but settled for second overall as well to the Warriors, who featured race winner Morgan McGirl, a senior who broke the tape in 18:00.2. St. Thomas junior John Barry (18:01.1) was close behind for runner-up honors, creating a small gap between himself and third-place Cole Albert (18:16.6), a Winnacunnet senior. Winnacunnet won the boys meet over Portsmouth, 27-41, with St. Thomas settling for third (62). The boys and girls teams from Portsmouth are in a similar place entering the championship portion of their schedule — needing to dig deep at the Oct. 31 state meets to crack the top six and advance. “We’re always trying to shoot for the Meet of Champions,” Lyford said. “We’re usually close and never quite there. This is the year I was hoping we could do it.” Each team can field a seven-player roster for the state meet. Five of those Portsmouth runners, on the girls side, will be its top freshmen and sophomores, with Lyford selecting the final two. The Clippers’ top runners showed solid compression Tuesday. Sophomores Jenny Battye (22:22.2; 7), Sophia Hennessy (22:26.1; 8), Carly Walker (22:27; 9) and Skylar Raynes (22:31; 10) all cracked the top 10. Portsmouth’s top six were separated by about 40 seconds. “You’re always trying to get good grouping — and that’s extremely good grouping,” Lyford said. The coach guesses that group will have to be a full minute faster to challenge for the sixth spot in Division II. Meanwhile, the Warriors look poised to challenge for the top eight in Division I, which would clinch their own spot at the Meet of Champions. Sophomore McKenzy Wall was the runner-up in 21:36.2. Teammates Lindsey Baxter (21:37.6) and Molly Power (21:52.8), both seniors, finished third and fourth, respectively. Junior Jack Reaney was Portsmouth’s second finisher in 18:40.6, good for fifth overall, one spot behind teammate Weeks. Senior Josh Epstein was eighth in 18:59.6, and the team got other points from sophomore Hugh MacDonald (19:14.6; 11), junior Jason Madeira (19:39.6; 13), junior Jacob Walker (19:41.6; 15) and senior Nat Jenkins (19:42.3; 17). Portsmouth’s seniors at the meet included Davin Londoff (19:52.8), Tom Hall (20:08.9), Tim Rossi (21:35.7), Omercan Ersoydan (23:50.9), Robert Freeman (24:46.6) and Cal Govani (27:30). St. Thomas' top scorers on the boys side included sophomore Alexander Hyatt (19:05.4, 9) and senior Joseph Grinde (19:40.7; 14).
