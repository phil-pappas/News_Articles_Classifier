For Marco Estrada it was the most beautiful sound in the world. \nIt was a life-giving sound that generated a 5-1 victory over the Texas Rangers and kept Toronto’s playoff hopes alive for at least another 24 hours. They now trail the Rangers 2-1 in this best-of-five American League Division Series with Game 4 scheduled Monday afternoon at Globe Life Park. \nIt was Troy Tulowitzki who finally turned the key with a three-run home run in the top of the sixth to break open a tense, tight game. Until that point, the Jays had suffered through three consecutive innings where they had multiple baserunners but could only produce two runs. Tulowitzki came to the plate hitless in 11 at-bats in the series and would later single in the eighth inning for a two-hit night. \nMeanwhile Estrada pitched as well as anyone could have expected in such a pressure-packed environment. With his team’s season on the line, he held the powerful Texas lineup to three hits through six innings. Staked to that 5-0 lead, Estrada finally allowed back-to-back baserunners with one out in the seventh. Aaron Loup came out of the bullpen to face Rougned Odor and got a ground ball out, allowing a run to score. Mark Lowe then struck out catcher Robinson Chirinos to end the inning, leaving Josh Hamilton at third base. \nIn the first two games of this series, the Rangers’ pitching staff had stifled the Toronto offence with a flurry of breaking pitches. Martin Perez tried to execute a similar plan on Sunday but he was not nearly as precise as Yovani Gallardo and Cole Hamels were on Thursday and Friday. Despite allowing multiple baserunners, Perez was able to keep the damage to a minimum two runs by inducing double plays in each of the third, fourth, fifth and sixth innings. \nAaron Sanchez took out the the Rangers in order in the eighth inning and Roberto Osuna brought the four-run lead home in the ninth. \nDioner Navarro had Toronto’s first hit of the game, leading off the third inning with a ringing double over the head of centre fielder Delino DeShields. After Kevin Pillar’s single put runners at first and third, Ryan Goins hit into a double play executed by second baseman Rougned Odor, scoring Navarro. \nIn the fourth Josh Donaldson once again led off with a double. He went to third on Jose Bautista’s flyball out to centre. Texas manager Jeff Bannister, unwilling to let Edwin Encarnacion beat him, ordered an intentional walk that backfired when Perez completely lost the strike zone. After issuing the free pass, he walked Chris Colabello on four pitches, then Troy Tulowitzki on five pitches to force in a run. \nThe Rangers did finally get away relatively unscathed when Navarro grounded into an inning-ending double play but the Jays were up 2-0. \nOnce again the Blue Jays started the fifth inning with a man on second, when Pillar singled then took second base when centre fielder DeShields bobbled the ball. Goins sacrificed Pillar to third but the potential big inning once again died when, with the Rangers’ infield in, Revere broke his bat on a weak liner that Odor caught a couple of inches off the turf and then doubled up Pillar, who was running on contact. \nIn the sixth inning, for the fourth inning in a row, it looked as if the Rangers were going to escape a jam when they turned a bases-loaded double play, firs to home to first. \nBut Tulowitzki finally gave the Jays some much-needed breathing room when he came to the plate with runners on second and third and two outs. He battled reliever Chi Chi Gonzalez through a six-pitch at-bat before he broke out of his series-long slump by belting a three-run homer into the left field seats to make it a 5-0 game. \nMeanwhile Estrada was pitching a magnificent game in the most important start of his career. He gave up a two-out double to Hanser Alberto in the third inning, a one-out single to Josh Hamilton in the fifth and a one-out single to Delino DeShields in the sixth and then was driven from the game in the bottom of the seventh after back-to-back one-out singles by Elvis Andrus and Hamilton.
