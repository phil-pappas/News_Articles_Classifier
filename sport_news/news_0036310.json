Unless we curtail and replace carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and until we find the money to properly treat overgrown forests, we almost certainly face ever-increasing danger and destruction. But, when it comes to creating a safe and sustainable future for our county and our state and our country, there are a couple of “elephants in the living room” that must be addressed and overcome: 1) Deception, confusion, and denial about the growing concentration of CO2 and other greenhouse gasses in our atmosphere which cause global warming, and 2) Deception, confusion, and denial about the growing concentration of extreme wealth in the hands of a very few that deprives us from making needed infrastructure investments, like alternative energy sources and forest treatment to minimize wildfires and protect our watersheds. It is essential that we overcome these roadblocks and get needed political action at the federal level, and we should all press for it. For example, we need to price fossil fuels out of the market. CO2concentrations for hundreds of thousands of years have been around 285 parts per million (ppm). Starting in 1800, they grew to 399 ppm today — a 40 percent increase during those 215 years, mainly due to human activity. A revenue-neutral carbon tax would promote consumer decisions based on the true total cost of oil, gas, and coal. We also need much higher taxes on extreme wealth. With increased revenue, we can pay for not only forest treatment and restoration, but also for increased wage supplements to combat needless poverty, and for other infrastructure needs, such as free college tuition, road and highway maintenance, and so much more. Pope Francis pointed the way during his recent visit when he told us, “Climate change is a problem which can no longer be left to our future generations.” Let us all work together to press for increased governmental intervention for the common good.

With all this “gun control” talk, I haven’t heard one politician at either the state or national level say how they plan to take away guns from criminals and bad guys....just law abiding citizens who own guns.
