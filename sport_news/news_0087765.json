For the second time in three weeks, the Blue Devils will encounter that. This afternoon, it comes from Army’s version. “Seeing how they run a similar offense, we’re going to implement the same game plan,” Duke safety Jeremy Cash said. Cash excelled two weeks ago with a 12-tackle performance against Georgia Tech that resulted in weekly national recognition. “Going down and getting your nose in the heart of things,” Cash said of the approach. “When we play (against) a triple-option, I’m pretty much an outside linebacker.” Yet there is some caution in defending Army because not everything is the same. Army has more formations than Georgia Tech, based on what Duke players said they’ve learned. Blue Devils coach David Cutcliffe said Army’s unbalanced alignments can create havoc because defenses have to prove they can defend all of those. “It’s not going to be an easy game to just walk into,” Duke linebacker Dwayne Norman said. The familiarity could help the Blue Devils. But there’s another side to that as well because Army has had a chance to see how Duke nearly shutdown Georgia Tech’s rushing attack just two weeks ago. “That can work both ways,” Cutcliffe said. “It helps our players because they understand the challenge. … You’ve got to whip blocks and make tackles.” Duke players have been warned not to expect everything the same. They know Army’s discipline toward a task is one of the Cadets’ assets. “They’re a different opponent,” Norman said. “They’re not Georgia Tech.” Still, the Blue Devils anticipate a physical confrontation, perhaps much like they received last week with a run-oriented Boston College team. “Our team has to come off a physical game against Boston College and we have to get that mentality right back,” Cutcliffe said. Cutcliffe said the Blue Devils held some rugged practices during the week because there will be the ability to back off next week when the team doesn’t play. Duke has won its last six games in October. A victory today would give the Blue Devils a 5-1 record through six games in consecutive seasons, something that hasn’t happened for Duke’s football team since 1952-53. The Blue Devils said they’re not worried about historical footnotes at this stage because they don’t figure Army players are interested in that either. Page 2 of 2 - “They’re not going to care what our record is or what their record is,” Duke quarterback Thomas Sirk said.
