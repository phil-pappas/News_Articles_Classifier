(WYMT) -- No game for the Football Cats this week/weekend, so they treated Saturday as a Monday, practicing inside the Nutter Fieldhouse.Kentucky (4-1) hosts Auburn (3-2) inside Commonwealth Stadium Thursday, October 15. \nThe Wildcats have yet to win a game by more than one possession, including their most game -- a seven point overtime win over EKU. \n“Hopefully we'll learn from that game and all the close games we have had and be able to handle all the emotions of the game,” UK head coach Mark Stoops said Tuesday. “It'll be a fun atmosphere and we are excited about it.” \nNext, is Auburn -- a team that started in the Top 10, but is nowhere near there. The Tigers are unranked and broke a two game losing streak with a win over San Jose State last Saturday. \nJust like the Cats, Auburn had no game this week; just practice. \n“You need to address the things you are not doing well and we are just not playing very good in the front seven at this time,” first-year defensive coordinator Will Muschamp said. \nThe Tigers are giving up 25 points per game. \nBoom Williams will be back Thursday night after not playing against EKU due to an “off-the-field personal issue.” \n“It sucks not being able to go out there and help your team and knowing you could go out there and contribute in so many different ways and being able to help those guys,” the sophomore running back said. “But everybody in this building helped me and supported me get through what I needed to get through. And thanks to those guys, I don't think I would have been able to do it.” \nKentucky and Auburn is set for a 7:00 p.m. kickoff on ESPN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:10:18.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
