The Tigers play at River Valley tonight. (RYAN ABELLA/Miner) Shawn Byrne Miner Staff Reporter KINGMAN - It's only going to take the execution of a very simple game plan for the 0-5 Kingman Academy High Tigers to upset the defending Division IV state champions and 4-1 River Valley Dust Devils tonight in Mohave Valley.\"We can beat a team like this,\" said KAHS football Dan Stroup. \"But we have to be absolutely perfect, and they have to have one of their worst days.\"No coach ever wants to enter a game thinking his team doesn't have a chance. However, they can't sell their players a bill of goods either.\"The main thing is not necessarily a victory,\" Stroup said. \"It's about how the game is played out and, as a program, the things we want to accomplish.\"River Valley averages 33.2 points per game, and the Dust Devils come out firing. Last week against Kingman, River Valley put up 34 on the scoreboard in the first quarter. That has Stroup setting a goal of limiting them to a 14-0 lead after the first 12 minutes tonight.\"That would be a moral victory,\" he said. \"We're looking at our improvement and toward the teams we are going to play. We don't want to be the third team from Kingman to get blown out by them.\"The Dust Devils beat Kingman 59-0 and Lee Williams 51-0 already this season.Kingman Academy is prepared to be 0-6 when the final horn blares, but the Tigers are looking to take something away from this game and apply it immediately to next week's opponent - Lee Williams.\"The goal is to play them tough,\" Stroup said. \"They are the defending state champions, and they are very good. It will be hard.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:00:54.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
