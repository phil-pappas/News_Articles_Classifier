It also raised eyebrows. \n\"If it helps Argentina and Argentinian rugby then that is good, if not then I apologise,\" said Imhoff, who shares second place in the 2015 tournament try-scoring rankings with Bryan Habana, \n\"It is not an example to follow. The emotion got the better of me.\" \nImhoff, who will be one of the key players in Argentina's battle with Australia in the semi-finals on Sunday, claimed his dive was not the most spectacular of the game. But it certainly got the most attention. \n\"I was not thinking about anything when I ran to the line. I don't know what made me react like that,\" said the Argentine who plays for French club Racing 92. \n\"I said before the game that we must control our emotions, but at that moment I felt so much emotion that I couldn't.\" \n\"It's good on one side because it shows who I am. But it's also bad because I could not control myself.\" \nImhoff said the team had endured \"suffering\" to get ahead of the Irish in the quarter-final. \n\"That is why I was smiling, why I was so happy. The team was going through something beautiful.\" Copyright AFP (Agence France-Presse), 2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:52:52.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
