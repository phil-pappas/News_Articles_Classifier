Ultimately, the Middlesbrough side had too much for us. \n\"We're going to base our performances on today. We're going to address the situation in terms of the goals against column. \n\"Make sure we come out fighting against Birmingham, Bristol City and Burnley in our next three games and pick up as many of those nine points at possible. \n\"It is frustrating but we've got to be physically and mentally flat out at all times and we were today. \n\"I appreciate the three goals against is totally up - nine goals in three games means it's tough to get points and keep confidence. \n\"But from the game we'll take a lot of spirit, a lot of heart, performance level, effort, application, playing for the shirt, running and endurance. \n\"The formation change certainly helped us in terms of getting a foothold in the game. Ultimately we haven't got any points which is the bottom line, and the goals against record is too high.\" \nJackett had no complaints with the award of an 83rd minute penalty for a foul by Nathan Byrne on former Wolves man George Friend. \nBut he felt Middlesbrough could have had three players sent off - and that Wolves should have had a second-half penalty. \nBenik Afobe appeared to be brought down after James Henry's goalbound shot had been palmed in his direction. \nConor Coady was lucky to escape a red card after a late challenge while on a booking, but Jackett thinks Coady's first booking was the incorrect decision. \nHe said: \"I felt their penalty was one. Similarly, at the other end. There was a tackle from the wrong side (on Afobe). I did feel that was a penalty as well. \n\"I didn't think the first (Coady yellow card) was a booking, that was a harsh one.
