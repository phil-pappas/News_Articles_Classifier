The score this time was 28-21.\nThe Razorbacks saw a 21-13 lead disappear in the final three minutes, got a reprieve at the end of regulation with a missed A&M field goal, only to go away disappointed again after failing to match the Aggies' overtime touchdown pass.\n\"You really have to be hard on yourself and see what you are doing to put yourself in that position,\" Bielema said in his post-game news conference. \"One thing I know is we have guys with high amount of character.\"\nOn the eve of the game, the coach said he talked to the team about how he was tired of playing close games and getting pats on the back for playing close.\nThe Razorbacks are 0-9 under Bielema in games decided by fewer than 10 points. Winning games in the fourth quarter has understandably become an emphasis in Fayetteville.\n\"I've been at this for 10 years, and the difference is so small between winning and losing, a play or a player here and there,\" the coach said. \"For all those that wanted to see us win, I'm sorry. But I know today we got better.\"\nPenalties (11 for 93 yards) plagued the Razorbacks.\nRoughing-the-passer flags against Arkansas helped the Aggies sustain drives, while holding penalties on Arkansas stopped some promising possessions.\n\"You can't win football games doing that,\" Bielema said.\nFacing fourth-and-3 at the A&M 35, Bielema had made the decision to go for a first down, only to see another yellow flag spoil his plan. Arkansas led 21-13 with a little over four minutes remaining. But after a false start penalty, Arkansas punted.\nBielema said the plan was to go for the first down, not try and draw the Aggies offsides. \"We felt good about the play we had called,\" he said.\nHe said a 52-yard field goal was ruled out because of some recent kicking trouble from the left hash.\nArkansas' overtime chance ended on two incomplete passes by Brandon Allen. Before those two passes, Allen was 20 of 23 for 225 yards.\n\"BA did a lot of good things throughout the game,\" Bielema said. \"As we've lost guys on offense to injury, I think BA feels the weight of the world on him. We just need him to do his job.\"\nNo. 14 Texas A&M 28, Arkansas 21\nFull coverage Visit the Texas A&M page\nHairopoulos: Instant replay ... like in 2014, Aggies rally, top Arkansas in OT 28-21\nDeja blue: Arkansas' Bielema sees losing trend continue with another OT loss to A&M\nTexas A&M quick hits: Aggies post first sack vs. Arkansas this season; Razorbacks hog the ball\nFive thoughts: Red zone struggles for A&M, but freshman WR Kirk continues to impress\nPhotos: Hugs for Reveille; lots of tailgate action before Aggies rally to top Arkansas 28-21 in OT\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/26/hairopoulos-instant-replay-like-2014-aggies-rally-top-arkansas-ot-28-21", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/26/deja-blue-arkansas-bielema-sees-losing-trend-continue-another-ot-loss", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegephotos/2015/09/26/photos-hugs-reveille-lots-tailgate-action-aggies-rally-top-arkansas-28-21-ot", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texas-aggies", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/26/texas-quick-hits-aggies-post-first-sack-vs-arkansas-season-razorbacks-hog-ball", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/26/five-thoughts-14-texas-comes-behind-defeat-arkansas-razorbacks-28-21-overtime", "https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW"], "published": "2015-09-27T07:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:00:21.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
