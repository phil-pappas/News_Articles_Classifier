Though the rain dampened the atmosphere and field appearance, it did not do much to contain either offense, as the teams combined for 677 total yards of offense in the Eagles’ 42-20 victory. West Craven rushed for 371 yards, led by two 100-yard rushers in junior quarterback Darious Abrams (183 yards) and senior running back Danny Harvey (101). Abrams also passed for 55 yards and two touchdowns, while Harvey rushed for two and caught one touchdown. “No. 8 (Abrams) and No. 2 (Harvey) were huge for them and we struggled to stop them. No. 8 is a man among boys out there and No. 2 is a slasher, so it really puts pressure on defense going against them,” Swansboro coach Tim Laspada said. While Abrams and Harvey chewed up the ground, the Pirates were traveling by air. Swansboro senior quarterback Eli Frantz threw for 249 yards and three touchdowns, but the Pirates only managed two rushing yards on the Eagles. Markuise Hemby caught nine balls for 117 yards and two scores. Both teams took care of the football relatively well considering the awful conditions as West Craven lost three fumbles and Swansboro tossed two interceptions. One of those picks was returned 75 yards by Malik Abrams for a touchdown, keeping the Eagles’ streak of scoring at least one touchdown on defense in every game this season. Malik Abrams also caught a touchdown pass from his younger brother. “In a game like this, you’d think the run game is all you have, but hats off to Swansboro, they have a great passing team and the weather didn’t affect them,” West Craven coach Matt Riggsbee said. “Any time you play two games in four days is extremely tough, you are battling through nagging injuries and the kids have a great will to win and to fix problems.” The Eagles improve to 6-0 on the year (2-0 in the Coastal 3A Conference) and have a Craven County and intra-conference clash with fellow undefeated Havelock on the horizon next week. Harvey, a former backup quarterback and defensive back who switched exclusively to running back for this season, said he did have to adapt to the field. “I was thinking just keep driving forward, don’t worry about the field and what’s to the left or right, just forward,” Harvey said. “I had to keep my footwork and cuts and jukes more limited.” In addition to Abrams’ pick-6, Jashon Roundtree had an interception and Jayson McDonald blocked a punt to spur the defense. Page 2 of 2 - About the only negative spot for West Craven, which was without kicker Hunter Games who was injured, was that they went 0-for-7 in extra point attempts. Swansboro falls to 4-3 (1-1) and they are off next week and take on Richlands in two weeks.
