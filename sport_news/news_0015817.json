(AP) — Carson Royal threw three TD passes, Akil Blount returned an interception 75 yards for a score and Florida A&M beat Delaware State 41-13 on Saturday for its first win of the season. \nOff to its worst start in school history, the Rattlers (1-6, 1-3 Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference) struck first on Royal’s 18-yard pass to Kareem Smith, then led 14-7 after Royal hit Jairockeis Jones on a 76-yard scoring strike. \nRoyal was 14 of 31 for 229 yards with a 7-yard scoring pass to Desmond Noird in the fourth quarter. \nThe Rattlers settled for field goals twice after the Hornets defense stiffened in the red zone. \nJamaal Jackson scored on runs of 5 and 16 yards for the Hornets (0-6, 0-3), who were held to 90 yards rushing. Gil Rivera, starting in place of injured Esayah Obado, was 23 of 39 for 198 yards with three interceptions and two fumbles.
