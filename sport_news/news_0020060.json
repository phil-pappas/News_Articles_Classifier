Behind head coach Nick Romanak, the Clifton girls volleyball team has been surging as of late, winning seven straight as of press time and looking ready to make a run for the county title. Buy this photo Photo/Brian Hester Alison Moran of Clifton serves up an ace against Passaic High School this past Tuesday night. Clifton won 25-2, 25-10. \n\"We've been playing well lately,\" said Romanak. \n\"Saturday against Old Bridge was probably the most consistent and composed we've looked all season. Against Fair Lawn, it looked like we might revert to inconsistency, but we got it together. I am happy with how we are performing.\" \nThe Mustangs (14-4) swept a quad Saturday involving the Knights, Cutters and Newark East Side, demonstrating toughness and resiliency in three very distinct matches. \nThey won competitively against Old Bridge, while steamrolling Newark East Side. After falling in the first game against Fair Lawn, the Mustangs rallied to win 16-25, 27-25, 25-14. \nParticularly productive for Clifton has been sophomore outside hitter Kristen Kakascik. \nWith a strong armswing and powerful serve, Kakascik has emerged as a top-flight offensive weapon. \n\"I think we are just trying to get her the ball more,\" said Romanak. \"She is seeing more and more what she is capable of. The confidence she is gaining is going a long way.\" \nThe Mustangs host Hawthorne tomorrow at 10 a.m. in the quarterfinals of the Passaic County Tournament.
