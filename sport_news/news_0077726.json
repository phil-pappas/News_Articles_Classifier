Eagles break even with win over county foe Fort Calhoun Tyler Dahlgren Buy Now Joe Burns \nJunior Andy Theiler, who scored a pair of touchdowns on offense, stretches out to deflect this pass from Fort Calhoun quarterback Riley Grosse-Rhode to receiver August Namuth. Buy Now Joe Burns \nFort Calhoun senior August Namuth hauls in one of seven catches in a loss to Arlington on Friday night. Namuth would race to the end zone for a touchdown. Buy Now Joe Burns \nJunior Garris Karr scored two touchdowns and carried the ball 43 times for 157 yards in a 26-13 win over Fort Calhoun on Friday night in Arlington. \nThe Arlington football team has found an identity. \nThat identity is one of a smash mouth football team, and it has helped breed a three game win streak, including a 26-13 bruising defeat of county rival Fort Calhoun in a physical affair on Friday night. \nThat identity has been formed thanks in large part to junior running back Garris Karr, who put together another determined performance against the Pioneers. Karr carried the ball 43 times relentlessly into a Pioneer front that knew he was coming. He grinded out 157 yards and scored a pair of touchdowns. \nMeanwhile, the Arlington defense stymied Fort Calhoun's ground attack and turned them one-dimensional. The Pioneers finished the game with 234 of their 241 total yards coming through the air, a testament to the Eagles' defensive lines' ability to clog gaps. \n“Arlington did a nice job up front,” Fort Calhoun head coach Andy Christensen said. “They controlled the line of scrimmage and took away our run lanes in the first half.” \nArlington coach Steven Gubbels also tipped his hat to the Eagles in both trenches. \n“We really executed all three phases of the game very well,” Gubbels said. “I thought we did a good job of controlling the line of scrimmage on both offense and defense.” \nIn that first half, Arlington scored three touchdowns to take a commanding 20-7 lead into the break. The Pioneers' touchdown came from senior receiver Ben Namuth, who had five catches for 116 yards (including the 73-yarder). August Namuth led the team with seven grabs for 85 yards and scored the Pioneers' second-half touchdown. \n“Riley Grosse-Rhode came in at quarterback and did a nice job throwing the football around,” Christensen said of the senior, who missed a few weeks with an injury. “That gave our offense a big boost as we were able to move the ball more effectively.” \nThe two teams battled in the second half, as Karr carried for tough yards in three, four and five yard increments. \n“We did a better job tackling on first contact and attacking gaps,” Christensen said of the second half, when the Pioneers were able to limit the Eagles to just six points. “Unfortunately, when we would get some stops in the run game we gave up big plays in the air on third and long situations.” \nEagles' quarterback Andy Theiler only threw the ball nine times, but his five completions went for 81 yards. Ethan Gubbels had a 29-yard catch and Grant Miller hauled in a pass for 25 yards. \nTheiler also carried the ball 17 times for 46 yards and scored the Eagles' other two touchdowns. Sam Plugge had five carries for 10 yards. \nArlington out-gained Fort Calhoun 298-241, as both defenses were relatively stout. Jacob Miller, a senior defensive-lineman, had 10 tackles to lead the Eagles, while sophomore Caleb Caskey registered seven. \nBen Namuth and Jacob Tegels each amassed 18 tackles, drawing rave reviews from Christensen. Namuth set the school record for tackles last Friday in a loss to Boys Town. Senior Cole Welchert added 11 stops and junior Joe Twomey had 10 stops, including one for a loss. \n“Our message has been consistent from day one,” Gubbels said. “At the end of every day we need to be able to say that we got better at something and as those days ass up through the season, good things will happen.” \nArlington, now 4-4 overall and 3-1 in their district, will wrap up the regular season by hosting Class C No. 2 Boys Town. The Cowboys moved to 4-0 in district play with a 42-41 win over Ashland-Greenwood. \n“Boys Town has a lot of talent on the field with a lot of big play potential,” Gubbels said. “Defensively, we will need to try to limit their big plays on offense while offensively, we need to control the pace of the game with our running attack, keeping their offense off the field.” \nFort Calhoun, which falls to 3-5, is also at home next Friday, as Concordia comes to town for a 7 p.m. kick. \n“Execution is key for Friday night's game,” Christensen said. “We need to reestablish the run game and play our brand of football.” \nArlington 26 Fort Calhoun 13 \nFort Calhoun (3-5) 0 7 0 6 13 \nArlington (4-4) 7 13 0 6 20 ×", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T05:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:04:23.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
