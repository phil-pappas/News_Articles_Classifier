He's the only one to go over 500 yards in total offense three times. No other QB has done it more than once.\nThe TCU quarterback's latest 500-yard game came in Saturday's 45-21 win over Iowa State.\nHe now owns three of the top nine single-game totals this season. His 527 yards against Texas Tech ranks No. 5, his 510 against Iowa State is No. 7 and his 504 against SMU is No. 9.\nBoykin's average of 425.6 yards ranks second to Bowling Green QB Matt Johnson's 428.3.\nThe senior from Dallas has recorded seven of the top 10 total-offense games in TCU history.\n———\nTCU quarterback Trevone Boykin walks off the field after his team's 45-21 victory over Iowa State in an NCAA college football game, Saturday, Oct. 17, 2015, in Ames, Iowa.

He rushed for a school-record 243 yards, caught a pass for 4 yards and had 122 kick return yards, with 96 coming on a first-quarter return that ended with him brought down at the UCLA 4. The son of former NFL receiver Ed McCaffrey leads the FBS with 253 all-purpose yards per game.\nBALL-HAWKING AGGIES: Utah State had eight takeaways in its 52-26 win over then-No. 21 Boise State and rose to fourth nationally in turnover margin at plus-1.5 per game. The eight takeaways were the Aggies' most in a game since at least 1993, according to the school. Utah State has at least three takeaways in four straight games and 95 in its last 43 games.", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site333/2015/1019/20151019__FBCStatWatch~p2_200.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T20:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:26:12.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
