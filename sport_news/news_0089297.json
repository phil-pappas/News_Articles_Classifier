It is a work in progress and it will take a while before he is comfortable with it.”\nThe two were together for about five days in Vegas this summer and now Sikma is back with Valanciunas in Vancouver for training camp. It’s not a ton of time together, but he is seeing incremental progress.\nSikma and the Raptors aren’t overloading their young centre. In fact it sounds like they are purposefully keeping things as one-dimensional as possible.\n“The priority is to try to get him more comfortable shooting face-up shots and recognizing situations when that can happen,” Sikma said. “We really haven’t gone to much else. If you do you really take the focus away from doing this. We are just staying right there.”\nSikma is confident Valanciunas can develop this part of his game and use it to expand his effectiveness. It’s just a matter of making it comfortable for the Lithuanian big man.\n“He’s a decent shooter,” Sikma said of Valanciunas. “All you have to do is look at his free throw shooting percentages. He’s got good touch. There’s nothing wrong with that shot. It’s just how he learned to play and that was with his back to the basket. He’s always been big and the expansion of it is facing up and trying to take a little pressure off and it’s going to take a while. When I say a while it’s not like a month. This is going to be a long-term commitment.”\nThe two developed a bond in Vegas this summer in Vegas and in Sikma’s opinion work well together.\n“We have connected pretty well,” he said. “I trust he will do the work and he trusts I can get him to where he wants to be. That came pretty fast this summer.”\nROSS A SEASON LATER\nThere’s no question Terrence Ross didn’t have the season he wanted a year ago or the one management wanted out of him.\nThe three-and-D specialist was not the factor he was expected to be, but as we now know, there was a reason for that.\nRoss had off-season surgery on his left ankle and is just now getting back to full strength.\nThe ankle, though, was bothering him for most of the second half of last season.\n“It was frustrating,” he said. “I would roll my ankle and go in the back and work on it, it would feel a little better, then I’d go right back out and roll my ankle again, so it was more just like physically taxing, it just kind of took a toll on me at the end of the year, so they decided it would be good idea to get done with now so I don’t have any long-term problems,” Ross said.\nEarly in training camp, Ross is already feeling the difference after some bone spurs were cleaned up.\n“Aw, right now it feels all better,” Ross said Friday. “I used to have this weird clicking in my ankle. I don’t have that any more. When I wake up, it doesn’t hurt, it doesn’t ache, I don’t have to take my time getting out of bed.”\nThere is one tell-tale reminder of the operation but Ross can live with it.\n“Big nasty scar on my ankle, but other than that, it’s not bad,” Ross said.\nRoss’ role changes this year with the addition of DeMarre Carroll. He will be coming off the bench and providing a three-point threat, not to mention a defensive presence as opposed to his starting role which he had for most of last year.\n“I think it will help, it helps in a lot of ways,” Ross said of the move. “Bringing scoring in off the bench, and it brings defence in off the bench, so it’s kind of a win win for everybody.”\nQUICK HITS\nThe Raptors pre-season broadcast schedule is out and the only game fans will not be able to see is Monday’s game in San Jose, Calif., when the Raptors take on Golden State. Tomorrow’s game in Vancouver against the Clippers will be on TSN2, while Thursday’s game in Ontario, Calif., will be televised on NBATV Canada. The same broadcaster has the game a week from Monday at the ACC when Andrew Wiggins and the Timberwovlves visit Toronto. TSN2 jumps back into the game with the Oct 14th game in Ottawa against Minnesota. NBATV Canada has the Oct. 18th game at the ACC against Cleveland and then TSN2 finishes up the preseason with the Oct 23rd game in Montreal against Washington … Ross on what he had did this summer. “Well, rehabbing but I did a lot of ball-handling drills, I did my best to get bigger, stronger,” he said. “So it’s a lot easier for me getting to the basket.” … Carroll on his new teammates: “A lot of these guys are like college guys,” he said. “We’ve got a young team so it’s easy for these guys to get along … besides Luis Scola. He’s the only granddaddy on the team, but at the same time we are learning each other and learning our tendencies. We just have to keep moving and getting better.”\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nValanciunas working hard with Sikma on face-up game\nBy Mike Ganter , Toronto Sun First posted: Friday, October 02, 2015 09:55 PM EDT | Updated: Friday, October 02, 2015 10:00 PM EDT\nJack Sikma knows exactly what he is asking of Jonas Valanciunas.\nAnd because he knows what he’s asking and how difficult it is, he’s pleading for patience for the young centre.\nIn short Sikma, a veteran of 14 NBA seasons including an NBA title in 1979, is taking a guy who has used a back-to-the-basket game to get to where he is today and he’s asking him, or more precisely the team is asking him, to get equally comfortable with a face-up game.\nAs Sikma says, anyone expecting this transition to be quick is probably asking too much.\n“I just know from learning the face-up from the post and learning moves, it takes a long time and you just have to stay with it,” he said. “It’s important to continually remind him when there are opportunities to do it, he needs to do it, particularly in camp and practice time.
