Satterwhite returned the opening kickoff 82 yards for a touchdown to open the third quarter. \nPebblebrook nearly answered on the ensuing kickoff, returning it to the Cougars’ 44. \nFrom there, the Falcons’ Wing-T offense put together one of its best drives of the night. \nQuarterback Jacobe Burke connected on a couple of passes and running back Tre Wright helped moved the ball to the goal line, but the Cougars defense came up with a goal line stand, stopping four straight quarterback sneaks just inches from a touchdown. \n“It’s a tricky offense, McDonald said of the Falcons. “They weren’t able to do too much in the first half, but they got rolling a little bit in the second.” \nAfter possession returned to Newnan on downs, the Cougars moved the ball to its own end zone on two long quarterback keepers from Chancellor Johnson. \nPebblebrook cut the lead to 20-7 with 9:49 left in the fourth quarter when Ganni Montgomery converted a fourth-down play into an eight-yard TD. \nMartavious Parks added the final scored for Newnan on a 24-yard touchdown with 6:30 left in the game. \nPebblebrook added its final score of the game when Montgomery caught a 26-yard touchdown pass. \nPebblebrook drove the ball deep into Newnan territory on the opening series of the game, but Newnan defensive end Dezmand Pleasant recovered the fumble to end the drive. \nNeither team was able to score in the first quarter, but the Cougars finally got their offense clicking just seconds into the second quarter when Marquis Hill scored on a 40-yard run. \nThe Cougars have won four out of their last five games while scoring at least 20 or more points. \nThe Cougars head into next Friday’s rivalry trying to break a two-game losing streak against the Indians. \n“We know both East Coweta and Langston Hughes are are going to be a big challenge for us,” McDonald said. \nCOUGARS 27, FALCONS 14 \nPebblebrook 0 0 0 14 — 14 \n2nd quarter N—Marquis Hill 40 run (Rad \nWyrick Kick), 11:50 N—Chancellor Johnson 4 shuffle pass to Darryel Hines (kick failed), 6:42 \n3rd Quarter \nN—KD Satterwhite 82 yard kick return (Wyrick kick), 11:50 \n4th Quarter \nP—Ganni Montgomery 8-yard run (kick good), 9:49 N—Martavious Parks 24 yard run (Wyrick kick), 6:30 P—Montgomery 26 touchdown pass from Burke 3:24 More", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:08:08.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
