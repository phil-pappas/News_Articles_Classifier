It marked the second consecutive week that North Little Rock has made a game-winning drive on its final possession. \n\"The offensive line came together and pushed through for us,\" Day said. \"That last drive was in their hands. It allowed me to carry the load.\" \nDay ran 11 times for 88 yards in the first half. \n\"Maybe we didn't give him the ball enough early in the game,\" North Little Rock Coach Jamie Mitchell said. \"But you know, when we need it, he's getting it. You can put that in print and tell everybody we're playing. It's no secret. He's carrying the ball.\" \nSearcy senior Luke Dixon ran 31 times for 162 yards and scored on runs of 1 and 14 yards. Senior quarterback Andrew Neaville also scored twice for Searcy, getting TD runs of 1 and 7 yards. Searcy finished with 346 total yards. \nSearcy (5-2, 2-2) dominated time of possession for the first three quarters and the Lions led 28-14 with 3:45 left in the third quarter. But Lions ran 13 plays for 45 yards and 1 first down the remainder of the contest. \nNorth Little Rock (3-4, 3-1) scored twice in the first five minutes of the fourth quarter to tie the game at 28-28. Day scored from 13 yards out with 11:10 to play to cap a 12-play, 68-yard drive. Senior quarterback Corvasea Cooney scored on his second 1-yard run with 7:25 left to end a six-play, 67-yard drive. \nSenior defensive back Garrett Lawson started North Little Rock's final drive with an interception with 3:09 to play. But the drive did not get off to a good start. \nThe Charging Wildcats were limited to 1 yard on its first two plays, forcing Cooney to go to the air. Cooney was 2 for 10 for 5 yards before the drive started, but the 6-3 senior found wide receiver Kyleal Lewis in the middle of the field for a 33-yard gain to the Searcy 35. \n\"He's is the only senior receiver we've got and we believe in him,\" Mitchell said of Lewis, who had a pass from Cooney slip through his hands on the Wildcats' previous drive. \"When we need a big play, that's generally where we're going to go to. It was just a great job by him.\" \nDay did the rest, running the next eight plays. \nSearcy thought it had a break on North Little Rock's next-to-last play. From the 5, Day ran through the middle and dove for the end zone, but Searcy caused a fumble. The Lions' defensive players were running off the field before they realized a flag had been thrown. Searcy had been charged for grabbing Day's face mask. \n\"I felt someone's hand in my helmet,\" Day said. \"I wasn't sure that it would be called, but my knee was already down. It never should have been a fumble.\" \nNorth Little Rock scored twice in the first quarter despite having the ball for only 1:45 of the quarter. Cooney scored on a 1-yard run to cap a 7-play, 41-yard drive. Deante Montgomery returned a kickoff 88 yards for a touchdown with 3:24 left in the quarter. \nNorth Little Rock compiled 395 total yards with all but 40 of them coming on the ground. Junior Darius Austin also topped the 100-yard mark, gaining 113 yards on 10 carries. Austin had a 54-yard run that set up the Charging Wildcats' second touchdown of the fourth quarter. Charing Wildcats kicker Savana Melton was good on all five of her extra-point attempts. Searcy kicker Kolton Howe was also perfect on extra points, going 4 for 4. \nJONESBORO 42, WEST MEMPHIS 24 \nJONESBORO — Jonesboro responded to an early 16-7 deficit with 35 unanswered points and turned back West Memphis. The Hurricane (5-2, 3-1 7A/6A-East) attacked West Memphis (3-4, 1-3) on the ground. Jonesboro came into the game with over 2,000 passing yards, but ripped through the Blue Devils defense for 308 yards rushing, led by senior Kylon Tate, who gained 167 yards on 15 carries. \nMARION 49, MOUNTAIN HOME 14 \nMOUNTAIN HOME — Marion posted 426 yards of total offense in the first half to claim a 42-6 lead at the break before coasting to a victory over Mountain Home. Marion (4-3, 1-3 7A/6A-East) scored on its first five possessions and got three total rushing touchdowns from sophomore Jacob Green. Darius Lathan added two rushing touchdowns. \nSports on 10/17/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:08:08.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
