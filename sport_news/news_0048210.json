(AP) - Early interest in the Green Bay Packers’ proposal for an entertainment, retail and residential district around Lambeau Field has the franchise already thinking of expanding its plans. \nThe Packers recently announced plans to develop the Titletown District on 34 acres around the stadium, including 30 to 50 townhouses overlooking a public plaza. Strong interest in the development could mean expanding it to as many as 70 townhouses, said Packers vice president and general counsel Ed Policy. \nThe Packers’ plan includes Lodge Kohler, a four-star hotel and spa, Hinterland Brewery and a Bellin Health sports medicine clinic west of Lambeau Field. Policy said there has also been a lot of interest in 180,000 square feet of commercial space on the north side of the district. \n“We have talked to a lot of prospective tenants. The reaction … has been tremendous,” Policy said. \nInitial investment in the project, including land acquisition and infrastructure improvements by the Packers, is estimated at $120 million to $130 million. \nPackers CEO Mark Murphy wants a specialty grocery store within walking distance of the townhouses, Press-Gazette Media (http://gbpg.net/1Ob0gr0 ) reported. Policy said it’s one of a number of concepts being discussed, and that it would not be a standard 70,000-square-foot grocery store. \nThe Packers filed project documents with the Village of Ashwaubenon this week. After the village approves its plans, which could be about 90 days, site preparation can begin. The three anchor developments and the public plaza could be ready by the beginning of the 2017 NFL season. \n___ \nInformation from: Press-Gazette Media, http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:48:11.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
