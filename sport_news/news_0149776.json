It played out well for us tonight. This is another huge win and a great performance, especially by our defense.”\nWasatch undoubtedly benefitted from the fact that Hall was forced out of the game with a left ankle injury in the second quarter and did not return.\nThat allowed the home team to turn up the pressure and give Maple Mountain very little to work with, forcing the Golden Eagles to punt seven times.\nWasatch, celebrating homecoming before a packed house at Wright-Tree Stadium, was dominant in all phases of the game except one — scoring touchdowns.\nNot until the final quarter with just over three minutes remaining did the Wasps finally reach pay dirt.\nTailback Kade Trowbridge scored on a 3-yard burst on first-and-goal following a mishandled snap by the Maple Mountain punter to ice the game for the home team.\nThat touchdown and the extra point kick gave Wasatch its 22 points, but the 15 scored before that all came off the foot of the Wasps All-American kicker Skyler Southam .\nSoutham connected on field goals from 44, 34, 53, 19 and 38 yards. His five makes tied a Utah state record for most field goals in a game and his third make on the night tied the record for most made in a single season. The kicker now has 19 so far.\n“Obviously we’re a little frustrated with our offense tonight,” said Coburn. “We had chances to get in the end zone, but we’ve built our offense for this. Skyler is a tremendous weapon and if we can get within his range, we’re taking the points.”\nThe Wasps moved the ball with ease in between the 20's, but failed to get the touchdowns to put the game away early.\nWasatch scored on its first possession with Southam’s 27-yard field goal and never looked back. Despite adding two more in the second quarter, the Wasp lead never felt comfortable.\nLeading 9-0 with 4:20 remaining in the third period, the Wasps seemed to have the play to break it open. Maple Mountain's backup quarterback was intercepted by defensive back Nick Piscitelli and returned for a 25-yard touchdown.\nA block-in-the-back penalty called the play back giving Wasatch first down at the visitors' 33-yard line. The Wasps failed to reach the end zone despite the turnover in good field position.\nA second Wasatch interception, this time by Carson Mahoney early in the fourth quarter, set the Wasps up with first-and-10 at the Maple Mountain 15. Wasatch could not find the end zone, however, and called on Southam for his fourth field goal.\nThe kicker added his record-tying fifth field goal just over three minutes later.\nAfter Wasatch finally managed to score that elusive touchdown making it 22-0 after the PAT, the Wasps began to celebrate knowing they had just taken hold of their third region victory.\nMaple Mountain backup quarterback Austin Edwards guided the visitors down the field for an 18-yard touchdown pass to receiver Dawson Beutler to avoid the shutout.\nThe win puts Wasatch, now 3-1, in sole possession of second place in Region 8 and in good position for the postseason. Maple Mountain fell to 2-2 and into a third-place tie with Salem Hills and Spanish Fork.\nKenny Bristow is the sports editor and staff sports writer for the Wasatch Wave and contributes to the Deseret News high school coverage for the Wasatch region.
