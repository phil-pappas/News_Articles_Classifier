Yes. Do I think he can beat us? Yes. If we let him come out and do what he does and play like hes been playing I mean its possible.”\nUtes safety Tevin Carter\nSALT LAKE CITY — California quarterback Jared Goff is earning a lot of praise and rightly so. The Heisman Trophy candidate and potential No. 1 overall pick in the NFL draft enters Saturday’s game at fifth-ranked Utah as the Pac-12 leader in touchdown throws (15) and passing yards (1,630). He also ranks among the national leaders in numerous categories including passer efficiency rating (170.5) and completion percentage (70.2).\nGoff’s play has the 23rd-ranked Bears one win away from their first 6-0 start since 1950.\nIt’s no wonder that Cal coach Sonny Dykes says he wouldn’t trade Goff for any other quarterback in college football.\nThe guy can play.\nUtah coach Kyle Whittingham acknowledges that Goff is a tremendous talent who very rarely misses a throw. Defending him won’t be easy.\n“It’s hard. He’s a savvy quarterback. He’s intelligent and very well-coached. Their offense is designed to get the ball out of his hands quickly. It’s hard to get to him because he does get the ball out of his hands so quickly,” Whittingham said. “You still have to try to go through your disguises and not give him a completely crystal-clear pre-snap read. He’s very good at deciphering coverages and blitzes and then uncovering where to go with the ball.”\nCal’s passing offense ranks second in the Pac-12 and ninth in the nation with 358.4 yards per game. Utah’s pass defense gives up an average of 238.5 yards, ranking eighth in the conference.\nSlowing Goff is an obvious priority.\n“Do I think he’s beatable? Yes. Do I think he can beat us? Yes. If we let him come out and do what he does and play like he’s been playing I mean it’s possible,” said starting safety Tevin Carter. “But we have a great defense and at the end of the day I feel we can beat anybody — but he’s a great quarterback.”\nGoff has thrown 68 touchdown passes in his career at Cal. It’s one of 23 school records he holds.\n“He’s a good quarterback. The only guy I can really compare him to is (USC’s Cody) Kessler. They’re pretty similar,” said Utah linebacker Jared Norris. “Goff puts the ball on the money 90 percent of the time it seems like and if the ball isn’t caught it’s like it should have been, you know.\n“He’s got a good release and so for a guy like that you’ve really got to be technical with your drops and how sound you play defensively,” Norris continued. “So I think this week we’ve just got to focus on execution defense-wise and making sure that we’re tight as a group.”\nCal is averaging 43.4 points per game and 527.8 yards of total offense through victories over Grambling State, San Diego State, Texas, Washington and Washington State. Junior wide receiver Kenny Lawler leads the Pac-12 with eight touchdown catches.\nOffense isn’t the only thing the Golden Bears are doing well. They’ve also excelled on defense — netting 18 takeaways, including 10 interceptions. Defensive end Kyle Kragen and safety Stefan McClure, both seniors, have been named the Pac-12’s top defenders the past two weeks.\nOverall, Cal has made a steady climb since going 1-11 in its first season under Dykes in 2013. The Bears went 5-7 last year and have already matched that win total this time around.\n“I like where we are right now as a program,” Dykes said. “We’ve stayed healthy. I like the fact that we have a little bit of momentum and we can continue that momentum into this game.”\nEXTRA POINTS: Cal leads the all-time series with Utah, 5-4. ... The Utes have won three of the last four meetings. The lone loss was a 34-10 decision in San Francisco in 2011 while Memorial Stadium in Berkeley was being renovated. ... The Golden Bears are just 1-2 in Salt Lake City, winning in 1963 but losing in 2003 and 2012.\nEmail: dirk@desnews.com\nTwitter: @DirkFacer", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:39:17.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
