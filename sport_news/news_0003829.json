We built the ball up, and someone got their head up, and Frankie Tagliaferri made a good run on a through ball,” Colts Neck girls soccer coach Doug Phillips said. “Wall did a good job of cutting off through balls today and making it difficult for us. They know how we play, and they were able to minimize our attack, which is a dangerous one.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:08:05.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
