Johnson Consulting, Inc.\nThey’ve arrived at Bob’s Big Boy in droves, leaving a trail of mud on the floor as they clattered about in soccer cleats and brightly-colored jerseys.\nSince the partial opening of Silverlakes Equestrian and Sports Complex on Sept. 5, massive groups have ventured into the burger joint on north Hamner Avenue in Norco, causing a major spike in weekend sales, General Manager Charley Trujillo said.\n“Everything’s been working well,” she said. “There’s been a big boost.”\nThe long-awaited project has been touted as a citywide revenue builder, but not all area businesses are benefiting.\nSarah Stark, office manager at Maverick Saloon less than a mile south of Silverlakes, said the increased traffic on the road hasn’t translated to new customers.\n“Everything’s the same,” Stark said. “More traffic is going by, but none of them are coming in. You’d think they would be, but, oh well.”\nCity officials are sending surveys this week to businesses managers as far south as Hidden Valley Parkway, in an attempt to gauge the immediate economic impact of the Silverlakes complex, City Manager Andy Okoro said.\nThe survey idea was born of an Economic Development Advisory Committee meeting, in which members speculated about the impacts to local restaurants, gas stations, and retail stores. Rather than wait for year-end tax information, the city pushed for a short-term barometer.\n“There’s been so much excitement, I think people just want to know what kind of impact (Silverlakes) is having here in town,” Okoro said.\nSeveral restaurants gave mixed reviews on the effect of Silverlakes. Survey results are expected in early November.\nA market analysis paid for by Norco and project developer Balboa Management Group in 2009, estimated Silverlakes could bring $37 million in city sales during its first year of operation. A little more than 78 percent of visitors’ daily per capita spending would go toward transportation expenses, food and beverages, and shopping, analysis data shows. The rest of the first-year spending, or roughly $8 million, was projected to come from overnight lodging.\nOkoro called the 6-year-old analysis outdated, and said the number of soccer events in the report are grossly understated. After the project’s first phase is complete, city officials will consider a new study “based on the real operations of Silverlakes,” he said.\nFinancial gains are one way to measure success, but Okoro said there are several intangible benefits to the project that won’t reveal themselves for months, perhaps years, after people familiarize themselves with the new complex.\nHe cited a recent drive down Interstate 15 in which he saw drivers ahead of him craning their necks to look at the brightly colored tents and dozens of fresh new sports fields at Silverlakes.\n“People are becoming aware of a city called Norco,” Okoro said. “I’ve been out on the fields and I’ve talked to parents. Prior to now, most of them didn’t know much about us.”\nTo date, a 2-mile horse trail and 24 multi-use sports fields are in use at Silverlakes. By the time the first horse show is held Dec. 13, Balboa COO Bicky Ross said five equestrian sand rings will be ready, along with a 7,000-square-foot concessions tent and bathroom areas.\nMore visitors could enhance Norco’s reputation as Horsetown USA, Okoro said, bringing in tourists and horse enthusiasts from across the southwest U.S.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9644, poneill@pe.com , @PE_PatrickO", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvk2s3-b88525902z.120151001121254000ghhc9bc8.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvk2s3-b88525902z.120151001121254000ghhc9bc8.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:05:21.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
