The late hit out of bounds has to be called and the refs should be fined. The NFL is all about safety and the dude launched helmet first with Brown 5 yards out of bounds. The slam after stopping forward progress mind you should have resulted in ejection. Dude took 4 steps and then picked him up and slammed him. How that wasn't called shows the refs should be atleast looked at. Made no sense. The first fumble the Rams had when 4 cardinals were around the ball. Arians should have challenged. They have a rule that if the video shows possession and the player on the ball it is given to them because of down by contact. That play obviously had a Ram diving into the pile and ripping the ball out. They showed a replay with the Cards around the ball...If it showed even for a second he landed on it and held it... it would have been worth a shot to challenge it. The Cards had everything go against them and yet barely lost. It happens. Arians did make some horrible decisions late in the game. And in key situations. Why are we not throwing to Larry more on 3rd down plays or inside the 10??? Dude wont drop the ball. Foles threw 3 of the best passes he has ever thrown in this game. Take 1 away and we probably win. Palmer threw 3 of the worst pass he has ever thrown. Make 1 of them and we probably win. Cards were not going to go 16-0 and I rather lose to the Rams who just seem to have our number than say to a really good team. Because then it comes across as we cant compete against the best. This game was a fluke and an upset. It happens. Buffalo looked awful too. With this lose, it seems we can compete against the worst.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T05:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:31:18.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
