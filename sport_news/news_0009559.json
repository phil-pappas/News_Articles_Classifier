I look forward to signing off my last season in domestic cricket at the conclusion of Indian Premier League 2016.\" \nZaheer, who made his India debut in 2000 and took 610 wickets across all three formats, had spells at Surrey and Worcestershire in 2004 and 2006 respectively. \nHe added: \"Cricket has been my only life over the past two decades and is, in fact, that the only thing I know well. Cricket has made me the individual I am, giving me everything in life and much more. I walk away with fantastic memories, life defining experiences and great friendships.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:07:51.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
