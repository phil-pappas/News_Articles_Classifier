The sophomore, who was just happy to break 20 minutes on the Darlington County Park course last year, (she finished with a personal best of 19:57.) had just run the same 5,000-meter course nearly two minutes faster than in 2014. \nHer time of 18:12 in winning the Division C race was faster than all but 12 runners in the 23-year history of the Bergen County course. It knocked her coach, Brianna Bayersdorfer out of the River Dell record books by completing a sweep of the course school records at Holmdel, Garret Mountain and Darlington. \nBut what made it even better was that it led the Golden Hawks girls and coach Bayersdorfer to their first county title since 1985 and their first back-to-back Bergen Meet of Champions appearances since 1992-93. \n“It’s an exciting thing to be able to feel as good as I do, run as well as I did and be part of such a great team,” said Goria, who ran the fastest girls time of the day and stamped herself as an individual contender at this Saturday’s Lou Molino Bergen Meet of Champions. \nRiver Dell, with five runners in the top 12, crushed NV/Demarest, 31-92, to take the C title, joining IHA in the Non-public Division A, Ridgewood, a comfortable winner in B, Ramsey in D and Hasbrouck Heights in E as girl team titlists. \nBoys winners in addition to Indian Hills in B, were: Don Bosco, sweeping Non-public Division A; River Dell, winning its first title since 2002 in C, Pascack Hills in D and Bogota winning its fourth straight title, this time in the new E division. \nIndian Hills senior Julia Guerra repeated in Division B, holding off Olympia Martin of Ridgewood by about 20 meters in the day’s closest and fastest overall race. Guerra ran 18:26, well off her seasonal best as the first five finishers broke 19 minutes on the crisp day. \n“I didn’t feel great today and Olympia ran very well,” said Guerra, who joined Glen Rock’s Alex Walter (D) as the day’s only girl repeat winners. “I know next week is going to be a tough and I’m sure I’ll be better then.” \nWalter outdueled Victoria Clinton of Ramsey in winning her second straight title, running 19:25 to win by 20 meters also. \n“It’s about 30 seconds slower than what I ran her last year,” Walter said. “But it’s the best race I’ve run all year and that gets me excited for the rest of the year.” \nIHA’s Giavanna Tabbachino, who has run in the shadows of the now-graduated Erin Ahearn and Colleen Buckley, stepped into the spotlight, winning her first division title in a personal-best 18:44 in the A race. \nThe boys races, outside of B, didn’t produce spectacular performances, but that was mainly because the top runners and teams were saving themselves for later races. \nDon Bosco, sitting out defending Bergen Meet of Champions titlist Patrick Sullivan with an Achilles’ issue, used the race as a tempo run with all seven runners finishing nearly simultaneous in 16:08 to win A. \nWill and Colin Daly also ran just hard enough to win, finishing together in 16:04 and helping River Dell’s 4-5-6 runners all break 17 minutes for the first time in a 28-46-50 win over Tenafly and NV/Demarest in C. \nBogota saw James Draney break Pat Rochford’s Darlington school record by winning E in 16:03, reversing recent losses to teammate Dan Daurio as Bogota coasted, 19-68, over Hasbrouck Heights. \nThe boys D race was perhaps the most competitive team and individual battle, with Sean Sullivan of Rutherford using his kick in the final 800 meters to pull away from Owen Davitt of Glen Rock by 50 meters in 16:10 and Pascack Hills placing its seven boys in a tight 40-second pack from 15th to 29th place to defeat Rutherford and Glen Rock, 97-102-102, for its first team title since 2008. It was the highest point total for a winning team since the meet split into divisions in 1973. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:21:42.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
