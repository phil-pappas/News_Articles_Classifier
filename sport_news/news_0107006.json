The accessory keeps the tarp lifted so that debris and moisture slide off the boat. This ensures that the boat remains clean and undamaged while not in use, which offers added peace of mind. It saves the owner from having to clean out the vessel interior prior to boating. Furthermore, the invention is designed to be lightweight, stable, user-friendly, reliable and practical.\nThe original design was submitted to the Atlanta office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
