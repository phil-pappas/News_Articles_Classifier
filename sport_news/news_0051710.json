There are a lot of cool, trendy things and the riverfront is really beautiful. You have a lot of great sports fans.\"\nMore importantly, the 20-year-old from Hermosa Beach, Calif., wants to atone for her sixth-place finish in a six-skater field at the Japan Open earlier this month.\n\"I just kind of choked, really,\" Gold said. \"I just got nervous and I didn't rely on all of my training and hard work. I just kind of froze. I wanted to skate so well and show everyone how hard I had been working and everything that I just ended up tripping over my own feet.\"\nSkate America will be held Friday through Sunday at the UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena. It's a first for Milwaukee, which has never hosted a major figure skating championship.\nShort programs for men, ladies, pairs and ice dance are scheduled for Friday, with the long programs scheduled for Saturday. The Smucker's Skating Spectacular, an exhibition, is set for 2 p.m. Sunday.\nSkate America features 56 world-class figure skaters, including Gold, the top U.S. finisher at the 2014 Olympics (fourth) and the silver medalist at the 2015 U.S. championships.\nGold won bronze at Skate America last year. Her goals for this season include qualifying for the six-skater Grand Prix final in December, winning the U.S. title in January and becoming the first U.S. woman since 2006 to finish on the podium at the World Championships.\nReigning U.S. pairs champions Alexa Scimeca and Chris Knierim also are in the field, as are 2014 Olympians Jason Brown and dance partners Madison Chock and Evan Bates.\nThe two skaters Gold finished behind at Skate America last year, Russians Elena Radionova and Elizaveta Tuktamysheva, are not entered this year. Her main competition could come from a third Russian, Julia Lipnitskaya, and Japan's Satoko Miyahara.\n\"I just try to keep my nose down and concentrate on my skating,\" said Gold, who is coached by Frank Carroll. \"I don't even know the full roster for Skate America. I just know that's where I'm going.\n\"Anytime you go to a great competition, there are going to be high-level skaters there. I just assume everyone is going to be amazing and skate perfectly and I just try to skate my best.\"\nTuktamysheva has performed the difficult triple Axel jump in competition. Gold made \"big strides\" while practicing the triple Axel until taking a hard fall on it a few weeks ago. She probably will not attempt it in Milwaukee.\n\"I actually really like it,\" she said. \"I can't wait to start working on it full time again. I don't feel like it has affected the rest of my skating in a negative way at all. I have, so far, a positive relationship with the triple Axel, so fingers crossed it just stays that way.\"\nScimeca and Knierim teamed up three years ago and also are in a committed relationship off the ice. They finished second at the U.S. championships in 2013 and fourth in 2014 before winning the title earlier this year.\n\"At first it's a dream of yours when you start skating to be in the Olympics and be on the podium at the Olympics,\" Knierim said. \"At this point it's become more I guess of a reality of something that can be achieved.\n\"We've gotten to the point where we are national champions and we have the skill set to be at the podium at worlds, to get to the Olympics, to fight for a spot on the podium at the Olympics. It's just kind of grown with our careers.\"\nFashion designer and former \"Project Runway\" contestant Timothy Westbrook, who lived in Milwaukee until recently, designed an exhibition costume for Scimeca. She will debut the costume during the Skating Spectacular when she and Knierim skate to a live performance of \"The Flower Duet\" from the opera \"Lakme\" by Milwaukee's Florentine Opera.\n ", "external_links": ["http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/JSI/RWS/jsonline.com/CAI/336129561/E/prod/PC/Basic/AT/A"], "published": "2015-10-23T11:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:54:05.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
