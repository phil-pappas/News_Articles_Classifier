Michigan punter Blake O’Neill faced the media to explain the final fateful seconds as he dropped the snap, then got flung around and watched the ball bounce straight to Michigan State for the game-winning touchdown return.\n“I tried to sort of kick it over my head, and that didn’t work out,” the Australian graduate student said, according to ESPN. \n“That’s life. That’s football. You learn from it so you can do better and pick yourself up, dust yourself and move on. We’re sort of taught to pick up and move it on. Obviously, that’s completely on me. I own this error and very much know better if I was to have my time over again.”\nThe Colts line up for their ill-fated fake punt. Photo: NBC While the Michigan mistake was one of game-deciding agony, the Colts’ ridiculous punt formation swung momentum and made the team a league-wide laughingstock. Colts punter Pat McAfee described what the team had in mind when they had nine players lined up away from where Griff Whalen hiked the ball to Colt Anderson and was tackled easily for a turnover on downs.\n“The point of the play is a deception play,” McAfee told an Indianapolis radio station .\n“So you’re trying to manipulate the [Patriots] into thinking they have to sub their defense back on. We are sprinting to the sideline in hopes to make the other team think we are subbing our offense back on the field.”\nMcAfee said there was such confusion because Clayton Geathers was supposed to be the center on the play, but had suffered a knee injury. Whalen did not know he was not supposed to snap the ball unless the Patriots had run off the field.\nThe awful play has turned the heat up on Colts coach Chuck Pagano , while the Wolverines’ O’Neill has received threats on social media. But the punter has stayed away from that criticism.\n“I just figured I think I’d be better off to let this one cool down a little bit before I check it,” he said. “I’ve certainly been impressed by the amount of people who have taken time out of their day to say thank you for playing for Michigan and supporting me. I’m really appreciative of all that.”\n  chuck pagano ,  college football ,  indianapolis colts ,  michigan wolverines ,  nfl", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T13:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:59:48.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
