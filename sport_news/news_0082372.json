It had been arranged when Mr McCullum was in a bar with Mr Ponting, and Mr McCullum got a taxi to the hotel. \nWhen Cairns said he had a \"business proposition\" for him, Mr McCullum said that as he was young he was unsure what it meant, but that he was \"excited about it and I thought I would wait and see what happened\". \nOver a bottle of red wine and a curry ordered on room service Cairns asked Mr McCullum if he knew \"anything about spot fixing in cricket,\" Mr McCullum claimed. \nIt was explained to him that you manipulated the runs in a match, but not the result of the game, Mr McCullum claimed. \nHe said that Cairns went through different periods of the game, breaking it down, and noted that an impact could be made. \nHe claimed that a player would \"underperform\" and that Cairns drew up a \"quite thorough\" description of it on paper involving splits and overs which make up the game. \nAsked by prosecutor Sasha Wass QC if this was a \"legitimate\" way to play cricket, Mr McCullum replied: \"No, it was not an honest game of cricket.\" \nOn his reaction to the proposition, Mr McCullum told the court: \"I was shocked. I sort of thought he may have been joking but I quickly became aware that he was not joking. He said that everybody is doing it, all the big boys are doing it. Will you take it on?\" \nMr McCullum told the court that the names of players Daniel Vettori and Jacob Oram were mentioned, but Cairns then said \"they did not have the balls to do it\" . \nHe also said that \"Asian names\" were mentioned and that Cairns had said that \"between 70,000 to 200,000 US\" dollars per spot fix could be made. \nMr McCullum told the jury: \"I wish I had said no straight away. I could not comprehend that Chris would put me in a position which would risk my future in the game.\" \nIn 2010 Cairns was accused by the chairman of the Indian Premier League, Lalit Modi, on Twitter of match-fixing at the Chandigarh Lions in the Indian Cricket League two years earlier. \nHe brought a libel action against Mr Modi, winning Â£90,000 in damages. \nCairns, 45, from Auckland, is charged with perjury and perverting the course of justice, while Andrew Fitch-Holland, from Burton Road, Manchester, is accused of perverting the course of justice. \nThey both deny the charges. \nMr McCullum described himself as \"slightly apprehensive\" about the whole situation and asked Cairns how you get the money back in to New Zealand from doing such a deal. \nHe claims he was told that you do not take the money back to New Zealand straight away. The trick was to buy property in New Zealand and to leave it there for \"a couple of years\" before cashing it in, he told the court. \nThe penalty for failing to promptly tell cricket's authorities about an approach for match fixing is that a player could be stood down from international cricket for one to five years, the jury was told. \nMr McCullum claims that Cairns approached him three times in an effort to get him to match fix. \nAsked why he did not report the first alleged approach, Mr McCullum said: \"I kind of did not want it to be true. He was someone I looked at as a friend.\" \nHe claimed that Cairns made a second approach to him about it in a \"pretty brief\" telephone call. \nHe said Cairns congratulated him on one of his matches and then asked \"if I had changed my mind - I said no\". \nAs the chat ended Cairns said \"remember this conversation never happened\", Mr McCullum claimed. \nThe third approach was allegedly made as the men had breakfast in June 2008, when Mr McCullum was playing in Worcester. \nMr McCullum told the court that Cairns was \"not aggressive and I felt I could say no\", adding that \"Chris was a hero, I did not feel threatened by his approaches\". \nHe claimed that Cairns asked him again, at breakfast, if he had changed his mind and he said no. \nMr McCullum eventually reported the allegations to cricket's anti-corruption authorities in February 2011. \nHe had decided to speak up after the New Zealand team had been given a talk by the Anti-Corruption and Security Unit during the World Cup. \nOrlando Pownall QC, defending Cairns, pointed out that Mr McCullum's success and skill on the field had helped himself and others amass a large fortune. \nMr Pownall described \"brand McCullum\" as \"prestigious\" and as covering a range of industries, both inside and outside of cricket. \nIt is something that Mr McCullum would want to ensure \"remains intact\", Mr Pownall suggested. \nHe questioned Mr McCullum about the three statements he had made - from 2011 to 2014 - on the allegations. \nHe suggested that Mr McCullum had not told \"the unvarnished truth\". \nMr McCullum claimed his answers were truthful and any differences or greater details were perhaps because the questions had changed slightly over time. \nMr McCullum told the court: \"I was scared to come forward and say that someone I admired in New Zealand had asked me to come forward to match fix.\" \nOn why he had not spoken up around the time of the controversy between Cairns and Mr Modi, Mr McCullum said he did not feel \"it was my responsibility to get between\" them. \nHe also said he had not faced a tribunal about his late reporting of the allegations. \n\"I have been told that the ICC and the Anti-Corruption Unit are comfortable about how things have turned out,\" he told the court. \nMr McCullum accepted that his witness statements had \"developed\" over time but said that he was telling the truth. \nNew Zealand test player Daryl Tuffey was among the names thrown up in the match-fixing controversy as working for Cairns, the court has heard. \nUnder cross-examination Mr Pownall told Mr McCullum: \"The simple point is that you had somebody who, according to you, you allege to be a cheat and you did nothing. Mr Vettori did nothing. It was not a one-off. It was over a number of years. Is that fair?\" \nMr McCullum replied: \" Yes that's fair.\" \nMr McCullum later said that it was not easy to report Cairns, saying: \"I did not want to at all.\" \nHe also said that he \"probably deliberately did not tell\" Mr Ponting, a known hard liner against corruption, about the allegations. \nMs Wass later asked him if it had helped him professionally in his business interests as \"Brand McCullum\" to give evidence against Cairns in court. \nHe replied: \"Not to my knowledge, no.\" \nEarlier, coach and former cricketer Shane Bond, speaking via videolink, recalled playing for the Delhi Giants in the Indian Cricket league, when Cairns was captain of the Chandigarh Lions. \nMr Bond told the court that he remembered watching a game on TV where the lions won in October 2008 and Cairns did not seem pleased. \nIn part of a witness statement read to the court, Mr Bond described Cairns as \"applauding, doing it very slowly and not looking very happy. To me he did not seem pleased that Chandigarh had won\". \nAfter footage of the end of the match was played in court, Mr Bond said: \"There was certainly shots of Chris looking glum.\" \nMr Bond, a former police officer, added: \"No, I do not think I got it wrong. If you play it further back I think you will see that Chris was not happy with what had gone on.\" \nThe hearing was adjourned to tomorrow at 9.30am.
