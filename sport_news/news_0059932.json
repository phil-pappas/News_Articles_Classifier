He became the night’s featured ball carrier in the Seaters’ tricky veer, running 17 times for 73 very tough yards against the blood and guts of the middle of the Panthers’ defense. When the Seaters need clutch carries, they turned to DeLuca. \nOn defense, DeLuca became the featured tackler on an aggressive Belvidere side. His ability to penetrate into the Roselle Park backfield disrupted the Panthers’ timing and execution and led to four tackles for loss including 1.5 sacks. \nDeLuca was all smiles afterward. \n“That’s most definitely my best game ever on offense,” he said with a ear-to-ear smile. “It was just Belvidere football, ground and pound. I’m the fullback, I run up the middle, and I’m fine with that. I think I had a breakout game tonight.” \nYou could say that again. \n“When Zack gets going running, he’s a beast,” Belvidere coach Josh Costantino said. \nDeLuca’s relentless pounding in the middle forced Roselle Park to tighten its defense up, leaving its flanks exposed, and when Panthers defenders bit on the often-baffling fakes of quarterback Jake Thornton to DeLuca, the outside opened up for Thornton and the halfbacks. \nWhen it wasn’t a fake, DeLuca took the ball and ran hard, pushing the pile and gaining yards and yards after initial contact. \n“Zach was awesome,” Thornton said. “He was getting 5 yards a carry, that’s what we do on offense and he did it to perfection. He came up with an answer every time.” \nDeLuca made his yards behind an offensive line that owned the line of scrimmage. Belvidere launched scoring drives of 67, 63, 73, and 80 yards behind a front five of Baylor and sophomore Jonathan Wolfinger at tackles, seniors Josh Pershpalaj and Jim McKenna at guards and sophomore Ryan Kokawski at center. \n“They were big tonight,” DeLuca said. “I wouldn’t have gotten half the yards I did without them.” \nOn defense, DeLuca said he was able to read Roselle Park’s guards and use that key to know which gap to attack. Belvidere’s defensive line of Pershpalaj and senior Russell Lebo at ends, junior Jake Gold and McKenna at tackles and impressive sophomore Nick Spadaccini at nose tackle absorbed whatever push the Panthers came up with and allowed Baylor and DeLuca, along with sophomore linebacker David Kinney , to find the ball carrier and drop him. \n“I like hitting people,” DeLuca said. “It was a team effort on defense. The line did a great job.” \nBut only Zack DeLuca painted a masterpiece. \nBrad Wilson may be reached at bwilson@lehighvalleylive.com . Follow him on Twitter @bradwsports .
