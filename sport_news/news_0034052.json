Or did it?\nActually, with 2:53 left a portion of the glass and boards in the Panthersâ€™ zone were dislodged after a body check. Instead of waiting for the maintenance crew to repair the glass, the on-ice officials send the players to their respective locker rooms.\nAccording to Rule 17:07 in the NHL rule book, if any unusual delay occurs within five minutes of the end of the first or second periods, the referee may order the next regular intermission to be taken immediately. The balance of the period will be completed on the resumption of play with the teams defending the same goals after which the teams will change ends and resume play of the ensuing period without delay.\"\nAfter the intermission the remaining 2:53 of the first period was played, but not before Jaromir Jagr scored his second goal of the continued first period just 27 seconds in for a 2-0 lead after one.\nOnce the 2:53 expired, the players switched sides. Jagr had a power-play goal at 8:52 of the first which tied him for 13 th place all-time with Joe Sakic in PPGs. His second goal gives him 726 career goals, five behind Marcel Dionne for fourth place all time.\n Ice Hockey Florida Panthers Jaromir Jagr Buffalo Sabres NHL", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56204ba4/turbine/sfl-panthers-glass-early-intermission-sabres-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-16T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:55:23.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
