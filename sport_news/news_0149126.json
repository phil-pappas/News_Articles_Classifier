The Royals’ Kendrys Morales and Prince Fielder of the Rangers also are finalists. The winner will be announced Nov. 9.\n“I think it’s good that people recognized what [Rodriguez has] done on the field and not let what’s happened in the past cloud their judgment,” Yankees manager Joe Girardi said before the Yankees’ 4-1 playoff-clinching win over the Red Sox at the Stadium. “It’s for whatever reason: You don’t have a good year, you don’t play. It comes up for a lot of different reasons. But he has been extremely important to our club and extremely important to our clubhouse.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under alex rodriguez ,  new york yankees", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:35:07.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
