(Image Source: Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images) \nThe New York Mets are built around their power pitching starting rotation of young guns. They had three quality starts in five against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLDS, but even when they were not quality, the Mets starters pitched at least five innings in every game and never allowed more than three runs. \nNY Mets NLCS Preview: The Lineup & Bench \nThe Rotation: This is where the Mets have the biggest edge. New York will send Dark Knight Matt Harvey to the hill in Game 1 against the Cubs. In his only NLDS start, Harvey struck out seven in five innings for the win, but he allowed two earned runs and wasn’t his sharpest. Harvey had been going on extra rest and the hope is now that he’s on a regular schedule he will rediscover his command. When he puts the baseball where he wants to Harvey is close to unhittable. \nRookie Noah Syndergaard pitched an inning of relief on Thursday night but you would expect him to be ready for Game 2 on Sunday. New York’s staff is laden with fire ballers and no one throws harder than Thor, who can hit 100 miles power hour when he rears back. He allowed just one run over the first six innings in LA in Game 2, but was burned when Chase Utley was granted second base after the umpire’s controversial call, as Syndergaard allowed three runs in 6.1. He’s been a much better pitcher at home so he will probably look forward to starting in Citi Field. \nThe ace of the postseason thus far has been All-Star Jacob deGrom , who shutout the Dodgers in Game 1 for seven innings and grinded out a series-deciding win in Game 5, allowing no runs in his final five innings after being touched up for two runs in the first. Like Harvey and Syndergaard, deGrom throws in the high nineties, which he complements with a change up and breaking pitches. \nLefty Steven Matz is a likely candidate to start Game 4. The rookie had a rough postseason debut, allowing three runs over five innings against the Dodgers, however he was put in a tough spot. Matz, who only had six career starts coming into postseason play, hadn’t pitched for 20 days before taking the ball in the NLDS. He can bring it in the mid-to-high nineties as well, but unlike New York’s other young guns, Matz is more likely to lose his control at times. \nThe Pen: The Mets are all set at closer, where Jeurys Familia was perfect in the NLDS. The first-year stopper faced 16 Dodgers over 5.1 innings and retired them all, including a six-out save in the decisive game. Familia combines command and velocity, hitting in the high nineties with his fastball, and the mid-nineties with his slider and splitter. \nThe biggest question mark in New York’s pitching staff is the bridge between the starters and their closer. That’s why Syndergaard pitched the seventh and Familia was asked to go two innings in Game 5. \nThe Mets did not have a clear-cut seventh inning guy throughout the season. If you had to pinpoint one reliever it probably would have been Hansel Robles . The 25-year old power pitcher had a WHIP of 1.02 with 61 Ks in 54 innings, however he walked 18 and served up eight homers. He pithed one scoreless inning against LA, which is better than either Addison Reed (6.75 ERA in NLDS) or Tyler Clippard (5.40 ERA in NLDS) did in the NLDS. \nDown the stretch of the season, the former closer (with the Chicago White Sox & Arizona Diamondbacks) Reed appeared to take over the seventh-inning role, however it may be wide-open heading into the NLCS. Clippard stepped seamlessly into the set-up role when he came over in a July trade and he was lights out in August (0.60 ERA) but very hittable in September (6.59 ERA). \nAgainst the Dodgers, Collins showed more faith in starter turned postseason reliever Bartolo Colon (3 appearances, 4 innings, 4.50 ERA; Note: 1 of the 2 runs he allowed was Chase Utley scoring after he was placed back on second base). Colon could provide long relief and be a short guy, capable of inducing a ground ball with runners on base. A sixth starter, longtime Met Jonathon Niese , is New York’s primary lefty out of the pen. He struck out the only Dodger he faced in the NLDS and I wouldn’t be surprised if he sees more action against the Cubbies. Erik Goeddel faced four batters in Game 3 and allowed four straight hits, his only appearance against the Dodgers. \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
