I threw two picks, fumbled one. You can't win when you play like that.\" \nAfter the game, Tomlin said that Roethlisberger was close to being ready to go, and that his knee injury should be healed enough in time for next week's game against Cincinnati. \n\"We decided to go with the guy that had the practice reps. That was the appropriate thing to do. No second-guessing,\" Tomlin said. \"We'll move forward with Ben as we prepare this week.\" \nLeVeon Bell ran for 121 yards for the Steelers (4-3), who had won three straight against Kansas City. Antonio Brown had six catches for 124 yards, and Martavis Bryant caught his 11th touchdown pass in 12 career games. \nIt still wasn't enough to overcome the turnovers and miscues. \n\"They made more dynamic plays,\" Tomlin said, \"particularly over the last 30 minutes of the game. They converted necessary third downs on offense and made dynamic, game-changing plays.\" \nAlex Smith threw for 251 yards and a touchdown, and Charcandrick West ran for 110 yards and his first career score, helping the Chiefs (2-5) end a five-game losing streak. \n\"This is something we've been working toward,\" said Eric Berry, whose first interception since being diagnosed with cancer in December led to the Chiefs' first touchdown. \nThe first half amounted to a field-goal fest, which wasn't all that surprising considering the amount of offensive talent that both teams were missing to injury. \nSantos hit three of them after Chiefs drives stalled in the red zone, though he did miss a 54-yarder just before the half. Chris Boswell knocked through a 24-yarder for Pittsburgh. \nThe Chiefs finally established a cushion midway through the third quarter. \nIt began when Jones threw a pass over the middle that skipped away from Brown and right to Berry, who reacted quickly enough to make the diving interception. \nThe Chiefs capitalized by driving 47 yards, at one point using a hurry-up offense to keep Pittsburgh off-balance. West finally plunged in from a yard on third-and-goal to end a streak of seven trips to the red zone without a touchdown, and giving Kansas City a 16-3 lead. \n\"Unreal,\" West said. \"I feel like I'm still in the end zone.\" \nPittsburgh quickly answered behind Jones, whose 41-yard completion to Brown helped set up its lone touchdown. Jones lofted a pass that Bryant hauled in while tip-toing in the corner of the end zone — replays confirmed he made the reception after initially bobbling it. \nThe Chiefs were forced to punt, the Steelers added another field goal, and suddenly it looked as if another fourth-quarter lead would evaporate at Arrowhead Stadium. \nThis time, the struggling Kansas City offense — missing wide receiver Jeremy Maclin to injury and with a revamped offensive line — made every play that mattered. \nSmith hit tight end Travis Kelce for a 26-yard reception to convert a third down, and West ripped off a 36-yard run moments later. He added a short run on an option play to convert another third down, and Smith hit Conley from 5 yards with 5:13 left to put the game away. \n\"We didn't let off the accelerator for four quarters,\" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \"I thought that was important.\" \nNotes: Steelers CBs William Gay (shoulder) and Antwon Blake (concussion) left the game. Their status for next week was unknown. ... The Chiefs last beat Pittsburgh on Nov. 27, 2011. ... The Steelers had been plus-6 in turnover differential, tied for the league lead. They were minus-3 on Sunday. ... Pittsburgh TE Heath Miller did not catch a pass, ending a streak of 110 games. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T23:32:46.429+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
