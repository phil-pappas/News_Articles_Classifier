(MCT) Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 11:34 AM Updated at 11:47 AM CARRBORO – Carrboro High School has cancelled its home football with Barlett Yancey on Friday night due to too many of its players being injured, the school said in a statement released Wednesday night. The Jaguars have suffered “an increased number of injuries over the past two weeks,” the statement said. “The decision was based on the safety and the well being of our athletes. We will not make up the game at this time.” Carrboro’s next game is Oct. 23 against Graham. It will be played if Carrboro has enough healthy players. By Steve Wiseman / The Herald-Sun, Durham, N.C.
