He's the player I played the most against in my life. There are no secrets.\"\nTen-time major-winner Djokovic had been irresistible in his run to the semi-finals, dropping only nine games thus far and he soon had Ferrer gasping with two breaks of serve to go 4-1 ahead in the first set.\nFerrer, who won his 25th career title last week in Kuala Lumpur, conjured a break of his own but the stung Djokovic broke straight back and finished the set impressively in the next game.\nTwo more breaks in the second set put Djokovic on his way and despite a mini-implosion, when he double-faulted twice and was broken as he served for the match, a sixth break of the Ferrer serve earned him victory.\nNadal's path to the final was much less smooth but he grittily outpunched Fognini, who has beaten him three times this season and with whom he had a furious on-court row in the Hamburg final in August.\nNadal denied an extra edge to the match in Beijing, but his lukewarm handshake at the net and apparent exchanges between his coach and uncle, Toni Nadal, and Fognini told a different story.\nFog of war\nNadal won the bad-tempered Hamburg final but Fognini stunned the Spaniard in last month's US Open third round, becoming only the fourth player to beat him three times in the same season.\n\"No rivalry at all. No, no, no. I don't know what's going on, seriously,\" Nadal insisted. \"We had the issue that we had in Hamburg, and that's it. No problems.\"\nFognini also said the Hamburg row was in the past but he indicated ill-feeling may remain against Nadal's team and in particular his coach and uncle, Toni, who was seen angrily gesticulating courtside.\n\"What happened in Hamburg is past, for sure. But I have nothing to say (to Nadal). I have all respect with him outside and inside the court,\" said the Italian.\n\"I was telling another time, the history (argument) was not against him, but against his team, especially the uncle. But is something that is really far away.\n\"If I have to do something, I do it in the moment. If I do it wrong, I say, 'Sorry'. If I'm right, I'm right, and that's it.\"\nFor .", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:54:55.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
