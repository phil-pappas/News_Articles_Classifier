Matt Murschel Contact Reporter Orlando Sentinel UF quarterback Will Grier has begun the process of appealing his NCAA-mandated suspension \nWill Grier is embarking on an NCAA appeal process that will determine when he will be able to play for the Gators again. \nAs a result of testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug, the redshirt freshman quarterback is facing an NCAA-mandated year-long suspension that is slated to bench him for the first six games of next season. An emotional Grier admitted Monday to taking an over-the-counter supplement that trigged the positive test Monday, but the next step in this saga is already in play. \nUF coach Jim McElwain said Monday the school would help Grier appeal the suspension, and the athletics department confirmed Wednesday the appeal is under way. \nNCAA rules require athletes to notify officials they plan to file an appeal within two business days of the positive test result, which McElwain said he first heard about Sunday. \nThe NCAA performs year-round drug testing and the frequency of the tests is unpredictable. In some cases, a program can be tested only once and other times it can be done three times. Each test is done with little-to-no advance notice.

A detailed summary of the athlete's appeal and the school's drug prevention education program is due five days before the conference call. \nMembers of the Drug-Education and Drug-Testing subcommittee of the NCAA Committee on Competitive Safeguards and Medical Aspects of Sports hear the appeal and determine the result. The group consists of nine members and includes athletics directors, faculty athletic representatives, team physicians and athletic trainers. If a member of subcommittee is employed by the institution involved in the appeal, that person will not be present to hear the appeal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:50:45.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
