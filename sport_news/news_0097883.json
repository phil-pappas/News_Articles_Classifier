But when a team’s season feels like a roller coaster ride, it can be nauseating. The Greeley West boys soccer team is one squad that might have felt a little nauseous from its jaunt this fall. The Spartans ascended to the top of the track early in the season, but almost just as quickly, they found themselves heading toward a big dropoff. Now, West is trying to climb back up the standings with the end of the regular season looming. The Spartans started the climb Thursday with an 8-0 win against Mountain View in a Class 4A Northern Conference game. With two games left, West (2-3-1 Northern, 8-3-2 overall) is sitting in seventh place in the conference. Coach Marty Lordemann said the top 4 teams will automatically make the state playoffs, so the Spartans want to win their final two games to assure they get in. If West does that, it will finish conference play in third place. If they go 1-1, the Spartans should still get in. “We’re on a great path,” Lordemann said Thursday. “This is the perfect time to get better, to start peaking. And with two more games left, I’m confident we can win them both.” In the game against Mountain View, Lordemann said he changed the formation to fit in two players who had been ineligible up to that point. “And I loved it,” he said. “We played so well out of that formation that I’m excited for the next two games, and the boys are excited.” West will go on the road at 4 p.m. Tuesday at fifth-place Silver Creek (3-3, 6-7). For its last game, West will host league-leading Longmont (5-0-1, 11-1-1) at 6:30 p.m. Thursday. The Spartans have already had a strong season. They have allowed only 11 goals to opposing teams, and goalkeeper Juan Pena has recorded five shutouts. West has won four of its games by one goal, including two overtime wins, and the Spartans tied Windsor, 0-0, and Greeley Central, 1-1. West sophomore Kelton Boyd said the reason for the Spartans’ success has been teamwork. “We believe in each other. That’s pretty much it,” he said. “If you believe in each other, then you can do it. … Everybody loves each other and (when we’re) all playing soccer together, we work really good.” But the Spartans’ three losses happened within two weeks after they started the season 7-0-1. Boyd said during the losing streak, it was tough for the players to have confidence in one another. “And we started getting mad at each other and we gave up on each other,” he said. After a 4-1 loss to Niwot, which is second in the conference, Lordemann said the Spartans talked about not getting down on themselves. “Winning’s contagious, and if they get down on themselves, they’re just going to keep losing,” Lordemann said. “And they did some soul searching over the last couple days, and I asked them, ‘What can you guys do different to be a better player on the field, on the team?’ “And I think they all did it. So, we’ll see what happens. Two more to go.” Getting an 8-0 win Thursday should help the Spartans get back on the right path. Spartans senior Luke Lordemann said the team collaboration and chemistry were apparent in the win against Mountain View. “(We had) lots of passing,” he said. “Our movement off the ball was really good, too.” West senior Zac Bitton, who’s a four-year varsity player, said communication on the field is important to the Spartans’ success, as well. “Last year, we didn’t click quite as well as we have this year, and it’s been really good,” he said. “ … Our game plan really hasn’t changed. No matter what game (it is), we want to win and we just have to play hard.” Bitton said he and four other seniors have been playing together on varsity since freshman year. “We’ve really come together as a team and I think we have good leadership,” Bitton said. “It just boosts your motivation to work harder when they push you,” Boyd said of the seniors’ leadership. Luke Lordemann said the Spartans are focusing on getting a good seed for the playoffs. “It’d be really cool if we went to state,” he said. “We’ve got a lot of seniors on the team that have wanted to do it for four years, so it’d be nice.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:08:38.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
