They maneuvered their opponents all over the court.” \nA critical point came in the third set. Hoy and Stewart, the third seeds, had been winning the set 4-1 before losing the next two games. The next point went to deuce a few times before the BHS duo prevailed. Pal-Mac won one more game before Hoy and Stewart sealed the deal. \n“It was an excellent job by those two kids,” Walkowski said. \nLea Morgan and Ariana Ross also made it to state qualifiers in the playbacks by beating the second-seeded duo of Ashley Porter and Kathryn Pieters of Newark 4-6, 6-4, 6-2. \nIn singles, Batavia’s Melissa Mountain lost to Pal-Mac’s Cara Graham 6-1, 6-4 in playbacks. \n“Melissa played an excellent, excellent (match) against her,” Walkowski said. “It was just a little bit too much to overcome.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T08:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:13:53.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
