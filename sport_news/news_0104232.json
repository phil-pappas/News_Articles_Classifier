Pilcher , The Gazette October 15, 2015 | 5:23 pm \nMANCHESTER — Coy Roussell has been a fixture of West Delaware’s backfield ever since his sophomore season. \nThe efforts have earned him just about every major career rushing record in the Hawks program. All that came despite missing one-third of last season, sitting out the final three weeks and the postseason’s first round due to injury and a bout with mononucleosis. \n“It’s just one of those things you have to get through,” Roussell said. “It makes you that much stronger and better.” \nThe senior running back is on pace for his best individual season yet. He will attempt to add to his totals when the second-ranked Hawks host rival No. 6 Independence Friday night in a battle of Class 3A District 3 leaders. West Delaware (7-0, 4-0) is looking for a second straight district crown, while the Mustangs (7-0, 5-0) are enjoying their best season since going 7-2 in 1975. \nLast season, Roussell supported his team from the sidelines. It wasn’t a role he relished, having to watch as the Mustangs handed West Delaware a 10-0 loss. He developed a greater appreciation for the chance to take the field. \n“I tell everyone it goes by quick,” Roussell said about his prep career. “Last year, I tell them how it sucked not being able to play a few games. It was very hard.” \nNone were harder than the loss to Independence, which was the second game he missed. It was the worst offensive production of the season. The Mustangs held them to 289 yards of total offense. \n“It was a tough game to lose,” Roussell said. “We’re always a big rival with Independence. They are a good football team now. They have some athletes. \n“It’s always a game you want to go out and win. It’s just a hard-fought game.” \nThe 5-fooot-11, 191-pounder devoted his time to the weight room, lifting and exercising to increase his flexibility and durability. He said he has gained speed and quickness. West Delaware Coach Doug Winkowitsch praised Roussell’s work. \n“He had a tremendous off-season,” Winkowitsch said. “He’s so strong he had to work on his flexibility just because he has gotten so strong. It’s a matter of something he has to do to make sure he stayed healthy and didn’t pull any muscles.” \nRoussell has been impressive, rushing for 1,450 yards with 19 touchdowns so far this season. Both are already the seventh-best single-season totals in West Delaware history. \nThe totals raise his career numbers to 4,400 rushing yards and 56 TDs. He also has 118 points for 344 in his career. All three are career records for the Hawks, surpassing the old marks (2,977, 41 and 280) set by Brandon Domeyer from 2009-10. \n“Coy is that back that has tremendous balance,” Winkowitsch said. “He is also extremely explosive so it’s nice that when he has the ball in his hands he has the opportunity to score.” \nRoussell has averaged 207 rushing yards per game. He started the season with his sights set on the 2,000-yard level. He would have to maintain that average through the first round of the playoffs to reach it, but he isn’t taking anything for granted. \n“I just wanted to take it one game at a time,” Roussell said. “I’ve been pleased with how everything has gone. I just keep trying to reach that goal each game.” \nWest Delaware has thrived with a balanced offense. The ground game has complemented a passing attack led by Max Ridenour, who moved back under center from receiver to replace all-stater Brent Lammers, who graduated. Ridenour has thrown for 1,390 yards and 17 TDs. Defenses are unable to focus on just one element of the Hawks offense. \n“We’re probably about as balanced as we’ve ever been,” Winkowitsch said. “Coy has helped our passing game and our passing game has helped Coy.” \nThe pair have been playing together since middle school. They have a strong rapport. Roussell is glad to have him back in the backfield. \n“I think it’s turned out really well,” Roussell said. “We’re really good friends. We connect well together. \n“He’s done a really good job.” \nThey will need to be at their best against the Mustangs, who have rolled this season. Independence ascended the rankings with big wins over programs like Decorah, Waverly-Shell Rock and defending 2A champion North Fayette Valley. Independence’s Nicholas Holt is third in all classes with 2,291 total passing and rushing yards. He has rushed for 1,203 yards and 19 TDs. \nThe Hawks will approach the game like any other contest. \n“Our intent is to beat every team,” Winkowitsch said. “We’re going to try to play this the same as we played the rest. \n“We have to play a good football game, because we’re going to see a very talented team come to our place and this should be a terrific game.” \nl Comments: (319) 368-8679; kj.pilcher@thegazette.com Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:07:47.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
