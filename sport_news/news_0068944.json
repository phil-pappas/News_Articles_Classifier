The Wildcats lost 55-0. ken.corbitt@cjonline.com \nMANHATTAN — Stunned, shocked, frustrated, angry, confused. \nThe emotions ran the gamut throughout the Kansas State locker room Saturday after at 55-0 loss to No. 19 Oklahoma, a setback that brought about a search of the record book for several listings of worst loss or first shutout since … \nAll that needed to be noted was it was the worst loss by point margin ever for a Bill Snyder-coached Wildcat team. \n“It was a pretty soft locker room,” senior offensive tackle Cody Whitehair said. “Guys were quiet, but I did see some determined faces, which is good. Our leaders stepped up and said something and hopefully our team will take that and get things going again.” \nThe Wildcats (3-3, 0-3 Big 12) lost their third straight game, but this one was quite different than the previous two. After building double-digit leads against Oklahoma State and TCU only to falter in the closing minutes, the Cats were never in this game. The Sooners need only five plays and 64 seconds to cover 75 yards for a touchdown after the opening kickoff and built a 35-0 halftime lead. \n“It was out of hand so quick,” defensive tackle Will Geary said. “The offense couldn’t put any points up and we couldn’t stop them. Oklahoma just came out and gave it to us. \n“I did not expect that at all. Oklahoma just came out on fire and we couldn’t match it and it got out of hand.” \nIt was a collective failure in all areas as K-State’s offense managed only 110 total yards and seven first downs while the defense gave up 568 yards, with OU quarterback Baker Mayfield passing for 336 yards and five first-half touchdowns. \n“We had too many mistakes,” Whitehair said. “We had interceptions, we had missed blocks, missed tackles … anything and everything went not our way. I think we fought to the end and I was proud of the guys for that.” \nIn a rare occurrence, a majority of Wildcat fans didn’t return to their seats for the second half and a sellout crowd of 52,867 was nearly all gone by the end. \n“It was kind of sad to see our fans leave, and we feel like that’s on our shoulders,” Whitehair said. “Since I’ve been here I’ve never seen that happen, and that’s all on us. \n“It hurts our fans, it hurts us, it hurts the K-State family. We’re going to bounce back and show them what we’re really made of and let them know this is a good football team.” \nThe Wildcats said they won’t give up and hope the fans won’t give up on them. \n“I’d say watch how we respond,” Geary said. “That will be the true tale of the tape, how we come back and finish this season out. \n“I believe in this team. We have the chemistry and we hold each other accountable to not let this happen again.” \nThe 0-3 conference start, with a trip to Texas this week, has K-State’s season at a critical point. \n“We’re a 3-3 football team now so that game will be a statement game for us,” Whitehair said. “We want to get back on the winning track. We’re 0-3 in the last three games and we need a conference win. It would be huge for our confidence level. \n“You just have to make sure the team stays together. In a situation like this, guys can go in different directions. We just need to stick together as a team and be one together and that will help us. We’re a team that always sticks together, always plays tough. We’ll bounce back from this and get back on the right track.” \nKen Corbitt can be reached at (785) 295-1123 or ken.corbitt@cjonline.com .Follow Ken on Twitter @KenCorbitt .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:50:06.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
