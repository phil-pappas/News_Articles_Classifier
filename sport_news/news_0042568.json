In a notice to licensees, the Nevada Gaming Control Board stated that daily fantasy sports meets the definition of a game or gambling game. The announcement comes one day after reports emerged that the Department of Justice and FBI have launched an investigation into the legality of daily sports operators. FBI agents from the Boston office had reportedly started contacting customers of DraftKings, asking them about their interactions with the company, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday. The investigators were reportedly trying to determine whether daily fantasy sports games are a form of gambling. But daily fantasy operators, such as DraftKings and FanDuel, have insisted that they offer a game of skill, which makes it legal under terms of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006. The act prohibits financial companies from transferring money to online gambling sites, but so-called games of skill are exempt.\nTennis: Third-round winners at the Shanghai Masters included No. 1 seed Novak Djokovic , No. 4 Stan Wawrinka , No. 5 Tomas Berdych and No. 8 Rafael Nadal No. 12 Kevin Anderson took out No. 6 Kei Nishikori in straight sets that went to tiebreakers. ...
