(WYMT) -- If there is one way to Southwestern head coach Larry French’s heart, it’s Amon’s doughnuts. \nAmon's Sugar Shack in Somerset has provided French with the goods for a while now and he isn't shy about promoting his love from Amons. \nFrench has his No. 3 Warriors on a six game winning streak, but his doughnut streak stopped last week. \n\"Last week I didn't have any,” French, who is in his second season as the head coach, said. “I'm sure they probably had some reserved for me, but this week I may go back to eating a few more doughnuts. They are awfully good. I am going to tell you that much right now. And if you got a chance to eat one of their doughnuts, you need to stop in and get one. They've got other things there too that are pretty daggon good so ... I like them. Let's put it that way.\" \nFrench gets his sugar fix; Pulaski County head coach John Hines gets his TV fix. Hines is happy for his No. 1 ranked Maroons to have the chance to play the Warriors in a game televised LIVE by WYMT. \n“We are always excited to have you guys around, Jamie. You know that. We love having YMT come around and I know there's not a lot of folks that believe we belong in the mountains or the coverage-area, but we are thrilled to be in it and we are always excited to have YMT. It's going to be an exciting night. Not only the game and what it stands for, but to have it broadcast live just adds some extra excitement that we usually don't have.\" \nIf you are not going to be at the game, it will be televised LIVE on THIS-TV and WYMT.com Friday night. The game is set for 7:30 p.m. kickoff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:50:42.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
