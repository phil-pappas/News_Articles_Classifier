Our team now leaves Port Harcourt on Friday,Oct 23.” a tweet via ‏@NGSuperEagles states. \nGoals from Bature Yaro and Gbolahan Salami earned the Super Eagles a 2-0 victory on Saturday in Port Harcourt ahead of the return leg. \nThe winner of this tie will qualify for the competition scheduled for Rwanda next January. \nMeanwhile, Super Eagles coach Sunday Oliseh has called up Etim Matthew as replacement for Solomon Kwambe who is currently nursing an injury. \nThe Warri Wolves right back who starred for the Home Eagles in last Saturday’s first leg African Nations Champions (CHAN) 2-0 win over Burkina Faso in Port Harcourt is a major doubt for the second leg billed for Ouagadougou.
