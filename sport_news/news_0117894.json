They should be, considering how much Wilson once battled, not only to keep his job but to prove he should still play.\nHigh on the list of unlikely college football heroes is Wilson, a San Clemente High product who has led Utah to a No.3 national ranking. This is Utah, 23 months removed from a 5-7 season. This is Wilson, 23 months removed from being told by doctors that he might be risking his health by returning to the field.\nWilson is among 15 finalists for the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award – given to the top fourth-year or senior quarterback – and gets a final homecoming game Saturday, when the Utes (6-0 overall, 3-0 Pac-12) play at USC (3-3, 1-2).\n“I’m enjoying every second of it,” Wilson said in a phone interview this week. “It’s my last year here, so I want to enjoy everything. We’ve just got to keep on playing well and making sure we’re preparing right.”\nIn a conference presumed full of future NFL passers, out front is Wilson, a lanky, 6-foot-7 quarterback with an awkward throwing motion, a penchant for high-risk downfield runs and an impressive knack for winning.\nWilson’s style has been described as reckless, and leads him to be a persistent injury risk, but his growing consistency has the Utes in the national-title hunt.\n“He’s had some bumps in the road that held him back a little bit,” Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said, “but right now he’s playing his best football, without a doubt. When he’s throwing the football like he has been this year, it makes us much more balanced on offense and a much better football team overall.”\nWilson, a senior, isn’t particularly prolific. Among Pac-12 quarterbacks this season, he ranks 11th in yards per game (196), 10th in passing touchdowns (seven) and sixth in pass efficiency (140.5).\nYet there are no complaints. Utah has a stout defense and a run-heavy offense, which Wilson has led with effectiveness and intelligence. His 67.9 completion percentage is third-best in the Pac-12, he has thrown only three interceptions in 137 attempts and he ranks third in rushing yards among Pac-12 quarterbacks.\nThen there’s his winning spirit, the intangible that has helped Wilson in big games. On Sept.26, a week after he missed a game because of a shoulder injury, Wilson strolled into Autzen Stadium and led a 62-20 rout of Oregon. He passed for 227 yards and four touchdowns and ran for 100 yards and another score.\n“I think the biggest thing for Travis is that he’s been healthier,” Oregon coach Mark Helfrich said this week. “I’ve always thought he’s a tremendous player. He can run and he can throw. He’s hard to tackle. I think him staying healthy, for the most part, has really paid off for everybody. Except their opponents.”\nWilson’s September shoulder injury, sustained at the end of one of his mad-dash scrambles, was nothing compared to the challenge he faced as a sophomore in 2013, when he got a career-threatening diagnosis.\nA head injury led to tests, through which doctors discovered Wilson had a pre-existing injury to an artery in his brain. Wilson’s life wasn’t in immediate danger, but doctors made him sit the final month of the 2013 season and didn’t let him participate in any team activities through the following summer.\n“That really set him back,” Whittingham said. “He wasn’t able to do much. He couldn’t train for a long time there. They wouldn’t let him in the weight room. So that really impeded his progress and he wasn’t able to make strides in the offseason, like he would have wanted.”\nBefore the 2014 season, Wilson regained the starting job but struggled early in the season and shared time with Kendal Thompson. After Thompson suffered a knee injury, Wilson played the final four games and thrived. The Utes finished 3-1 and Wilson was the MVP of the Las Vegas Bowl.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:29:44.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
