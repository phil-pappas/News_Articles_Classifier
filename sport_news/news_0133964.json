Both hail from Amravati. Both had schooling from the same school - Gyanmata High School, both are passionate about chess and think only about how to improve their game on the chess board. \n\nNo wonder they are the faces of chess in Vidarbha. Deshmukh became the first International Master from the region, the feat which was emulated by Dhopade after few years. \n\nIn his hour of glory, Dhopade did not forget to mention the contribution of his former coach and mentor. \n\nThe 'Guru' himself is over the moon when he saw his 'Shishya' scaling the great heights in chess and became the first GM from Vidarbha. \n\n\"It is a phenomenal achievement. Hats off to him for this spectacular feat. For a small town boy joining the big league of GM Club is a special effort. I am so happy for him,\" said Deshmukh, who is also participating in the Pune tournament now and beat Dhopade in Round 7 on Saturday. \n\n\"It feels bad to beat him a day after he became the GM. In fact, it happened second time. When he was on the verge of becoming GM, he faced defeat from me around three years ago. These two wins over Swapnil were quite different from the normal wins as I know him ever since he started playing chess,\" said Deshmukh, an employee of LIC. \n\nRecalling his long association with Swapnil, Deshmukh said, \"I have guided him throughout his career. As a kid he had stayed at my home for many days. Whenever he sought my help, I was always there for the assistance. Not only chess coaching, I have guided him on the other aspects of life too. He is a quick learner and a sheer hard worker. He always kept his focus. There were ups and downs in his career but good habits and dedication helped him quell all the challenges,\" said Deshmukh. \n\n\"He is in the best form of his life. He has the potential to achieve more glory for himself and India. I have no doubt in my mind that he will cross the 2600 Elo rating points soon. The way he is playing these days, I will not be surprised if he wins big tournaments this year. The best is yet to come from Swapnil,\" added Deshmukh. \n\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:58:30.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
