(Image Source: Tony Ding/AP Photo) \nBig Ten East division power rankings following Week 4: \n(1) Michigan State Spartans; Record (1): 4-0 (0-0) \nLast Week: Won vs. Central Michigan 30-10 \nThey were out-gained by 15 yards the score was 17-10 in the fourth quarter, so I was tempted to knock the Spartans down a peg. It’s a tossup between MSU and OSU at this point. DE Shilique Calhoun came through with 2.5 sacks and a blocked FG (one of two MSU had). More concerning is the (“not season ending”) injury to LT Jack Conklin . \nComing Up: 10/3: vs. Purdue; 10/10: @ Rutgers \n(2) Ohio State Buckeyes (2); Record: 4-0 (0-0) \nLast Week: Won vs. Western Michigan 38-12 \nSo, QB Cardale Jones is the man ( J.T. Barrett was 1 of 3 off the bench) and he used his cannon arm to wrack up 288 passing yards. Eight different Buckeyes had a catch of at least 15 yards, including RB Curtis Samuel , who had a 40-yard catch and a 40-yard run. \nComing Up: 10/3: @ Indiana; 10/10: vs. Maryland \n(3) Michigan Wolverines (3); Record: 3-1 (0-0) \nLast Week: Won vs. BYU 31-0 \nThis was Michigan’s best effort of the season, top to bottom. There were no interceptions by Jake Rudock , they grounded-and-pounded the Cougars for 254 rushing yards and held No. 22 BYU to a shockingly low 105 total yards. \nComing Up: 10/3: @ Maryland; 10/10: vs. Northwestern \n(4) Penn State Nittany Lions (4); Record: 3-1 (1-0) \nLast Week: Won vs. San Diego State 37-21 \nQB Christian Hackenberg had by far his best game of the season completing 60 percent of his passes for three TDs and no INTs. The three forced turnovers—one returned for a TD—also played a big role. RB Saquon Barkley (left game in second quarter) made some special moves, both as a rusher and after the catch. \nComing Up: 10/3: vs. Army; 10/10: vs. Indiana \n(5) Indiana Hoosiers (5); Record: 4-0 (0-0) \nLast Week: Won @ Wake Forest 31-24 \nWith 168 yards, RB Jordan Howard has run for at least 145 yards in every game this season. At 4-0 (7 th time in IU history and first time since 1990) and with games remaining against Rutgers, Maryland and Purdue it’s bowl or bust. Wake Forest isn’t a powerhouse but they’ll take a Power 5 road win in Bloomington any day. \nComing Up: 10/3: vs. Ohio State; 10/10: @ Penn State \n(6) Rutgers Scarlet Knights (7); Record: 2-2 (0-1) \nLast Week: Won vs. Kansas 27-14 \nSophomore backs Josh Hicks (113 yards, 2 TDs) and Robert Martin (102 yards) both topped the century mark as Rutgers out-rushed the Jayhawks 312 yards to 64. But that was against a Kansas team that is 0-3 and will likely make a run at a winless season. Context means a lot in college football. \nComing Up: 10/3: Idle; 10/10: vs. Michigan State \n(7) Maryland Terrapins (6); Record: 2-2 (0-0) \nLast Week: Lost @ West Virginia 45-6 \nIn the past three games Caleb Rowe has thrown two, three and now four interceptions giving him nine in just 64 attempts. On the season, three Maryland QBs are completing just 50.4 percent of their passes. Just as many suspected this is going to be a long season for the Terps. \nComing Up: 10/3: vs. Michigan; 10/10: @ Ohio State \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
