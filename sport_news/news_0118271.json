The BU Bearcats men's basketball team, for example, has been working out and training together throughout the summer and for the better part of the fall semester. But, there's still a different level of excitement that comes with the first official day of practice. The Bearcats hit the floor at the Events Center for team's first official practice Friday at 4:00. Tommy Dempsey took to Twitter prior to practice expressing his excitement saying: \"Since I started bouncing a ball when I was 5 yrs old the first day of practice has always had a special feel! #excited.\" Similarly, Marlon Beck tweeted: \"1st Day of Practice.. Tis The SEASON \" The Bearcats return Beck and Yosef Yacob, who Dempsey said last year he sees as the captains of the team, as well as sophomores Willie Rodriguez, Bobby Ahearn, Justin McFadden, Romello Walker, and Dusan Perovic. Perovic missed most of last season after tearing his ACL and was at practice Friday in a rather bulky knee brace. Despite the brace, he was moving well and apparently pain free, no doubt a positive sign for the Bearcats. BU opens the season on the road on November 13 against St. Bonaventure. Fox 40 will have more preseason coverage of the Bearcats as the team's Media Day is scheduled for Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:01:09.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
