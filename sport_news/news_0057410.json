Family members and friends filled the parking lots and tents covered the lawn of the Barnstable Fairgrounds on Saturday night as though it was the Fourth of July on Boston’s Esplanade. For Massachusetts high school cross country runners, this was their Woodstock. It was a seemingly endless day of competition, beginning in the full sun of the afternoon at 3 p.m. with the freshmen races, continuing into twilight with the junior varsity events and finishing beneath a black sky as the varsity teams raced through the woods and under the lights to clanging cowbells and raucous cheers. The race course even included a short run through a barn that was decorated with Halloween lights. This was the fifth year of the Massachusetts State Track Coaches Association Invitational at Barnstable Fairgrounds, and the competition has become something far beyond who wins and who loses. It is now an event, in italics and capital letters. “It’s the most successful meet we run in terms of competitors and spectators,” says Frank Rooney, executive director of the MSTCA. “We have schools coming here from as far away as the Mohawk Trail [in Western Mass.]. Why? One reason might be that we’re the only high school cross country invitational in America that is run under the lights.” Joe Chadick brought one such school. The coach of Mohawk Regional in Shelburne Falls had heard about the unique invitational, so he decided to bring his team, even though the round-trip meant six hours of driving. “I wanted to see what it was like. We’d never run under the lights before,” he said. What he discovered was a carnival atmosphere. Brightly-colored flags lined the 3.1-mile route, as did spectators. Action was taking place seemingly everywhere, with competitors cheering on their classmates, tossing balls, playing games, listening to music and visiting booths that showcased all sorts of running apparel. John and Lucia Carroll know a little something about special events. They were heavily involved in running the Falmouth Road Race for years. On Saturday night, John announced the competitors as they came across the finish line and Lucia manned the registration desk. “This has become more and more popular every year,” Lucia said. “It’s a novelty to run under the lights. And the course is very spectator friendly; you can see the kids from every spot.” The MSTCA brought in 15 portable banks of lights for the event, which translated into a hefty electric bill. “But it’s worth it,” Rooney said. “We charged $5 per family, because we want entire families to come, and that helped us pay for the lights.” The atmosphere provided fuel to runners looking to post personal bests, such as Nauset Regional’s Hannah Bryant and Olivia Bois. Competing in the Division 1 girls’ varsity race, Bryant lopped two minutes from her best time, while Bois shaved off 30 seconds. Both attributed their success to the spectator support. “It’s incredible how many people are lining the entire course,” Bryant said. “It’s an amazing feeling. It really pushes you to go faster.” Bois agreed with her teammate. “The energy is really good and it gets you in the right mode to do your best,” she said. Other Cape Cod schools competing were Bourne, Barnstable, Mashpee, Sturgis, Sandwich, Dennis-Yarmouth, Saint Pope John Paul II and Monomoy Regional. There isn’t a price to be placed on something unique. Saturday night’s MSTCA Invitational was just that. “It’s a very special venue for the kids,” said Rooney, who brought his Seekonk High squad. “The kids love it. I got on the bus today and they were singing songs. They were high as a kite to come here because it’s so much fun.” Of note, Nauset’s Brian Brooks won the boys sophomore race in a course record time of 15:55.2, breaking the record of 16:16 set in 20:12.
