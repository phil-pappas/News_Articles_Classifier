Point guard Norris Cole is out at least six weeks with a high ankle sprain, while guard Tyreke Evans is sitting out the next preseason game with knee soreness. \n“We’ve got a rash of injuries right now,” said Pelicans coach Alvin Gentry, who noted that Evans will have his knee looked at. \nThis marks the 11th season of Robinson’s career. He played in 42 games last year with the Los Angeles Clippers and Denver Nuggets. \n“We’re just looking for him to come in & be part of the team,” said Gentry on adding Robinson. “We’ll see how it goes from there.” \nA 3 time slam dunk champion, Robinson has displayed high athleticism and a propensity for high energy plays during his career. \n“Coach (Gentry) just said to play with energy and be yourself and play your game,” explained Robinson. “He’ll let me know if I’m doing too much.” \nRobinson will wear #2 for New Orleans.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:01:39.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
