Illinois teams are guaranteed a postseason bid when they reach the six-win mark. The loss kept the Thunder one win away from that plateau. \nGalena, tied with conference rival Forreston for 10th place in the Illinois Class 1A AP poll, jumped to a 20-0 lead, with Scharpf scoring the second touchdown on a 3-yard run, then adding a 2-yard scoring run with 6 minutes, 49 seconds left in the second quarter. \nEthan Mangler, who rushed for 99 yards and two TDs for the Thunder (5-3, 4-3), put them on the scoreboard when he scored on a 5-yard run with 1:14 left in the half. \nWest Carroll never got any closer, though. \nMangler broke off a 73-yard run to pull West Carroll within 27-12 with 3:06 left in the third quarter, only to see Galena's Caleb Flack return the kickoff 85 yards for a score. \nWest Carroll closes the season next Friday against Lena-Winslow, the No. 1-ranked team in Class 1A. A win would put the Thunder in the playoffs, but if they lose they would need enough points (opponents' wins) to get in with five wins. \nGALENA 49, WEST CARROLL 28 \nWest Carroll 0 6 6 16 — 28 \nGalena 14 6 15 14 — 29 \nG — Ethan Sasek (Adrian Jimenez kick), 5:51 \nG — Bruce Scharpf 3 run (Jimenez kick), 1:40 \nG — Scharpf 2 run (PAT failed), 6:49 \nWC — Ethan Mangler 5 run (Mangler run), 1:14 \nG — Hunter Holland 27 pass from Alex Townsend (Jimenez kick), 4:17 \nWC — Mangler 73 run (PAT failed), 3:06 \nG — Caleb Flack 85 kickoff return (Dalton Bauer pass from Townsend), 2:50 \nG — Scharpf 5 run (Jimenez kick), 9:29 \nWC — Kody Plattenberger 7 run (PAT failed), 5:55 \nG — Jordan Kirchner 25 run (Jimenez kick), 5:29 \nWC — Kaleb Plattenberger 56 pass from Ko.
