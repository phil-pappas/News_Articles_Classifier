However, the park has not been named, so the City has launched a Public Park Naming Contest.\nCitizens are able to submit two options in the Joplin Public Park Naming Contest, and should include the two names for consideration and a brief description of why the name is appropriate for the park. Entry cards to submit your recommendations are available at the Joplin Athletic Complex, Main Lobby of Joplin City Hall, and the Reference Desk of Joplin Public Library. Submissions should be delivered or mailed to Joplin Park Naming Contest, Attn: Planning, 4th Floor, Joplin City Hall, 602 South Main, Joplin, Mo., 64801. Citizens can also email the entry information to parknaming@joplinmo.org or call 417-624-0820, ext. 541. All entries are due by 5 p.m. Monday, November 9, 2015.\nDiscussion and final selection of the park name will be completed be a staff committee. The person who submitted the selected name for the park will be recognized, as well as participate, in the groundbreaking ceremony for the park. The date of this event is to be determined.\nThis 16-acre park will include native landscapes and green space with trails, a large pond, restrooms, and pavilion. It will be located on land that was part of the former location of St. John’s Regional Medical Center and was donated to the City by Mercy Hospital. The park should be completed by May 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:01:52.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
