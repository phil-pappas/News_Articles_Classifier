Just look around the country. I think being in the New York market probably amplifies it a little bit but whether it's been Florida State or Louisville or Miami or any of our schools, there have been issues over time and they get played out.\n\"Where those issues normally get played out is NCAA processes and school processes. The conference commissioners are not far removed but they are not in the decision-making line on personnel issues.''\nThe statement comes a little more than three weeks after university President Robert Barchi suspended Scarlet Knights football coach Kyle Flood for three games and fined him $50,000 after an investigative report concluded that he violated school policy by contacting a professor to discuss a player's grade.\nAsked whether he was concerned that Flood's violation compromised the university's academic integrity, Delany said: \"The first thing I would say is that the issue has been resolved. There was a violation of institutional policy. And there's accountability on it. You may think it should've been one game or you may think it should've been five games or something else. But the fact of it is, it was reviewed, it was reported, and it was disposed of. So that's rear-view mirror. I'm looking going forward.\n\"I would say that Rutgers has earned the reputation for great academics, not only in their student body but in their intercollegiate programs. So this is an exception to that. They have been at the very top in terms of student-athlete performance by any metric you can measure. I'm sure the coach is sorry that it happened the way that it happened. I'm sure if he had to do it over again, he wouldn't.''\nRELATED: Does Jim Delany regret adding Rutgers to the Big Ten?\nDelany, who will attend the Scarlet Knights' 8 p.m. clash Saturday versus No. 4 Michigan State, said he believed Flood \"paid his price'' and called it \"old news.''\nStill, Rutgers hired a Kansas City-based law firm with expertise in NCAA infractions to help identify potential rules violations early on in the independent investigation of Flood's actions. That review, multiple officials told NJ Advance Media earlier this week, has evolved into a top-to-bottom investigation as the football program deals issues that include an allegation that a recently arrested player failed multiple drug tests.\nDelany said the Big Ten has no plans to assist with the current investigation that is expected to conclude with a final report that will determine if NCAA rules have been violated.\n\"Basically on personnel issues and NCAA issues, if our opinion were asked, we'd be glad to do it,'' Delany said. \"We do some education in that area. We have some expectations. But if somebody wants to bring in a third-party to look at their program for whatever purpose, that's their call.\n\"If they wanted my opinion, I would give it to them. They haven't asked for my opinion. And I'm not sure that my opinion is all that different than everybody else's opinion. It's uninformed, not factual, and I've got plenty of confidence in the Board, the President and the AD that they'll get things going in a good way.''\nDelany said the challenges that Rutgers faces aren't unique throughout the college landscape.\n\"There have been some wrinkles, but I've been here for 26 years and with 14 institutions, I can't tell you there is not an institution that hasn't had a difficult time from time to time,'' Delany said. \"I'm confident that the decisions being made are fact-based and rationale and I'm looking forward to the time that it calms down a little bit.\n\"When things don't go well you feel for them as people but there also is accountability for the athlete and the coach and everybody who is in the ecosystem — for the media, for the schools. We all have workplaces and we all have families. The difference is if you are a student-athlete or a coach, you are a public figure. That has a lot more scrutiny than being another member of the public. These are big institutions with big brands and lots of followings so I wish that it was smoother but I think that we'll get processed.''\nA South Orange native who still has New Jersey roots, Delany said his goal is to attend an event in every sport that the Big Ten sponsors over the next 12-to-18 months.\nAlthough Barchi is apparently out of town, Delany said he plans to meet with Rutgers athletics director Julie Hermann and various administrators from both Rutgers and Michigan State before Saturday's football game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:49:01.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
