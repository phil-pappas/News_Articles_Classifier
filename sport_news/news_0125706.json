As per usual, the Pirate relays were among their strongest results, finishing first in the 200 and 400 M Freestyle relays, taking second in the 200 Medley relay and third in the aforementioned 400 M Freestyle relay. “The 400 Freestyle Relay in the last couple of meets has been the Pirates’ strongest of relays,” Melbye said. “They really showed strengths with both the A and B teams finishing towards the top.” Melbye also highlighted the 200 IM as a strong event for Crookston. “Both Thea Oman and Elizabeth Erdman represented the Pirates Swim Team extremely well,” Melbye said. “They are both swimming really well and every time they start a race it is anyone’s race.” In fact, there were several performances that Melbye highlighted on a night in which the Pirate coach was quite pleased with how the team stepped up to the challenge of the Spuds. “Sierra Pry had a great 500 swim, cutting nearly 10 seconds,” Melbye said. “She came bound and determined to achieve her goal and really tackled the 20 length of the pool.” Melbye also went on to note more about Erdman’s performance on Thursday. “Elizabeth had an extraordinary meet last night, “ Melbye said. “She had two personal bests in both her 200 Individuals Medley and the 100 Butterfly. Elizabeth is extremely dedicated to swimming and in her career will go far.” The Pirates have a week off before hosting the conference meet at the Crookston Community Pool next Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:54:45.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
