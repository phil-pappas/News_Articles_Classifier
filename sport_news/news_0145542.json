He compiled a 163-161 record in two seasons in Seattle, including a 76-86 mark in 2015. He has a 499-607 career mark as a major league manager with the Pittsburgh Pirates (2001-2005) and Seattle. He was under contract for 2016. \nMariners executive vice president and general manager of baseball operations Jerry Dipoto also announced that batting coach Edgar Martinez and infield coach Chris Woodward have been invited to return to the coaching staff. In addition, pitching coach Rick Waits and coach Chris Prieto have been invited to return to the Mariners organization. \nDipoto, hired on Sept. 29 after previously serving as general manager with the Los Angeles Angels, was given authority to determine McClendon's fate. Dipoto clashed with the on-field coaching staff with the Angels before he resigned during the 2015 season. \n\"I have a great deal of respect for Lloyd, as a person and as a manager,\" Dipoto said in a statement. \"It is a credit to his professionalism that the team continued to play hard through the final day of the season. However, after extensive conversations it became clear to me that our baseball philosophies were not closely aligned. On behalf of the Mariners I want to thank Lloyd and his staff for their hard work the past two seasons, and I wish him the best moving forward.\" \nBench coach Trent Jewett, third base coach Rich Donnelly, outfield coach Andy Van Slyke and bullpen coach Mike Rojas also will not be returning to the Mariners.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:03:23.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
