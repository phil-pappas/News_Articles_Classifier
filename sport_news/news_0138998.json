Comment   Will Gilbert Posted Oct. 4, 2015 at 4:46 PM Updated at 5:02 PM Posted Oct. 4, 2015 at 4:46 PM Updated at 5:02 PM Heber Springs Heber Springs junior William Rubio, who was airlifted to Children's Hospital in Little Rock after he was critically injured in the team's bus accident following Friday's game at Stuttgart, is currently listed in serious but stable condition. The football team visited Rubio Sunday afternoon at the hospital. Rubio reportedly sustained a broken jaw and pelvic bone in the accident, which was caused by a deer running under the steering column of the bus two miles north of Rose Bud. Rubio is expected to be released in two weeks. Eight other Heber Springs students were injured in the accident. Look for additional information in Wednesday's edition of The Sun-Times.
