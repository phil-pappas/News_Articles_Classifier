(WYMT) -- The WYMT Appalachian Wireless Game of the Week is in Somerset Friday night, as No. 1 Pulaski County hosts No. 3 Southwestern. \nThe Maroons have been the top-ranked team in the Mountain Top 10 all season long. \n“Around here, Jamie, it's always the game of the year,” Pulaski County head coach John Hines said Sunday. “Regardless of any other games you play or who you play or what the stakes are. When Pulaski and Southwestern get together, it's kind of like Auburn and Alabama if you will. It's an inner-county war and it happens only once a year.” \nBoth teams are 7-1 entering this game. Pulaski’s loss is to Scott County; Southwestern fell to Bourbon County back in August. \n“It really and truly doesn't matter because we are going to play the game between the white lines. If we are looking at the cameras, we are going to get our tails beat,” Southwestern head coach Larry French said. “We just got to go in there and focus on what Pulaski County does offensively, defensively and in the kicking game. And we just got to play football. If we don't execute on offense and defense, then they are going to win the football game. But if we can execute, then we got a shot at winning and it should be a good football game.\" \nKickoff time is set for 7:30 p.m. and the game can be seen LIVE on THIS-TV and WYMT.com, with highlights Friday night on Sports Overtime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T08:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:07:43.905+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
