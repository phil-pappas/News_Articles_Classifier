Saturday October 24, 2015 \nSharing community and high school contributed stories Sunday October 25, 2015 October 24, 2015 | 2:01 pm \nCEDAR RAPIDS — The Jefferson J-Hawks called on the hardest hitter they could. \n“If (superintendent Brad) Buck couldn’t get it done, I don’t know if anybody could have,” Jefferson football coach Brian Webb said Saturday morning. “I think (the Iowa High School Athletic Association) would have said no to Governor Branstad.” \nThe IHSAA denied Jefferson’s request to play its Class 4A first-round playoff game at Kingston Stadium on Wednesday. Instead, the J-Hawks (6-3) will face Dubuque Senior (4-5) at Ash Park on the campus of Cornell College in Mount Vernon. \nThat game will start at 5:30 p.m. as the front end of a double-header. Mount Vernon (7-2) will face Dyersville Beckman (6-3) in a 2A first-rounder at 8 p.m. \n“Cornell has been great to work with,” said Jefferson AD Chris Deam. “Of course, we would have loved to have gotten the opportunity to play at Kingston.” \nCedar Rapids Kennedy (9-0) is the champion of 4A District 5, and Cedar Rapids Washington (8-1) captured the crown in District 6. Both of those teams call Kingston home, too, and they got priority to host Wednesday over the J-Hawks, the District 5 runners-up. \nKennedy faces Clinton (5-4) at 5:30; Washington meets Cedar Falls (6-3) at 8. \nThe IHSAA did not want to put three games at Kingston. \n“What they kept telling us was that it came down to they didn’t want to take teams out of class,” Deam said. \nIronically, some of the teams that participated at the state-qualifying cross country meets Thursday got out of school early. Many of the IHSAA’s state competitions take place on weekdays during the school year. \nDeam pleaded the J-Hawks’ case, and so did Buck, to no avail. \n“They didn’t budge. It is what it is,” Webb said. “I think some of the agenda is driven by revenue.” \nJefferson’s next option was to play at Coe College, but “they host volleyball (Wednesday), so we called Cornell and they opened their arms to us,” Deam said. \nThe J-Hawks have posted their first winning season since 2001. \n“It’s a testament to our seniors,” Deam said. “They’ve been with Coach Webb four years. They took last year (a 4-6 record and a playoff berth) and ran with it.” \nWELCOME BACK, STRANGERS \nJesup is back in the playoffs for the first time since 2003, and the J-Hawks put a bow on a 6-3 regular season with a 35-33 upset win over Dike-New Hartford, the Class 1A District 4 champion. \nThe 2003 trip was Jesup’s only previous playoff appearance. Winners of three straight games, the J-Hawks seek their first postseason win Wednesday when they play at Saint Ansgar (8-1). \nBenton Community is making its first postseason trip since 2008; the Bobcats will face West Delaware (9-0) in a Class 3A encounter. \nEast Buchanan’s most recent appearance had been in 2009. The Buccaneers are at Gladbrook-Reinbeck (7-2) in Class A. \nJUST LIKE CLOCKWORK \nIowa City Regina and Lisbon have qualified for the 12th consecutive year, the longest active streaks among area schools. \nRegina (8-1) begins pursuit of its sixth straight title when it faces Bellevue (4-5) in a Class 1A contest. The Regals own a 25-game postseason winning streak. \nLisbon (7-2) hosts Lone Tree (6-3) in Class A. Lisbon’s run included a state championship in 2011. \nCedar Rapids Kennedy, which completed its first 9-0 regular season in school history, and Solon (5-4) have pushed their playoff streaks to 11 years. Cedar Rapids Xavier (8-0) is in the postseason for the 10th year in a row. \nStatewide, the longest active streak belongs to West Des Moines Valley, with 24 straight appearances. \nl Comments: (319) 368-8857; jeff.linder@thegazette.com Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T22:18:08.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
