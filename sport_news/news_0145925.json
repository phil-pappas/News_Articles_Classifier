(AP Photo/Mike Roemer) Posted: Friday, October 2, 2015 9:20 pm FANTASY FOOTBALL FEVER: Don't despair, the season is young By Jim Titkemeyer The Daily Progress To those of you with the good fortune (or high fantasy football IQ, if you prefer) to have selected one of the top 10 performers in Week 3, hat's off to you. Here's a look at the week's top performances: RB Devonta Freeman (37.30 points); QB Aaron Rodgers (34.92 points); WR A.J Green (34.70 points); WR Steve Smith (30.60 points); QB Andy Dalton (30.32 points); QB Cam Newton (29.90 points); RB Joseph Randle (28.50 points); WR Julio Jones (28.40 points); WR Randall Cobb (28.30); and RB LeGarrette Blount (27.20 points). To the rest of you, who don't own any of those top 10 but did have them used against you (like me), all I can say is hang in there. Fantasy football is not for the weak at heart. One thing to keep in mind is that most fantasy football seasons are 13 weeks long, and we have only completed three. So, if your record is not that great at the moment, there is plenty of time to recover. The ultimate goal is to have your team in position to win it all after Week 13. With that in mind, let's take a look at some players who could help your team this week, especially those of you with key players on bye (Patriots and Titans). Quarterbacks : Both the Bills' Tyrod Taylor (21 of 29 for 277 yards and 3 TDs) and the Raiders' Derek Carr (20 of 32 for 314 yards and 2 TDs) continue to impress. Both have great matchups in Week 4. Taylor faces a poor Giants defense, and Carr against an even poorer Bears defense. If you need a quarterback and they are available, I suggest you pick one of them up. If not, another possibility is the Jets' Ryan Fitzpatrick, who draws the surprisingly woeful Dolphins defense in London this weekend. Running backs: In this chronically difficult position to fill there are several quality players out there in many fantasy leagues. These include the Cardinals' Chris Johnson (22 rushes for 110 yards and 2 TDs plus 40 yards receiving) and the Bills' Karlos Williams (12 rushes for 110 and a TD). Johnson resembles the runner he was several years ago, and both should start this weekend. If you want to take a chance that Marshawn Lynch is still out, backup Thomas Rawls ran for 104 yards on 16 touches in Week 3. For those of you who started Redskins RB Matt Jones in Week 3, do not panic. He remains one of the fastest and strongest running backs in the NFL. His time is coming. Wide receivers: The Dolphins' Rishard Matthews caught six passes for 113 yards and 2 touchdowns last week, Bengals WR Marvin Jones caught 5 passes for 94 yards and a score, and Jaguars WR Allen Hurns collected passes worth 70 yards and a touchdown. All three are secondary receivers on their teams, but also seem to have won favor with their respective quarterbacks. Tight ends: There are an abundance of quality players at this position in most leagues. For example, the Washington Redskins' own Jordan Reed hauled in eight balls for 96 yards in Week 3. He now has had 26 targets in three games so far, yet is owned in only 18.3 percent of fantasy leagues. Other strong candidates include the Bills' Charles Clay (5 receptions for 85 yards and a TD) and the Ravens' Crockett Gillmore, whose current status is \"doubtful,\" but he had five receptions for 88 yards and two touchdowns in Week 2. Defenses: If you stream defenses, here are some good candidates this weekend: the Cardinals at home against the Rams, the Packers away against the 49ers and, for the truly courageous, the Redskins' defense at home against a (to date) weak Eagles' offense. Jim Titkemeyer has been a fantasy football fanatic (some would say an \"addict\") since 1995 with considerable success. The purpose of this column is to promote discussion and (hopefully) help you win your league as well.
