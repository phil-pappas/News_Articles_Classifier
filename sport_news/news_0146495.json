Welcome to October in New Jersey.\nBelow, we present three things to watch for when Monmouth hosts ex-Northeast Conference rival Bryant.\n1. The run game: If passing becomes a problem in adverse conditions, the running games for both teams could become major factors. Monmouth is averaging 133.5 rushing yards per game (78th nationally), while giving up 132.8 per game. That latter statistic is solid when looking across the country as it ranks Monmouth 29th nationally among 123 FCS teams and third in the Big South. On the other side, Bryant is averaging 109 rushing yards per game (96th nationally) and is yielding 134 per game, which is 33rd nationally. Junior running back Lavon Chaney, an All-Big South selection last season, is Monmouth’s leading rusher at 241 yards and four touchdowns.\n2. Limit the penalties: All told, Monmouth has done a good job limiting penalties compared to the rest of the country. Through four games, the Hawks have been penalized an average of 6.5 times per contest, which is inside the top half amongst all FCS teams, and third in the Big South. However, penalties did not help Monmouth’s cause at Fordham last week as it was penalized a whopping nine times for 100 yards against the Rams. Making those stats an anomaly would be in the Hawks’ best interest.\n3. Keeping tabs on Cody Williams: The redshirt sophomore quarterback had his most productive effort as a collegian on Sept. 19 at Wagner, going 23-for-34 for 243 yards and a touchdown. Last week at Fordham, he was 15-for-29 for 154 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions. On Wednesday, Hawks head coach Kevin Callahan went as far as to say that the consistency and execution at quarterback hurt Monmouth after steady improvement through the first three games. How Williams responds Saturday will be a focal point. For the season, the Springfield, Mass native is 79-for-129 (61.2 percent) for 769 yards, three touchdowns and six interceptions.\nStaff writer Josh Newman: jnewman4@gannettnj.com\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1RjWaex", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:09:25.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
