By Rick AndersonThe Daily World \nEven without his customary victory, Aberdeen’s Kyle Hurd was happy — and drenched — at the end of Hoquiam’s Grizzly Alumni Association Cross Country Invitational. \nSo were Ocosta’s girls and Elma’s boys. Not to mention Elma’s Wesley Allen and Willapa Valley’s Traci Hoffman. \nTwin Harborites fared extremely well against tough competition in the Grizzly Alumni Invitational on Saturday at rainy, blustery Sea Breeze Oval. \nHurd ran second to Mountlake Terrace’s Braeden Sims in the boys meet. Allen led the Class 1A contingent with a fifth-place finish. \nWell-balanced Ocosta, meanwhile, took small-school girls team honors and placed third in the all-classification team standings. With 95 points, the Class 2B Wildcats trailed only Class 3A Mountlake Terrace and 4A South Kitsap and finished ahead of several upper-division teams. \nElma earned the small-school boys team title and placed fifth overall. Franklin of Seattle was the overall team champion. \nConditions were far from ideal, to put it mildly. The meet-opening frosh-soph race was conducted in a torrential downpour. The rain eased off by the time the girls varsity race began, but returned with a vengeance — and was accompanied by strong winds — by the start of the varsity boys event. \nAlthough dominant against Class 2A and 1A competition this season, Hurd wasn’t at all disappointed with his second-place finish. Nor was the Aberdeen junior fazed by the adverse weather. \n“I don’t think it was that bad,” Hurd contended. “If anything, I think it’s refreshing to run in.” \nHurd was only a couple of strides behind Sims as the runners came off the fire lane behind the high school for the first time. Sims, however, pulled away in the final third of the 5,000-meter race and won comfortably in 16:24.56. Hurd was clocked in 16:35.51. \nAllen, demonstrating his customary finishing kick, ran 16:55.96 — a bit faster than his previous best time in this meet. \n“If the weather had been better, I think he could have run 16:20,” Elma coach Dave Beeler said. \nElma also received top-30 finishes from Brody Burbidge (25th) and Tucker Holcomb (27th). The latter registered a significant personal-best time of 18:33.50. \nElma’s Maddi Clark won the frosh-soph girls race. \nThe girls varsity contest turned into a Mountlake Terrace invitational. The Hawks swept the first five places, led by individual champion Ella Schroth in 19:26.74. \nOcosta also ran in its customary packs for most of the distance. Kathryn Anderson led the Wildcats by taking 13th with a lifetime-best 21:11.69, but her father and coach Aaron Anderson was exceptionally pleased with all of his performers. Five other Wildcats (Sararose Gallo, McKenzie Ballo, Kelsey Gundersen, Rachael Saul and Alexi Most) cracked the top 30. \n“As a team, everybody ran solid and it wasn’t exactly ideal racing conditions,” said Coach Anderson, himself a Hoquiam alum. “Mentally, they’re tough.” \nAmong the Ocosta boys, Alex Bailey ran a personal best. \nTwin Harbors individual female honors went to Willapa Valley’s Hoffman, who overtook numerous rivals in the homestretch to take ninth in 21:01.78. \n“That was a performance, that was a race,” Willapa Harbor coach Brad Donovan exulted. “Maybe she likes really bad weather.” \nHoquiam’s Alexis Delahanty ran with the leaders for the opening stages before finishing a very respectable 20th. \n“She did great, I’m really proud of all (my runners),” first-year Hoquiam head coach Carly Giles said. “This was a day to have fun, not a day for PRs. They all pushed through and ran hard.” \nDespite the weather, Saturday’s meet represented a renaissance of sorts for the venerable meet. After several years of declining participation levels, even among Twin Harbors teams, the meet drew 97 boys and 71 girls — many from upper-classification schools — on Saturday. Montesano, which had Homecoming activities, was the lone Twin Harbors absentee. \nBOYS \n1. Braeden Sims (Mountlake Terrace) 16:24.56. 2. Kyle Hurd (Aberdeen) 16:35.51. 3.
