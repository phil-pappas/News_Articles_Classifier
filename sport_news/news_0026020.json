He was magnificent in the lineout and around the field in attack and defence, delivering an astonishing work-rate and showing immense leadership qualities. \nSAM WARBURTON (Wales) \nWales captain Warburton was a model of consistency throughout the tournament, but against quarter-final opponents South Africa he went up another gear. A master of the breakdown and a ferocious tackler, openside flanker Warburton was at his brilliant best, going toe-to-toe with the physical Springboks forwards. Wales, though, were undone by South Africa skipper Fourie du Preez's late try, suffering a 23-19 defeat that meant they finished short of matching their semi-final achievement in New Zealand four years ago. \nWorld Cup team of the quarter-finals: 15 - Ben Smith (New Zealand); 14 - Juan Imhoff (Argentina), 13 - Conrad Smith (New Zealand), 12 - Juan Martin Hernandez (Argentina), 11 - Julian Savea (New Zealand); 10 - Nicolas Sanchez (Argentina), 9 - Fourie du Preez (South Africa); 1 - Marcos Ayerza (Argentina), 2 - Dane Coles (New Zealand), 3 - Owen Franks (New Zealand), 4 - Richie Gray (Scotland), 5 - Brodie Retallick (New Zealand), 6 - Schalk Burger (South Africa), 7 - Sam Warburton (Wales), 8 - Duane Vermuelen (South Africa).
