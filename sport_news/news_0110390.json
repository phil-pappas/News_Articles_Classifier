Oregon tight end Pharaoh Brown (85) is tackled by Washington linebacker Shaq Thompson (7) the last time these two teams met on Oct. 18, 2014 in Eugene, Ore. The Huskies lost to the Ducks, 45-20. Ryan Kang AP file photo, 2014 i Order Reprint of this Story SEATTLE \nIt had been rumored for a while, but their fans were delighted when it became official: Simon and Garfunkel, the estranged singing duo, announced in September 2003 that they would reunite for a final tour that fall and winter. \nThey played 30 shows across the United States, including a stop in Seattle at a sold-out KeyArena on Nov. 1, 2003 — the same night the Washington Huskies blasted the Oregon Ducks, 42-10, before a crowd of 72,450 across town at Husky Stadium. \nSimon and Garfunkel, it turned out, would tour again, teaming up for shows in Asia and Australia in 2009. \nThe Huskies, meanwhile, are still waiting for their next win over the Ducks, the count of consecutive Oregon victories now at 11. \nSo it is that the old friends renew their rivalry on Saturday, meeting at Husky Stadium for a 7:30 p.m. game that all of a sudden seems to present a reasonable chance for the Huskies to end their tortuous losing streak to Oregon. \nFor the first time since that game in 2003, the Huskies enter as betting favorites (by 2 1/2 points). And despite a season-opening loss at Boise State and a frustrating defeat to California, the Huskies somehow enter this game with a better record than Oregon, which has limped to a 3-3 record and has already lost two Pac-12 games — both at home. \nThe Ducks can still move the ball — they rank 16th nationally in offensive yards per play — but they don’t throw it like they did when Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota was playing quarterback, and they haven’t played much defense, either, allowing more points per game (38.7) than all but two other Power Five conference teams. \nCombine those surprising shortcomings with Washington’s equally surprising 17-12 upset victory at USC last week — the Huskies were 17-point underdogs — and a belief is born that suggests UW might finally, actually, really have a chance to beat the team by which it has been dominated for the last 11 seasons. \n“Hopefully, we can make it a rivalry,” UW defensive backs coach Jimmy Lake said. “Because right now, the last decade, it’s been one-sided.” \nBut if Oregon truly is down, Huskies coach Chris Petersen doesn’t see it. \n“They’re one of the leading teams in the country in scoring points,” said Petersen, who was in his third season as Boise State’s offensive coordinator the last time UW beat the Ducks. “They run the ball as well as anybody, and they’ve got a really good play-action pass game. So, to me, it’s the same old Oregon team.” \nHe’s not wrong. Oregon tailback Royce Freeman, a bruising sophomore with uncommon speed for a man who stands 5-foot-11 and 230 pounds, has rushed for 859 yards and nine touchdowns on 123 carries this season. Despite the Ducks’ problems at quarterback — Vernon Adams, who transferred to Oregon from Eastern Washington, could shore up those issues by returning from a finger injury — they still run the ball at hyperspeed. \nAccording to Lake, Freeman is “fast, got great vision, he’s big, he’s elusive. The SEC gets all their hype, just like they do every single year. I’m just telling you right now: I know a lot of NFL scouts. Royce Freeman is the best running back in the country.” \nTackling him — and keeping up with Oregon’s fast-paced offense — will be a priority for the Huskies, who limited USC to just 346 yards of total offense last week but still allowed the Trojans’ top two tailbacks to average 7.1 yards per carry. \n“We (need to) just go in there and just try to stuff it and just play our technique,” said senior linebacker Travis Feeney, who won Pac-12 defensive player of the week honors after recording seven tackles and 2.5 sacks against USC. “Nobody try to do other people’s jobs and just do your job. Everybody swarm and tackle.” \nThat’s not something they’ve done well against Oregon. Feeney recalls last season’s 45-20 loss in Eugene: “I look at that game and I get frustrated and I just want to be able to put up a better fight.” \nAnd, they hope, their first win against Oregon since thousands swayed to “Bridge Over Troubled Water” in the building where the Sonics still played. \nYeah, it’s been a while.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:04:01.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
