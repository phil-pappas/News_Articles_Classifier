Southeast ended their Senior Night with a hard-fought loss to Galena, who ruthlessly topped the Lancers 49-0 Friday evening. With the loss, the Lancers fall to 0-7 in the regular season and 0-2 in district play. “We put forth valiant effort,” Coach Jerrad Hansen said. “We kept playing.” In the first minute of the game, seniors Cameron Paasch, Chandler Jackson and starting quarterback Dylan Lawrence made small gains before the Lancers were intercepted by the Bulldogs, who quickly scored their first touchdown of the game. After the ensuing extra point for a 7-0 score. Galena continued their lead, scoring two of their touchdowns in the first four minutes of the game. The Bulldogs put up five touchdowns and a field goal in the first half of the game to head into the locker room with a dominating lead. The Lancers began the second half having yet to cross midfield. Though there were no points on the scoreboard by the Lancers, several seniors, who were honored prior to the game — made important plays throughout the game. Lawrence effectively reduced the Bulldogs yards gained throughout, making two tackles against Galena losses within the first half. Tucker Mosley and Colton Paasch both prevented the Bulldogs from scoring a touchdown at the end of the first quarter, only to have Galena score another touchdown and PAT at the opening of the second quarter, bringing their lead to 27 points. ‘We are going to keep trying,” Hansen said. “I want my seniors to win.” The second half continued uneventfully for the Lancers, but they continued to make small gains throughout. With 9:20 left in second quarter, Austin Hunt blocked a pass from Galena’s quarterback, forcing a field goal attempt, which was good, to make the score 30-0. Lawrence blocked a field goal attempt with 3:38 left in third quarter to keep the Bulldogs off the scoreboard for the moment. UP NEXT Southeast goes up against Cherryvale on Friday to end their regular season schedule.
