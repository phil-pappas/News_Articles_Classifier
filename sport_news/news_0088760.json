Photo: Getty Images\nBogut texted Hayne when he originally transitioned to the NFL, despite not knowing him, to try help him settle into his new surroundings.\nAdvertisement \"I just reached out to him once he came here, he was by himself â€¦ he didn't really know anybody, so I just tried to catch up with him,\" he said. \"(I wanted to) make him feel a little bit at home, come and hear an Australian accent.\"\nBogut still feels that the US audience is yet to appreciate how big Hayne was in rugby league.\nFlying high: Golden State Warriors centre Andrew Bogut.

People don't understand he was the equivalent to LeBron James in Australia for rugby,\" he said.\nHayne's switch has been compared to Michael Jordan's famous, if very short-lived, baseball career in the early 1990s. Bogut said that while the comparison is apt, Hayne has faced a far tougher transition.\n\"You look at MJ, he had actually played baseball, but this guy had never played football, never wore shoulder pads,\" he said. \"To come out and not only make the team but to actually get playing time is pretty impressive.\"\nBogut believes that despite being on a lower salary, Hayne is still in the frame for a great career in the NFL. \"He just has to keep working and he'll eventually get his shot.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T21:02:53.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
