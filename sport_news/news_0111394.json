Sunday was no exception. For 49 minutes, that is. The Patriots, who were missing running back Dion Lewis and guard Shaq Mason, and utilizing a third-string tackle, were limited to 16 points, 10 first downs and 205 yards through three quarters as the Jets’ top-ranked defense lived up to its pregame billing and made the Patriots work overtime for every yard of turf at Gillette Stadium. “They’re just tough,” Brady said. “They put a lot of pressure on you with the scheme.” Then the Patriots did what they’ve done so often over the years: adjust accordingly and on the fly. Resourceful and resilient, persistent and -- most important -- productive, the Patriots erased a four-point, fourth-quarter deficit and went on to post a 30-23 victory that raised their record to 6-0 and expanded their lead in the AFC East to two games. “We made some plays when we needed to in the fourth quarter,” Brady said. “It wasn’t exactly like we drew them up, but it was good that we made it happen when we needed to.” The plan was rewritten early in the final frame. Brady handed off five times all game, the last coming when running back LeGarrette Blount went wide right for a seven-yard loss with 10:51 left to play. At that point, the decision was made to not only ditch the run altogether, but also the no-huddle approach that had been liberally utilized. The Patriots slowed down the pace as Brady worked out of an empty backfield and in the shotgun with five pass catchers at his disposal in tight end Rob Gronkowski and receivers Julian Edelman, Danny Amendola, Brandon LaFell and Aaron Dobson. “We tried to spread them out so they couldn’t blitz us as much,” LaFell said. “They manned up a lot and from there it was just picking the matchups and seeing what they give you,” Amendola said. What the Jets got was a whole lot of Brady. Brady was 22-for-39 for 219 yards and no touchdowns with three sacks before the Patriots spread out the Jets. He was 12-for-15 for 136 yards and two touchdowns with no sacks over the final 11 minutes while engineering the 48 th successful fourth-quarter comeback of his Canton-bound career. Page 2 of 2 - “In the fourth quarter we did a few different things and made some more plays, so it was good to win,” Brady said. The biggest play of the game from a turning-point standpoint -- Jets cornerback Antonio Cromartie called it “the backbreaker” -- came when Brady found Edelman over the middle for 27 yards on third-and-17 two plays after Blount was buried. Like the decision to switch up the offense, Edelman’s catch was a result of some on-field improvising. Edelman got safety Dion Bailey to think he was going to continue running straight down the field. Once the Jet defender turned his hips, Edelman broke off his route. Brady made the split-second read and successfully delivered a potentially game-saving pass. “So, it was a good play,” Brady said. “Jules made a real smart play. It’s not exactly how we drew it up. I think there were a lot of plays like that today that weren’t exactly how we drew it up. But I was glad to make some of those key plays when we needed to make them.” Brady hooked up with Amendola over the middle on an eight-yard scoring strike five plays later to put the Patriots on top, 23-20, with 7:16 left to play. After a four-and-out series by the Jets, the Patriots got the ball back at their own 32. Ten plays and just over four minutes later, Brady connected with Gronkowski on a 15-yard touchdown toss to extend the lead to 30-20. Gronkowski had six catches for 53 yards through the first three quarters and five receptions for 55 yards and a TD in the fourth. Getting Gronkowski more involved offensively also proved to be a sensible strategy. “Whatever Josh sees and whatever is called, we just have to go out there and execute,” Gronkowski said. “A lot of times we can go off the game plan and we’re ready because we work hard in practice and go over everything.” The Jets have frequently caused problems for Brady & Co. and Sunday was no exception. The only problem for the New Yorkers was that the game lasted 60 minutes and not 49, as the Patriots adjusted accordingly and came away victorious.
