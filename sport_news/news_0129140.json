Albert Cesare / Advertiser (Photo: .) \nAUBURN — Auburn tailback Roc Thomas continued his injury-plagued 2015 season as he returned to practice Sunday. \nThe sophomore tailback needed help getting off the field in the second quarter and did not return to Auburn’s 30-27 victory at Kentucky Thursday night after the undisclosed injury. Thomas has been battling foot and ankle injuries since the season opener in Atlanta against Louisville. \n“It just tends to be the same thing kind of nagging him over and over again,” Auburn offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee said Sunday. \nThomas got his first start at tailback since Auburn’s 31-24 victory over Louisville in the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game in Atlanta. Thomas, the former Mr. Football selection in the state of Alabama, was utilized early on perimeter runs before Auburn went back to the inside-out combination of Auburn's leading rusher Peyton Barber and freshman Wildcat running option Kerryon Johnson . \nJohnson had his first career touchdown run on a six-yard carry on a third-down wildcat call in the first quarter to give Auburn a 14-7 lead. The touchdown was Johnson’s first career score in a Auburn uniform and was Auburn’s 11th rushing touchdown of the 2015 season. Johnson would finish the first half with 97 total yards (52 on returns, 31 rushing and 14 receiving). \nThomas got the opening play of the game on a three-yard carry and finished the first half with eight total yards on four carries. Auburn showcased three tailbacks in the opening quarter. Thomas lost the starting tailback job to Barber and had received just 23 total carries since the opener and has been used more a receiver out of the backfield. The sophomore from Oxford, Alabama came into Kentucky Thursday night second on the team with 163 yards and one touchdown. \nLashlee said he anticipated Thomas would be available to play this weekend as Auburn (4-2, 1-2 in Southeastern Conference) travels to Arkansas (2-4, 1-2 in SEC) for an 11 a.m. matchup Saturday on SEC Network. In last year’s 45-21 victory over Arkansas, Thomas did not see any action. \n“He was out there (Sunday) and we’ll just see kind of how he goes this week, and hopefully he’ll be ready to contribute,” Lashlee said. Auburn OC Rhett Lashlee talks about Kentucky win and Arkansas matchup.
