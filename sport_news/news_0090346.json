However, Malzahn said Tuesday they refuse to force passes to him around two defenders. \n“You got to understand within an offensive system, there’s progressions and there’s reads,” Malzahn said. “A lot of times if they’re double-covered, the quarterback should go somewhere else where somebody else is open.” \nAuburn (2-2, 0-2 in Southeastern Conference) has one of the least dynamic offenses through four games and one of the major reasons has been a lack of getting their best receiver involved early in games. Williams, who entered the 2015 season as a potential first-round draft pick, has just 11 catches and one touchdown that came late in a blowout loss at LSU. Last season, Williams had that number of receptions doubled through three games. \nWilliams was part of a drama-filled preseason camp that included the senior wide receiver missing six practices due to what the program was categorizing as a discipline issue but was reinstated to his starting position before the season opener. Williams has not been made available to the media by Auburn officials throughout the 2015 season. \nMalzahn said in his weekly media session that this difference is just “part of the offensive system” and not an issue where Williams “is doing wrong or he needs to do better”. The problem is that offensive system is ranked 112th in the country at an average of 344.3 yards per game. That offensive system has gotten Malzahn accused by fans of the opponents knowing the Tigers signals from the sidelines. \n“We need to be a little more creative to get guys open,” Malzahn said. “At the same time when you’ve got a new starting quarterback there’s a little bit of want to make sure that he’s comfortable.” \nWith Auburn going to Sean White at quarterback, the redshirt freshman has been looking over the “three to five” progressions” Malzahn says are in a given play call, and turnovers have been lowered before White is valuing possessions compared to the first three games with Jeremy Johnson behind center. \n“There’s a balance there,” Malzahn said. “I believe we only turned the ball over one time the other night, which I thought was a step in the right direction, especially the first few games when we had three turnovers and all that, and with a new starting quarterback only turning it over one time.” \nWhite said after the 17-9 loss to Mississippi State that he didn’t feel comfortable executing some of the options in the vertical passing game because of the Bulldogs’ safeties playing deep prevent coverage. \n“That’s part of what the coaches teach us,” White said Saturday night. “They were playing deep so you look to the middle of the field for opportunities. The deep ball just wasn’t there a lot.” \nLashlee said during the week the decision was being made to possibly give White his first career start that the 6-foot, 200-pound quarterback had the same handle on the offense as Johnson. However, after throwing just a couple of passes over 10 yards in the air Saturday night, Malzahn admitted Auburn’s confidence in White will increase throughout the season. White will get another start vs. San Jose State Saturday (3 p.m., SEC Network) against a struggling defense and seemingly the perfect opportunity to get on page with their star receiver. \n“There are times in certain situations that you’re going to throw it to somebody even if they’re double-covered if you feel comfortable with that and if you feel comfortable with your quarterback,” Malzahn said. “We haven’t had the explosive plays we’ve had in the past. That’s what we need to do as coaches, figure out a way to manufacture those things with our guys and within our system.” 1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1KNWPCE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T03:42:21.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
