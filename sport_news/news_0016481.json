CHRIS CARLSON , THE ASSOCIATED PRESS A sign advertises the Love Ranch brothel, in Crystal, Nev., where former NBA star Lamar Odom was found unconscious Tuesday. CHRIS CARLSON , THE ASSOCIATED PRESS SEND PDF \nPAHRUMP, Nev. – The employee who called 911 after Lamar Odom was found unconscious Tuesday told authorities that the former NBA star had taken cocaine three days earlier. \nNye County Sheriff Sharon Wehrly said that her office was actively investigating the incident, but declined to comment on whether they believed Odom was the victim of an overdose. \nOdom remains at Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas, where he has been visited by Lakers star Kobe Bryant and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. \nJackson said Wednesday morning that Odom's estranged wife, Khloe Kardashian, has been at Odom's bedside. \nWehrly said detectives served a warrant early Wednesday morning that allowed them to draw blood to test for drugs. The results of those tests might not be known for several weeks, she said. \nRichard Hunter, the media director at Dennis Hof's Love Ranch South in nearby Crystal, Nev., was the second brothel employee to call in the medical emergency. \nHe relayed that Odom had taken cocaine on Saturday, but did not know if he had taken any drugs after that. \n“He apparently had some cocaine on him that he finished on Saturday,” Hunter said. “Hopefully one had nothing to do with the other there.” \nThe 911 tapes were played at a Wednesday news conference. The woman who initially called authorities described Odom as having “blood coming out of his nose, white stuff coming out of his mouth.” \nThe dispatcher instructed those on the scene to turn Odom onto his side. \nInvestigators said Odom took 10 doses of an herbal sexual enhancer over his three-day stay at the ranch. The herbal product was provided to Odom at the ranch, a detective said. It is believed to be legal. \nWehrly said brothel employees could potentially face charges if they are found to have provided illegal drugs or misled investigators. \nContact the writer: boram@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:29:57.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
