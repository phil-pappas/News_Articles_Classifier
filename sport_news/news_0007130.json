ISLANDERS 4, PREDATORS 3\nThe Islanders' early-season schedule has been a gauntlet.\nThey opened with a home-and-home series against the Stanley Cup-champion Blackhawks on consecutive days last weekend only to return to Brooklyn for matchups with two other Western Conference playoff teams: the Jets on Monday and the Predators on Thursday. In the meantime, the Isles have been forced to adapt to a new arena and travel schedule while playing without their starting goaltender, Jaroslav Halak, who remains out with an upper-body injury.\nBut the Islanders gutted through the daunting stretch and capped it off with a 4-3 win over Nashville Thursday night before 10,542 at Barclays Center. They erased a 2-0 second-period deficit, capturing their second straight victory behind a game-winning goal from Nikolay Kulemin.\nIntially, though, the Isles came out sluggish. They didn't put a shot on net until almost halfway through the opening period. And they surrendered a soft goal just more than two minutes into the game when Marek Zidlicky swiped the puck into his own net trying to clear it out of the zone.\nCorey Sipkin/New York Daily News Captain John Tavares scores the last of four straight goals by the Islanders Thursday night. Austin Watson was credited with the goal. Goaltender Thomas Greiss denied the forward on several rebound opportunities but eventually let the puck slide through and glide across the goal line, where Zidlicky was waiting.\nThe Islanders upped their intensity over the final 11 minutes of the first period, producing a few solid scoring opportunities, but Predators goaltender Pekka Rinne - who allowed just two goals in three games entering Thursday night - denied them all.\nDespite the Islanders' late push, Nashville held a 17-7 shots advantage after the first 20 minutes.\nGreiss struggled with his rebound control again early in the second period, and again the Predators capitalized. This time Greiss mishandled a James Neal snap shot that deflected off the goaltender and nearly trickled over the goal line. John Tavares rushed to the puck and cleared it away, but seconds later it was pushed back in front of net and Filip Forsburg poked it past Greiss to extend Nashville's lead to 2-0.\nCorey Sipkin/New York Daily News Backup goalie Thomas Greiss has been filling in for the injured Jaroslav Halak. As he has all season, though, Tavares had the answer for Isles. Less than a minute later, the captain collected a pass behind the goal after working hard along the board, wrapped around the left side of Rinne and passed to Anders Lee through the crease. Lee buried a one-time shot into the back of the net to cut the deficit to one goal.\nSix minutes later, the Islanders knotted the game a 2 when Kyle Okposo got behind the Predators defensemen, gloving down a loose puck in the neutral zone before breaking away and beating Rinne high with a delayed shot.\nThe teams entered the second intermission tied, but the Islanders pulled away in the final period despite trailing substantially in shots on goal.\nWith just more than 13 minutes remaining in regulation, Kulemin put the Isles ahead for good, collecting a Brock Nelson shot that caromed off boards behind the net and finishing. Then Tavares added an insurance goal after a stagnant power play, slotting a loose puck in front of net.\nNeal pulled the Predators within one inside six minutes, deflecting a Forsberg shot past Greiss. But the Islanders held on to improve to 2-1-1 on the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:09:35.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
