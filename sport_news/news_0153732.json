(Photo by Chris Trotman/Getty Images) Axalta Coatings Systems will continue its longstanding partnership with Hendrick Motorsports by becoming a primary sponsor of Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s No. 88 Chevrolet SS team for 13 Sprint Cup Series races annually, beginning in 2016.\nAdChoices Axalta, which is picking up three extra races as a primary sponsor, will also be featured as a major associate sponsor during all non-primary events.\nThe agreement extends a multi-faceted partnership -- now in its 23 rd full season -- that began in November 1992 with Hendrick driver Jeff Gordon.\nFor most of Gordon's career, DuPont Performance Coatings was one of the many DuPont divisions that supported the No. 24 Chevrolet. Axalta acquired that DuPont subsidiary in February 2013, after which Axalta replaced DuPont as one of Gordon's primary sponsors.\nGordon, who is in his final full-time Sprint Cup campaign, will continue to work with Axalta as a spokesperson and global business advisor. The multi-year relationship with the four-time champion was announced earlier this year.\n\"We began a journey 23 years ago with Hendrick Motorsports and a young driver named Jeff Gordon. Eighty poles, 92 wins and four championships later, we are proud of the run we've had with Jeff,\" said Nigel Budden, Axalta vice president and head of its North America business. \"Now, we are delighted to continue our relationship with Hendrick Motorsports and to adorn the hood of Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s No. 88 Chevy SS with the Axalta logo in 2016. As our slogan says, 'We Paint Winners,' and by joining Dale we will continue to do so for years to come.\"\nAxalta has hosted thousands of customers at events and fashioned some of the most iconic paint schemes in NASCAR history. Earlier this month, Hendrick Motorsports and Axalta broke ground on Axalta's 45,000-square-foot Customer Experience Center that will be located on the Hendrick campus in Concord, North Carolina.\n\"Axalta has built a model sponsorship program,\" said team owner Rick Hendrick. \"For 23 years, they've recognized the opportunities NASCAR provides and understood how it drives value for their business. It's a unique relationship that's evolved with the times and has been consistently effective. We're very proud of what we've accomplished as partners and look forward to more successes together with Dale and the No. 88 team.\"\nEarnhardt, 40, has 25 career Sprint Cup victories, including two this season. The Kannapolis, North Carolina native recently clinched a fifth consecutive appearance in the championship-deciding Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup.\n\"Axalta and Hendrick Motorsports have an incredible story,\" Earnhardt said. \"For me, it's meaningful to work with a sponsor that's been so committed to our sport and has such a rich history in NASCAR. Continuing the partnership is special for all of us, and I'm already excited about what the car will look like. I'm really looking forward to the opportunity.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/nascar/story/hendrick-motorsports-axalta-jeff-gordon-rick-hendrick-sprint-cup-series-090915", "http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T19:47:11.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
