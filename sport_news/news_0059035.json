(AP) - A New Jersey woman must get her two parrots to quiet down after the birds gave someone something to squawk about.\nElaine Scattergood was ticketed in May after someone complained that her birds, Edmund and Arthur, were too loud.\nScattergood tells The Press of Atlantic City ( http://bit.ly/1KI21rJ ) she would place the parrots on the porch of her Avalon home because people like them. She says people would say hello to the birds and the parrots would reply with a greeting.\nA judge on Monday told Scattergood the noise complaint will be dismissed if there are no violations reported in the next 90 days.\n___\nInformation from: The Press of Atlantic City (N.J.), http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1KI21rJ"], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T03:06:14.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
