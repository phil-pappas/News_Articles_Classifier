He made his collegiate debut with a pair of punts Oct. 3 at Georgia Tech. That came in the Tar Heels’ most-recent game. Lent had punts of 28 and 32 yards and another one partially blocked, though it was recorded at 22 yards (and is listed as a team punt). Until that game, redshirt freshman Corbin Daly punted the other nine times this season, averaging 34.3 yards per attempt (with a long of 52 yards). “We’ve got a competition going on between those two guys right now, and we haven’t gotten any consistency at the position,” coach Larry Fedora said. “That thing is still a work in progress, so we’re still competing there.” The Tar Heels have punted only 12 times across five games. “I didn’t think either punter graded out very well,” Fedora said. Lent’s first punt was fielded as a fair catch at the Georgia Tech 15-yard line. In the fourth quarter, he had a 48-yard boot from his own end zone that was wiped out by an illegal formation penalty before the 32-yarder. For Saturday night’s game against visiting Wake Forest, Lent shares the top spot on the depth chart with Daly. Junior Joey Mangili is listed third. A decision is pending about who’s preferred. “Not that I know of,” Fedora said when asked if a pecking order had been established. “On Saturday, we’ll put somebody out there.” For the last home game against Delaware, the Tar Heels never punted. “I believe we were going to go with Lent with the first punt in that game,” Fedora said. Not all has been sour about the Tar Heels’ punting. They’re the only team in the country that hasn’t had a punt returned against them.
