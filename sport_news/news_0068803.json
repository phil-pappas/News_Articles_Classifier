While the Wildcats are quickly going through quarterbacks, TCU plays the second of three Big 12 road games in a four-week span that coach Gary Patterson calls the most important stretch of the season. The Horned Frogs finally get an open date after K-State and then a trip to Iowa State. After Oklahoma State's final-minute field goal to beat K-State 36-34 last week, coach Bill Snyder's team probably can't afford another loss and still have any realistic chance in the Big 12 race. They can't afford to lose another quarterback either, having already seen four quarterbacks go down to injury and a fifth to illness.\nBEST MATCHUP: No. 21 Oklahoma St. (5-0, 2-0) at West Virginia (3-1, 0-1). Talk about equally matched teams, though the Mountaineers took a devastating blow when senior safety Karl Joseph sustained a season-ending knee injury during practice this week. WVU averages 38.5 points a game, just better than the Cowboys' 38.2 points, while the Mountaineers average 499.8 total yards a game, slightly ahead of the Cowboys' 483.2 yards. West Virginia is the best Big 12 scoring defense, allowing 16.8 points per game, while Oklahoma State gives up 19.2 points.\nINSIDE THE NUMBERS: No. 10 Oklahoma (4-0, 1-0) is going for its ninth 5-0 start in coach Bob Stoops' 17 seasons. The Sooners are more than two-TD favorites Saturday in the Red River Rivalry against Texas (1-4, 0-2), which is off to its worst start since 1956 and gave up 50 points at TCU last week. ... TCU's Trevone Boykin and Baylor's Seth Russell are tied for the FBS lead with 19 touchdown passes.\nLONG SHOT: Considering that No. 3 Baylor (4-0, 1-0) is averaging a nation's-best 64 points a game, and Kansas (0-4, 0-1) has scored only 88 all season, it would take a monumental upset for the Jayhawks to get their first win of the season. Baylor won 60-14 last season and is favored by more than 40 points against Kansas, which has lost its last 19 games against Top 25 teams â€” by an average margin of 30 points.\nIMPACT PLAYER: Mike Warren, getting an unexpected chance, has rushed for 301 yards in Iowa State's past two games. He is the first freshman in school history with consecutive 100-yard rushing games. The Cyclones (2-2, 1-0) on Saturday play at Texas Tech (3-2, 0-2) the league's worst rushing defense allowing 277 yards per game.\n___\nCompiled by AP Sports Writer Stephen Hawkins in Fort Worth, Texas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:02:46.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
