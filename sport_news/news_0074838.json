He added a 2-yard touchdown run with 3:27 left in the third quarter for the Spartans’ only second-half points. \nIn a game where both offenses went no-huddle and marched up and down the field almost at will in the first half, it looked like whatever team had the ball last might come away with the victory. \nHowever, the Spartans (4-2) couldn’t keep pace, turning the ball over on downs on both of their fourth-quarter possessions. \nThe Spartan offense was firing on all cylinders, running 45 plays in the first half and scoring on four of its five possessions. Fassnacht was 14 for 20 passing for 180 yards in the first half. His completions included a 13-yard touchdown pass to tight end Brent Whelton,. \nHowever, in the second half, Fassnacht was just 6 for 13 for 70 yards and one interception. Half of his second-half passing yards came on one fourth-quarter toss to Whelton. \nThe Spartans clung to a seven-point lead at halftime when Viking receiver Alec Freeman scampered 42 yards as time expired but was ruled down inside the 1-yard line when he dove for the end zone at the end of the run. St. Laurence (4-2) argued the call, but to no avail.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:45:07.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
