Decades ago, I was posted in the newly opened college in the remote Karsog valley in Himachal. The Pandavas had spent some time in exile at Karsog. Legend has it that the demon Bitrasura roamed in this valley, devouring inhabitants, hence sog (grief). It was Bhima who killed this demon in a fierce fight during which they uprooted trees and threw boulders at each other. These boulders in the soft earth of paddy fields are now where jackals congregate and howl in moonlit and moonless nights. I lived in a stone and mud house with slated roof and a wooden verandah, and here, families living in adjacent quarters, would assemble after dinner for story sessions, often about witches, ghosts, demons, gods and goddesses. They told me that one of the favourite perching places of witches at night was my place. It so happened that due to a local holiday, my neighbours, whose spouses were working in the tehsil office, went away to their respective nearby villages. The landlord and his family too were away to attend a function and I was all alone. In front of me was the vast open valley with cascading paddy fields, criss-crossed by small rivulets, a delightful sight to watch any day. At night, hundreds of jugnoos twinkled like tare zameen par. But this night was the night of the storm. Indra Dev was furious, throwing thunderbolts across the sky, lightening tearing the clouds, which in turn collided with each other. The screeching and howling wind was trying to rip apart the windows while the rain battered the doors. The trees were swaying violently as if demons had possessed them, while the crescendo of the jackal howls was unnerving. All alone in the wilderness, I did not know what to fear — the two-legged man, four-legged animals or legless ghosts. Buried in my quilt, I looked at the improvised diya as I had exhausted the meagre stock of candles. Just then, I saw a small mouse poking its head out of a hole near the cupboard, cautiously making its way to the packet of bread. It was my turn to lie still as a mouse. When it was sure that there was no danger around, it started nibbling at the bread, unmindful of the fierce storm outside, and at peace with itself. What solace it was to see a living creature! I had always believed that one shaped one's destiny, but that night changed my views on destiny. What was I doing in this wilderness, away from home and family? Why had I left a permanent job in the capital town and had come to take up this teaching assignment in a remote valley? Was it my destiny? In whose hand was the destiny of every individual? Is it God, whose existence was recently debated in a seminar at the Indian Institute of Advance Study, Shimla? The search goes on. But now I believe that whatever has to happen will happen. Our future is not in our hands, or for us to see. We will do what destiny has in store for us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:05:13.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
