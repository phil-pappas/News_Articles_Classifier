(Photo: PTI) Kolkata: Pele on Monday left everyone mesmerised in an evening that had moments of nostalgia, the great debate on Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi, even as the King of Football from Brazil declared that he was willing to help Indian football in some way.\nBrazilian football legend Pele near a life sized model presented to him during an interaction session with the students of NSHM Knowledge Campus in Kolkata. (Photo: AP)\nPele said that his Argentine rival Maradona was a more complete player than Messi as he interacted with former India cricket captain Sourav Ganguly, Oscar winning musician AR Rahman and members of the 1977 Mohun Bagan team against whom he had played in an exhibition match in 1977.\n\"If I can help some way, I'll be here. No problem,\" he said, replying to the captain of the then Mohun Bagan team Subrata Bhattacharya during a glittering evening titled the 'Legends Tour of India'.\nPele interacts with students. (Photo: AP)\nOn India's slip in standard of football, he drew parallel with Brazil hosting the 1950 World Cup at home. \"Today, Brazil have excellent reputation but it was not the same in 1950. Brazil lost the World Cup at home and everyone kept criticising. You need to have patience. You need to get experience.\n(Photo: AP)\nIndia have excellent opportunity to grow in football. You need more exchange of experience. You have a lot of talents. It will take a little time,\" he said.\nPele shows off his skills. (Photo: PTI)\nPele came on the stage with a walking stick and was given a standing ovation by the 1000-odd audience. \"I accepted to come here in India because I love the people here. I played 25 years with Brazil and Santos and then five years with New York Cosmos. The surgery was done only recently when I stopped playing,\" he said.\nPele receives a pencil sketch from a student. (Photo: PTI)\nPele had three surgeries this year but despite that he's touring the world, spreading the message of peace through football. \"Thank you God to give me this moment. I thank everyone who made this possible. People have worked very hard to give me this opportunity. Some of the people present here I know were not born when I had come here 38 years ago. Now, I'm glad to be back here with the new generation,\" he said.\nLegendary Brazilian footballer Pele greets West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee as Sourav Ganguly and A R Rahaman look on at a function in Kolkata. (Photo: PTI)\nThere were also questions about who's the greatest and who’s better between Maradona and Messi. \"Both have same style. Both are very good but to me, Maradona was more complete than Messi who's the best in last 10 years,\" he said.\n(Photo: PTI)\nAsked whether there could be another Pele and he has his patent answer: \"Listen, I'm sorry. My father and my mother closed the machine. There's no Pele.\n(Photo: PTI)\nEvery place where I go, people want to compare. George Best in new Pele, Maradona, every place where I go they want to have a new Pele,\" he explained.\n(Photo: PTI)\nAsked about the making of a champion by former India captain Ganguly, he said: \"You are born to do something, that's the gift from God. Maybe to sing, to do medicine or play.\n(Photo: PTI)\nThis is a gift. My father used to tell me to play football, this was a gift from God. Now you have to be responsible, have to be in shape. Thank God what He gave to you. You must respect it, always do training and work hard to be on top but never ever think you're the best. You always have something to learn,\" Pele asserted.\nThe legend Pele is in Kolkata after 38 long years.We are indeed very happy to have him with us on the eve of Durga...\nPosted by Mamata Banerjee on Monday, October 12, 2015 Pele termed his third World Cup win in 1970 as his best memory. \"It was special because in 1958 a lot of people and media said I was a young player. That time the responsibility was on the former players and they took it up. To me it was a dream. But after playing four World Cups, my last one in Mexico in 1970 was like God's gift for me. I was the most experienced player, it was my last my World Cup. I told God, please help me I cannot lose this World Cup. The last one was the most difficult for me,\" an emotional Pele said.\nWith the awesome @Pele in Calcutta...! pic.twitter.com/vNJ3fLSxxr\n— A.R.Rahman (@arrahman) October 12, 2015 There was a special Mohun Bagan segment where he felicitated the batch of 1977, except the trio of Mohammad Habib, Mohammad Akbar and Sudhir Karmakar.\nGreetings from India! pic.twitter.com/x9lRG1ONod\n— Pelé (@Pele) October 13, 2015 The Mohun Bagan members who were present included Shibaji Banerjee, Dilip Palit, Dilip Sarkar, Crompton Dutta Chaudhury, Subrata Bhattacharya, Gautam Sarkar, Prasun Banerjee, Biswajit Das, Bidesh Bose, Shyam Thapa, Manas Bhattacharya, Dilip Sen, Shankar Banerjee, Haroon Mondal.\nI am here in Kolkata - the City of Joy - to mark the arrival of the Durga Puja festival, reuniting with old friends and making new ones.\n— Pelé (@Pele) October 13, 2015 Pele gave a warm hug to legendary PK Banerjee who was the coach of 1977 Mohun Bagan team.

Maybe they have made a mistake but I don't remember that,\" he said about the refereeing.\nI want to thank god for giving me the opportunity to travel this distance, for only the second trip of my life to India.\n— Pelé (@Pele) October 13, 2015 Showering praise on Pele, Ganguly said: \"I've played three cricket World Cups. There's a big difference being a winner and a runner-up. To hold that World Cup and a few Golden Boots must be a phenomenal achievement.\"\n\"Those knees have taken quite a few tackles. To see him so fit is amazing,\" he added.\nPele at a Durga puja pandal in Kolkata.
