Moments later, after a great exchange of passes Paulo Dybala sent a superb left-footed curling effort just wide of Rico's right-hand post.\nMidfielder Sami Khedira , making his first appearance since hobbling off 25 minutes into a pre-match friendly with Marseille, was making a great impression on the 32,908 spectators given his two-month absence from competition.\nThe German was given rousing applause when he deftly chested down a long ball at the left byeline to set up Dybala, but the Argentinean wasted the opportunity in front of goal.\nSevilla went on a rare counter when skipper Jose Antonio Reyes stole possession from Morata to set up Kevin Gameiro , but it came to nothing.\nJuventus finally broke the deadlock on 41 minutes when Morata rose above the Sevilla defence to meet Cuadrado's delivery from the right byeline and beat Rico down low at his far post. It was Morata's second goal in the competition this season after his late winner at Manchester City.\nJuve resumed where they had left off after the interval and created two quick chances immediately after the restart.\nGiorgio Chiellini's long ball from midfield found Dybala on the run but the diminutive striker's deflected toe poke was blocked by Rico's legs, while Pogba found space and time to fire a bicycle kick effort well over the crossbar from the edge of the area.\nCuadrado's movement and pace was too much for French left-back Benoit Tremoulinas, and on 64 minutes the on-loan Chelsea forward skipped by two players to set up Patrice Evra deep on the left but the Frenchman's low delivery for Dybala yards from goal was deflected out.\nEmery made two quick substitutions, Ciro Immobile replacing Gameiro and Vicente Iborra coming on for Steven N'Zonzi, although the changes made little difference.\nSevilla spent the next 10 minutes ball-watching as Juventus passed around at will, until Cuadrado broke the monotony with a vicious drive from outside the area that Rico did well to block.\nJuve coach Massimiliano Allegri replaced Morata with Zaza in the dying minutes and the Italy international seized his chance in style.\nDybala did well to hold off his markers to send the Italian on a long run that ended with his angled strike beating Rico down low on 87 minutes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:27:35.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
