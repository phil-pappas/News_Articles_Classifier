That's what rivals do, especially in a town where those on the east side believe those on the west side, whose school was once referred to as the \"Emerald City\" by a former Springdale coach, have the advantages. \nThe renewal of tonight's football rivalry comes days after the news that two more Springdale basketball players have decided to transfer to Har-Ber. Fans at Jarrell Williams Bulldog Stadium will also readily recognize the quarterback for Springdale Har-Ber as the same player who wore the uniform of the Springdale Bulldogs last season. \nSo, sure, Springdale High wants badly to beat Har-Ber. The question is whether the Bulldogs can pull it off. \nSpringdale's challenge would be harder had the Bulldogs not won last week to end a 16-game winning losing. Nothing does more for a team's confidence than finally winning a close game after so many failures. Plus, the Bulldogs are even with the Wildcats at 1-0 in the conference. \nHar-Ber will score, much like it did last year during a 41-34 shootout over the Bulldogs. Springdale can counter with playmakers, especially junior receiver Kyler Williams, but the Har-Ber defense is a much-improved unit that's allowed only one touchdown in the past two games. \nSpringdale will continue to improve under coach Zak Clark and the Bulldogs may even make the playoffs this year. But Har-Ber has won eight consecutive in this series and I don't expect that to change. \nStill, this is a matchup fans in the football-crazy town of Springdale won't want to miss. \nRICK'S PICK: Springdale Har-Ber \nOther games involving teams from Northwest Arkansas (selections are capitalized). \nCLASS 7A/6A \nBENTONVILLE at Fort Smith Northside \nFort Smith Southside at FAYETTEVILLE \nSPRINGDALE HAR-BER at Springdale", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:38:03.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
