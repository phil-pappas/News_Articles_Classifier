Barrett coming in inside the red zone, where the offense struggled through the first quarter of the season. \nAnd utilize a dual quarterback system Meyer did, as Jones and Barrett both engineered touchdown drives in the top-ranked Buckeyes' 49-28 win over the University of Maryland (2-4) at Ohio Stadium on homecoming Saturday. \nJones completed 21 of his 28 attempts for 291 yards with a pair of touchdown throws, and Barrett accounted for 62 yards and three rushing touchdowns in the Buckeyes' victory, their nation-best 19th straight and conference-record 26th consecutive regular-season win against Big Ten competition. \n\"J.T. is just a very good player,\" Meyer said in his postgame press conference. \"We've been having some red-zone issues and the Q run, everything condenses so much in there. Either you have to be extremely accurate, which we're going to continue to work at that in the throwing game -- or the run game, you have to somehow find an extra hat. \n\"That's only done a couple of ways. That's option football or Q run to equate numbers. He provided an obvious spark for us in there. Of course, he's a leader and a guy that needs to be on the field. \" \nBarrett rushed for a three-yard touchdown that drew the Buckeyes even with the Terrapins, 7-7, with 4:23 left to play in the first quarter. \nAfter Jones rushed for a gain of eight yards down to Maryland's 25-yard line, Meyer made the switch to Barrett, and he immediately continued moving the ball down the field. Following Barrett's six-yard rush, the Buckeyes committed a five-yard penalty and lost a yard on back-to-back rushes. However, on third-and-16, Barrett threw a 20-yard pass to wide receiver Michael Thomas, which gave Ohio State a first-and-goal from Maryland's five. \nTwo plays later, Barrett called his own number on the quarterback draw, rushed up the middle of the field and dove through Maryland defenders to reach the end zone for the touchdown, his first rushing score of the season, and finish off what was a 14-play, 75-yard drive for the Buckeyes. \n\"It was great,\" Jones said of two-quarterback system. \"It was all within the coach's plan, and he felt J.T. would bring an extra element to the game down in the red zone and with certain things we want to do in the run game, and he proves to be right once again. \n\"We just both have the mindset, and not just me and him, but everybody on our team, we just want to win. We want to do whatever it takes to win. If it means sacrificing playing time or swallowing egos at times, there's no problem with us, and that's a testament to how we were trained all year round.\" \nLater in the first half, the Buckeyes stuck with Jones after they reached the red zone, and it paid dividends as he tossed a 19-yard touchdown pass to senior wide receiver Braxton Miller, a score that gave the Buckeyes a 21-7 lead over Maryland with 6:41 to play in the second quarter. \nAfter being pulled in favor of Barrett on each of the Buckeyes' previous two trips inside the red zone, Jones ran a fast-paced offense and moved the Buckeyes 61 yards in eight plays, which prompted Meyer to leave him in the game for the next play, and that turned into a touchdown as he fired a pass to the right front corner of the end zone, where Miller jumped to haul in the score. \nOn the previous play, Jones connected with Miller on a 33-yard gain. On second-and-nine from Ohio State's 48-yard line, Jones took the shotgun snap, surveyed the field and found Miller striding past Maryland's secondary down the middle of the field. Jones tossed the ball down the field and Miller dove to catch the ball at full extension for the first down. \nEarlier in the drive, Jones flared a pass out to running back Ezekiel Elliott in the right flat, and the junior ran for a gain of 11 yards before being knocked out of bounds. Just two plays earlier, Elliott ran for a gain of two yards on fourth-and-inches at Ohio State's 29-yard line. \nJones threw one more touchdown, and Barrett added another two scores, as the Buckeyes scored three times at the midway point of the second half. \n\"Timing is definitely a key component to our passing game, and any passing game actually, but yeah, we kind of worked extra hard on getting things that we need to have in our passing game to complement our run game down pat, and it paid off today,\" Jones said. \n\"I think it can work. Coach Meyer does an unbelievable job of managing it. He makes sure both players are prepared in each situation. The plan was to improve our red-zone offense, and how did we do that? We had to add an extra element, a quarterback run, and that he's unbelievable doing. \n\"If it helps us win, I'm down with it.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1RAoF7L TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:12:42.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
