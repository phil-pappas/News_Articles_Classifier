He had another late chance in close, but couldn’t beat Allen. \nSt. Louis opened the scoring at 7:36 of the first when Lehtera buried his second after Miller overplayed a cross-ice pass from Jaden Schwartz. \nComing off back-to-back road victories against the Anaheim Ducks and Los Angeles Kings, the Canucks had a chance to grab the lead earlier in the period, but failed to even get a shot off when they broke in on a 4-on-1 rush. \nNotes: Stastny left in the second period and did not return. … Coming into Friday, the Blues had not beaten the Canucks since April 16, 2013. … Vancouver hosts the Oilers on Sunday in the second game of five-game homestand, while St. Louis visits the Winnipeg Jets. … The Canucks dressed McCann and Jake Virtanen, both 19, marking the first time the team had played two teenagers since Rob Murphy (19) and Trevor Linden (18) suited up on Nov. 13, 1988.
