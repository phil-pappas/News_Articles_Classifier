Not surprisingly, he is hoping that his son lights up the scoreboard:\nThe main thing I want is to see them win. As long as they have one point more than the Colts, I'm fine. That being said, I'd like to see them put 60 points on the board and love to see Tom throw for 500 yards and eight touchdowns. That's me dreaming. That kind of comes from me.\nFirst and foremost, all Brady Sr. cares about is a New England victory. And that result, not the margin of victory, should be the focus for the Patriots. If they are in a position to pour it on, however, they can try to do so during the game.\nNew England has dropped at least 42 points in each of its past four meetings with Indianapolis and has not won by fewer than 20 points in any of those games. Now that the team has a chance to take out nine months of frustration, this game could also have a lopsided score.\nIt will be up to the Colts to contain the nearly unstoppable Patriots offense.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://bleacherreport.com/", "http://bleacherreport.com/indianapolis-colts", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/sunday-morning-qb-brady-dad-run-colts-article-1.2401279", "http://bleacherreport.com/new-england-patriots"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:51:11.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
