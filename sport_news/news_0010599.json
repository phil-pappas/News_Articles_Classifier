An embarrassing loss last year to Paramus sent their 5-0 season on a downslide they never recovered from.\nThe Maroons had revenge as well as redemption on their minds this time around, and it was some good old-fashioned defense that was the theme of the day for Ridgewood, as they knocked off the Spartans, 17-7, on Friday.\nIt was the best victory in two seasons for the Maroons (5-1). It also could end up being the game that gets them into the North 1 Group 5 playoffs.\n\"A quality win, no doubt about it,\" Ridgewood coach Chuck Johnson said. \"It wasn’t pretty, but we fought hard and you have to hand it to our defense.\"\nThat defense was led by the three down lineman. Nose guard Jack Simpson and defensive tackles Ken Ekert and Ted Murphy were the difference when it counted the most.\nMurphy, a junior, had perhaps his best game as a Maroon, recording eight tackles that included key stops that thwarted Paramus drives. Ekert had five tackles, including two for loss, and Simpson had three stops with one for loss.\nTogether, they led the bend-but-don’t-break defense that came up big in big moments. Derek DeLaCruz ran 32 times for 177 yards, but he was virtually the entire offense for Paramus (3-3).\n\"We remembered that 35-0 [loss to Paramus] last year, and we were determined to turn that around,\" Ekert said. \"All three of us knew that a lot depended on how we played and we got it done.\"\nAfter a scoreless first quarter, Ridgewood struck first via the pass, something the Maroons have struggled with all season. Quarterback Griffin Peene threw a perfect strike downfield to Dan Romero and the sophomore receiver outlegged the Spartan defense for a 73-yard touchdown.\nThe Maroons took advantage of a Paramus mistake late in the half to score again. A bad snap on a punt resulted in a 30-yard loss and gave Ridgewood the ball at the Spartan 31. Wylie Sherman kicked a 26-yard field goal with two seconds remaining in the half to make it 10-0.\nThe Maroons put together an 11-play, 79-yard march early in the third quarter, capped by a 5-yard Zack Feagles touchdown for a 17-0 lead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:33:43.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
