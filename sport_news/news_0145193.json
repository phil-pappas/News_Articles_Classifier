Missed playoffs. \nCOACH: Darryl Sutter (fifth season, 16th NHL season). \nADDED: F Milan Lucic, D Christian Ehrhoff, G Jhonas Enroth. \nLOST: D Robyn Regehr, D Slava Voynov, F Justin Williams, F Jarret Stoll, F Mike Richards, D Andrej Sekera, G Martin Jones. \nPLAYER TO WATCH: F Dustin Brown. The Kings love the leadership of the only captain ever to raise the Stanley Cup in their jersey, but they need more production this fall as he begins the second season of an eight-year contract with an annual cap hit of $5.875 million. Brown's career-low 11 goals and inconsistent play were alarming last season, but the physical forward is determined to give Los Angeles more for its money. \nOUTLOOK: The Kings have had five months of rest and rumination after missing the playoffs by two points last spring, failing to give themselves a chance to defend their title. After an offseason dominated by two player arrests, Voynov's ugly saga and a roster shuffle, the Kings are eager to show they still have championship form â€” and not many NHL observers doubt they can contend again. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T16:09:14.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
