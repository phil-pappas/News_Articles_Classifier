We can get back on track. \n\"We'll be better on Tuesday.\" \nHughes had signalled before the Watford contest that Potters captain Ryan Shawcross - yet to feature for the first team this season after summer back surgery - would be likely to make his return to action against Chelsea. \nAnd he has admitted the poor efforts of some of his players on Saturday has made him contemplate making various changes for Tuesday. \n\"Ryan was in my thoughts for Tuesday anyway,\" Hughes said. \n\"But obviously, given some of the performances against Watford, maybe other players come into my thinking as well.\" \nWhile critical of his own side's exploits in Saturday's match, Hughes was also keen to praise Quique Sanchez Flores' energetic, well-organised Watford outfit. \n\"They are disciplined, athletic at the back and can get around the pitch,\" said Hughes, whose team have now won only one of five home games this season. \n\"We didn't have enough on the field to really affect that. \n\"It doesn't happen very often here and I don't anticipate it will in the future.\" \nWatford have made a very creditable start to life back in the top flight following their promotion last season, with the win at Stoke giving them 13 points - one more than their hosts - from 10 games. \nFlores said: \"I am very happy. \n\"This is the first quarter and the moment to make a report maybe. The amount of points is okay - I think to have 13 points is very nice for Watford. \n\"But the most important thing is the way in which we got these points. \n\"We feel competitive, which is very important for the future.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T15:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:20:32.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
