It will be the first time the Red Devils (4-4) and Bulldogs (3-5) have met in a sectional contest since 2012, when Jeff defeated New Albany in the first round of Class 5A Sectional 8, 62-35. \nIt will be the ninth time the Hoosier Hills Conference foes have battled in the postseason. The Red Devils have won five of the eight previous postseason meetings. \nThe Jeff-New Albany matchup is one of three conference rematches involving area squads. \nFloyd Central (4-4) will host HHC foe Bedford North Lawrence (4-4) in the Class 5A Sectional 16 semifinals Friday, Oct. 30 at Weigleb Stadium. Clarksville (0-8) will entertain Mid-Southern Conference rival Eastern (2-6) on Oct. 23 in the opening round of Class 2A Sectional 40. \nPossibly the most enticing first-round matchup involving area teams will be in Class 3A Sectional 31, which is one of the toughest sectionals in Southern Indiana. Charlestown (6-2) will host Class 3A No. 5 Heritage Hills (7-1) on Oct. 23 at Dutch Reis Field. \nCLASS 6A SECTIONAL 8 \nThe winner of the Red Devil-Bulldog semifinal will travel to the winner of the sectional’s other semi, which pits Class 6A No. 1 and two-time defending sectional champion Center Grove (8-0) against No. 8 Columbus North (6-2). \nJeff head coach Alfonzo Browning definitely thinks the draw is a favorable one for his squad with two ranked teams butting heads in the other semifinal. \n“It’s probably the best draw we can get with us not having to face North or Center Grove in the opening game. It gives us a chance to compete,” Browning said. “I think we’re competing pretty good. I think we’re getting better and growing at the right time.” \nThe IHSAA’s blind draw was a new experience for first-year New Albany head coach Sean Coultis. The Bulldog boss previously coached in Illinois, where teams must have at least a winning record to qualify for the postseason and the playoffs have a seeding system. \n“This is new to me. It’s kind of interesting. In Illinois, a 5-4 record did not guarantee you a spot in the playoffs,” Coultis said. “It’s exciting to play a rival [in the sectional] and get the game at home. It’s been an up-and-down season. We’ve got good kids who work hard and come ready to work every day.” \nJeff defeated the Bulldogs in the regular-season meeting Oct. 2 at Buerk Field, 25-12. New Albany leads the all-time series, 49-37-5. \nCLASS 5A SECTIONAL 16 \nThe Highlanders lost to Bedford on Oct. 2 at Weigleb Stadium, 28-21. In that game, Floyd Central held a 14-7 lead with 5:17 remaining in the third quarter. But the Stars outscored the Highlanders 21-7 the rest of the way to get the come-from-behind win. Floyd lost three fumbles in the game, as it rained for most of the night. \nThe winner between the Highlanders and Bedford will face either Castle (4-4) or Evansville North (1-7) on Friday, Nov. 6 in the sectional final. The Knights will host the Huskies in the other Oct. 30 semifinal. \n“It’s good that we don’t have to travel to Evansville, and it’s always good that you get a second chance at playing someone that beat you earlier in the year,” Floyd Central head coach Brian Glesing said. “It’s obviously anybody’s sectional. I’d say Castle is probably the favorite, but I think it’s wide open. We’re happy to get a second chance at Bedford.” \nFloyd Central is in a new sectional this season after playing in Class 5A Sectional 14 the past two years. The Highlanders lost the Sectional 14 title game at Whiteland in both of those seasons. \nCLASS 4A SECTIONAL 23 \nSilver Creek (4-4) will begin play in its new sectional Oct. 23 when it travels to Madison (0-8) in the opening round. First-year Dragons’ head coach John Dablow thinks the Cubs’ winless record is deceptive and plans on warning his players about that prior to the first-round contest. \n“I don’t think their record is indicative of how their team has played. They always play a tough schedule,” Dablow said. “Our sectional is pretty spread out [as far as location], so to go to Madison is good for us.” \nThe other first-round game in Silver Creek’s half of its bracket will have Franklin County (5-3) traveling to Seymour (2-6). \nThe two opening-round contests in the bracket’s lower half are Class 4A No. 5 East Central (7-1) at South Dearborn (3-5) and Class 4A No. 9 Shelbyville (7-1) at Jennings County (6-2). \nDablow says the Dragons are currently working on trying to put a complete game together. In Silver Creek’s last two losses to North Harrison (32-12) and Brownstown Central (38-13), Dablow says his troops played only one good half in each contest. \n“We’re coming off our two toughest games of the year against North Harrison and Brownstown, and we probably played half of a game against both of them,” Dablow said. “If we can get to the point where we can put two good halves together, we can be a tough team to beat.” \nCLASS 3A SECTIONAL 31 \nIf defending sectional champion Charlestown beats Heritage Hills, it will face the winner between Salem (3-5) and Brownstown (6-2) in the semifinals. If the Pirates and Braves do meet, the semifinal will be at Charlestown on Oct. 30. \nThe other two opening-round games are Corydon Central (5-3) at Brown County (1-7) and Class 3A No. 8 and MSC champion North Harrison (8-0) at Southridge (6-2). \n“We have a tough draw. We’re going to have to beat three good teams to win it. If we do that, then we’ll definitely deserve it. We’ll be ready,” Pirates’ head coach Jason Hawkins said. “You have six or seven teams that can probably win it.” \nCharlestown has been on a roll as of late. The Pirates have won four games in a row since their 27-18 loss at North Harrison on Sept. 11. \n“We’ve gotten better overall. I think we’ll be a tough out [in the sectional],” Hawkins said. \nCLASS 2A SECTIONAL 40 \nProvidence (2-6) will host Crawford County (1-7) in the first round Oct. 23. The winner will face the victor between South Spencer (2-6) and Class 2A No. 1 and defending 2A state runner-up Evansville Mater Dei (8-0). If both the Pioneers and Mater Dei win, they will face each other at Providence in the semifinals Oct. 30. \n“We’re glad to get to play at home,” Providence head coach Larry Denison said about the opening-round matchup with the Wolfpack. “Obviously, Mater Dei is going to be the team to beat. We’re excited to possibly play two games at home. But we’ve got to get past Crawford County first.” \nThe Clarksville-Eastern winner will play either North Posey (2-6) or Forest Park (4-4) in the Oct. 30 semis. The Generals lost at home to the Musketeers on Aug. 28, 28-7. \n“It’s a good draw. We’re looking forward to playing them again. The last time we played them, we missed some tackles and made some mistakes,” Clarksville head coach Steve Cooley said. “We’ve gotten better in a lot of areas. We’re still young, but we’ve got to start making plays and growing up.” \nSECTIONAL PAIRINGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T06:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:08:09.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
