Polar A360 features industry-leading heart rate measurement-based training guidance, in addition to 24/7 activity tracking, and all this information is displayed on a high-resolution color touchscreen. The A360 is waterproof and tracks daily activity, steps, calories, workouts, and sleep.\nDesigned to encompass a 360-degree lifestyle and encourage activity, Polar A360 vibrates to inform users of incoming calls, messages, calendar alerts, and social media notifications, and also to provide gentle reminders when they have been sitting still for too long. The Polar A360 is not only stylish, but also comfortable with small, medium, and large sizes available for the perfect fit. Users can match their personal style with interchangeable and vibrantly colored, soft silicone wristbands, which will be available in Powder White, Charcoal Black, Neon Green, Sorbet Pink and Navy Blue for individual purchase. Fully charged, the Polar A360 will track for two weeks with 24/7 activity tracking, including one hour of training per day. It also works with Polar's H7 heart rate monitor in case users prefer to train with a chest strap. The Polar A360 will be available in November 2015 for $274,99 .\n\"The key to achieving Polar's well-known accuracy relies on how data is recorded by the sensor, and then how it is interpreted. We developed our own algorithm for optical heart rate monitoring and optimized the hardware design to ensure the A360 meets the same accuracy and quality standards that Polar customers have come to expect,\" says Marco Suvilaakso , Global Product Director at Polar. \"Polar created the first heart rate monitor, and 38 years later we continue to be the trusted industry standard.\"\nThe latest wearable from Polar goes beyond daily activity tracking to also provide personalized training guidance and motivation to help users meet their fitness goals. The A360 offers the company's unique Smart Coaching features such as Activity Guide and Activity Benefit , which provide practical daily activity target suggestions and explain how activities affect the user's health.\nDaily activity and heart rate training details can be viewed on the Polar Flow mobile app (available for iOS and Android), which offers an in-depth analysis of daily, weekly, and monthly activity. The Polar Flow web service also offers a window into a person's fitness and training diary. If training with a coach or personal trainer, Polar Flow for Coach offers additional training support, as users can connect and share workout information via the web service and receive feedback from their coaches. The A360 also works with Polar Club , allowing users to train with club instructors and view live heart rate data during fitness classes.\nThe Polar A360 will be available in Charcoal Black (size: M, L) and Powder White (size: S) in November in retail stores and online globally for $274,99 . Additional colors such as Sorbet Pink (S, M) and Navy Blue (M) will be available soon after launch. Changeable wristbands in Powder White, Charcoal Black, Sorbet Pink, Navy Blue and Neon Green will be available in a variety of sizes and sold separately early next year.\nAbout Polar\nFounded in 1977, Polar Electro invented the world's first wireless heart rate monitor.
