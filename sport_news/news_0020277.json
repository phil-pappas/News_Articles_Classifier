He played five minutes in Saturday's road victory over the Houston Rockets in his preseason debut, converting his only shot, a 3-pointer. He then played nine minutes in Sunday's road victory over the Atlanta Hawks, again converting his lone shot, also a 3-point attempt. He also had two rebounds and an assist in that appearance.\nWinderman on Heat at three-quarter pole of preseason Ira Winderman on issues Heat must resolve with just over a week before the start of the regular season.\nIra Winderman on issues Heat must resolve with just over a week before the start of the regular season.\nSee more videos The moves leave the Heat with the NBA-maximum 20 players in training camp. In addition to Hawkins and Weber likely reporting to Sioux Falls, the Heat also are positioned to have current roster longshots Greg Whittington and Keith Benson also assigned to their D-League affiliate.\nThe Heat have two remaining preseason games before opening their regular season on Oct. 28 at AmericanAirlines Arena against the Charlotte Hornets.\nNBA teams must trim to a maximum of 15 players on Oct. 26, with the Heat's final cuts expected by Saturday, in advance of the 48-hour waiver period.\nWeber played four seasons at Virginia Commonwealth, appearing in 127 games and averaged 6.8 points, 3.3 rebounds, 3.0 assists, 2.94 steals and 23.4 minutes while shooting .426 from the field. He finished as VCU's all-time career steals leader, finishing third on the NCAA all-time steals list. He became the first player in conference history to be named the Atlantic 10 Defensive Player of the Year in three consecutive seasons.\nPreview: Washington Wizards at Miami Heat, 8 p.m. Wednesday Ira Winderman When/Where: 8 p.m., AmericanAirlines Arena.\nTickets: Available at HEAT.com or 1-800-4NBA-TIX.\nTV: ESPN.
