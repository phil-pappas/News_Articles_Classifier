Eden Gardens curator Mukherjee, who was squarely blamed for the episode abandonment of yesterday's third and final Twenty20 match between India and South Africa, was adamant not to show his face again, while the CAB today softened its stance on the octogenarian.\nCAB treasurer Biswarup Dey, who had demanded the curator's resignation last night, today said he would speak to the curator personally, apparently to convince him to return to his job.\n\"Such things happen in everyone's life. Sometimes even a top class doctor fails to get a patient healed. He is such an experienced person and we must show some respect to him. I will speak to him personally. It was a learning experience for us,\" Dey said. Asked whether the Eden is in danger of losing the World Twenty20 final, Dey quipped: \"If unlawful activities rise in New Delhi then will the capital be shifted?\" Ground committee chairman Debabrata Das, however, blamed curator Mukhejee for the failure to host the match yesterday.\nClaiming that the veteran curator did not listen to Ganguly, he said: \"Ganguly called him thrice requesting him to cover the ground way ahead of the the rainfall but he did not pay any heed.\n\"'I know the ground better than anyone else', Prabirda told us.\"\nThe third and final T20I between India and South Africa yesterday was abandoned without a ball being bowled because of wet outfield due to passing showers in the afternoon. It also exposed the iconic venue's poor drainage system and also potrayed CAB in a poor light as the match could not be held more than seven hours after the rain subsided.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:45:15.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
