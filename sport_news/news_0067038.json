Photograph by: Courtesy , Michael Bye \nWhen horses enter the starting gate on Sunday for the ninth and final race of the afternoon at Hastings Racecourse, it will bring down the curtain on a 2015 thoroughbred season that proved to be successful in many ways. \nAmong the highlights that helped make things memorable this past summer was the move by the local racing industry to attract new customers with the formation of the Hastings Racing Club. A group of 200 people invested a one-time fee of $250 to become horse owners under the guidance of Richard Yates, who agreed to act as general manager of the club. \nWhile the racing industry paid for the purchase of three horses, the membership fees covered stabling, veterinarian and blacksmith costs, plus training and other expenses. \nThe star of the Hastings Racing Club stable became Square Dancer, purchased for a reported $30,000 by trainer Steve Henson after he had watched the three-year-old run in Arizona and Washington. \nSince arriving at Hastings, Square Dancer became a Cinderella story winning three races from four starts, including the $50,000 SW Randall Plate and $100,000 Redekop Classic. His only loss came in dramatic fashion when he finished second by a nose in the $100,000 BC Premiers. \n“All of the owners were more than satisfied with the way things worked out,” Yates says. “In fact, I believe they would have been happy no matter how much Square Dancer won. They were just thrilled to be part of it.” \nYates officially dissolves the club as of Oct. 31 with the remaining funds on hand being returned to the membership on a per-share basis. \n“A second stable has already been formed for 2016,” Yates reports. “We already have 160 new members and, of course, the original owners have first call on joining again. The plan was to introduce new people to our sport and it worked splendidly.” \nPICK SIX CARRYOVER: Another hit at Hastings Racecourse this year developed with the newly introduced Sea to Sky Pick 6 that wound up with a carryover of $425,000 before a mandatory payout on Oct. 18. Catching the attention of wagering in the U.S., the carryover paid 37 winners $10,774.18 on a 20-cent ticket. “It was definitely exciting to see our product so well received in other racing markets,” said Hastings Racecourse General Manager Darren MacDonald. “We believe it was the highest carryover in Canada in recent years.” \nTOP FILLY: Certainly another highlight was local fans getting the opportunity to watch Academic win the BC Derby after coming off victories in the Woodbine Oaks in Toronto, and Canadian Derby in Edmonton. Insiders think Academic will be named Top Canadian Filly in Canada this year. \nSUNSHINE: Unlike past years where Mother Nature had not been to kind to racing, this season horses and jockeys raced on sloppy or wet surfaces only five times. \nNOTES ON A PROGRAM: Local owners Swift Thoroughbreds Inc. have purchased a major interest in Irish-bred Last Waltz, expected to race in the $2-million Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Fillies at Keeneland next weekend…Hastings’ trainer Craig MacPherson will be in Keeneland overseeing local owner Chad Joe’s Bluegrass Angus on the Breeders’ Cup undercard… \nThe final two days of this year’s Hastings calendar go Saturday and Sunday at 1:50 p.m. There’s plenty of standardbred action at Fraser Downs with one of the season’s biggest events - Breeders Classic Day – scheduled for Nov. 11. © Special feature E-mail this Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:00:31.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
