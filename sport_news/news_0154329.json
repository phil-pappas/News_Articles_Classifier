Go big, go home: On Monday, the best way to slow Memphis' offense is to limit big plays. For Memphis, the best way to beat USF is to run up the score and turn this into a shootout. That means big plays, an early lead and a mediocre Bulls offense trying to play catch-up in the second half. If that happens, Memphis will win and return home for a week off with an unbeaten record â€” and a full 14 days to prepare for Ole Miss.\n2. The (Mack) stops here: USF running back and reigning AAC rookie of the year Marlon Mack racked up 159 yards against Memphis last season, including a 75-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. It was one of just allowed by the defense all year. This season, the Tigers have proved more susceptible to big plays, and ripping off another one.\n3. Business trip: On paper, this has all the ingredients of a trap game for Memphis. It's an opponent the Tigers should definitely beat, sandwiched between two of the most important games of their season. It will be tempting for players to dwell on the Cincinnati game, or look past USF and start dreaming about an SEC upset on Oct. 17.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:33:32.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
