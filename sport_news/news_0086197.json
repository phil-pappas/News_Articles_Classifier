The quarterback has always had a good memory and has always used negativity as motivation. This offseason, he received a lot of motivation. Following seven months of Deflategate talk where Brady was beaten down by the national media, the quarterback has been a little different this season. Once again on Sunday, he refused to talk to the national broadcast (NBC) and once again, his post-game press conference was very short. In the past, it’s been around 10 minutes or so and this season, it’s been under five minutes. On his weekly WEEI appearance, Brady was asked if he was sticking it to the media this season. \"There are a lot of requests and demands for my time and I think since winning the last Super Bowl, a lot of different things have kind of happened with my life, just in general,\" Brady said. “I just think having a concerted effort to save as much energy as I can, when I can, where I can, and to give my teammates opportunities to do some of the real cool things that I've had a chance to do over the course of my career. “I've kind of done a lot of things over the course of my life. I get asked to do a lot of things. Some things fit into what my routine may be, and other things maybe don't, and I think it's great for my teammates to have opportunities to do some of those things they always ask me to do. In a lot of ways, I feel like a lot of those guys should get a lot of attention also.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:03:44.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
