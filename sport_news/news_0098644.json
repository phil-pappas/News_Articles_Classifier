An up-and-coming head coach that could tip a few back. The one who supposedly visited campus bars. The guy who once expensed 45 shots of Patron Tequila to the UW athletic department.\nBut they stayed rumors. A subject of constant gossip from the assorted media that covered Washington football, Steve Sarkisian's erratic off-field behavior never made it into any mainstream publication, was mentioned sparingly on social media (surprisingly) and was rendered an afterthought when Sarkisian bolted UW and accepted his dream job at USC in December 2013.\nNow he has been put on a leave of absence there.\nSark's antics were great bar fodder, but not much else.\nThen Sarkisian showed up to USC's Salute to Troy banquet in late August visibly intoxicated, slurring his words and cursing in front of a throng of the school's boosters. Instead of being suspended, he continued coaching with the blessing of USC athletic director Pat Haden. Sarkisian followed with a public apology shortly afterward, saying he mixed his medication with a small amount of alcohol.\nOn April 20, Sarkisian's wife, Stephanie, filed for divorce.\nAny college football fan with the slightest connection to a smart phone, computer, iPad, the outside world knows that Sarkisian was granted an indefinite leave of absence after he allegedly showed up at a special teams meeting drunk on Sunday morning.\nScott Wolf, the USC beat writer for the Los Angeles Daily News, detailed Sarkisian's erratic behavior with the help anonymous sources , revealing a coach that has repeatedly been seen intoxicated in front of his team since taking over last season.\nBREAKING: #USC players said Sarkisian drank and passed out on flight back from Washington State game in 2014. Some reportedly took photos\n— InsideUSC (@InsideUSC) October 11, 2015 A witness tells me Patron Tequila was also Sarkisian drink of choice in locker room following #USC Holiday Bowl victory over Nebraska\n— InsideUSC (@InsideUSC) October 11, 2015 The latest episode came on the heels of Sarkisian's most devastating loss as USC coach -- a 17-12 defeat to Washington last week at the L.A. Coliseum in his first game against UW since leaving Seattle. It dropped USC out of the polls after the Trojans were chosen preseason to win the Pac-12.\nHaden met with reporters Sunday but declined to take questions after he reportedly didn't allow Sarkisian, 41, to attend practice.\n\"I was at a basketball event earlier today when I got a call to say Sarkisian was not at practice,\" Haden told reporters. \"I called Steve and he made it clear to me that he was not healthy, and I asked him to take an indefinite leave of absence. I think this is the right thing for our team.\n\"I've spoken to our team and our coaches — they obviously had a great deal of concern for the health of Coach Sarkisian. It was also clear to me the support that Clay has from the team, and the staff. We've got a big task this week with the Notre Dame game, and Clay will do a great job getting our team ready. I don't have a lot of answers right now for you guys, as I first heard about this an hour and a half ago.\"\nOffensive coordinator Clay Helton was named interim head coach in place of Sarkisian, who was also allegedly drunk during USC's 42-14 win Sept. 26 over Arizona State.\nSarkisian went 9-4 last season in his first season as USC coach, highlighted by a Holiday Bowl win over Nebraska. At UW, he went 34-29 (24-21 conference) in almost five seasons before departing days after UW's win in the 2013 Apple Cup.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:01:35.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
