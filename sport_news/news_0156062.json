Posted: Thursday, October 1, 2015 7:21 pm \nEdmond North enjoyed a big Tuesday night. \nRick Nordyke, too. \nThe Huskies softball coach registered career-win No. 500, with North taking down crosstown rival Edmond Santa Fe, 6-3 at Edmond North High School. \nThe win pushed Nordyke to the milestone and made the Huskies the 2015 city champs, since Edmond North went 4-0 in Edlam clashes, including three wins over Memorial. \nIn Tuesday’s game, senior first baseman Julia Minter shined in her final home game, going 3-for-4 with a double and three runs batted in. Shortstop Kennedy Thomas went 2-for-4 and drove in two for the Huskies, while third baseman Amy Crabaugh added two hits and an RBI. \nNorth scored twice in the first and added two more runs in the fourth to push its lead to 4-1 before the Wolves made it interesting with two unearned runs in the sixth. \nBut the Huskies extended the lead again in their half of the sixth, with Minter and Thomas each driving in runs. \nJillian Helsley started in the circle and went 5 2/3 innings, allowing four hits and one earned run while striking out three. Thomas finished with 1 1/3 innings of scoreless relief for the save. \nAfterward, Nordyke, who won 463 games as Huskies baseball coach, was presented with a plaque and many tributes from former players and coaches were read. The night also featured a celebration of Edmond North’s two state championship teams from 2004 and 2012. Many players and coaches from both squads were on hand and the 2015 girls wore the 2004 uniforms, which included shorts. \nThe Huskies close the regular season with two games this weekend at the OC shootout — Friday against Norman North and Saturday against Stillwater — then a trip to Deer Creek on Monday.
