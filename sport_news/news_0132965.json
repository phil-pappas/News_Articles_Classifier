Bear Creek sophomore Justin Alexander and senior Sarah Seybold saw more birthday cake smeared on teammate’s faces than was eaten following the racing on an overcast day that saw both runners post personal bests in their 5K races. Alexander led the Bruins to 15-50 wins against Edison and Chavez with a 16:06 that set a school record for a 5K and a new Oak Grove course mark by a Bruin since 2008, when Alex Calderon posted a 16:11. Seybold led the Bruins’ girls squad to wins by an 18-45 margin over Edison and a 15-50 score against Chavez with a 20:36 mark in the 5K that moved her into third place all-time in Bear Creek’s annals. The Titans’ boys team edged the Vikings 21-37 in their dual score, while Edison defeated Chavez 15-50 in the varsity girls competition. Alexander, 15, was followed by Bear Creek’s Adam Brooks (16:40), Terrance Smith (16:57), Rudy Bambico (17:28) and Genesis Campos (17:39), as they swept the first five places. “It was like 105-degree weather the last time I ran here that I had to go home and take an ice bath,” said Alexander, who recently posted an impressive win at the Lowell Invitational against more than 150 sophomores at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. “My teammates are always pushing me and helping build my self confidence.” Seybold, 17, finished ahead of Bruins sophomore Lisa Akai in second (21:33), Edison sophomore Jasmine Munoz in third (22:14), and Bear Creek sophomore Jillian Misa (22:29) and freshman Natalia Gevara (22:52) in fourth and fifth. “I come out every race and just do my best,” said Seybold, who won the Pacific Invitational this season. “I’m really passionate about everything I do, and I give my best every time and (my teammates) all do, too. It’s a great team. It’s like a family. Everyone supports each other. It was definitely a little birthday present to have the sun blocked by clouds today.” Said Bruins varsity girls coach Lauren Fromm, “Sarah is our team leader and she works hard. The younger girls look up to her. Our top seven squad was a little thin, so we are filling it out a little with some of our younger girls who are really stepping up. “Oak Grove is a flat course, so a lot of students (set) (personal records). It’s not their favorite course, but it’s a fast course. It was a little birthday present for everybody that (Seybold and Alexander) both (set personal records) on their birthdays.” Edison’s boys were led by Noe Negrete (20:45) and Victor Garcia (20:45), and the Vikings girls were paced by Munoz and teammates Alicia Amial (23:55) in ninth overall and Yajaira Lorenza (4:06) in 10th. Chavez had Gabriel Gonzalez (18:41) in 10th overall in the varsity boys race, followed by teammates Christian Rosas (19:29) and Andy Yan (20:50), and Brianna Ramirez was fastest for the Titans’ girls (24:24), along with Jessica Rojales (24:59).
