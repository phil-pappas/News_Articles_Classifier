The senior carried the ball 43 times for an unofficial 348 yards and five touchdowns as the Blue Devils pulled away for a 39-13 victory in a Section 4 Class D quarterfinal at Brewer Memorial Stadium. \nLyon also had an interception to snuff a Crusaders drive at the end of the first half in a brilliant encore to last weekâ€™s school-record 347-yard rushing effort against Spencer-Van Etten. He has rushed for nearly 1,800 yards this season. \nLyon gave the Blue Devils (5-3) the lead for good, 19-13, when he ran in from 14 yards out with 1 minute, 15 seconds remaining in the first half. He also had touchdown runs of 3, 10, 14 and 70 yards. \nMoravia earned a semifinal berth against Deposit/Hancock on Oct. 31 at Binghamton Alumni Stadium as part of a Class D doubleheader. Deposit/Hancock was a 66-12 quarterfinal winner over Groton on Friday. \nNotre Dame finished the season with a 5-3 record.
