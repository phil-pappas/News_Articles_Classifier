The possibility of hosting fights at larger venues like the Denny Sanford PREMEIR Center could mean bigger money for local professional fighters. \nSioux Falls resident Stephanie Eggink is getting in a workout tonight. Anytime you see her outside of work, you can expect to see a punching bag nearby. \n\"Sure we have jobs. I'm a paramedic but anytime I'm not working I'm training so it definitely takes up your whole life,\" Eggink said. \nEggink is an accomplished professional MMA fighter . She's one of the few females from the area who steps inside the cage. Eggink believes the sport is growing in KELOLAND, thanks to fights like the RFA Event last year. \n\"I think it shows that the athletes are professional. They're not just a bunch of brawlers. Everyone was respectful and I think that did big things and that's why this ban has been lifted and you're going to see bigger promotions coming to the area,\" Eggink said. \nThat could also mean bigger exposure for fighters like Eggink. \n\"We got such great talent here,\" Bruce Hoyer said. \nBruce Hoyer works with around 120 people at Next Edge Academy. But it's a local fanbase that really helps professional fighters get booked for events. \n\"The problem we have right now is that for us to get a pro fighter on another card, let's say in Fargo or Minneapolis, they need to have an established fan base and the promoter in Fargo or Minneapolis doesn't want to put them on because they don't sell very many tickets because nobody knows who they are,\" Hoyer said. \nWith a venue like the Denny Sanford PREMIER Center, Hoyer thinks local promoters will be able to put together a good professional card. \nAnd offer up more competitors for Eggink. \n\"People don't really understand what MMA is and when they go and watch these events they get excited and people want to partake and train,\" Eggink said.
