When it's screwed up from here on you can blame me, and you can imagine I won't be gentle as I install my own deal.\"\nThe first block Saturday came as Lafayette tried to extend its early lead to 10-0. Instead, Fordham returned the blocked kick to the Lafayette 5 and scored a touchdown of its own to tie the game.\nThe second one came at the end of the first half when the Leopards tried to get some momentum and snap Fordham's 21-point run.\nThe kicks were 35 and 34 yards, respectively, both easily in range for Bissell, who hit three of 40 yards and more against Delaware in a losing effort.\n\"Everybody has an inside responsibility first,\" Tavani said, absolving Bissell, snapper Michael Shiffert and holder Blake Searfoss of any blame. Both blocks against Fordham were the result of someone shirking his responsibility. Bissell is 3-for-4 in 2015 when he's able to get one off cleanly.\nWith six weeks still remaining in the season, Lafayette is already in must-win mode as a result of its Patriot League thumping Saturday night at the hands of reigning champ and 2015 favorite Fordham.\nBut Tavani said, \"I don't even look at it that way. People are talking about a winning season; I'm just trying to win one game: Georgetown, the second one-sixth of our league schedule. That other stuff is for others to write or talk about. The overall record doesn't mean anything to me.\"\nWith that in mind, here's a short to-do list for the Leopards as they prepare to meet Georgetown, which may not be giving merit-based scholarships as the rest of the league schools do, but which has been a major headache for Lafayette in recent years.\nUNPACK THE SACK: Quarterback Drew Reed has been sacked eight times in two games, and for the second straight week, Tavani had issues with the junior's decision-making.\n\"It's something I talked to him about [after the Wagner game], but he has to throw the ball away, even down here in the end zone,\"\nThe incident Tavani mentioned was on a third down at the Fordham 6. It wouldn't have changed the outcome of the game, but it would have shown Tavani that Reed was getting it. Two other sacks were on one series — one on a first down. \"Those are mental errors,\" Tavani said.\nTHIRD-DOWN OPTIONS: Lafayette was 3-for-14 on third-down plays Saturday night, and seven of the eight Reed third-down passes were intended for wide receiver Matt Mrazek. Four were incomplete; one was intercepted. Tavani said formation and coverage dictates some of that, but more options might be another answer. The one pass that went to a different receiver was a 37-yard strike to Rocco Palumbo.\nELIMINATE LONG TDS: Lafayette opponents have run only 11 more offensive plays than the Leopards in five games but have a whopping 672-yard advantage in total offense. The 20-and-over touchdown plays for Leopards' opponents are: William & Mary: 58- and 52-yard passes and a 32-yard run; Princeton: 23- and 26-yard runs; Wagner: 51-yard pass; Fordham: 67-yard run and 71-yard pass. Only Delaware didn't break a big one.\nRetired sports columnist Paul Reinhard is a freelance writer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:56:02.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
