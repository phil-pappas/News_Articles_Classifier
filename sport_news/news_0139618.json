And once you lose at this stage, you are out of the competition,” he said. \nHe expressed hope that the team will not disappoint as they prepare for the knockout stage. \n“I wish them well. And I hope they do us proud because for them to have qualified with a game to spare, it shows they are a good side.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T15:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:04:06.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
