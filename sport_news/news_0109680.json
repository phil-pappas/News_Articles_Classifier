Dickey's fourth pitch of the game, Alex Rios connected an inning later and the Kansas City Royals routed the Toronto Blue Jays 14-2 Tuesday to move one win from a second straight World Series. Kansas City moved ahead 3-1 in the best-of-seven AL Championship Series and can win the pennant Wednesday, when Edinson Volquez starts against Toronto's Marco Estrada in a Game 1 rematch. Lorenzo Cain scored on a passed ball and Mike Moustakas had a sacrifice fly in an LCS-record four-run top of the first. Kansas led 5-2 in the seventh before breaking away. Blue Jays infielder Cliff Pennington relieved in the ninth inning, becoming the first primarily position player to pitch in the postseason, STATS said.
