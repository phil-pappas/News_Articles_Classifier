Wilson admired Ward’s ability to be in the right place at the right time in the most crucial moments. He watched Ward play on the first line beside Alex Ovechkin and Nicklas Backstrom, and he tried to incorporate some of the things Ward did into his own game. \n“Now, he’s the enemy,” Wilson said. \nWard returns to the Verizon Center on Tuesday night , but as a member of the San Jose Sharks. He and the Capitals may exchange hugs after the game, but he’ll be just like any other member of the opposition as soon as the puck drops. \nThough he’s not on the team anymore, his name is still commonly mentioned, even when the Sharks aren’t in town. Coach Barry Trotz has repeatedly said he sees some of Ward in forward Sean Collins and Wilson hasn’t been shy about the impact Ward had on him. \n“Being compared to a player like that is a great compliment,” Collins said. “Hopefully, I can live up to the comparisons. … He protects the puck well and is kind of a guy that can be used in a lot of different situations. Just one of those guys the coaching staff really trusts, so I’m trying to gain the trust of the coaching staff.” \nSaid Wilson: “He was a pure goal scorer, one of the best I’ve seen at finding the right areas. I definitely took a page out of his textbook. For a guy that was kind of running down like me, it was good to watch him and kind of take stuff from his game that I could put into mine and make my game a little more well-rounded.” \nWard had 34 points for the Capitals in 2014-15, logging his second straight 82-game season and playing the 500th game of his career. He also had nine points in 14 postseason games, which led Washington during its run into the Eastern Conference semifinals. \nWhat struck Wilson most about Ward was how he took his time coming into the offensive zone, often letting plays develop rather than frenetically skating around. Wilson tried to emulate that sort of patience, and it showed in the Capitals’ season opener. He held onto the puck just long enough to draw four New Jersey Devils to him before feeding Brooks Orpik, who fired for a goal. \n“I’m playing with [Jason Chimera] now, and he played with Chimmer a lot,” Wilson said. “Chimmer kind of tells me sometimes, ‘Hey, this is what Wardo would do, and that’s why we had so much success, so maybe just stay in that spot.’ \n“We definitely miss him around here and he was an awesome dude. We’re going to have a friendship for a long time, I think. I’ll see him around in the summers. But during the season, we’re not the best of friends anymore.” \nWill Wilson hit Ward in Tuesday night’s game? \n“I’ll probably give him a bump,” Wilson said. “We’ll see.” Isabelle Khurshudyan covers the Washington Capitals.
