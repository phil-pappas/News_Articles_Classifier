Two days after knocking off the rival Rangers in overtime, the Devils picked up their second straight win when defenseman Adam Larsson scored 43 seconds into the extra session to give New Jersey a 3-2 victory over the Arizona Coyotes on Tuesday night. Travis Zajac had a goal and two assists, with the second one setting up Larsson's slam dunk into an open net. The goal capped a 3-on-1 break that started after the defenseman knocked Martin Hanzal off the puck in the Devils' zone. \"I got a perfect, perfect pass by Travis there,\" Larsson said. \"I was just standing far post.\" It was a chance the Devils almost squandered. Larsson skated the puck into the Coyotes zone and sent a pass to Lee Stempniak, who scored the OT game winner Sunday. The pass eluded him, got by an Arizona defender and went right to Zajac. \"I saw the D man and then I made a terrible pass, but I was lucky it didn't bounce over his stick,\" Larsson said. \"It would be a 3-on-0 the other way, but, in the end, Trav made a real good pass to me.\" Mike Cammalleri also scored for New Jersey and Cory Schneider made 18 saves for the Devils (2-3-1), who have earned five points in their last three games. \"One of the things we didn't have in the first few games was elevated performances by real important guys on our team, guys who are the leaders,\" Devils coach John Hynes said. \"The last three games we have had that.\" Anthony Duclair and Mikkel Boedker scored for Arizona, which has lost three in a row. Mike Smith made 22 saves in the opener of a five-game East Coast road trip for Arizona.
