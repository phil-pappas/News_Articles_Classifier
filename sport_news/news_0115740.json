(AP) — Hornets guard Jeremy Lamb has left Monday night’s game against the Chicago Bulls with a sprained right ankle. \nLamb’s return is doubtful, according to the team. \nLamb appeared to step on someone’s foot along the baseline and came up limping. He played four minutes and did not have any points. \nThe Hornets are hoping to get through the preseason without any more injuries. They’ve already lost starting small forward Michael Kidd-Gilchrist for six months to a shoulder injury. \nEarlier in the game, Charlotte had a scare when point guard Kemba Walker tumbled to the court after a drive to the basket. He remained on the floor for several minutes, was taken to the locker room but was diagnosed with left heel contusion. He did return to the game.
