The incident happened yesterday evening.\n\"It is a tragedy and it's so close to home. I mean, it's just right there,\" says Davis.\nDavis lives across the road from where 12-year-old Teresa Potts lived with a 13-year-old boy.\n\"I'm pretty sure he did have some anger issues. There have been some incidents before where they have had cop cars over there. Obviously, they don't come over here and tell us what's going on. But we have heard that stuff. I think some of the teachers at the school have noticed that, as well,\" says Davis.\nJasper County Sheriff Randee Kaiser says the boy intentionally shot Potts in the front yard of the children's home. Kaiser says the victim's father called 911, and when deputies arrived, the father was doing CPR on Potts.\nBut the effort wasn't enough, and Potts was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\"Deputies are professionals, they know that they have a job to do. And their feelings or their sadness about working a case like this has to be put on the back burner, because they have a job to do. They see the worst that the world has to present,\" says Kaiser.\nShortly before deputies arrived on scene, the 13-year-old boy fled into nearby woods. Kaiser says deputies later found the boy, and the gun police say was used in the crime was also later found at a different location. The sheriff won't say how the boy got the gun.\nKaiser says there were other weapons at the home that were missing when deputies arrived. Those weapons, which police say were not used in the crime, were also later found. Kaiser says it doesn't appear the mom and dad were negligent with the firearms.\n\"I'm not going to comment on any of that, because that's part of the ongoing thing (investigation). But that's really the not direction that it's going,\" says Kaiser.\nKaiser says the location of the crime is a known foster home, but won't say if the two children involved were related or foster kids.\n\"It's very sad. She's so young,\" says Davis.\nThe sheriff says his deputies have been called out to the home before, responding to incidents involving juveniles.\nThe 13-year-old boy has been taken to the Jasper County Juvenile Office. The sheriff says it's too early to decide whether they will seek adult or juvenile charges. An autopsy has been scheduled on the girl's body. The Jasper School District is offering counseling for teachers and students.\nThis is the second recent tragedy for the Jasper School District. The superintendent says about a month ago, a second grade Jasper School District student was killed in a car accident near Wichita, KS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T21:50:54.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
