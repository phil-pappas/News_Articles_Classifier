It means a lot to be named the number one golfer in the state. The most consistent golfer through the year wins the award. It was definitely a great year for me, I was able to put up some good scores.\" \nAugenstein was aiming for a second straight KHSAA individual state golf championship this week at Bowling Green Country Club. He finished fifth and helped lead Catholic to a fourth-place team finish. \nAfter he had some trouble on the front nine in Wednesday's second round, and it appeared he was slipping out of individual championship contention, Augenstein settled in with helping the team, and going for a top five finish. \n\"You can tell him exactly what you're thinking, you don't have to sugarcoat it, you don't have to baby him, you can just flat out tell him, and he will fight accordingly,\" Catholic coach Bretnea Turner-Thomas said. \"He is, in a lot of ways, the maturity on our golf team. I told him to fight for what you can fight for.\" \nAugenstein will now prepare for a college golf career at Vanderbilt University. He flew to Dallas on Thursday to meet his college roommate and drive to Stillwater, Oklahoma for a tournament this weekend. \n\"After this tournament, I will take a little bit of a break,\" Augenstein said, \"but as long as the weather is still good I will take advantage of it and get outside to play.\" Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:15:11.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
