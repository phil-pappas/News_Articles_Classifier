It’s the ideal appetizer if you’re into plates oozing with flavor, and it’s perfectly paired with a sweet cocktail or a craft beer. Photo courtesy of Deep Ellum Point Judith Fried Calamari, Grafton Street Pub & Grill. This tried and true appetizer is seasoned with sweet chili, peanuts, bean sprouts, and mint at Grafton. Photo courtesy of Grafton Street Pub & Grill Smoked Fish Guacamole, Loco Taqueria & Oyster Bar. The guac is fitting for a restaurant that prides itself on its seafood-Mexican fusion—it’s not overpoweringly fishy, it’s smooth and salty enough, and gets scooped with tortilla chips seasoned with salt, vinegar, and paprika. Plus, if you visit on a Monday, you’d also benefit from $1 oysters. Photo courtesy of Loco Taqueria & Oyster Bar Salty Pig Board, The Salty Pig. A carnivore’s dream, the Salty Pig Board comes with prosciutto cotto, lamb porchetta, and stracciatella all made in the restaurant’s kitchen with marinated olives and seasonal greens. Photo courtesy of The Salty Pig Crispy-Fried Pig’s Tails, Craigie on Main. Though messy to eat, the pig’s tails are sweet, crispy, and fatty nuggets of pork made with pickles, peanuts, and cilantro.

This dig has upped the brussel sprouts game by frying the vegetable and disguising the veggie taste with buffalo sauce and blue cheese dressing.

Their biscuits are huge, toasty on the outside, warm and soft on the inside, and offer a hint of a satisfyingly fatty taste when slathered with sweet honey butter.

If you’re smart, you’ll get both. Each pretzels comes with your choice of two dipping sauces, from IPA cheese to Maple Cider Icing. Photo courtesy of Harpoon Brewery Allston Wings, Lulu’s Allston. Get the smoked jumbo wings BBQ, buffalo, or naked, and soak them in Lulu’s homemade bleu cheese dressing. Photo courtesy of Lulu’s Allston Scotch Egg, The Gallows. Breakfast for dinner gets a fancy twist with a bite of crispy pork sausage wrapped around a soft cooked egg served with the gooey yolk. Appetizers are often meant to share, but considering the small size of this plate, we’d eat it solo. Photo courtesy of The Gallows Neptune Johnnycake, Neptune Oyster. The seafood pancakes of all pancakes, the johnnycake has a buttermilk base topped with creme fraiche along with Boston smoked trout, honey butter, and sturgeon caviar. Photo courtesy ofAna M.
