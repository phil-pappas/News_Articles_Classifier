The movie, which debuted Friday, follows Nathan as a high school running back who leads a newly integrated football team in 1970s Birmingham, Ala. and becomes one of Alabama coach Bear Bryant’s top recruits.\nBrother-director pair Jon and Andrew Erwin's modestly budgeted ($15 million) film is at once a biopic, an inspirational sports movie and a civil rights saga. It’s an effective combination that earned Woodlawn over $4 million its opening weekend on 1,500 screens.\nSEC NEWS: Spanning the SEC\nBut for sports fans, perhaps the most interesting part of Woodlawn is the football pedigree that helped create the finished product.\nCastille, a defensive back on Alabama’s 2011 and 2012 national championship teams, was originally picked out of an open casting call of hundreds to be the body double for the London-based lead actor Osy Ikhile set to play Nathan. When the actor pulled out of the project due to visa issues days before filming was set to begin, Castille was cast in the lead role on a recommendation from the film’s football coordinator Mark Ellis.\n“He’s standing in the line like all the 500 other kids, he’s got a running number on, but when he crosses that 40 and I hit the stopwatch and it was a 4.4 I was like, ‘Who’s that?’ ” Ellis said. “He stood out. You could see from day one he had the ‘It’ factor. Then by the time we pulled the footballs out on day three and I got to watch him run — listen, I’ve worked with Hall of Fame NFL guys — this guy was one of the prettiest runners I’ve ever seen. I knew the camera would eat him up.\n“So between the way he runs and as authentic as he is as an athlete, and the way that emotionally he carries the character, it’s not a big leap for him. It’s like an astronaut playing an astronaut.”\nIt was a perfect — and meaningful — role for Castille, a Birmingham native with strong family ties to Alabama.\nCastille’s older brothers both played for the Crimson Tide and ended up in the NFL and Castille’s father Jeremiah was an All-American defensive back who played on Bear Bryant’s last team at Alabama before playing for Tampa Bay and then Denver as a pro.\n“They thought it was great,” Castille said of his family’s reaction to his last-minute casting. “We’ve been around football our whole lives, we’ve known Tony … Who wouldn’t want to play a hero?”\nThe football scenes were populated with about 100 of the best available football players — many of them ex-college players — the south had to offer, and the core of the film crew have impressive football histories themselves.\nThe Erwin brothers started their careers in film as cameramen for ESPN. That sports background is part of what made the project attractive to Ellis, a former college player and now an industry leading football coordinator who’s worked on Hollywood’s most iconic sports movies including Jerry Maguire, Varsity Blues, and Miracle.\nIn part because of their background in sports, Ellis trusted the Erwins to work with him to make sure the football in the movie looked real. That meant watching tape, reading rosters, poring over rule books and teaching extras how to play football the way it was done in the 1970s in Alabama.\n“We immediately spoke the same language about sports and about how to shoot the action and cover it and how it should fit in the story,” Ellis said. “The older I get and the more I do of these things, and the more I do them with young kids — it’s great to work on the Any Given Sunday’s, the $90 million, $75 million projects — but at the end of the day you look back and you hope to be a part of movies like this with a great message.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://sports.usatoday.com/ncaa/sec/"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:38:28.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
