Dolan , the chairman of Madison Square Garden, and Isiah Thomas, president of the Liberty, revisiting a 2007 sexual discrimination lawsuit involving a former team executive in an interview this week with HBO Sports.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage James L.

Silver declined to specify a timeline for when the investigation would be finished.\nLoading... Go to Home Page »\nSite Index The New York Times News World U.S. Politics N.Y.
