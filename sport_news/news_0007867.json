Mauney wraps up PBR World Championship By KEITH FREEMAN Associated Press   25, 2015 - 1:41 amLast Updated: October 25, 2015 - 1:42 am   \nPlaces: Latin America and Caribbean (715) \n\nLAS VEGAS — J.B. Mauney wrapped up his second Professional Bull Riders World Finals championship in two years and also won his second finals round Saturday night. \nMauney, from Mooresville, North Carolina, earned a $1 million bonus for winning the world championship and could claim a $250,000 bonus if he is the winner of the event at Thomas & Mack Center. \n\"The adrenaline is pumping so much,\" Mauney said. \"There are no words that can explain it.\" \nHe headed into the fourth round in good position to take the season title. Brazilians Joao Ricardo Vieira and Kaique Pacheco had to be within 1,400 points of Mauney and still be in contention for the finals event average title heading into the finale Sunday. \nMauney won the round shortly after claiming the title, finishing with a 92.75-point ride on Bruiser. \nPacheco, the leader in the PBR rookie standings, moved into second place by scoring an 88 on Cowboy Phil during his re-ride after scoring 78.75 on Stuntin Like My Daddy. Pacheco needed to score at least 88.5 in order to stay in contention for the world crown, so Mauney claimed the season crown two rides before he won on Bruiser. \n\"It doesn't matter whether I won (clinched the world title) it or not,\" Mauney said. \"I say it all the time (that) if you're going to say something, it really doesn't mean a whole lot in interviews. So, you have to prove it to yourself every time. And bull riding is a sport where you get the option to prove it every time you nod your head. I heard him (the event announcer) say that I had already won it before I nodded my head. But I kept it in my head that I had to ride that bull to win it.\" \nVieira fell to third in the world standings after an 86.25 on Uncle Tink. Pacheco dropped 1,642.50 points behind, while Vieira was 1,715 back. \nMauney, who is seeking a record third event title, leads the aggregate standings with 270.25 points. Cooper Davis of Wharton, Texas, was second with 264.50. \nBrazil's Renato Nunes, the 2010 world and event champion, announced his PBR retirement after 11 seasons just minutes after he was bucked off of Gangster's Wildside. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:57:59.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
