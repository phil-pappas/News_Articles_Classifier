Those 1980s Mets were a powerhouse built around young stars Doc Gooden and Darryl Strawberry.\nKansas City came agonizingly close last year, pushing the Giants to a Game Seven at home before going down to defeat against valiant emergency reliever Madison Bumgarner with the tying run on third in the bottom of the ninth.\n\"I think it was a driving force for all of these guys back in spring training, knowing that we wanted to get back to that situation and get that one more run,” Royals leftfielder Alex Gordon said at a workout in advance of the Series.\nCONTRASTING STYLES\nThe Mets' success starts with their young pitchers - Noah Syndergaard, who hits 100 miles per hour with his fastball, Matt Harvey, who throws in the high 90s, the moving 96 from Jacob deGrom and all the strikeouts they log.\nThey combine that sizzle with curves and change-ups that can buckle the knees of batters braced for high heat.\n\"We’re going to strike people out,” said Mets manager Terry Collins.\nPower pitching has been combined with power at the plate by the Mets, who have soared this postseason with the home run surge by the astonishing Daniel Murphy.\nMurphy, who hit a modest, career-high 14 homers this season, carries an MLB record of six home runs in six straight games into the World Series and is backed by power-hitting Yoenis Cespedes and Lucas Duda in the Mets' batting order.\nThe Royals' pitching edge comes from a deep bullpen anchored by closer Wade Davis and flamethrowing set-up man Kelvin Herrera, who routinely reaches 100 mph himself, that preserves late-inning leads like clockwork.\nThen again, the Mets never trailed once during their four-game sweep of the Cubs in the NL Championship Series.\nKansas City relies on a different type of attack, standing second from last in the American League with 139 home runs, but second best in stolen bases with 107.\nThe Royals, including Lorenzo Cain and Alcides Escobar, AL Championship Series MVPs the last two years, make the most consistent contact in the majors.\nThe pennant-clinching run against Toronto demonstrated their resourcefulness as Cain raced from first base all the way home on a single by Eric Hosmer down the rightfield line.\n\"It was an unconventional way to score a run, but that was Royals baseball,\" said Kansas City manager Ned Yost. \"We did it on speed and athleticism.\"\n(Written by Larry Fine in New York; Editing by Frank Pingue)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:41:59.428+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
