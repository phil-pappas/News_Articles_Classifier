Staff photo by Erin Gray slideshow Last season, Milton beat Etowah soundly in a game that proved to be the difference when deciding a Region 5 champion, but this year’s Milton team is not the same one from a year ago.Milton (1-4, 1-2) lost many of its best players from last season’s state quarterfinal team, but it’s the things that have not changed that concern Etowah coach Dave Svehla the most.“They’re just really well-coached over there,” Svehla said of Milton, led by former Etowah assistant Howie DeCristofaro. “The thing that concerns me about their team, as it does every single year, is that they’re going to be fundamentally sound. They’re not going to make mistakes. We’ve played them three times since I’ve been here, and they don’t typically beat themselves. That’s going to be a challenge for us.”That place where Etowah (5-1, 3-1) will be challenged most is on defense. Milton has a big, relentless defensive line that could give the Eagles’ ground game some trouble. Svehla said the success of his running game will hinge on how his line executes against a solid Milton front.“Their defense is always good,” he said. “They’re very good at scheming stuff up. They’re very good at playing fundamentally sound. Their kids have gap integrity on defense, which is extremely important. We’re going to have to be really good with our steps and really good with our hand placement and just play disciplined up front on our part.”If Milton can slow down Etowah running backs Tyray Devezin, Trey Moore and Quorealus Smith, the Eagles will have to turn to the air for production. It’s something Svehla said he is comfortable doing.“We will do whatever we have to do to put ourselves in position to win,” he said. “I’m sure that Milton will game-plan to stop the run first. I don’t think that’s going to be any big secret, but I think we do have some capable players. I think Patrick Ferris does a nice job at quarterback, and I think we have some good receivers who are dangerous in the passing game. I don’t want to have to throw it 30 or 40 times, but I think we can pass when we need to.”Where the advantage seems to shift Etowah’s way is defense. A strength of the team all season, the Eagles’ defense will face off with a Milton offense that is scoring just 10.4 points per game, while being held in single digits on three occasions and without a touchdown twice.Despite the numbers, Svehla said Etowah’s defense cannot approach this game lightly. Defensive end Tykee Atkins, linebacker Bronson Rechsteiner and safety Stuart Head will be keys to keeping the Milton offense, led by SMU-bound quarterback David Moore, from having its breakout game.“They have some players, and we have to contain them,” Svehla said. “When you watch them on film, you see some guys who are very sound, and they have a good game plan. For us, we just can’t give up the big play, and we’ve done that the last few weeks. We have to make them run a lot of plays to get the ball downfield, and, if we don’t do that, we’re going to put ourselves at a huge disadvantage.”With one more loss likely eliminating Milton from playoff contention, Etowah will get Milton’s best shot tonight. It may seem like a possible trap game for Etowah, but Svehla said his team is in no danger of overlooking Milton.“None of our players or coaches care what our opponent’s record is,” he said. “It means absolutely nothing in terms of what we’re trying to do in preparation. When you add that Milton has put it on us pretty good two out of the last three years, we’re not a good enough team to not play as well as we can every week. We don’t have the luxury of not playing well and just stepping on the field and winning like some teams do. I promise you, our kids will not overlook anything.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:01:44.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
