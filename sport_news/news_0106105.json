Despite being the most popular features, only 7 percent of new car buyers were willing to pay for them in 2015.\nData shows drivers would be willing to spend a premium of $5,000 for an automated car, but they balk at the extra expense of proven and relatively affordable driver assistance systems, Mosquet said.\nNew auto safety technologies leave some drivers bewildered Tribune wire reports Many Americans buying new cars these days are baffled by a torrent of new safety technology.

Some features will automatically turn a car back into its lane if it begins to drift, or hit the brakes if sensors detect that it's about to rear-end someone else. There are lane-change and blind-spot monitors,...\n(Tribune wire reports) Mosquet said average consumer willingness to pay is 25 to 75 percent lower than current market prices for advanced driver assistance technology.\nFor example, a suggested retail price for combined adaptive cruise/forward collision warning/forward collision avoidance might be $1,500. Consumers said they would pay $470 for the same system, a difference of 69 percent.\nPark assist, a $250 option that alerts drivers of objects behind them or in blind spots, is seen as more desirable than less glamorous technology. Buyers said they would consider paying $190 for it. Consumers said they would pay $170 for a $400 lane departure warning option.\nThe study sponsored by the manufacturers association projects driver assistance technology prices will fall as orders increase.\nIn the meantime, the industry needs to reconsider the way advanced safety features are offered, Mosquet said. Instead of being bundled in option packages, features should be available separately.\nThe European new car assessment program's five-star ratings on crashworthiness include assessments of adult protection, child protection, pedestrian protection and safety assist technologies.\nHyundai ejects drivers in self-driving car viral video Hyundai has been aggressive with videos touting the advanced safety features of its 2015 Hyundai Genesis midsize sedan, which has earned a top safety pick plus from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the first rear-wheel drive luxury sedan to earn such distinction.\nEarlier this year, Hyundai...\nHyundai has been aggressive with videos touting the advanced safety features of its 2015 Hyundai Genesis midsize sedan, which has earned a top safety pick plus from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the first rear-wheel drive luxury sedan to earn such distinction.\nEarlier this year, Hyundai...\nRead the story By comparison, the U.S. assessment by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration measures passenger safety in frontal, side and rollover crashes. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety factors in safety assist technology, however.\nWhile the U.S. assessment needs major updating, forcing advanced safety equipment on consumers is not an acceptable strategy, Mosquet said.\n\"If we mandated it today, we will have serious problems,\" he said.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5619b0e7/turbine/sc-advanced-safety-feature-cost-autos-1015-20151010", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-53b428f4/turbine/chi-hyundai-ejects-drivers-in-selfdriving-car-viral-video-20140702", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5614014b/turbine/ct-safety-technologies-confuse-drivers-20151006"], "published": "2015-10-12T23:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:19:23.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
