Spartans top Vikings 40-20 to close league schedule By Corbin McGuire corbin@emporia.com emporiagazette.com | 0 comments \nTOPEKA — When Tanner Taylor sees a cutback lane he takes it. More times than not, it leads to touchdowns, which was the case in the Spartans’ 40-20 win at Seaman Friday night. \nTaylor finished with 181 rushing yards on 17 carries, three of which he took into the end zone on runs of 64, 21 and 15 yards. \n“I’m just making my reads like we do every day,” Taylor, a senior, said. “I got to give huge credit to the offensive line. They blocked their butts off today and we came out and got the ‘W’.” \nTaylor’s first two touchdown runs started on one side of the field, before the elusive quarterback reversed field at the perfect time. \n“That’s by design. That’s all me,” EHS head coach Corby Milleson said jokingly. “No, Tanner was terrific. Tanner sees the entire field. He’s a very, very special football player and some college is going to be very, very fortunate to have him.” \nEntering the second half in a 13-all tie, the Spartans, whose offense was hit or miss in the first two quarters, scored 21 unanswered to take control of the game. \n“We just had to play with enthusiasm,” Taylor said of the second half. “The first half we were stagnant on offense and defense. Halftime got us fired up and we came out and started rolling.” \nEmporia amassed 374 yards on the ground, gaining 232 of them in the second half. \nSawyer Slayden recorded 107 of his season-high 117 rushing yards in the second half, behind two 27-yard runs and a collection of four- to seven-yard gains. \n“Our offensive line stepped up a lot,” Slayden said of the second half. “They were getting a lot of movement up there and it allowed us to move the football more effectively than we did in the first half.” \nNick Kirmer, who scored twice, including a 19-yard touchdown early in the fourth quarter to put his team up three scores, contributed 41 yards on the ground on nine carries. \nA key difference for Emporia in the second half was its production on first downs, which frequently resulted in negative yardage in the first half. Most of the improvement came down to execution. \n“We just weren’t playing very well in the first half with missed assignments and missed blocks, a litany of things,” Milleson said. “We corrected it in the second half and it was a different ballgame.” \nSeaman relied almost entirely on its passing game to move the ball, gaining just 49 yards on the ground, including 14 from its top running back in Colton Moranz. \n“We got a great defense,” Slayden said. “We still think our secondary needs to step up a little bit. We’re giving up a little too much and we need to be a little more physical, but that second half was pretty good. We still need to show up for a full game.” \nSeaman’s Dalton Cowan threw for 229 yards, including two touchdown passes. Nick Steiner was on the receiving end of 12 of his passes, accounting for 163 yards. \n“Aside from a couple passes, we played very well in the secondary,” said Milleson, whose defense stopped Seaman’s final drive with an interception from freshman corner Brent Hastert. “And we haven’t done that at all this year. To be aggressive the way we were, to force them to do some things that they really didn’t want to do, I’m proud of how that entire 11 played defensively.” \nBoth teams traded scores in the first half, with Emporia scoring on the game’s opening drive when Taylor busted off a 64-yard run into the end zone. Kirmer put Emporia up 13-6 on a 2-yard run in the second quarter, but Steiner won out a jump ball for a 31-yard touchdown reception with under a minute to play to head into the locker room tied. \n“(Coach) challenged us personally (at halftime),” Slayden said. “He challenged our character, so we had to step up for him. We know he cares a lot about us so we had to do it for him.” \nEmporia’s defense forced Seaman into a three-and-out to start the second half. The offense took advantage of a short field and took a 20-13 lead on a 2-yard sweep play to JeMarcus Morehead. \nOn second-and-19 on the following drive, Taylor scrambled to the right on a pass play before planting his foot, heading the other direction and making multiple Vikings miss en route to a 21-yard score to seize the momentum of the game for good. \n“He’s awesome,” Slayden said of Taylor. “He’s got a tremendous heart so he’s never going to give up.” \nThe Spartans finished Centennial League play 3-3, with their district schedule starting next week at Kapaun. \n“We’re heading in the right direction,” Milleson said. “We got to get hungry again. We just got to make sure we’re playing on all cylinders these next three weeks because our district is no joke.” \nEmporia (3-3) 7 6 14 13 – 40 \nSeaman (0-5) 0 13 0 7 – 20 \nEH — Taylor 64 run (Dobbins kick) \nTS — Cowan 2 run (Bassett kick no good) \nEH — Kirmer 2 run (2-point try no good) \nTS — Steiner 31 pass from Cowan (Bassett kick) \nEH — Morehead 2 run (Dobbins kick) \nEH — Taylor 21 run (Dobbins kick) \nEH — Kirmer 19 run (Dobbins kick) \nTS — Sykes 13 pass from Cowan (Bassett kick) \nEH — Taylor 15 run (Dobbins kick no good) \nGAME IN FIGURES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:06:18.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
