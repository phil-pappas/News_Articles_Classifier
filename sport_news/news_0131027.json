(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) In limiting innings during the regular season, the hope was it would serve the pitchers' long-term interests and also would help in case the Mets ended their eight-season playoff drought. The extra rest would allow the starters to go full throttle in the most important games.\nThus far, that planned has worked to fruition.\n\"I think they've really benefited from it, and realized the rest we've been able to give them and what has happened after the rest has been extremely powerful,\" pitching coach Dan Warthen said after a brief workout at Wrigley Field on Monday afternoon.\n\"The innings, the pitches, pitch counts, strikeouts, everything goes up and their velocity hasn't gone down. The program we set up this year has been overwhelmingly good.\"\nThrough the first seven games of the playoffs, the Mets' young starters have shined and helped the team grab a 2-0 series lead in this best-of-seven NLCS. The starting quartet, which never had started a playoff game before, has bested Clayton Kershaw, Zack Greinke, Jon Lester and Jake Arrieta this postseason.\nJacob deGrom starts tonight and aims to give the Mets a 3-0 series lead over the Cubs.\n\"Are they over the limits? Yes. But I think the rest that we've tried to allow them to have — push them back [a day on starts], watching the pitch counts during the games — I think it all adds up,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said. \"The intensity level and the adrenaline on this stage — you're not just as tired as you think you are. I think a lot of that is added into the fact that we've tried to keep them rested, and I think it's worked out.\"\nKnowing all four of their young starters in deGrom, Matt Harvey, Noah Syndergaard and Steven Matz would set career highs in innings pitched if they stayed healthy, Mets brass established ways to limit the starters' innings and prevent late-season shutdowns.\nA six-man rotation was used at times, and in the final two months of the regular season the team skipped scheduled starts for the youngsters when necessary. Harvey, who has set a career high with 202 innings pitched, was skipped twice and had a shortened outing against the Yankees.\nThe reins have been off since the postseason started, and the Mets are reaping the rewards. DeGrom and Harvey both are 2-0 in the playoffs, with deGrom defeating Kershaw and Greinke in his two starts. Syndergaard bested Arrieta in Sunday's Game 2 of the NLCS, and Matz is the only one of the four who has yet to win a postseason start.\n\"I think we have done a really good job,\" Warthen said. \"They're seeing the residue of the rest and everything that's happened. They watch maybe an Arrieta go out there or a Carlos Martinez go down, they start to realize our No. 1 concern is their health for years to come and the New York fans to watch these guys for years to come.\"\nFor as much as the Mets have done, though, there still is always concern about fatigue setting in. DeGrom takes the ball tonight for the third time in the postseason, and in his last start in Game 5 of the division series, he outpitched Greinke to lead the Mets to the NLCS.\nThe Mets skipped deGrom late in the regular season when he was struggling in order to give him a breather, but he enters tonight's game off back-to-back intense outings against the Dodgers.\n\"Is there a fatigue factor? There may be. This is Jake's third game now on the big stage in a short period of time,\" Collins said. \n\"Hopefully he's 100 percent ready and he's locating the way we know he can, and if he does, he's going to get people out.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:23:15.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
