John Alexander, the commander of the Seventh Fleet's Battle Force.\nThe Reagan was part of a three-carrier swap of home ports. The USS George Washington, which had been based at Yokosuka, stopped in San Diego for about a month and is now on a voyage that will end in Virginia, where its nuclear power plan will be refueled.\nThe Reagan is 11 years newer than the George Washington.\nThe USS Theodore Roosevelt will make San Diego its home base when it completes its current deployment to the Middle East.\nAbout two-thirds of the crews of each ship will stay at their current bases, saving the Navy an estimated $41 million in personnel transfer costs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:01:45.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
