The idea was that the helmets would glow in the dark. Pretty cool!\nExcept there's now a problem. Texas A&M's Halloween game isn't a night game, and it won't even end as the sun is going on. It will start at 11 a.m. and end in mid-afternoon, the SEC announced . So it seems the helmets are just going to look all black to everyone in the stands and on TV. Maybe shouldn't have tied this to one specific game, particularly against a pretty bad team.\nAdChoices Go to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://sbnation.com?utm_source=MSNbanner/", "http://www.goodbullhunting.com/rcb05/2015/8/7/9115643/a-m-reveals-details-of-new-black-uniform", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.secsports.com/article/13925084/week-9-tv-schedule"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:44:23.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
