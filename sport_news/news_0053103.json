The Tigers could also have a winning streak reach 10 games for the first time since 1983-84. A Miami win would likely slow down some of the criticism that a segment of the fan base is directing toward coach Al Golden and his staff, plus enhance the Hurricanes' Coastal Division chances.\nKEY MATCHUP\nClemson DEs Shaq Lawson and Kevin Dodd vs. Miami's offensive line. Lawson and Dodd have combined for eight sacks and 19.5 tackles for loss already this season. They will test a Miami blocking corps that has looked shaky at times through the first half of the season — which means Hurricanes QB Brad Kaaya might have to work quickly.\nPLAYERS TO WATCH\nClemson: WR Artavis Scott. He's averaging 125 yards of all-purpose yardage per game when factoring in his punt and kickoff returns, and his 39 receptions so far are more than any other two Clemson players combined.\nMiami: LB Juwon Young. With leading tackler Raphael Kirby out for the rest of the season because of a knee injury, Young moves into more of a feature role.\nFACTS & FIGURES\nMiami leads the nation in turnover margin, with 15 takeaways against just two turnovers. The Hurricanes have more interceptions in six games this year (11) than they had in 13 games last season (10). ... Clemson QB DeShaun Watson already has as many touchdown passes this season (14) as he had last season. ... Since Miami joined the ACC the Hurricanes and Tigers have met four times, with road teams winning all four and three of them decided in overtime. ... Clemson has played three times in Sun Life Stadium — but only once against Miami there. The Tigers lost to West Virginia in the 2012 Orange Bowl and beat Ohio State in the 2014 Orange Bowl ... Kaaya is seven yards from 5,000 for his career.\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
