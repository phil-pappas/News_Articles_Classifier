The clutch putt that turned a rookie into the hero. The stubbed chip that made the local star cover his face with both hands as if he wanted to hide. \nThe Presidents Cup, packed with raw emotion and endless nerves, was unlike any other over the last 10 years. \nExcept for the outcome. \nThe Americans won for the sixth straight time Sunday when Chris Kirk made a 15-foot birdie putt to win his match in a stunning turnaround on the final hole, and Bill Haas provided a storybook ending with the winning point for his team and for his father. \n\"A moment I’ll never forget,\" U.S. captain Jay Haas said, so choked up when it ended that he couldn’t speak. \nHaas used a captain’s pick on his son, sent him off in the 12th and final singles match at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea, then saw Bill Haas hold off Bae Sang-moon for a 2-up victory. \nThe 15 1/2-14 1/2 margin was the slimmest since the famous tie in South Africa in 2003. Not since 2005 has the Presidents Cup been decided by the final match. \nThat’s what the International team wanted when it demanded the number of matches be reduced (from 34 to 30). \n\"Irrelevant of the outcome — we obviously would have loved to have won — we put on a show of golf this week,\" International captain Nick Price said. \nThe final session was not without its share of heartbreak. \nAnirban Lahiri, the first player from India to make the International team, battled Kirk shot for shot over the final four holes and looked like a winner when he played a delicate pitch to perfection on the par-5 18th and had 4 feet for birdie. Kirk’s chip ran 15 feet by. Based on the status of other matches still on the course, it looked as if the International team finally would emerge a winner. \nThen Kirk made his putt on the final turn. Moments later, Lahiri missed. \nAnd then there was Bae, the only player under the Korean flag who was playing for the final time before he starts mandatory military service. When it became evident the Presidents Cup would be decided by his match with Haas, the American was 1-up and not giving away any shots. \nFacing a tough chip below the 18th green, Bae hit it heavy and the gallery groaned as it rolled back to his feet. He crouched over and covered his face as his caddie, Matt Minister, placed a hand on Bae’s shoulder to console him. Bae chipped about 12 feet by the hole, and when Haas blasted out of a bunker to 8 feet, Bae conceded the putt. \nPhil Mickelson had an unbeaten record (3-0-1) for the third time in a Presidents Cup, trouncing Charl Schwartzel. Zach Johnson also went unbeaten in easily beating Jason Day, the PGA champion and No. 2 player in the world who failed to win a match this week. \nThe series is 9-1-1 for the Americans since the Presidents Cup began in 1994, though the International team headed home with belief it’s getting closer. \nKorda’s pair of 4s \nKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Jessica Korda won the LPGA Malaysia for her fourth tour title with a four-stroke victory, closing with a 6-under 65 in sweltering conditions at Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club. \nAfter winning twice last season, the 22-year-old American entered the week with only one top-10 finish this year. \nShe made five birdies in a seven-hole stretch that ended on the 10th, dropped a stroke on the par-4 11th, and sealed it with birdies on the par-3 15th and 17th. Second-ranked Lydia Ko, No. 3 Stacy Lewis and 2014 winner Shanshan Feng tied for second. \nKorda cried on the 18th green after her final putt. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:25:51.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
