We're a bit worried. We'll see what the medical staff say. I don't know any details yet and until we know more, it's a worry – for both Silva and Morata,\" Del Bosque said. \nSpain later confirmed the worst thoughts over the City star through an official statement confirming he has been ruled out for the last Euro qualifier against Ukraine on Monday due to a sprained in his ankle. \n\"David Silva will miss the following match due to a sprained internal ligament on his right ankle after today's match,\" the national team said. \"The RFEF's medical services have gotten in touch with the services at Manchester City, who have received the relevant reports and the test carried out on the player.\" \nSpanish newspaper AS , meanwhile, claimed that he could face two to three weeks out of action despite the medical staff have refused to confirm a deadline. \nCity have a busy schedule ahead following the international break with a Premier League home game against Bournemouth before a crucial Champions League duels against Sevilla, on 21 October, and the visit to Old Trafford four days later. Should the reports from Spain be true, it is doubtful Silva will be in that game, while he could return for the Capital One Cup game with Crystal Palace or the Premier League game against Norwich on 31 October. \nThe news is a massive blow for Manuel Pellegrini just one day after Sergio Agüero confirmed he is is set for a month out with a hamstring injury suffered during Argentina's defeat against Ecuador. \n\"I think I'll be a month without playing,\" Agüero told TyC Sports in Buenos Aires.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T12:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:16:27.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
