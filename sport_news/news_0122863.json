They had a 41-22 edge in shots on Detroit, but Petr Mrazek was sharp in goal. \nLarkin, who extended his career-opening points streak to five games, opened the scoring 4:47 into the second frame when he flipped a backhander toward the net and saw it sneak past Carey Price's pad on the near side. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:43:22.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
