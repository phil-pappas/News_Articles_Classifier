Mosquera completed 5 of 8 passes for 78 yards.\nMost of the other scoring came courtesy of the defense and special teams.\nMaxx Imsho opened the scoring for Middletown South (4-0, 2-0) with a 67-yard interception pick 6, Coffey made an interception that set up Dube’s 10-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter, and Tom Marron scored on kickoff overage when he scooped up a fumble by Freehold Township (1-3, 1-3) and returned it 30 yards.\n“A great effort defensively,’’ said Middletown South coach Steve Antonucci. “Plus we scored on special teams. I tell the kids, if we’re going to win championships, the bottom line is we have to be good at all three facets of the game. If we can do that, we have a good chance for success.’’\nAll this came as the Eagles’ feature back, Cole Rogers, was sidelined by an injury for the second straight game.\nThe Rogers void was filled by junior James McCarthy, who rushed 17 times for 135 yards and capped the scoring with a five-yard run in the third quarter.\n“It’s great to have him in the No. 2 spot while your No. 1 is trying to heal up,’’ Antonucci said of McCarthy. “We hope to get Cole back next week and get him into the flow.’’\nHeavy rains, which continued through the game, left the field both bumpy and muddy, but Dube said, “We actually have a back practice field that gets pretty muddy and sometimes we practice there for a grass field game. So we knew what to expect.’’\nAntonucci said the Eagles made the most of the conditions.\n“It was like backyard football. You get muddy, you get sloppy, but you have a good time doing it,’’ he said.\nKey play: Middletown South’s first two drives ended in punts but Maxx Imsho provided the spark with a 67-yard pick 6 in the first quarter.\nOffensive game ball: Eagles’ junior James McCarthy rushed for 135 yards with a touchdown.\nDefensive game ball: Tom Coffey of Middletown South had an interception and a fumble recovery.\nUp next: Freehold Township hosts Toms River East and Middletown South hosts Howell Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:16:01.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
