Turnbull missing grand final excitement \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has lamented the lack of “people and excitement” in Melbourne a day before the AFL grand final. \n“Very peaceful trip on no 11 tram – eerily quiet on a public holiday! Miss the people & excitement of grand final eve,” Mr Turnbull tweeted from Melbourne, where he attended a meeting of the AFL Advisory Council. \nCrowd numbers for the annual AFL grand final parade are expected to be down this year due to the new public holiday introduced by the Victorian government. \nThe route has been changed for the first time in 38 years, with the parade to start in Spring Street and end at Yarra Park, next to the MCG. \nIn previous years, it took place in the CBD, allowing office workers to watch it during their lunch breaks. \nThere is expected to be a large contingent of West Coast fans on hand, with up to 20,000 having crossed the Nullarbor to see the Eagles play in their first grand final since 2006. \nHawthorn are chasing a third straight flag. \nThe parade begins at midday on Friday, with the temperature in Melbourne forecast to reach 27C.
