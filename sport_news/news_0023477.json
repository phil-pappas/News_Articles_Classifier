UW finished with 96 yards rushing and 322 yards passing. STEVE APPS — State Journal \nUW quarterback Joel Stave loses the ball on a sack late in the first half. Offensive lineman Michael Deiter recovered it, but Rafael Gaglianone’s ensuing 35-yard field goal was blocked. \nA year ago, the University of Wisconsin football team went off in October, blowing out opponent after opponent as it rolled through the soft middle of its Big Ten Conference schedule. \nIf the Badgers were going to do the same thing against what looked like a similar mid-season conference schedule this year, a game against Purdue on Saturday at Camp Randall Stadium seemed like a perfect place to start. \nSplitting down-to-the-wire games with Iowa and Nebraska to open Big Ten play was no real surprise for a young UW team with a new coach, but spending 60 quality minutes with the beleaguered Boilermakers seemed like just what the Badgers needed to launch themselves into the Big Ten West Division race. Purdue has won only one Big Ten game since 2012, has the conference’s worst run defense and — incredibly, given its history of great quarterbacks — struggles to throw the ball. \nBut instead of putting away the Boilermakers early, it was more of the same as UW, despite a huge advantage in yards gained, had to sweat out a 24-7 victory when its season-long problem of failing to finish drives with touchdowns continued unabated. UW’s continued offensive inconsistency made the game way more suspenseful than it should have been. \nIndeed, it was same old, same old in the opening half when UW outgained Purdue 272-61 yet held only a 10-7 lead. UW didn’t gain any breathing room until tailback Dare Ogunbowale scored on a 4-yard, wouldn’t-be-denied touchdown run on the final play of the third quarter that made it 17-7. By then, UW held a 350-78 edge in yards. \nBy all rights, UW should have had a sizable lead at that point and coach Paul Chryst should have been thinking about putting in his subs, but that’s not the way the season has gone for UW. The defense turned in a typically stellar performance against Purdue, but the offense once again couldn’t find a way to turn yards into points. \n“We did some good things,” wide receiver Alex Erickson said. “Third down was a lot better, which really showed. We really sustained drives. Now we’ve just got to get some more touchdowns, get some more points on the board. But we’re getting there. Slowly but surely, we’re getting there.” \nFor sure, UW’s offense has had much to overcome. No. 1 tailback Corey Clement hasn’t played since the season opener due to sports hernia surgery and, despite teasing the crowd by warming up Saturday, wasn’t deemed ready to play. The line, young and banged up to begin with, started its fifth combination in seven games Saturday. That has led to a spotty running game against every power-five conference team UW has played. Yes, even Purdue held UW to fewer than 100 yards rushing. \nLacking a big-play threat running or passing, UW’s offense has been forced to drive long distances for scores and a mistake usually seems to stop it before it reaches the end zone. \n“I feel like we’re just one play away every drive,” Erickson said. “Whether it’s a penalty or a missed opportunity to make a play, it’s just something like that that’s stopping us or putting it to a halt.” \nIt happened again against Purdue. UW marched 81 yards for a touchdown on its opening drive, but the rest of the half was an exercise in frustration as the Badgers marhced up and down the field but couldn’t pull away from the Boilermakers. \nUW’s second drive ended with quarterback Joel Stave, after needlessly stepping up into traffic, overthrowing wide receiver Rob Wheelwright near the goal line for an interception that set up Purdue’s only score. Its next drive stalled when tight end Troy Fumagalli was called for a chop block and UW settled for a field goal. The final possession shorted out when Stave was sacked and UW had a field goal blocked on the next-to-last play of the half. \nThe execution problems persisted early in the second half, when one drive was waylaid by false-start and delay-of-game penalties on consecutive plays and another was halted by two straight dropped passes, both in Purdue territory. \n“The execution is the common theme,” Chryst said. “I think the penalties (hurt). I thought we can still get better with Joel seeing the field and making some good decisions. I think (the passing game) would be better with location and guys running through it. We’re not getting a lot of yards after the catch. I think our inconsistency in the run game can hurt you.” \nOK, so we’ve established that a variety of things are holding back UW’s offense. You expected they would have been fixed by the season’s seventh game, but that’s not the case. \nIt could be as simple as getting Clement back because a consistent running game can cure a lot of ills. Whatever the solution, the Badgers know they have to start finishing off drives more often. \n“I wouldn’t say it’s frustrating,” Ogunbowale said. “We know we’re only one block away, one cut away, stuff like that, so it’s still positive. We think as the season goes on, as guys get more experience up front, things will start clicking for us. We’ll turn those long drives into seven points.” \nIt’s the only way this UW team is going to get on a roll. \nContact Tom Oates at toates@madison.com or 608-252-6172.
