Shabazz Muhammad also received some votes in that category.\nOther Wolves who got mentioned:\n* Zach LaVine finished third behind Russell Westbrook and LeBron James as the league's most athletic player. Wiggins also got some votes there.\n* Andre Miller finished fourth when GM's were asked what current player would make the best coach someday. Chris Paul, Mike Conley and Steve Blake finished ahead of him.\n* Ricky Rubio was voted fifth best passer, behind Paul, James, Stephon Curry and Rajon Rondo.\n* Kevin Garnett received votes for best leader, finishing behind James, Tim Duncan and Paul.\n* They received some votes for most improved team, which was won by Oklahoma City.\nFor the complete results, go here.\nAlso, CBS Sports picked its elite 100 players for this season and the Wolves had two guys make it: Rubio at 91 and Wiggins at 42.\nYou can see players 21-100 on that list here,\nMeanwhile with the Wolves, expect Sam Mitchell to continue to look at different combinations tonight, hopefully with more competitive results that Sunday's loss in Memphis.\nAlso expect to see Kevin Martin tonight. He has played little so far in the preseason, but should get regular-season minutes tonight and Friday so he can get in regular-season shape.\n\"My season starts tonight,\" he said at shoot today.\nMartin also reportedly was the best at Monday night's team-bonding bowling outing in Madison, even though he said he last bowled probably six years ago.\n\"I guess I'm just a natural athlete,\" Martin said.\nOlder Post Rubio making his Wolves preseason debut tonight", "external_links": ["http://www.nba.com/news/features/john_schuhmann/nba-com-2015-16-gm-survey/index.html?ls=iref:nbahpt3a", "http://www.cbssports.com/nba/feature/25345769/nba-elite-100-100-21"], "published": "2015-10-20T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:50:27.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
