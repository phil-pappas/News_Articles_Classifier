The news comes days after reports indicated he would not be on the sideline for the upcoming season. \nSaunders had been diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma in August, but it was thought his prognosis was good and he would be able to remain with the team. However, he took a leave of absence from the team in September when the disease worsened. It is with extreme sadness to report that today Phil “Flip” Saunders has passed away at age 60. pic.twitter.com/l8tthTocAt — Timberwolves PR (@Twolves_PR) October 25, 2015 \nCopyright 2015 Raycom News Network.
