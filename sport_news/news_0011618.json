Struggled again under the high ball and made poor decisions with the ball in hand. 5.5. \nADAM ASHLEY-COOPER: Named official man of the match after bagging Australia’s first-ever Rugby World Cup semi-final hat-trick with classic winger’s finishing. 7.5 \nTEVITA KURIDRANI: Was well contained by the Pumas after his barnstorming quarter-final against Scotland. 7. \nMATT GITEAU: Another mature display from the veteran midfield general, kicking cleverly and precisely in general play. 7.5 \nDREW MITCHELL: Missed five tackles in a helter skelter contest but more than compensated by beating eight defenders to set up match-sealing try for Ashley-Cooper. 7.5. \nBERNARD FOLEY: Pulled off two trysaving tackles, put Ashley-Cooper over with sublime long ball and returned to form after disappointing quarter-final in attack. 7.5. \nWILL GENIA: Provided silver service to his teammates and composed throughout, always making the right decision. Made a telling and courageous leap for late high ball. 8. \nDAVID POCOCK: Immense after returning from a calf injury. Stole ball as he does and made a series of big defensive plays. 8.5. \nMICHAEL HOOPER: Typically energetic and influential 80-minute display with and without the ball. 8. \nSCOTT FARDY: Got through a mountain of work, topping the tackle count and effecting three turnovers in a lion-hearted display. 8.5. \nKANE DOUGLAS: Continued his huge World Cup with 14 tackles – second only to Fardy – and providing a menacing physical presence in the middle of the park. 8. \nROB SIMMONS: Will never forget his second-minute intercept try that gave the Wallabies a dream 7-0 head start but also did his job at the set pieces. 7. \nSEKOPE KEPU: Tackled and scrummaged strongly and was busy around the ground. 7. \nSTEPHEN MOORE: Put his body on the line in a powerhouse defensive effort from the captain. 7.5. \nJAMES SLIPPER: Conceded repeated scrum penalties and missed several tackles in a tough day at the office. 6. \nKEY RESERVES \nNICK PHIPPS: Atoned for loose early pass with great ball to release Mitchell on his sizzling run. 7. \nGREG HOLMES: Added stability to Australia’s scrum after coming on with half hour remaining. 7. \nTOBY SMITH: Strong in the scrum and gave the Wallabies good go-forward in 25-minute cameo. 7. \nTATAFU POLOTA-NAU: Ran strongly but produced a couple of wobbly lineout throws and missed tackles. 6.5. \nBEN MCCALMAN: Had a strong impact in closing stages after replacing an exhausted Fardy. 7.
