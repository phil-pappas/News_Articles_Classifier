Yardbarker Oct 19, 2015 at 6:42p ET JOHANNESBURG Shares \n\nOscar Pistorius, the double-amputee Olympic runner who fatally shot his girlfriend in 2013, was released from prison and placed under house arrest on Monday night, a South African official said. \n\"Oscar Pistorius was placed under correctional supervision tonight,\" Manelisi Wolela, a spokesman for South Africa's correctional services department, said in a cellphone text message sent to journalists. \nWolela cited officials at Kgosi Mampuru II Correctional Centre, a prison in the South African capital of Pretoria where Pistorius had served nearly a year of his five-year sentence for manslaughter. \nThe correctional services department had originally said Pistorius would be released from the Pretoria jail on Tuesday in line with a decision by a parole board at the prison. \n\"The handling of the actual placement is an operational matter of the local management, and how they handle it is their prerogative that is carried out in the best interest of all parties concerned, the victims, the offender and the Department of Correction Services,\" Wolela said in a second text message. \nThe murder trial of Pistorius generated intense international interest, and the surprising decision to release Pistorius a day early, and at night, appeared to have avoided the logistical challenges and spectacle associated with a large gathering of TV crews and other journalists hoping to catch a glimpse of Pistorius on the way out of prison. \nWhile out on bail during his trial, the 28-year-old Pistorius had stayed at his uncle's mansion in an upmarket suburb of Pretoria. However, an Associated Press journalist outside the house said no one had gone in or out of the main entrance of the house on Monday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T09:11:17.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
