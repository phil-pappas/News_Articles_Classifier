Do I have a good toss? Do I have a good hand finish? Do I know where I want to put that ball? That’s the process and the outcome is what it is.”\nAnother important goal for IU during its practices this week was strengthening the cohesion during games.\nThe Hoosiers want to keep up communication on the court and come in with the right mindset.\n“We’ve been focusing a lot on our speed and our game, making sure everything is clicking on our side,” McDonald said. “I think we’ve all come in with the right mindset, mentality in every position. Front row, back row, setters, everyone. It’s going to be a good weekend.”\nA concern for IU is going to be playing the right side attack from Maryland.\nThe Hoosiers plan to anticipate the right side attack and contain the opposing player so they can continue to play at their normal speed on their side of the court.\nEven with the challenges presented last weekend, the Hoosiers said they want to work on overall growth as a team and for its players.\n“There’s no reason to panic this early in the season,” Dunbar-Kruzan said. “We’re not near our peak of playing, and we don’t want be. We want to just continue playing and see that through the season.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:29:26.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
