Mandatory Credit: Mark Zerof-USA TODAY Sports Steve Spurrier may have left the world of college football coaching, but his legacy will certainly live on through coaches like Auburn's Gus Malzahn -- who's also known for sporting the visor look.\nAdChoices In the wake of Spurrier's resignation announcement on Tuesday, Malzahn decided to pay tribute to the former South Carolina coach during Auburn's game vs. Kentucky on Thursday, going \"Visor free for the HBC\" in Lexington.\nThe visor Malzahn would have worn will instead be autographed and auctioned off in an effort to help victims of recent catastrophic flooding in South Carolina.\n. @CoachGusMalzahn is visor-free tonight to honor Coach Spurrier. http://t.co/9LIAkS8e2t pic.twitter.com/JShvTWmyXG\n— SEC Sports (@SEC) October 15, 2015 \"Coach Spurrier is one of the all-time greats, and his influence on me and my coaching style goes back to my days as a high school coach when I started wearing a visor,\" Malzahn said . \"I'm very appreciative for everything he's done for me and the game of football. He's played a large role in making Southeastern Conference football what it is today and will be missed. Going visor-free for tonight's game is a small way to pay respect to Coach Spurrier and help raise money and awareness for a great cause.\"\nMORE NEWS: Want stories delivered to you?
