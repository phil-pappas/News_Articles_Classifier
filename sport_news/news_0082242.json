We do have a game plan and we’ve prepared for them. But, we feel like if we go in there and don’t do mistakes — especially the things that hurt us — we’ll win the game. We’re just trying to focus on just us and being a little more consistent, and simplifying here and there.” \nDewey has been close to breaking through into the win column in district. \nTwo weeks ago, they dropped a two-point decision to Tulsa Webster, 21-19. \nBolstering Dewey’s hopes this week is the likely return of starting tailback Hunter Brewer, forced by an injury to sit out last week’s game against Locust Gove. \n“I think that’s a big lift for us,” Henley said about the second-year starting ballcarrier, but added his presence Friday in uniform is not guaranteed. \nAdding depth to Dewey’s crew of skill players is Cole Hawkins — a transfer from Caney, Kan., who had to sit out the first three weeks due to the transfer rule. \nHawkins has seen action in two games and displayed promise in the Dewey system, Henley said. \n“We think if he gets really comfortable with us, he’s going to help us,” the coach said, adding Hawkins will likely see time at receiver, runningback (in a two-back formation) and also start at cornerback. \nCaston Frye is maturing into a more dangerous threat at receiver, Henley said. \nFrye grabbed three catches last week, for approximately 60 yards. \nSenior Kobe Morgan is the Doggers’ leading pass target, Henley added. \nWhile Henley doesn’t want to put undue pressure on his young team, he indicated it’s not possible to downplay the significance of Friday’s game. \n“It’s a must win for us,” he said, in looking ahead to Dewey’s quest to make the playoffs. “We feel like if we play well we’ll win. .,, We’ve got to win to keep our playoff hopes alive.” \nHenley said he doesn’t believe playing on the road will diminish his team’s performance. \nHe’s been more concerned the past two weeks by extra-curricular activities such as Homecoming and the parents-teacher conference. \n“This week is just a normal week for us,” he added. “I think that structure is good for our kids.” Rules for posting comments \nComments posted below are from readers.
