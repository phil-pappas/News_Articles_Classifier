Moore will miss Saturday's game with Florida but could return as soon as next week against Western Kentucky, LSU coach Les Miles said Wednesday.\nSources told NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune Tuesday that Moore suffered an injured posterior cruciate ligament and would likely be out 3-4 weeks.\n\"I think he'll definitely be out of this game,\" Miles said on the SEC coaches teleconference. \"I'd like to think he could be back after the bye week. If he makes it back for Western Kentucky that would be super. We're hopeful he'll be back around that time.\"\nMoore, a 6-feet-3, 229 pound walk-on from Ruston, converted to fullback from tight end during the spring and is the lead blocker for Leonard Fournette when LSU runs from the I-formation. He was awarded a scholarship during fall camp.\nMoore was injured in the Tigers' 45-24 victory against South Carolina when he was tackled after catching a pass for a 1-yard gain.\nFreshman Bry'Keithon Mouton substituted for Moore during the game is is the likely replacement with freshman David Ducre' also scheduled to get additional snaps in practice, according to LSU coach Les Miles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:29:47.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
