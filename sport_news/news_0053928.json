Yes 35,000! Via an app called Flight Radar 24. \nTake a look at this video below. 35,000 Liverpool fans tracked Jurgen Klopp's flight to England online. THIRTY. FIVE. THOUSAND. https://t.co/he6bMwd9Q5 \n— FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) October 8, 2015 According to Flight Radar, Jürgen Klopp is expected to land at Liverpool's John Lennon Airport in the next half an hour #LFC ?? \n— Jarryd Subroyen (@Jazz_Subs031) October 8, 2015 \nYes, this is real. The company confirmed the figure to a CNN worker. Speaking of CNN, and the crazy effect Jurgen Klopp is having on people. The completion of his hire now means that the self-immolation of one well-known Arsenal supporter can begin. Former CNN host and Daily Mail columnist Piers Morgan made a tweet almost a year ago that he would self-immolate should Liverpool sack Brendan Rodgers and hire Klopp. Morgan, and the internet at large, is having a lot of fun with these Tweets this week. I'm beginning to over-heat. > RT @piersmorgan If Liverpool sack Rodgers and bring in Klopp, I will self-immolate. \n— Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) October 6, 2015 So depressed about Jurgen Klopp.He should be ours.Instead, Liverpool will get all the fun, excitement & rewards. #afc \n— Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) October 7, 2015 \nBy the way, self-immolation is defined as: \n“the offering of oneself as a sacrifice, especially by burning; such suicidal action in the name of a cause or strongly held belief.” Paul M.
