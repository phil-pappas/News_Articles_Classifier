(Photo: Wire photo) 1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nIn 2006, Memphis, Duke, Stanford and Temple combined to win four games all season. All four were in the Top 25 on Sunday, just nine years later. The lesson here is that there is no excuse for awfulness, and that every program can be successful if the right coach is hired and the proper commitment is made from its administration. \nThe harder part is the next step, to go from college football’s middle class to the truly elite. It’s something that Ole Miss and Mississippi State are finding out this season. Do you remember when 5-2 (both team’s record at this point) would have been something to be tickled about? Potentially bowl eligibility before Halloween? One team in the Top 25, the other team the last one out? \nThere have been a lot of years, some of them in the recent past, when such a thing would have been celebrated. Every coach gets a new contract, and there are Music City Bowl tickets under every Christmas tree in Mississippi. Those were the days, which have now come and gone. Fans have committed like never before, with their wallet and their presence. Davis-Wade and Vaught-Hemingway Stadiums will be full on Saturday when Mississippi State plays Kentucky and Ole Miss plays Texas A&M because they are big games for both teams but also because it’s just what happens now. \nThat kind of fan support has not been enough to stay relevant to the College Football Playoff conversation, though. A 5-2 record feels like almost anything is possible, but the odds are against either team winning out (ESPN’s Football Power Index puts the odds at 7.7 percent for Ole Miss, which feels too high post-Memphis, and 2.9 for Mississippi State). Eight- or nine-win seasons are still in play, and that’d be good enough for a trip to Florida come bowl season. That’s always nice. But it’s not like 2014; I was the Ole Miss beat writer then, and at the height of the madness I called my Mississippi State peer, Mike Bonner, and asked if he had a preference on the Rose or Sugar Bowl for the CFP semifinals. It was both a totally ridiculous conversation and one based in reality, given both teams were in the selection committee's top four at the time. \nNeither program has taken a dramatic step back. Remember that Mississippi State was a field goal away from beating undefeated LSU in Week 2, and it was just a month ago the entire college football world was in love with the Ole Miss team that beat Alabama. \nMississippi State and Ole Miss are both a little younger than they were in 2014, and injuries have not been kind to either side. That exposes you, revealing that while both programs have done an incredible job of accumulating top-flight talent that will play in the NFL, the kind of depth Alabama and LSU have come to expect is just not there. That takes more time and patience, and maybe not even then. Texas A&M has four straight Top 15 recruiting classes and still played in last year’s Liberty Bowl, and nothing says middling college football quite like a late-December trip to Memphis. \nBoth programs have redshirted players in recent years (Leo Lewis and Breeland Speaks come to mind) that in the past would have played immediately, which is the college football equivalent of hand-to-mouth lower middle-class living. Which is maybe part of the reason why the men in charge of finding a way to get Mississippi to the top and to stay there remain optimistic, both for the rest of 2015 and beyond. \n“We are a lot different (since the LSU loss),” Mississippi State’s Dan Mullen said this week. “That’s so early in the season you are trying to figure out who you are as a team. Guys have gotten more comfortable playing. We rotate more players now. … We are going to have a little more identity of what our team is this year at this point.” \nSaid Ole Miss’ Hugh Freeze: “At the end of the day, every man has to decide his role and what that means to him. We are going to do our best to motivate them to be confident that we will play with great passion Saturday.” \nThis is life trying to go from good to great: stay the course and hope it all eventually clicks. \nContact Hugh Kellenberger at hkellenber@jackson.gannett.com.
