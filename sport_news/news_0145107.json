(AP) — Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials have euthanized a bear that had attempted to eat trash at a Colorado Springs home and was shot by the homeowner.\nThe Gazette reports (http://bit.ly/1VtnB5Y ) that Colorado Springs police responded early Thursday after the homeowner said he shot the bear in self-defense. The bear was badly wounded in the right shoulder, which led wildlife officials to put it down.\nThe homeowner says the bear got through the patio fence and started rummaging through trash. The man unsuccessfully tried to scare the bear away by banging on pots and pans and throwing a flower pot at the ground near the bear.\nWildlife spokesman Kyle Davidson says bears are looking for calories to last them through winter, making them aggressively search for food.\n———\nInformation from: The Gazette, http://www.gazette.com\nAdvertisement", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1VtnB5Y"], "published": "2015-10-02T13:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:03:00.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
