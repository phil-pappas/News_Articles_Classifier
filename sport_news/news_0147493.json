The apex court, which declined to pass a direction on the BCCI’s plea seeking clarification whether Srinivasan was eligible to participate in board meetings, said Srinivasan was also free to question the correctness of the board’s view in a court of law. The BCCI had told the SC that Srinivasan still had a conflict of interest despite his claims that his company, India Cements Ltd (ICL), had offloaded its stakes in Chennai Super Kings (CSK), a franchise of the IPL. The BCCI’s senior counsel KK Venugopal had pleaded with the Bench, headed by Justice TS Thakur, that the ICL offloading its stakes in CSK was a “sham” as the shares had been transferred to the Shareholders Association of the ICL, a newly set up trust, which in no way diluted Srinivasan’s interest in CSK. Srinivasan is the vice-chairman and managing director of the ICL. Srini withdraws perjury charge against Thakur Appearing for Srinivasan, senior advocate Kapil Sibal said that his client was not pressing his charges of perjury against BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur. Sibal did not give any reason for the move. Srinivasan had filed an application in the SC, pleading with the Bench to proceed against Thakur for misrepresentation of facts and committing forgery in related proceedings in the court. Sibal, however, said the BCCI had not passed any resolution stating that Srinivasan still had a conflict of interest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:09:24.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
