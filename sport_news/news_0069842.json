John Tlumacki 'Donnie is the guy' \nAP photoBoston Bruins GM Don Sweeney answers a question as coach Claude Julien sits next to him during Boston Bruins media day yesterday 'Donnie is the guy' \nRemember when? Kyle W. Croston, was 4 years old and from Haverhill when he met future Boston Bruins general manager Don Sweeney at a local event. His good friend and then-teammate Ray Bourque, is on the left, and even farther down the table is ex-Bruin and North Andover native Steve Heinze. This photo was from December of 1995.File photo by Carl Russo.   2:00 am \nIf Don Sweeney needs an agent for, hopefully, his next contract, I've found the perfect candidate: \nRay Bourque. \nThe pro hockey legend isn't one to chase controversy, point fingers or publicly berate anybody. It's just not his nature. \nBut Bourque wasn't exactly thrilled with what he saw on the ice for the Boston Bruins last winter -- he has a suite for all home games -- and you get that drift when hearing the Hockey Hall of Famer, who played 21 years here, talk about the new guy in charge. \nHis friend and former defensive linemate Don Sweeney, the new Bruins general manager. \nWhen Sweeney was hired he all but promised the Bruins will have a renewed focus on bringing more \"aggression\" to the rink each night. Like the old days. Like the days Bourque, Cam Neely and Sweeney were guiding the ship in the 1980s and early 1990s. \nBourque couldn't agree more as the Bruins prepare to open the season on Thursday night against the Winnipeg Jets at the TD Garden. \n\"When I think about a Bruin I think of a guy that's going to go out there, prepare hard, play hard and do whatever it takes to win hockey games,\" said Bourque. \"It means more physical play, sure. It means showing up doing what you need to do to make a play. I mean 'physicall' in terms of getting dirty, putting your nose in dirty areas and winning more than your share of battles. \n\"That's the kind of player Donnie Sweeney was,\" said Bourque. \"And that's the kind of person he is now. You're not going to find people that work harder, are more prepared or have the passion of Donnie. The Bruins chose the right guy.\" \nBourque said his respect for Sweeney as a player was evident from Day 1. \nNot only was Sweeney smart -- he was a Harvard University graduate by the way -- but he was tough. \n\"You don't play the position he played at his size (5-foot-10, 185 pounds), the way he played it, without having a lot of grit,\" said Bourque. \"I always could trust him. I knew where he'd be on the ice. He always had my back. I really respected him as a player.\" \nAs a front office guy, Bourque's got not done throwing accolades Sweeney's way. \n\"He was a player. He then worked with the team in player personnel,\" said Bourque. \"He scouted amateur (and pro) hockey. He was involved in the pro system in Providence. He was around Peter Chiarelli a lot here in Boston. \n\"Donnie has done it all,\" said Bourque. \"He's knows what the Bruins are all about. He's ready for this job.\" \nThat being said, Bourque said it won't be easy. Not in this climate of salary caps, which have changed the way the game is played and managed. \n\"It's a lot different trying to assemble a team with salary cap, with salaries going up, signing guy to long-term deals, etc.,\" said Bourque. \"There are only so many guys you can fit. You have to have the right core. And then when you do that, handle the younger players who come up and eventually demaind more money. It's a tough job.\" \nBut ... \n\"Donnie knows how this city runs,\" said Bourque. \"He played here. He's been with the team for a while now in management. And I know he is committed to bringing in character guys. Obviously you have to have skill and speed. But to win (at a high level) you need guys that have a lot of pride in what they do and how they do it. \n\"They need to have each others' backs and play for each other.\" \nAccording to Bourque, it sounds like Sweeney needs to find more players like, well, Sweeney himself. \n\"Yes,\" said Bourque. \"I really have confidence in Donnie that he'll get it done. He and Cam (Neely) know what it takes to win. I'm very happy. The Bruins are in good hands.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:58:07.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
