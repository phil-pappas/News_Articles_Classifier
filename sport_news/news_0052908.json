Will Dickey Fletcher's Ronnie Stevens tries to escape the tackle attempt of Columbia's Xavier Rose on Friday at Fletcher. \nColumbia brought some clarity to the area’s most confusing football district. \nThe Tigers erased a halftime deficit with a furious second half and knocked off host Fletcher 42-26 on Friday night to clinch the District 2-7A title. \nColumbia won’t have to worry about any sort of Week 10 playoff scenarios or any kind of district shootout that a bunched-up 2-7A offered. Kamario Bell rushed for two of his three touchdowns in the second half and the Tigers slammed the door shut on Fletcher’s bid for the top spot in the district. \nColumbia (7-1, 3-0 in 2-7A) clinched the title after Atlantic Coast beat First Coast 26-20 to give Tigers coach Brian Allen the second title of his five-year tenure. \nFletcher (5-3, 1-2) visits Lee (5-3, 1-2) next Thursday with the playoffs still very much in sight. \n“Atlantic Coast definitely took care of us tonight, big time,” said Allen, whose district-title win in 2012 had taken a back seat to three runner-up spots. “We didn’t want any of that, where it was for all the marbles [next Friday vs. First Coast].” \nThe Senators (5-3, 1-2) led at halftime, but two plays changed their course. \nFletcher stretched a drive all the way down to the Columbia 1, but stalled when a bad snap forced the Senators to settle for a Cesar Sanchez field goal. \nBell responded with a 34-yard scoring run two plays into the fourth quarter and a 28-19 Tigers lead. \nFletcher surged back, converting a pair of fourth downs on Alec Adamec runs and putting Sanchez in position for a 48-yard field goal try with 5:02 to play. \nIt hit the cross bar. \nBell’s 57-yard run on the following drive put the Senators into the familiar position of having to reach the postseason as district runner-up. Fletcher has reached the postseason in eight consecutive seasons, the last five of those as the district’s No. 2 team. \n“We were right there in the fourth quarter,” said Fletcher coach Ricky Medlock. “We drive down the field and kick the field goal and it hits the post. We hit that and were within five points and we’ve got a chance to win the game. Lake City’s just a better team. They proved it out there tonight.” \nBell rushed for 179 yards on 22 carries and quarterback Davin Schuck finished 10-of-20 for 142 yards and a pair of touchdowns. \nAdamec finished 12 of 25 for 245 yards and scoring passes to Roscoe and Ronnie Stevens. Stevens also returned a kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown. \n“We knew it’d be a good game, that they were going to come out and give us all they got,” Bell said. “We knew we had to bring it. I’m speechless.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T18:38:56.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
