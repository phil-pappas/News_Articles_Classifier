Bartolo Colon relieved, and Howie Kendrick hit a grounder up the middle. \nSecond baseman Daniel Murphy flipped to Tejada, who took the throw awkwardly for an apparent force as Utley slid past the bag and slammed into him, causing Tejada to flip over as the tying run scored. \nTejada was put on a flatbed vehicle after a brace was placed on his leg. \nKendrick was ruled safe on a video review, which determined Tejada’s foot missed the bag. Utley also appeared not to touch the base. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:21:40.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
