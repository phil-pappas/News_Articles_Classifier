The ban is effective immediately,\" said a statement released by the committee's adjudicatory chamber. \nWorawi was a FIFA executive committee member for 18 years until May and has faced multiple allegations of wrongdoing. \nThe Asian Football Confederation voted this year to replace him as one of Asia's representatives on the FIFA executive. \nFIFA did not give details of the breach it found Worawi had been investigated for. \"The case is now the subject of formal investigation proceedings,\" it said. \nHe has in the past been accused of misusing FIFA development funds, but has always denied the charges and never previously been sanctioned. \nBritish media reports, never confirmed, said Worawi was one of five officials under investigation by FIFA's ethics committee for alleged misconduct in votes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. \nHe was found guilty in July by a Thai court of forgery in his reelection as head of the Football Association of Thailand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:35:40.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
