I think we’re playing pretty good defense. At times, offensively, we’re playing really well. We’ve just got to be more consistent on offense.”Wilkie and his receivers tormented the Woodland defense for the entirety of the game. In the first half alone, Wilkie threw for 249 yards, including touchdown passes to Trevor Kolb and Andy Davis.Wilkie finished the game 21-of-39 for 420 yards and three touchdowns. He also ran for two touchdowns.“Throwing the ball, Kyle’s special,” Crowder said. “I’m going to miss him when he’s gone. He’s a great kid and a great quarterback. He’s fun to coach.”The trio of Kolb, Davis and his brother, Brian, wreaked havoc on Woodland as they combined for all of Creekview’s catches and receiving yards. As impressive as the Grizzlies’ offense was, the defense more than held their own. They shut down Woodland’s option attack, holding the Wildcats to 104 yards rushing on 43 carries.“For the most part, I was pleased with the way the defense played,” Crowder said. “You don’t see (the option offense) hardly at all. They’re doing a great job with it.”The combination of Wilkie’s arm and a stalwart defense allowed Creekview (4-3, 3-1) to build a 21-0 halftime lead. It was a lead the Grizzlies never relinquished.Woodland (1-5, 1-2) did manage to create some tension in the second half. The Wildcats took advantage of a Wilkie interception in the second half and cut the Grizzlies’ margin to 14 as time expired in the third quarter when quarterback Grant Robinson connected with Jonathan Applin on a 16-yard touchdown pass.The Wildcats’ offense found some success in the second half with their passing game. As the Grizzlies’ loaded up the box to stop the run, Woodland exploited some gaps in the secondary and got its playmakers isolated in space.Applin was the star for Woodland. In addition to intercepting Wilkie, the senior finished the night with 138 yards on five catches, including an 85-yard touchdown catch that saw him outrun the Creekview defense for the final 80 yards.That was as close as the game got, as Wilkie led the Grizzlies on a six play, 69-yard scoring drive, capped off by 4-yard touchdown run by Cade Radam.“We just had to refocus,” Crowder said. “Once we got back refocused, we were OK.”One week before Creekview travels to Sequoyah, it got a boost from their archrival’s win over Cass. It left the Grizzlies with the edge atop the subregion, one game ahead of Cass and a half-game ahead of Dalton, whose game with Rome was delayed by lightning Friday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:02:25.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
