(Image Source: Giants.com) \nHere’s a look at the Monday Night Football matchup between the Philadelphia Eagles and the New York Giants: \nSeries: Giants Lead 82-76-2; Streaks: Eagles won 5 of past 7; Last Meeting: Eagles 34, Giants 26 (12.28.14) \nTime: 8:30 PM ET; TV: ESPN (Mike Tirico, Jon Gruden & Lisa Salters) \nSpread: Eagles -4 ½; O/U 50 ½ \nInjury Report: Giants: Out: CB Prince Amukamara (pectoral), LB Devon Kennard (hamstring), WR Victor Cruz (calf); Questionable: DE Robert Ayers (hamstring), WR Odell Beckham (hamstring), CB Trumaine McBride (groin), LB Jon Beason (concussion), LB Jonathan Casillas (calf); Questionable: DE George Selvie (calf), OG Justin Pugh (ankle), WR Rueben Randle (hamstring) \nEagles : Out: WR Nelson Agholor (ankle), LB Kiko Alonso (knee), DE Brandon Bair (groin), LB Mychal Kendricks (hamstring); Questionable: RB Ryan Matthews (groin) \nWhere They Stand: The New York Giants started the season by blowing two double-digit fourth-quarter leads but have rebounded to win three straight to move into first place in the NFC East. After also dropping their first two games, the Philadelphia Eagles have won two of three and they can pull into a first-place tie with the G-Men if they can hold serve at home tonight. \nThe Giants: No quarterback is more durable than Eli Manning , who has now started 172 straight games, the longest active streak in the league. With 102 career victories, he’s also the winningest QB in franchise history. Manning is coming off a career game, which saw him throw for 441 yards on a Giants record 41 completions. Manning has thrown for over 400 yards seven times, including in his last meeting versus the Eagles. A big key tonight is the health of Odell Beckham Jr. who is coming off a seven-catch, 121-yard effort last week and went off for 185 yards the last time these rivals met. Opposite Beckham is fellow LSU alum Ruben Randle , who twice has caught two TD passes against Philly, and had 158 receiving yards in his least meeting against the Eagles. Also keep an eye on TE Larry Donnell in the red zone, as well as RB Shane Vereen (8 catches, 86 yards, TD last week) coming out of the backfield. RB Rashad Jennings can contribute both as a runner and pass catcher, putting up 176 scrimmage yards in his last game versus the Eagles. The G-Men will be without CB Prince Amukamara , putting a little extra pressure on former Eagle, CB Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie (6 career TDs) to play big tonight. First-year LB Uani ‘Unga has 35 tackles to lead the team and his two INTs are the most among LBs. \nThe Eagles: QB Sam Bradford threw for 331 yards in his only meeting against the Giants, and he’s coming off his second 300-yard game as an Eagle. Just like the Giants need a healthy ODB, the Eagles throw game relies heavily on WR Jordan Matthews , who had eight catches for 105 yards in their last meeting. For the Eagles offense to really click they need their running backs to contribute. Last week, both DeMarco Murray (249 yards vs. the NYG last season) and Ryan Matthews (team-high 205 rushing yards; 5.0 YPC) scored TDs. One of their top all-around producers is Darren Sproles , who is the only player in the history of the NFL with 25 rushing TDs (27), 15 receiving scores (18) and at least five trips to the paint on punt returns (6). A key tonight will be Philly’s ability to get to the QB. DE Fletcher Cox had a career-high three sacks last week, as well as two forced fumbles and a fumble recovery. DE Vinny Curry had two sacks and OLB Connor Barwin recorded three sacks and a forced fumble the last time they played in Philly. With injuries in the linebacking corps, rookie Jordan Hicks has stepped up with 25 tackles, a sack, a forced fumble, three fumble recoveries and an INT in their past four games. \nPrediction: Eagles HC Chip Kelly wants to win by running the football and Sam Bradford has done very little to tempt him to change his philosophy. Philly swept the G-Men last year by running for 203 yards and 164 yards in their two meetings, however this season the Giants may have the most improved run defense in the NFL. New York is second in the league in rush D (80.6 YPG) and yards per carry allowed (3.5). The run D will keep this close and the combination of Manning to Beckham will win it, as the Giants hold on to first place. \nScore: Giants 23, Eagles 20 \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
