The Ducks, who visit Washington on Saturday, rank 93rd nationally in yards per play allowed, and 116th in scoring defense (38.7 points per game). Meanwhile, the Cougars play host to Oregon State on Saturday. Ryan Kang The Associated Press i \nThe Huskies play Oregon in Seattle while the Cougars face Oregon State in Pullman. \nHUSKIES’ OPPONENT THIS WEEK \nOREGON DUCKS (3-3 overall, 1-2 in Pac-12) \n7:30 P.M. SATURDAY, HUSKY STADIUM, ESPN2, 1000-AM/97.7 FM \nCOACH: Mark Helfrich (27-7 in third season at Oregon and overall) \nAGAINST THE HUSKIES: Washington leads the all-time series 58-44-5. \nSCOUTING REPORT: The Huskies haven’t beaten the Ducks since 2003 — an 11-game losing streak — but Oregon is as wounded now as it’s been at any point in that span. The Ducks are coming off their second surprising home loss of the season, a 45-38 defeat to WSU in double-overtime — the Cougars were 17-point underdogs — and that came two weeks after Utah blasted Oregon, 62-20, in Eugene. Oregon has struggled to find a replacement for Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Marcus Mariota. Eastern Washington transfer Vernon Adams won the starting job during preseason camp, but a finger injury has kept him out of Oregon’s past two games, and it’s unclear if he’ll be able to play against the Huskies (though it does appear there is a chance he will). While playing for EWU in 2014, Adams threw seven touchdown passes against UW at Husky Stadium in a wild, 59-52 Huskies’ victory. … Without Adams, the Ducks have alternated between Jeff Lockie and Taylor Alie, and neither has commanded the offense with much success. Oregon is likely to instead rely on its running game, led by sophomore tailback Royce Freeman, who has rushed for 859 yards and 9 TDs in six games this season. He leads a Ducks offense that despite taking a step back is still ranked 16th nationally in yards per play (6.7) and 10th in total offense (528.7 yards per game). … Oregon’s defense isn’t good. The Ducks rank 93rd nationally in yards per play allowed, and 116th in scoring defense (38.7 points per game). \nDID YOU KNOW? Oregon’s roster includes four players who list hometowns in Washington: DB Fotu Leiato (Steilacoom), OL Shane Lemieux (Yakima), LB Danny Mattingly (Spokane) and OL Calvin Throckmorton (Bellevue). \n2015 schedule \nSept. 5 W, 61-42, vs. Eastern Washington \nSept. 12 L, 31-28, at Michigan State \nSept. 19 W, 61-28, vs. Georgia State \nSept. 26 L, 62-20, vs. Utah \nOct. 3 W, 41-24, at Colorado \nOct. 10 L, 45-38 in 2OT, vs. Washington State \nOct. 17 at Washington \nOct. 29 at Arizona State \nNov. 7 vs. California", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:50:32.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
