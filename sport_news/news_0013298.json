Foster gone? \nThe running back turned wide receiver is one of the most athletically gifted players in all of the Pac-12, and yet he is an afterthought in this year's ASU offense. \nFoster has been a staple in Tempe over his career, and this season became only the fourth player in NCAA history to have 2,000 yards receiving and 2,000 yards rushing in his career. \nSep 26, 2015; Tempe, AZ, USA; Arizona State Sun Devils wide receiver D.J. Foster (8) against the Southern California Trojans at Sun Devil Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports (Photo: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports) \nThis year though, he's accounted for 468 total yards and three touchdowns. \nTo put that number in perspective, he accounted for 1,769 total yards last season. \nClearly the decision to make him a wide receiver hasn't worked out. \nThe local product out of Saguaro High School welcomed the change during the offseason though, and it was a logical move given all the depth and talent ASU had in its backfield. \nBut it's not working. \nFoster is a playmaker, and he needs to get more touches. \nOct 10, 2015; Tempe, AZ, USA; Arizona State Sun Devils wide receiver D.J. Foster (8) makes a touchdown catch against the Colorado Buffaloes during the second half at Sun Devil Stadium. The Sun Devils won 48-23.

Gone are the days of Foster catching bubble screens and torching defenses. \nNow D.J. Foster has become a receiver good for about four receptions and 50 yards per game. How has one of the most gifted players in the Pac-12 seen his career come to this? \nSun Devil fans can add the team's use of Foster to their list of head scratchers this season has produced. \nAs ASU heads into their bye week, it's time for some reevaluation. \nNo more talk of National Championships, or Pac-12 titles for that matter. \nIt's time to get back to the basics and highlight the best players on the roster instead of turning them into an afterthought.
