It's a good time to catch me.\"\nVedder grew up in the Chicago area and has remained a lifelong Cubs fan despite living in Seattle. He's good friends with Cubs president Theo Epstein, whom he met in Boston when Epstein was a relatively anonymous assistant general manager for the Red Sox.\nVedder tries to get to town whenever he can, and even thought of renting a place near Wrigley to see more games.\n\"But I have kids, so I have to stay close to home,\" he said. \"This has been a good year because of The Who benefit, and Theo's benefit, so that gave me good excuses. And spending the week with Theo is great because there were doubleheaders and there were like seven games in seven days, even though we had the night off to play the show.\"\nWhen in town, Vedder usually hooks up with his famous friends, the so-called \"Stanley's Mafia,\" a diverse group that includes Ryan Dempster, Chris Chelios, John Cusack and Kerry Wood. They all share a mutual friend, Donnie Kruse, who runs the North Side hangout.\nVedder's favorite Cubs player as a youth was outfielder Jose Cardenal. He said he switched from sitting in the right field bleachers to left when Cardenal changed positions.\n\"I was about 6 or 7,\" he said. \"He was No. 1. He had this great Afro. He was always smiling, he was colorful. I didn't meet him until he was here with the Reds at Wrigley about 15 years ago, and we've become really close.\n\"I talk to him a couple of times a week, especially lately. Just an amazing guy. His knowledge of baseball is just incredible.\"\nOne of Vedder's most memorable experiences occurred on the night of the 2013 Pearl Jam concert at Wrigley, where he brought Ernie Banks on stage with him and sang his Cubs' song, \"Someday We'll Go All the Way.\"\nVedder was distressed during the concert because of a long rain delay, but that delay led to a sublime moment.\n\"Looking back, what I didn't realize was I had an hour-and-a-half with Ernie Banks. I got to sit there in the visitor's clubhouse with my kids and talk baseball with Ernie Banks.\"\nVedder's relationship with Epstein dates back to 2002, when one of his crew members introduced him to the young baseball executive in Boston.\n\"He said 'Ed, we have this Theo guy and he'd love to say 'Hi,' \" Vedder said. \"He was such a great character, with such amazing character, and he has become one of my closest friends.\n\"We talk a lot, and Theo said 'This year you can probably play shows in October, but for the next few years, make sure you're not playing in October.'\n\"And here we go. So I have got to go to South America.\"\nVedder wasn't sure where he would be in South America during the World Series, but knows he will be preparing for Pearl Jam's South American tour, which begins Nov. 4 in Santiago, Chile.\nThat's also the date for Game 7 of the World Series.\nWhat if the Cubs are in a Game 7 during his Pearl Jam show?\n\"We could be in trouble,\" Vedder said, laughing. \"We'll see.\"\nSo where would he go to watch the other Series games if the Cubs make it?\n\"If I'm in a hotel room in Venezuela drinking a beer and crying by myself if the Cubs win it all, I'll be really happy,\" he said. \"That'll be just fine with me.\"\n(c)2015 Chicago Tribune\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1738332&h=Wrigley+Field+special+place+to+be+for+Eddie+Vedder", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1738332&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1738332"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:13:25.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
