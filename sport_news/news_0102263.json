(WUSA9) -- The University of Maryland chose D.C. native Mike Locksley to replace Randy Edsall as the team's interim head coach after Edsall was fired on Sunday afternoon. \nRumors had been swirling for several days that Edsall's days were numbered in College Park and the boom finally came down Sunday, ending Edsall's less than impressive tenure at Maryland. In four-plus seasons as head coach, Edsall's Terps never managed to beat a ranked team (0-12). \nHere's a few things to know about Mike Locksley as he prepares to take over for the Terrapins: Grew up in inner-city D.C. Attended Ballou High School Played DB for Towson State University from 1988-1991 Started coaching right after he graduated as a DB coach for Towson in 1992 Got his first head coaching job for New Mexico in 2008 Came home to the DMV-area in 2012 as the Terps offensive coordinator Locksley and his wife Kia have four children: Mike Jr., Meiko, Kai and Kori \nMake sure to watch our live coverage of the Maryland football press conference at 4 p.m. \nLike this story?
