Toni Vilander and Davide Rigon began the GTE-Pro qualifying in Ferraris no. 51 and 71 of AF Corse. The Finnish world champion clocked 1:38.647 on his first attempt, while the Italian driver of car no. 71 immediately put in his fastest time of 1:38.445. Vilander bested this with 1:38.4431 on his second lap. At that point James Calado and \"Gimmi\" Davide Rigon, driver Ferrari no. 71, pole position GTE-Pro: \"I'm delighted. It's our first pole position and were overjoyed about it. Even second place would have been fine, because the main thing was to be there with our teammates. In FP3 the car felt right but we couldn't make the time. Things changed for the better in qualifying and our 458 Italia was really quick. It's special for us and for Ferrari, but the serious points come in the race. James Calado, driver Ferrari no. 71, pole position GTE-Pro: \"I'm really happy for the team and for Ferrari. We took first and second place and this is good above all for the Constructors championship, which is our primary goal. Davide and I are growing a lot this season and this pole position is the result of our progress. The hard part comes now, with the race. We hope to win some important points for the championships and to have something to celebrate at the end of the day. However, our main hope is that it doesn't rain tomorrow, or at least that it's not torrential. Toni Vilander, driver Ferrari no. 51, 2nd GTE-Pro: \"They were certainly good qualifying. We and our teammates were competitive and this is a good sign. Davide and James did a great job. We worked a lot on the setup and in qualifying we weren't 100% sure how the car would behave. Second place on the grid is good for the race. I'd like to thank AF Corse, Michelin and Ferrari for the work they've done. Now we just have to hope the race isn't flooded out. Light rain isn't a problem. \"Gimmi\" Bruni Ferrari no. 51, 2nd GTE-Pro: \"The overall result is good. To start in second place behind our teammates and ahead of Ferrari's rivals for the Constructors' title is encouraging even though it would have been wonderful to record the best time. However, the race is long and anything can happen. Our primary aim is to win points for the Constructors' championship\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T14:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:53:13.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
