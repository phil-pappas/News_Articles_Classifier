Practices are more crucial right now, and at least according to the participants, things are going well there.\n“It’s all about getting adjusted to everybody’s game, getting adjusted to a new offense, style of play,” Pierce said. “That’s pretty much the main thing right there.”\nWith just more than a week left before the Clippers start doing this for real, they host the NBA champs, the Golden State Warriors, on Tuesday.\nAnd while there will be talk of things like rivalry and conference hierarchy, ultimately whatever happens at Staples Center on Tuesday won’t matter any more or less than what’s happening at the team’s practice facility.\n“Anything for us is important now because we have so many different players and units we want to jell together,” center DeAndre Jordan said.\nNow, this isn’t to say the Clippers don’t need to start playing better against other teams; they know they do.\nBut ultimately, any judgment passed on the Clippers this season won’t have to do with games in October.\nStill, the team will start to transition more toward regular-season play, Rivers said. The team could tighten rotations for a half or two in their final two dress rehearsals before the regular season.\nAnd while he acknowledged the Clippers’ struggles on the court, Rivers said he likes “where we’re at.”\nAnd where the Clippers are “at,” it seems, is a place where perspective outweighs panic.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:46:53.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
