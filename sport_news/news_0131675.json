The move opened a spot for Kendricks, a second-round draft pick out of UCLA. \nCoach Mike Zimmer says Kendricks has been playing like a starter for several weeks. \nKendricks says he doesn't see the move as a vote of confidence. He spent extra time over the bye week making sure he was prepared for the increased responsibility. \nThe Vikings host the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday. \nOnline: \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:42:02.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
