Then he clicked off the TV.\nIt wasn’t until the next morning that the potential parallels between that game and one that helped end his stint as Seahawks coach began to sink in.\nLike seemingly everyone else in America, Erickson said, “I didn’t know the rule, to be honest with you.’’ \nMost Read Stories Expect traffic delays when Obama visits Seattle Friday afternoon Huskies upset USC 17-12 and beat Steve Sarkisian, their former coach Win over USC puts UW’s coaching upgrade (Chris Petersen over Steve Sarkisian) on full display Lloyd McClendon will not return as Mariners' manager Even in death, 'Up' house owner Edith Macefield remains a mystery Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. He didn’t until Tuesday when he saw all the coverage of a sequence that could end up making Monday’s game as controversial as any played in the NFL this season.\nIn fact, K.J. Wright’s admitted intentional batting of the ball out of the end zone after Kam Chancellor’s hit caused Calvin Johnson to fumble just before crossing the goal line has caused many in the national NFL media to spend the week wondering if the replay system should be expanded even further.\nBack judge Gregory Wilson began to reach for his flag but stopped and did not call Wright for a penalty. If he had, the Lions would have taken over at the 1yard-line with 1:45 remaining, trailing 13-10.\nInstead the play was ruled a touchback, and the Seahawks got the ball at their own 20 and ran out the clock.\nNFL vice president of officiating Dean Blandino said later that Wright — who said he didn’t know he couldn’t bat the ball out of the end zone and just wanted to avoid fumbling it — should have been called for a penalty. Because it is a judgment call, though, it was not reviewable. So once Wilson declined to throw his flag, that was that.\nAmong those who think such a play should be reviewable is former coach Brian Billick, now an analyst for the NFL Network. He wrote on the league’s website this week that the NFL must expand the replay system to include “anything else that the referee needs help on’’ and added that “the screams of outrage after the Lions-Seahawks game will provide further incentive to do so.’’\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell, speaking after league meetings this week in New York, said replay “clearly is going to be reviewed again’’ in the offseason.\nIn 1998, Erickson just wished there was any kind of replay system.\nErickson was in his fourth season as Seahawks coach, a year regarded as make-or-break for his future with the team. \nThe Seahawks were 6-5 when they played at the New York Jets. With 27 seconds left, the Jets faced fourth-and-goal from the 5. From there, quarterback Vinny Testaverde famously audibled to a quarterback sneak. \nAnd though he appeared to all the world to be stopped a few feet shy of the end zone, the play was ruled a touchdown and Seattle lost 32-31. With no replay system to review it, the play stood as called.\nA few weeks later, at the end of an 8-8 season and with a 31-33 overall record, Erickson lost his job.\nThe play often has been cited as one of the driving forces behind the league instituting a full replay system the next season (there was limited use of replay from 1986-91).\n“I think it was the main reason, to be honest with you,’’ Erickson said.\nThat’s not much consolation for Erickson, though.\nSeattle still would have needed to win its final three games to get into the playoffs. (Interestingly enough, the last spot was grabbed by a 9-7 New England team coached by Pete Carroll.)The Seahawks won two of the last three, dropping the finale at Denver after playoff hopes were gone.\nStill, Erickson always has wondered what might have been had the Testaverde score been reviewable.\n“We were playing really well and didn’t get in the playoffs,’’ he said. “If we had, who knows?’’\nMike Holmgren was hired a few weeks after Erickson was fired, and the 1999 team won the AFC West.\nErickson hardly floundered, reviving his career at Oregon State and later getting a chance to return to the NFL with the 49ers in 2003-04. At age 68, he says he’s having a lot of fun assisting for a Utah team ranked No. 5 in the nation.\n“There’s a lot less pressure being an assistant, I can tell you that,’’ he said.\nErickson also noted that the Testaverde and Wright plays are different. The Wright play, he said, “is really just more of not knowing the rule for everybody involved.’’ In the 1998 game, it was simply a blown call.\nCount Erickson among those, though, who thinks everything should be reviewable, for one simple reason. \n“One game,’’ he says, “can affect a heck of a lot of lives.’’\nBob Condotta: 206-515-5699 or bcondotta@seattletimes.com .
