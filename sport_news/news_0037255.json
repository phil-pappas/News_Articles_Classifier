That figure fell to $15.2 million in August.\nUnder state law, 49 percent of gambling revenue from the slots parlor is returned to the state. Of that total, 82 percent goes to cities and towns for local aid and 18 percent goes to a horse racing development fund.\nThe state collected about $5 million in taxes from Plainridge in September, down from $6 million in August and $7.2 million in July.\n‘‘The revenue trends we’re seeing are largely consistent with other new property openings where you open strong, the numbers settle over the first few months, and then you typically see them ramp back up to a more normalized run rate as your marketing takes hold,’’ Lance George, Plainridge’s vice president and general manager, said in a statement.\nSeptember is also historically slower for business than the summer months of July and August, George said. The facility, owned by Penn National Gaming, recently completed an expansion of its high-limit slot area and officials are pleased with the pace of customer loyalty card sign-ups.\nPlainridge, located in the town of Plainville, also offers harness racing. It opened in late June and was forecast to bring in $200 million in gambling revenue over a full year.\nThe 2011 law legalizing casino gambling in Massachusetts allowed for just one slots parlor in the state along with three regional resort casinos.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:01:47.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
