I don't know who I have to talk about this, but I will find a way because it is not okay. \n\"On my first day I didn't want to have a call with someone with the FA, but for sure this is not okay. \n\"These young players are our future. If we handle them like horses we get horses.\" \nKlopp embraces a high-energy, pressing game - his Liverpool side ran a combined 116 kilometres against Tottenham - but he insisted this tactic does not involve overworking his players. \n\"The biggest misunderstanding in my life is people ask me if it is possible to play this kind of football,\" he added. \n\"We don't have to run 115km only to be successful. We need healthy players, but we don't kill the players. You don't have to run like crazy if you have the ball. It is only the start. \n\"We must know [to] turn the screws in the right moment - better thinking, better timing. But if [you] play a much better team and you are not ready to run more than them then you are crazy.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T10:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:55:52.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
