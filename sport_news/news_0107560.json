See more sports photos at www.fnpinfocus.com. \nURBANA — There is not much mystery to what Urbana is doing on offense these days. \nThe Hawks are running the read-option on just about every play. The ball is snapped to sophomore Gage Dickens, who was a running back on the junior varsity team not long ago, and he either hands the ball off to junior Elijah Atkins or keeps it himself, often on a straight-ahead run. \nThat’s the formula for how the Hawks are moving the ball. Yet, somehow, they are making it work. \nMidway through the fourth quarter Friday, Dickens saw the middle of his offensive line open up a big hole and he darted right through it for the game-winning touchdown in a 14-10 home win over Middletown. \n“My line did an amazing job tonight,” said Dickens, who finished with 155 yards on 26 carries. “It was a read-option. I saw the hole, and I took it.” \nAtkins, who had 138 yards on 27 carries, including a 40-yard touchdown run near the end of the third quarter, watched Dickens dart into the end zone with 7 minutes, 31 seconds left in the fourth quarter and thought, “Oh my God, he’s only a sophomore.” \nWith its third win in four games, Urbana evened its record at 4-4, providing a fitting sendoff for the 23 seniors who were playing in their final home game. \n“Walking around school, people would be like, ‘Hey, man, what’s your record?’” said Parker Mellott, one of the seniors and a team leader. \nMellott’s face would basically drop as he shot back: 1-3 or 2-4. But now it’s a different story. \n“Back to 4-4,” he said. “We’ll take that. That’s good stuff.” \nThe Hawks kept hope alive for a winning season by rallying from a 10-point deficit over the final 20 minutes. \nIn a game featuring two tough defenses, offensive opportunities figured to be few and far between, and they largely were. \nMiddletown (4-4) grabbed its lead on a 33-yard field goal by K.J. Bromwell in the second quarter and a 40-yard touchdown run by sophomore quarterback Matt Evich that, much like Dickens’ game-winner, involved him taking the snap and bursting right up the middle virtually untouched. \nBut Urbana answered right back, as Atkins took the handoff from Dickens on a sweep to the right and found enough room near the sideline to run away from the defense on a 40-yard touchdown of his own. \n“So resilient,” Urbana coach Dave Mencarini said. “These kids find ways to continue to fight and compete.” \nThe defensive battle resumed with Middletown snuffing out what looked to be a promising drive for Urbana on the Knights’ 25-yard line. On fourth-and-2 from the 21, Atkins was dragged down from behind by junior Matthew Pritts for a 4-yard loss. The ball went over on downs with 1:15 left in the third quarter. \nBut the game turned in Urbana’s favor on the ensuing Middletown possession. On third-and-22 from the Knights’ 37, Evich’s pass was intercepted by Ja’Ren Kenyatta and returned to the 42. That set the stage for Dickens and the game-winning drive. \n“We gutted one out and found a way to win, just like last week [against Tuscarora],” Mellott said. \nMidway through the season, Urbana completely overhauled its offense, which is hardly a simple undertaking. \nWith a young quarterback and young receivers, they needed to simplify their attack and just find a way to get the ball in the hands of their best players, Mencarini said. \nThat meant pretty much shelving the passing game — the Hawks attempted just five passes against Middletown and one was intercepted — and allowing Dickens and Atkins to take off on running plays. \nAtkins was a receiver for Urbana last season, while Dickens was a JV player. So, there was a pretty steep learning curve for both as they learned to read blocks and find the openings on the line. \n“Once I got used to it, it’s just football, baby,” Atkins said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T14:10:50.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
