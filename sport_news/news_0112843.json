One of the biggest youth sailing events in the state took place right in Holland this weekend with the USA Junior Olympic Sailing Festival Michigan Championship at the Macatawa Bay Yacht Club. Several local racers took to the waters and battled the high winds on a breezy, but sunny day, with several finding themselves finishing near the top of the standings in three different categories. The team of Cole Cheney/Charlie Sligh from the Macatawa Bay Yacht Club had the highest finish of any local racers, taking third in the 420 high school division with 33 points. “It was pretty windy out there. We flipped a few times, but it was a good time,” Cheney said. “I’ve been doing this ever since I was a little kid. My dad is a big sailor and I just got into it. The best part is just sailing with a friend and just trying to do the best you can.” Other local finishers in the 420 class included Saugatuck Yacht Club’s Victoria Compton/Morgan Hubbard in sixth (48), Zachary Beyer/Max Ralston of Macatawa Bay Yacht Club in eighth (69) and fellow Macatawa Bay member Grayson Kanis in 15th (100). In the optimist class, Saugatuck Yacht Club’s Owen Bannasch placed eighth (72), while Macatawa Bay members Quentin Beyer and Eden Nykamp tied for 14th (106), LJ Nykamp finished 22nd (180) and Caitlin Derby placed 30th (226). “I like the racing aspect of it — just the fun, high-adrenaline part of it,” Nykamp said. “I like the people you get to meet. You see a lot of the same people at all of the regattas.” “I’ve been sailing for six years and my dad grew up sailing, so he got me into it,” Derby said. “This is my fourth Junior Olympics and it’s really fun.” In the laser radial class, Macatawa Bay’s Jack Hemmeigarn tied for fourth (29) to round out the local competitors. “I was really proud of the Optimist kids because we’ve been training really hard all summer. It really showed because our team was one of the few team that still had all of their students still racing out there today,” Macatawa Bay Yacht Club Coach & Interim Sailing Director Lexi Petter said. “For a regatta, you usually want to go practice the week before for a few hours each day. — Follow this reporter on Twitter @GregBuckner By Greg.Buckner", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:40:45.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
