But replays showed it was linebacker Lawrence Timmons, not Mitchell, who made the hit that injured Smith.\n“I got speared in my back by an ex-teammate,” Smith, who was a teammate of Mitchell’s on the Panthers in 2013, told reporters after the game.\n“I kinda know his character and who he is. After he hit me, he said, ‘How do you like that?'”\nMitchell had tackled Smith earlier in the game, but that was an uneventful 5-yard play.\nThe Ravens rallied to win the game 23-20 in overtime for their first win of the season, but that appeared to be of little consolation to the feisty veteran.\n“The best thing I could do without threatening him and saying, ‘I will assault him when I see him’ is I will say, ‘I look forward to playing him again, and he’s on my lifetime hit list,'” said Smith, whose Ravens play the Steelers in Week 16 on Dec. 27.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under baltimore ravens ,  nfl ,  pittsburgh steelers ,  steve smith", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T12:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:35:03.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
