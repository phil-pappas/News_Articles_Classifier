The Indians battled hard in the opening set but seemed lifeless in the second set in the 25-18, 25-11 loss. It was the night of Volley For The Cure at PTHS and the crowd was a little larger than usual. Homecoming Week is also taking place, which might have limited the usual number of raucous students in the stands. There was a little electricity being generated early in the first set as Ashley Harfst opened the match with an ace. Eureka put the ball in the net on the second play and PTHS led 2-0. Grace Watson got a service point after Meghan Heller registered a kill to make it 4-1. But then the serves started to miss. Pontiac put the ball into the net three times, wide once and long once during a run of five serves. “We missed five in the first game; second game, I don’t think we missed any but our confidence was shot,” Smithson said if her team’s serving. Compounding the serving issue was the Eureka offense. Between 6-footer Lauren Rokey and 5-11 freshman Hailey Flowers, the Hornets were stinging the Pontiac defense. The Indians lost their three-point lead but managed to stay even until serve receive became a bit of a problem. An ace serve for Eureka tied the first set at 5-5. There were four more ties and three lead changes over the next nine plays. Heller had a kill and a block as the Tribe stayed within two points — 13-11 after the block — but the Hornets were progressively pulling away. It was the hitting power of Eureka that was the problem for Pontiac Rokey finished with 10 kills on the night and Flowers contributed 9. “We knew we had to adjust to Lauren Rokey. We worked on blocks in practice and we were up and ready to go the first game; we just lost it the second,” Smithson said. The good thing about the second game for Pontiac was the serving, at least in that each one was put into play. The unfortunate thing was the way Eureka played those serves, along with many of the returns made by the Tribe. Two ties and two lead changes highlighted the first seven plays of the second set. Eureka got rolling behind the swinging of Rokey and Flowers, pushing a 4-3 lead to a 13-5 advantage. Pontiac simply did not look to be in the mood over the final stages of the match. Could it have been because of the distractions taking place? Smithson was not accepting that as an excuse. Page 2 of 2 - “Throw in Homecoming and Volley For The Cure, which is a great cause, it’s been chaotic, but we should have been more ready to go that second game,” she said. Heller finished 4 kills for the Indians. Wright added 2 and Harfst had 9 assists. Harfst also had 6 service points on offense and 8 digs on defense. Miranda Fitzsimmons also had 8 digs. The varsity win completed a sweep for the Hornets. Eureka took the sophomore match 25-9, 25-18 and the freshman match 25-12, 29-27.
