The Cougars under first-year coach Tom Herman continued their steady climb through the rankings to No. 18 (from 21), following a 59-10 crushing of Central Florida on Saturday. The Cougars close out the regular season with four of five games at home, in a bid to go undefeated. Plenty of observers figured Herman, who last served as a whiz offensive coordinator at national champ Ohio State, would get UH headed in the right direction. Few figured it would be this quick.

By Saturday night A&M fans were simply kicking themselves for being duped by a faux contender in the SEC West.\nThe Aggies dropped out of the Associated Press top 25 poll on Sunday, following their second consecutive double-digit loss, this one more stunning than the previous. Mississippi whipped the Aggies 23-3 in Oxford, Miss., following A&M's 41-23 home loss to Alabama the week prior.\nThe Aggies also are left with a load of quarterback questions, after starter Kyle Allen was grossly ineffective over the first three quarters, and coach Kevin Sumlin replaced him with junior-college transfer Jake Hubenak, not touted freshman Kyler Murray.\nSumlin said the decision to skip over Murray was based on the prior week of practice. It should be an interesting coming week around the Coolidge practice fields, based on the drama enveloping the two-game losing streak.\nCOMING THIS WEEK\nWest Virginia at TCU, 6:30 p.m. Thursday\nLouisiana Tech at Rice, 7 p.m. Friday\nSouth Carolina at Texas A&M, 11 a.m. Saturday\nCollege of Faith at Texas Southern, 1 p.m. Saturday\nArkansas-Pine Bluff at Prairie View A&M, 1 p.m. Saturday\nLamar at Houston Baptist, 2 p.m. Saturday\nTexas at Iowa State, 6 p.m. Saturday\nTexas A&M-Commerce at Sam Houston State, 6 p.m. Saturday\nVanderbilt at Houston, 6 p.m. Saturday\nFlorida vs. Georgia (Jacksonville, Fla.), 2:30 p.m. Saturday\nOklahoma State at Texas Tech, 2:30 p.m. Saturday\nNotre Dame at Temple, 7 p.m. Saturday", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/52/8850072/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/52/8850075/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/52/8850061/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/52/8850074/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/52/8850078/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/52/8850073/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/52/8850049/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/52/8850073/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/52/8850053/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/52/8850049/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/52/8850052/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/52/8850052/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/52/8850061/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/52/8850060/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/52/8850074/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/51/8850046/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/51/8850042/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/51/8850045/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/52/8850060/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/52/8850053/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/51/8850045/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/52/8850075/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/51/8850042/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/52/8850072/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/52/8850078/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/51/8850046/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-26T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:13:42.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
