Referees Frederik L'Ecuyer and Dan O'Rourke looked at the replay by the penalty box at Air Canada Centre and determined Plekanec made incidental contact with Bernier. \nChallenges are new to the NHL this season and can be made on goals involving goalie interference or offside plays. \nBecause he won the challenge, Babcock would be able to challenge another play later in the game. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:35:22.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
