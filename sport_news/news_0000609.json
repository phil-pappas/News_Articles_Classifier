The auction was held jointly by Stack's Bowers and Sotheby's on Wednesday. The 105-coin sale was the second of five auctions of federal coinage from the D. Brent Pogue Collection. Among the stars of the sale was a 1794 Flowing Hair Silver Dollar, known as the Lord Saint Oswald specimen. It sold for nearly $5 million, in line with its high presale estimate. Another highlight was a 1795 Capped Bust Right Eagle, also known as the Garrett Eagle. The $10 gold piece sold for $2.5 million, setting a new record for any pre-Gold Rush United States gold coin sold at public auction.
