I'm only doing it because this is the way it's always been done.\nWell ... I've just damaged my career, according to TalentSmart cofounder Travis Bradberry .\nThe psychologist, author and management consultant wrote in a LinkedIn posting that using certain phrases in the office \"instantly change the way people see you and can forever cast you in a negative light.\"\nYour boss and coworkers probably won't consciously think less of you when you say these phrases, but raises, promotions and invitations to lunch might not be as forthcoming as you think they should be, The Independent wrote in an analysis of Bradberry's work. So here are the Top 5 phrases to avoid saying at the office at all costs:\nIt's not fair.\nNo kidding. Get used to it -- and stop complaining about the obvious to everyone else. Saying something isn't fair makes you seem \"immature and na√Øve,\" Bradberry wrote.\nThis is the way it's always been done.\nAh, yes, the clarion call of the innovator. Declaring that something should be done a certain way because it's always been done that way \"not only makes you sound lazy and resistant to change, but it could make your boss wonder why you haven't tried to improve things on your own,\" The Independent writes.\nNo problem.\nThis phrase apparently gives the impression that you don't want to do whatever it is you've just agreed to do. Bradberry recommends using actual positive language, such as: \"I'll be happy to take care of that.\"\nThis may be a silly idea/I'm going to ask a stupid question.\nWhen you start with one of these phrases, you sound weak and unsure of yourself. Donald Trump would fire you in a second. Managers sometimes say there are no stupid questions, but they secretly know there are. Don't put the thought in their head. Ask questions or float ideas from a place of strength: get across that you're gathering more information or brainstorming while well on your way to solving whatever problem is at hand.\nThis will only take a minute.\nWhat's wrong with that? After all, we're all supposed to be fast and nimble workers these days. The Independent says that \"unless you're literally going to complete the task in 60 seconds,\" saying this makes you appear less competent, like someone who rushes through tasks.\nThere, I'm done with the article. That wasn't so bad after all. And it only took a minute. Oops . Actually, it took ... a while . But not too long. Or something.\nRidding yourself of bad workplace phrases is harder than it appears. If you found the above advice useful, be aware that Bradberry isn't done.
