(Nhat V. Meyer/Bay Area News Group) (Nhat V. Meyer) SpartanCentral blog San Jose State heads to the mouth of the beast Saturday, except it's a mouth with cavities, canker sores and gum recession. \nAuburn's unexpected struggles -- the Tigers were taken to overtime by Jacksonville State -- have seemingly created a flicker of hope for the Spartans (2-2), who are 20-point underdogs. \nThey won't acknowledge seeing any weakness in Auburn (2-2) and, smartly, are expecting to see the traditional SEC power at its best in front of a rowdy homecoming crowd in Jordan-Hare Stadium. \n\"It's a different world down there,\" SJSU defensive tackle Tony Popovich said. \"But we can't focus on Auburn. We have to worry about ourselves. We know that this time.\" \nLast year, the Spartans were competitive for all of 18 minutes, before crumbling into a 59-13 loss. \nStretching the drama to a full 60 minutes means executing the basics, of course: Limiting turnovers and driving-killing penalties, and avoiding gaffes on special teams. \nBut that's only the start of the to-do list for SJSU. \nCoordinators Al Borges (offense) and Greg Robinson (defense) offered up a check-list of their own: \nBall control. \nBorges cited this, not quarterback play, as the priority for his unit — and the numbers support his case. \nThe Spartans average 33.5 first downs per game in their two wins and only 13.5 in their two losses. Advertisement \nDominating time-of-possession doesn't always equate to victory, but success in this area would keep Auburn's offense off the field and allow the SJSU defense to rest. \nFirst-down defense. \n\"We have to get ahead in the downs,\" Robinson said. \"That's the best way to limit their running game.\" \nThe Spartans' prospects would brighten considerably if they force Auburn into passing situations. The Tigers average 6.6 yards per pass attempt, 89th in the nation. \nWhat's more, quarterbacks Jeremy Johnson and Sean White complete just 42 percent of their passes on third down. \nSteady QB play. \nDeeply connected to ball control, this is the obvious area of concern for the Spartans. \nWhether starter Kenny Potter is healthy or Joe Gray makes his second consecutive start -- the smart money is on Gray -- the Spartans need consistency. \nBig plays would be welcome, of course, but the key is mistake-free execution with a high completion percentage. \nIn other words: Exactly the performance Gray delivered against Fresno State (20 of 23, three touchdowns, no interceptions) but against a better team under far tougher circumstances. \n\"It's making the right read, the right decision, in a hostile environment,\" Borges said. \"It's the ultimate test.\" \nContaining the wideouts. \nAuburn has speed on the perimeter, but turning that speed into big plays has been an issue: In four games, they have just two receptions longer than 25 yards. \nSJSU must not only avoid getting beat deep, it must tackle soundly after the catch and force the Tigers to move the ball five yards at a time for 70 or 80 yards. \nThe running game. \nThe Spartans churned for 291 yards against Fresno State, but don't expect a repeat — not even against a porous Auburn defense. \nEven four yards per carry on first down would make the situation more manageable. \nThere are far more pages of the playbook available on second-and-six (or less) than second-and-seven (or more). \n\"We just need normal down-and-distance,\" Borges said. \"What does that mean? I don't know. It depends on the situation. I don't keep a goal chart, except to win.\" For more on college sports, see Jon Wilner's College Hotline at blogs.mercurynews.com/collegesports .
