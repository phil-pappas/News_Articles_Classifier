However, the first-year Traip Academy field hockey coach never felt more excited than she did after her No. 8 Rangers upset second-seeded St. Dom’s, 3-2, on Wednesday in a Class C South quarterfinal game. Traip junior Amelia Sullivan scored the game-winning goal in the third set of penalty corners after the first two 8-minute overtime sessions didn’t produce a winner. “It was so amazing to watch the girls go out there and fight and win this game,” Cribby said. “I’ve been a part of many sports teams over the years and I can’t remember winning a game like this this and having so much excitement. It was amazing.” Traip (9-6) will now face No. 3 Oak Hill in a semifinal game on Saturday. Oak Hill advanced thanks to a 1-0 win over No. 6 Sacopee Valley. “We’re definitely hungry for more,” Cribby said. “This was the first step and we have another big game on Saturday; that’s where our focus is. We can’t rest on this one. We have to move on.” The Rangers sent the game into overtime with no time left in regulation as freshman Madison Andrews scored on a penalty corner, off an assist from Mia Perez, another freshman, after time had expired. “It was crazy,” Cribby said. “We’ve been talking and working all week about needing to finish. I am so proud of these girls. They worked hard on cleaning everything up and polishing up our game. They found some heart and drive and get over some adversity. I am so proud of them. It was such a hard-earned win for us.” St. Dom’s took an early 1-0 lead and that held up until Traip’s Jess Segura tied the game at 1-1 with just over 3 minutes left in regulation. St. Dom’s stormed right back and scored in the next minute, reclaiming a one-goal lead before Andrews’ late-game heroics. “The girls gave everything they had,” Cribby said. “I was confident in their ability to go out and do it (win) if they wanted to, and they did.” Traip goalie Taylor Kashmer had 10 saves. “She came up with some big saves for us,” Cribby said. “They had some scary shots there late in regulation and in overtime and she had some diving saves for us. She’s been consistent for us throughout the season and she kept us in the game.” Cribby also praised the defensive effort of Rachel Potter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:43:50.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
