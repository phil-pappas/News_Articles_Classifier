What you see is not always what you end up getting. In October, reality begins to set in around the country.\nGeorgia and Southern California will probably not contend for the College Football Playoff.\nFlorida and Utah probably will.\nStill skeptical about the Gators and Utes? That's OK. There is still plenty of time for each to collapse. You might not be high on what they will do, but it is getting harder to argue with what they have done.\nThis week's AP Top 25 Heat Check is about judging where teams are more than where they might be going (Next game is Saturday unless otherwise noted).\nNo. 1 Ohio State\nIs it too much to ask Ohio State to put a Baylor-style beat down on a Maryland team that was about to have its coach fired?\nNext: Penn State.\nHeat check: Too hot.\nNo. 2 Baylor\nWe probably won't get a good read on the Bears until November, when they face one of the toughest closing schedules in the country. But to be fair, if we are going to hold it against Ohio State for not blowing out underwhelming opposition, shouldn't Baylor get some credit for doing just that?\nNext: West Virginia.\nHeat check: Too hot. The Bears are good. Their resume is not.\nNo. 3 TCU\nWhat the Horned Frogs lack in defense they have been making up with resiliency (and offense). Two come-from-behind road wins should not be taken lightly.\nNext: at Iowa State.\nHeat check: Just right.\nNo. 4 Utah\nStock up: Michigan win. Stock down: Oregon win. Seems as if voters are uncomfortable making the Utes No. 1 because they don't think they will stay there. Heat check doesn't think they will either, but is willing to deal with that later.\nNext: Arizona State.\nHeat check: Too cold.\nNo. 5 Clemson\nRIP, Clemsoning - and maybe the next person who asks Tigers coach Dabo Swinney about Clemsoning.\nNext: Boston College.\nHeat check: Too cold.\nNo. 6 LSU\nStatement time for the Tigers, who have yet to beat a really good team.\nNext: No. 8 Florida.\nHeat check: Too hot.\nNo. 7 Michigan State\nRight now the Spartans are mediocre on offense and defense - and still unbeaten with a chance to prove their problems are overblown.\nNext: at No. 12 Michigan.\nHeat check: Too hot.\nNo. 8 Florida\nA decisive road win against Missouri was almost as impressive as blowing out Ole Miss at home. The Gators should be the highest-ranked team in the SEC.\nNext: at No. 6 LSU.\nHeat check: Too cold.\nNo. 9 Texas A&M\nThe Aggies got a week off to prepare for their next opportunity to score a big win.\nNext: No. 10 Alabama.\nHeat check: Too cold.\nNo. 10 Alabama\nThe resume is taking a beating because the teams the Tide has beaten haven't done much before or after playing Alabama. So for now, have to honor the results of that head-to-head matchup with Ole Miss. But maybe not for much longer.\nNext: at No. 9 Texas A&M.\nHeat check: Too hot.\nNo. 11 Florida State\nRB Dalvin Cook seems determined to give Heisman Trophy voters an alternative to LSU's Leonard Fournette.\nNext: Louisville.\nHeat check: Just right.\nNo. 12 Michigan\nThe Wolverines have a seven-point road loss to a team that hasn't lost yet and have crushed everyone else in their path since. You could make a case for them as the best team in the Big Ten.\nNext: No. 7 Michigan State.\nHeat check: Too cold. Put the Wolverines right behind the Spartans. Maybe even ahead.\nNo. 13 Mississippi\nSince Ole Miss beat Alabama, the Tide has been better than the Rebels. But when it counted most, Ole Miss was better than the Tide and so the Rebels should be ranked higher.\nNext: at Memphis.\nHeat check: Too cold.\nNo. 14 Notre Dame\nThe Irish are a bunch of turnovers in Death Valley from making a case to be No. 1.\nNext: USC.\nHeat check: Just right.\nNo. 15 Stanford\nBeating the Trojans in the Coliseum is not as cool as it used to be.\nNext: No. 18 UCLA, Thursday.\nHeat check. Touch too hot.\nNo. 16 Oklahoma State\nThe Cowboys could have easily lost each of their last three games - but they did not.\nNext: Kansas.\nHeat check: Just right.\nNo. 17 Iowa\nThe best team in the Big Ten West is probably not the 17th best team in the country.\nNext: No. 20 Northwestern.\nHeat check: Too hot.\nNo. 18 UCLA\nThe Bruins can make that loss to Arizona State seem like an aberration by breaking a seven-game losing streak to Stanford.\nNext: at No. 15 Stanford, Thursday.\nHeat check: Tad too hot.\nNo. 19 Oklahoma\nHeat check was high on the Sooners and got burned.\nNext: at Kansas State.\nHeat check: Too hot.\nNo. 20 Northwestern\nThe Wildcats still have that nice win against Stanford, which for at least one more week should put them ahead of the Cardinal.\nNext: at No. 17 Iowa.\nHeat check: Too cold\nNo. 21 Boise State\nThe Broncos are a Tanner Mangum miracle from being undefeated and maybe ranked in the top 10.\nNext: at Utah State, Friday in by far Boise State's toughest remaining game.\nHeat check: Too cold.\nNo. 22 Toledo\nThe Rockets are into a comfortable part of the schedule before a difficult stretch run against MAC contenders. They have won their first two MAC games 62-17. Good sign for a team hoping to squeeze into a New Year's Six game.\nNext: Eastern Michigan.\nHeat check: Just right.\nNo. 23 California\nThe loss at Utah was disappointing for the Bears, but not necessarily discouraging to their outlook. Cal looks like it should be able to hang against a schedule that is about to get really tough. And those road wins against Texas and Washington are looking better.\nNext: No. 18 UCLA, Oct. 22.\nHeat check: Too cold.\nNo. 24 Houston\nThe undefeated Cougars are getting some love from poll voters, but you could make the case that Temple and Memphis have better resumes out of the American Athletic Conference.\nNext: at Tulane, Friday.\nHeat check: Too hot.\nNo. 25 Duke\nThe competition to be the third-best team in the ACC might not be pretty. How about another AAC team here instead?\nNext: at Virginia Tech, Oct. 24.\nHeat check: Too hot.\n___\nFollow Ralph D.
