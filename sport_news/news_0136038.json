Part of that is a result of LSU stifling opponents' running games, with only 110 yards a contest on the ground per contest.\nBut right beneath the statistical surface, players are making the kind of big plays that disrupt opposing offenses and that has led to one vital fact: LSU has not trailed in a game this season.\nWho do you think the Tigers' defensive MVP has been through the first month of the season?\nVote in the poll and tell us why in the comment stream below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T15:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:03:13.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
