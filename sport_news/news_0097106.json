Sanjeev Sehgal, chairman of an industry association, said Indian firms were finding the terms and conditions of tenders for security equipment restrictive. The tenders require a firm to have prior experience, even though several Indian companies are fairly new. “Most of these conditions don’t support the domestic market. Sometimes the tender will require international certification such as the United Laboratories (UL) standard. If I am not supplying my products to the US, why should I obtain this certificate?” asked Sehgal. He said under the preferential market access (PMA), at least 30 per cent of the government’s requirement were reserved for the domestic sector. It is 100 per cent for CCTV and alarm systems and 50 per cent for biometric systems. “But these preferences are of no use if there is a restrictive tender,” he said. Sehgal’s company supplied video surveillance equipment to the Airports Authority of India (AAI), the Indian Army and the Indian Air Force (IAF). But two months ago, an AAI tender for CCTV cameras at the Ranchi airport listed a few companies, most of them foreign, from which certain parts of the system should be procured. There are also tenders for installing video surveillance at certain banks, which stipulated the need for UL certificates. MK Bhandari, the CEO of another security company, said the availability of raw material such as integrated circuits and microcontrollers was a major problem in India. “Due to this, Indian firms are not able to bid the lowest as our manufacturing cost is high. In more than 50 per cent of tenders, we face this problem,” said Bhandari. Ashok Atluri, head of a company making simulators for the armed forces, said when there was an indigenously designed and manufactured product, the government should discourage the import of a similar product. “Foreign firms are given preferences in their own country. Nevertheless, the current government is pro-Indian industry and there will be changes to encourage domestic companies to invest in R&D as also develop world-class products,” he hoped. Emails queries to the Ministries of Defence and Home Affairs elicited no response. Defence Ministry spokesperson Sitanshu Kar told The Tribune that the ministry would not respond to these allegations and required evidence to comment on it. A government official, on the condition of anonymity, said all procurements were transparent and ensured a level-playing field for all firms. “We will go for a company which can perform and has credibility. Even in the absence of past experience, there has to be some credibility. Some vendors win tenders but later cannot complete the work, like in integration projects,” said the official.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:17:04.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
