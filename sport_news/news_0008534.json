He said he felt his left hamstring grab while he was rounding second, and manager Joe Maddon said the rookie had a moderate strain. \n\"Addy right now will not participate in this next round,\" Maddon said Thursday. \"We’re not going to utilize him. Continue to work on him.\"\nMaddon said they haven’t made a decision on Russell’s replacement for the NLCS roster, which must be submitted by Saturday morning for the series against the Mets.\nReliever Jason Motte, who has been out with a right shoulder strain, is a possibility for this round, and Maddon said he likely will use four starters in the best-of-seven series.\nBaez, the second-year, pro hit a three-run homer in Chicago’s clinching win in Game 4. The 22-year-old slugger has big-time power, but he has struck out a lot during his brief time in the majors. \n\"Addison has played enough here this year to know that he belongs here and he can do this. I want to believe that Javy is arriving at that same point,\" Maddon said.\nAfter Lester pitches in the opener, Jake Arrieta will go in Game 2 on Sunday night. Lester is 6-5 with a 2.66 ERA in 15 postseason games, including 13 starts. \nArrieta threw a five-hit shutout in the wild card at Pittsburgh, but had his worst start in months when he allowed four runs in 5 2/3 innings in Game 3 against the Cards. Lester hasn’t pitched since the NLDS opener a week ago. \n\"It’s been a while since Jon’s been out there, so it’s good for him to get out there Game 1,\" Arrieta said, \"and I’ll be ready for Game 2.\" \nArrieta is up to 243 2/3 innings this year, easily passing his previous high of 156 2/3 innings from last year. He threw a side session Thursday and said he is fine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:48:25.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
