Even a nationally ranked opponent from the mighty Southeastern Conference.\nLynch threw for 384 yards and three touchdowns to lead Memphis over No. 13 Mississippi 37-24 in a convincing victory that showed the Tigers might just be the best team in the country that isn't in a Power Five conference.\nMemphis (6-0) has won 13 straight games dating to last season, which is the third longest streak in the nation. The victory was the first for the Tigers over a ranked opponent since 1996.\nOle Miss (5-2) jumped to a 14-0 lead less than six minutes into the game -- partly thanks to a 68-yard touchdown pass by receiver Laquon Treadwell on a trick play -- but Memphis responded with 31 unanswered points to take a 31-14 lead early in the third quarter.\n>> Got a question about Ohio State football? Ask the experts! \n\"We got down early, and there were a couple of long faces on the sideline, but we knew we had to keep plugging away,\" Lynch said. \"We knew early in the game we were moving the ball on them.\"\nThe rankings might say this game was an upset, but the Tigers didn't appear overmatched.\nThe Rebels were able to pull within 31-24 later in the third quarter but could get no closer. Treadwell caught a school-record 14 passes for 144 yards and a touchdown.\nThe 6-foot-7, 245-pound Lynch was superb, doing whatever he wanted against the Rebels' secondary. He completed 39 of 53 passes, helping the Tigers regroup following the rough start.\nIt helped that he had plenty of time to throw. When the game was over, jubilant fans poured onto the field to celebrate. Security guarded the goal posts and fans took selfies with players.\n>> Get the most out of your Ohio State experience, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \nLynch -- who else? -- was the main attraction.\n\"I got hit harder in that (postgame) pile than I did the whole game with all those fans smacking me on top of the head,\" Lynch said.\nAnthony Miller was Lynch's favorite target, catching 10 passes for 132 yards and a touchdown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:02:11.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
