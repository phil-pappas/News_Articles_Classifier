Neither team was able to make a move in the first quarter. However, the Generals offense started to break through late in the first quarter before capping it off with a run from the half yard line early in the second quarter. Two plays into the Wildcats next series, Josh Sailor raced 43 yards for a touchdown with 11:09 remaining. The extra point was good to give the Wildcats the lead. Defense helped the Wildcats set up the next score when they recovered a fumble at the Taft 26-yard line. Four plays later, Sailor ran 44 yards for the score with 5:10 remaining. Taft was not through scoring in the first half. With 13 seconds remaining, Jamil Iakopo found Robert Cozine for a 10-yard pass. It didn't take long for Sailor to make noise again thanks to a 31 yard touchdown run five plays into the opening series of the third quarter. This time though, Taft mixed the extra point. Sailor's next score came at the 6:29 mark of the quarter when on the first play of the Wildcat drive, Sailor ran 40 yards for the score. Taft's next score happened at the 9:29 mark of the fourth quarter with Donovan Watrous ran 34 yards for the score.
