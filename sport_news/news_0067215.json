But he returned to the football field for the first time since his freshman year and is the Raiders' leading receiver and tackler. Buy Now \nPeyton Lees was playing center field during an American Legion game. His next memory was hearing sounds but not being able to open his eyes to see what they were. \n“I heard doctors talking to me and I heard my mom's voice,” said Lees, a senior at Central A&M. “They asked if I knew where I was and I had no idea. I just figured something had happened at the game. I was really scared.” \nLees' mom, Kathy Gerhold, had watched her son's face collide with his teammates' shin as he dove for a ball. As Lees laid in center field, Gerhold kept expecting him to get up, thinking he was just angry he missed the ball. \n“I was yelling, 'Get up, get up,'” Gerhold said. \nBut Lees didn't move. The legion coaches and Gerhold rushed out to check on Lees, and when Gerhold approached her son, she saw his eyes were blackened, blood was pouring from his nose and there was a dent in his forehead. \n“I kept saying, 'What's wrong with his forehead?' and everyone was saying, 'No, it's just a broken nose,' but I was like, 'Uh-uh,'” Gerhold said. “I'm not one of those frantic moms that screams and cries. I was just in shock.” \nLees, who had regained consciousness, was rushed to the hospital, and when his dad, Mike Lees, arrived, his son said to him, with tears streaming down his broken face, \"Dad, I think I'm done with sports.\" Mike told him, \"Buddy, I just want you to be OK. I don't care if you play sports anymore. I just want you to be happy and healthy.\" \nBut Peyton doesn't give up easy. The baseball collision was the third in a string of injuries more serious than most athletes at any level will ever have. But nine months after facial reconstruction surgery, he was back on the baseball field. \nThen, this summer -- just over a year after being told he would never play football again -- he donned a helmet and pads for the first time since his freshman year. Tonight, he'll play his final game of what's been a record-setting senior season. \n“I thought I'd be done with sports forever,” Peyton said. “To get back out there … it means everything to me. It's pretty awesome to be out there again playing the best game in the world.” \nOn the field, Peyton was always undersized and overzealous. He suffered his first injury as an eighth-grader -- a concussion on a tackle by Arcola's Wyatt Fishel. \nBut his first serious injury came a year later – during his freshman year in a JV football game against Argenta-Oreana. Peyton was playing running back and as he was tackled to the ground and landed on by three defenders, the humerus bone in his right arm was fractured and the nerve that wraps around the bone was stretched. \nSurgery was performed on his arm, with a plate and 12 screws holding the bone together. Stretched nerves heal slowly. It was six months before he could straighten his fingers and a year before he had all the feeling back in his hand. \nBut Peyton still played baseball as a freshman, even making the varsity team – “A few fingers didn't work, but I was all right,” Peyton said. But right before regionals, during a particularly rough game of pickup basketball, he ran into the pole holding up the basket and broke his collarbone in half. \n“When I saw him, his friends had doctored him up, put him in a brace and they'd been to Taco Bell,” Gerhold said. “But then Coach (Mark) Ramsey saw him, took one look at it and said, 'You need to take him to the hospital. He has a broken collarbone.'” \nThat injury, which resulted in two surgeries, cost Peyton his sophomore season in football. But he was back for baseball in the spring, playing for A&M, then the Decatur Pride American Legion team in the summer. \nEarly in that legion baseball season, June 7, the team was playing in Paris. Peyton called \"I got it\" on a ball hit to left center, but left fielder Dylan Ground didn't hear him. Peyton dove and, as Ground attempted to jump over him, Peyton's face smashed into Ground's shin. \nPeyton was rushed to Paris Community Hospital. Doctors there recommended airlifting him to Carle Foundation Hospital in Champaign. But with storms in the forecast, he went by ambulance instead. Gerhold rode with him. \n“It took a little over an hour to get there and it was the worst ride ever,” Gerhold said. “He started throwing up blood everywhere. At one point they were telling the driver to turn the lights on and hurry up. I think it was because his blood pressure and everything started to drop, but they got him stabilized.” \nAt the hospital, X-rays revealed fractured bones in his forehead, cheek, nose, jaw and both orbital sockets, and also broken teeth. Dr. Jonathon Bailey led a team of doctors who needed photos of Peyton to reconstruct his facial features as close as possible to what it looked like before the collision. \n“It was scary – I didn't know what to expect as far as how he would look afterwards,” Gerhold said. “But I trusted the doctors.” \nAn incision along his hairline from ear to ear was made to expose the fractures, and surgeons also went in through his eye, mouth and nose to repair the breaks using mesh, plates and screws. The lining of his sinuses had to be scraped out. \n\"Basically they had to cut his head open and take his face off so they could fix everything from the inside out,\" Mike said. \"When his mom and I heard that ... I was a total mess over it and she was, too.\" \nIt was five days after the collision before Peyton could even partially open his eyes and he was in the hospital for seven days. The recovery was slow and painful -- it took six months for the swelling to completely subside. \nBut the results were, for the most part, positive. He has a dime-size indent on the left side of his forehead, his sense of smell is gone and things don't quite taste the same. But other than occasional headaches, he's pain free. \n\"And he's still as handsome as ever,\" said Gerhold, who has before and after X-ray photos of Peyton on her phone and points out the plates securing her son's face bear a strong resemblance to the crucifix. \nAround a month after surgery, Peyton was outside playing catch and began to realize he still wanted to play baseball. Soon he was lobbying to get back in the batting cage. He had to wear a mask when he batted, but was on the field for his junior season of baseball. \n\"It amazed the hell out of me,\" Mike said. \nPeyton said he was initially cautious when he returned to the field, but that didn't last long. \n“I forget things like that fast,” he said. \nMidway through the summer before his senior year, Peyton was throwing the football around with a friend at the lake who was marveling at the way Peyton could catch the ball. \n“After that, I started thinking about playing football,” Peyton said. “I definitely missed it.” \nThe next day, he broached the subject with both his mom and dad. \n\"I said, 'Buddy, I'll see what we can do,'\" Mike said. \"Honestly, I thought the doctor would say no.\" \n“I kind of blew him off,” Gerhold said. “I thought the doctor would never let him play anyway, so I wasn't really concerned about it.” \nBut Peyton made sure the subject wasn't dismissed. At his school physical, the doctor told him he'd need permission from the surgeon – Bailey – to play. Bailey was on vacation, but his office performed a CAT scan and sent them to Bailey, who read the results. \nHis response shocked Peyton's mom and dad. \n\"He said, 'Buy the best helmet money can buy and he'll be fine,'\" Mike said. \"I was immediately worried -- I'm a football guy, but I don't like to see my kid get hurt. \n\"But to see the joy on his face when the doctor said yes, then again when he went to work out with the team and the kids all greeted him ... he was just so happy.\" \nGerhold said as much as she wanted to tell her son he couldn't play, she also felt he deserved the chance after what he'd already been through. \n“It makes me nervous, but I can't tie him to a chair and keep him down,” said Gerhold, who wears a custom T-shirt to games that reads, “Blessed to get a second chance. Make it count.” “The thing with Peyton is, this hasn't fazed him a bit. If he does something, he has to do it as fast as he can and as hard as he can. He doesn't do anything mild. I just have to grit my teeth and pray that nothing happens.” \nThat night, Peyton played in a 7-on-7 -- his first football activity since he was a freshman. Mike insisted his son switch positions from running back to receiver to avoid contact on every play, and it turned out to be the perfect fit. Immediately, A&M coach Brent Weakly knew he'd be an impact player. \n“Right when we started throwing the ball around, I knew we had something pretty good,” Weakly said. “Then at the 7-on-7 there weren't many people who could cover him, so then I knew we had something really good.” \nA&M's first game of the season was at Milford. Mike and his dad made the two-hour trip and watched as Peyton scored on a 14-yard touchdown reception early in the second quarter. \n\"I never thought he'd play again, let alone score a touchdown,\" Mike said. \"It was a fade pattern, and when he caught that ball, I jumped on my dad's shoulders and just started crying.\" \nBut there have also been scary moments. In A&M's third game of the season, against St. Teresa, the Bulldogs' physical freshman running back Jacardia Wright caught Peyton out with a knee to the helmet as Peyton tried to bring him down, leaving Peyton on the ground motionless. \nBut after passing the concussion test, he was back in the game on the next play and made a tackle. \n\"My first thought was, 'Oh Lord, not again,'\" Mike said. \"But then he got up and got back in there. He's just a tough kid.\" \nIn his only season playing varsity football, Peyton has set A&M's single-season record for receiving yards in a game (159) and regular-season receptions (34), and has also been among the team's top tacklers. \n“At first I was nervous about how I'd play because I hadn't played in a few years,” Peyton said. “But once I learned my position, I knew I could benefit the team.” \nPeyton said he doubts he'll play in college -- “With the injuries … that's another level there. The kids are a lot bigger,” Peyton said -- so tonight will be his last time in a football uniform. \n“It's going to be bittersweet,” Gerhold said, fighting back tears. “I'm so happy he gets to play. It's sad, but for him to get to play again was amazing.” \n“It's going to be a tough one,” Mike said. “He's overcame so much at such a young age. He's just a fighter.” \njconn@herald-review.com|(217) 421-7971", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:31:28.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
