But I just didn't think about it.\" \nThe outcome breathed new life into a Kingsway team in need of a win after starting the season 1-3. The three losses were to quality teams - all ranked in the top 15 by The Inquirer. \n\"But we needed this game, big-time,\" Barchuk said. \"The experience we had in those [losses] taught us to never say die. And that's what happened tonight.\" \nIt took a heroic final drive to even give Sandy the opportunity at the winning kick. \nThe Dragons had been held without a first down in the second half until the drive, which started at the Kingsway 11 with 4 minutes, 10 seconds left. \nKnown for pounding the ball on the ground, the Dragons (2-3) deviated, and sophomore quarterback Peter Orio completed 4 of 5 passes in the drive for 60 yards. The biggest completion was a 37-yard strike to Shaune Oates that put Kingsway within striking distance. \n\"You just have to step up,\" Orio said. \"I know we don't throw the ball very much. But when we do, I have to be ready. \n\"Our motto this year has been to finish strong, we just hadn't been doing it - but something happened tonight. We woke up.\" \nKingsway's offense had trouble moving the ball most of the game outside of a 39-yard touchdown run by Sean Samuels in the first quarter and a 75-yard score up the middle by Anthony Seas in the second quarter. \nBut the Dragons stayed in the game thanks to a gutsy defensive effort against a high-powered offense. Township quarterback Mike Piperno threw for 144 yards and three touchdowns. But Kingsway forced four turnovers, including a pick by Hanif Jamal on the Minutemen's only offensive play after Sandy's field goal. \n\"Washington Township is a terrific team,\" Barchuk said. \"But our defense has played well all season - and they did again tonight.\" \nWashington Twp. 7 7 0 0 - 20 \nKingsway 6 13 0 3 - 22 \nK: Sean Samuel 39 run (kick failed) \nWT: Nick Grosso 7 pass from Mike Piperno (Cooper Bentz kick) \nK: Anthony Seas 75 run (pass failed) \nK: Samuel 1 run (Sean Sandy kick) \nWT: Justin Ortiz 16 pass from Piperno (Bentz kick) \nWT: Ortiz 22 pass from Piperno (pass failed) \nK: Sean Sandy 33 field goal", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:16:09.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
