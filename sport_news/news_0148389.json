One suspects it can’t be entirely true. After all, who would travel from Bangalore to Dharamsala just to sell a bagful of items, like tri-coloured wristbands, wigs, flags, whistles and India T-shirts, outside a cricket stadium? And when these two roadside hawkers from Bangalore tell you they have been travelling to different places hosting sports events and festivals to sell their stuff for the last 30 years, it becomes clear that their travelling is fuelled as much by the need to make a living as by their need to travel. “Our families tell us we are so lucky to have travelled so much, to have seen so many places,” says JP, opening up a bit after initial reticence. So you must have seen all the places in India? “Yes, we’ve been to almost every place, at least 25 times over,” he says, with a feigned air of indifference. As if on cue, his companion, Balu, takes over. “We were there when Michael Jackson came to Mumbai. The ticket for that event went for one lakh rupees,” he says, with an unmistakable sense of pride. They were, of course, somewhere outside the venue selling their stuff, but it’s still huge for them, and understandably the highlight of their excursions in the last three decades. So where do they go from here? “We will go wherever the team goes during the tour,” says JP. But isn’t it tough to keep up with the team that flies from one place to another several times within a few days? “Having been on the road for so long, we know the train network and timings almost by heart. The train is like a second home to us, so we arrive at our destinations well in time,” says Balu. So much travelling needs a lot of meticulous planning, and they don’t leave anything to chance. They’ve planned their travels up to the IPL next year after consulting India’s cricket schedule. “We go to some computer shop and get the fixtures printed. Advance planning is very important for us,” the duo says. Having visited almost every venue in the country, the duo naturally has an opinion on each of them. “Kochi is the best. It’s a huge ground and people come in celebratory mood, with bands and music, dressed up as different characters from the past. Good for our business.” “Over here, it’s a lot expensive, difficult to make money. Still, we are glad we came here and saw these beautiful mountains,” they say, the insatiable traveller in them pushing to the fore. Too many skippers cause confusion The jury is still out on whether the concept of multiple captains is working better than having just one leader across all formats. It may take a while to catalogue the positives, but at least one negative could be stated right away. South Africa have three skippers — Faf du Plessis in T20Is, AB de Villiers in ODIs and Hashim Amla in Tests — while India have two, MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli. Thus, some folks are definitely finding it tough to keep track of who’s leading in which format. As an evidence of the confusion so many skippers are causing, there were quite a few posters showing a Dhoni-Amla face-off on the way to the stadium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:06:56.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
