Carlos Gonzalez had an RBI single and winning pitcher Kyle Kendrick walked and scored as part of a five-run third inning when Colorado broke the game open. \nArenado homered off starter Chris Heston leading off the fourth, then added a two-run double in the third. That gave the Rockies slugger 88 extra-base hits, breaking Chipper Jones' single-season record set in 1999. \nKendrick (7-13) benefited from Arenado's big night to win for the third time since coming off the disabled list on Sept. 1. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:15:31.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
