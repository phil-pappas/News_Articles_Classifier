Right now, defense rules for the Wildcats.\nBecton is 3-1 after pitching a shutout against QP, and has allowed only 21 points in four games. That’s been more than enough to keep the Wildcats in the thick of the red-hot NJIC Meadowlands race, where five of the seven teams have three wins or more through four games.\n\"Our defense has anchored everything,\" said Becton coach Jack Maher. \"We’re putting pressure on the quarterback and closing gaps when we need to.\"\nThe undisputed heart of that defense is senior defensive end Alex Montalvo. He had 12 tackles, including two sacks and four tackles for loss, against Queen of Peace. That gives him 54 tackles, 5.5 sacks and 14 tackles for loss in four games.\nThe Wildcats also got a great effort Thursday night from sophomore linebacker Nico Failla, who had six tackles and an interception in his first varsity start.\nMaher said the defense has been buying time for a young offense to find its identity. He started three sophomores on the offensive line against QP in front of sophomore quarterback Mike Bolwell.\nSenior running back Gianni Failla had a big game behind the young blockers, carrying 23 times for a career-high 133 yards and his first three-touchdown game. Bolwell, a transfer from St. Joseph, is getting more comfortable in his role, and Maher believes the offense is on the verge of finding itself.\n\"We knew the offense would sputter a bit at the start,\" Maher said. \"But I’m optimistic. We’re improving every day, and we believe we can put it all together and explode.\"\nThe defense will face a tough challenge Friday night against Cresskill, No. 14 in The Record Public Top 20, and the Cougars’ top-shelf running game. That’s followed by games against Saddle Brook (3-1) and No. 20 Park Ridge.\n\"Any given Friday,\" Maher said. \"That should be the motto of our league. It’s going to be fun.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:45:28.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
