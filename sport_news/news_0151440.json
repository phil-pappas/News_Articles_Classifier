Reacting to criticism that it is targeting opponents of the Syrian government, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin admitted today that Russia’s airstrikes in Syria were targeting not only Islamic State militants but also other groups. Twenty airstrikes had destroyed a command center of Islamic State militants as well as ammunition depots, the defense ministry said. Moscow insisted that it was targeting IS militants while US officials and other cast doubt on the claim, saying the Russians appeared to be attacking opposition groups fighting Syrian government forces. Al-Mayadeen, a pro-Damascus television channel, said jets carried out at least 30 strikes against an insurgent alliance known as the Army of Conquest. The alliance includes the Nusra Front, Al-Qaida’s Syrian branch, but not Islamic State, which has declared a caliphate on swathes of Syria and Iraq. — Agencies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:24:54.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
