Story by Mike Kaszuba, photos and video by Aaron Lavinsky Star Tribune October 24, 2015 — 12:00PM BEFORE THE GAME Above, Mesabi Range players including, from left, Elvin Turner, Andre Bell and Kalil Grice, sat in the visiting team locker room moments before their season kicked off against Ridgewater in Willmar in late August. \nVIRGINIA, MINN. \nA ll the pregame strutting and smack talk meant nothing by halftime of the Mesabi Range College season opener. Mesabi, so confident and borderline brash before the game, found itself trailing Ridgewater 20-0 in Willmar. \nThere was near chaos in the visitor’s locker room. Montana Coates, the 6-3 center from Ohio with meaty arms and big tattoos, had to be pulled away from Terrence Allen, the lineman from Chicago with the 4-year-old son, as they argued over missed blocking assignments. The shouting, as usual, was laced with swearing. “Nobody blocking,” yelled Gary Vaughn, the wide receiver from Washington, D.C., who said he had recently been homeless. “I’m watching this s--- from the sideline. S--- looks stupid.” \nFinally the locker room quieted and Dan Lind, the team’s coach with a crew cut and an affinity for John Wayne, got to the point. “You guys talk a big game, right? ‘I got all this speed. I’m from Florida, Georgia, [Detroit], Chicago’— and you play like s---,” he said. “I told you, [these Minnesota] farm boys are going to kick you in the mouth.” Video 03:09 Players at Mesabi Range College hope to find their way to the next level of their football careers. Video (03:09): Players at Mesabi Range College hope to find their way to the next level of their football careers. \nIt was wake-up time for the Mesabi Range Norsemen, a two-year school on the outer fringe of American college football. \nOf the 44 players who sat for the Mesabi team picture in late August, almost all were from out of state, and only four were white. Seven players were from Florida, five from Illinois, four were from Georgia and 12 more were from South Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky. Most arrived on the Iron Range — the main campus is in Virginia, an economically depressed and overwhelmingly white city of 8,700 — having never before stepped foot in Minnesota. Few had cars, most struggled for money. Home was now three squat apartment buildings in back of the college with little in the way of furniture, food or fun. \nFor most of them, the 1,700-student school is a desperate, Hail Mary pass to playing football at a four-year school, and building a better future. Like other schools in the Minnesota College Athletic Conference, which has members stretching from Rochester to Bottineau, N.D., it is a last chance to find a college that would admit someone who barely graduated from high school yet still harbors big-time football dreams. \nThe roster included players such as Uriah English, an out-of-shape nose tackle from Louisville who scored a 14 on his ACT college entrance exam. “Grades killed me,” said English, known as “U-U” to his teammates. He found his way to Mesabi after a high school coach in Kentucky sent a tape to the school. “I wanted to wing it,” English said. “I’m liking it so far.” Aaron Lavinsky Tommy Washington III, left, and Alphonso Timmons looked out their windows to see what teammates were up to in the courtyard the night before their first game against Ridgewater. Aaron Lavinsky Terrence Allen Sr., of Chicago, stretched out his arms while standing to introduce himself at the beginning of an introduction to wellness course taught by head coach Dan Lind at Mesabi Range College during the first day of school in late August. Aaron Lavinsky Teammates Elvin Turner, left, laughed while talking about girls with Kalil Grice and Benjamin Allen in the library of Mesabi Range College. As part of work study, the three work as library aides during the school year. CAMPUS LIFE: Clockwise from top, two Mesabi players gaze from their campus apartment; Mesabi lineman Terrence Allen Sr. stretches as he introduces himself on the first day of classes; three teammates share a laugh in the school library. \nThough out-of-state tuition at Mesabi is only $3,250 a year, many of the players have a tough time making ends meet. Eric Taylor, an offensive lineman from Kentucky, arrived by bus and stopped at a family reunion in Chicago, where relatives gave him $400 so he had money when he came to Minnesota. Vaughn, the wide receiver, was ineligible for Mesabi’s first games because a college in North Carolina would not release his academic transcript until his mother took out a loan and paid a $1,800 bill. Allen mopped the bathrooms on a Friday night in the darkened school as part of a work-study job — and asked that no pictures be taken because he was embarrassed. \nGallery: Most members of the Mesabi Range College Norsemen football team had never stepped foot in Minnesota before arriving this summer. \nGallery: Most members of the Mesabi Range College Norsemen football team had never stepped foot in Minnesota before arriving this summer. \nGallery: Most members of the Mesabi Range College Norsemen football team had never stepped foot in Minnesota before arriving this summer. \nGallery: Most members of the Mesabi Range College Norsemen football team had never stepped foot in Minnesota before arriving this summer. \nGallery: Most members of the Mesabi Range College Norsemen football team had never stepped foot in Minnesota before arriving this summer. \nGallery: Most members of the Mesabi Range College Norsemen football team had never stepped foot in Minnesota before arriving this summer. \nGallery: Most members of the Mesabi Range College Norsemen football team had never stepped foot in Minnesota before arriving this summer. \nGallery: Most members of the Mesabi Range College Norsemen football team had never stepped foot in Minnesota before arriving this summer. \nGallery: Most members of the Mesabi Range College Norsemen football team had never stepped foot in Minnesota before arriving this summer. \nGallery: Most members of the Mesabi Range College Norsemen football team had never stepped foot in Minnesota before arriving this summer. \nGallery: Most members of the Mesabi Range College Norsemen football team had never stepped foot in Minnesota before arriving this summer. \nGallery: Most members of the Mesabi Range College Norsemen football team had never stepped foot in Minnesota before arriving this summer. \nGallery: Most members of the Mesabi Range College Norsemen football team had never stepped foot in Minnesota before arriving this summer. \nGallery: Most members of the Mesabi Range College Norsemen football team had never stepped foot in Minnesota before arriving this summer. \nGallery: Most members of the Mesabi Range College Norsemen football team had never stepped foot in Minnesota before arriving this summer. \nGallery: Most members of the Mesabi Range College Norsemen football team had never stepped foot in Minnesota before arriving this summer. \nGallery: Most members of the Mesabi Range College Norsemen football team had never stepped foot in Minnesota before arriving this summer. \nGallery: Most members of the Mesabi Range College Norsemen football team had never stepped foot in Minnesota before arriving this summer. \nGallery: Most members of the Mesabi Range College Norsemen football team had never stepped foot in Minnesota before arriving this summer. \nGallery: Most members of the Mesabi Range College Norsemen football team had never stepped foot in Minnesota before arriving this summer. \nGallery: Most members of the Mesabi Range College Norsemen football team had never stepped foot in Minnesota before arriving this summer. \nThey arrived in early August at the campus with one building for classrooms, a college smaller than many high schools. \nMesabi is governed by the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA), as opposed to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), which regulates Division I, II and III four-year schools, everything in Minnesota from the Gophers in the top division to St. John’s and St. Thomas in Division III. \nThe NJCAA has 511 member schools, but only 68 field football teams. Mesabi is evidence of the hardships that have prompted many junior colleges to drop football, including Minnesota schools such as Normandale, Anoka-Ramsey and Hibbing. Aiming for a long shot \nTaped to the wall outside the coach’s office was the latest story on running back Khiry Robinson, who attended Mesabi and now plays for the NFL’s New Orleans Saints. But the numbers say that for most of the Norsemen the odds of succeeding, especially on that level, are long. Only six players returned from last year’s team, suggesting that many simply gave up or drifted to something else. “Most of them just went different ways,” said Kalil Grice, a defensive lineman from Florida who stayed and works in the school library. \nOf 65 players since 2010 who were even on the team for a second season at the two-year school, only 21 earned a degree at Mesabi. Of 14 second-year players on the 2013 team, four graduated from Mesabi. Of nine second-year players on last year’s team, only one earned a degree. \nBut a school official said the figure can be misleading: Though only one football player graduated last year, the school estimated an additional six to eight players successfully transferred to a four-year college. PRE-GAME TRADITION: Mesabi Range players walked to Virginia High School's football field, a path with views of the town water tower and water treatment facility, before taking on Vermillion in late September. \nLast year’s grade-point average for the team was 2.62 on a 4.0 academic scale — the highest since 2010. But a school official added that the team’s grade-point average has never been below 2.36 in the past five years. \nThe football field is a daily reminder how far removed players are from big-time college sports — and how indifferent Iron Range residents can be to the team. When Mesabi opened its home season on Sept. 6 — it uses a high school field near the college — only 44 people were in the stands at kickoff. On their mile-long walks from the school to Target and Kmart, the players regularly passed a parked pickup truck with a large Confederate flag in its window. \nDespite their rough edges, the players frequently showed a softer side. After every practice, the team gathered on the practice field to say the Lord’s Prayer, and many players — especially those from the South — addressed adults with “yes sir” and “no sir.” \nThomas Dorsey, a defensive back from Chicago, said he arrived in Minnesota after getting clearance from his probation officer to leave Illinois. “I was locked up in the joint,” Dorsey explained, standing outside his campus apartment. Dorsey said he was at a New Year’s Eve party, trying to fire his .380 pistol into the air in celebration when the gun jammed and the police arrived. \n“It was just a mistake,” Dorsey said. “l wasn’t right with God. Now, I’m right with God.” \nHe worked at Walmart, then made seats for Chicago transit buses. Both of his brothers, he said, served time in jail. Now four years out of high school, he decided one month before practice began to come to Minnesota. “You get sucked up whole by it,” he said of his neighborhood on Chicago’s South Side. But “it’s cool out here” in Minnesota. “It’s mellow. You [chill]. Virginia, Minnesota, changed my life.” \nWhen he turns 30, Dorsey said, “I want a degree under my belt.” \nElvin Turner, the linebacker and team co-captain from Chicago, spoke to his mother by phone early in the morning on every gameday. “She prays for me. We have a little talk. She tells me, ‘Good luck,’” he said. “This is another opportunity [to] try and make my mama proud.” \nTurner, moments before Mesabi’s first game, got emotional with Ben Allen, a friend and defensive back from Georgia. “You got your second shot, man,” said Turner, looking Allen in the eye. “God do things for a reason.” Aaron Lavinsky Surrounded by Eveleth, Gilbert and Virginia locals, linemen Uriah English, left, and Levi Ritacco tossed kicker Nolan Johnson into Lake Ore-be-gone during a cliff diving trip before practice in mid-August.

FREE TIME: From upper left, clockwise, Mesabi players try their hand at diving into Lake Ore-be-gone; teammates share a night out at Bg’s Bar and Grill after practice; volunteers at a local church help welcome the many new players to Virginia. The welcome \nTwo blocks from the empty storefronts on Chestnut Street, the Norsemen in late August lowered themselves into the warmth of the basement at Hope Community Presbyterian, an old church with an equally aging congregation. Women from the congregation served hot dogs and chicken on paper plates. The hulking players sat awkwardly in a dining room with checkered tablecloths. \nWhite-haired Jacquie Ault sat down to break the ice with Mike Ritacco, a defensive back with multiple tattoos, and began talking about her dog. “I have a nine-month-old baby pit bull,” Ritacco said politely, in reply. “They are very scary dogs, [but] it’s all how you raise them.” \nStanding off to the side, Janet Koski pronounced the annual luncheon, which began more than a decade ago, a success. “We don’t expect anything in return, [just] hope they know they’re welcome here,” she said. \nPepper Lysaker spent 31 years as Mesabi coach before retiring in 1998 and was a catalyst in recruiting black players from out of state. It was a move borne of necessity, he said, as football rosters at local high schools shrunk amid a long but fundamental downturn in the Iron Range’s mining industry that scattered a community settled by European immigrants. \n“Some of these little old ladies would go to a supermarket, and here would come a black kid. And they were afraid,” said the former coach. “These [Iron Rangers] came from Yugoslavia. They came from Finland. They worked hard. [But] they got the old-fashioned attitudes.” \nThe influx of out-of-state players has not come without problems for the state’s northern junior colleges.
