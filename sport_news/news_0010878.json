By then, he had seen more than enough. Unbeaten and nationally ranked James Madison flattened the Phoenix 51-0 on Saturday afternoon, a Colonial Athletic Association football rout that delivered some unwanted pieces of history and did nothing to enhance the homecoming vibe at Rhodes Stadium. “They outplayed us in every phase of the game,” Elon defensive end Rob Sullivan said. “We had turnovers. They put up over 600 yards. It’s just a bad game all around. Very disappointing.” With James Madison, the No. 5-ranked team in the Football Championship Subdivision, scoring at its usual prolific pace and Elon either unable to keep up or frittering away its scoring chances, this became the most lopsided loss for the Phoenix in its brief season and a half in the league. Elon (2-5 overall, 1-3 CAA) suffered its second shutout loss here in 15 years of home games at Rhodes Stadium and its first such defeat in nearly 11 years. The date was Oct. 23, 2004, when the other of those home goose eggs occurred. “You have to score to stay in a game like that and we obviously didn’t do that at all,” Thompson said. “Your job as a quarterback is to sustain drives and score. We can’t expect our defense to go drive after drive after drive and stop a good football team like that. You can’t expect any defense to do that.” The Dukes (7-0, 4-0) rapidly got to work on improving their best start to a season in school history — and by extension, setting up next weekend’s showdown against Richmond for first place in the league. Cardon Johnson ripped off an 80-yard touchdown run on James Madison’s third play of the game, a third-and-1 that broke open with Johnson outracing the chasing pursuit of Elon linebacker Corey Mitchell and safety Miles Williams. That marked the first substantial chunk of James Madison’s 406-yard rushing performance. Johnson, a sophomore, finished with a career-best 165 yards and Khalid Abdullah added 75 yards. Both backs reached the end zone twice. “The only way to really slow them down is eliminating those big runs,” Elon coach Rich Skrosky said, noting that James Madison entered Saturday averaging more than 48 points per game. “And we obviously gave up too many big runs.” James Madison cranked out four straight touchdown drives with its up-tempo offense to close the first half leading 34-0. Johnson’s score from a yard out with 57 seconds left in the second quarter followed 4- and 2-yard touchdown runs by Abdullah and Vad Lee’s 7-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jonathan Kloosterman. Page 2 of 2 - Lee, the star quarterback, had plenty of time to wait, examine and then make that throw. Early in the third quarter, he rolled out and hit John Miller on what became a 27-yard touchdown pass to push James Madison ahead 41-0. Miller caught that pass on the sideline and sidestepped charging Elon safety Chris Blair with a swipe move to get free and into the end zone. Lee’s day was done after three quarters. He went 16 of 22 passing for 198 yards and ran for 66 more yards. James Madison piled up 604 yards of total offense, which actually fell a bit short of its prodigious average on the season (614.5 yards per game). Meanwhile, Elon’s Thompson (13 of 26 passing for 130 yards) was intercepted twice, both times by James Madison cornerback Taylor Reynolds. The first one, with Elon trailing 13-0, stopped a drive to the Dukes’ 26-yard line. Thompson called that throw into coverage for Corey Joyner in the end zone the wrong decision. “I thought it was man-to-man and the corner ended up bailing and falling under it,” Thompson said. “Bad with my eyes. That was the biggest thing with me all day. I had poor eyes and poor decision-making.” In the second half, Elon came up empty on two drives into the red zone. The Dukes stuffed B.J. Bennett and Thompson on three straight runs inside the 5, a sequence near the goal line that ended with Bennett managing a yard on fourth-and-2 from the 4. Elon stalled on fourth-and-4 at the James Madison 15 late in the game, two plays after a pass from backup Connor Christiansen hit off the hands of reserve tight end John Luke Arrington, who was open heading into the end zone. Skrosky said there was no need to bother with attempting field goals in those situations. “If it’s 51-3 or 51-6, you’re still losing bad,” he said. “You can kick, but I think we have a pretty good idea of what (kicker) John (Gallagher) can do. I don’t know if I needed to see a 28-yard field goal. “You’ve got to take your ego aside from it and build the team and build the program, and that’s what goes into that decision. ‘Can we execute in the red zone? Can we execute on the goal line?’” ■ EXTRA POINTS …: Elon was shut out by an FCS opponent for the first time in 10 seasons, since November 2005 at The Citadel. … James Madison collected its largest margin of victory on the road in school history. “We don’t overlook anybody,” said Dukes coach Everett Withers, adding that his team operated with a businesslike approach. … Thompson, the Elon true freshman, has been intercepted eight times in the last three games, all against Top 20 teams in the FCS. … The first carry in James Madison freshman Trai Sharp’s career went for a 64-yard gain in the fourth quarter. The Carrboro product later scored to cap that drive and increase the Dukes’ lead to 51-0. … Elon’s Gallagher missed a field goal from 48 yards in the second quarter. … The open date arrives next on Elon’s schedule. After the week off from games, the Phoenix plays on Halloween at Stony Brook.
