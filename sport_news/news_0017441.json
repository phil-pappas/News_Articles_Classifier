( Sean Star/Loveland Reporter-Herald ) \nFORT COLLINS — A few years ago the NCAA moved up the date when men's basketball teams could start practicing, from mid October to late September, or 42 days before the first game of the season. \nPretty much every team in the county takes advantage of the rule change — except for Colorado State, which didn't have its first official practice until Friday morning. \nCoach Larry Eustachy hardly eased his team into the new season, going for a good three hours at Moby Arena. And afterward, the coach entering his fourth year at CSU had nothing but good things to say. \n\"I thought it was as good of a first day as I've had. Our assistants have done a great job with these new rules in the summer. It wasn't like the first day of a normal practice,\" Eustachy said. \"Our guys knew where to be, how to do it. Their conditioning was exceptional. The receptiveness to coaching was exceptional. That'll change once they start getting tired, but yeah, I don't think we have a bad player.\" \nInstead of starting practice six weeks before the first game of the season like most teams, Friday marked just a month before the team's 2015-16 opener at Northern Iowa on Nov. 19 in Cedar Falls, Iowa. \nBut it's not like the Rams are losing out. Teams that start early can't practice as often now as they do in the regular season. Instead, Eustachy would rather stick to his routine and not have to worry about scheduling extra days off. Advertisement \n\"We're probably the only school in the country to start today. But the way it works out, we always practice Monday through Saturday and always take Sunday off. There's an extra day we still have to take off (if we started two weeks ago), so nobody gained an advantage on us. It's the routine we're used to,\" Eustachy said. \"It's almost like you think you're missing out, like you should be practicing because somebody else is getting ahead of you. And really it all equals out, I think. Kimani Jackson, left, is defended by teammate Emmanuel Omogbo during Friday's practice at Moby Arena. ( Sean Star/Loveland Reporter-Herald ) \n\"Some of your worst practices you have are when you have two days off.\" \nThe Rams welcome five newcomers to the program this year — freshmen Prentiss Nixon, Anthony Bonner and Nico Carvacho and junior college transfers Kimani Jackson and Emmanuel Omogbo. \nThe first year, let alone the first practice, in Eustachy's system can take some getting used to for a lot of players, but that adjustment Friday was minimized thanks to the team's veterans. \n\"Our older guys have done a great job of telling the new guys what it's going to be like, what's acceptable and what's not,\" Eustachy said. \"Our older guys are our best messenger of anyone on what to expect.\" \nOf the five newcomers, Jackson and Omogbo are the most likely to make an immediate impact this season. And Eustachy likes what he saw from the two forwards. \n\"They're both talented enough and willing to listen,\" he said. \"The ceiling for those guys, if that's their first day, just think about their last day of practice by the end of the year.\" \nFor Omogbo, rated as one of the top junior college transfers in the country out of South Plains College (Lubbock, Texas), the hardest part of Friday was learning to be on the same page with all his new teammates. \n\"My coach always told me in junior college, listen, listen, listen and execute. That's all it's about, listening and executing,\" he said. \"I need to do a better job of listening and just going over plays, playing through when I'm tired. And of course the air is a little different.\" \nWhile Omogbo and most of the other Rams have been in town for much of the summer in the weight room and working individually and in groups with the team's assistant coaches, Jackson didn't arrive until just before fall semester started in late August after having to fulfil academic requirements at his previous school (New Mexico Junior College). \nBut far, the Arlington, Texas, native likes his new home. \n\"I like Fort Collins, that's the reason why I chose here,\" he said. \"It's a different vibe. Everything's different. I like the coaching staff, teammates, everyone.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T23:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:41:33.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
