Posted: Monday, October 5, 2015 9:17 pm Luck 'trending in right direction' as Thursday's game approaches By George Bremer | The Herald Bulletin Herald Bulletin Posted on Oct 5, 2015 by George Bremer \nINDIANAPOLIS — The most scrutinized right shoulder in Indiana officially caused Andrew Luck again to be listed as \"limited\" in Monday's practice. \nBut some of the outlying indicators were more positive for the Indianapolis Colts quarterback who is hopeful of returning to the starting lineup for Thursday's game at Houston. \nMatt Hasselbeck started Sunday's 16-13 overtime victory against Jacksonville and completed 30 of 47 passes for 282 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions. In the process, he became just the ninth quarterback in NFL history to throw for at least 275 yards with one or more touchdowns at age 40 or older. \nBut the veteran doesn't sound confident he'll get an encore performance. \n\"I'm going to get myself ready to play,\" Hasselbeck said. \"I don't expect to play. But I will be ready to play in case I'm needed.\" \nWXIN's Chris Hagan reported early in the afternoon that Luck suffered a partial separation — or subluxation — of the shoulder during a Sept. 27 win at Tennessee. Hagan's report further stated the quarterback underwent an MRI last week and saw three out-of-state doctors to gauge opinions for rehabbing the injury. \nThe Colts did not confirm that diagnosis, with head coach Chuck Pagano saying he's heard only that Luck is suffering from a \"sore shoulder.\" But NFL Media's Ian Rapoport — who reported the Colts plan on starting Luck against the Texans — agreed with the partial separation. \nRapoport also reported there is no structural damage within the shoulder, and Hagan's sources claimed the main concerns were pain tolerance and arm strength. \nLuck participated in a private throwing session on Saturday and wasn't ruled out until the final hours before Sunday's game. \nPagano said the quarterback's shoulder continued to improve over the weekend. Luck threw only a pair of short screen passes to running back Frank Gore during the portion of Monday's practice open to the media. \nWith another game just four days away, the brief session was run in shorts without pads or helmets and amounted to a walk-through. \n\"He looked good,\" Pagano said of Luck. \"He's moving in the right direction, trending in the right direction, a lot better than he was Saturday.\" \nLuck is expected to address the media Tuesday at the Indiana Farm Bureau Football Center.
