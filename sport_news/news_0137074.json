The defense was as physical as it has been all year and Hagar made numerous saves when the defense would let a runner free, but MMA was just too much for the Kirksville soccer team. MMA’s Jesus Garcia scored four goals, three in the second half, and MMA turned away every Kirksville attack to send the Tigers into the offseason with a 5-0 loss in the first round of the Class 2, District 8 tournament. “We heard this team was physical, so coach Manny Tovar went out there and told us to be physical, mark up and do the best we could,” Hagar said. The physicality of the game was noticed by the referees with the amount of fouls and yellow cards that were given out. Kirksville’s Seger Nelson was sent off the field for a few minutes and MMA’s Jose Estrada and Juan Diego Silva picked up yellow cards in the second half as Kirksville’s physicality got to them. “We told the players that MMA would be physical, so the last few games we’ve been playing more physical, so we started getting better at being a physical team. That’s what we wanted to do,” Tovar said. “They play physical but don’t like to be touched, which is kind of counter productive, and I think we got in their head.” Even MMA’s coach admitted that his team still has some growing up to do, but was a lot stronger than it was at this point last season. “We weren’t very mentally strong (last year) and I think overall we’ve become stronger in our mentality. We’re used to teams coming out and playing us physically. We’ve still got some maturity to grow on but at the same time we’re still a very skilled team and the boys believe in themselves,” MMA coach Kevin Farley said. Last season, Kirksville pulled the upset over MMA but Farley doesn’t think revenge was on the minds of his players. At least, not openly. “We didn’t really talk about it much. Maybe behind closed doors some of the seniors may have said a few things to each other but overall, we look at this as another day at the office as we try to move one step closer to a state championship,” Farley said. While MMA managed to get goals in the first half, Tovar thinks that part of that was on bad clears from his defense and his players not moving their feet. Page 2 of 2 - “Defensively, I think some of it was our own bad clearances and we weren’t able to clear it,” Tovar said. “There was some diving at the ball as well, which we tell the boys to always move their feet.” Even though the score was a bit lopsided, Tovar was pleased with his team’s effort for its first time seeing MMA. “MMA is a good team, who’s skilled, but I thought we played well seeing them for the first time,” Tovar said. Farley was impressed with how aggressive Kirksville is and figures, with all the young talent Kirksville has on its roster, that it will have a bright future. “What I always like about Kirksville is that they always go 100 percent, they don’t care if the team is better or worse than them, they just go after the ball,” Farley said. “I know they are a young team but I’m very impressed with their No. 3 (Nelson). He’s a very good player who’s enjoyable to watch. I’m sure Kirksville has a very bright future.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T06:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:33:03.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
