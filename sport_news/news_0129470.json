The win guaranteed the Raiders a spot in the Division 2 South playoffs and ensured next Saturday’s visit from Milton will decide the Bay State Conference Herget Division.\n“We’re not turning the ball over — that’s a big factor — and we’re practicing well,” Raiders coach Jesse Davis said. “We need to have another great week of practice, that’s definitely the key to our success. If we have a good week of practice, we will play well in the game.”\nWellesley linebacker Will Cramer intercepted Norwood’s Joe Leanos near midfield, and a 12-yard return put the Raiders in business at the Norwood 36-yard line.\nWellesley (6-0, 4-0) cashed in five plays later when Grant Chryssicas scored from 9 yards out for a 7-0 lead with 3:41 left in the first quarter.\nWhen Norwood threw incomplete on fourth down midway through the second quarter, the Raiders took over at their 47.\nWellesley only needed four plays to return to the end zone. Chryssicas (nine carries, 67 yards) scored on a dive play up the middle, bouncing out to the left after getting past the line of scrimmage for a 30-yard TD with 4:18 to go in the first half.\nRunning a flexbone offense, the Raiders chew up yardage. Wellesley rushed for 171 yards, with Myles Cole leading the way with 77 on 13 carries.\n“It’s not always sexy, but it’s been effective for us,” Davis said.\nSafety Brendan Dolan had an interception on the final play of the first half, and outside linebacker Sam McGee recovered a fumble in the third quarter. The Mustangs (3-3, 1-3) could penetrate no deeper than the Wellesley 37 all afternoon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:27:03.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
