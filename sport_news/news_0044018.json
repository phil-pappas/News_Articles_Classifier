It marked just the second time Butch Jones has beaten a ranked team in his three years as the Volunteers head coach. Reggie Davis' 70-yard punt return put Georgia up 24-3 with three-and-a-half minutes to play in the second quarter. Vols fans were uncomfortable, but Butch Jones says his team remained resilient. Jones-\"We're down 24-3 versus a top 25 football team, and our kids never flinched.\" Sure enough, the Vols added two touchdowns before halftime, and it was game on from there. Said receiver Josh Smith-\"I felt like the receivers came to play. We made the plays we needed to win. So I'm just proud of this team.\" Josh Dobbs smokey gray uniform was missing a cape. He was named the SEC player of the week for his performance. 118-yards rushing and 312 yards passing. Said Jones-\"Josh willed our offense to score points.\" Brian Randolph swatted away Georgia's potential tying touchdown on the final play of the game to seal the 38-31 victory. Said defensive back Cam Sutton-\"Guys had that 'it' factor. Guys were hungry out there on the field. You could see the look in everybody's eyes. We wanted it more than them.\" Said Jones-\"The biggest joy was watching them. Having them be able to go to the band and celebrate with our fan base. We've been through so much in the last few weeks. But it's all about the kids.\" Added linebacker Jalen Reeves-Maybin-\"It's definitely big. Going into the bye week. Get back healthy. Get rested. Finish the second half of the season a lot stronger than we did the first.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:03:34.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
