She's been the No. 1 or 2 runner for Marshfield the past two years and loving it. \n\"Morgan had taken some really big improvements the past few years,\" Marshfield coach Dan Akin said. \"She put in a lot of work during the spring and summer to improve herself and get on our varsity. \n\"Last year she was our No. 1 runner a few times and she's been our first runner all season this year. She is really having a nice season.\" \nIrish placed 15th at the Valley meet last Saturday, up 10 sports from her junior year and a few weeks ago she was the Medford Invite's girls champion. \nYou made all-conference at the Wisconsin Valley Conference meet last Saturday. What did that mean to you? It means a lot. I worked so hard in the offseason. I think what I did at conference shows you can accomplish a lot when you work hard for something. I couldn't' be happier with how the meet went for me. \nHow do you think you can improve for this week's sectional meet? I think I still have to push myself in practice and not slack off. Running is mental too. I have to run by best race and not try to think that this could be my last high school cross country race. \nWhat was some of the things you did to crack the varsity your junior year? A lot of it was what I didn't in the offseason and during the summer. I did a lot of running in the summer and lifted weights. It's also important to eat right. I worked hard to get on varsity. \nWhat is the toughest course you've run? The course at The Ridges Golf Course for the Wisconsin Rapids Invite. It's different than the state course, but it's still challenging. The last mile and a half is all hills, so it's tough really pace yourself and the last 800 you really have to push it to finish strong. This year it was windy and freezing and that made it even tougher. \nThis is the second year the girls have run 5K for races. Have you gotten used to it? I have, but it was challenging at first. You had to learn when to push yourself because we were running a longer race. And you have to know the course better so you know when to kick it in. \nWhat are some things you want to accomplish by the time you're 30? I want to graduate college with a degree in nursing, have a steady job and maybe be starting a family. \nHow did you decide that you wanted to go into nursing? My mom is a respiratory therapist and I have other family and friends that are in the healthcare field. I'm already a CNA and I got that through a class at school and that helped me decide that I wanted to go into nursing. \nWhat is your biggest fear? For me or a close family member getting cancer. It runs in my family. \nTell me something that people would be surprised to know about you: That I'm deathly afraid of frogs. I run the other way when I see them. I'm not a fan of reptiles. \nMark Massoglia can be reached at 715-423-7200, ext. 4736 or mark.massoglia@gannettwisconsin.com .
