For the first time in program history the Skyhawks (9-2-1, 7-1-0 Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference) went to Golden and came away with a win against Colorado School of Mines, a 2-1 victory that solidified the Skyhawks’ first-place standing in the RMAC. Alicia Sanchez scored the game-winning goal again for Fort Lewis. It’s the fourth time this season she’s scored the decisive goal. FLC’s Courtney Riley scored scored the game’s first goal. “This is a huge win for us, and it definitely puts us at No. 1 in conference for now,” FLC head coach Jimmy Hall said in a phone interview with The Durango Herald. “It was a very intense game and it was a grind, but it was the type of game that good teams win. We’re thrilled.” Fort Lewis was outshot 11-4, which is common with the Skyhawks are comfortable giving up low quality shots knowing they have the leadership and skill of senior goalkeeper Caitlyn Espinosa gobbling up opponents’ chances. After a scoreless first half, Riley scored her fourth goal of the season to give the Skyhawks a 1-0 lead in the 47th minute. Hometown girl and senior Brooke Milliet set up the score with a beautiful cross that found Riley in front of the net in open space. The Orediggers (7-3-2, 5-1-2 RMAC) answered back 13 minutes later, as Haley Cole tied the game in the 60th minute when she poked in a cross that got through the Skyhawks’ back line. As Fort Lewis fans know, when the score is tied late in the game, it’s Sanchez time. In the 66th minute, Sanchez got her foot on a loose ball in the box and, as she’s proven time and again this season, she knew what to do with it. The sophomore buried it in the back of the net, and it held up as another game-winner for Fort Lewis. “She’s so calm under pressure, and she’s just getting stronger as the year goes on,” Hall said. The Skyhawks will look to keep the momentum rolling against Colorado Christian at 1:30 p.m. Sunday in Lakewood. “It’s really exciting, but we’re trying to keep the girls focused and sane,” Hall said. “The records and the firsts are things for coaches to worry about. Every game counts and we have to take everyone seriously.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:18:51.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
