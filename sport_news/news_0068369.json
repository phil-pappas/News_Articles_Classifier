The Cougars’ coach wanted to get her defense some publicity, and for good reason. \nSchalick (4-7-1) has allowed a paltry 13 goals this season, the second-best per-game average (1.08) in the area behind only Delsea, which has given up just six goals in 11 games (.55). \n“They’re not putting the ball in the back of the net, but they’re the ones holding us in these games,” Logandro said of the Cougars' defense, as all four of the team's victories have come via shutout. “They’re really what’s keeping us in there.” \nSchalick's success in the back end starts with its junior keeper, Emily Camp , who is tied for the area lead with three clean sheets. \n“Emily has a passion for the game,” Logandro said. “She’s a student of the game, she loves the game. She motivates the girls and she stays positive.” \n“She has saved our butts a couple times, on quite a few occasions (actually),” added senior defender Lauren Kenny . \nBut Camp hasn’t done it alone. \nKenny and fellow seniors Taylor Ismail and Emma Stratoti have all made major strides from a season ago and have done a good job keeping the ball away from Camp. \nThat’s due in part to improved communication between the trio. \n“We understand each other and we listen to each other,” Ismail said. “We know what needs to get done.” \nThe three also have unique strengths that blend well together. \nStratoti is the strongest on-the-ball defender of the group, according to Logandro, while Kenny is the best of the three in the air. \nAs for Ismail, the sweeper, she’s got the most versatile game of the bunch. \n“She’s just an amazing player all around,” Camp said. “I’m so happy to have her on my team. She’s is just a great player overall. Girls soccer notebook: Buena benefiting from experience \n“I’m very happy with my defense and it can only get better.” \nThat defense can help the Cougars make a lot of noise in the postseason if they get that far, but the offense needs to find a groove. Schalick has scored an area-low nine goals, half that of Bridgeton, which is next on the list with 18. \nThe Cougars did step up last week, scoring a pair in a 2-0 triumph over Woodstown on Oct. 7 and earning a 1-1 tie with Cumberland on Friday. \nIf that continues, Schalick could be a tough out for every squad left on its schedule. \n“The last two games started to feel like they got their confidence,” Logandro said. “Once they put a few in the back of the net, the floodgates will open.” \nCrusader defense standing tall \nDelsea’s defense was stellar last season, allowing just 30 goals in 22 games. \nHowever, the Crusaders lost sweeper Rachel Geissler and midfielder Kailey Russo to graduation, and their work in the back end was instrumental to the squad’s success. \nDelsea hasn’t lost a beat without those two though, as Megan Hunter , Daryan Fennal , Mackenzie Miller and Lexi Grochowski have been strong in front of keeper Hannah Seabert. T he Crusaders haven’t given up more than one goal in any game this year. \n“Hannah has made some big-time saves and the back line is really playing well together,” coach Misty Russo said. \nSeabert’s play stood out in Friday’s 3-0 win over Glassboro, as she finished the game with 17 saves. \nCorner kicks \nWhen Buena’s Aysiah Cintron scores a goal, she tends to do it multiple times. Cintron has found the back of the net in four games this season, scoring at least two goals in each contest. Delsea’s Cassidy McErlain is the only other area player that has four multi-goal games. ... Four different Vineland players have had multi-goal games this season, the latest being freshman Gabby Perez , who scored a pair in a 3-2 win over Absegami on Friday. She joined teammates Sarah Patringani , Cate Scanlon and Melanie Milam on that list. OLMA is the only other area team that has had four different players record multi-goal games — Tia Dupont , Lizzie Nealis , Dana DaSilva and Katie Kavanagh . \nJosh’s Kickin’ Five* \n1.
