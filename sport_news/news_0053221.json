Each of these bowlers has many accomplishments, too many to list in this column, but I will give you some of the highlights of each bowler's career to show why they are deserving of this honor. \nStewart has served as President of the local association along with many other duties while a member of the board. Stewart is also an accomplished bowler having shot a 300 for his high game and over 40 700 series. Stewart has participated in many professional senior regional events and carries a Senior PBA card. \nHe has coached high school bowling and bowled on the U.S. Army team. He is a life member of the Anderson Bowling Association and is a squad leader of the Indiana State Seniors Tournament. He continues to bowl in the Indiana State Masters and multiple leagues. \nElrod has also shot a perfect 300 game and has a high series of 771. Elrod has bowled in numerous leagues during his career with a high average of 205. Elrod has held the office of Vice President and Secretary/Treasurer in several leagues over the years. He is a certified instructor and enjoys teaching the sport of bowling. Elrod is a quiet man who always has a smile and kind word for everyone he meets. \nNorton will be the only female bowler entering the Hall of Fame. Norton will be honored posthumously as she passed away in 2014. She served as president, vice president and seargent-at-arms in many leagues over a 15-year span. \nNorton was a member of the Anderson WBA and USBC Associations for more than 35 years. She accomplished a 266 high game and 722 high series. Even her battle with cancer and chemotherapy sessions couldn’t keep her off the lanes. One day after a session, Norton decided to bowl one game. After that 197 game, she continued on to bowl a 211 and 213 for a 621 series. \nThe annual Hall of Fame banquet will be held at the FOP Lodge on Oct. 11 at noon. Please see an association member for tickets and help us celebrate the honor of these three deserving individuals. \nWe have had some more honor scores reported this last week. Charlie Colip and Jaxon Fetty both have scored well this past week. Colip shot a 299 game with a 721 series in the Pick Your Partner league Monday. He put a good shot on the 12th ball but left the 7-pin on a light mixer to finish one pin short of a perfect game. This was Colip’s second 299, having shot one in the TKO Scholarship Tourney. He may get that perfecto soon if he keeps rolling the ball like he has lately. \nFetty shot 279 on the Saturday Majors league. Fetty also shot a 277 in the TKO Tourney. May they both find perfection soon.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:31:33.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
