Lester, who won a pair of World Series rings with the Boston Red Sox in 2007 and 2013, is on the roster in case Arrieta has a short start or the game extends into extra innings. \nThe Cubs placed 10 pitchers and 15 position players on their 25-man roster. The winner advances to the NL Division Series against St. Louis starting Friday. \nRosters can be reset for each postseason series.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T18:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:32:40.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
