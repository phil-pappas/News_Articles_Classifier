(Thomas Johnson and Randolph Smith/The Washington Post) \nOn the comeback and the final drive: “Yeah, I’m just really proud of the way our team kept playing. It really does take all three phases. I mean that onside kick made a huge difference in our ability to come back. So it takes all three phases to be able to do that. I was proud of the resiliency and the character. That’s what we need week in and week out. On the last drive, it was just nothing fancy, just getting completions and trying to gradually move the ball down the field and not run out of time. Thankfully, there were great play calls along the way, great individual one-on-one route running and good protection. I just need to get the ball out of my hand and find those completions. And next thing you know, we scored. It was definitely a great moment for us as a team.” \nOn what changed at halftime: “It’s no miracle speech. It’s just understanding we’ve got a job to do and we didn’t get it done in the first half and it’s now or never to get this win. We knew we were running out of time and we didn’t have a choice. Again, the onside kick and great stops by the defense, that kind of thing is what gives your offense a chance, gave us a short field. And guys started making great plays, making individual, one-on-one – winning their matchups. I was just really proud of the way we kept playing. It was a really good lesson. Just keep playing and you never know what could happen.” Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins listens to a question during a postgame press conference. (Alex Brandon/Associated Press) \nOn getting the win heading into the bye week: “Getting a win is a great feeling. You don’t want to sit on a loss on a bye week. That’s always tough. It was a step in the right direction. We’re going to need a lot more than three wins this year, but it was a good step. We’ve just got to keep learning, man, keep growing. There are certainly plenty of plays we want to learn from and have back and improve upon. So just keep playing, but certainly feel good about this one.” \nOn the winning touchdown play: “We had four to one side and Jordan [Reed] on the other. They played man coverage from what it looked like to me. Jordan did a great job winning his one-on-one matchup, and we scored. That was it. Great job by him. Great play call and good execution all the way around.” \nOn if he knew he was going to Reed and what makes the tight end so good: “We have reads and rules. Based on the coverage and based on the play, my rules and read took me to him. And what makes him so special, he’s a talented player. He’s wired to be able to separate. He’s got great hands. He’s a competitor. He makes a big difference. A great teammate, a great person, and I’m looking forward, again. He’s a young player, and I feel like we all just need to keep developing, keep growing, keep working. I’m excited about his future. I think it’s very bright.” Redskins tight end Jordan Reed, right, crosses the goal line after catching the game-winning touchdown with 24 seconds left. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post) \nOn a sense of calm and confidence in the huddle on the final drive: “Well if there’s a sense of panic in the huddle, we’re in trouble, so I hope there’s calm and confidence at all times. That’s the way we operate. We always try to say ‘one play at a time.’ Try to find a completion and execute your job and we’ll see where we are after this play, and then we’ll talk on the next play. But yeah, I would agree there was calm and confidence. That’s what you need and that’s what there should be all the time.” \nOn bouncing back from bad throws: “Just go to the next play. Do what the play calls for you to do and try to execute it the best that you can. As I’ve said many, many times, there’s tight windows in this league. There’s really good coverage and if you are afraid to let one go, it’s going to be tough to move the ball. So you’ve got to be able to see stuff quickly, get the ball out of your hand quickly and make quick decisions. If you want to be an explosive offense, you’re going to have to live with some setbacks now and then, turnovers and that kind of a thing. But certainly we’re always trying to cut back on those and learn from them and continue to try to make good decisions as often as possible.” \nOn responding to boos: “You certainly don’t want to hear them. They paid for their ticket. They can do what they want. But I heard cheers at the end. That’s all that matters.” \n[ D.C. Sports Bog : You like that? Kirk Cousins says you did ] \nOn bootlegs and plays that are helping set up the offense better: “Yeah, I think that’s a great question for Sean McVay or Jay Gruden just because they’re the ones calling the plays, but I feel like if we can get out on the edge and not feel like the pass rush is getting to us on that edge, than it gives us a chance. It was great play calls all day long keeping them off balance. Just keep going and learn from this one.” \nOn his last four passes: “I really can’t remember all of them. We hit the one to Crowder versus man coverage. It was a great job by Jamison going down the sideline and going up to get the ball. Again, a very talented player making a great play. Then I think we threw a fade route to Jordan in the corner. Just overthrew it a little bit. He could have gone up and gotten it if I had left it inbounds a little bit better, so it’s certainly a throw that I’ll go back and look at critically. Then the next one, yeah, it’s a bang-bang play. They play two deep, and I try to hit it on Crowder on it quickly. And I didn’t feel like I had his eyes quickly enough, so I kind of tried to throw it to a safe spot over his head, but then the safety was in play there, too. It all happened so fast. I’ll try to go back and look at it, but definitely a play you want to learn from and try not to make that mistake in terms of throwing into coverage going forward. And then the last play, you know like we said, Jordan won his one-on-one matchup and it was a great play call, made it easy on me, and we won.” \nOn being stoic: “I try to stay like this, man [moves hand on an even line]. I don’t hit the panic button when things are going bad. And I don’t feel like we’ve got it all figured out when we win. It’s a step in the process. It’s Week 7 and we’ve got a long ways to go. We’ve got to learn from the plays that didn’t go well just as much as we’ve got to enjoy the ones that did. Am I going to enjoy this one tonight? Yeah, absolutely. It’s probably unhealthy to just always be stoic. But at the same time, it’s not like all our problems are solved and we have everything figured out. But at the same time, when I throw two interceptions and we lose, I’m not going to freak out and push the panic button either. And if I start to do that, I won’t last in this league very long. So I just try to stay like this [motions hand] within the game, just stay like [motions hand] this and see where we are at the end.” \nOn if he was tipped off to the onside kick: “Yeah, typically, you want to tip your offense to, hey, this is an onside, so be ready. We might get it, and you don’t want to be caught off guard. You do get tipped off on it. It takes great execution by your kicker but also by your coverage team. They’ve got to make the play. It was a great call by our special teams coaches to scout that all week long and see that play there. That’s something that takes a lot of film study and preparation and walking through and running through. It turned out to be a crucial, pivotal play in the game.” \nOn learning from previous comebacks: “I think the lesson I learn from the drive a couple weeks ago was just you don’t have to get it all back in one play. Just find completions. We really didn’t have any – I don’t believe we had any long, deep throws in that two-minute [drill]. It was just stuff five, 10 yards down the field. Guys ran after the catch. Sometimes that’s all it takes. So you don’t have to try to do too much, just try to execute the plays that are called and get completions. The next thing you know we were in the red zone. I feel like we got down there quickly.” \n[ Cousins powers Redskins’ rally from down 24 to beat Bucs, 31-30 ] \nOn learning from things in game or just moving ahead: “Yeah, I think you’re always trying to learn. I mean after every drive I’m going to come off the field and look at the pictures and say, ‘Kay, what did they do?’ and ‘What do I need to do better?’ and ‘Why didn’t it work?’ You’re always trying to be hard on yourself and see how you can do it better whether it’s in-game, or postgame or post-season or whatever it is.” \nOn the fumble that was returned for a touchdown: “Yeah, it was a play where they did a good job getting to me and didn’t sense in there to the level that I should have, I guess you could say. In that sense I’m looking left so my right side became my blind side and I can’t feel him behind me and I take two hands off the ball to go throw it and it’s exposed. And that’s why we talk about avoiding sacks and getting the ball out of your hand and that kind of a thing because when you hold onto it you never know who’s coming from behind you. It was a huge play because that’s a seven-point swing right there. We have the ball somewhere near midfield, so that makes it tough. Again, a play that we’ll go back and look at and say, ‘What can we do differently?’ and ‘How can we be better?’ Yeah, go from there.” \nOn moving forward: “Yeah. I mean, again. You can’t hit the panic button. You just got to keep playing and say, alright, that happened. Next. And go from there. Thankfully, there was still plenty of time left. We had great defensive stops. We had special teams plays. All of that contributed to give us a chance at the end.” \nOn assessing his play this season: “I feel like there’s a long ways to go. I don’t think it’s my job to say how I’m playing. I think it’s your job. You guys like to do that. And I think it’s my coaches’ job and our scouts’ job to say how I’m playing. But I know that it’s my job to work really hard, to prepare really hard, to never quit, to be tough-minded and just keep going. And I’m going to keep doing that regardless of what our record is and what the results are, just keep playing and keep learning every time I’m out there.” \nOn building momentum late in the first half: “I think even the three and outs or some of the drives we had even before that where we weren’t moving the ball, we never felt like, ‘Oh boy, this is going to be a long day.’ I think we felt like there’s plays there to be made. We need to execute and we need to stick together but we can do this. Again, after that drive, like you said, I think there was belief in a sense from our play-caller to our offense that we can move the ball on these guys, we just need to settle in and execute. And usually it just comes down to everyone doing their job and doing their part.” \nMore from The Post :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:30:08.227+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
