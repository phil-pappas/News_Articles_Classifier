Comment Posted Oct. 17, 2015 at 1:51 AM By Mike MendezSports Editor Posted Oct. 17, 2015 at 1:51 AM In a 4A Division I District 8 that is loaded with competition, tickets to the playoffs will be handed out based on a mistake or two. For McPherson, it was a couple of lapses in the middle of the game that cost the Bullpups in a 26-17 loss to Abilene to open the district. “What it boiled down to, was we didn’t make a play when we needed to, and they did,” head coach Jace Pavlovich said. “And hats off. They are a very good team. But we have got to get back to work and get ready for another good team in Buhler next week.” With Abilene getting the ball to start the second half, McPherson got some huge points on a Tyson Stites field goal to go up two possessions with a 17-7 lead and 18 seconds left in the half. It was as good a half as the Bullpups could have planned. But the half wasn’t over, and neither was Abilene quarterback Harley Hazlett. Hazlett finished the half with a 61-yard touchdown run to take the momentum, and the two-possession lead away dramatically before the half. A second-half kickoff return for a touchdown from Trey Bender gave the Cowboys a 20-17 lead in two quick plays, and Abilene didn’t look back. “If we could just make that play before half, and take care of the football a little bit better field position-wise, we give ourselves a chance to get a win,” Pavlovich said. Before the Hazlett touchdown run to end the half, McPherson had the game plan humming. With a long, methodical drive, converting on third down and taking time off the clock, the Bullpups tied the game at 7-7 on a 25-yard pass from quarterback Casen Hoover to Thomas Diggs late in the first quarter. A defensive stop on fourth down gave McPherson the ball back, for another time consuming drive. This one was capped by a Taylor Kynaston battering ram across the goal line to give the Bullpups a 14-7 lead with 4:25 left in the first half. Another defensive stop, with linebacker Klayton Goering waiting to smack Hazlett in the hole on third down gave the ball right back to McPherson. The Bullpups capitalized on the Stites 31-yard field goal to create what looked to be a two-score game at the half. Then the two lightning bolts struck on both sides of the halftime whistle, giving the Cowboys a win to stay undefeated on the year, and 1-0 in districts. Austen Hunt led the Bullpups with 67 yards rushing on 16 carries. Hoover had 52 yards on the ground on 13 carries, and was 14-for-25, with 101 yards and a touchdown through the air. Page 2 of 2 - Jack Reifschneider had 5 catches for 46 yards, and Jeff Reed had 5 catches as well, for 38 yards. The loss for McPherson leaves a steep climb to earn a tenth game, making it to the playoffs. But a win on the road next week at No. 2 Buhler could be a signature win as the Bullpups keep fighting. “If we can eliminate a few of those mistakes, those mental mistakes, the sky is the limit with this group,” Pavlovich said. “We could beat Buhler next week, but we have got to put everything together.” Contact Mike Mendez at mmendez@mcphersonsentinel.com and follow him on Twitter @MendezSentinel.
