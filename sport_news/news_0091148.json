The Cougars have outscored opponents 49-0 in the first quarter including 21-point efforts against Douglas County and Campbell, the latter coming last week on homecoming at Drake Stadium. \nA 31-6 victory saw Newnan’s defense dominate the line of scrimmage while finishing with three sacks and 11 tackles for loss. Jaelin Hunter finished with a team-high 13 tackles, four of which for loss, in addition to a sack. Tyrell Harris added 12 and linebacker Emanuel Bridges had nine in a balanced effort. \nMeanwhile, senior running back Marquis Hill posted his second consecutive 170-plus yard rushing effort last week, finishing with 175 on just 13 carries, including scoring runs of 73 and 7 yards. \nHill heads into tonight with 718 yards and 10 touchdowns in seven games. \nFullback Darryell Hines stayed consistent with 48 yards rushing and a touch- down, while quarterback Chancellor Johnson was 7 of 9 pass- ing for 85 yards while connecting with receivers P.J. Harris, Randell Arnold and Zavian Cooley-Smith at least one time for the seventh consecutive game. \nNewnan now puts its focus on Pebblebrook’s wing-T in its first season under head coach Kevin Saunders. The Falcons have also eclipsed last year’s win total while now 3-4 overall and 1-3 in 3- while trying to keep their playoff hopes alive tonight. \n“You don’t see it too much anymore,” he said. “It one of those offenses teams used to run a lot, but now so many teams have gone to more of a spread offense. It’s the first time this year we have seen it.” \nPebblebrook is coming off last week’s 34-7 loss at East Coweta in a game where the Falcons couldn’t take advantage of an early drive inside the Indians’ red zone that resulted in a fumble while down 7-0. \n“If we score on the goal-line and make it 7-7, it might be a more competitive game than it was, but we fumbled in the end zone and you can’t do those things against the best teams in the region,” Saunders told the Marietta Daily Journal. \nSenior Jacobe Burke (5-10, 165), who scored Pebblebrook’s lone touchdown last week, has stepped in at quarterback after being a top receiver for the Falcons in 2014. The team snapped a 10-game region losing streak two weeks ago by defeating Campbell 27-6 at home.
