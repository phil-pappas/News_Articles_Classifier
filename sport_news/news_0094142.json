FINGER Associated Press   10:19   10:19   \nPeople: Photo Gallery: \nClick to view (6 Photos) \nPHILADELPHIA â€” Kelly Oubre Jr. and Marcin Gortat scored 16 points each and John Wall had 14 assists as the Washington Wizards cruised to a 127-118 preseason victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on Friday night. \nDeJuan Blair had 15 points, and Otto Porter and Brandon Beal added 13 each for the Wizards. \nScottie Wilbekin scored 21 points for the 76ers, who cut a 28-point deficit to five in the fourth quarter, but could get no closer. \nThe Wizards made their first eight shots and finished the first quarter shooting 84 percent. Washington led 69-45 at halftime and 99-71 after three quarters. \nSixers coach Brett Brown had just 11 of his 20 players available. No. 3 overall draft pick Jahlil Okafor did not play for the second straight game because of knee soreness and undrafted rookie Christian Wood was out with a sore hamstring. Isaiah Canaan and JaKarr Sampson were given the night off to rest and previously injured players, Tony Wroten, Kendall Marshall, Carl Landry, Nik Stauskas and Joel Embiid did not dress for the game. \nSIXERS: After playing together in the first two preseason games, Noel and Okafor were apart for the fourth straight game. Noel returned after missing the two previous games and Okafor missed his second straight on Friday night. \nIn splitting his time between power forward and center, Noel scored 15 points in 19 minutes. \nWIZARDS: In the first game of a back-to-back, the Wizards were without Nene Hilario (calf injury), Martell Webster (hip), Garrett Temple (hamstring), and Alan Anderson (ankle surgery). \nLEND A HAND: Wall got 10 of his assists in the first half in just 15 minutes of action. Meanwhile, the Sixers had 23 assists as a team on 38 field goals with 26 turnovers. \nON THE RECORD: Addressing a story that came out on Friday morning on Sports Illustrated's website detailing major concerns over the Sixers' rebuilding process, Brown cited inaccuracies and redundant material. \n\"When you read about portions that have been reported, there are portions that are wildly inaccurate,\" Brown said \nUP NEXT: Philadelphia visits Brooklyn for an afternoon game on Sunday. Washington returns to action on Saturday night at Milwaukee. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:50:46.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
