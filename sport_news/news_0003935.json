We’ve all been in different situations. That was pretty exciting. If there was a time for one, that would probably be it.”\nCrosby had a few moments like that, winning the Stanley Cup once and Olympic gold twice. In the 2010 Winter Games, Crosby scored the golden goal in overtime.\nCrosby also has no problem with baseball players celebrating every step along the way — from clinching a playoff berth to winning series by series. That’s in stark contrast to hockey’s tradition of celebrating nothing — not even touching the two conference trophies — until they win the Stanley Cup.\n“It’s fun for them,” Crosby said of baseball’s celebrations. “It’s all based on tradition and what you’re used to. I don’t have a problem with it. I’m sure it’d be weird for a (baseball) team not to celebrate.\n“I watched the game. I’d be celebrating if I were them, too. It was an incredible game.”\nMore on thestar.com\nKnow your enemy: 10 things about Kansas City\nWhy tennis star Eugenie Bouchard is suing the USTA", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:17:26.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
