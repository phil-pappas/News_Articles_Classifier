That's why we need a full explanation,\" he said.\nAnother regional chief, Matthias Schoeck, complained that he had only learned about the case from the media.\nEarlier this week, Niersbach categorically denied that there had been any slush funds or vote buying during the bid.\nBid committee leader Franz Beckenbauer said he never had money given to anyone to buy votes.\nNiersbach, who was also a senior member of the German bid committee, said Germany ran an honest bid.\n\"We conducted the bid with honest means, and ultimately decided (the contest) with honest means for us, for Germany, for German football on July 6, 2000 in Zurich,\" Niersbach said at an event at the German Football Museum in Dortmund on Monday.\nA federation panel is investigating the case, as well as an \"internationally respected\" law firm, but Niersbach could not say how long the probe would last.\nGerman prosecutors are examining whether there are grounds to open an investigation into the allegations.\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
