I really thought about it. \n“I’ve had a few medical issues this season. I’ve had some trouble with my heart. I’ve ended up getting an irregular heartbeat and I’ve been taking medication for it since I did my shoulder. \n“Having an irregular heartbeat takes 20 per cent of the oxygen out of your blood, so it’s been very tough for me physically and it has an effect mentally as well. \n“That’s the reason why I’ve been playing shorter minutes. (Coach) Brian McDermott and the club had an understanding and I don’t think I could do longer than the stints I was doing because of the implications.” \nLeuluai, who spent nine seasons at Leeds after time at NRL club Manly, said there were no implications for his long-term health.
