Charlie Woerner led all Rabun receivers with 5 catches for 61 yards and a score, while Tristan Huggins has two touchdown catches and Alden Wright one. Wright finished with four receptions for 53 yards, and Dillyn Nichols had 5 catches for 58 yards. \nMeanwhile, the Rabun defense held the visitors in check, allowing just 163 total yards, while snapping up three turnovers. \nThe Wildcats put the game away in the second quarter, scoring 29 unanswered points for a 36-3 halftime advantage. \nRabun County will close out the regular season on Nov. 6 against Greene County; they have a bye next week.
