For the first time since taking over at the start of the 2014 season, the coaching of Mike Pettine is being seriously questioned. Even when the Browns were ending the 2014 season on a five-game losing streak, Pettine received very little criticism. He was correctly viewed as a coach whose team had been crippled by injuries and then undercut by an ill-prepared Johnny Manziel taking over at quarterback for two games. Then there was Josh Gordon, who came back from his 10-game suspension seemingly uninterested in learning the plays or being serious about football.\n2. A year ago, Pettine improved the defense and was not blamed for the failures of the offense. His team finished 7-9, the Browns' best record since 2007. Most fans liked Pettine. They still seem to, but the collapse of the defense (ranked last) has him the target of some hard questions.\n3. After his team's 7-4 start last season, Pettine has watched his Browns lose eight of their last nine. That's why this is such a huge game. They were 1-3 in supposedly the easiest stretch of the schedule. The combined record of their first four opponents in 2014 was 18-46.\n4. The Browns are in Baltimore, where they haven't won since 2007. They are facing Joe Flacco, the tough quarterback who has a 13-1 record against them. They are lining up against a desperate foe with the same 1-3 record -- and knows its playoff hopes will take a severe hit at 1-4.\n5. Last year, Pettine's Browns crushed Pittsburgh, 31-10, at FirstEnergy Stadium. They beat the Bengals, 24-3, in Cincinnati. Those were two signature wins, but the Browns were still 2-4 in the AFC North. Last season, Pettine's team did show some ability to rise up and pull an upset. That has not been the case this season. Their lone victory is 28-14 over Tennessee at FirstEnergy.\n6. This also was a rough week for Pettine, who did a poor job handling the Joe Haden injury situation after the 30-27 loss to San Diego. As I wrote, he ended up apologizing to Haden and the entire team. The players seemed impressed that Pettine would publicly admit his mistake, and that could help morale. We'll see today.\n7. You know that Baltimore will run. The Ravens have Justin Forsett, who rushed for 119 yards the last time he saw orange helmets. He had 150 yards against Pittsburgh in his last game. Pettine is challenging his front seven to be ready, and the return of Desmond Bryant should help. The coaches have asked rookie tackle Danny Shelton to make an impact. The linebacker play has been very discouraging.\n8. Can Pettine and defensive coordinator Jim O'Neil close some of the obvious holes in their schemes? I'm sure that was a major topic of discussion in Berea this week. As I wrote in my weekend notes, they need to face the reality that right now the defense has been terrible. Something is very wrong.\n9. This will be an interesting game for Josh McCown. In his last two starts, he has thrown for 341 and 356 yards with 4 TDs and 1 interception. So he's been hot. Baltimore's defense is not the elite unit it once was, but the Ravens are still ranked 13th. Baltimore is a tough place to play because of all the crowd noise. Let's see if that leads to some false start penalties on offense.\n10. While McCown has played well (98.4 rating), he has yet to win a game after going 1-10 last year in Tampa. The 36-year-old veteran needs this victory on a personal level.\n11. Final thought: I expect the Browns to show some life, but I just can't find a way to pick them because the defense has been so poor: Ravens 27, Browns 20.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:23:06.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
