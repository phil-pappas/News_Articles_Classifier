From Wardha, in a pony- driven yakka on a dusty kutcha road, we reached Sewagram. Along with students from other states, we reported to Mahadev Desai, Gandhiji’s secretary. Only two students were to be selected. After a while, he came back and announced, “Gandhiji has chosen two medical students from Punjab.” Wounds of Bhagat Singh’s martyrdom were still fresh in every mind. The ashram was a well-planned cluster of huts with mud walls and thatched roofs, sprawling over acres. We were lodged in a barrack with 14 students. There were no charpoys. The most striking feature of the ashram was cleanliness and silence, even though everyone was very busy. ‘Living machines’ were operating noiselessly. In a 4 am-10 pm routine, in rotation, we swept roads, worked in the dairy, vegetable garden, lavatory, bath and linen washing block, kitchen, pantry, dining hall, office, sickroom — any and everywhere. Every day, dignitaries came to meet Gandhiji. Prominent among these were Seth Jamuna Lal Bajaj, Raj Kumari Amrit Kaur, Dr BC Roy and Dr Sushila Nayyar. The most colourful visitor was over six feet tall, Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, dressed in a long white kurta-salwar. He carried a small white bag on a stick across his shoulder, perhaps containing a spare attire. He came in a yakka, unlike others in cars, raising clouds of dust. Hundreds of villagers came to greet him, shouting ‘Frontier Gandhi zinda baad.’ Gandhiji sent him to Bihar on a mission. A week over, we went to pay obeisance to Gandhiji. Ved asked him, “May I join the army?” Chuckling, Gandhiji said, “In South Africa, as a stretcher-bearer in uniform, I lifted the wounded and the dead, both our own as well as the enemy, from the battlefield. As a doctor, you may join the army.” I asked him, “Bapu, why did you not have the ashram at Wardha?” Bapu stopped, held his stick with both hands, looked at me with his deep piercing eyes — as if I had touched his soul — and said, “Because Sewagram is real India and 80 per cent Indians live in villages. As a doctor, work for rural India.” During the last three decades, I established over 25 rural and slum healthcare centres. Every time I pictured Bapu whispering into my soul, “Not enough, do more.” In those days, 40 per cent of India, mostly rural, was below poverty line. Seven decades later, it is nearly the same, in spite of the 7-8 per cent annual growth rate. Top 20 per cent are reaping the fruits of growth while 50 per cent rural Indians still ease in the open. On an average, one farmer every day is giving up his life due to debt blues. With lessons in upright lifestyle, dignity of labour, community living, we bade goodbye at dawn to the ashram, listening to the pre-Quit India song on the loudspeaker, “Uthh jaag musaafir bhor bhai/teri gathri ko laaga chor bhai.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:08:46.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
