They ran a trick play, they rolled the dice and they hit the jackpot. Never seen it in college football.\"\nThe play began as an innocuous as they come; one of seven punts the Ducks (2-2, 0-1 Pac-12) would kick in their worst home loss since 1977. From his own 35-yard line, punter Ian Wheeler booted his kick down the left sideline to the Utah 31, where Boobie Hobbs stood waiting in front of the Oregon bench after peeling off from his assignment jamming a UO \"gunner.\"\nProblem was, the rest of Oregon's coverage team followed instructions and ran toward the right sideline, where returner Britain Covey had baited everyone but Wheeler, who could follow the flight of his ball, and one other coverage man.\nCovey even faked out Fox's camera operator.\nHobbs' eventual touchdown went for 69 yards to give Utah a 55-13 lead, the first punt returned for a score against the Ducks since Nov. 15, 2007.\n\"I could see (Hobbs) bail before the snap of the ball but what was he bailing for?\" Osborne said. \"I thought he was bailing for a throwback to him but how are those guys on the field supposed to know that? They can't hear anything if you're yelling out there, it's too loud. It's a trick play that was executed perfectly and the ball was kicked right to the guy, what can you say.\n\"They can't hear you on the field. We're screaming things all the time on the field and they can't hear it.\"\nHobbs' touchdown was not the only special teams gaffe of the night — Utah punter Tom Hackett, later named the Pac-12's special teamer of the week, rushed for 33 yards on fourth-and-13, and Bralon Addison lost a punt in the sun, which led to a 76-yard Hackett punt — which brings the typically spotless unit into the spotlight Saturday when UO travels to Colorado (3-1, 0-0).\nHackett said P12 POTW just means no returner did something special. On Hobbs: \"Boobie was all by him-bloody-self. I could have done that.\"\n— Matthew Piper (@matthew_piper) September 28, 2015\nByron Marshall, who is \"week-to-week\" after injuring a leg during a kick return against Utah, will not play, which hurts UO's production as his 27.5 yards per return were 18th-most nationally. Charles Nelson is listed on the depth chart as his kickoff replacement, alongside usual returner Bralon Addison.\nRunning back Tony Brooks-James, corner Ugo Amadi, all-purpose back Kirk Merritt and receiver Devon Allen also are in the rotation to receive kicks if needed, Osborne said.\nAmong FBS teams, Colorado's highest-ranked special teams unit is kick return, where its 27.8-yard average ranks 14th-best nationally. The Ducks, by comparison, have not allowed a touchdown on a kick return since 2006.\nThe Buffaloes have averaged just 4.4 yards on punts, but rankings can be a misnomer — Utah's punt return unit ranked just 61st, too, before its fake-out of the Ducks.\nThis weekend, Osborne would prefer to heap the credit on his team.\n\"Our punt coverage is great,\" Osborne said. 'That's a frickin' awesome play right there. That was an awesome play. Give them credit.\"\nHere are today's links:\nHow is UO trying to find answers? By making everything simpler.\nMarshall is \"week-to-week,\" while CB Chris Seisay is in \"another boat.\"\nOregon's lineup should get shuffled without Marshall at wide receiver.\nHave a free 20 minutes today?
