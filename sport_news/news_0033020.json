Now I want to keep going the same way.”\nMartinez should get another chance to add to his tally in Atletico’s next outing, a La Liga clash at home to fellow Champions League participants Valencia on Sunday.\nAtletico coach Diego Simeone has been keen to protect his expensive new recruit from criticism and said the reaction of the other players to his goal showed Martinez had their backing.\n“The position of forward is different to the others,” Simeone told a news conference. “You can see how pleased the team were from the television pictures.\n“This makes us very happy because it demonstrates the group’s support for the player which will without doubt give him confidence and security in himself.”\nAtletico’s victory at the Calderon put the 2014 runners-up level on six points at the top of the group with Benfica, who were beaten 2-1 at Galatasaray.\nThe Turkish club have four points in third, with Astana on one point in fourth and last place.\nAtletico travel to play Astana on Nov. 3, when Benfica host Galatasaray.\n 23, 2015 6:52 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T02:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:16:45.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
