SUNRISE, Fla. â€” Jaromir Jagr scored twice in the first period and added an assist to lead the Florida Panthers to a 3-2 victory over the Buffalo Sabres on Thursday night. The 43-year-old Jagr stayed hot with his third and fourth goals of the season and continues to climb the all-time leader board in scoring. Linemate Aleksander Barkov had a goal and an assist. Rookie defenseman Jake McCabe scored for Buffalo on assists by Marcus Foligno and Nicolas Deslauriers. Tyler Ennis scored on assists from Ryan O'Reilly and Rasmus Ristolainen. Florida goaltender Roberto Luongo made 24 saves for his 403rd career victory, tying him with Grant Fuhr for ninth in all-time wins. Luongo holds a seven-game winning streak over the Sabres (1-3-0). Florida entered the game with 11 goals in their first three games - the best offensive start in team history. As they did in their home opener, the Panthers relied on special teams early and late, taking advantage of a 5-on-3 power play less than eight minutes into the game after Buffalo's Mike Weber and Josh Gorges were sent off for minor penalties. Barkov skated in from the left and lifted a pass over a sliding defenseman and through the crease. Jagr then connected with a one-timer past Buffalo goaltender Chad Johnson from the bottom of the right circle at 8:52. It was the 205th power-play goal of Jagr's career, tying him for 13th place all time with Joe Sakic. A section of glass was dislodged by a check in Florida's zone with 2:53 left in the first period. Officials decided to send both clubs off for a full intermission while repairs were made. Jagr returned after the break and again scored from the right circle with 2:26 left in the first for his fourth goal of the year - all at home. Jagr's shot on the power play early in the third period was slapped past Johnson by Barkov on the rebound for his second goal at 4:24 to again give Florida a two-goal edge. McCabe scored his first career goal when he tapped in a shot past Luongo at 7:10 to cut Florida's lead to 2-1. Ennis's power-play goal on a slapshot from above the right circle made it 3-2 12:35 into the third period. Buffalo rookie forward Jack Eichel, returning to the arena for the first time since being picked No. 2 overall in the June draft, was held off the scoresheet.
