That could prove valuable to the Maple Leafs now that the league has established that signing a head coach from another organization could garner the team losing the asset a second- or third-round pick. The Leafs, by the way, owe the Red Wings a third-round pick for Babcock. A look at some of Babcock’s successful assistants.\nPaul MacLean: Babcock’s assistant for eight years, from the start in Anaheim in 2002-03 and in Detroit until 2011 when he left to take over the Ottawa Senators for three-and-a-half seasons. He won the Jack Adams award for the 2011-12 season. MacLean was up for the Leafs job and considered a front-runner if Babcock didn’t take it.\nTodd McLellan: Babcock’s assistant in Detroit for three years starting in 2005-06. He took over as head coach of the San Jose Sharks, where he made the playoffs for the first six years. When he missed last year — for the first time — he left the Sharks and took over the Edmonton Oilers. He coached Team Canada to gold at the world championships in spring.\nJeff Blashill: Babcock’s assistant in Detroit for one season (2011-12). He worked closely with Babcock as well when he took over the Wings’ top farm system in Grand Rapids. When Babcock left for the Leafs, the line of ascension was clear and Blashill will now coach the Red Wings. Blashill’s Griffins won the Calder Trophy in 2012-13.\nBrad McCrimmon: A bright future awaited McCrimmon in coaching before the plane he was on crashed killing him and most of the players on Yaroslavl Lokomotiv in September of 2011. It was McCrimmon’s first head coaching gig after three years with Babcock as an assistant. The long-time NHLer had previously been an assistant coach in Calgary and Atlanta.\nHonorable mentions: Babcock coached future coaches in Dan Bylsma (a defenceman in Anaheim), Adam Oates (a forward in Anaheim) and future Leaf president Brendan Shanahan (a forward in Detroit).\nMore on thestar.com\nRecord-breaking Burris leads Redblacks to their biggest win\nRaptors prospect Powell willing to outwait his doubters", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:04:27.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
