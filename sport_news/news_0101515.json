The win, coupled with a bye week, will give the Cougars a needed break before traveling to San Jose.\nUpcoming Games BYU Football BYU BYU @ SJ State Spartan Stadium, San Jose Nov. 6, 9:30 p.m. 13 Days 3 Hrs 25 Mins 54 Secs More Coverage Playing BYU a bittersweet experience for Wagner players and coaches BYU football cruises to 70-6 victory over winless Wagner PROVO — It was Nate's Gate.\nThird-string walk-on running back Nate Carter rushed for 102 yards and a 70-yard touchdown Saturday in BYU ’s 70-6 win over Wagner. It was a career day for the guy from St. George.\nThat places some perspective on the day the Cougars had over an overmatched Northeast Conference foe from Staten Island, New York that had lost to Colgate and St. Francis and left BYU 0-7.\n“I think our players handled this week and this game as well as could be expected,” said Bronco Mendenhall, whose team reached bowl eligibility with a 6-2 record heading into a bye week before traveling to San Jose State in two weeks.\nThis was a game that did need to be managed amidst a certain win.\nFirst, Tanner Mangum played and didn’t get hurt.\nSecond, Cougar running back Algernon Brown also avoided injury except for a cut after colliding with a celebration cannon near the north end zone after a TD run. It was the only object that got in his way all day.\nThird, BYU didn’t lose any linemen, which was key since starting offensive linemen Ryker Matthews, Kyle Johnson and Ului Lapuaho all sat out the game with various ailments.\nFourth, Mangum’s backup, freshman Beau Hoge, got his first game snaps and connected with David Kessler for a 47-yard third quarter touchdown play. Koy Detmer then made his debut with a minute left in the third quarter.\nFifth, it was a stat feeder. The 70 points was the most scored by BYU since Gary Crowton’s first game as Cougar coach in 2001 against Tulane.\nFor me, analysis of this kind of game is a mystery. One big takeaway was how mobile Mangum looked in the brief workout he got during his 12 passes.\nPlenty of FBS teams load up these kinds of cupcake games, guaranteed wins, confidence boosters, stat builders. Thing is, most all of these come the first or second week in September, not midseason like BYU found in Wagner on Saturday.\nYou may peruse the log of many Power 5 teams and find gaudy numbers posted against FBC opponents, or struggling FBS teams looking to make a paycheck. Most times it’s a laugher but you may remember Washington State lost to the Big Sky’s Portland State 24-17 and Utah State got all it wanted from Southern Utah before etching out a 12-9 win eight weeks ago.\nObscene numbers were posted by Oregon in a 61-28 win over Georgia State. Ditto for Arizona’s 77-13 thrashing of Northern Arizona, the Cal Bears’ 73-14 demolishing of Grambling, Colorado’s 48-0 win over Nicholls State, USC ’s 59-9 win over Idaho and Washington’s 49-0 shutout of Sacramento. The SEC isn’t immune from partaking. Remember last month when Mississippi State crushed Northwestern State 62-13, or Missouri’s 34-3 drama over Southeast Missouri and Ole Miss spanking the University of Tennessee at Martin 76-3?\nAll those records count. So do all the statistics that go into total offense, total defense, QB numbers, et cetera and et cetera.\nThis is the case for the Cougars, who build up a 6-2 record the hard way, with road games at Nebraska, UCLA and Michigan as primers. This sixth win makes the Cougars bowl eligible and win six did not come a year ago until Nov. 15, a victory over UNLV .\nWhat are those numbers? Tanner Mangum left the game with just over nine minutes left in the second quarter against Wagner. He improved his season and career touchdowns passes from 12 to 15. He finished the day 12 of 13 for 237 yards and a pair of TD passes, to Mitch Matthews and Colby Pearson.\nAlgernon Brown carried just six times to get 109 yards, good for two touchdowns and an 18.2-yard average. It was the first time BYU had rushed for more than 200 yards since Savannah State a year ago.\nThe Cougars came into the game averaging 414 yards of total offense (59th) and gained 741. Their average per game of 414 climbed to 454.8. BYU’s defense was allowing 392 yards per game (88th). Wagner gained just 112 and that dropped the Cougar season’s total defense average allowed yards from 392 to 357.1.\nThe biggest statistical adjustment in BYU’s season statistics will be in rushing per game. Before Wagner, it was 136.1 (103rd) but after 330 yards gained Saturday that jumps to 160 per game.\n“Now, we get a great chance to get more rested and healthy, which has been a long time coming. It’s time we can do some self-scouting now and heal up,” said Mendenhall.\nOh, and the 56,015 in attendance at LaVell Edwards Stadium? It was more than the average attendance this year of 10 Pac-12 football programs.\nCredit Cougar fans: They knew this was what they’d get.\nEMAIL: dharmon@deseretnews.com .\nTWITTER: Harmonwrites", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team33.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team91.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-players.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/players/player34556.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-players.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/players/player46007.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team108.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team71.html"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:06:42.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
