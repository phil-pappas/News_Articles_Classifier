October 9th 2015 26 minutes ago /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/Motor Sport/V8/ \nREIGNING Bathurst 1000 champion Chaz Mostert has broken his left leg and wrist in a horrific crash between the famous Mount Panorama Dipper and Forrest’s Elbow during qualifying for the Bathurst 1000. \nMostert has been air-lifted to hispital in Orange and all track action has been suspended for the day while his Prodrive Racing Australia Ford Falcon is removed from the track and the flag marshal’s hut repaired. \nMostert clipped a concrete wall with the front left of his car, sending the right hand side of his car into the opposite wall. \nThe car then once again mounted the left hand wall, sliding along it at high speed and wiping the roof off a track marshals hut before landing on the road at Forrest’s Elbow. \nMostert was taken away from the scene in an ambulance as the session was temporarily red flagged. \nThe incident ripped doors, wheels and other panels off the #6 Falcon, with his participation in Sunday’s 1000km endurance classic now highly unlikely.
