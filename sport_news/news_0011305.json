Dante Chrcek, Marysville: And here’s the thunder. Chrcek was a complementary piece a year ago, while this year he’s joined Ellul as a co-centerpiece. A fullback in every sense of the word, Chrcek can be seen every Friday night carrying defenders for large chunks of yardage.</p> (Photo: JEFFREY M.

If all three win their home games on Friday, they all get to throw a joint parade and celebrate a three-way tie for the conference crown. \nOf course, this means there are three teams that will try to play spoiler. Marine City will host Warren Woods-Tower (0-4 MAC Gold, 1-6 overall). Marysville will welcome St. Clair (1-3, 3-4) to Vikings Country. Sterling Heights will greet Port Huron Northern (2-2, 4-3). \nNorthern is that fourth team that can still win a share of the title, but they’ll need plenty of help. Step one for the Huskies is to beat Sterling Heights. If they top the Stallions and Marysville and Marine City also fall, it will be a four-way tie as they will all have 3-2 conference records. \nBasically, it’s going to be a wild night. \nThe games also hold state playoff implications as Marysville and Sterling Heights can lock up a postseason spot with a win. Northern and Marine City need to win their last two games to guarantee a playoff berth, so essentially their playoff mentality is already there. \nAlgonac's AJ Garshott tosses the ball during a football game Friday, October 2, 2015 at Croswell-Lexington High School.

Raise your hand if you’re not from Algonac and predicted that before the season. \nThe Muskrats are the league's only unbeaten team, as they are 6-0 in league play (7-0 overall), and have a one-game lead on Richmond and Almont. \nSo the easy ending here is Algonac wins in Week 8, and walks away outright BWAC champion. But Richmond would rather it doesn’t go the easy way, because the Blue Devils are the team standing between the Muskrats and BWAC perfection. A Richmond win – at home, mind you – makes for a shared league title, at least between Algonac and Richmond. \nAlmont can also get in on a shared title with a win against Croswell-Lexington. The Pioneers will be at home, however, and are one win away from wrapping up a playoff berth themselves. \n<p>4. Chase Tucker, Sandusky: As Sandusky rose from 1-3 to playoff team a year ago, Tucker burst onto the scene. As the leader of a powerful Sandusky rushing attack, he provides not only another tough running option, but also a big-play threat to the Redskins offense. He’s somehow been better this year, too.</p> (Photo: PAUL COSTANZO / Times Herald) \nGTC East \nSandusky has been the dominant team in the league this season, and a win Friday night against Memphis would wrap up an outright league championship. \nAnd let’s be realistic, a Memphis win would be one of the biggest upset in the state this year. Sandusky is 7-0 (4-0 in the GTC East), has won 12 straight regular season games, and has won all four of its league games by at least four touchdowns. Memphis is 0-4 in the league and 1-6 overall, and has scored 24 points total in four league games. \nIf the Yellowjackets were to pull it off, Ubly could still get in on the league title, as the Bearcats are 3-1 in league play, and will square off with Brown City. \nHunter Welsh (left) and Nathan Rosenthal compete in a drill at Peck football practice.

Both have also dominated league competition, as Peck is winning NCTL games by an average of 29.5 points per game, and Deckerville is winning by an average of 39.3. \nOne big difference, however, is that Peck is 4-0 in the league, and can win the title outright Friday. Deckerville, meanwhile, is 3-0 and can only clinch a share this week. If the Eagles win, they can clinch the title outright in Week 9 against Dryden. 40 CONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://bwne.ws/1RL0PXa TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:48:48.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
