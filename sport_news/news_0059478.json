LOUIS (AP) - Rookie Robby Fabbri scored the tiebreaking goal midway through the third period to help the St. Louis Blues beat Edmonton 3-1 Thursday night, spoiling Oilers rookie Connor McDavid's NHL debut.\nVladimir Tarasenko had the tying goal for the Blues near the midpoint of the second period, and Troy Brouwer added an empty-netter with 18 seconds remaining in the third. Brian Elliott finished with 23 saves.\nRyan Nugent-Hopkins scored in the first period for Edmonton and Cam Talbot had 28 saves.\nMcDavid, the No. 1 overall pick in this year's draft, took 22 shifts, played 18:07 and was on the ice for Brouwer's goal. He had two shots on goal, and struggled on faceoffs - winning only three of 13.\nFabbri, a 19-year-old forward - and McDavid's childhood friend - was also playing in his first NHL game. The Blues' first-round pick in 2014 was one of three rookies in the St. Louis lineup, joining defensemen Colton Parayko and Joel Edmundson.\nNugent-Hopkins gave the Oilers a 1-0 lead late in the first period with a fluke power-play goal. He lost a face-off but when Blues defenseman Alex Pietrangelo tried to clear the puck it bounced off Alexander Steen and past Brian Elliott. Nugent-Hopkins was credited with the unassisted power-play goal with 2:38 remaining in the period.\nTarasenko tied it a 9:10 of the second after getting loose on a breakaway with a stretch pass from Alex Pietrangelo and beating Talbot through his legs.\nTarasenko, who signed an eight-year, $60 million extension in the offseason, was the last Blues player to score in his debut.\nNOTES: McDavid and F Anton Slepyshev made their NHL debuts for the Oilers. ... St. Louis Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina dropped the ceremonial first puck. ... The attendance was announced as standing room-only 19,327.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:17:38.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
