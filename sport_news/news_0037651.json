The Mountaineers got on the board first when a Robert Wilson header found the back of the net off a Steven Beaudry pass just 4:21 into the game. The rest of the half belonged to Wolves goalkeeper Josh Fry, who aggressively defended the home goal with seven saves for the half, earning him the nickname “The Wall” from the vocal WWU crowd. The second half brought three more goals from EOU players, as Alex Gutierrez (51:49) took an assist from Uriel Torres-Carrillo, and then two unassisted goals by Fredy Rodriguez (52:24) and Osvaldo Martinez (65:23) found the net. Eastern Oregon’s defense allowed three shots on goal by Walla Walla’s players, but Edwin Munoz made his one shot count by scoring the Wolves’ only goal of the night at the 88:45 mark. The Wolves (0-8 overall, 0-8 in CCC play) travel to Corban and Northwest Christian Friday and Saturday.
