I was a little bit disappointed. ‘I said, look, I’m going to fight again and see what happens.’ I found my game again,” said Muguruza. \nKvitova fell to this year’s shock finalist at the US Open, Roberta Vinci of Italy, in two sets. The double Wimbledon champion got off to a strong start, establishing a 4-0 lead over Vinci. \nBut the Italian clawed back, taking the first set in a tie break, and Kvitova struggled in the second — eventually losing on a break of serve. \n“I think she’s playing with a lot of confidence right now after such a big win against Serena (Williams), playing the (US Open) final,” Kvitova said of Vinci, who returned to the top 20 after her performance at Flushing Meadows. \nThe Czech was diagnosed with glandular fever this year but has continued to compete, and looked tired as she walked off court. She said she would now travel to Beijing for next week’s China Open, the final tournament before the season finale in Singapore. \nVenus Williams took just two sets to dismiss Carla Suarez Navarro of Spain 6-3, 6-4 — potentially setting her up to meet her sister Serena’s US Open nemesis Vinci in the semis, if they both make it through the quarterfinals. \nKonta, who came into the Wuhan tournament 66th in the rankings, stormed back to win the last six games of the third set and will face Venus in the quarterfinals. \n“It was two hours and 17 minutes of very, very tough tennis for me,” Konta said. “Simona really played some unbelievable tennis in parts — she may not be feeling her best — but I’m just really happy I was able to take a few of the chances I created.” \nIn Shenzhen, sixth-seeded Jiri Vesely advanced to the quarterfinals of the Shenzhen Open by beating Zhizhen Zhang of China 6-2, 6-3. \nThe Czech player conceded only 10 points on his serve. \nVesely will next face top-seeded Tomas Berdych, who defeated Austin Krajicek of the United States 7-5, 6-3. \nSimone Bolelli of Italy qualified for his seventh quarterfinal match of the season after eighth-seeded Victor Estrella Burgos retired with a back injury while trailing 6-4, 4-0. Tommy Robredo will face Bolelli in the quarterfinals after eliminating Hiroki Moriya of Japan 7-5, 6-3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:39:57.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
