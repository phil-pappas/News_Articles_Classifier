There will be suggestions his age ought to force a retirement. \nBut this is a man enjoying the form of his life and doubtless hell-bent on one last career experience to weave into one of the richest rugby tapestries around. \nA statesman as skilled in second-row skulduggery as ambassadorial duty, O'Connell deserves so much more than to go out pounding the turf in anguish and agony. \nLet's hope he can still make it for that Indian summer in Toulon.
