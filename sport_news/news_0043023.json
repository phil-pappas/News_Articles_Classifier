At quarterback alone, K-State is without Jesse Ertz (knee), Alex Delton (knee) and Jonathan Banks (sickness). Kicker Matthew McCrane has been out since Week 2 (leg) and senior safety Dante Barnett has been out since the season opener (shoulder). \nJust last week at Oklahoma State, the Wildcats lost wide receiver Kody Cook to a shoulder injury. He entered the game as the fifth-string quarterback after Joe Hubener left briefly following a hit to the head. \n“It’s been a wild roller-coaster ride as far as the quarterbacks,” said Hubener, who had made three starts this season. “It’s a testament to the type of guys we have. Kody Cook is as good an athlete as anybody and he was able to step in and fill those shoes and do a tremendous job. \n“Kody is so versatile. He can really do it all. I wouldn’t be surprised if we see him take some snaps at quarterback still.” \nSenior cornerback Morgan Burns and receiver Dominique Heath also left last week’s game with injuries and did not return. Their status for this week is uncertain. \nHubener is expected to start this Saturday, but redshirt freshman Zach Davidson will likely be his backup — the sixth QB on the depth chart if you’re keeping track — and the only one without a bio in the team’s official media guide. \n“Zach is preparing as hard as anybody,” Hubener said. “He’s studying in the film room, he’s working hard in practice like everybody else. I think he has his mindset that if it happens that he has to come in, he’s going to be ready.” \nSnyder said this week he wasn’t sure if he’s ever seen a rash of injuries like this before. \n“I don’t know if it’s happened any place, but we’ve certainly set the standard for it, haven’t we?” he said. \nThough K-State has been fortunate to have quality talent step up — including Jack Cantele at kicker, Nate Jackson at safety and Hubener and Cook at quarterback — some of the more recent injuries could force the coaching staff to remove redshirts from players, perhaps as soon as this week with TCU (5-0, 2-0) in town. \nThe most dire need could come from the secondary if Burns’ injury turns into something more long term. Making matters worse for the Wildcats was the arrest of backup cornerback Cre Moore early last Sunday morning, which likely takes him out of the equation for some time now as well. \n“We’ve worked a number of young guys that are freshmen — first-year freshmen — into our team periods,” Snyder said. “So, consequently, we’ve prepared guys if indeed we were to have some of the issues that we are having right now. It’s certainly a possibility. We have a number of guys on both sides of the ball prepared, if we have to.” \nThe most obvious to fill a hole on the defensive side could be freshman Duke Shelley, a four-star cornerback from Tucker, Ga. On offense, if Heath and Cook’s injuries persist, freshmen Denzel Goolsby and Isaiah Zuber could be candidates to join the fold. Goolsby was a standout at Wichita’s Bishop Carroll. \nCOOK IMPRESSES — NOW WHAT? \nIt’s anyone’s guess how long Cook will be sidelined after leaving the game in the fourth quarter last Saturday at Oklahoma State. \nThe receiver-turned-quarterback fell hard on his right shoulder following a dazzling 32-yard run, ending what seemed like an unlikely and improbable day of events for the former walk-on and fill-in QB from Louisburg. \nCook only went into the game at quarterback after Hubener left with an apparent head injury. Then Cook took over, completing 10-of-16 passes for 122 yards and two touchdowns, to go along with 87 rushing yards and another score in basically three quarters. \n“I thought he prepared well, played extremely well,” Snyder said. “I liked his poise and nothing seemed to get to him. I don’t think he was nervous by it. He would probably tell that he was. \n“I thought he was quite poised in the ballgame and had a very fine command of what the offense does.” \nCook, who worked at quarterback during his redshirt year in 2013, began taking snaps last week once Banks went down with a reportedly case of mononucleosis. \n“I know everyone was watching it and thinking it was crazy that this receiver was throwing the ball,” K-State lineman Terrale Johnson said. “I knew what he could do and after the reps that he was taking, it wasn’t a surprise to us that he was going to go out there and shine like that. He’s an athlete and he competes hard.” \nBut it was short-lived, as he too went down with an injury, forcing Hubener to check back into the game after passing a series of concussion tests on the sideline following his hit in the first quarter. \n“Once I got to the sideline, the doctor came over to me and asked exactly what happened on the play,” Hubener said. “I spit that back to him and gave him the play call. He asked me what quarter it was and where I was at, gave me five objects I had to remember and repeat those back to him. Then he gave me groups of four numbers at a time that I was supposed to repeat backwards and he gave me several sets of those, then he asked me what the five set of objects were again and I repeated those back. He made me say the months backwards. \n“He did the same thing over again with a new set of objects and new sets of numbers and said everything seemed good. Then they made me do some agilities to make sure I was moving like I should. Everything was good.” \nAnd Hubener nearly led the Wildcats to the victory, scoring on a fourth-down run in the fourth quarter to give K-State a late lead before Oklahoma State’s eventual game-winning 37-yard field goal in the final minute. \n“I was proud of Joe for being able to come back,” Snyder said. “And I was proud of him because he’s a team player and he was invested in what Kody was doing and he was trying to help Kody during his time in there, and when he came he was ready. He maintained his poise. He didn’t skip a beat.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:17:10.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
