Led by a 3-over par 75 from Natalie Mullins, the College of Idaho holds the overall lead into today’s final round. The Lady Yotes carded a season best team score of 315, four shots ahead of Rocky Mountain (319). Both Oregon Tech (326) and Corban (329) are still in the hunt, with Warner Pacific (387) in fifth. Walla Walla Community College didn’t field a complete team, with Korbie Jenks shooting a 97 and Marisa Jimenez a 105. “Lauren again finished sluggishly after plenty of good golf early,” WWCC coach Mike Rostollan said. “I know the next couple of weeks we’ll be focusing on techniques she might use to close out her rounds a little more strongly. “Marisa and Korbie are settling into big-time college golf and show improvement, and that doesn’t always show up in the scorecard,” he said. “While Korbie bettered her last week’s day-one effort, she knows she can do put up lower numbers.” College of Idaho was paced by Mullins, the two-time Cascade Conference Player of the Week, sitting one shot behind overall leader Kyla Clancy of Rocky , last week’s winner at the Warner Pacific Invitational. The second round began with a shotgun start this morning.
