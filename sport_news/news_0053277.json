The Rams hinder themselves. \nMountain West play begins for Colorado State University on Saturday with a three-game stretch against Utah State, Boise State and Air Force that will decide if the Rams can claim a 2015 conference title. All of those teams are beatable. The only question is whether the Rams will be mentally tough enough to not beat themselves like they did against Minnesota and the University of Colorado. \nUntimely penalties, missed field goals and the allowance of late big plays have been CSU’s downfall in its first four games under coach Mike Bobo. The Rams (2-2, 0-0 MW) can’t allow any of that Saturday if they hope to knock off Utah State (1-2, 0-0) on the road. \nHidden yardage of field position \nSaturday won’t be a high-scoring affair. CSU has the third most potent scoring offense in the Mountain West, but Utah State will gladly counter with the conference’s third-best defense. Plus, everyone knows the Aggies are blinded by the sight of the end zone. \nAs cliche as it sounds, the Rams are going to have to take what Utah State’s defense gives them and not try to do more. Linebackers Nick Vigil and Kyler Fackrell are two of the conference’s best (Fackrell was the preseason Mountain West Defensive Player of the Year) and rarely yield and extra yard to a begging opponent; don’t expect Saturday to be any different. \nWith that in mind, CSU is going to need to lean on kick returner Deionte Gaines and punter Hayden Hunt to be its game changers, giving its offense less of a field to traverse and pinning the Aggies deep. \nGaines ranks fourth in the Mountain West in kickoff returns, averaging 26.71 yards, with runs of 51 and 38 yards in the past two weeks. Hunt is averaging 48.94 yards per punt, the good for fourth in the nation, and can flip field position in one swift swing of his leg. \nMAKE YOUR FIELD GOALS! \nYou’ve heard this one before. \nCSU’s struggles in the kicking game are no secret with Freshman Wyatt Bryan connecting of 5 of 9 attempts this season, a 55.6 percent conversion rate that ranks 88th in the nation. To his credit, protection was lacking in his try that was blocked in overtime against CU and the kick was blocked, but he was 1 of 4 in that game, including a makeable 47 yarder. \nThe last time CSU visited Logan was the last time it was shutout; a 13-0 defeat. In that game, even clutch kicker Jared Roberts missed a 24-yard field goal. \nCoach Mike Bobo wants his offense to stop stalling and settling for field goals. In a defensive battle against Utah State, field goals will likely be the difference. Bryan can’t afford to miss. \nAir it out \nGone are Kapri Bibbs and Dee Hart. Two of the greatest running backs CSU has had since the turn of the century weren’t able to make headway against Utah State (Rams have rushed for 108 total yards in their last two meetings with the Aggies), why will Saturday be any different? \nCSU will attempt to finally break off a long run against the Aggies with Dalyn Dawkins and Jasen Oden and take advantage of offensive coordinator Will Friend’s new perspective from the booth. Maybe it will work. Probably not. That’s not an insult to Oden and Dawkins — Utah State’s defense is just that good. \nUtah State has the nation’s 23rd-ranked rushing defense, limiting opponents to 107 yards per game. If there’s one area Utah State is weak in (and “weak” is relative), it’s against the pass, allowing an average of 203.7 yards. \nQuarterback Nick Stevens has taken criticism for his play over the last three weeks (55.8 percent completion rate, 588 yards, four touchdowns, two interceptions). If there was ever a time to silence the haters, it’s now. Rely on the sure-handed Rashard Higgins and tight ends to move the ball down field. \nFor insight and analysis on athletics around Northern Colorado and the Mountain West, follow sports columnist Matt L.
