In the end, the Eagles woukd swarm J.Y.O. for a 60-44 win.J.Y.O. inched up 4-0 as Rashond Salnave scored a floater.

With 3:26 left in regulation, J.Y.O. was in an enormous 52-36 hole with time running out quick, fast and in a hurry.J.Y.O. kept fighting but frustration set in as Walker got ejected due to flagrant foul.
