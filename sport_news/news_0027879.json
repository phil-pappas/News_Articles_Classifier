Friday night will mark the first time the Cougars and Bearcats have met, but in order to find their most recent common opponent we don't have to go too far. \nThe last team that both BYU and Cincinnati played was the Memphis Tigers, and neither game turned out well for the Tigers' opponent. \nWe all remember the \"Miami Beach Brawl\" from last year when BYU lost to Memphis in double overtime 55-48. We may not remember the game, but we do remember the extra curricula that followed once time expired. \nThe Bearcats met the Tigers in Memphis on Sept. 24, and Cincinnati lost that shootout 46-53. \nHere's what we can learn about Friday night's game from BYU's and Cincinnati's matchups with Memphis. Defense gives up too many points \nBYU and Cincinnati gave up a total of 108 points to Memphis. Both defenses let Memphis quarterback Paxton Lynch throw for 306 yards (BYU), and 412 yards (Cincinnati). \nBoth BYU and Cincinnati have been giving up a lot of points on offense, and both quarterbacks have thrown over 1,000 yards this season, and both teams know how to get into the end zone. Well, except when BYU plays Michigan. \nWhat all of this tells us is what we already knew, and that's the fact it will probably be a shootout Friday night in Provo. Kai Nacua (12) makes an interception and runs it back for a touchdown as BYU and Boise State play Saturday, Sept. 12, 2015, at LaVell Edwards Stadium in Provo. BYU won 35-24. (Scott G Winterton/Deseret News) Interceptions \nWhen BYU faced Memphis in the Miami Beach Bowl, the Cougars picked off Lynch three times. When Cincy met the Tigers in September, the Bearcats came up with a zero in the INT column against Lynch. \nGranted Lynch has grown and improved since then, but it's a trend that's continued this year. \nFor 2015, Cincinnati has only two interceptions on the year. BYU already has 10 on the season. BYU's quarterback has thrown nine interceptions, and Cincinnati's two quarterbacks this season have combined for 10, five apiece. If the Bearcats continue to sling the ball around like they've been known to do, the BYU secondary may have a few opportunities. \nSame goes for the Bearcat secondary against Tanner Mangum, but the stats say that may fall in BYU's favor. Conclusion \nFor a game that's a first-ever meeting for these programs, there's a fair amount of history. \nFriday night should make for an interesting and entertaining game with lots of touchdowns and maybe a last-second finish the BYU faithful have become accustomed to. \nJohn has been writing about movies, news, sports and pretty much anything awesome for more than five years.
