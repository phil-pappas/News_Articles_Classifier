(Photo: Henrietta Wildsmith/The Times, Henrietta Wildsmith/The Times) \nMike Fitzwater stood before a packed Calvary Baptist Church on Wednesday and delivered a confident message through immense pain. Four days prior, the life of his son, Daniel, a ULM quarterback, was cut mind-bogglingly short at the age of 20. \nIn spite of the hurt and immeasurable void the Fitzwater family is left to battle in the wake of the stunning death, Mike Fitzwater is left with a sense of peace. \n“He was a total joy as a son and I loved him so much,” Mike said during his son’s stirring memorial service. “My wife, Kelli, and the whole family takes great comfort in knowing none of this came as a surprise to God. Daniel’s days were written in his book and planned out before a single day of his life began.” \nFrom Amarillo and Liberty, Texas, to Shreveport, Monroe, Wesson, Mississippi, and many places in between Daniel Forrest Fitzwater was a nomad of sorts, but his travels were far from aimless. Many of the moves came as part of the family, while others came with the life of a being a quarterback. \nWherever Fitzwater took shelter, he quickly took roots and had a purpose.

Not only did Fitzwater produce a Calvary-record 46 touchdowns and capture The Times’ 2012 All-City quarterback honor, the 6-foot-5, 233-pounder who wore No. 15 garnered immediate respect. \nSeveral former Cavaliers teammates converged in Shreveport for the service administered by former Calvary athletic director Johnny Booty \n“That’s when you know you’re a champion – ring or not,” said Calvary head coach John Bachman, whose team will wear “DF 15” decals on its helmets for the rest of this season. \nFormer Cavaliers and current Air Force star Weston Steelhammer flew back Tuesday night and is expected to head out Thursday morning. \n“All the pickup basketball games we played -- those memories will last forever,” Steelhammer said. “We always found a way not to be on each other’s team. We wanted to beat each other. All the guys can attest to how competitive he was.” ULM, ex-Calvary QB Fitzwater remembered as ‘role model’ \nDuring Wednesday’s service, Ron Lynch, a quarterback coach and member of the “Covenant of Men” Fitzwater entered in May of 2013, passed along a memory of Fitzwater taking his grandson under his wing and the little boy once telling his grandfather, “I want to be just like Daniel.” \nHead coach Glenn Davis and many of Fitzwater’s teammates during his two-year stint at Copiah-Lincoln Community College in Wesson, as well as members of Liberty High School, Fitzwater’s home before Calvary, were in attendance. \n“I’ll never forget meeting him for the first time,” Booty said. “I saw him unfold out of the backseat of that car. And he kept unfolding. He hit the field and I said, ‘This is Terry Bradshaw. This is Joe Ferguson.’ \n“He was a big, strapping guy, but we soon found we had something far-more amazing than a quarterback. He had a vibrant, living faith in mom and dad … he had it. He just had it.” \nFitzwater’s current teammates, the ULM Warhawks, appeared en masse Wednesday. \nULM head coach Todd Berry recruited Fitzwater out of high school and eventually welcomed him to the team as a walk-on this spring. \nAlthough he suffered a preseason knee injury and never saw the field, Fitzwater made his mark in Monroe. \n“Walk-on or not, the thing we want to leave this life with more than anything else, more than medals and awards, is knowing we made some kind of impact,” Berry said. “He did that.” \nFitzwater was found lifeless – “with a smile on his face” – by older sister Mikaela on Saturday morning in Ruston, just hours after watching his brothers David and Malachi play for Calvary in Farmerville. \n“Regardless of their stature and success, people respect others for who they are,” Berry said. “Daniel had a tremendous amount of respect on our football team – a great testimony to how he led his life. \n“I was asked if we can we honor him with a win. We can more honor him by trying to live our lives with the same kind of spirit he had. Rather than worrying about wins and losses, try to impact others. He was a great role model for all of us.” \nMichael Fitzwater’s poignant testimony included memories of a son once fascinated by balloons and school buses and a kid who wore a coon-skinned cap for three years and only removed it to bathe or swim. \nBefore he was captivated by football’s bright lights and the ability to lead others as a quarterback, Fitzwater’s first dream was to become the next Steve Irwin, “The Crocodile Hunter.” \n“He loved the color green, fishing and playing football,” Fitzwater said. “He had a passion for life, a passion for people.” \nAnd people had a passion for Fitzwater. ULM QB, Daniel Fitzwater, a Calvary product, dies \n“His whole family made an impact,” Steelhammer said. “We were the lucky ones to have him in our lives. It was such an awful event that took place, but being here today you get to see how many lives he actually touched in the short 20 years he lived. I’m grateful and honored to be his friend.” \nAt the close of Wednesday’s memorial, Daniel’s father reiterated his belief the day wasn’t just about celebrating Daniel’s past, but his future. \n“As surely as Jesus lives, Daniel is with him at this time,” Mike Fitzwater said. “Well done, Daniel.” \nTwitter: @RoyLangIII 11 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/sports/college/2015/10/07/early-death-prevent-fitzwater-making-impact/73548194/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:01:29.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
