Chris Perkins Contact Reporter Sun Sentinel \nDolphins interim coach Dan Campbell, who has had his players play tug of war and watch a Michael Jordan video, continued the process of toughening up his team and emphasizing competition at Wednesday's practice. He did it in yet another seldom-seen way — he had his first-team offense practice against his first-team defense. \n\"We went good-on-good today,\" Campbell said. \"We went Miami vs. Miami.\" \nYes, even in the third practice under Campbell, competition is still the name of the game as the Dolphins prepare for Sunday's game at Tennessee. \nIn Campbell's first practice last week, the Dolphins did a round of 1-on-1 battles. \nIn Campbell's second practice on Monday they did a team tug of war. They also did a drill in which they put the ball at the 5-yard line and had the offense go against the defense. The defense won and the offense had to carry their pads off the field. \nList of every Miami Dolphins head coach in team history. \nCampbell also showed his team a Michael Jordan video Monday, and basically told his players he doesn't expect them to be as good as Jordan, but he wants them to compete like Jordan. \nPlayers say the tactics are helping. \n\"It definitely helps,\" middle linebacker Kelvin Sheppard said, \"because I think guys are changing their mindsets without even realizing it.\" \nThe Dolphins didn't go starters vs. starters the entire practice Wednesday. \n\"You need a couple of periods of that,\" Campbell said. \"You get two or three plays on each other, good-on-good, where now they're coming off at each other and you set a tempo and you make it competitive where, hey, there is a winner and a loser. You understand that. To me that helps. Did Ndamukong Suh wear sneakers to practice as a protest? \"People can't handle the truth.\" \nNdamukong Suh's post-practice interview covered his reaction to the coaching change, and rumors about footwear. \nNdamukong Suh's post-practice interview covered his reaction to the coaching change, and rumors about footwear. \n\"It helps your sense of urgency and urgency is going to help you obviously when you walk out there for play one versus Tennessee on Sunday.\" \nStarters vs. starters during the regular season isn't common in NFL circles. \nUsually the first-team offense and first-team defense only face each other in training camp. During the season, the first-team offense faces a scout team that simulates the defense of that week's opponent, and the first-team defense faces a scout team that simulates the offense of that week's opponent. \nHowever, some teams do allow their starters go at it during the season. \nTennessee coach Ken Whisenhunt said when he was an assistant coach in Pittsburgh under Bill Cowher they'd occasionally have the starters face off during the regular season, and ex-NFL coach Tony Dungy said Seattle's Pete Carroll does the same thing. \n\"I covered the Seahawks leading up to the Super Bowl [last year], and that's Pete Carroll's whole thing,\" Dungy said. \"They did a lot of things like that — compete, compete, compete. \n\"They did drills with the first-team offense against the first-team defense, which you never see during the season. But his whole thing was that if we compete every single day we're going to be better. \n\"They'll pick up on Dan's vibe, no doubt about it. But a lot of it has to fall on the players. Everyone looks at the coach first, but the players have to respond.\" \nDefensive tackle Ndamukong Suh agrees with what Campbell is doing, and likes the aggressive edge he's bringing. Suh thinks it could benefit the defense. \n\"I love Dan's opinion,\" Suh said. \"I love his motto of toeing the line and just being a physical and downhill team, setting the tempo and setting the tone of the game. I think that's what we need to do on the defensive side of the ball. \n\"If we want to be successful, we've got to go out there and set the tone.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:46:23.953+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
