The Cansayapi team – which recently went 4-0 on the way to winning a tournament held in Burns, Ore. – and the Sioux Falls Sparks will both be part of a new youth lacrosse league in 2016 that will feature teams from Southern Minnesota, Iowa and North and South Dakota. “We’re excited about the formation of this new league,” Franky Jackson said. “We’ve worked hard at positioning our club to be contenders.” The Dakota Premier Lacrosse League – which hopes to begin play in mid-April of 2016 – will be hosting boys divisions at U9, U11, U13, U15 and High School. Girls divisions have not been clearly established as of yet and will feature exhibition match-ups until programs are up and running. Along with the league schedule, additional player developmental opportunities will be made available that will offer kids a chance to play on “All-Star” teams and compete in local and regional tournaments with the goal of making it to a national tournament. Saturday the high school age kids from Sioux Falls and the Cansayapi teams will compete at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. It’s free to the public and a great opportunity to get out and support the kids of the Cansayapi Lacrosse team while getting a look at a sport that continues to grow nationwide.
