In classic Payton fashion, he gave no detail of the extent of the injury or any possible time table for his return. All we know is a player some were already worried about now has an injury thrown in the mix to question his longevity. \n“Is this the beginning of the end for Jahri Evans,” would be the easy analysis for this injury. The other layer is, will Senio Kelemete be enough to protect Drew Brees in Evans’ absence? Neither question breeds much optimism. \nInjuries pestered the Saints all offseason and into the beginning of the regular season. The last place they could afford a hit to, depth wise, is on either side of the line. \nEvans might not be the man he used to be, but the Saints at least hope he can return at some point and contribute in some form or fashion for a unit that is mightily struggling to open holes for the run and protect Brees. He could come back solid, but at his size and age, Adrian Peterson-like expectations for his return would be ill-advised.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:17:18.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
