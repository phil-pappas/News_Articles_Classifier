Two of those losses came at home, in games the Chiefs seemed to have in hand. Offensive mistakes and poor defense fueled the defeats. \nBut, as bad as that is, it could lead to bigger problems.\n\"The concern for Andy is that the guys stop buying in,\" he told KCTV5. \"If they stop listening to coaches, or start pointing fingers at each other, this could really get ugly.\"\nThe long-time exec has always been a big fan of Chiefs Coach Andy Reid, and he said Reid is in a dangerous situation.\n\"I think the players respect Andy,\" he said, \"But if the owner undermines him in any way, that could change. It could really implode.\"\nChiefs Chairman Clark Hunt personally selected his head coach, and general manager, so it would appear highly-unlikely that he would do or say anything to put the leaders of his franchise in a bad light. Even when faced with firing former GMs Carl Peterson and Scott Pioli, Hunt did nothing in advance to put his GMs in a bad position.\nThe NFL executive told KCTV5 that he is also worried about the Chiefs quarterback.\n\"Alex Smith has been left 'naked,'\" he said, \"First, he had no offensive line and now he loses the main component of his running game. Good luck with that.\"\nHe said the loss of Jamaal Charles will make Reid's game-planning and play calling job a lot harder, and that an already weak Chiefs offense will have an even harder time moving forward.\nHe also said the problems extend to the defense.\n\"I think (Chiefs defensive coordinator) Bob Sutton's in trouble.\" he said. \"I really like Bob, but that defense should be better.\"\nThe veteran exec has faced these kinds of issues himself, and he says he \"feels for those guys.\" \"I hope they get it fixed,\" he said.\nSo do the millions of Chiefs fans world-wide.\nKC will play at Minnesota this Sunday. A game you can see right here on KCTV5. Kick off's at Noon.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
