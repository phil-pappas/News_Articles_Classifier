The crowd kept loud noises to a minimum, rousing themselves mainly when a video clip featuring Giants players as characters in “Full House,” was shown on a tribute night devoted to the late ’80s sitcom about a family of, like, 10, living in a three-bedroom house in San Francisco, presumably because that’s all they could afford.\nIt’s difficult to replicate the intensity – the “sense of urgency,” to use the phrase Tuesday’s hero, Clayton Kershaw, used to challenge his teammates a month ago – of a divisional showdown with the less-tangible motivation of home-field advantage.\nNot surprisingly then, the Dodgers went meekly against Giants right-hander Mike Leake on Wednesday, managing just two hits and losing, 5-0.\n“Yeah, we’re full of alcohol and champagne and stuff like that,” Dodgers outfielder Carl Crawford acknowledged with a chuckle. “In the back of your mind, you’re playing for home-field advantage. But you know we’re still in the playoffs.\n“We partied all night in the clubhouse last night. Today was one of those days you just try to make it through.”\nThe loss left the Dodgers still one game behind the New York Mets for home-field advantage in their best-of-5 NL Division Series matchup. With four games to play, the Dodgers need to make up two games – the Mets (who also lost Wednesday) hold the tiebreaker edge.\n“I think human nature-wise it’s a little bit of a day that’s kind of flat,” Dodgers manager Don Mattingly acknowledged. “You kind of hope your starter will go out and give you four or five innings, keep you in the game and guys can get into the flow of the game. But I think human nature-wise, there’s a few of them where it’s hard to get going that next day.”\nWednesday was not a good day for the Dodgers to rely on their starting pitcher to carry them for awhile. Mike Bolsinger gave up a two-run home run to Matt Duffy in the first inning and was pulled in the fourth.\nBy the time Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie Tanner to “Full House”-ophiles) led the crowd in “Take Me Out to the Ballgame” during the seventh-inning stretch, the Giants had the game firmly in hand.\nAfter serving as duct tape for the back of the rotation early in the season, Bolsinger (6-6) has come unraveled in September. Over five starts this month, he allowed 20 runs (seven home runs) in 201/3 innings and made it through five innings just once.\n“Ending the season like this is disappointing,” Bolsinger said. “But cut off this month and it was a really good year, a lot better than last year. I really felt like I belonged.\n“It’s tough. I wish this had happened at a different time because I want to finish strong.”\nBefore the game, Mattingly promised that he would continue to send out his front-line players as long as home-field advantage is still at stake – “We’ll keep playing,” he said. But Adrian Gonzalez (back), Howie Kendrick (hamstring) and Justin Turner (knee) were given the night off to protect their nagging injuries.\nEven with that, the Dodgers’ day-after lineup probably had more name recognition than Sweetin. But Kimmy Gibbler might have been able to handle that listless lineup.\nLeake (11-10) retired nine of the first 10 Dodgers, a walk producing the Dodgers’ only baserunner in the first three innings – and a double play quickly erasing him. Jimmy Rollins ended the parade with a one-out single in the fourth inning. Rollins made it to third base on a balk and a ground out before stalling.\nAustin Barnes drew a walk in the fifth inning and was also stranded at third as a procession of 11 consecutive Dodgers were retired by Leake before Crawford beat out an infield single to start the ninth.\nLeake got 18 ground-ball outs with only four balls leaving the infield over the final five innings. The Dodgers got back to their hotel rooms quickly, forcing Leake to throw fewer than 12 pitches in five innings, including a four-pitch sixth.\n“We went up there hacking,” Crawford said. “He was throwing strikes. He had his cutter working.\n“He did what he needed to do.”\nContact the writer: bplunkett@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:20:56.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
