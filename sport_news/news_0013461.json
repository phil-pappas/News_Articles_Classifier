The accident left George paralyzed from the neck down. Now his days are spent in intensive rehabilitation at Goldwater Hospital on Roosevelt Island.\nEven in the face of overwhelming adversity, George remains positive about his future, saying, \"I'm doing great. It's my goal to walk again someday and go to college.\"\nWith no insurance, the 20-year-old George and his mother, Laverne, are facing daunting medical bills, which are expected to run into the hundreds of thousands.\nIn an effort to help Alanzo's cause, the Diane Brennan Scholarship Fund will forego its usual practice of offering a pair of $5,000 scholarships to local high school student-athletes this year and donate the entire $10,000 toward Alanzo's ongoing recovery.\nThe Diane Brennan Scholarship Fund was established in memory of the late Daily News High School Sports Editor, who died of cancer in 1995.\n\"This is a very special kid,\" said Rock Eisenberg, George's basketball coach at Tilden. \"One in a million. If anyone deserves help, this is the kid.\"\nEisenberg, along with Ed Rose, the head of investment banking firm the Maxim Group, have formed The Alanzo George Road to Recovery Trust, which already has raised more than $60,000 to help offset George's mounting medical bills.\nRose also made it possible for Alanzo to attend his graduation at Tilden last month when he hired an ambulance to transport him to Brooklyn for the ceremonies, the first time Alanzo had been out of the hospital since his accident.The highlight of Alanzo's day was when his 6-year-old brother, Lorenzo, walked up onto the stage to receive his Tilden diploma.\n\"It was one of the best days I've had this year,\" Alanzo said. \"Just to meet my friends, teachers and classmates again. It was great.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:35:40.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
