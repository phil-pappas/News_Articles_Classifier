'Oh my, don't open your doors, don't let them reach us. They should stay with you,'\" Erdogan added in Strasbourg, according to Hurriyet newspaper.\nThe typically bullish speeches will concern European Union officials who are hoping to convince Erdogan to shelter more Syrian refugees in return for aid.\nErdogan's trip, officially a state visit to Belgium, has been repeatedly postponed amid tensions over Turkey's stalled bid to join the EU.\nThe bloc, long critical of what it sees as Erdogan's growing authoritarianism, is now looking to Turkey's most popular politician to help solve its worst migration crisis since the break-up of former Yugoslavia.\nDiplomats say the focus is how to better manage the flows of migrants fleeing fighting and the brutality of Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq, which will be at the centre of a major meeting in Luxembourg on Thursday of EU, Western Balkan and East Mediterranean countries.\nThe EU, which pledged at least 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) for Syrian refugees in Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and other countries last month, says it wants to help Turkey absorb and integrate more migrants on its own soil and cooperate closely with Greece in preventing mass migrant flows.\nA German newspaper on Sunday said that the European Commission, the EU executive, had already agreed a plan with Ankara to stem the flow of refugees to Europe by patrolling Turkey's frontier with Greece and setting up new camps.\nBut a senior EU official involved in negotiations with Turkey said the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung report, which detailed six new refugee camps for two million people, was \"not in line with what we have been discussing\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:33:00.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
