Michigan State put 10 men on the line of scrimmage and rushed them all. \nBy now, you know what happened next. \nAsked about the punt alignment Monday evening after his radio show, Harbaugh admitted that in hindsight, he'd like a chance to approach that play differently. \n\"It's been my experience, you would've done it a different way,\" he told a small group of reporters after the show. \"You'd certainly like an attempt to try it a different way.\" \n\"The strength of the pocket was to catch it, take a step to the right and punt the ball. That's where the protection (was supposed to be).\" \nObviously the Wolverines never got to that point, as O'Neill mishandled Scott Sypniewski's snap and opted to pick up the ball and attempt another kick rather than just falling on it. The ball popped into the air and landed right into the arms of MSU's Jalen Watts-Jackson, who ran 38 yards for the game-winning touchdown as time expired. \nAsked if the gunners were lined up where they were supposed to be on the play, Harbaugh said they were. Asked if he felt the snapper was ran into too fast at the line of scrimmage, Harbaugh said he didn't have anything to add on that. \n\"You look at (everything),\" Harbaugh added. \"The things we're doing to put ourselves in position to win the football game and then all the other things that put us in position where we didn't win. \n\"And where we can improve and find ways to get better from. I feel like that's our football team, we've been improving every week and we'll continue along that track.\" \nIn terms of O'Neill and how he's handled the entire situation, Harbaugh says he's been extremely proud of his punter's ability to push through adversity and get himself back in a strong mental state. \nHe spoke with O'Neill after the game and has remained in contact with him since, and says he believes the graduate transfer from Australia will handle himself as well as anyone who has ever been in an adverse athletic situation has. \n\"I talked to him (after the game), and I've been talking to him,\" Harbaugh said. \"What's confirmed is that he's a strong individual. A strong individual of character and I believe he's going to handle it. \n\"I think he's going to handle it as well or better than anybody we've seen in this position. This is, as I said, it's never one play in a football game that determines (the outcome) of a football game. I've never seen it. It didn't happen in this game. I don't think I ever will see it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:37:37.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
