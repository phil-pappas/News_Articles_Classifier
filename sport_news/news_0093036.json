Fedora said he will reinstate starting sophomore cornerback M.J. Stewart on Sunday. \nBoth players were indefinitely suspended last week from team-related activities for a violation of team rules, sidelining them from last weekend's win against Wake Forest. Stewart will end up missing two games during the suspension. \n\"Based on everything that I know at this time, it's the appropriate action,\" Fedora said, though he wouldn't elaborate further. \nThe altercation took place early Oct. 4 — less than a day after UNC had won at Georgia Tech in Atlanta for the first time since 1997 — at the address of a fraternity house, according to a police incident report. That report listed two victims who resided there, though arrest warrants filed last week for each player listed only one victim. \nHughes was charged with assault inflicting serious injury for punching the victim and breaking his nose, knocking him unconscious and causing a concussion as well as lingering health issues, according to an arrest warrant. \nStewart was charged with assault and battery for punching the victim \"several times in the face,\" according to an arrest warrant. \nBoth players still face court hearings. Stewart is scheduled to appear in court Thursday, while Hughes' court date was continued until Nov. 19. Fedora said the resolutions of those court cases could \"possibly\" affect the status of both players in the future. \nThe Tar Heels (5-1) host the Cavaliers with a chance to earn their first 3-0 start in Atlantic Coast Conference play since 1997, which was Mack Brown's final season before leaving to coach at Texas. \nFollow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap and the AP's college football site at http://collegefootball.ap.org \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:49:52.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
