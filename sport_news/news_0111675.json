If Brees doesn't play, the Saints still have the home field and, at 0-3, a greater sense of desperation than the Cowboys.\nEither way, a Dallas victory would constitute an upset.\nAnd that's OK. When these two teams play in New Orleans, the underdog garb is the preferred attire. The better team usually doesn't win this game.\nLet's throw out that 49-17 debacle in 2013. Brees played that game and the Cowboys didn't. He passed for 392 yards and four touchdowns that Sunday night. The 6-2 Saints were on their way to an NFC wild card that season and the 5-4 Cowboys were spinning their wheels on the way to a third consecutive 8-8 season.\nBut in each of the four previous games in New Orleans between these two teams, the underdog prevailed.\nIn 1998 the Cowboys were still motoring along on the fumes of a dynasty. They went into New Orleans with an 8-4 record on the way to another NFC East title. The Saints were 5-7 and riding a two-game losing streak. But the Saints held Emmitt Smith to 6 yards on 15 carries and Troy Aikman failed to throw for 200 yards in a 22-3 New Orleans victory over the Cowboys.\nIn 1999 it was an even worse mismatch on paper. The Cowboys brought Troy, Emmitt and a 7-7 record to the Superdome on the way to an NFC wild card that season. The Saints were 2-12 and giving World League alum Jake Delhomme his first NFL start at quarterback. Delhomme shredded the Cowboys for 278 yards and two touchdowns and ran for another score in a 31-24 New Orleans victory.\nIn 2003 it was more of the same, again the Cowboys' game to lose. And they lost it. The Cowboys were 10-5 and on the way to the playoffs as a wild card. The Saints were 7-8 and on the way home. But Aaron Brooks threw for 243 yards and a touchdown for the Saints and Quincy Carter threw three interceptions for the Cowboys as New Orleans prevailed, 13-7.\nIn 2009 the Saints were the team to beat. They entered the game as the last of the NFL unbeatens at 13-0. The Cowboys arrived at 8-5 with a two-game losing streak. But Tony Romo won a nationally-televised shootout with Brees that Saturday night, passing for 312 yards and a touchdown in a 24-17 victory.\nRomo won't be around for this one. He was placed on the eight-week injured reserve list with a broken clavicle suffered in the second game against Philadelphia. That makes the Cowboys an automatic underdog.\nHere are the simple mathematics: the Cowboys need to win three of the seven games Romo will miss to give their quarterback a shot at stealing the NFC East in December.\nLooking at the first six games Romo would miss, I figured the best chance for a victory was the Atlanta game. But the Cowboys gave that one away last week, blowing a 28-17 halftime lead on the way to a 39-28 loss. That serves New Orleans up as a must-win assignment for the Cowboys.\nThe Romo-less Cowboys figure to be underdogs the next four Sundays -- home games against the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, the defending NFC champion Seattle Seahawks and the Philadelphia Eagles plus a road game at the New York Giants.\nSo the Saints now need to pencil in as one of those three victories. So would the Buccaneers in Tampa on Nov. 15, the final game Romo figures to sit.\nBut where is the other victory going to come from? The Giants with Victor Cruz back? He missed the season-opening loss to the Cowboys. The Cowboys couldn't cover one Julio Jones last week. How are they going to cover Cruz, Odell Beckham Jr. and Rueben Randle?\nCan the Cowboys beat the Eagles? You can bet Chip Kelly is anxious for a rematch, especially with Romo watching instead of playing. Kelly should have his offense figured out by November.\nIf the Cowboys lose to the Saints, they likely would need to beat both the Giants and Eagles with Brandon Weeden at quarterback. That's a tall task for a quarterback with a 5-17 starting record.\nA 9-7 finish could win the NFC East. But if the Eagles and Giants can continue their upswing, it may take 10-6. If the Cowboys can win three games without Romo, he would need to engineer at least four victories in the final seven games to have a shot at the East -- and four of those games are on the road.\nEvery game the Cowboys lose without Romo dials up the pressure on him when he does return. So the Cowboys can't afford a loss in New Orleans Sunday night.\nAnd as the underdog, history says they find themselves in a position to steal this one.\nListen to Rick Gosselin at 10:50 a.m. Tuesdays on Sportsradio 1310 AM/96.7 FM The Ticket with Norm Hitzges, and follow @RickGosselinDMN on Twitter\nMore Cowboys coverage Ã‚ Latest news, opinion, analysis\nGeorge: Lance Dunbar, Cowboys' Darren Sproles starter kit, will return to play in hometown New Orleans\nCowboys' Jeremy Mincey regrets playing with concussion: Family is 'team' I should play for\nBob Sturm: On the offensive line's struggles; on Brandon Weeden's short throws\nQB Tony Romo does light cardio work\nBob Sturm: What kind of impact Greg Hardy will have when he returns; is Terrance Williams a No. 2 WR?\nRB Lance Dunbar: Sitting back and watching for a couple years made me a better person\nCowboys Q&A: Tyler Clutts explains rookie songs, being in chess club, the weird things his son eats and more\nChristine Michael in the mix to be on Cowboys' active roster\nSportsDay experts, more give their Week 4 NFL picks\nDo the Dallas Cowboys have a quarterback controversy?\nTerrell Owens is still waiting for Jerry Jones to call about that Cowboys comeback\nSturm's Xs and Os: How Cowboys made Julio Jones' 45-yard TD easier and more\n10 things you might not know about Lance Dunbar, including how he ended up at North Texas\nCowboys send RB Joseph Randle message after his career day\nWashington basketball star still has soft spot for Cowboys\nWhat players, coaches, execs, opponents say Travis Frederick: Doesn't matter if QB is back there making a sandwich, we have to hold our blocks\nCowboys WR Terrance Williams takes responsibility for disappearing act, says 'there are no excuses'\nCowboys' Brandon Weeden never thought he'd ever be asked if he checks down too much\nSaints coach Sean Payton: Cowboys might be lacking 'spaghetti sauce' element without Tony Romo\nStephen Jones: We're not trying to hold on, we're trying to win games\nSaints RB Mark Ingram: 'Anytime you get a chance to play the Cowboys it's always a big deal'\nFun stuff\nFantasy football: Time to grab Cowboys' Lance Dunbar\nCowboys fans tear into Brandon Weeden in Top 25 fan-made memes\nNeed a laugh after the game?
