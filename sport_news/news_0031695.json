The two teams split the first two games of the series in Busch Stadium. First pitch is scheduled for 6pm ET and you can watch on TBS.\nBoth the Cubs and Cardinals announced their starting lineups for Game 3 early on Monday. Let's start with the visiting Redbirds:\n3B Matt Carpenter 1B Stephen Piscotty LF Matt Holliday RF Jason Heyward SS Jhonny Peralta CF Tommy Pham C Yadier Molina 2B Kolten Wong RHP Michael Wacha Slight change for the Cardinals, who have Pham in the starting lineup instead of someone like Randal Grichuk or Brandon Moss . Grichuk started Game 1 in right (Heyward in center and Piscotty at fist) and Moss started Game 2 at first (Heyward in center and Piscotty in right).\nNow here is the lineup for the home Cubbies:\nCF Dexter Fowler RF Jorge Soler 3B Kris Bryant 1B Anthony Rizzo 2B Starlin Castro LF Kyle Schwarber SS Addison Russell C Miguel Montero RHP Jake Arrieta Soler did not start either the Wild Card game or Game 1 of the NLDS, but he is back in the starting lineup for the second straight game. He has not yet made an out this postseason -- Soler has a double, a home run and three walks in five plate appearances.\nAlso, that Arrieta guy is on the mound for the Cubs. He's rather good. Jorge Soler remains in the lineup for Game 3.
