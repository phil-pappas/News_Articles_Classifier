He'll return to Pennsylvania on Saturday, when the Black Knights visit Penn State for the first time since 1979. \nDavidson, an all-state linebacker for the Green Hornets last year, is among 18 freshmen who have played for Army West Point this season. Davidson, listed as a second-team outside linebacker, has played in all four games for the Black Knights, making two tackles. \n\"I think he is a heck of a player,\" Army West Point coach Jeff Monken said. \"He has played on every special teams for us and is making an impact on those teams as a true freshman.\" \nFollowing Army West Point's season-opening game against Fordham, Davidson was one of four players awarded a Ranger jersey for showing \"extraordinary effort.\" Those players wore the special jersey, which features a U.S. Army Ranger patch, during practice. \n\"I know a lot of our guys on the team have been to Penn State games as young kids, as fans, and Andy is one of those guys,\" Monken said. \"He's just a terrific young football player. We're really excited and we were thrilled when he decided that he was going to join us here at West Point.\" \nKEYS TO VICTORY \nPENN STATE NITTANY LIONS \n1. Run the ball, finish drives. Even without its top two backs, Penn State's offense should be successful moving the ball on the ground. Capping drives with TDs will make a difference. \n2. Maintain defensive responsibilities. The defense's back seven (notably the linebackers) will be tested by the triple option. They need to fill lanes and hold edges. \n3. No more injuries. With the non-conference schedule ending, the Lions can't afford many more injuries entering Big Ten play. Indiana, next week's opponent, is 4-0 heading to Saturday's game against Ohio State. \nARMY WEST POINT BLACK KNIGHTS \n1. A healthy Ahmad Bradshaw. The quarterback, who sustained an ankle injury last week, is Army's leading rusher, averaging 85 yards per game. Army coach Jeff Monken was hopeful Bradshaw would return. \n2. Keep it close through 3 quarters. The dogged Black Knights have lost three games by a combined total of 10 points. They don't wither. \n3. Win the dueling run game. Army runs a lot of clock (31:25 per game) and gets a bunch of rushing first downs. Long series that tire Penn State's defense might give Army a chance. \nFIVE THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW \n1. Penn State seeks its second four-game win streak under James Franklin. The Lions began last season 4-0. \n2. Penn State is 35-27-4 all-time against teams from the service academies. The Lions, who first played Navy in 1894, have won 18 of their last 19 games against the service academies. \n3. Army hasn't won back-to-back, regular-season road games since 2003. Last week's win at Eastern Michigan was Army's first regular-season road win since 2010. \n4. Quarterback Christian Hackenberg ranks second in Penn State history with 6,600 career yards passing. He needs 613 to pass Zack Mills' school record of 7,212 \n5. The Nittany Lions haven't won their first four home games in a season since 2008. Penn State went 7-0 at home that season. \nPREDICTION \nSloppy, and maybe sluggish, but another grinded-through win for the Lions. \nPENN STATE 21-7", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:31:57.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
