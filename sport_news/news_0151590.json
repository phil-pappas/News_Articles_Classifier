Staff photo by Kathryn Ingall slideshow As Woodstock and Cherokee meet tonight at the Wolverine Den, the Wolverines need to win to get back into playoff contention, while the Warriors need a win to keep pace with the top teams in Region 5 .After a late loss to Lassiter last week, Woodstock (3-3, 1-3) has fallen two games in the loss column behind the final playoff spot, but coach Brent Budde said he won’t worry about what he can’t control.“I don’t know if I would call the feeling around the team increased urgency,” he said. “We just have to take care of Woodstock and execute our game plan. We have to give great effort like our kids always give, do the little things and let the chips fall where they fall.”As one of three region teams with only one loss, Cherokee (4-1, 2-1) also needs a win with games against Walton and Roswell looming. “I told our kids last week that every game from this point forward is a playoff game for us,” Cherokee coach Josh Shaw said. “We’re trying to get to game 11 and, in order to do that, we have to win several out of the next five. We don’t have the luxury, with the loss already to Etowah, to drop another one. That’s the way we’ve approached it. We had an excellent week of practice, and hopefully it carries over to (tonight).”Cherokee will have to beat Woodstock quarterback Liam Byrne, who is starting again in the place of injured Garrett Bass. Though Byrne may be a backup in name, Shaw said he knows better than to prepare for a second-tier talent.“You definitely have to stop their passing game,” he said. “They’re throwing it between 40 and 50 times per game, so that’s obviously a major concern for us. They’re pretty skilled at the skill positions, and they have a really, really good quarterback. I know the starter got hurt, but this guy could start for the majority of the teams in our region.”Byrne validated that concern last week, throwing for 303 yards and two touchdowns in his first start. He has developed a rapport with receivers Louis Hall, Ethan Chamberlin and Jerrail McMickens, and Budde said his confidence in Byrne is even higher this week.One thing Cherokee will have going for itself is the return of injured defensive backs Christian Vines and Caleb Brown, though Shaw said he would “ease them in and see where we need them.”Offensively, the Warriors have reached a new level of confidence after quarterback Nolan Donley set career-highs in completions, attempts and yards last week, going 24-of-41 for 269 yards. Shaw said Donley’s emergence has expanded his offensive playbook and helped in the run and pass game.“We have to focus on how they line up and adjust to formations. That will dictate whether we run or pass,” Shaw said. “Nolan had a great game last week. We feel like he’s gotten better and better every week we’ve played. He’s making great decisions, and the offense has been able to expand each week.”Even with the expanded playbook, coaches know that to stop Cherokee, they first must stop Duke commitment Brittain Brown, who has rushed for a county-leading 890 yards and 12 touchdowns this season. Budde said stopping the dynamic Cherokee offense will be a task given to every player on his defense.“I think the key for our front seven will, obviously, be trying to keep Brittain Brown contained in there,” he said. “We have to definitely play below pad level and fit our gaps. If we stand up and they get us moving, it’s going to be a tough night for us. We can’t forget about the pass, though, because they can still pass it. When they pass it, we have to get pressure and cover them up in the secondary. It’s definitely going to be a team effort.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:03:07.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
