Anderson equal with Akram Shah out with injury, Rashid makes England debut By Published Tuesday, October 13, 2015 Pakistan bowler Yasir Shah celebrates after he dismissed Sri Lankan cricket captain Angelo Mathews during the first one day international (ODI) cricket match between Sri Lanka and Pakistan at The Rangiri Dambulla International Cricket stadium in Dambulla, on July 11, 2015. (AFP) \nAnderson is level with Pakistan great Wasim Akram on 414 wickets after dismissing Masood. Malik scores his first runs in Test cricket after five years by punching Anderson through point for a couple. Anderson strikes rattling Masood with a bouncer which ricochets off the helmet onto the stumps. Pak 5-1, 2.5 overs. Shan Masood b Anderson 2 (6b) Pakistan are off the mark as Hafeez gets a single off Anderson.\"It's a test of others in the side to show their character,\" says Misbah who is critical of the management, saying that the absence of another spinner from the party is \"disappointing\". Shoaib Malik will play his first Test since August 2010. Cant blame Misbah having a go at his selectors. No reserve spinner and unable to get visa in time for replacement for home Test is farcical. — mike selvey (@selvecricket) October 13, 2015 \nOf their last 15 Test series abroad England have only won the first Test once, drawn five times and lost nine. \nPakistan won the toss and will bat in Abu Dhabi.

Former England spinner Graeme Swann thinks so. Adil Rashid makes his Test debut for England. Key leg spinner Yasir Shah has been ruled out with an injury as Pakistan elect to bat first after Misbah wins the toss. \n\nWorst news ever for the England bowlers cook has lost the toss and they are in the field! #youhadonejobskipper — Graeme Swann (@Swannyg66) October 13, 2015 \nPreview Former Pakistan cricketer Azhar Mahmood has said that it will not be easy for Pakistan to play against England in their upcoming series at United Arab Emirates (UAE). Mahmood lauded the England side, saying that the team is riding high on confidence as they are playing aggressive cricket from few months, PakPassion reported. The 40-year-old added that some of the England’s players could prove to be dangerous for Pakistan, adding that it would be a hard-fought series. Mahmood, however, felt that Pakistan could have one advantage over England that is the latter’s weakness against spin, with Pakistan boasting of the spin duo of Yasir Shah and Zulfiqar Babar, who are known to be lethal on the UAE wickets. The tour to UAE will be a crucial one for England as they would want to redeem themselves after the thrashing they took last time. Pakistan will have the psychological edge going into the tour, but England too will go in with a lot of confidence after regaining the Ashes recently. With quality spinners at the disposal of both sides, it will be crucial as to how the two sides negotiate spin. Players from the subcontinent are known to play spin well. Considering that the pitches in UAE will be a spin-friendly, it certainly gives Pakistan the edge. England have Moeen Ali, Samit Patel and Adil Rashid as their spinners, but they do not have the experience of their counterparts. England lost 3-0 when they last faced Pakistan in the UAE in 2012, when their batsmen repeatedly struggled on the slow, spin-friendly pitches. Pakistan have not lost any of the seven Test series they have played in the UAE since 2010. Yorkshire leg-spinner Adil Rashid - who took 0-55 and 3-53 in the warm-up matches - will make his debut. The 27-year-old Yorkshire bowler scored 51 with the bat in the first warm-up match against Pakistan A and took 3-53 in the second. Number three batsman Ian Bell and wicketkeeper Jos Buttler look set to play in the first Test, but both are under pressure after a run of low scores. Bell, who made 19 and 53 in England's warm-up matches, has gone 17 innings without a century and is averaging just 24.29 this year. Buttler has not passed 50 in his past eight Test innings and made a total of 41 runs in three innings during the warm-up games. Although he did not make his Test debut until October 2014 at the age of 28, Yasir has enjoyed a remarkable first year at the top. He became the quickest Pakistan bowler to 50 wickets - in only nine Tests (Warne needed 14) - and his tally of 61 at an average of 24.81 has taken him to fourth in the International Cricket Council rankings. However, they have won three and drawn four of their seven Test series since relocating their home matches to the UAE, which includes a 3-0 mauling of England in 2012. Australia lost 2-0 in the UAE in October 2014, while neither South Africa nor New Zealand managed to win in Pakistan's 'home' conditions in the past two years. Ben Stokes believes beating Pakistan in the UAE, where they were drubbed 3-0 in the Test series in 2012, would be as big an achievement as regaining the Ashes in England.
