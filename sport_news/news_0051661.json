None of the Wild's goals came off deflections or strange bounces. They each beat Varlamov cleanly.\nOn Friday, Roy said Varlamov was not to blame.\nGet sports news and updates right in your inbox Sign up to receive news alerts and a daily roundup of all things Colorado sports delivered to your inbox.\n\"It's an opportunity for a goalie to close the door. Yes. But we need to help him,\" Roy said. \"We didn't help him in that third period. If you look at the goals that they scored, they were not easy saves. We need to be better, limit the turnovers in the neutral zone and not allow them to get in the slot area. If they score from the outside, it would be different.\"\nThe Avalanche practiced Friday at the Pepsi Center, in front of season-ticket holders who got the first public glimpse of the team's third-jersey attire — which includes navy helmets and breezers (pants).\nColorado will make its debut in the third jerseys Oct. 24. against Columbus.\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or @mikechambers\nAdvertisement", "external_links": ["http://denverpostplus.com/app/mailer-rules/www/", "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Andada|Montserrat:400,700|Open+Sans:400,800,700,400italic"], "published": "2015-10-09T09:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:48:38.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
