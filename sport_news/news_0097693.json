Although Le Coq managed to maintain his overall lead with a couple of wins on Tuesday to add to his already impressive scoreline, he didn’t have it all his own way in the 82-strong fleet. \nIn the day's second race - the yellow fleet - Spain's Ivan Pastor edged Le Coq in the closing stages and notched up his first win of the week, while China's Zhichao Zhi, sailing in his first ever world championship, won in the blue fleet. \nAt the end of the day's racing, Zhi had a scoreline of four, one, two to move up the rankings to second overall with a nett score of 12. Le Coq has a nett score of six to remain on top, while Pastor was third with a nett score of 13. \nZhi said, “This is the first time I have sailed abroad and it's my debut in a world championship. I am delighted to be here and I am really happy to be doing so well. I think the reason I am fast in these conditions is because I am light. The aim now is to continue to do well by sailing normally without taking too much pressure. I am really keen to learn from the other guys and to keep improving.” \nZhichao Zhi of China competes in the blue fleet on Tuesday \nOverall leader Le Coq said, “Having three races in these conditions is very hard for us. It's very challenging to be in front and to be consistent, so I am really happy.” \nIn the women’s fleet, 26 year old Peina retained her overall lead, but said she found it extremely tough on Tuesday. \nA penalty turn in the first race of the day was not the best start, but Peina managed a runner-up and a third-place finish in the next two races to total a nett of eight and stay ahead of the rest. \nCharline impresses \nOne of the most notable performances came from French girl Charline Picon. A winner at the ISAF Sailing World Championships in Santander, Spain last year, she came up with a stunning performance. \nIn the closing stages of the first race, she outplayed leader Zofia Noceti-Klepacka of Poland in the final stretch to snatch a win. She then went on to score another first place and a second, climbing to overall second with a nett score of ten. \nA delighted Charline said, “I had a very good day, but it is tough here. The light winds are physically demanding. As it is an Olympic qualifier, it is extremely competitive. Peina is in very good shape. From here on, it will be in more tough because I will be racing against only the best girls in the gold fleet and every point will be important.” \nPoland's Malgorzata Bialecka, who won the concluding blue fleet race of the day, retained her third place overall with a nett of 11. \nThe windsurfers will take a break from action on Wednesday before returning to the waters on Thursday. \nThe men and women’s fleets will be split into gold and silver fleets, according to overall rankings from the first two days (six races). The final round of races and the medal races will take place on Saturday.
