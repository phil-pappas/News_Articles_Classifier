A 3rd-and-long run right up the gut brought back memories of former offensive coordinator Jimmy Raye. \nOne would have expected San Francisco to establish its ground game. But the Packers defense ensured this wouldn't happen by stuffing the box, which forced quarterback Colin Kaepernick into passing situations. \nAnd Kaepernick did not equal the challenge. \nPart of the problems were up front on the offensive line. The right side continues to be problematic, and right tackle Erik Pears and right guard Jordan Devey continued to give up pressure en route to a six-sack effort from the Packers defense. \nThe O-line's issues could be upsetting head coach Jim Tomsula, who declined to comment about this unit's issues to the media per Kevin Lynch of SFGate.com . \nBut the focus of the offensive ineptitude continues to fall upon Kaepernick. \nCam Inman of the San Jose Mercury News described how Packers linebacker Clay Matthews and the defense reacted to all the 49ers could not do: \nPerhaps symbolizing the 49ers’ offensive ineptitude, Clay Matthews produced a third-down sack of Kaepernick in the third quarter and celebrated by “Kaepernicking,” with Matthews kissing his own right biceps. Bradley Pinion followed with a 30-yard punt, barely better than a 21-yard shank earlier in the game. \nWith three minutes remaining, a “Go Pack Go!” chant rang out among the strong contingent of Packers fans at Levi’s Stadium. \nIf there is any positive emanating from San Francisco's offense, perhaps it's the knowledge that the only direction from here is upward.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:09:37.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
