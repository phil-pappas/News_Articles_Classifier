Virtually everybody expected plenty of offensive fireworks in a wild, high-scoring shootout.\nTurns out virtually everybody was wrong.\nThe Bobcats, displaying their finest defensive performance this year, came away with a gritty 5-0 victory over the Mustangs in front of a standing-room-only, way-past-capacity crowd to claim the league crown.\nSky View (6-0 Region 1, 10-0 overall) scored a first-quarter safety when Mountain Crest was called for offensive holding in the end zone. The Bobcats added a 29-yard field goal by Kyler Erickson in the fourth quarter and, unbelievably, that accounted for all of the game's scoring.\n\"What a game,\" said Sky View coach Craig Anhder , whose team had been averaging a whopping 43 points per game in league play. \"It's not what we expected. I told these kids a year ago, we're coming home from the Timpview game (a playoff loss), and we said you know what, to win a championship, we need the defense to do it.\n\"And credit goes to Coach Johnson and the whole defensive staff and then all those players. I mean, defense was just amazing tonight. That was one of the best defensive performances I've ever seen, I think, and by both teams. Credit to them. Their defense was amazing, too. It was just a battle out there, and I just believe our kids had the will to finish it.\n\"We finished second in the region two years in a row, so it's been on these kids' minds and they've wanted to not be second again,\" he said. \"And I just think it was grit tonight. It wasn't pretty, and defense doesn't have to be pretty. It was just grit, and it was just awesome.\"\nIndeed, the ’Cats continually came up with huge plays on defense as Colton Durrant blocked a Mountain Crest punt near midfield early in the final period to help set up Erickson's field goal.\n\"I was gonna come out, and they said stay on defense, so I'm like, 'All right, what should I do?' And I kinda thought, 'Why not go for the block?’” Durrant said. \"So I went for it and broke through the second line and it hit my hand, and I couldn't believe it.\"\n\"Oh, man, coming out on defense on that fourth down, we thought it was four-down territory for them, so we just kept our defense out,\" Sky View defensive lineman Max Christensen said. \"We had Jake Pitcher , Colton and Mason (Tye) all going up the middle, and Colton Durrant running full speed at 280 pounds, he's gonna hit somebody. He jumps up and gets that block — it was a huge momentum shift for us.\"\nRiley Haderlie , JR Martindale , Alex McRae , Breygan Holbrook , Stockton Boman and Pitcher each took turns coming up with big stops of their own, and Christensen sealed the deal when he recovered an M.C. fumble near midfield on the Mustangs' final possession with less than a minute remaining.\n\"Oh, man, what a way to play a game, I mean, defensive game all the way,\" Christensen said. \"They have a great defense, we proved we have a great defense as well, and it came down to one play.\n\"Jake Pitcher came up with a huge sack the play before, and they used their last timeout. And then I'm lucky enough to get in there and get that fumble. All the credit goes to my teammates for putting me in that position. I don't think I played that great all night, and then I was able to make that last play, so I'm happy with it.\"\nMountain Crest got solid rushing performances by Levani Damuni and Kort Fuller , and strong defense by Sirrell Hall , Payton Thomas and Taylor Demler , among others. But it wasn't quite enough to keep the Mustangs' record from falling to 5-1 in Region 1 and 8-1 overall with their first defeat. They'll still get the region's No. 2 postseason seed.\nSky View, meanwhile, takes the league's No. 1 seed into next week's opening round of the 5A playoffs.\n\"I couldn't ask for anything better of my teammates,\" added Durrant. \"They did awesome; they played for each other throughout the whole game, hard-fought game, low scoring, the most defensive game I've ever played in.\"\n\"We've been working three years for this,\" said Christensen. \"I've been starting varsity since I was a sophomore, and 18 of our guys are seniors. We're just trying to lead, trying to set a tradition here before we take off.\"\nEMAIL: rhollis@desnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:09:07.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
