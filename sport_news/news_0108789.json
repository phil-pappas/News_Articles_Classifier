It was just after half time and on a big whiteboard sitting on the bucket they had analysed the Hawthorn game style. \n“They identified five aspects where we could improve and that blew me away. \nLyon said it was inspirational to see the playing group wasn’t wallowing or giving up. \n“It tells me they are prepared to do the work and to take the emotional risk. I admire them for that.” \nPavlich remains no clearer on whether he will extend his career beyond the club record 335 games he’s currently played. \n“I’m still unsure. It’s been a whirlwind couple of weeks and I haven’t had time to understand what’s best for the football club, and for myself and my family,” Pavlich said. \n“I just want to thank the club for affording me the time to think through this thoroughly and it hasn’t been a decision that will be made lightly.” \nMeanwhile, Sandilands was humbled to claim the Doig Medal ahead of Fyfe, David Mundy and Stephen Hill. \n“I didn’t expect to come up at here at all, so it’s a bit of a shock,” Sandilands said. \n“I’m very fortunate that I’m part of the best midfield group in the comp.” Stay up to date with the latest sports news Follow our social accounts to get exclusive content and all the latest sporting news!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:50:06.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
