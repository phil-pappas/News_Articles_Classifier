Two super tiebreakers added up to one super heartbreaker for Ridgewood at last week’s state group tournament.\nThe Maroons led Ridge, 2-1, in their Group 4 semifinal and the final two matches went to 10-point super tiebreakers, played in lieu of third sets.\nSophomore Emma Hultqvist played valiantly but lost, 10-8, leaving it up to the junior second-doubles pair of Kelly Rekucki and Katherine Bonfiglio.\nAt that point, a question was asked if the second-singles match had ended. The Maroons’ pair overheard.\n“They’re supposed to keep us in the dark about that,” Bonfiglio said. “Obviously, it put a little more pressure on us knowing we had to win.\n“Our coach just told us to have fun and do our best. All our teammates came over to support us, which was great.”\nBonfiglio and Rekucki would lose, 10-8, and their team fell, 3-2. Ridgewood had lost each of the past two semifinals by the same 3-2 score, with one point going against them on a super tiebreaker.\n“We were hoping to win it this time, but I’m super proud of how the girls played,” Maroons coach Medha Kirtane said. “They played hard and smart – and above all, they were a sportsmanlike team.\n“I couldn’t have asked any more of them.”\nPRESSURE COOKER: Leonia sophomore Liya Davidov might not experience a more pressure-packed situation than she did in last week’s Group 1 final. The Lions had split the first four matches with Shore Regional, and the championship came down to Davidov’s second-singles match against Charlotte Roarty.\n“I tried to keep all that out of my consciousness, but I still felt a lot of pressure,” Davidov said. “Everyone was watching us, and it was really quiet. No one was clapping or cheering. It got my heart pumping a little faster.”\nThe group finals go to a third set instead of a super tiebreaker, and Davidov and Roarty went the distance in a riveting match.\nThe third set was on serve when Roarty broke Davidov to go ahead, 5-3. Then Roarty served it out, and Davidov was overcome with emotion.\n“I congratulated her a lot … she deserved it,” Davidov said. “She played a great match.\n“Then I went to hug my team. I said, ‘It’s amazing we got this far.’Ÿ”\nGOLIATH BEATS DAVID: As a reward for winning its third sectional championship in the past four years, Northern Highlands had the privilege of facing the state’s best team in last week’s Group 3 semifinals.\nMillburn, led by state singles champion Stephanie Schrage, made quick work of the locals by yielding a combined 14 games in a 5-0 win.\n“Everyone played a lot of good points, but we didn’t finish enough of them,” Northern Highlands coach Chris Broking said. “The girls tried their best and have nothing to be ashamed of. They had a great run getting here.\n“When you get to Mercer County Park, all the teams are good. We just happened to play the best of them.”\nLeading Northern Highlands to this year’s North 1, Group 3 crown were singles players Madison Hite, Charlotte Hagen and Emily Hite and the doubles pairs of Sarah Apsey and Chloe Decker and Gabi Tantillo and Anna Rimland.\nRIPPLE EFFECT:  The addition of freshman standout Ashley Hess to Holy Angels’ lineup bumped senior Adrianne Alfonso to second singles and ultimately helped the Angels win this year’s Non-Public A crown.\nIt also might have prevented Bergenfield’s Aishwarya Gandotra from winning the Bergen County tournament second-singles title, as her only loss in 17 matches this season was to Alfonso in the county finals.\nAlfonso also is from Bergenfield, and the two have been close friends since middle school.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:31:29.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
