So it went on a day when the Cardinals’ field of dreams became an outhouse. \nAs in, the hosts were outplayed, outfoxed and painfully outhit. \n“There was some contact out there,” Rams coach Jeff Fisher said. “There’s no doubt.” Cardinals fall to St. Louis Rams for 1st loss of season \nDoubters are on the way after a 24-22 loss to the Rams on Sunday, a game that dropped Arizona from the ranks of the elite and unbeaten. Their love affair with the national media ended shortly after Carson Palmer airmailed two passes late in the game, sealing the unexpected outcome. The Cardinals did everything possible to lose this game, from bad turnovers to bad quarterbacking to the bad decision to chirp after last year’s physical win in St. Louis. \nLessons learned? There’s only one: \nDon’t let it happen again. \n“Now that we’ve lost one at home, we better win some more on the road,” head coach Bruce Arians said. Boivin: Cardinals' David Johnson reflects on tough Sunday \nDon’t mistake this loss for a wakeup call or a blessing in disguise. The 2015 Cardinals have no problem with hunger, focus or maturity. With a back-loaded schedule, the team failed to post a 4-0 start that would cushion them for the rough road ahead. Best-case scenario: This was just a bad Sunday in the NFL, the kind that championship teams must avoid when playing at home. \nThe Cardinals never trailed in the first three weeks of the season. They never led on Sunday. They ended up chasing the score and a rookie running back. They were tangled up in the very kind of game they didn’t want to play. \nLarry Fitzgerald dropped a pass and fumbled the football in the same afternoon, the NFL equivalent of a blood moon sighting. Palmer was uncharacteristically inaccurate, possibly from the consistent beating he took from a steady diet of blitzing Rams. The play-calling was questionable down the stretch, and the Cardinals were outcoached by a Rams team that had scored fewer touchdowns than Fitzgerald entering the game. Cardinals XTRA app: Get the latest news, analysis, scores, more \n“We knew it was going to be this type of game,” cornerback Jerraud Powers said. “It was going to be a slugfest. You look at those guys over there, that defense seemed like they were flying around, trying to take guys out, just like we said. We matched their intensity for the most part.” \nClearly, the Rams had more edge. They maximized their opportunities, beating a Cardinals team that ran 20 more plays and posted twice the amount of first downs. They left Glendale with renewed optimism and a sense of vengeance. Worst-case scenario for Arizona: This is the kind of game and opponent that can haunt a season, especially if Todd Gurley’s coming-out party just changed the course of the NFC West. \nArians is a very good chess player. Except one time in college, he sat down to play a teammate named Tom Beasley, who purposely lined up his pieces in the wrong spots. Arians didn’t know he was being snookered, and bought the act. He lost the match and later found out he was playing the West Virginia state champion. Recap: Cardinals vs. Rams updates, analysis \nThat’s how Sunday’s game must’ve felt. He faced 3rd-and-2 four times in the second half, choosing to pass on each occasion. The plays resulted in two incompletions, a sack and a turnover. On a crucial fourth-down late in the game, Palmer overthrew rookie David Johnson, who was targeted 10 times in the game, one more than Fitzgerald. \nRule of thumb: If you must throw on future fourth-down attempts, get the ball to Fitzgerald, not a rookie. \nMaybe the outcome and the general perspective would be different if Palmer hadn’t misfired on his last two throws. Great quarterbacks separate themselves in big moments, at their best when the game is on the line. Since coming to Arizona, Palmer had been very good in the clutch, delivering big moments and excellent fourth-quarter statistics. Bickley: Cardinals and Rams ready for some foot-brawl \nBut not on Sunday, when Palmer lost for the first time since the final game of 2013. He offered no excuses, taking all of the blame. If there’s a silver lining anywhere, it’s that Palmer was still in one piece by the time he left University of Phoenix Stadium. Still, the over/under for time spent getting out of bed Monday morning will be set at roughly 25 minutes. \n“We just didn’t make enough plays,” Palmer said. “I didn’t make enough plays. We had chances. We had a chance to convert on third down and we had some plays we should have made that wound up being touchdowns. At the end of the day, like I said, I am the quarterback. I’ve got to help us make plays and I didn’t do that.” \nIt’s only one blemish. Nothing is lost but the chance to post an unbeaten season. But the Rams accomplished exactly what they wanted on Sunday, knocking the Cardinals off a pedestal and serving notice that the NFC West might be more than a two-team race, after all. As quiet fans filed out of the stadium, it was a sobering reminder that not everything goes your way in the NFL, not even on your own field of dreams. \nReach Bickley at dan.bickley@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8253.
