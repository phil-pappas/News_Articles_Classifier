Williams was penalized for the illegal punch. \nColon was then knocked down twice in the ninth round. He was disqualified after the ninth round his corner mistakenly took off his gloves, thinking it was the final round and that the fight was complete. \n(Reporting by Brendan O'Brien; Editing by Alan Crosby)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T22:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:10:44.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
