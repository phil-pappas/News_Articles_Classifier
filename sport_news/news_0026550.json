(AP) — USC athletic director Pat Haden was feeling lightheaded just before kickoff of the game against Notre Dame and was taken to the locker room. \nUSC sports information director Tim Tessalone said Haden was sitting up in the locker room and appeared to be stable. He said Haden may return to the sideline. \nHaden has been under scrutiny for his hiring of Steve Sarkisian and for allowing Sarkisian to continue to coach after slurring his words and using inappropriate language during an event in August and other struggles by the football team. Haden fired Sarkisian this week. \nHaden spent 12 years as a color analyst on Notre Dame television broadcasts.
