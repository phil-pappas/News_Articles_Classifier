Torres, in a separate statement issued by the team, accepted the decision and apologized to Silfverberg, his teammates and the Sharks organization. \n\"While we do not believe there was any malicious intent, this type of hit is unacceptable and has no place in our game,\" Wilson said in a statement released by the Sharks. \"There is a difference between playing hard and crossing the line and there is no doubt, in this instance, Raffi crossed that line. \n\"We're very thankful that Jakob was not seriously injured as a result of this play.\" \nThe team reserved comment until a decision on a possible appeal had been reached and after their season-opening game against the Los Angeles Kings. Wilson would not comment further beyond the statement, a team spokesman said. \nTorres' undisciplined history played a major role in the length of the suspension, which is the fifth of his NHL career. Torres has also been fined three times and warned twice for questionable on-ice conduct. \nBefore this week, Torres' most recent suspension came during the second round of the 2013 playoffs when he hit former Kings forward Jarret Stoll in the head in Game 1 and was banned for the remainder of that series. Advertisement \nHis most severe suspension came in the 2012 playoffs, when he was initially banned for 25 games for a hit on Marian Hossa. The suspension was later reduced to 21 games by NHL commissioner Gary Bettman. \nTorres, who turned 34 Thursday, missed all of last season as he recovered from two reconstructive knee surgeries. \nIn a statement released by the Sharks concurrently with Wilson's, Torres said: \"I worked extremely hard over the last two years ... to resume my NHL career, and this is the last thing I wanted to happen. I am disappointed I have put myself in a position to be suspended again. \n\"I sincerely apologize to Jakob for the hit that led to this suspension, and I'm extremely thankful that he wasn't seriously injured as a result of the play. I also want to apologize to my Sharks teammates and the organization.\" \nTorres will not be eligible to return to the NHL until Jan. 14, 2016, when the Sharks host the Edmonton Oilers. Torres will forfeit $440,860.29 of his salary this year. \nKings forwards Dustin Brown and Milan Lucic did not face any supplementary discipline from the NHL for their hits on Logan Couture in Wednesday's season opener. \n\"We felt there were a couple dangerous plays,\" Sharks coach Pete DeBoer said Thursday. \"They looked at them, chose not to take action on them, so we just have to move forward.\" \nCouture's nose was cut by Brown's helmet with a hard check in the neutral zone in the first period of Wednesday's game, seemingly well after Couture had released the puck. Officials told Couture no penalty was called because they did not get a good look at the play. \nLate in the third period, Couture upended Lucic with an open-ice hip check. Lucic got up and went after Couture, who was close to the Sharks' bench. Couture said after the game he was OK, but Lucic received a match penalty. \n\"I didn't cross any line,\" Lucic told the Orange County Register on Thursday. \"Believe me, if my intentions were to hurt (Couture), I would have hurt him.\" \nJoonas Donskoi's first NHL goal wasn't pretty, but DeBoer was impressed with Donskoi's willingness to go in front of the net. \nAfter trying to retrieve the puck along the wall in the Los Angeles zone in the third period, Donskoi went straight to the goal crease. Joe Pavelski then collected a loose puck near the goal after a shot by Marc-Edouard Vlasic, and his shot went off the crossbar, off Donskoi's hip and into the net for a 5-1 Sharks lead. \nDonskoi, who played in Finland for the last three seasons. also screened Kings goalie Jonathan Quick on Brent Burns' second-period goal, as he was on the ice for all three of San Jose's even-strength goals. \n\"You don't score unless you're willing to go to those dirty areas in any league,\" DeBoer said of Donskoi, who had 30 goals in the last two regular seasons in Finland. \"He did some grunt work on a couple of those goals.\" For more on the Sharks, see the Working the Corners blog at blogs.mercurynews.com/sharks .
