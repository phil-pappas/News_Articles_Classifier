(Photo: Marc Lebryk-USA TODAY Sports)\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE GLASGOW, Scotland — Five years after last competing at the world gymnastics championships, Chris Brooks is back in the U.S. lineup.\nBrooks was chosen Thursday to replace three-time U.S. champion Sam Mikulak, who was forced out of worlds earlier this month with a slight tear in his left Achilles. Brooks and fellow alternate Marvin Kimble both came to Glasgow, and U.S. officials made the decision on who would take Mikulak’s spot after watching them train.\nOlympic bronze medalist Danell Leyva; Donnell Whittenburg; Alex Naddour, Paul Ruggeri; and Brandon Wynn make up the rest of the U.S. team, which begins competition Monday. The Americans must finish in the top eight to secure a spot at next summer’s Rio Olympics.\nBeing added to the lineup caps an impressive comeback for the 28-year-old Brooks, who has been slowed by injuries since being an alternate on the 2012 Olympic team.\nBrooks' only other appearance at worlds was in 2010, when the U.S. men finished fourth. He was an alternate on the 2011 world team that won the bronze medal.\nTOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/028b69f006975bcca786cfe41667372d728371d9/c=0-18-2332-1771&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811143963095253-USP-GYMNASTICS-P-G-GYMNASTICS-CHAMPIONSHIPS-75184068.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811143963095253-USP-GYMNASTICS-P-G-GYMNASTICS-CHAMPIONSHIPS-75184068.JPG", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LOYCcf&text=Chris%20Brooks%20replacing%20injured%20U.S.%20gymnastics%20champ%20Mikulak%20on%20world%20team&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LOYCcf&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5bb52ef5217c3befa70617bbdd05a784ca3e5993/r=500x383/local/-/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811143963095253-USP-GYMNASTICS-P-G-GYMNASTICS-CHAMPIONSHIPS-75184068.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:05:21.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
