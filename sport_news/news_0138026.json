Marion Marauder was second, ahead of Sliding Home.\nThe victory was Southwind Frank's 11th in 12 outings. The son of Muscle Hill took his elimination race last Friday by five lengths in 1:55.2.\nGingras said the most difficulty he had with Southwind Frank came prior to the start of the race.\n\"Behind the gate he was maybe a bit more aggressive,\" Gingras said. \"He had been like that earlier in the year so I just wanted to get him off on the right foot.\n\"The rest of the way I was pretty confident.\"\nWoobine hosted harness racing's richest event for the first time in three years. In all, Saturday's card consisted of 12 championship races.\nGingras was scheduled to drive in nine of the 12 finals. But Gingras knew early Southwind Frank was a special horse.\n\"From the first time I sat behind him he was all business,\" Gingras said. \"Every time I've raced him he's (been) a true professional.\nGingras said following two-year-old colt trot, the third race on the card, the track was in good shape despite the rain.\n\"The track is pretty hard, the horses are getting over it really well,\" he said. \"We're not too muddy so I'm OK with that.\"\nSouthwind Frank paid $2.20, $2.10 and $2.10 while Marion Marauder returned $4.80 and $3.70.

Im So Fancy was second ahead of Speak To Me.\nCampbell earned his 47th career Breeders Crown win but said it woudn't have happened had Mission Brief not broken stride.\n\"My filly struggled a little bit in the last turn, I really had to be careful with her there and at that point I was thinking I'm just not going to get (Mission Brief),\" he said. \"If you're going to beat her you have to be right up on her back well into the stretch.\n\"When I came out of the turn and she squared up I looked and Yannick was out in the middle of the racetrack off stride. At that point I was just wondering about what was coming from behind.\"\nWild Honey paid $5.20, $2.90 and $9.40 while Im So Fancy returned $38.40 and $105.30.
