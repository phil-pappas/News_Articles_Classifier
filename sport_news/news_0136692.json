When you have LeBron James reasonably healthy, you have to be a favorite to reach The Finals.\nJames has done it in each of his last five seasons.\nWhile his critics will never admit it, David Blatt also grew as a coach in the playoffs as he transformed his injured team into a defensive force. Yes, he relied on assistant coach Tyronn Lue and James as the three of them formulated the plans and sold it to the team.\nBut rather than that being a negative, it should be viewed as a positive in the modern superstar-powered NBA.\nBlatt, Lue, the other assistant coaches and James will have to be at their leadership best early in the season because the Cavs will be without so many key players, including their projected starting backcourt.\nConsider that five of their key players all had surgeries within the last 10 months: Kevin Love, Kryie Irving, Iman Shumpert, Timofey Mozgov and Anderson Varejao. A sixth (Tristan Thompson) is not with the team due to a contract dispute.\nThat's why the Cavs probably will be very inconsistent early in the season.\nABOUT THE BACKCOURT\nShumpert emerged as a defensive specialist. James said Shumpert is destined to make an All-NBA defensive team. When healthy, he can defend both guard spots and even some small forwards.\nBut the 6-foot-5 Shumpert is out for about three months following wrist surgery. Then he'll have to play his way into shape during the middle of the season. Shumpert also has an injury history. He had knee surgery in 2012. He missed six weeks last season with a dislocated shoulder.\nCompounding this problem is Irving, who is still recovering from surgery in June to repair his fractured kneecap. He is not taking part in any serious practices and there has been no timetable made public for his return. It will be this season, but certainly not in the next few weeks.\nObviously, Irving is a huge loss. He's an All-Star coming off his best season. Like Shumpert, he will be trying to return with no training camp.\nIrving also has battled injuries in his young career. He missed only six regular season games in 2014-15 before his knee began to act up in the playoffs.\nBut in his first three pro seasons, Irving missed an average of 15 games per year with different physical problems.\nTHERE IS HELP\nDavid Griffin signed Mo Williams, the general manager correctly believing the 32-year-old Williams could still start for some NBA teams. He was a 14-point scorer last season.\nHe also brought back J.R. Smith on a very club-friendly contract. Smith did start 51 games between the Knicks and Cavs last season.\nSo Williams and Smith are experienced. Backup point guard Matthew Dellavedova had some excellent playoff games. In the end, his weaknesses were exposed when having to playing huge post-season minutes in place of the injured Irving.\nThe Cavs are not in terrible shape in the backcourt.\nThey also have 34-year-old Richard Jefferson, who can play shooting guard and back up James at small forward.\nBut the grand plan was for all these players to come off the bench. If that happens, Blatt can turn to Smith, Jefferson, Williams and Dellavedova for depth in the backcourt. Smith and Jefferson also can play some small forward.\nBut early in the season, those guys will be on the court a lot, some in the starting lineup.\nABOUT THE FRONTCOURT\nMany fans are angry about Tristan Thompson's contract dispute with the Cavs. The view is, \"Forget him.\"\nWell, they do need him. As for the contract stalemate, I have no idea when it will end.\nBut I do know with Love just now returning from shoulder surgery, it would be nice to have Thompson The Rebounding Machine as another big man.\nThe Cavs can start Timofey Mozgov at center, Love at power forward. But they also need to watch the minutes for both players.\nThe 7-foot Mozgov had what was considered minor off-season knee surgery and he has looked healthy in the preseason. Nonetheless, it's wise to keep him under 30 minutes.\nLove also should not be required to carry a heavy load early in the year. If he's ready for the opener (as it appears), that's a real bonus and a tribute to his post-season work ethic.\nAnderson Varejao can help at power forward and center. He's been an incredible surprise coming back from Achilles surgery. But the 33-year-old Varejao has a discouraging history of major injuries. I wrote about Varejao last week.\nIf he is asked to play a lot of minutes early in the season, that's just begging for another injury.\nSo the three key big men -- Love, Varejao and Mozgov -- are all coming off some type of surgery.\nSasha Kaun is a 6-foot-10 Russian signed by Griffin. He is a defensive presence, a physical center. It will take him time to adjust to the speed and athleticism of the NBA game after playing six years in Europe.\nJames Jones is 35 years old and will probably be able to wake up in the middle of the night and swish a 3-pointer from the corner at the age of 65. He is a terrific standstill shooter. He also can play some meaningful minutes at power forward.\nTHEN THERE'S JAMES\nConsider who started the opening game of the 2015 Finals for the Cavs: Irving, Shumpert, Mozgov, Thompson and James.\nOnly James and Mozgov are likely to be in the opening day lineup for this season.\nBlatt will be tempted to play James major minutes early in the season because the roster is depleted. But the lesson from last season is that less is more with James when it comes to playing in the first few months.\nHe missed two weeks early in January as he dealt with back and leg problems. The Cavs were 1-7 in those games. He may not play any more preseason games, which makes sense. He had a shot for some back pain , something that was planned.\nJefferson should supply far more help at small forward than Shawn Marion and Mike Miller did last season. Marion's season-high was 13 points, and he only had six games with at least 10. He was nailed to the bench in the playoffs.\nIn the postseason, Miller and Marion combined to play only 90 minutes. They scored 11 points on 4-of-11 shooting.\nJefferson is averaging 11.4 points in the preseason and looks far more prepared to help than Miller and Marion.\nPUTTING IT TOGETHER\nIt won't be easy for Blatt and his coaching staff to develop any real continuity.\nSignificant players will be out. Others will be limited. Blatt's coaching will once again be questioned because the team is likely to have an underwhelming first few months of the season.\nYes, the Cavs have been looking at some young guys such as Joe Harris, Jared Cunningham, Quinn Cook and Austin Daye. But none of them are ready for regular rotation duties on a playoff team.\nThe 6-foot-4 Cunningham comes the closest because of his athleticism. But the 24-year-old has been with four different teams in the last four seasons, playing in a grand total of 40 NBA regular season games. So it's hard to expect much from him.\nA strong return of Love will be a major boost, but Cavaliers fans should be warned. The first few months of this season will serve up a large dose of frustration as patience will be tested.\nTerry's Talkin' Browns Terry's Talkin' Indians", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:17:49.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
