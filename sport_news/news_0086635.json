NFL teams released their final Week 6 injury reports Friday. Several big-name players are anticipating a return to action.\nAdChoices The battered Bills will look to get some help from LeSean McCoy and Sammy Watkins, although Tyrod Taylor's status remains in question. Andrew Luck, on the other hand, is feeling more confident about his availability for this weekend.\nMORE: Best photos from Week 6 | Betting lines and picks: Sunday six-pack | Fantasy QB rankings\nHere are the five most impactful injuries heading into Week 6:\nAndrew Luck\nThe Colts quarterback was listed as a limited participant in practice this week, but he says he is \"pretty darn close\" to being ready for Sunday night's AFC showdown with the Patriots. He is officially listed as questionable.\nLuck has missed Indianapolis' past two games with an unspecified shoulder injury. Veteran backup Matt Hasselbeck has started in his place; he's 2-0 following a win against the Texans on Oct. 8. Hasselbeck will again be ready if Luck can't go.\n© Andrew Weber/USA TODAY Sports Buffalo Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor (5) is tackled by Cleveland Browns outside linebacker Paul Kruger (99) during the first quarter of a preseason game at FirstEnergy Stadium on Aug. 20, 2015 in Cleveland. Tyrod Taylor\nDespite an MCL injury, the Bills quarterback could still start Sunday when Buffalo hosts the undefeated Bengals.\nCoach Rex Ryan hinted at quarterback troubles Monday when the Bills signed backup Josh Johnson as insurance. He said Wednesday the team has \"a lot of confidence in EJ Manuel\" but \" would not rule out Taylor ,\" acknowledging his status will likely be a game-time decision after he was limited in practice this week. If the injury forces Taylor out, Manuel will get the start with Johnson behind him.\nOn the positive side, the Bills got two players back Wednesday when running back McCoy and wide receiver Watkins returned to practice. McCoy has missed the past two games with a nagging hamstring injury, while Watkins hasn't played since straining his calf against the Dolphins in Week 3.\nMORE: Watkins says Bills' offense 'making me look bad'\n© Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP Photo Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch sits on the sideline during the second half of an NFL preseason football game against the Oakland Raiders in Oakland, Calif., Thursday, Aug. 28, 2014. Marshawn Lynch\nThe Seahawks running back is still dealing with a nagging hamstring injury, but he is expected to play Sunday when the undefeated Panthers visit Seattle.\nLynch suffered the injury in the Seahawks' Week 3 rout of the Bears while making a fourth-and-1 catch at the end of the first half. His five carries for 14 yards were his fewest in any regular-season game for Seattle. Lynch was already hampered by a calf injury suffered the previous week and was a game-time decision to play against Chicago.\nIf Lynch returns, Thomas Rawls will transition to a backup role but still will be utilized after rushing for 169 yards on 23 carries in the Seahawks' loss to the Bengals last week. On the defensive side, the Seahawks hope to get back linebacker Bobby Wagner (chest) on Sunday, though his availability will likely be a game-time decision.\n© Doug Pensinger/Getty Images Wide receiver Demaryius Thomas of the Denver Broncos out sprints free safety Rashad Johnson of the Arizona Cardinals for an 86 yard touchdown in the second quarter on Oct. 5 in Denver. Demaryius Thomas\nThe Broncos' top wide receiver could be missing from the lineup for the first time since 2011 when Denver visits the Browns on Sunday. He's officially listed as questionable.\nThomas sat out practice all week with a neck injury he suffered in the Broncos' Week 4 win over the Vikings. He didn't miss practice last week leading up to Denver's win at Oakland, though he had just five catches for 55 yards with two drops, indicating the injury may have affected him. Thomas missed the first five weeks of the 2011 season with Achilles and finger injuries but hasn't missed a game since.\n© Wesley Hitt/Getty Images Arian Foster of the Houston Texans stands on the sideline during a game against the Tennessee Titans on Oct. 26 in Nashville, Tenn. Arian Foster\nAlthough he is still battling a persistent groin injury, the Texans running back is expected to make his third appearance this season against the Jaguars on Sunday.\nFoster was a limited participant in practice this week as he continues to progress from surgery in August. He was struck in the head by Colts linebacker D'Qwell Jackson at the end of the first half of last Thursday's loss, but returned to the field after missing just one play. Coach Bill O'Brien on Wednesday denied reports Foster was not properly evaluated for a concussion on the sideline before returning. Foster passed the concussion tests at halftime and played the rest of the game.\nFoster played 32 snaps in his first game back from injury and worked up to 46 in his second. The Texans had limited his reps in an attempt to avoid setbacks. He is poised to break out Sunday after recording just 51 yards on 21 attempts in two games.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-10-14/tyrod-taylor-inury-update-could-start-mcl-sprain-rex-ryan-bills-bengals", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4658345-nfl-week-6-photos-pictures-falcons-saints-julio-jones-michael-mauti-mark-ingram", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-10-15/sammy-watkins-complains-injury-buffalo-bills-offense-rex-ryan", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-10-14/texans-coach-bill-obrien-arian-foster-concussion-properly-evaluated", "http://linemakers.sportingnews.com/list/4658366-nfl-picks-betting-lines-spreads-odds-week-6-vegas-broncos-browns-redskins-jets", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/fantasy/nfl/story/2015-10-13/week-6-fantasy-football-rankings-quarterbacks-tom-brady-deflategate-patriots-colts-sleepers-matchups"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:51:08.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
