(Photo: Daniel Mears, Detroit News)\nA few hours after the Seattle Seahawks announced that star running back Marshawn Lynch wouldn't play Monday night, the Lions confirmed that one of their top players would miss the game, too.\nThe Lions announced that linebacker DeAndre Levy was downgraded from doubtful to out for the game in Seattle (8:30 p.m., ESPN). Levy also did not travel with the team, which he had for the previous road games this season.\nLevy, who's dealing with a hip injury, will miss his fourth straight game despite returning to practice last week. Josh Bynes will continue starting at weak-side linebacker.\nOffensive tackle Corey Robinson (ankle) is also out after being listed as doubtful Saturday.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com\ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4cb81919461cda088254ebc2e56cdb176818771c/c=0-0-732-976&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/08/06/DetroitNews/DetroitNews/635744759876806963-2015-0806-dm-lions-practice0168.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/08/06/DetroitNews/DetroitNews/635744759876806963-2015-0806-dm-lions-practice0168.jpg", "http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-05T06:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:56:18.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
