UFC President Dana White has previously said Jones likely would get an immediate title shot against Daniel Cormier, who claimed the light heavyweight belt after Jones' ban.\n\"We've made it clear to Jon that this new opportunity to compete in UFC is a privilege and not a right, and that there are significant expectations we have regarding his conduct moving forward,\" UFC Chairman and CEO Lorenzo Fertitta said in a statement. \"We're happy to read and see reports that he has embraced the terms of his plea agreement and is using this experience to grow and develop as a person.\"\nJones is the brother of former Syracuse University football stars and current NFL players Chandler Jones , a defensive end with the New England Patriots, and Arthur Jones , a defensive tackle with the Indianapolis Colts.\nThe 28-year-old Jones (21-1) was considered the most dominant champion in MMA until his turbulent personal life knocked him out of the cage. He has won 12 straight fights since his only loss on a sketchy disqualification, and he defended his 205-pound title eight consecutive times after winning it in March 2011 to become the youngest champion in UFC history.\nJones beat the previously unbeaten Cormier by a clear unanimous decision in January at UFC 182, but his string of misbehaviors culminated six months ago in that crash in Albuquerque, where the upstate New York native lives and trains.\nPolice say officers were told by witnesses that Jones ran from a crash that hospitalized a pregnant motorist and then returned to his rental car to grab a wad of cash, leaving behind a pipe with marijuana and rental car documents in his name.\nJones pleaded guilty last month to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident involving injury. He will serve up to 18 months of supervised probation, but his plea deal kept a felony conviction off his record.\n\"I am thankful to be able to do what I love once again, and I look forward to proving myself as a champion in and outside of the octagon,\" Jones said in a statement.\nCormier assumed the title forfeited by Jones when he defeated Anthony \"Rumble\" Johnson by submission in May, and he defended the belt earlier this month with a thrilling split-decision victory over Alexander Gustafsson at UFC 192. Gustafsson also provided Jones' toughest test of Jones' career, losing a narrow unanimous decision in September 2013.\nCormier realizes the belt won't truly belong to him unless he defeats Jones. The veteran wrestler has repeatedly called on Jones to correct his behavior to set up their rematch, which seems likely to be held early next year.\nJones has kept a low public profile since his suspension, only occasionally popping up on social media. His training partners in Greg Jackson's Albuquerque gym have praised his attitude during his time away from MMA.\nBut Jones has a long history of slip-ups in behavior, occasionally landing him in legal trouble.\nJones tested positive for cocaine use three days after his victory over Cormier in January, but spent just one day in a treatment facility for drug abuse before checking himself out.\nJones was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated in Binghamton, New York, in 2012 after smashing his Bentley into a pole. He eventually pleaded guilty and avoided jail time.\nJones and Cormier were involved in a brawl in a casino lobby in August while promoting their bout, with Jones rushing Cormier off the stage and into a crowd of fans. The Nevada Athletic Commission fined both fighters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:49:29.445+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
