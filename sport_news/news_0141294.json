And that's huge for our team.\" \nThe Ravens moved forward from an opening half that saw them allow goals by Maggie Tidwell and Kaylan Gruber and manage only three shots themselves. \nWhile it took a bit more time for goals to show up, the intent was there from the start of the second half. Beverly Brittingham launched a solid shot — one of four from her on the day — right at MSJ goalkeeper Lindsey Sturwold in the 50th minute. \nAnderson finally broke through in the 78th minute, when Halley Embree took a pass from Hannah Wegley from about 15 yards out and rifled it home. It was Embree's team-leading fourth goal of the season. \nIn the 84th minute, Tiffany Simcox weaved around a Lions defender and fired a shot that Sturwold deflected. Katie Frazer was there for the rebound, and the contest was tied. \nMSJ surged back in front three minutes later, and to stay, on Gruber's second goal of the game, as she dribbled by Destiny Crawford and beat keeper Allyson Saylor. \n\"It's unfortunate (the Lions got) a lucky break at the end,\" Myhre said. \"The team battled hard, and the back line was strong. I'm pleased with the fight and the effort, but we got an unlucky break, and it was unfortunate we couldn't pull it off.\" \nMSJ (7-4-1, 2-1 HCAC) had a 14-10 shot advantage, but the Ravens had seven in the second half to five for the Lions. Saylor was credited with eight saves. \n\"We still continue to fight and battle hard,\" Myhre said. \"Hopefully this will carry this fight into our next game. There are a lot more games left to play. So we've got to take it one game at a time. It's one bump on the road, but we'll build back on it and get the next one.\" \nAnderson plays Defiance on Wednesday at Macholtz Stadium at 7 p.m. Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:20:30.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
