We try to get to know a little about them and their favorite players and try to make it individualized.” \nThe Pro Hogs Clinic also had made a stop in West Plains, Mo., the previous weekend. Former Razorbacks outfielder Matt Vinson, who was a 37th-round pick of the Arizona Diamondbacks, said the amount of campers at the Mountain Home event was perfect. \n“If we can bring more pros with us, we could make it higher,” said Vinson, an Alma native. “We don’t want to have like 300 kids with only a few instructors. We like our stations to have around five or six kids. Today was perfect and went exactly how we wanted.” \nIt was Suggs and Vinson who decided to start the traveling baseball clinic last year. Suggs is one of three instructors currently in the Miami organization. Utility player Brian Anderson and pitcher Blake Logan also are in the Marlins farm system. \nAnderson stresses the value of playing multiple positions to the campers. \n“I played second base my last year, and shortstop and third base before that,” Anderson said of his time at Arkansas. “That’s something I think gets lost a lot nowadays. A lot of kids think ‘I’m a shortstop’ or ‘I’m a second baseman.’ When you get to pro ball, it really adds value to you. If you’re in double-A and the triple-A team needs a player, they might bring you up over a guy that can play only one position. \n“It adds versatility, but for me it also makes the game fun,” he added. “When you play multiple positions, it’s not as routine and it mixes it up every day. It’s something I did growing up. No matter what position you’re playing, there are certain fundamentals the kids need to get down. That’s what we’re trying to instill.” \nVinson also is no stranger to playing multiple positions, and says the camp is designed to teach fundamentals and drills the players can take home with them and do regularly. \n“That’s why, today, we played the kids everywhere,” he said. “We don’t just say, ‘hey, shortstops, go with this guy here.’ There’s only one shortstop for each team, so they’re not going to be there all the way up.” \nFormer Arkansas pitcher Trey Killian, the Norfork native and Mountain Home High grad who was selected in the ninth round by Colorado, was designated for assignment to the Rockies’ instructional league, but there was one instructor from the Rockies organization at the clinic who is very familiar with the Twin Lakes Area. \nLeft-handed pitcher Trent Daniel, a 17th-round pick of Colorado, reminisced of his Bryant Black Sox American Legion team’s annual trips to the Twin Lakes Classic. \n“We came up here every summer for the tournament,” Daniel said. “We always looked forward to it. It was a blast. We won it a couple times, and we played that state tournament here. I’m familiar with the drive up here.” \nDaniel’s Bryant team won the 2007 American Legion State championship held at Cooper Park, less than two months after winning its second straight Twin Lakes Classic. \n“We went all the way to the World Series that year, and it all started here, beating Fayetteville in that championship,” he recalled. “I played in junior college with like four of those Fayetteville guys and we ended up being teammates at Fort Smith.” \nDaniel said there are plans for the Pro Hogs to come back to Mountain Home next fall as well. \n“This is the first in Mountain Home. We started in West Plains last weekend and did one there last year,” he said. “We’re definitely going to come back next year, and we’re going to do one in Bryant, too. I’m looking forward to that one.” 40 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.baxterbulletin.com/story/sports/2015/10/12/learning-pros/73837172/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:24:53.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
