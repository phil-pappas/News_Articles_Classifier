The way to get back into the game is by scoring the runs as well. \n\"We knew that would happen and the wicket did start deteriorating and it spun quite a lot on the last day. We can be very proud of it. The moment is quite bittersweet when you're only 20 runs short and we'd have liked another three overs but obviously we understand their decision. \n\"To get back in the game we knew we had to put the pressure back on Pakistan. Either getting close to them or going past them and then on the last day you never know. It's always strange when you go into the last day knowing you can't lose the game and the pressures is all on the opposition. \nAnd Cook paid tribute to Rashid after the leg-spinner recovered from his first-innings nought for 163 to put England into a position to attempt to push for the win. \nCook added: \"It was brilliant from Rash; the criticism he got from the first innings was very unfair, it was a very flat wicket and the spinners didn't come into it until the end of the fourth day and the way he handled that was great and we saw there at the end he's a very fine bowler. \n\"We played a good game. Pakistan did as well but they were a bit sloppy today and we put them under pressure. The game always does speed up here in the subcontinent and you've got to stay in it those first three or four days. \n\"At the end of the day the series is 0-0. You win on points but that's irrelevant but great credit to the lads.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:15:10.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
