Vierra didn’t have to imagine the taste of victory Friday night after he rushed for 268 yards and three touchdowns to help lead the Mustangs to a 40-27 Mother Lode League victory over the Lions at Linden High. “(Vierra) was a one-man show who was hard to get tackled,” Argonaut coach Gary Landergen said. “His success come directly from the weight room. There were a couple of days there when he was the only one lifting. I love to see it pay off for a kid who does everything a program asks of him.” Argonaut (3-5, 1-3 MLL) signal-caller Chad Floyd kept Linden (1-7, 0-4) guessing early by pulling the ball in and instead found himself running for key first downs. Floyd rushed for 89 yards on 18 carries and completed 7 of 10 passes for 136 yards and a pair of touchdowns — a 10-yarder to Jakob White for the game’s first score and a 45-yard toss to Ryan Albiani to close out the first half with a 26-6 lead. The biggest play of the game came on the first play of the second quarter when Vierra got a good block at the line and raced 97 yards for an electrifying touchdown. “I’m starting to see the holes and am running narrower,” Viera said. “I got a good block at the front and read the linebacker coming and cut outside. I couldn’t believe I was running that long.” Linden responded with Hunter White’s 70-yard touchdown run basically untouched up the middle on the Lions’ first play from scrimmage to pull within 7-6 after a missed extra point on the slippery field. White rushed for 134 yards on 13 carries and reeled in a 25-yard touchdown pass from Linden quarterback Anthony Craven midway through the third quarter. Vierra finished off a 75-yard drive with a 39-yard scamper into the end zone off a couple of missed tackles for a 14-6 lead with 6:28 left in the quarter. Argonaut rushed for 401 yards on 41 carries while Linden rushed for 184 yards on 40 carries. Lions back Max Nicol added a six-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter and caught an 18-yard touchdown pass from Craven with 21 seconds left in the game. “Our kids played hard,” Linden coach Mark Miller said. “They played awesome in the second half. I was proud of them.” By Scott Niendorf", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:27:22.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
