Then my hammies. Then my adductors. I couldn't move off the training table,\" Dellavedova said as he recently recalled the moments after the Cavs' Game 3 victory over the Golden State Warriors last spring. \"I was stuck on the table. I had the IV in and I was still cramping. They helped me to the cold tub and I just collapsed in it for 20 minutes.\"In the euphoria, it perhaps went unnoticed just what sort of price Dellavedova paid after that Game 3 performance. The Cavs' doctors were concerned enough with the severe cramping that they called for a stretcher and sent him to the Cleveland Clinic for overnight IVs to get him rehydrated. He wasn't released until the following afternoon. \"I probably pushed it a little. I thought I'd pushed it before but there was just so much on the line,\" Dellavedova said. \"I wasn't scared. What was scary was how am I going to prepare for the next game? I only had one day's rest between the games. I told them I didn't need to go to the hospital, but then I thought to myself 'What would happen if these cramps happened again in the middle of the night?' I would've been screwed.\" \nThis is what fans expect of their favorite players, and there's no question that Dellavedova gave his all to the Cavaliers last season.
