Coach Josh Shaw thinks the game was an outlier for his team, and he has spent the week focusing on getting back to what has made Cherokee successful.“I’ve never been a part of a game like last week where the wheels just completely fell off,” Shaw said. “When you watch last week’s film, the game was a culmination of every position having mental errors and miscues. We had guys not doing things that they had been doing successfully the entire season. We’ve spent this week focused on improving everybody, including our coaches.”As much as Cherokee struggled last week, that has been the story of the season for Milton (1-5, 1-3), which went 11-2 last season on its way to a Region 5 title and an appearance in the state quarterfinals, only to lose many of its top players.Despite those numbers, Shaw said Milton is not as far off from last year’s team, and Cherokee will have to bring its best to win.“Every game is extremely tough in this region,” he said. “They’re not just going to lay down and let us roll over them. I know coach (Howie) DeCristofaro isn’t going to allow them to have a letdown just because they’ve been struggling. Milton is a good football team, regardless of their record. They’re well-coached, and they have some players who are going to give us some problems.”What concerns Shaw the most is Milton’s defense. Led by defensive lineman Ralph Johnson III, linebacker Kyle McGregor and safety R’Shawn Moe, the Eagles have recorded 14 sacks and 44 tackles for loss.Shaw said it will come down to fundamentals and execution for Cherokee to get its offense going again behind running back Brittain Brown, quarterback Nolan Donley and outside playmakers Montrell Washington and Aaron Knowles.“Defensively, (Milton is) still extremely talented,” Shaw said. “They have some really good players on that side of the ball. We just have to be fundamentally sound in our alignments. Our players have to play within our scheme and execute the things that they’re coached to do.”Cherokee’s defense will also be challenged tonight. Although Milton has scored only 12 points per game this season, Shaw said the Eagles’ dynamic backfield combination of SMU-bound quarterback David Moore and running back Cameron Adams could cause his team some problems.“Offensively, Moore is an electric playmaker, and he has the ability to run and pass,” he said. “We’re just going to get back to trying to execute and controlling ourselves. We just have to get back to the fundamentals and put ourselves in a position to make plays.”That dynamic attack will put pressure on the Cherokee defense, where it has talent and experience. Senior Dwayne Tiller leads the Warriors with five sacks from the line, while junior linebacker Jack Carroll leads the team with a county-best 78 tackles and senior Chance Smith leads the Cherokee secondary with two interceptions, one of which was returned for a score. That leadership could be key for Cherokee to keep Milton’s offense from breaking out.“We have some guys who have been here before,” Shaw said. “We know that this game is our most important one because it’s the next one. We’re ready to put last week behind us and move forward.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:22:22.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
