She said she screamed for somebody else to get the eye drops out of her purse, and a man grabbed the nail glue instead of the eye drops and poured it into her eye.\nShe said she called 911 as soon as she felt it burn. The glue immediately sealed her eye shut.\nGaydos went to the doctor, but was initially refused when she couldn't pay for treatment.\nHer eye remained glued shut for over a week. After a news story ran about her plight, the doctor called her back and managed to reopen her eye.\nGaydos said the doctor told her she would regain her vision in a few days and her eye would eventually be fine.\nHer eye, swollen and painful, was difficult to open after the glue was cleared, but Gaydos said it feels a lot better than when it was glued shut.\nCopyright 2015 WPBF via CNN.
