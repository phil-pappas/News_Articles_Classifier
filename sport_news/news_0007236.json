I have said before that it doesn’t matter what role it is, as long as I can contribute to the team and help us win the World Cup. Even if it is from the bench … it doesn’t matter, the team comes first.” \nMatfield also said that South Africa must be wary of the threat posed by Wales, who beat a second-string Springboks 12-6 when the teams last met in Cardiff at the end of 2014. \n“Wales are a very good team. We have heard for the last six years that they know how to beat us, so they are confident when they play us,” he said. \n“They had a good victory over us last year and it’s now the quarter-finals — any team can beat any team.” \nHowever, Matfield believes that the additional pressure of the knockout phase could work to South Africa’s advantage, given that they have effectively been playing knockout rugby since the shock defeat to Japan in their opening pool match. \n“What’s nice going into the quarter-finals is that everybody is under the same pressure,” he said. “We have been there for the last two or three weeks now, functioning under the pressure.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T11:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:24:06.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
