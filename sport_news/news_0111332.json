Both people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Saturday because the team hasn't announced the move. \nThe 35-year-old Klentak was the Angels' assistant general manager since November 2011. He replaces Ruben Amaro Jr., who was fired in September by new team president Andy MacPhail. \nKlentak previously worked for MacPhail in Baltimore as the Orioles' director of baseball operations from 2008-11. He then served as the No. 2 man behind GM Jerry DiPoto for four seasons. Klentak interviewed for DiPoto's job after he resigned this summer, but the Angels hired Billy Eppler earlier this month. \nThe Phillies finished with the worst record in baseball at 63-99 and underwent major changes on and off the field during the season. \nRyne Sandberg resigned as manager in June and Pete Mackanin was hired to replace him after serving in the interim role for a few months. MacPhail later took over as president for Pat Gillick, who returned to his advisory role with the club. \nKlentak, who played baseball at Dartmouth, began his career in the majors as a front-office intern with Colorado. He then worked in Major League Baseball's Labor Relations Department until MacPhail first hired him in March 2008. \nKlentak has a strong analytics background and experience in contract negotiations.
