The first was Richard Verma, the United States’ Ambassador to India. Though 25th in the long row of distinguished envoys, he is the first one of “Indian origin”. Carrying this Indian-origin tag lightly, he was perfectly at ease and deftly evaded difficult questions. He has been in India for about six months and has apparently learnt the art of making Indians feel good, especially when it comes to the US-Pakistan relationship. New Delhi has always been a challenging assignment for American diplomats. Verma has a difficult job on his hands. As it was for some of his many brilliant predecessors. Indeed, India has been lucky to have had a string of very distinguished Americans as Washington’s envoys. Chester Bowles had two innings in New Delhi. During his first term, from 1951 to 1953, the Bowles were a popular couple in New Delhi’s diplomatic circles. He became the very antithesis of what would later on be termed “the ugly American”. In those early days, life in New Delhi was simple. Mrs and Mr Bowles used to arrive at diplomatic receptions on their bikes, whereas the Soviet Ambassador would always be travelling in an imposing black limousine. Chester Bowles came back for the second tenure, a longer one, between 1963 and 1968. India at the time was in great transition and turmoil — Nehru’s death, Shastri’s succession, the 1965 India-Pakistan war, and another succession. Being the quintessential liberal, he was an ardent friend of India. Bowles’ book, A View from New Delhi, gives a good overview of India’s difficulties and dilemmas in those crucial years. John Kenneth Galbraith, the great economist, was another towering figure among Verma’s predecessors. Professor Galbraith was President Kennedy’s personal choice. Perhaps, one of the reasons for Kennedy picking him was that Galbraith was well versed with India’s economic issues. In the mid-1950s, he had spent time in Calcutta at Prof PC Mahalanobis’ Indian Statistical Institute (when the Second Five-Year Plan was being conceptualised). A man of great wisdom and greater wit, his book Ambassador’s Journal is an insightful peep into India in Nehru’s years of declining popularity, especially in the aftermath of the India-China conflict. But perhaps the most flamboyant of US Ambassadors has to be Daniel Patrick Moynihan. A scholar and showman par excellence, Moynihan was not intimidated by Indira Gandhi. At the same time, he was fighting an internal battle with the Nixon-Kissinger foreign policy establishment against Washington’s unhelpful attitude towards New Delhi. Neither Bowles nor Galbraith nor Moynihan was averse to being called “a friend of India”. After the trio, all that changed. There was a string of indifferent envoys — defeated senators, unwanted cabinet members, etc. The India-US relationship was redefined after the 1991 “economic reforms”. Verma’s presence today at the elegant Roosevelt House in Chanakyapuri is a reaffirmation of both a changed America and a changed India. Verma represents the self-assurance of a multicultural society. Only a President like Barack Obama could think of sending an “Indian origin” man as his envoy to New Delhi. Verma also showcases the United States’ evolution as a merit society. Irrespective of his ethnic background, he could work — and work his way up — in that most intricate and byzantine bureaucratic-political arena: the US Congressional staff. That the Senate majority leader would have him as his adviser on national security matters speaks of his competence, as also of the senator’s confidence in him. And, then as Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs — that is probably equivalent of the Parliamentary Affairs Minister — Verma provided a bridge between the White House and the Congress. He could land that job only because of his intimate knowledge of politics, politicians and personalities, as also a mastery of committee rules and protocol. In the interaction with my senior colleagues on Wednesday, Verma was impressive. He presented himself as an ambassador of goodwill, not as a missionary out to proselyte. He is the new American. And, India too has changed much since 1991 and has especially become deeply self-assured in its interactions with the Americans after the 2007 nuclear agreement. Verma should feel at home and at ease in this new India. The other visitor on Wednesday was Dr Dharamvir Gandhi, Member of the Lok Sabha from Patiala. If Verma was an embodiment of cultivated discretion, Gandhi came across as utterly spontaneous, unrehearsed, a charming Mr Sincerity. I was meeting Dr Gandhi for the first time, and was very pleased to have had the opportunity. Having been a journalist for more than three decades, I am not easily impressed. But Dr Gandhi totally overwhelmed my professional skepticism with his humble persona. His simple and unassuming appearance camouflaged a passionate, restless soul. He came across as a very fine specimen of civil society, willing to question the “authority” and its presumed claim to wisdom — and, unwilling to put up with whatever is being dished out to it by powerful politicians. That a total “outsider” could get elected to the Lok Sabha is a tribute to him, as also to the people of Punjab and their daring willingness to experiment with new ideas and fresh faces. There is a small problem, though. Personalities like Dr Gandhi can only be solo players. Their strength — liberal temperament, democratic values, commitment to the common man — becomes a cause for unhappiness. A Dr Gandhi would always chafe at the organisational constraints that a political party requires of its members. And, this dilemma is at the heart of his trouble with Arvind Kejriwal and his designated subedars in Punjab. Anyway, he had come to talk about the drug problem in Punjab. He is passionate but unsentimental in diagnosing the menace. The problem, according to him, began when the NDPS Act was passed in 1985, criminalising the use of cheap and natural intoxicants like cannabis. This ban has, by now, led to the emergence of a politician-police-drug mafia nexus. His solution: decriminalise and deregulate, and let the market competition ensure cheaper and safer drugs. Suddenly, we seem to be flooded with “memoirs” from a number of former public servants and constitutional functionaries. This is a new trend, and a welcome one. How much to speak or reveal is a difficult question. The dilemma presents itself in TV Rajeswar’s book India: The Crucial Years. I have known and respected Mr Rajeswar over the years as one of the thoughtful “establishment” figures, and whatever he has to say as an insider about the critical events would merit close consideration and scrutiny. He represents that genre of Intelligence officers who have a mastery in the craft of “analysis”. In this book, he refers to a brief but terse quarrel he had with the former President of India, R Venkataraman, another “establishment” man. Venkataraman belonged to that category of public servants who are called “survivors”. It seems that when Venkataraman published his memoirs My Presidential Years, Rajeswar felt “it was not proper for the former President to have referred to my confidential discussion with him on these issues, especially since the main players were still active in politics”. (Rajeswar was the Governor of Sikkim in 1987 when he had his “confidential discussion” at Rashtrapati Bhavan). As per his account, Rajeswar chose to correct the former President and politely chastise him for being less than discreet. But, Venkataraman was not the one to let grass grow under his feet and — as per Rajeswar’s account — promptly and “condescendingly” ticked Rajeswar off. This time, Rajeswar writes, he did not join issue. “I left the matter at that.” It is fun to learn how these two old warhorses jousted. My working day begins with a kind of Kaffeeklatsch with two senior colleagues, SS Tej, Editor of Punjabi Tribune, and Santosh Tiwari, Editor of Dainik Tribune. The other day, we were discussing the courage of writers in the region. It is indeed heartening to note that so many Punjabi and other writers have stood up to be counted in protest against the rising tide of intolerance. However, both my colleagues often express a sense of dissatisfaction over the absence of vibrant and robust regional voices in the region. They point out while there is too much of fiction writing — poetry, story and satire — there are few writers expressing themselves on basic moral and social issues facing our society. My own sense is that there must be young, undiscovered writers in Hindi as also in Punjabi, reflecting the turmoil and transition in the new Haryana, new Punjab and new Himachal Pradesh. On behalf of The Tribune group of publications, I invite Hindi and Punjabi voices to join our family of writers. We have no prejudices, no partisan affiliation, only a commitment to secular values and democratic institutions. We welcome any argument, well made and cogently reasoned. I apologise that this is a somewhat delayed response to a very valid complaint from one of our readers. It appears that last month, The Tribune gave Ravipal Singh, a well-known orthopaedic surgeon, and his wife (who is an eye specialist) of Amritsar a cause to nurse a grievance. Their son, Avi Singh, had topped the Armed Forces Medical College entrance examination, “perhaps the first boy in nearly a decade” to have achieved this distinction in Amritsar. However, Dr Ravipal Singh’s grouse was that The Tribune did not mention that Avi had achieved the “top” distinction, and merely noted his “selection”. It was indeed an editing lapse. The proud parents are probably entitled to feel that their son’s achievement was “undervalued”. I can only hope that Avi will keep up the good work and continue to make his parents proud. My congratulations to the family.
