(AP Photo/Kirsty Wigglesworth) more > By   \nLONDON (AP) - The latest at the Rugby World Cup (all times local): \n8.50 p.m. \nJulian Savea has scored two of New Zealand’s four tries to help the defending champions to a 29-13 lead over France at halftime in the Rugby World Cup quarterfinals in Cardiff. \nLock Brodie Retallick charged down Frederic Michalak’s clearance to pull clear for the All Blacks’ first try, before winger Nehe Milner-Skudder cut inside off the left, beat two Frenchmen and cruised over. \nThen it was the Savea show, as the left winger took an offload from Dan Carter for the third try and bulldozed over two covering defenders to crash over for a stunning fourth just before halftime. \nNo. 8 Louis Picamoles went over for France’s sole try between Savea’s scores. \nThe winner plays South Africa in the semifinals at Twickenham. \n___ \n7.30 p.m. \nFrance captain Thierry Dusautoir was forced on the eve of the quarterfinals to bat away a story in a newspaper back home that his team has lost faith in coach Philippe Saint-Andre. \nThere’s no such concern inside the All Blacks, with players and coach Steve Hansen content with their progress this tournament after four wins from four in the pool stage, while acknowledging the team has yet to reach its usual high standards. \nIt’s all part of a grand plan, according to Hansen, who is on the field with his assistants under the Millennium Stadium’s closed roof as some of his players practice their kicks and perform stretches. Hansen shook hands with Saint-Andre in the center circle after France’s players jogged out. \nFrom now on, every New Zealand match could be the last for captain Richie McCaw and flanker Daniel Carter - two of the greatest players to wear the All Black jersey. McCaw will be fresh after sitting out the last pool game. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:08:26.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
