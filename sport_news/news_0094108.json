A late FG led Williams Field to the win. (Photo: 12 Sports) \nWith the game on the line Friday night, Gilbert Williams Field's Brandon Ruiz was remarkable calm, especially for a kicker lining up for a 51-yard try. \nWell, maybe focused is a better way to describe it. \n\"On the sidelines there was so much support,\"he said. \"Every guy came up to me and was giving me hugs and saying \"I believe in you.'So when I walked on that field, I had them all on my mind. They played a hell of a game out here and I knew I had to do it for them.\" \nRuiz drilled the ball right through the uprights for the go-ahead sore with 31.7 second to go. Williams Field's defense would tack one touchdown on the board on the following drive when Justis Stokes ran an interception back for a score as time expired and the Black Hawks escaped with a 43-35 victory over Mesa at Williams Field High School. \nAfter a back-and-forth second half that saw seven lead changes, Mesa reclaimed the lead with 2:21 to go, scoring on a lateral pass from Jackson Clement to Dylan Hendricks. Williams Field's offense prepared for another counter-attack but stalled near midfield to put the game in Ruiz'hands. \n\"Well I knew I was going to make it,\"Ruiz said. \"I was so happy. Someone picked me up right away so I wasn't really able to celebrate, but it was amazing.\" \nMesa jumped out to a15-0 lead early Friday, before Williams Field came roaring back with two touchdowns in the second quarter. The Jackrabbits led 15-13 at halftime. \nThe Black Hawks scored on their opening second half drive with a 20-yard run by Aaron Mason to take their first lead of the game, but Mesa would answer right back, regaining the lead on 38-yard touchdown pass from Roberto Baeza to Clement. \nAnd that's how the final two quarters would goâ€”with each defense waiting to be the one to make that critical stop. But just when it seemed like Williams Field's offense had run out of gas, Ruiz was there to save the day. \nStokes last-second pick six was the icing on the cake Friday. He said his team expected a dog fight from Mesa. \n\"Like coach (Steve) Campbell said, they were 6-1 just like us so someone had to come out 6-2,\"he said. \"We just had to come out and fight. It was closer than we wanted it to be, but you got to do what you got to do.\" \nStokes finished the night with two touchdowns. \nFriday's win marked Williams Field's second edge-of-your-seat victory in the last three weeks, having also defeated rival Gilbert Higley in the final seconds on October 2nd. The Black Hawks made the jump to Division II this season and have gone undefeated against division opponents thus far with the team's only loss coming in Week Two against Division I opponent Phoenix Desert Vista. \nBut, the biggest test for the Black Hawks might still be ahead of them. The team will face top-ranked Mesa Skyline (8-0) next week. \n\"We got to come out focused, detail-oriented and just focus all the way through,\"Stokes said.
