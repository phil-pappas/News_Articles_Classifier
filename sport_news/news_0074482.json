But it didn't defy science, which is why the folks at ESPN Sports Science broke down the 41-yard touchdown grab with a 95-second video. \nStill, it wasn't enough for some. \n\"I'm still in a state of disbelief,\" Stanford coach David Shaw said at his Tuesday press conference. \"I don't know how he did it. I think the ESPN Sports Science piece is phenomenal, because they zoom in and you watch his hands -- and without being able to see it, you see his hand at the perfect time clamp on to the football. That's just phenomenal. We watched it again with the players and it was the same reaction, which was just, 'Wow.' \" \nESPN Sports Science host John Brenkus explained how Owusu, whose sight on the ball was blocked for the final 10 feet of downward trajectory, had a catch window of .02 seconds. \n\"I think John said it best, I used the V5 area in my brain,\" said Owusu, referring to a region in the visual cortex that allowed him to subconsciously make the complex calculations to complete the trajectory of the throw. \nHis older brother Chris Owusu, a wide receiver with the New York Jets who also played at Stanford, was more succinct via the phone. \n\"I got a text from him the day after and it just said, 'Excellent catch, period,' \" Francis said. \"Some brotherly love, but it's funny. It's good.\" Advertisement \nCount cornerback Ronnie Harris, a fifth-year senior, among those stunned by what could be dubbed the catch of the year in college football. \n\"Right after the game I was scrambling to get to that tape and see how he made that catch,\" Harris said. \"I've seen him make some unbelievable catches at practice, but nothing of that magnitude.\" \nA least a tiny portion of the credit belongs to Stanford quarterback and wide receivers coach Tavita Pritchard, who installed a distraction drill where a player's vision is blurred during routes. \n\"For that split second, you gotta track it, see where it's gonna land and you just gotta mentally prepare for it,\" said Owusu, who during warmups will envision himself making one-handed grabs a la New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. \nThe most recent highlight-reel catch against UCLA at Stanford Stadium belonged to Kodi Whitfield, who snatched a pass between two defenders with his right hand in 2013. \n\"We joke around, we say, 'Who's better?' \" Owusu said. \"I'm a little biased. I say mine.\" \nAfter seeing his name scroll across ESPN, is Owusu ready to give up all of the attention? \n\"I will miss it a little,\" said Owusu, who stayed up until 4 or 5 a.m. writing a paper for a communication class after the game. \"It's kind of fun having the cameras around me, I'm enjoying it. But at the same time, I'm still keeping my head down and I'm going to keep going to work every day, support my other teammates.\" \n\"He's pretty even keel,\" Shaw said. \"I don't know that he was ready for it to take a life of its own as it has. The best thing about him right now is I don't think he's carrying it around, there's no added weight on his shoulders. I think he just sees it as kind of cool and kind of fun.\" Email Vytas Mazeika at vmazeika@dailynewsgroup.com ; follow him at Twitter.com/dailynewsvytas .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:24:26.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
