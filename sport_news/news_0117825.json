For a moment there, reading Steven Meisenbach’s letter of Sept. 18 (“McDonald’s egg pledge is a small step”), I thought it was talking about abortion clinics.\nSoon the Christmas season will be upon us and congregations will hear sermons about King Herod and the slaughter of the innocents. King Herod was a piker when compared to what America is doing.\nHow can Hillary Clinton cuddle her grandchild while at the same time pushing for late term abortions and the sale of baby parts?\nGod have mercy upon us and restore our sanity and compassion.\nJEAN BROWN\nSavannah\nLetter writer applauds Tybee’s no-shows\nWill you please quit pontificating about the Tybee candidates who chose to boycott the so called “Candidates Forum”? The primary sponsor, Forever Tybee, is a political action committee (PAC) and as such, comes to the table with an agenda.\nBarry Brown, Wanda Doyle and Stephen Friedman asked multiple times for changes to the forum’s “rules” in order to ensure that Forever Tybee’s agenda would not dominate the public meeting. Prime example, they asked that all candidates answer the same questions. Forever Tybee refused. I applaud the candidates for not letting themselves walk into that ambush.\nAs for your conduct, shame on you. I was there and Tom Barton did not act like an impartial moderator — key word here is impartial. The snide comments during the forum were uncalled for.\nAre you in Forever Tybee’s pocket?\nJOHN BRANIGIN\nTybee Island\nI want to be able to shoot back\nI have to comment on Pepi Streiff’s letter about “reasonable gun control” (“Save a life — arm yourself,” Oct. 16). Guns don’t kill people — bad people with guns kill people!\nGuns are a tool; they have no power of their own; they simply do what the person holding them wants. Stricter laws will not solve the crime wave, all that will accomplish is to discern the honest people.\nCriminals do not obtain their guns via legal purchase from a legal dealer; for criminals, it is already illegal for them to own a gun. They will continue to have guns despite any laws we pass.\nFor myself, if I am threatened by a “bad man” with a gun, I want to be able to shoot back!\nSTEVEN LEVAN\nSavannah\nDon’t let distasteful ‘comics’ into the paper\nThe personal assault by Garry Trudeau on Donald Trump in the “comics” section in a recent edition is disgusting, vile and totally “over the top.”\nNow, I am hardly a fan of Mr. Trump, but I found Mr. Trudeau’s depiction of him hateful and not something your publication should tolerate — comic syndications notwithstanding. Shame on your editorial board — you can and must do better. This is not a Frist Amendment issue or one of censorship or of political satire; it is a matter of common decency, something woefully lost in today’s world.\nBear in mind, we have many months remaining in the presidential race — please do not let distasteful work by Trudeau be part of your coverage/reporting of the race.\nSincerely,\nRAYMOND W. STONE\nBluffton, S.C.\nAmerica already has enough problems\nYour recent editorial was right on regarding the “reckless endangerment” we will go through if our administration gets its way on allowing thousands of refugees to come to our shores (“Editorial: Syrian refugee response: Reckless endangerment,” Sept. 23). As if you don’t have enough problems with so many Hispanics here illegally.\nI do take umbrage with the pope advocating that the USA should do its best in allowing more refugees in. It is complete naiveté not to recognize the dangers that certain Muslims might bring to us. It is not the business of foreigners to tell us who should arrive on our shores.\nWe have too many problems here already.\nBARBARA PAULE\nSavannah\nSavannah Mall should reconsider no-gun policy\nThe Savannah Mall advertises with a sticker on its entry doors, “No weapons allowed.” Well, this is an invitation to terrorists.\nQuestion to all: Where have many, if not all, of the shooter events taken place? Where it’s “advertised” as a “gun free zone.”\nWe love to eat at the Texas Roadhouse; the food is wonderful!. But due to the entry to the restaurant and the sign on the door, we are done going near that mall.\nAs a responsible, licensed, gun owner, it is my right to protect myself and my family. In today’s environment and the enemy within, I am more watchful of my surroundings and where we go. I hope the mall will reconsider that branding and return to its sanity to give greater security to its patrons.\nI’m done shopping in the Savannah Mall area.\nMARY WIERBICKI\nGuyton\nWhose lives matter?\nWatching the Democratic debates, the candidates were asked if “Black lives matter” or do “All lives matter.” Three answered black lives matter.\nThe way I was brought up, all lives mattered unless you are a murderer, child molester, etc., then you’re life did not matter. You were executed in the electric chair.\nIf only “black lives matter,” then why do they kill each other every day and night in Savannah? If other lives don’t matter (white, Mexican, etc.), then who will pay the taxes, do the work, open new businesses, invent and become higher educated to make this nation great again?\nThe people whose lives don’t matter are the ones who pay the toll for the entitlements, food banks, homeless shelters, police, prisons and our stand-in-line-get-it-for-free programs.\nDo “police lives matter”? Evidently not. They are being killed every day by thugs all over the nation.\nThe cops are trying to protect all citizens that wander from the flock, who can’t protect themselves. If you don’t break the law, then you can live free — literally — if you can stand in line long enough.\nNEAL WHIFIELD\nSavannah", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:02:39.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
