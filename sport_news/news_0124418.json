No, I don't think about that. \n“Because I don't think at this moment I should come here and change the world of football. I'm not strong enough, not smart enough. \n“I'm here as a manager of a football club, one of the best in the world. Now we have to develop our game so our supporters can enjoy our game a little bit more in the future. \n“But I think tonight (Thursday) they had moments they could enjoy. They had moments where the players brought their whole hearts on the pitch. \n“That's what everybody wants. It was not boring. I don't think anyone wanted to go early. \n“We tried our all. And at the end we didn't win. That's the thing. Maybe it wasn't the most world-changing game you ever saw.” \nLiverpool fell behind to a beautifully taken goal by Marko Devic in the 15th minute, but equalised through Emre Can moments after visiting captain Oleg Kuzmin had been sent off for a second bookable offence. \n'98 per cent OK' \nHowever, despite playing with a man extra for 54 minutes, they failed to score a winning goal, with substitute Christian Benteke coming closest with a low shot that came back off the post. \nIt was Liverpool's third consecutive 1-1 draw in Group B, leaving them four points below leaders FC Sion, and meant they have won only once inside 90 minutes in their last 11 matches. \n“Sometimes it's a big advantage against 10 men, but most of the time it's a pretty thankless job,” Klopp told his post-match press conference. \n“We had our moments. We hit the post with Christian, we had some other moments, good chances. At the end, no goal. So I would say 98 per cent OK — not perfect, but OK — and two per cent, the decisive bit, we missed.” \nOn the reception he was granted by Liverpool's fans, Klopp said: “It was one of the best moments for me and it is important for all of us that people don't think it's better I stay outside the stadium. \n“When you come for the first time to a new house, you (normally) have a present. I'm not quite satisfied with my present tonight, but it was only the first time and I will come again. We'll see next time. Maybe it's better.” \nBelgian striker Benteke came through the last 27 minutes unscathed after five games out with a hamstring injury, while Brazilian forward Roberto Firmino made his return following a four-match lay-off with a back problem. \nWith Daniel Sturridge rested as a precaution after taking a knock to the knee in training, it means Klopp will have a much deeper pool of forwards to call upon for Sunday's visit of Southampton. \nRubin coach Valery Chaly took heart from the way his side had responded to the 36th-minute dismissal of Kuzmin, who was shown a second yellow card for impeding Can. \nAsked about spoiling Klopp's big night, he replied: “We're not relatives here to give him some presents. This is football. Both teams gave a decent performance and we're happy with the result.” — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:47:15.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
