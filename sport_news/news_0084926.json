This week he needs to chase Manning. If the Cowboys are to upset the Giants, Hardy needs to catch Manning.\nHardy will have the luxury of lining up against a rookie left tackle making just his sixth NFL start, Ereck Flowers. But Flowers has acquitted himself quite well thus far, as has Manning's entire blocking front.\nThe Giants allowed only seven sacks this season, the fewest in the NFC. Flowers has been victimized for just one of those sacks -- last Monday night by Philadelphia's Brandon Graham.\nManning has thrown 235 passes, so he's been sacked an average of once every 33.5 throws. Manning tossed 54 passes earlier this month against San Francisco without any sacks in a victory over the 49ers.\nThe Giants, like the Cowboys, realized they stood a better chance of winning on Sundays if they could keep their quarterback upright. If you let Manning throw the ball, he'll beat you. His two Super Bowl MVP awards are testimony to that.\nThe Giants won their last Super Bowl during the 2011 season. Since then, they have used two first-round draft picks and a second to upgrade the offensive line. The Giants took Flowers with the ninth overall pick in 2015, Justin Pugh 19th overall in 2013 and center Weston Richburg 43rd overall pick in 2014. All now start for the Giants.\nThe Cowboys were Exhibit A of what the Giants needed to fix. Manning has beaten the Cowboys 11 times in his career and in seven of those victories he was sacked once or fewer. He has lost 12 times to the Cowboys and mixed into those defeats were eight-, five-, four- and a pair of three-sack games.\nThe Giants also changed offensive coordinators in 2014, hiring Ben McAdoo away from the Green Bay Packers to incorporate the quicker passing game that has made Aaron Rodgers a league MVP. So the ball is coming out Manning's hands quicker now and he has blockers in front of him who can slow the rush.\nManning has had problems throughout his career with interceptions. Three times he's led the league in interceptions. But now that he's spent a year in the system, he's acclimated to the rhythm of the offense. So in addition to his sacks, his interceptions are down. He's thrown only four through six games against 11 touchdown passes.\nGive Manning time and he has the receivers to beat you. Odell Beckham Jr. and Rueben Randle are a handful. Beckham went to the Pro Bowl as a rookie in 2014 and both have had 100-yard games this season.\nHardy's two sacks of Tom Brady in his debut against New England earlier this month showed defensive coordinator Rod Marinelli he still has his Pro Bowl skills despite a year layoff. He'll need to put them on display once again at the Meadowlands this weekend because if the Cowboys let Manning play pitch-and-catch with his receivers, the losing streak will reach four games.\nListen to Rick Gosselin at 10:50 a.m. Tuesdays on Sportsradio 1310 AM/96.7 FM The Ticket with Norm Hitzges and Donovan Lewis, and follow @RickGosselinDMN on Twitter.\nLatest Cowboys analysis\nMoore: Weakened by injuries to Dez and Romo, can Cowboys play to their strength?\nSherrington: Monday's 'pitiful display' should reassure nervous Cowboys fans\nGeorge: Cowboys have a chance to make NFC East history Sunday\nSturm: What starting QB Matt Cassel brings to the Cowboys\nGeorge: Could Christine Michael be Cowboys' lead back?
