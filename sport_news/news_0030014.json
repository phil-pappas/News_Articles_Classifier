The decision seemingly ends Platini’s bid to succeed Blatter as FIFA president in the emergency election in February. \nAnother presidential hopeful, Chung Mong -joon, was suspended for six years in a separate case and FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke was banned for 90 days. \nThe International Olympic Committee called on FIFA to consider a “credible external presidential candidate of high integrity” as Blatter’s replacement. “Enough is enough,” IOC President Thomas Bach said. “We hope that now, finally, everyone at FIFA has at last understood that they cannot continue to remain passive.” \nIssa Hayatou , the longtime head of the African soccer confederation who was reprimanded in 2011 by the IOC in a FIFA kickbacks scandal, will become acting president. The 69-year-old Cameroonian, who has a serious kidney illness that requires dialysis, is currently in Yaounde and is expected to travel to Zurich soon. \nThe interim leader of UEFA will be Spanish federation head Angel Maria Villar , who remains at risk of being sanctioned from the FIFA ethics committee in its investigation of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding contests. \nEuro qualifying: Portugal and Northern Ireland booked their places at Euro 2016 on Thursday, and world champion Germany was made to wait after being upset 1-0 by Ireland in Dublin. \nIrish substitute Shane Long ran onto a kick over the German defense from goalkeeper Darren Randolph and blasted past Manuel Neuer to the top corner to ensure Group D will be decided on the final day. \nGermany, Portugal and Ireland are vying for the top two spots to ensure direct qualification. Scotland’s hopes were ended when Robert Lewandowski salvaged a 2-2 draw for Poland in Glasgow. \nMessi faces jail time: Barcelona’s Lionel Messi will stand trial in Spain on three counts of tax fraud and could be sentenced to nearly two years in prison if found guilty. \nA Spanish judge rejected a request to clear the Barcelona player of wrongdoing and decided to charge him and his father, Jorge Horacio Messi , with tax fraud. Prosecutors had said Lionel Messi was not fully aware of his father’s unlawful activities and should not have been charged, but the state attorney’s office contended that he knew enough to also be named in the case. \nThey are being accused of defrauding Spain’s tax office of $4.6 million in unpaid taxes from 2007 through ’09. \nThe attorney’s office called for a prison sentence of 22 months and 15 days for Messi and his father, along with a fine in the amount defrauded. Prosecutors had called for an 18-month prison sentence for Messi’s father only, along with a fine of $2.2 million.
