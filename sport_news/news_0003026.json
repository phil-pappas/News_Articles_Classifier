See the video below. KOAA via YouTube A man's apparent plan to set a Colorado Springs bank on fire wasn't exactly brilliant in the first place.\nAnd when it went wrong, it went really wrong, as you can see by the crazy video below.\nOn September 8, according to the Colorado Springs Police Department, firefighters from the city were called to a Wells Fargo bank at 5495 North Academy Boulevard because of what's described as a \"gas smell at the building.\"\nRelated Stories Jake and Kendra Warrum's True Love Dies With Sleazy Arson, Donation Scheme They soon discovered that a jar filled with \"suspected gasoline\" had been placed in the bank's overnight drop box.\nAt that point, security footage from outside the building was reviewed — and what footage it is.\nThe dude in question, who arrived at the bank on a bicycle, can be seen lighting the jar on fire as he places it in the drop box — and the giant flames that result nearly engulf him.\nThe video doesn't offer an especially clear view of the man's features, but there may be other clues to his identity. \"Based on the security video,\" the CSPD release notes, \"it appears as if the suspect may have received burns from the incident.\"\nIf you have any information about this case, you're encouraged to contact the police department at 719-444-7000 or Pikes Peak Area Crime Stoppers at 719-634-STOP (7867).
