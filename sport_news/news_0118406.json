A plucky career .288 batter turned fearsome slugger, piling up pelts of the sport's best pitchers on his mantle.\nThe Mets have waited years for this iteration of Murphy to evolve — well not quite this version, not even Murphy could have imagined this — from a swing-happy hitting junkie to one of the hottest hitters October has seen since Carlos Beltran pulverized baseballs for Houston 11 years ago. In seven games, he has already belted five home runs, with one in each of the last four games as the Mets have taken a 2-0 lead on the Cubs in the National League Championship Series .\nHis rise centers on temptation. For Murphy, it is temptation at the plate. For some two months now, he has finally evinced the discipline that has come and gone during seven years in the major leagues. For the Mets, it is the temptation whether to discard the resume he has built in a decade with the organization and focus on the present when Murphy hits free agency this offseason.\nPLUS : Despite crazy October, Mets still unlikely to re-sign Daniel Murphy, report says\nThe club has shown no inclination to offer Murphy a contract this winter and his historic run over the last 10 days has not changed its thinking, a person with knowledge of the teams plans said. The better question seems to be whether the Mets will make Murphy a qualifying offer next month.\nIf he accepts, the team will owe him $15.8 million in 2016, the reported value of the offer this year . If he declines -- as every player ever offered has -- the Mets can reap a supplemental first round draft pick if and when he signs somewhere else.\nThe teams that push for Murphy this offseason will also have to decide how much of what they've seen from him lately is a mirage and how much is real. It is not just these playoffs that are dissonant with Murphy's career, it is his final two months of the season as well. If Murphy has improved, at age 30, and become a more powerful hitter, he could be a newly redefined asset. If it is just a spell, then it's coming at the best possible time, glossing over his reputation as a poor defensive infielder and cunning, but chaotic, baserunner .\n\"I think he's finally got the message,\" one member of the organization said, yet that opinion is not unanimous.\nRELATED: History says Mets only lose NLCS with epic collapse Murphy has shied from a thorough explanation of his recent success but he points to an improved pitch selection as the cause. That has been a wavering trait over his career. His ability to make contact is an elite skill -- he led baseball this year by making contact with 97.5 percent of all pitches he swung at in the strike zone -- but he has not harnessed it. Too often, he has chased pitches outside, sending piddling fly balls into left field, even as he became an All-Star for the first time last season, rather than waiting for a more salivating option he could drive for extra bases -- grating, at times, with the Mets' hitting philosophy.\nIt his nature. Above all else, Murphy lives to hit . He talks about the mechanics of his craft with precision. He can not only ramble off the sequencing of his plate appearances but of his teammates too after watching them hawkishly from the dugout.\nWhen he flared a pitch from Jeurys Familia the opposite way during batting practice at Citi Field two weeks ago, he wailed with as much glee as he did two nights later when he crossed the plate after homering off Clayton Kershaw.\nSince then, he has hit home runs of Kershaw again, Zack Greinke, Jon Lester, and Jake Arrieta in consecutive games. Whoever wins the National League Cy Young award this season will have been branded by Murphy these past two weeks.\nHe has earned so much respect that Arrieta walked him intentionally Sunday night to face Yoenis Cespedes. Last month, Cespedes was the hottest hitter in the sport, swatting 17 home runs over 31 games for the Mets. Asked who is swinging better, him during that stretch or Murphy now, Cespedes took a deep breath and considered the question.\n\"I'm not sure,\" he said.\nIf Murphy's run is no fluke it will be because of the changes he has made at the plate this season. In April, after some prodding from Kevin Long and a putrid beginning to the season, Murphy relented to the hitting coach's advice and moved closer to the plate.\nLater in the season, he tweaked his approach. In each at-bat, he has minimized the part of the strike zone he is searching for a pitch to hit. And when he gets it, he says, he can turn his lower half and bomb away, as he did against Arrieta, cracking a curve ball into the second deck at Citi Field .\n\"I think it's just being more disciplined,\" Murphy said. \"Since we've been getting to a good hitting position a little earlier it's allowed me to see the ball earlier so hopefully wherever I'm looking, it allows me to take pitches that are outside that zone a little better.\"\nWhile Murphy made contact more often than all but one hitter in baseball this year and struck out less frequently than any peer, he has never posted an on-base percentage greater than .332 in any season he's made at least 500 plate appearances.\nProgress has been a process, even this year. Most days, he will step into the hitting cage at Citi Field and take batting practice with drill-specific baseballs, stamped with colored symbols. A black triangle. A red circle. Murphy calls out what he sees as the ball travels towards him and he readies to swing.\nNinety percent of the time, assistant hitting coach Pat Roessler says, he is correct.\n\"We were really trying to do damage to the ball,\" Long said. \"We started in spring training and at the end of the day sometimes it takes a little time.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/eye-on-baseball/25333950/qualifying-offer-set-at-158-million-which-free-agents-will-get-one", "https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&ved=0CCsQFjACahUKEwjctuvd9c7IAhVSOogKHc7NAtE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nj.com%2Fmets%2Findex.ssf%2F2015%2F10%2Fbehind_cunning_daniel_murphy_mets_win_nlds_for_rub.html&usg=AFQjCNFqahYVAbst4hOO-9jdKF7F_6jZrA&sig2=0jmV8oYG_MwRH7cvTDinsw"], "published": "2015-10-19T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:09:48.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
