No more cans. #BlueJays adjust beer policy for ALCS: Beer at 500 (highest) level of Rogers Centre will be poured into plastic cups and not sold in cans. — Ken Rosenthal (@Ken_Rosenthal) October 19, 2015 \nThis response was coming since the 18-minute delay last Wednesday night when all sorts of debris (but mostly beer cans) rained down on the field after plate umpire Dale Scott allowed a Texas baserunner to score from third after Jays catcher Russell Martin’s throw back to his pitcher hit the bat of the Texas hitter and went up the third base line. \nScott jumped out from behind the plate and seemed to signal time out as Rougned Odor came hustling down the line to the plate, but upon review the run was allowed. \nThe morning after MLB suggested measures would be taken to prevent a reoccurrence. \n“The highly unfortunate reactions of a group of fans at Rogers Centre in Wednesday's game represented a major source of concern,” MLB said in a statement Thursday. “We appreciate the response of the local authorities and the Blue Jays stadium operations staff in identifying, ejecting and - in some cases - arresting the offenders. \n“We will discuss comprehensive security plans for upcoming postseason games in Toronto and reiterate the importance of fans observing the appropriate code of conduct,” MLB said. “Setting yesterday's situation aside, the enthusiasm from Toronto fans in recent months has been extraordinary. We will do everything we can to foster a safe and fan-friendly atmosphere at Rogers Centre and to ensure that a situation like Wednesday's will not be repeated.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:04:49.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
