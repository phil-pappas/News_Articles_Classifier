(WYMT) -- On her transition from high school to college … \n“The biggest transition coming from high school to college has been the pace of the game because Kentucky is a lot faster, defensively and offensively. It is different from high school, but I also played AAU, which is a lot of Division I talent. The tempo and the pace are amazing. That is probably the biggest transition on the court, but off the court the biggest transition is keeping up with classes and basketball.” \nOn being from Kentucky and now getting to play for the Wildcats …“It’s been a great experience. Being from Kentucky it has always been a dream of mine to be Miss. Basketball, as well as being able to play at UK. I’m just blessed.” \nOn having a “pinch yourself” moment since starting at Kentucky … \n“I think I had that during Big Blue Madness when I was about to go on stage. When they were about to announce me my heart was beating so fast.” \nOn if she is surprised about Coach Mitchell’s demands defensively … \n“No I am not surprised at all because when he came to my house for a home visit he sat me down and told me what he was expecting. I knew this program well and I knew that defense was something they focus on.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:49:22.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
