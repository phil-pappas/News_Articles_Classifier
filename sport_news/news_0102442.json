Parking was hard to come by.\nFather Judge's 1-0 win did not disappoint. Just ask the large crowd the hard-fought battle attracted. \n\"It was spectacular,\" Judge senior Kevin Ceno said. \"The fans made it 10 times better than what it would have been. It was just a great atmosphere.\" \nCeno got the crowd going early, when he put the lone goal away in the seventh minute. He applied heavy pressure to the defense of Roman Catholic, forcing an error and sending the ball into the back of the net. \nThen it was up to the defensive tandem of McCarthy and Shane Holmes to make sure the Cahillites (13-1-2, 9-1-1) wouldn't equalize. The terrific senior duo did just that, and the Crusaders (16-0, 11-0) recorded their 12th shutout. \nFans for both teams easily filled the eight small bleachers at the facility. They also lined up from end line to end line - and then some - along the side of the field. In some sections, fans were standing four or five deep. \nMore lined up on an incline behind one goal, and some were even outside of the fence, their bodies pressed up against it, peering through the holes to watch. \nWith the conference playoffs starting Tuesday, the teams seem to think they are on another collision course. \n\"That's what I'm looking forward to, honestly,\" McCarthy said. \"I'd love a rematch in the championship.\" \nSounds like something the fans would like, too. \nRoman Catholic 0 0 - 0 \nHome 1 0 - 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:51:31.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
