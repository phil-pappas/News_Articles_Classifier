The former University of Virginia player is a management consultant for The Boston Consulting Group.\n\"It's the coolest feeling ever,\" Greenlief said. \"I think every golfer, especially every amateur golfer, really dreams of being a USGA champion, because it's really the pinnacle of amateur golf. To get my name etched on the trophy forever is something that I know will be a highlight of my golf career.\"\nOn the par-5 17th, Greenlief made a 35-foot birdie putt, and won the match when Shirley missed a 13-footer.\nThe 29-year-old Shirley, from Roswell, Georgia, was making her third straight appearance in the final. She lost to Julia Potter in 2013 at Biltmore Forest in North Carolina, then beat Potter last year at Harbour Trees in Indiana. The former Auburn player is the executive director of Atlanta Junior Golf.\n\"When you're 3 down after five, to try to battle back on a golf course like this when someone is not making any mistakes, it's hard,\" Shirley said. \"She's a phenomenal player, just a great champion, great girl and I had a lot of fun out there. It was a great match. That's all you can hope for.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:42:59.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
