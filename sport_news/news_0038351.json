Now, his decisions are becoming easier. The things we coached him on last year he can understand more and do because the game is slower.”\nUnderstanding applies to more than just on-court concepts. Caboclo came to the Raptors from Sao Paulo last year not knowing any English. Imagine coming into pro sports and dealing with the varying dialects and personalities that are on the court, in the stands and holding microphones and TV cameras.\n“It was so hard,” Caboclo said Friday of that first year, after coach Dwane Casey ran the team through an extra hour of practice.\n“This year, I know the plays and I’m stronger too. I have a better relationship with the team.”\nMahlalela said he doesn’t think people realize how difficult it was for Caboclo.\n“If you don’t understand what’s happening on the court there’s no way you can be successful,” Mahlalela said. “It was a huge testament to him, the amount (of English) he’s learned so far, but he needs to continue to learn.\n“To be a long-term NBA player, his English needs to get even better so he can understand coach’s instructions, so he can interact with the media. That language skill, that ability, is almost as important as what he does on the court.”\nOn the court, Caboclo is progressing. He hustled back after his turnover Monday night against the Minnesota Timberwolves and redeemed himself with a firm hand at the rim, sending a Karl-Anthony Towns dunk attempt back at him. The mention of the play brought a big smile to Caboclo’s face and it’s the kind of thing that will endear him to his teammates and to his coach.\n“Bruno has made huge strides since last year,” Casey said. “He’s playing with a tremendous amount of confidence and things don’t bother him as much as they used to. He’s right on pace as far as his growth. With his size . . . he can get a corner three off as well as anybody and he’s probably one of our best corner three-point shooters on the team.”\nBefore Caboclo can begin to truly earn a spot on Casey’s team, he’ll become a fixture this season on Toronto’s D-League team, the Raptors 905. When the Raptors secured the Mississauga-based franchise, Casey said he immediately thought of what it could do for Caboclo, who languished last year in two brief stints with the Fort Wayne Mad Ants. The Raptors shared that team with 12 other NBA clubs.\n“He needs those minutes,” Casey said. “Last year I think he got screwed a little bit in the fact that he only played three, four minutes (a game).\n“This year . . . as long as he can stand up he’s going to play. He’s a big part, all of those young guys it’ll be good for them to go around and play and get good minutes. It’s a huge, huge plus for our organization.”\nMore on thestar.com\nJoe Buck can’t win, with either Jays or Royals fans: Mudhar\nBreaking down home runs during first round of MLB playoffs", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:06:16.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
