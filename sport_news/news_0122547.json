According to a police report, Manziel was driving at a high rate of speed and passed cars on the shoulder before police were called. \nManziel was not arrested. \nThe Browns released a statement Friday saying they had spoken to Manziel about his behavior. However, the team did not exclude him from Sunday's game. \nThe incident raised concerns about Manziel, who spent 70 days in a rehab facility during the offseason for an unspecified condition. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:39:04.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
