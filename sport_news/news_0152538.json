The Bruins, long and widely considered a defense-above-all team despite what the statistics said, actually were a woeful offensive outfit in 2014-15. They missed the playoffs for the first time since 2007 largely because they scored too few goals. Major changes, from the front office to the roster (but not to the coaching staff) ensued. We start to see, beginning with Thursday night's 2015-16 opener against the Winnipeg Jets, if the on-ice changes work. First-year general manager Don Sweeney took what might be considered a curious path to boosting offense: Four of last year's top seven scorers — including Nos. 3 through 5 (Carl Soderberg, Milan Lucic, Dougie Hamilton) — were either traded or allowed to walk as free agents. Former Duck Matt Beleskey (free agent) and Boston-bred Jimmy Hayes (trade with Florida), the most recognizable forwards Sweeney acquired, wouldn't have reached seventh on the Bruins' scoring list last season. So how's this supposed to result in something more like 2013-14 (258 goals, No. 3 in the NHL) and less like '14-15 (209; 22nd)? • Coach Claude Julien enters his ninth season in Boston under directions from Sweeney to have the team play at a pace more in line with the speed-centered game employed by — well, pretty much every team in the Eastern Conference that finished ahead of the Bruins. • Beleskey and Hayes are not intended to be the centerpieces of an offensive revival, but hard-working, complementary pieces as the Bruins seek to, as Sweeney puts it, \"create more anxiety\" in opponents. • The Bruins expect a full year from David Krejci, the top offensive center who was injured most of last season, and are banking on strong second seasons from Ryan Spooner and David Pastrnak, rookies who were among their most productive players while so many veterans faded over last season's second half. High hopes and good intentions aside, the Bruins are preaching patience with the offense, for good reason: There's almost no carryover, not just from last year, but from the 2010-11 through '13-14 stretch in which the Bruins ranked among the NHL's top five in goals three times, and were legitimate Stanley Cup contenders. The combination of center Patrice Bergeron (team-high 52 points) and left wing Brad Marchand (tops with 24 goals) survives, with Loui Eriksson — the only other Bruin to hit 20 goals last year — skating at right wing. But elsewhere, three-time team scoring leader Krejci has to break in two new wings in Beleskey, who scored a career-high 22 goals last year in Anaheim, and 19-year-old Pastrnak, who led the Bruins last season with 26 second-half points. Nobody on the projected third line — Hayes (19 goals with Florida last year), Spooner (29 games) or Brett Connolly (5) — even played half of last year in Boston. And with Gregory Campbell and Daniel Paille now playing elsewhere, the fourth line — likely populated by veteran Chris Kelly, with newcomers like Zac Rinaldo (ex of Philadelphia), Joonas Kemppainen (free agent, via Finland) and others — will be virtually brand new. Similarly, the power play (only 17th in the NHL last year at 17.8 percent, down from No. 3 at 21.7 percent) must be overhauled, with regulars Hamilton, Lucic, Soderberg and Reilly Smith now playing elsewhere. Team president Cam Neely, whose handprints are on everything from the decision to fire GM Peter Chiarelli, elevate Sweeney, retain Julien and his staff, and alter the team's style of play, sees offensive potential. \"I feel our forward group is pretty deep,\" Neely said. \"I think we're going to get some more offense throughout all four lines … be more consistent in that regard.\" That will be critical, because with Hamilton traded to Calgary, it's difficult to see significantly more offense coming from the blue line. All defensemen will be encouraged to join rushes, but only Torey Krug (39 points last year) has anything like a history of production at the NHL level. The Bruins hope Colin Miller, who led AHL defensemen last year with 19 goals (10 on power plays) and ranked second with 52 points, is a Hamilton-in-the-making, but he hasn't played an NHL game yet. As center of the projected top-scoring line and a power-play quarterback, Krejci is key to hopes for offensive improvement — and he knows offensive improvement is essential. \"We know we have to be more creative offensively,\" he said. \"We know we have to stay consistent for the whole 82 games. \"It's not going to be easy, but we're going to have to, if we want to be in the playoffs again.\" By Mike Loftus Posted Oct. 5, 2015 at 6:57 PM » Comment or view comments [+] CDL TRUCK Driver Wanted: Dennison Lubricants in CDL TRUCK Driver Wanted: Dennison Lubricants in Worcester, Ma. is currently hiring for the position of a CDL truck driver, class A or B.
