The hosts did everything they could. They didn't even give up in mandatory overs. Their fast bowlers ran in hard, tried different lengths; switched ends during their different spells; spinners bowled extended spells with a lot of variations but all they could manage were six Odisha wickets in a day.\nThe wicket slowed down considerably and didn't behave in a manner as Vidarbha would have hoped for, which was unusual for a last day wicket. Off-spinner Akshay Wakhare (4-84 & 5-77)—who became fastest to take 100 wickets breaking his mentor Preetam Gandhe's record—was the shining light for Vidarbha on a dull track. He bowled tirelessly from one end and did bulk of the bowling to pick up his ninth five-wicket haul but his efforts were nullified by the lifeless track.\nFollowing on, Odisha were trailing by 193 but played out 97 overs on the last day scoring 230-6 in their second innings. In fact, two of their first three wickets were gifted by the batsmen. Openers Girija Rout (29) and Natraj Behera (24) were hardly troubled in the first hour, although they got most of their runs in the third-man region early on. Rout wasted his second start of the match slashing Ravi Thakur's delivery that was too close to cut against the run of play. Govind Poddar hardly played any false shot in the first innings during his 148-run knock on Saturday. However, when he came in to bat, he thought he was batting on the same score. Coming down the wicket, he unnecessarily lofted the ball at deep mid wicket when the fielder was already placed exactly for the lofted shot.\nVidarbha smell blood when well-set Behera caught at slip by Wasim Jaffer off Wakhare's brilliant delivery. However, Anurag Sarangi (92, 178b, 12x4) showed his love for such tight situation. The southpaw had scored a crucial 83 in their last year's relegation match against Saurashtra on a challenging wicket. The Jamtha wicket didn't pose that much threat but still he needed to be resolute. The 22-year-old showed a lot of responsibility as his 88-run fourth wicket stand with skipper Biplab Samantray (34, 113b, 3x4) almost sealed the fate of the match. Samantray was cleaned up by Wakhare with a classic off-spinner's dismissal. The delivery pitched outside off and uprooted his middle stump. Young Pratik Das (39, 101b, 4x4) didn't do anything silly and batted with patience to take Odisha to safety.\nThe late wickets of Sarangi—who missed a well-deserved hundred—and keeper Rajesh Dhupar gave Vidarbha a glimmer of hope and they even tried hard in mandatory overs. However, even skipper Subramaniam Badrinath knew he was chasing improbable. After seven mandatory overs, both captains agreed for a draw.\nSCOREBOARD\nVidarbha (1st Innings): 467.\nOdisha (1st Innings) 274.\nOdisha (2nd Innings, following on, Overnight 15-0): G Rout c Sharma b Thakur 29, N Behera c Jaffer b Wakhare 24, G Podder c Shrivastava b Wakhare 4, A Sarangi lbw b Wakhare 92, B Samantray b Wakhare 34, P Das Not Out 39, R Dhupar c&b Wakhare 1, D Behera Not Out 1.\nExtras: (lb 6) 6.\nTotal (6 wickets, 105 overs) 230.\nFall of wickets: 1-54, 2-59, 3-65, 4-153, 5-222, 6-226.\nBowling: R Thakur 15-0-17-1, U Yadav 14-4-35-0, R Jangid 25-8-61-0, A Wakhare 37-13-77-5, S Wagh 10-4-24-0, S Badrinath 4-0-10-0.
