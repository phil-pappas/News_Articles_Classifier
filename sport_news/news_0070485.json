Union hockey looks to get back to winning ways 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Schenectady\nMike Vecchione acknowleged there were off-season rumors that he'd be leaving the Union College hockey team and moving up to the professional ranks.\nThe rumors turned out to be just that, proven by the fact that the junior from Saugus, Mass., was front and center Friday at Union's media day, with his jersey adorned with the \"C\" signifying his appointment as a co-captain for the Dutchmen.\nUnion kicks off the 2015-16 season with a seven-game homestand, with the opener next Friday at Messa Rink against Sacred Heart.\nVecchione figures to be leading the way following a sophomore season that featured 19 goals and a team-leading 31 assists in 39 games from his center position.\n\"There was no thoughts of me leaving, I know there were a lot of rumors going around,\" Vecchione said. \"My intentions here are to finish out this year and we'll talk about it after that. We've got a great team, I have a lot of confidence in these guys right now. I'm just excited to get this season going.\"\nVecchione was named co-captain along with senior winger Matt Wilkins , who was voted as Union's Most Improved Player last year with 13 goals and 28 points in 34 games.\nThe choices for captains and the alternates were made by head coach Rick Bennett and his staff.\n\"As far as Matt, being a senior and having three years and the way he came back, he has really matured in his time here,\" Union coach Rick Bennett said. \"As far as Mike is concerned, I think he is a 'watch me work' type of guy and that is what he's shown, plus the proof is in the pudding as far as his stats are concerned.\"\nThroughout his Union career, Wilkins has displayed the willingness to bring a physical brand of play to the ice and in the corners.\n\"That has a little bit to do with it (the captaincy), I try to play the game the right way,\" Wilkins said. \"We want to be a hard-hitting and gritty team. That is what Union hockey is all about.\"\nComing off its first national championship season last year, Union opened the season with five straight wins before struggling to maintain its consistency. The team finished 10th in the 12-team ECAC before bowing out in the second round of the league tournament.\nUnion missed the NCAA Tournament for the first time in four seasons and will be looking to get back to its winning ways.\n\"We are hungry and we want to get there (the NCAA Tournament) again,\" Wilkins said. \"I think we can take the next steps to get there. We have the target off our backs and I think we are back to being underdogs. We need to earn teams' respect.\"\nJunior defenseman Jeff Taylor , a native of Clifton Park, was named alternate captain along with sophomore forward Ryan Scarfo .\n\"It feels good, hopefully I can lead by example,\" Taylor said.\n\"It is a huge honor and I'm very grateful for the opportunity,\" Scarfo said. \"Coach made his decision on hard work and what he saw and he believes in us. I'm looking forward to the challenge.\"\nSean Martin , a local freelance writer, is a frequent contributor to the Times Union .", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/25/8729966/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/25/8729966/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/25/8729963/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/25/8729965/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/25/8729963/3/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/25/8729964/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/25/8729965/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/25/8729964/3/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/25/8729966/3/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/25/8729965/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/25/8729962/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/25/8729962/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/25/8729963/3/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/25/8729962/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/25/8729964/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-03T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:03:00.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
