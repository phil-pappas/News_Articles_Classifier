John Collins / Baker City Herald Baker High School students Caistyn Brooks, right, and Tucker Foersterling remove the wood-plank siding from one of the buildings Monday. BTI Students Tear Down Buildings On Contaminated Property The weathered, wooden buildings that have occupied the east Baker City lot at 2430 Balm St. for more than 90 years have come down this week as part of an educational effort to clean up the contaminated site. The work began Friday when two students from the Baker Technical Institute at Baker High School used pry bars and hammers to begin ripping nails and boards from two of the buildings. They worked alongside and under the guidance of their teacher, Megan Alameda, and volunteer Mike Aguirre. Alameda is the instructor for the class titled “Environmental Science: Brownfield in Baker.” Aguirre, owner of My Little Woodshop in Baker City, has helped train the students and lead them in the first phase of the tear-down work in exchange for the usable salvaged weathered wood. Aguirre said he will use some of the weathered redwood, cedar and fir boards from the old buildings to make rustic home decor products at his shop at the north end of Main Street. Alameda recruited Aguirre after learning about his demolition experience when the class called for statements of qualifications for review before hiring a firm in March to lead the cleanup effort. In advance of their trip to the site Friday, the two adults trained students on safety rules designed to prevent injury. Both young men who joined the project Friday said they were eager to participate in the effort. “It’s a good class,” said Caistyn Brooks, as he worked to tear the sturdy old boards away from the framing of a storage shed. “I like helping the environment.” Tucker Foersterling, another member of this year’s 14-student class, agreed. “It sounded fun and I had nothing going on today,” Forersterling said of his decision to join Friday’s work party. Recruiting help on a Friday is difficult, Alameda said. Other students were called away with sports and other activities on their day off from classes. During their training, the students learned about the proper protective equipment needed to keep them safe. The two 14-year-olds who worked on the project Friday donned hard hats, face masks and eye protection. “Masks and eye protection are key,” Aguirre said. “There is 100 years worth of dust and grime accumulated on these boards.” The boys also used lessons from Aguirre’s longtime experience as a firefighter, “look up, look down and look around,” before swinging boards or moving into the path of a swinging board. And they came wearing boots and long-sleeved shirts for the job. Aguirre, who is a finish carpenter by trade, was fascinated by the soundness of the buildings, which he attributed to the high quality lumber cut from the old-growth trees that were routinely harvested in the 1920s. And the solid framing used to put the buildings together. “These are amazing structures,” he said. “They’ve lasted the test of time.” Aguirre also pointed out the old newspapers stuffed between the framework and the sawdust used to insulate the building before the exterior boards were nailed on. “We found old newspaper that says weird stuff on it,” Brooks said. For example, Aguirre said, one of the vintage 1927 newspapers advertised silk stockings for 3 cents. Aguirre and Alameda hope to preserve some of the artifacts found at the site and in the old buildings. They will offer them to the Baker County Historical Society and the Baker Heritage Museum. “We’re looking at what we could do as a gesture for Walter and Ava (Ostwald, who donated the property to the school district),” Alameda said.
