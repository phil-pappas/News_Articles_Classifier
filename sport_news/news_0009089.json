Roland was (seen) in the heat of the moment at the race weekend,” Whincup said. \n“The best thing to happen was someone letting me give my side of the story. \n“I thought the team made a mistake by bringing us both in on the same lap (to pit) – I was just trying to avoid an (pitlane) issue. \n“Five seconds later I realised I made the wrong call. \n“But I was prepared to get behind the safety car and couldn’t believe my eyes when I got the green light from the car sitting on the right indicating for me to go through. \n“It was like a ‘get out of jail free’ card. Of course I was going to take it but the stewards deemed I shouldn’t have done that.” \nSix-time V8 series champion Whincup is 803 points behind championship leader Mark Winterbottom of Ford. \nWhincup conceded he was still in title contention to defend his V8 crown but would assess his hopes after the final enduro round at the Gold Coast. \n“I won’t think about that until after this weekend,” Whincup said. \n“We are still in contention but there is no point in commenting on it. \n“I think any comment would be (portrayed) as a negative comment. \n“We will assess it after this weekend and work out our run home.” \nPractice for the Gold Coast 600 begins on Friday.
