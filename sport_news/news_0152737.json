Wayne Hills must contain Ramapo senior QB Keith Woetzel (six TD passes, 229 rushing yards, five rushing TDs) if the Patriots are to bounce back from their first loss of the season, a 23-20 defeat at No. 2 Pascack Valley. \nThe pick: Wayne Hills\nNo. 4 Paramus Catholic (1-3)at No. 2 Don Bosco (3-1), 7\nStory line: The loaded Paladins expected to return to the Non-Public Group 4 championship game this season, yet find themselves fighting for one of eight spots in their bracket.

Sophomore Johnny Langan, playing in his hometown of Wayne tonight, and junior Patrick Holly are expected to see time at quarterback after Tennessee-bound senior QB Jarrett Guarantano suffered what is likely a season-ending foot injury. DePaul has not won a Big North United game since beating the Crusaders on Oct. 11, 2013 (0-6 since).\nThe pick: Bergen Catholic\nNo. 5 Mahwah (4-0) at Ramsey (3-1), 7\nStory line: This is one of North Jersey's best rivalry games, and this season it carries some serious North 1, Group 2 playoff implications. The Rams have won three straight to establish themselves as a contender, but they will have their hands full trying to stop a James Ciliento-led offense that has averaged 45 points.\nThe pick: Mahwah\nNo. 13 Boonton (4-0) at North Warren (4-0), 7\nStory line: Boonton's players are confident a week after ending a nine-game losing streak against perennial Morris County power Mountain Lakes that began in 2006. Boonton, led by versatile senior QB/S Gage Cabalar (532 rushing yards, eight TDs) and senior LB David Koval (team-leading 47 tackles), has scored 38 points or more in three of its four games. North Warren has allowed just 6.3 points per game and shut out two of its opponents.\nThe pick: Boonton\nBecton (3-1) at No. 14 Cresskill (3-1), 7", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:15:03.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
