He also has 40 carries for 281 yards and one touchdown.\nHe said it: \"Really just the receivers got open. Once they got downfield they read the safeties and made the right reads and I got them the ball.\"\nCoach said it: \"A year ago today, he was down there with the freshman. It's a whole different ballgame when you move up to the varsity level. He's making that adjustment ... That's a big jump, you look out there, you see a 6-2, 205 body, or however tall he is, he walks to the sideline takes his helmet off, he's just a young guy. You forget that sometimes.\" - Mark Behrens\nDid you know? Jalen is the brother of former Sachse receiver/cornerback James Mayden and current Sachse senior cornerback Jared Mayden.
