The record stood until this season when Dutch 17-year-old Max Verstappen made his first appearance for the same team. \nThe Spaniard left Formula One at the end of the 2011 season and most recently competed in the Formula E electric series. \nAfter fainting following a race in Moscow in June, he withdrew from the final races in London on health grounds. \n\"I could continue competing but I'm stopping,\" said Alguersuari who has long spent his spare time working as a DJ and composing music, adding that he had no concerns about his health. \n\"I could stay just for the money but I need a change. What makes me happy is music, I am going to make music.\" (Reporting by Alan Baldwin in London, editing by Tony Jimenez) Trending On Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T14:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:46:06.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
