(Photo: Michael Shroyer-USA TODAY Sports) 1 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS , W.Va. – Most people arriving at the luxury resort The Greenbrier do so with smiles and great anticipation. \nBut this is a business trip for the Cardinals, who are practicing here this week between games at Detroit and Pittsburgh. \nThey accomplished the first order of business Sunday, beating the Lions 42-17 , but the victory came with a price. \nOutside linebacker Alex Okafor is expected to miss significant time with a calf injury. \nThe Cardinals are hopeful Okafor will miss no more than a month, according to an NFL source. \nBackup linebacker Kenny Demens , a core special teams player suffered a torn ACL and is out for the season. Safety Chris Clemons , also an integral special teamer, suffered a hamstring injury. \nOn special teams, “it’s going to be really hard to replace those two guys,” coach Bruce Arians said. \nThe team is awaiting MRI results for Okafor and Clemons. \nArians wasn’t grim when he met with reporters on Monday afternoon, but he seemed subdued. Perhaps it was the trip from Phoenix to Detroit to here. And the injuries likely had something to do with it, too. \nRELATED: NFL standings | NFL scoreboard | NFL stats \nThe Cardinals don’t practice until Wednesday, but Arians raved about the facilities at the Greenbrier, where the Saints have held training camp the past two summers. \n“It was a lot easier traveling last night than going all the way back to Phoenix,” Arians said. “We knew coming in here that it was going to be an outstanding facility, that we could get our work done and it wouldn’t be any kind of distraction.” \nArians said he hadn’t been in this area of West Virginia since he drove here 35 years ago. \n“We actually were going to go snow skiing for the first time ever and it rained,” he said. “We drove back to Blacksburg (Virginia).” \nIt was Arians’ first year as a graduate assistant at Virginia Tech. Despite the rain, his group had a good time on the trip. \n“Oh, yes, I promise you,” he said. \nGame balls \nArians awarded game balls to receiver Larry Fitzgerald , running back Chris Johnson and safeties Rashad Johnson , Deone Bucannon and Tony Jefferson . “I thought they played outstanding, especially Tony,” Arians said. “He was really striking people well. He had a really good game stopping the run and he has been doing it for a while.” \nJefferson and Bucannon each finished with 11 tackles. Jefferson also forced two fumbles. \nGAME PHOTOS: CARDINALS AT LIONS Oct 11, 2015: Arizona Cardinals head coach Bruce Arians (L) talks to Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford (9) after the game at Ford Field.
