Houston trails West leader Texas by two games with two to play. \nKeuchel (20-8) gave up two runs on six hits in six innings, becoming the Astros' first 20-game winner since Roy Oswalt went 20-12 in 2005. \nThe AL wild-card game is scheduled for Tuesday, and the Yankees have already clinched a spot. If Keuchel pitched, it would mark the first time he's worked on three days' rest. \nCarlos Correa hit a solo homer and bases-loaded triple. George Springer, Colby Rasmus and Luis Valbuena homered as Houston surpassed its previous high of 19 runs set twice, most recently against Pittsburgh in 1999. \nRuby De La Rosa (14-9) lasted three innings.
