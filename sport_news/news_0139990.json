Kankakee thoroughly dominated Pontiac last year. The Kays were looking to get into the playoffs and needed the win to do so. They got it with a 66-20 thumping of the Indians. But Kankakee did not make the postseason. It had 40 playoff points but it wasn’t enough with a 5-4 record. Some of the big weapons have left, but there are some players who had success returning. “Kankakee is very athletic,” PTHS head coach Buck Casson said Wednesday afternoon. The Kays will enter this game with a 3-5 record and play a 5A-6A schedule. The weaponry includes top running back DeAndre Caldwell and quarterback Kelvontae Bell. Caldwell rushed for 116 yards on five carries last year. This included a 75-yard touchdown dash. Kankakee’s athleticism is a concern for the Indians. “We try to scheme and take away what they like to do. I don’t see a clear, most dangerous man for Kankakee,” Casson said. “I see several guys who very capable. It will be more sound, solid defense. Everybody has to do their role.” A weakness might be discipline. How disciplined are the Kays? For Pontiac’s sake, it is hoped the Indians are more so than the opponent. This will help on defense in stopping Kankakee’s attack. And it will help on offense as the Indians try to keep the ball out of the visitors’ hands. Casson said he is looking for consistent play from his charges. “I feel our defense has improved each week and I think our offense has thrown some new looks and wrinkles and been able to expand some of the playbook,” Casson said. “We have to sustain drives. They flow to the ball and we’re going to have to have to take a (second-and-long) and turn it into a third-and-manageable down will be very key for us.” Pontiac’s offense revolves around a solid rushing attack with Vaughn Hobart and Levi Ransom. Hobart had 64 yards last week and Ransom has been hobbled. They have a combined 1,510 yards on the season. Seth Cunningham threw for 119 yards last week in leading the Tribe past U-High. A reason for the low yardage total was in the defense — not U-High’s but Pontiac’s. The Indians have been playing a bend-but-don’t-break defense most of the season. The time of possession stat has also been misleading with the Indians. The PTHS defense has been on the field more often than the offense. There are other aspects to this game than just defeating Kankakee. Pontiac has made the playoffs and will be looking to possibly host a first-round game. Page 2 of 2 - “You always have to prepare ahead. You’re focused on one team and one week at a time,” Casson said. “But as far as practice goes, we’re always mixing things in that we want to do down the road.” It is possible at 7-2 to get a home game and the opponent will most likely be another 7-2 team or one sitting at 6-3, depending on the bracketing. Pontiac missed the playoffs last year after going 3-6 but advanced in 2013 after finishing the regular season at 5-4 and faced Peotone in the first round of the Class 4A playoffs. Peotone was a 7-2 team. The challenge for Pontiac is to come out of the Kankakee game ready for the playoffs. “We need to come out healthy and feel we improved,” Casson said. Kickoff is set for 7:30 p.m. with Senior Night ceremonies taking place between the freshman and varsity contests.
