Ohio State is the only team in the top 16 to have the same ranking this week as last.\nMeanwhile, No. 2 TCU and No. 3 Baylor edged forward, No. 4 Michigan State slipped and No. 5 Utah and No. 6 Clemson took big jumps.\nAfter four teams in the top 10 lost Saturday, the rankings were rattled and five teams received first-place votes. The Buckeyes received 38 first-place votes — their fewest this season after beginning as the first unanimous preseason No. 1. TCU has five first-place votes, Baylor received 10, Utah has seven and No. 9 Texas A&M has one.\nThe No. 1 Buckeyes held off Indiana, 34-27, Saturday and now have been top-ranked 101 times — matching Oklahoma for the most in the 79-year history of the media poll.\nHowever, Ohio State is 101st in the country in turnover margin at minus-4 after three giveaways and no takeaways Saturday. No other ranked team has a turnover margin that bad.\n\"We were just killing ourselves with turnovers and everything,\" running back Ezekiel Elliott told reporters after the game at Bloomington, Ind. \"We’ve got to eliminate that.\"\nTurnovers cost Irish \nCLEMSON, S.C. — Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly understands too well dramatic rallies that fall short are simply losses.\nHe watched that unfold Saturday night as the Irish got off to a slow start, then turned the ball over four times in the second half in a 24-22 loss at then-No. 12 Clemson.\nThen ranked sixth, the Irish (4-1) gave up two touchdowns in the first seven minutes and fell behind, 21-3, right after halftime. Yet quarterback DeShone Kizer gave them a chance to win before he was stopped on a two-point conversion run with seven seconds left, putting an end to Notre Dame’s perfect start and, perhaps, its run at the College Football Playoffs.\n\"We’re too far along for moral victories,\" said Kelly, who is in his sixth season.\nIn the end, Kelly said it was Clemson’s two far-too-easy touchdowns in the first seven minutes along with the turnovers that cost the Irish in this one.\n\"If they take care of the football and start fast, they are going to win the football game,\" Kelly said.\nBriefs \nMichigan State coach Mark Dantonio said senior safety RJ Williamson had surgery Sunday to repair a torn bicep suffered in Saturday’s win over Purdue. Williamson may be able to return for the last game of the regular season, Dantonio said, and should be back for sure for the postseason.\nGeorgia coach Mark Richt said he’s sticking with Greyson Lambert as the Bulldogs’ starting quarterback. Lambert completed just 10 of 24 passes for 86 yards in a 38-10 loss to Alabama.\nTexas cornerback Kris Boyd apologized Sunday for being on Twitter during halftime of an embarrassing 50-7 loss to No. 3 TCU, at which time he passed along a suggestion that he’d transfer to Texas A&M.\nLate Saturday \nNo. 18 STANFORD 55, ARIZONA 17 (at Stanford, Calif.) — Christian McCaffrey ran for 156 yards and a touchdown, Remound Wright scored three times and Stanford overwhelmed Arizona.\nKevin Hogan threw for 217 yards and two touchdowns to help the Cardinal (4-1, 3-0 Pac-12) win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:45:38.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
