Norm Gough Support your local coach To the Editor: Mass shootings by young males has reached a tipping point creating a momentum that is beyond horrifying. But guns are no more responsible for killing people than spoons are for making people fat. Dr. Sax M.D. and Ph.D. who wrote, “Boys Adrift,” says it this way, “The problem is that we have forgotten that boys do not just become men, they are mentored into manhood. Boys must go through a conscience process, the importance of initiation rites were known by the Navajo, the African warrior Masai tribe and the Orthodox Jews. Otherwise they remain caught in a self-protective attitude that becomes violence against the weak. A mentoring process by a strong male serves to equip them to deal with the difficulties of life and to redirect their energies towards the good of the community.” The good news is that something can be done about this problem that does not require one new piece of legislation. The answer is to support male mentors. How? If you are a manager, let your male employees off early to coach. Support your local teachers, mechanics, painters and accountants, encourage him to head up a male youth group. Perhaps you have noticed a neighborhood with a young man that looks like he needs someone to take him hiking or fishing, get past your fears and take him. If you have a son, don’t buy or encourage violent video games. And if he has videogames, limit his exposure to them. And finally get him to church and make him realize that there is something greater than himself that he needs to answer to. People create healthy societies, these are all ways a civilized world creates healthy men and civilized society. It’s up to us and not the government. Suzanne Cruz Keep momentum going To the Editor: To get change we just need to understand these facts. U.S. Military killed in war from 1776 to 2015 — 656,397; gun related deaths from 1989 to 2014 — 836,290. (Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) The cost in dollars is abhorrent as well. Gunshot wounds and deaths cost Americans at least $12 billion a year. Justice Scalia acknowledged that “gun ownership is not without restrictions.” Ergo, gun ownership is not a right — it is a privilege. You do have a right to defend yourself and property; even Scalia said that — District of Columbia vs. Heller. However, the individual states have the right to place restrictions on guns and gun ownership.” 220 million Americans say they do not own a gun. With an estimated 300 million guns in the U.S., that means a minority is hoarding the guns. We can restrict the number of guns purchased to one a month like we now do in California. We can require that all guns be registered and insured just like our cars. We can restrict the size of magazines (now law in eight states and DC) and the type of weapons, (now law in seven states and DC). And thank you Gov. Brown for signing SB707 — making our schools gun-free. (The gun crazies will sue of course.) Much can be done to cut the number of deaths. One statistic shows that assault weapons and/or large-capacity magazines led to a 135 percent increase in people shot and a 57 percent increase in deaths. So let’s keep the momentum going — we could save tens of thousands of lives and billions of dollars — and the best part is we do not violate a single right of any American. WOW! That is so cool.
