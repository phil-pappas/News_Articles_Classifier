Yet the talkie missed a larger point. The “call” was not bad for baseball’s business. It was terrific.\nAs baseball fades as a national television attraction, the Division Series are not exactly must-see TV (Quick: Who is playing in this season’s ALDS?). Outside of participating teams’ fans, and hardcore seamheads who bunker in on a sunny day in August to watch a game, no one else is rushing to tune in.\nEven in the postseason, the game is predictable and slow. Casual fans needed to juice ratings disappear. They have better things to do, like watch ESPN’s “Monday Night Football.”\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE\nBut now a window has opened — briefly — to snag these casual fans. When Utley broke Tejada’s leg, an element of violence was incorporated into the Dodgers-Mets NLDS series. When it comes to sports, violence sells. And if the media can prime the pump, speculating and encouraging the prospect of more mayhem, all the better.\nAlready, TBS’ Dodgers-Mets ratings are trending upward. Game 2 attracted an average of 4.2 million viewers, making it the most viewed DS game in that Saturday night window since 2010.\nGame 1 scored a 2.6 rating nationally and a 10.5 (an NFL-like rating) in the New York market. And in the seventh inning (when Utley did his thing) and the eighth (when the TBS crew was still discussing it) the national rating went up.\nIn the run-up to Monday night’s Game 3 at Citi Field, the Valley of the Stupid, and other media precincts, were preoccupied with two subjects — retaliation and retribution. Should the Mets seek revenge for losing their shortstop? How should they exact it? Or should they stay cool and turn the other cheek?\nNot so surprisingly a self-proclaimed man of peace, Mike (Sports Pope) Francesa was preaching an eye for an eye, or something like that. Get this: The Pope is actually upset the Mets did not take care of dirty business Saturday night.\n“I’m shocked the Mets didn’t retaliate when it was 5-2,” His Not-So-Holiness said. “They should’ve plunked someone right there. Then the benches would have emptied and everything would have been settled.”\nA premature ending to this fiasco would have been terrible for baseball. It would have eliminated two days of VOS Gasbags, and other columnists, commentators, and headline writers enticing eyeballs to watch G3 by promoting the possibility of another violent incident.\nAnd to think all this publicity is free.\nAnd great for MLB’s business.\nHARVEY DANGER\nIt’s no revelation that Matt Harvey has already ticked off a large segment of the media, most of whom once acted like they discovered him. This animus runs so deep it is hard to determine who is being put on trial by the media, Utley or Harvey? Typical was Joe Benigno’s Monday comments, which (what a shock) had a pessimistic quality. “I don’t want to hear any of this Dark Knight and super model stuff,” Benigno said on WFAN. “He better go out and stick it to the Dodgers. This isn’t about Chase Utley.”\nThis must mean Harvey, with a Citi stumble, could replace Utley as Public Enemy No. 1 in the VOS.\nINTENTS PLAYER\nWhether it’s in the booth or studio, no analyst is getting paid for being a mind reader. Yet it’s strange analysts like Ron Darling or Keith Hernandez, or Cal Ripken or Pedro Martinez, felt comfortable saying Utley had “no intent” to hurt Tejada. They, nor anyone else for that matter, know what his intent was.\nAnd it was hard finding anyone who would say Utley delivered the hit with bad intentions.\nFor all the hand wringing, Utley came out of this episode unscathed. If anything, his reputation as a hard-nosed player whose “hustle” can change the momentum of a game was enhanced.\nEverywhere except Queens.\nMIKE THE HOMER\nAlways consider the source.\nOn his local Sunday NFL show, Francesa characterized SNY’s Hernandez, Nelson Figueroa and Jim Duquette as “homers” because they all said Utley should have been called out for interference, which would have led to an automatic double play for the Mets.\nThe pontiff made it seem the three analysts were the only voices on earth who expressed this opinion. Still, when it comes to knowing about being a “homer,” Francesa is an expert.\nHe’s carried James (Guitar Jimmy) Dolan’s water for over a decade. The Pope was asleep through Isiah Thomas’ reign of error. And his latest contribution to Dolan’s PR machine was saying Derek Fisher missing practice to be with his new squeeze in Los Angeles, which triggered embarrassing headlines and commentary, is no big deal.\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 3 NEXT SLIDE > The Chase Utley controversy gets some more eyeballs on the NLDS. - Corey Sipkin/New York Daily News © Provided by New York Daily News\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.nydailynews.com/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfoVsz.img&quot;}}", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Mets", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfnGy4.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyxle.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Will", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;baseball_mlb&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfoem2.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BBkkQsl&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Chase", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfoaMf.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Will"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:52:34.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
