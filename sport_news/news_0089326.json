It's the worst in 10 years,\" Halem Jemarican, head of the Environment Office in Songkhla province, told AFP by phone.\n\"The key factor is the wind. It's strong at the hot spot origins but when it reaches Thailand the winds weaken so the haze stays around for longer,\" he added.\nTransport officials said two Bangkok to Koh Samui flights had to return to base Thursday while a Singapore flight to the resort island diverted to Phuket. A flight to Songkhla's Hat Yai airport was also diverted on Wednesday evening.\nSouthern Thailand boasts many pristine tropical beaches and is an especially popular tourism destination.\nEarlier this month several planes packed with beach-bound tourists to Phuket and Koh Samui were forced to turn back because of haze levels.\nThailand's Public Health Ministry said it had distributed 55,700 facemasks in the south with a further 40,000 were on the way.\nIn a statement the country's Pollution Control Department said it had \"called for Indonesia to implement measures to reduce burning in order to mitigate haze\".\nLand is illegally cleared by burning in Indonesian tropical peatlands, which are rich in carbon but are being drained and cleared at a rapid rate to make way for agriculture, particularly fast-expanding palm oil plantations.\nWhile the loudest complaints have come from leaders in relatively affluent Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, it is poor Indonesian villagers who are suffering most.\nPictures this week revealed a thick, yellow haze smothering Palangkaraya in central Indonesia, with locals forced to go about their daily life regardless of the extreme health hazards.\nExperts warn the current outbreak of pollution is on track to become the worst ever, exacerbated by bone-dry conditions caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon.\nIndonesia earlier this month agreed to accept international help after failing for weeks to douse the fires and last week launched its biggest fire-fighting push yet, with dozens of planes backing up thousands of personnel on the ground.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:45:25.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
