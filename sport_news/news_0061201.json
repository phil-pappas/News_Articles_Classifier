Texas A&M advanced to the second round of the 2015 NIT, along the way capturing 21 victories to hit the 20-win plateau for the eighth time in 11 seasons. \nHouse, a 6-foot-7 guard, emerged as one of the SEC’s most explosive and consistent scorers last year during his first season at Texas A&M. The Fresno, Texas, native garnered first team All-SEC honors after ranking fourth among all league players in scoring during league games at 16.2 points per game. \nFor the entire season, House led the Aggies and ranked ninth in the SEC by scoring 14.8 points per contest while shooting 41.7 percent from the floor and 40.0 percent from 3-point range. He scored 20 or more points in seven games last year, including three outings with 25 or more points. \nCaruso, a three-year letterwinner from College Station, enjoyed another impressive season as a junior in 2014-15 and earned honorable mention All-SEC accolades from the Associated Press . Caruso started all 33 games for the Aggies, averaging 31.5 minutes per contest and increasing his scoring average for the second straight season, finishing with a 9.1 point-per-game pace for the season inducing a 10.1 scoring average during league play. \nThe 6-foot-5 guard dished out 182 assists for an average of 5.5 per contest becoming the first player to pace the SEC in assists for two consecutive seasons Nick Calathes of Florida in 2008 and 2009. He also led the SEC in steals with 69 (2.1 per contest). \nHouse along with Florida’s Dorrian Finney-Smith, Kentucky’s Tyler Ulis and Vanderbilt’s Damian Jones also received votes in the Player of the Year voting. Jones, Simmons and Ulis joined House on the All-SEC First Team along with Kentucky’s Skal Labissiere and Ole Miss’s Stefan Moody. \nThe 2015-16 campaign begins November 13, when the Aggies host USC-Upstate at Reed Arena with conference play set to begin January 2.
