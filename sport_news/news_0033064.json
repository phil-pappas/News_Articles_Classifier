Friday night, the Pioneers tried to stay unbeaten as they entertained Loudon.Pioneers have their popcorn ready. Hoping to put on a show against the Redskins. Sadly, for Traneil Moore, all he could do was eat popcorn. He sat out after hurting his knee last week. Pioneers offense didn't miss a beat on their opening possession. Dump pass to Dominique Millener, he's got some running room. He picks up a 1st down at the 29 yard line. Pioneers then go with the ground attack. Lorenzo Stewart rumbles for big yardage to the 5. Pioneers give it to Stewart again. He pushes in for the touchdown to make it 7 - 0. Redskins try some razzle dazzle. Flea Flicker to the Quarterback, but Millener sniffs it out for the East Ridge defense. East Ridge goes on to win 27 - 8. They remain unbeaten at 9 - 0.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:36:00.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
