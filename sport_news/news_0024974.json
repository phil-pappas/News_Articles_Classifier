In nearly every state, it’s illegal for bartenders to serve booze to drunken patrons.\nIf they do and that drunk then gets behind the wheel and ends up killing or injuring someone, the server and/or the bar owner can be charged criminally and held responsible for damages civily.\nThat is, of course, the civil thing to do. After all, one third of all traffic fatalities in the United States (12,000 a year) are caused by impaired drivers.\nBut parents who give their kids “long guns” — rifles or shotguns? They’re good to go.\nAnd if those kids are deranged sociopaths or on psychiatric drugs — which can lead to homicidal tendencies — but have never been involuntarily committed or been formally determined by a court to be mentally ill? Still good to go.\nKids can even possess “handguns if a parent has provided consent and the state law allows it,” according to Lindsay Nichols at Smartgunlaws.org.\nFIND OUT HOW MUCH MONEY THE GUN LOBBY GIVES TO YOUR LOCAL OFFICIAL\nPlenty of harm, no federal foul.\nhandout A photo of Adam Lanza as a young boy. He had been around guns all his life, even though his parents knew he was mentally disturbed. On Friday, yet another killer who doesn’t deserve to have his name in print, shot and killed a fellow student, Colin Brough at Northern Arizona University, and injured several others. Another weekend, another school shooting.\nWhen does it end? When do we get the guns out of the hands of mentally unhinged youth? Maybe when their parents step up and take responsibility.\nMyspace Christopher Harper-Mercer's mother had the family move to Oregon in order \"to open carry.\" For example, both mentally disturbed Adam Lanza (the Sandy Hook deranged mass murderer), and Christopher Harper-Mercer, Oregon’s cowardly psychopathic school shooter, were disturbed loners living with gun-loving mothers; mothers who kept arsenals at home while their sons were growing up, encouraged gun use by those sons even knowing they were mentally disturbed and obsessed with guns and violence.\nNew York Daily News/New York Daily News Parents like Laurel Harper, who allowed her son to be around guns despite being mentally unstable, should be charged with crimes as well, Linda Stasi says. The medicated Lanza was so deranged that he communicated only with his mother who lived in the same house via email and stayed inside playing violent video games like “School Shooter.” The Oregonian reported “There are a number of indications that Harper-Mercer had mental health or behavioral issues. His screen name on some social media sites was ‘lithium love.’ Lithium is used as a psychiatric medication,” and has been linked to risks for violent and homicidal behavior.\nStill Harper-Mercer’s mother, Laurel Harper, a practical nurse yet, had posted that she moved them from California to Oregon “to open carry.”\nCCHR International recently reported that “35 school shootings and/or school associated acts of violence (which includes guns, knives, and swords) with 169 wounded and 79 killed have been committed by students and others taking or withdrawing from psychiatric drugs.”\nLanza, who had been on such meds, was so deranged that he dwelt in the basement, communicated only with his mother who lived in the same house via email, kept black plastic garbage bags over his windows, and stayed inside playing violent video games like “School Shooter.”\nBottom line: Parents who buy guns and encourage gun use by their mentally ill kids, especially those who are on psychiatric drugs, should be charged as accessories to murder.\nOf course, Nancy Lanza can’t be charged with anything. Her deranged son shot her to death, and then went out to kill little children.\nD.C. IS SO FULL OF ‘HACKS\nTalk about a glass House!\nSen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, is going bonkers because hackers in China, South Korea and Germany may have attempted to penetrate Hillary Clinton’s personal email server for three months — after she left office.\nMeantime, during that same time, Chinese cyberattackers were reading U.S. government emails and last December stole the personal information and security-clearance files of 22 million federal employees, contractors, their family and friends.\nHANDOUT/MCT Kevin McCarthy was a t one time favored to be named the new Speaker of the House, but recently withdrew.

On Thursday, married House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) dropped out of the speaker’s race after Wikipedia entries for both McCarthy and married Rep.

The poster used an email address from Johnson’s own beloved Homeland Security!\nMaybe Hillary had the only secure server after all — well, until the FBI got involved, at any rate.\nISIS TOO EVIL EVEN FOR VLAD\nMaking the world safe for dictators everywhere!\nVlad (the Impaler) Putin first managed to give refuge to and “save the life” of Ukrainian’s ousted dictator Viktor Yanukovych (before taking over the brute’s country). Then he claimed that the well-equipped, unidentified invading troops with tanks and billions in equipment weren’t Russian.\nNow Putin is bombing the hell out of U.S.-supported Syrian rebels against brutal President Bashar al-Assad, claiming this time that Russians are only bombing ISIS.\nAlexei Druzhinin/ASSOCIATED PRESS Vladimir Putin is trying to claim that his country is only bombing ISIS, but a report shows that the terrorist group is making very large strides in northwestern Syria — right where Russia has been bombing.

Warning: Phubbing and FOMO can lead to depression, sexual disinterest and relationship woes.\nA survey by Baylor University of 450 adults shows that phubbing — “being snubbed by a partner constantly checking a smartphone” — can lead to all of the above. And when combined with FOMO (fear of missing out), the result is positively prehistoric.\nOne shrink, Anita Sanz, told Quora.com that it harkens back to the time when a caveman “missing out on something could mean the difference between life and death.”\nConclusion?
