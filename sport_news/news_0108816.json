The victory improved Verona's record to 6-0 on the 2015 season. \nThe Hillbillies have not lost a game since the 2013 season, but head coach Lou Racioppe doesn't believe there is any added pressure to perform well on the field. \n\"We just want to go out and play our best game every weekend,\" Racioppe said. \"It starts with a good week of practice and then we always want to be ready to play. You only get to play so many games and we don't want to let any get away from us.\" \nVerona played a typical Hillbilly game and won the battle of the trenches on both sides of the ball to secure the victory. Senior running back Mark Riggio recorded the first of his two touchdowns to open the scoring for Verona. He pounded through the Shabazz defense to pick up the 20-yard score. \nThe Hillbillies scored their second touchdown through the air when junior quarterback Zack Zaccone hit senior tight end David Gautieri for a 17-yard touchdown in the second quarter. Verona's lead increased to 21-0 when Riggio ran for a 12-yard touchdown. \nShabazz responded with a 37-yard touchdown pass to bring the score to 21-7, but the Hillbillies responded with a long drive that culminated with Zaccone's goal line touchdown run. Zaccone's run increased Verona's lead to 28-7 heading into halftime. \nVerona relied on its strong rushing attack in the first half, as evidenced by the three first rushing scores before the third quarter. While Riggio and Zaccone did a good job running the ball, Racioppe said credit goes to the big guys in the trenches. \n\"They both ran hard and made some great cuts but their success was all because of the blocking by our linemen, our full back and our stalk blockers,\" Racioppe said. \"No matter how good you are with out the blocks it is very difficult to be successful.\" \nThe Hillbillies continued to play well in the second half and added two more touchdowns, both in the third quarter. Zaccone hit sophomore CJ Lavery for a 49-yard touchdown pass early in the quarter and found Gautieri again in the end zone from 18 yards out to close the scoring for Verona. \nZaccone's two second half touchdowns gave him a total of four against Shabazz. Racioppe had nothing but praise to offer his starting quarterback. \n\"He was outstanding. He made several audibles, ran hard and threw the ball exactly where it needed to be,\" Racioppe said. \"He is progressing nicely.\" \nShabazz added two more points with a safety, but it was not enough for the Bulldogs as the Hillbillies hung on for the 42-16 victory. Racioppe credited his defense for their strong play. \n\"Our defense played well again,\" he said. \"Coach Roshong put a nice plan together and our players executed it well. Shabazz had some weapons that we contained for most of the game.\" \nThe win sets the stage for Verona to increase its winning streak to 18 Oct. 23 when the Hillbillies travel to Millburn for a Friday night showdown with the Millers. Racioppe said his team will be ready in a game that could have playoff implications. \n\"Millburn has a highly touted running back who we must contain,\" he said. \"They are also a Group 4 school with several wins, so this is a huge game for us in terms of power points. It is a game that we will be ready for.\" \nEmail: gewelb@northjersey.com Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:07:23.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
