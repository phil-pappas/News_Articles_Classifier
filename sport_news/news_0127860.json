(AP) — The Detroit Lions are losing linebacker DeAndre Levy soon after getting him back. \nLions coach Jim Caldwell says Levy needs hip surgery after having a setback. Levy aggravated the injury Sunday against Arizona in his first game of the season. Caldwell says the team has not yet decided to put Levy on injured reserve. \nThe winless Lions will likely start linebacker Josh Bynes on Sunday at home against Chicago. \nDetroit drafted Levy in 2009 in the third round and signed him to a four-year extension last summer. He has been one of the franchise’s top players, earning second-team, all-league honors last season. He ranked second in the NFL with six interceptions in 2013 and has picked off 13 passes in his career. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:53:09.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
