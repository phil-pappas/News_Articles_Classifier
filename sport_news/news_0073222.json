Only Minnesota center Karl-Anthony Towns (75) ranks higher among rookies. \nUnfortunately, after Noel and Okafor the Sixers' dropoff is extreme: Robert Covington is next at 202. \nGuard Nik Stauskas, acquired in a trade with Sacramento, is next at 241 followed by point guard Isaiah Canaan (243), who was acquired from Houston, and free-agent point guard Kendall Marshall (262). \nAfter Okafor - Noel was actually selected sixth overall by New Orleans in 2013 before being traded to the Sixers - the highest-ranked player on the roster whom the Sixers actually drafted is forward Jerami Grant at 287. \nThe Sixers have just two players rated in the top half of all 400 NBA players â€“ the fewest among all teams. The Brooklyn Nets and New York Knicks are next with four Top 200 players. \nClearly, if 2014 pick Joel Embiid (third overall) was not going to miss a second straight season with a foot injury and forward Dario Saric was in Philadelphia instead of Europe, the Sixers' roster would rank higher. \nStill, considering the number of draft picks, the possibility of trades and free-agent signings, the fact that the Sixers have just two players ranked in the Top 200 is troublesome. \nThe Sixers have five players under contract who are ranked below 300, including forward Carl Landry (318th), the highest-paid among them at $6.5 million, and Furkan Aldemir (377th), who makes $2.83 million. \nPerhaps it is simply the result of Hinkie again purposely assembling the worst roster possible to maximize the odds of getting high picks in the 2016 draft. \nOf more concern is that it is a sign he might not be as great a talent evaluator as his resume indicates. \nObviously, Hinkie gets credit for the Noel trade. It is almost as if he drafted Noel himself. The same can be said of Saric, which was essentially a swap of lottery picks with Orlando in 2014. \nStill, of the 16 picks Hinkie has made, Okafor, Grant, Richaun Holmes, Pierre Jackson and J.P. Tokoto are the only ones who might be on the Opening Night roster. \nOne starter and maybe two rotation players out of 16 picks is around the Mendoza Line for success. \nAmong many needs, the Sixers' most glaring need is for an NBA-quality point guard. Canaan is the highest-ranked player who is a point guard. \nHinkie drafted point guard Michael Carter-Williams with 11th pick in 2013 and then traded him after he won Rookie of the Year. \nCarter-Williams is ranked at 103rd. The Sixers have a conditional pick that could be as high as fourth in 2016 for him. \nThat might end up benefiting the Sixers, depending on who they draft. But will that player be better than Milwaukee forward Giannis Antetokounmpo (40th ranked) or Utah center Rudy Gobert (42nd), picked after Carter-Williams? \nOrlando point guard Elfrid Payton, whom the Sixers drafted 10th and then traded for Saric, is the 97th-ranked player. \nUltimately, Saric might end up being the better player once he comes over. But right now, there is no denying that the progression of Noel and Okafor would be helped by having a young point like Payton, who is already considered a Top 100 player. \nNoel, Okafor, Payton or Carter-Williams would be a tangible core to build around, instead of projecting whom the Sixers might get in the 2016 draft before the 2015-16 season has started. \nWith the future picks Hinkie has in hand, this could all change next season. If, however, the current roster is an indication of the Sixers' talent-evaluating skills, having those picks might not mean much.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:40:38.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
