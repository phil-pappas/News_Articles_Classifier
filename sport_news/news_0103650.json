We’ve let too many miles pass under our feet. Come in, come in: this table’s for you, the one with the hot dogs covered in everything we’ve grown in our garden the last five years and the pizza you like that’s chewier than Wrigley’s gum. Can we pour you an Old Style?\nIt’s been 19 years since we collided with each other, us and you, you and us, Chicago and New York, Fun City and Second City. Nineteen years! There was a time when it seemed spring hadn’t officially sprung until the Bulls and the Knicks ran into each other in April, sometimes May, sometimes June.\nMan, those were good times. Well, especially for you: the Bulls ransacked the Knicks in 1991 on their way to winning their first title. They gritted their way through an epic seven-game series a year later — you remember, right? Xavier McDaniel almost made Scottie Pippen cry in that one. And in 1993 … well, Charles Smith returned the favor, made an entire city cry in the most critical moment of that one.\nPatrick Ewing, not one for sentiment or cheap emotion, was chatting before a game at Madison Square Garden a year or two ago and he said this: “I don’t dream about basketball very often. But when I do, it’s always us against the Bulls. Every single time.”\nWe finally got you in 1994; you’ll excuse us if we minimize one looming absence (that was Michael Jordan’s lone full year away from the NBA while he chased his baseball dreams) and one critical presence (Hue Hollins, the referee who so graciously put Hubert Davis at the foul line at the very end of Game 5 of those Eastern Conference semifinals; despite where he presently works, Phil Jackson will tell you Pippen STILL has yet to even graze Davis).\nAllan Houston shoots over Michael Jordan in 1998.

And there was one last encounter, in 1996, but the Bulls were in another stratosphere by then and it felt like a championship unto itself when the Knicks took one paltry game off them. And there was this: on the night when that series ended — May 14, 1996, Bulls 94, Knicks 81 — Dwight Gooden pitched a no-hitter for the Yankees against Seattle in The Bronx.\nIt was a symbolic passing of the torch in two ways: the Yankees, in essence, took over ownership of the town that night from the Knicks. And that was the last moment when New York and Chicago felt like the rival sporting cities they were supposed to be. Our attention (and obsessions) drifted to Boston. Yours went … where? Green Bay? Cleveland?\nIsn’t this better?\nIt’s good that it is baseball that brings us all together, because it was baseball that brought us all together in the first place. Remember? Well, no, of course you don’t: none of us was alive in 1908. Only a handful of our grandfathers were alive in 1908. But that’s when it began, this long staredown between Broadway and Broad Shoulders.\nHow long ago was that? Put it this way: the Cubs were the defending World Series champions in 1908. Baseball was king in New York, but it was the Giants who ruled with an iron fist; the Dodgers were drowning, losing 101 games that year. The Highlanders of the American League were even worse, losing 103.\nAnd the Giants were locked in an epic three-game race with the Cubs and the Pirates that should, for all intents and purposes, have been decided on the afternoon of Sept. 23. That day, at the Polo Grounds, New York’s Al Bridwell delivered a single with men on the corners and two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning that should have given the Giants a 2-1 win.\nBut as fans descended onto the field and joyous Giants departed and angry Cubs stewed, Chicago’s second baseman Johnny Evers noticed that Fred Merkle, the runner on first, hadn’t actually made it to second before turning back for the clubhouse. Evers called for the ball. A Giants coach, wise to what Evers was doing, grabbed it and threw it away. Evers grabbed another one. He stepped on second.\nThe umpire, Hank O’Day, called Evers out, declared the game a tie. When the teams ended the season tied, they had to replay the game. And when the Cubs won the replay 4-2 on the way to a second straight World Series title (which, you may have heard, is also the Cubs’ last World Series title), Fred Merkle’s gaffe earned a forever place in the lexicon of sports: “Merkle’s Boner.”\nIt would take 61 years for New York to even the baseball scorecard.\nWe’ll get to that in a bit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:18:46.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
