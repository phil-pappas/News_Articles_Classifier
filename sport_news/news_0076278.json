It didn’t rate as another Music City Miracle, but coach Rex Ryan like what he saw in the end.\n“Quarterback’s got the biggest heart,” Ryan said of Taylor. “Man, it was tough sledding, but he’s got guts, he’s got heart. He wasn’t playing great, but at the end of the day he’s the reason we won the game.”\nRyan added that teammates rallied behind the quarterback who won a three-man competition for the job.\n“He’s running for touchdowns, getting back up and throwing deep balls,” linebacker Preston Brown said. “He played outstanding for us today. You want to go out and fight for a guy like that.”\nTaylor ran for 76 yards as the 3-2 Bills snapped a five-game skid against Tennessee.\nStephon Gilmore intercepted Marcus Mariota’s pass with 1:32 left to seal the win.\nThe Titans (1-3) blew their second straight double-digit lead at home and have lost back-to-back games by a combined three points.\n“We’ve got to get over that hump,” Titans coach Ken Whisenhunt said. “We’re close, but we’re not quite there.”\nThe Bills played without receiver Sammy Watkins (calf) and running back LeSean McCoy (hamstring) for a second straight week, with McCoy’s replacement Karlos Williams also out recovering from a concussion. They lost running back Cierre Wood in the second quarter with a knee injury.\nLate in the third quarter, Taylor started running and brought the Bills back.\n“We found a way to win, so struggle or not we found a way to win with the guys that we knew we were going to play with,” Taylor said.\nMore on thestar.com\nArgos not fooled by Alouettes poor record\nDavid Price could pitch out of Blue Jays’ bullpen if needed tonight", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:52:34.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
