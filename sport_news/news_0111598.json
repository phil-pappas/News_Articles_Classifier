We are here with our family and friends. \n“We appreciate everyone respecting our privacy at this time. We ask for your continued prayers.” \nKris Jenner, along with Kim and Kourtney Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, have flown back to LA for prior commitments (Kim, for one, has an important appointment with a pregnancy specialist), but are set to return at the weekend. \nCopyright [gotpap/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images] \nKhloe, meanwhile, is refusing to leave Lamar’s side, with Kendall due to fly out to Las Vegas to be with her. \nThe family have suspended activity on their apps during this time, releasing a statement which reads: “As a family we’ve decided to hold off on publishing content across our apps while we continue to support and pray for Lamar. \n“Thank you for your kindness and understanding during this difficult time.” \nCopyright [Instagram/Kylie Jenner] \nKylie Jenner has followed her momager and Rob Kardashian by sharing a photo of herself and Lamar on Instagram, writing: “Let’s dance again together soon. Prayers up for Lamar please.” \nKourtney then posted a lovely photo of Lamar with her son Mason, captioning it: “Believing in the power of prayer for this beautiful soul.” \nCopyright [Instagram/Kourtney Kardashian] \nA source added to ET that the family are ‘devastated’, revealing: “They have tried so hard to help Lamar with his issues and it breaks their hearts that he could lose this battle. \n“The entire family is pulling for Lamar to make it through this.” Reblog", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T12:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:09:06.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
