(AP Photo/Craig Ruttle, File) NEW YORK (AP) â€” A former teammate of a professional basketball player arrested outside a New York City nightclub says his friend was giving money to a homeless man when he was taken to the ground by police officers. \nEx-Atlanta Hawks power forward Pero Antic testified Tuesday in the Manhattan trial of Thabo Sefolosha (sehf-ah-LOH'-shuh). \nAntic says he was also taken to the ground and handcuffed by police after he touched an officer on the shoulder and asked why his friend was being arrested. \nSefolosha has pleaded not guilty to misdemeanor obstructing government administration, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest charges stemming from the April 8 confrontation with police. Charges against Antic have been dropped. \nProsecutors say Sefolosha disobeyed orders when officers tried to clear the area following a stabbing. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
