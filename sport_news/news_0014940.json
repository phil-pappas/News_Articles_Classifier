His work ethic in practices is impressive, so good for him. This was a huge win for him and us.\" \nNeuvirth became the second goalie in Flyers history to register shutouts in his first two starts with them - Jeff Hackett did it in 2003 - and the fifth in NHL history to accomplish the feat with any team. \nThe much-maligned penalty kill, which was 27th in the NHL last season, has done its part after a poor start. \nThe PK was successful on just 6 of 10 in the first two games, losses to Tampa Bay and Florida. Rookie coach Dave Hakstol downplayed the penalty killers' efficiency in those games, saying it came down to \"a save, a bounce of the puck, an inch here or there that creates a turnover and the puck goes down the ice.\" \nIn the last two games, both shutouts, the penalty kill was flawless. \n\"We've been doing a pretty unbelievable job,\" said Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, who led the forwards with 4 minutes, 38 seconds of penalty-killing time against Chicago. \"It felt like all the units were together [Wednesday]. It was four guys [working] together.\" \nChicago had three third-period power plays, including a five-on-three for 23 seconds. \n\"You try to go out there and don't give them the easy shot,\" Bellemare said. \nWhen Chicago did have a point-blank chance, Neuvirth stood tall. \n\"You know you have the wall behind you,\" Bellemare said of the 6-foot, 209-pound goaltender. \"Neuvy's making the saves we need to have him make.\" \nBreakaways. Backup goalie Jason LaBarbera was sent back to the Phantoms. . . . The Flyers are off until Tuesday, when they host Dallas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:35:42.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
