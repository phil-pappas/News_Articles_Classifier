I bet if you studied all of Division I college football, he hangs in there as good or better than anybody.”\nLicata beat the blitz handily in a losing effort last week against Bowling Green and could be challenged again Saturday when UB visits Central Michigan.\nCentral Michigan blitzes about 35 percent of the time, which is above average but not a reckless amount. However, the Chippewas blitzed Licata relentlessly in beating UB last year. Whether Licata will get enough time to throw will be a big factor in the key Mid-American Conference game.\nBeating the blitz – rushes of five or more men – usually is a strength of Licata’s. So far this year, he’s 23 of 39 against the blitz for 290 yards, four touchdowns, no interceptions and no sacks, according to News statistics. Last year at least a third of his 29 TD passes were against the blitz.\nThe senior from Williamsville South knows where the voided areas of the defense are, and he often waits until the last second to attack them.\n“He probably takes some hits you wish he wouldn’t sometimes,” says UB coach Lance Leipold, offering a view that no doubt is shared by Licata’s mother.\n“I invite the blitz,” Licata says. “I like to deal with blitzes because it’s one on one on the outside.”\nOne of Licata’s heroes is former NFL great Kurt Warner. Like Warner, Licata is a stationary, pocket passer. He’s not beating the blitz by buying time scrambling around the backfield.\n“I remember watching a show on Kurt Warner, and he was talking about beating the blitz and standing in until the last possible second,” Licata said. “I just read his book, too, and he talks a lot about that. He mastered it, and I’ve learned a lot from watching him.”\nLast week’s 28-22 loss to Bowling Green was the most blitzing UB’s offense has seen this season. Licata was 13 of 21 vs. the blitz for 155 yards, one TD and no interceptions.\nKotelnicki says that Licata does a good job understanding when to go immediately to his hot read and when to try to go for a bigger play downfield. A defense can blitz an offense into submission if it forces the QB to dink and dunk to the check-down receiver all game.\n“It’s about balance,” Kotelnicki said. “You don’t want to do one or the other all the time. You don’t want the only answer to be get the ball out quick with a three-step drop, because then secondary players will cheat down.”\nLast year’s 20-14 loss to Central Michigan was an exception to Licata’s blitz-beating trend. Licata was just 6 of 16 against the blitz for 32 yards, with two sacks and an interception. It didn’t help that UB’s run game was shut down. The Chippewas got UB into a lot of third-and-terrible situations and attacked more than usual.\n“They don’t bring as much pressure on film right now as they did in that game, but every game plan is different,” Licata said. “We’ll be ready for anything.”\nCentral Michigan had the No. 1-rated defense in the MAC last year. The matchup for UB’s offensive line is a concern again this year. The Chippewas have four returning starters on the defensive line.\n“They’re big up front,” Kotelnicki said. “They’re a physical defense. They are who they are, regardless of whether they’re playing Michigan State or Monmouth. They’re doing the same stuff. That’s admirable.”\nemail: mgaughan@buffnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:44:13.546+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
