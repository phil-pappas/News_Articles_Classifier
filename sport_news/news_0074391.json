He plays that way every night.\"\nPrice was the difference on a night the Leafs carried the play for long stretches and had a 37-30 shots edge. Alex Galchenyuk scored the winner in the third period.\n\"We obviously would've liked to maintain a little bit more offensive-zone pressure,\" Price said. \"But at the end of the day it worked for us, and we'll definitely take the win.\"\nBabcock left the Detroit Red Wings after last season to coach the Maple Leafs. He spent 10 seasons in Detroit, leading the Red Wings to the 2008 Stanley Cup title.\n\"There's no moral victories in the NHL,\" Babcock said. \"You either won or you lost. It's real simple that way. But obviously the process is there, and they're trying.\"\nJames van Riemsdyk had a power-play goal for Toronto early in the second period.\n\"He won the MVP last year for a reason so he's a tough one to score on,\" van Riemsdyk said about Price. \"But we've got to stick with that process, and we'll have some success.\"\nBernier finished with 27 saves.\n\"I thought their goaltender was real solid,\" Babcock said. \"I thought ours was real solid after the first shot.\"\nBabcock made the first coach's challenge in NHL history and was successful in overturning a goal.\nBabcock challenged Jeff Petry's apparent goal in the second period, arguing that Tomas Plekanec interfered with Bernier. Referees Frederik L'Ecuyer and Dan O'Rourke looked at the replay by the penalty box at Air Canada Centre and determined Plekanec made incidental contact with Bernier.\nMontreal defenseman P.K. Subban appeared to suffer a left leg in the third when he was boarded by Leo Komarov. Subban stretched his leg on the bench, tested it several times during stoppages and stayed in the game.\nNOTES: Defenseman Matt Hunwick, signed to a one-year contract July 1, was one of the alternate captains for the Maple Leafs, along with Tyler Bozak. ...
