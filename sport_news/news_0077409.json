Just three weeks after reaching his maiden Super Series final at Korea Open, Jayaram continued his rampaging run as he defeated 12th seed and world No. 48 Raul 21-12 21-18 in a 34-minute lopsided match. In the opening game, world No. 26 Jayaram opened up a 4-0 lead early on and didn’t allow Must to come anywhere near him as he extended the lead. Must, who had ended the run of another Indian, RMV Gurusaidutt, in the quarterfinals, showed signs of recovery in the second game when he took a 6-5 lead. But the Indian quickly clawed back, surged ahead, and then slammed the door on Must to clinch a deserving win. Jayaram had won the Dutch Open last year too. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:16:26.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
