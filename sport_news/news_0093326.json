First a flash from the cannon vent hole, a split second later, boom! \nA column of fire as long as 40 feet long explodes from the cannon muzzle, followed by a lingering plume of white gray smoke. And the crowd goes wild. \nIf you have ever attended a home Rutgers football game at High Point Solutions Stadium you've certainly heard the cannon blast from the corner of the north end zone. No projectile of course, but a loud scoring celebration — Rutgers style. Cannon group celebrates Rutgers football score with a boom Jack Nelson portrays Henry Rutgers, a colonel in General Washington's artillery and early benefactor and namesake of Rutgers University. Nelson leads a group of revolutionary war reenactors who fire a blank charge from a cannon in the end zone following every Rutgers score at High Point Solutions Stadium in Piscataway. (Video by Andre Malok | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com) \nIt was in 1976 when Jack Nelson joined a group of Revolutionary War re-enactors, the Second Regiment, Middlesex County Militia. It was a few years later when the group took over the four-pounder cannon originally operated by the university's R.O.T.C. after it stopped working. \n\"We made the cannon work,\" Nelson, 66, said. \"We test fired it, and the athletic director who was walking by broke into a very large smile and gave us the thumbs up.\" \nNelson and his artillery group has been making it go boom! ever since. \nNelson, who portrays Henry Rutgers, a colonel in Gen. Washington's artillery and early benefactor and namesake of Rutgers University, says the cannon is fired several times at each home game. \n\"When the band comes out to play the song \" Colonel Rutgers \" and when the team comes out,\" Nelson said. \"We fire at half time and end of game.\" \nOf course they also blast the cannon after touchdowns, extra points, field goals and safeties. ALSO: Kyle Flood expects a raucous Ohio State crowd \n\"Through the very lean years, he was the guy who was here, bringing it,\" Matt Black, a member of Nelson's artillery group, said. \"Through rain, through snow, through sleet. He's the go to guy. No fair weather fan by any means.\" \nThe group prepares around a dozen blank charges of black powder wrapped in aluminum foil before the game begins. But they carry material to make more if the team puts more points on the board and additional celebration is needed. Jack Nelson has been a revolutionary war reenactor who has fired a cannon at Rutgers home games for more than 35 years. Andre Malok | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com \nSafety is the number one concern for this artillery group. \n\"Everybody you see now on the field has had experience,\" Nelson said. \nThe cannon area is roped off to keep people from accidentally walking in front of the blast area. From time to time, a distracted photographer or visiting team mascot might make the mistake of walking out in from of the gun. Nelson and his crew are quick to react when people walk into the line of fire. They make sure to raise their awareness of the dangers of a nearby cannon blast. \n\"In all the time we've been shooting, nobody has been hurt,\" said Nelson, who lives in Howell Township. \nSo after more than 35 years of celebratory cannon blasts for Nelson, the question is: How much longer will \"Colonel Rutgers\" grace the end zone at Rutgers football games? \n\"Until I am no longer safe,\" he said. \"When I decide I can't do it any more, I'm going to turn it over to somebody else.\" \nJudging Nelson's track record and passion for game day, that could be a long time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:10:15.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
