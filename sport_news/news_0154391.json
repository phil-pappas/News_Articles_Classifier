He knows he's got to keep training well every day and if he keeps doing that and performing as he did tonight I'm sure he'll get an opportunity. \n\"He is a very calm and level-headed boy. I don't see any chance of him getting carried away and I have a feeling his club manager won't let him do that and we'll be the same. That will be a consistent message. Goals are something he has to add to his game if he is going to be in the number 10 role. \n\"He's a very powerful player. His use of the ball and ability to ride challenges and manipulate the ball quickly is very special. He should be very pleased with what he's done and hopefully he can progress that over the next few weeks with his club.\" \nGoals from Norwich's Nathan Redmond and debutant Chuba Akpom, on loan at Hull from Arsenal, confirmed England's dominance in the second half as they started their Euro 2017 qualifying campaign with two wins from two in Group Nine. \nSouthgate said: \"This is a tougher qualifying group than last time, we know Norway and Switzerland and very strong. It was important not to slip up and we now have two important games next month which can really shape the group.\" \nSouthgate also eased fears over Liverpool's Joe Gomez after the defender was forced off with a knee injury in the second half. \n\"It seems to be okay, we were a bit concerned at first but we are hopeful it's nothing too serious,\" he added.
