(Charlie Neibergall / Associated Press) Chris Dufresne Contact Reporter \nUSC's next football coach is out there somewhere. He might be getting his team ready this week for a big game, or a small game, or applying pancake makeup for his role as a television analyst. He could be unemployed, playing golf and cashing termination checks from an NFL team that thought he was the answer. USC will pay gobs of money to a search firm that will identify and vet candidates. It is not Rankman's job to save a rich private school millions of dollars on the kind of headhunters who rubber-stamped Steve Sarkisian's past. Yet, there's a decent chance the next Trojans coach is also a punch line in this week's top 25. \n1.

Michigan State 7-0; Coach Dantonio's icy stares might scare USC fans who tie sweaters around their necks. (8) \n9. Michigan 5-2; If only Coach Harbaugh had played for Ted Tollner in college instead of Bo Schembechler. (11) \n10. Notre Dame 6-1; Good chance Coach Kelly would come west; more likely as coach of the L.A. Rams. (9) (Gary Klein) \n11. Stanford 5-1; Coach Shaw stole USC's 1970s power offense and is running it in Palo Alto. (12) \n12. Florida 6-1; Too late now but Jim McElwain was coaching at Colorado State when USC hired Sarkisian.

Coach Stoops, 55, probably has one more big move left. (NR) \n23. Utah State 4-2; Coach Wells just thumped Boise, but there's a chance no one at USC has heard of him. (NR) \n24. Pittsburgh 5-1; USC should test Coach Narduzzi's moral dilemma: could he leave Pitt after one year? (NR) \n25. Oregon 4-3; Coach Helfrich way too \"Coos Bay,\" but has Chip Kelly's cellphone number.
