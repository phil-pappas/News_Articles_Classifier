The Ministry has revised the pay structure of the team doctors, mental trainers, physiotherapists, masseurs, nutritionists and physiologists associated with 16 sports disciplines in which India will compete at the Rio Games. The Ministry has sent the file to the Finance Ministry for the final approval. The team doctors and mental trainers stand to benefit the most with a two-fold hike in their salary. While the doctors will receive Rs 1 lakh, increased from their salary of Rs 50,000, the mental trainers’ salaries will be increased from Rs 40,000 to Rs 75,000. The Ministry’s decision has come at a time when the majority of sports federations are struggling to engage quality experts to help the athletes prepare for Rio. The reason being the meager amount paid to these experts. Earlier this year, when the National Rifle Association of India had tried to hire a foreign trainer, the appointment could not take place due to the high salary demanded by the expert. Similarly, India hockey team coach Roelant Oltmans is still waiting for the appointment of his additional support staff as the salary demanded by some of the experts is not acceptable to the Sports Authority of India (SAI). But, by increasing the salaries, the Ministry has tried to address the genuine concern of the sports federations. The salary hike will not only help in retaining the support staff, but also fill up the vacant posts in various sports disciplines. Revised pay structure\nTeam doctor: Rs 1,00,000 (earlier 50,000) Mental trainer: Rs 75,000 (earlier 40,000) Physiotherapist: Rs 60,000 (earlier 40,000) Masseur: Rs 40,000 (earlier 20,000) Nutritionist: Rs 50,000 (earlier 30,000) Physiotherapist: Rs 60,000 (earlier 40,000).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:57:07.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
