After a bogey at the par-3 7th hole, she put even more distance between herself and her closest pursuers with a chip-in eagle at 13 and birdies at 14 and 18. \nKo's win on Sunday not only propelled her to number 1 in the world in the Rolex Rankings — a spot occupied by South Korea's Inbee Park since June 15 — it also made her the youngest player ever on the LPGA Tour to capture 10 wins on the tour. Park was unable to compete in Taiwan because of a previous sponsor's commitment. \n\"To have won my first professional event as a professional here in Taiwan, and my 10th LPGA win here, it's pretty cool and it's an exciting time,\" Ko said at a press conference after the tournament. \n\"Last year has been the most amazing rookie year for me ... it was so much better than what I could have imagined,\" Ko said. \n\"After such a great year, you kind of don't know what you're coming into the year after, but this year has been so awesome. So many great memories, so many things I've learned along that journey,\" she said. \nWhile the 18-year-old Kiwi was cruising to victory on Sunday, most of the Taiwanese players were winding up forgettable tournaments. The best finish was turned in by LPGA Tour regular Hsu Wei-ling (徐薇淩), whose eagle on the final hole of the tournament left her with a four-day total of 1-over 289 to tie for 29th. \nCandie Kung (龔怡萍) had the second best finish among Taiwanese players, tying for 34th with a four-round score of 2-over 290. \nTsai Pei-ying (蔡佩穎), who divides her time between Japan and Taiwan, was in a tie for 10th after a 3-under front nine put her at 3-under for the tournament. But a difficult back nine that saw mistakes off the tee turn into two double bogeys and two bogeys left her at 3-over 291. \nShe finished tying for 37th place with local favorite Yani Tseng (曾雅妮) and another Taiwanese player Hsieh Yu-ling (謝瑀玲). \n\"I can't say I'm satisfied with the way I played. I did well for the first three days and the first half of today, but I messed it up on the back nine today. I made a lot of little mistakes off the tee and took penalties on 12 and17 that really hurt,\" said Tsai, who would have finished in a tie for 10th had she played the back nine at even par. \nNot surprisingly, she may also have had a case of the nerves. \n\"I really felt pressure on the back nine, especially after I fell back down to even par because I really wanted to finish under par,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:48:57.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
