Jeff Dalley's football team moves from second into a tie with Aberdeen for first place going into the final week of the season.Sports Line's power-rankings formula measures a team's total performance using win-loss record, point differential and strength of schedule. In 2014, the top five teams in SL's rankings all played their way into their respective state championship games. Three of those teams; Highland, Snake River and West Side, ultimately won their titles. Blackfoot and Aberdeen were the only two inside the top five to lose in the final weekend. Related Content Power Rankings Week 8 2015 \nEntering Week 9 of the high school season, teams from 5A all the way through 2A are fighting for the final few spots left at their respective state tournaments. Highland has already won the 5A district, leaving Madison, Skyline and Hillcrest vying for the final two bids to the postseason in that conference. Madison travels to Hillcrest Friday night, and the Knights need a victory to force a three-way tie. The 5A teams aren't going to play a KC playoff if that happens. Instead, the athletic directors will use a scoring-margin formula to break the tie. They don't want to do a KC playoff on Monday to have the winning teams play in the postseason on Friday. \nIn the 4A classification, Rigby can win a district championship with a victory at Blackfoot. Should the Broncos win and Century defeat Preston, there would be a tie for the conference title. In that case, the 4A teams will flip a coin for playoff seeding. Pocatello and Preston have both been eliminated. \nThe 3A classification could probably be the most entertaining in both districts five and six. Staring in D6, Sugar-Salem can win the conference outright Thursday night with a win over Teton in Driggs. However, Teton can take the title with a win and some help from South Fremont if the Cougars can knock off Shelley. Be sure to catch Local News 8 at 6 p.m. I'll be live in Driggs with all of the scenarios for the Mountain Rivers Conference. \nIn District 5, the defending 3A state champion Snake River Panthers can win another district title Friday against Marsh Valley in Arimo. But, should the Eagles pull a major upset, that would leave Snake, Marsh and American Falls all at 1-1 in league play.In 2A, West Jefferson has already wrapped up the District 6 title while Aberdeen has won District 5. Enjoy the final weekend of the regular season! \nCopyright 2015 NPG of Idaho . All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
