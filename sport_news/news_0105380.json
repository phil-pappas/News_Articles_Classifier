However, in the second free practice (FP2) the two-time world champion clocked an impressive 2:00.246 seconds, and swapped his bridesmaid shoes with Pedrosa, who clocked a second-best time of 2:00:293s. Marquez, also a two-time champion, finished third quickest (2:00.472s) with veteran Rossi only managing eighth spot with 2:01.305s.\nFinally, after his machine had done the talking, Lorenzo couldn’t help but rub it in to Rossi at the post-practice presser. When asked to react to Rossi’s comments on Marquez helping Lorenzo to win, the Spaniard shot back: “It’s Rossi’s strategy and he has done it in the past too… he has tried to play around with the riders… but it’s obviously not the best strategy.”\nRossi is aiming for his 10th title, but if the practice times are even the smallest indication, his dream seems as hazy as the Sepang weather.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:33:41.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
