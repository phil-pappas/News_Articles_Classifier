Texas Tech\nTubby Smith's Red Raiders didn't get much love from his fellow coaches.\nTexas Tech finished a woeful 3-15 in Big 12 play last season and didn't have a single player average over 10.5 points per game. This team is in line for some progression though; the five freshmen who played significant minutes last season should be better prepared to handle the rigors of Big 12 conference play. 10.

That won't change this year.\nThe Horned Frogs' four Big 12 victories came over Texas Tech, Kansas State and Oklahoma State — not exactly the Big 12 murderer's row. Their three best players all graduated, leaving TCU scrambling to replace more than 30 points of production each night. 9. TCU\nTCU hasn't made the NCAA Tournament since 1998.

Kansas State\nWith all that's happened in Manhattan this offseason, it's a wonder the Wildcats garnered enough points to rank No. 8.\nLast year's leading scorer Marcus Foster, along with Malek Harris and Tre Harris, were kicked off the team, while sophomore guards Jevon Thomas and Nigel Johnson elected to transfer. Those losses, in addition to the graduations of Nino Williams (11.4 PPG, 5.3 RPG) and Thomas Gipson (11.3 PPG, 5.3 RPG), leave coach Bruce Weber with little chance of contending. 8.

Oklahoma State\nDespite an 8-10 record in conference play and a freefall to the finish, Oklahoma St. was gifted with a No. 9 seed in the NCAA Tournament.\nIt was a handout that might allow their talent to finally shine through. Wrong. They lost to Oregon 79-73 in the round of 64, putting a cap on a disappointing season.\nNow, with Le'Bryan Nash (17.2 PPG, 5.7 RPG), Anthony Hickey and Michael Cobbins gone, the backcourt duo of senior Phil Forte and freshman Jawun Evans will be relied on to carry a team that seems to underachieve every year. 7.

West Virginia\nThe Mountaineers were a mainstay in the Top 25 last season behind a balanced effort that saw six players average at least seven points.\nJuwan Staten is in Golden State, meaning they lack a reliable scoring presence, but this a team which thrives on defense. West Virginia led the nation both in steal rate and opponent turnover percentage, and scrapped their way into a ride to the sweet 16.\nWith a strong returning core, the Mountaineers should be doing some dancing come March. 6.

Baylor\nBaylor's 24-win season and No. 3 seed in the NCAA tournament don't mean a whole heck of a lot when you consider that they lost to No. 14 Georgia St. in the Round of 64.\nThey lost key seniors Kenny Chery and Royce O’Neal, but bring back Taurean Prince and Rico Gathers, perhaps the Big 12's most dyanmic inside-outside duo. Gathers will be complimented in the post by sophomore Jonathan Motley and 7-foot transfer Jo Acuil, which should deter teams from attacking too much.\nThis team is stocked with talent. Now, can coach Scott Drew put it all together? 5.

Texas\nShaka Smart inherits a squad with skilled upperclassmen, but several question marks.\nThe Longhorns shot just 43.3 percent last year, 184th among Division I teams. The offensive struggles of a season ago are troublesome, but Smart should instill some of his wisdom into a team that could thrive under his tutelage. 4.

Iowa State\nFred Hoiberg is off coaching Derrick Rose and Jimmy Butler in Chicago, so replacement Steve Prohm came to town to take the reigns of a team with lofty expectations.\nLed by the talented triumvirate of Geroges Niang, Monte Morris and Jameel McKay, the Cyclones were the only team who could siphon a first-place vote away from the Jayhawks.\nDespite the new leadership, the Cyclones are expected to maintain their high-octane offense and impose their scoring will on opponents. Now, they just have to avoid another first-round letdown. 3.

Oklahoma\nLed by All-American Buddy Hield, the Sooners are looking to one-up their run to the Sweet 16 from a year ago.\nOklahoma returns nearly its entire core, sans TaShawn Thomas, which will hurt the team's frontcourt depth, but shouldn't be enough to derail a what could be Lon Kruger's best season at the helm. 2.

Kansas\nIn the Big 12, placing Kansas at the top is as natural as breathing.\nThe Jayhawks received all but one first place vote, and with four starters returning from a 25-win team, plus highly-touted freshman Cheick Diallo in town, it's no surprise that KU is expected to capture another Big 12 title.\nDiallo hasn't been cleared to officially play this season, but if the NCAA grants him eligibility, the 6-foot-9 Mali native could be the final piece that propels Bill Self's team back into the Final Four for the first time since 2012. 1.
