Aller / Getty Images) Mark Wogenrich Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call Penn State football, Christian Hackenberg, quarterback, offense, criticism, James Franklin, Ricky Rahne \nIf not for recruiting, Penn State quarterbacks coach Ricky Rahne said, he wouldn't have accounts on Twitter or Facebook. Since he does, though, Rahne has come across some of the criticisms of the Lions' offense and its starting quarterback. \nEven as he instructs his quarterbacks to \"ignore the noise,\" both good and bad, Rahne still pointedly addressed one point that irked him: the notion that Christian Hackenberg doesn't fit Penn State's current offense. \n\"Christian's skill set fits [Penn State's offense] very well,\" Rahne said. \"It's about accuracy, intelligence, decision-making and being athletic enough to make plays with your feet. Christian's skill set fits a variety of offenses. I think that's a bit overblown.\" \nYet, the perception lingers through five weeks of Penn State's season â€” and 18 games of James Franklin time at Penn State. The Lions, who host Indiana today, have not been the aggressive, high-intensity \"sexy\" offense that Franklin projected when he took the job in 2014. \nObviously, a long set of mitigating circumstances have affected that. Offensive line depth and consistency, youth at skill positions, injuries and even weather have forced Penn State's offense into a reduction act this season. \nFranklin said as much following the team's season-opening, 27-10 loss to Temple, which sacked Hackenberg 10 times. The Lions would become more deliberate, favoring a ball-control offense hinging on the run and short-passing game to protect the line, the ball and, most important, the quarterback. \nSince then, Hackenberg has been sacked just five times in four games and intercepted once. He also has just one game with more than 200 yards passing. \nRahne said Penn State runs a \"multiple offense,\" eschewing the notion that it's a spread-based approach that requires a running quarterback. Besides, Rahne said, Hackenberg is more mobile than people think, which he displayed on a first-down scramble on third-and-15 last week against Army. \n\"Obviously when it's there, I would love to see him take off,\" Rahne said. \"I think he's athletic enough to do so. He's got the build to be able to protect himself if he does. But if it's not there, he's not going to force the issue.\" \nLikewise, Penn State hasn't been prone to forcing the issue downfield. Most of his throws are short, lower-risk attempts in a quick game or on rollouts. Last week, Penn State timed two of its deep shots on back-to-back plays in the second half, leading to a key touchdown against the Black Knights. \nHackenberg said he wants to hit those deep chances at 50 percent. Franklin, meanwhile, said he'd like to give the quarterback some more opportunities to try. \n\"That first week [against Temple], we had some real challenges that made it difficult to win, when you play the way we played,\" Franklin said. \"So the way we're calling the game is going to manage some of those issues and also give us the ability to reduce plays turnovers. We've got to build on it, but we've got to continue to be more aggressive in spots.\" \nAnd that doesn't mean solely with Hackenberg throwing deep against single coverage. Penn State is converting third downs at a 30-percent rate, which is last in the Big Ten and tied for 119 t h nationally. \nOften, those missed conversions happen on third-and-long downs, which Penn State forced upon itself with unsuccessful first-down plays. For Hackenberg, and Franklin, that means becoming more unpredictable on early downs. \n\"A lot of times, when things aren't going well on offense, everything you're doing is about managing; trying to get into manageable third-down situations,\" Franklin said. \"But that can come back to haunt you if you're too conservative. ... You've got to take your shots, mix them in. We're going to need to do that moving forward.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:29:08.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
