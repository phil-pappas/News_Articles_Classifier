Eli Manning’s (two rings) Peyton Manning’s (one ring) \nNajee Goode replaced Ryans in the second half. Back from injuries \nRyan Mathews started for the Eagles at running back even though he was questionable with a groin injury. Mathews rushed for 3 yards on the Eagles' first offensive play of the game and had 20 first-half rushing yards. \nOdell Beckham Jr. was active for the Giants after missing practice leading up to the game with a hamstring injury. Beckham did not look impaired by the injury of the first half, catching seven passes for 61 yards and a touchdown. \nThe Eagles dressed all four running backs because Nelson Agholor was out with an ankle injury. The inactive players were Agholor, Alonso, Kendricks, quarterback Thad Lewis, cornerback Denzel Rice, offensive lineman Tanner Hawkinson, and defensive end Brandon Bair. \nAgholor, Alonso (knee), Kendricks (hamstring), and Bair (groin) were declared out on Saturday. Hawkinson was signed last week and is still learning the system. Rice and Lewis are usually healthy scratches. Jordan Hicks started in place of Kendricks at inside linebacker and Josh Huff started in Agholor's place at wide receiver. Hall of Famers \nThe Eagles inducted Brian Westbrook and Maxie Baughan into the team's Hall of Fame during a halftime ceremony. Westbrook played eight seasons for the Eagles from 2002-09 after a standout career at Villanova. He is the franchise's all-time leader in yards from scrimmage with 9,785 yards. \nHe led the team onto the field flanked by former teammates Brian Dawkins and Donovan McNabb in Westbrook jerseys. \n\"I'm excited about the opportunity, but I'm also humbled and a little bit overwhelmed,\" Westbrook told reporters before the game. \"This is a major thing. I'm being mentioned with greats like McNabb, Dawkins, Maxie Baughan, Van Buren, Chuck Bednarik. These are the best to ever play in Philadelphia and to have my name mentioned with those guys is a humbling thing.\" \nBaughan played six of 12 seasons with the Eagles. He was the 20th overall pick in the 1960 draft and started every game at linebacker to help the Eagles to their third NFL championship.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:32:56.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
