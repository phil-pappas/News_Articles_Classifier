Of course, it also helps he hits massive home runs like the one he hit Wednesday in the seventh inning to give the Blue Jays the lead over the Rangers.\nAdChoices One fan, decked out in gear and even sporting a fake beard, shows off his home run swing as the real Bautista was busy blasting a huge three-run shot.\nThe video couldn’t have asked for better timing. It moves straight from the kid’s swing to the ball traveling towards them in the left field stands. They were a bit too far up to have a chance at catching the ball, but that would have been unbelievable anyway.\nThis was Toronto’s first home playoff win since winning the World Series in 1993, so an entire generation of Canadians have not been able to experience this level of excitement on the diamond. After Wednesday’s game, the excitement won’t be dying down any time soon.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAftFZu.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Bautista&#39;s", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Off", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAftAbF.img&quot;}}", "https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Who", "https://www.fanduel.com/insider/feed/&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "https://www.fanduel.com/insider/2015/10/15/mini-jose-bautista-times-swing-perfectly-with-home-run/&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;FanDuel&quot;,&quot;sourceLogo&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Mini", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAftjYA.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Thursday&#39;s", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfsVLN.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Check", "https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;baseball_mlb&quot;},&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&quot;,&quot;FWNetworkId&quot;:188286,&quot;FWServer&quot;:&quot;http://2df7e.v.fwmrm.net&quot;,&quot;HybridPlayerAdInitT"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:53:40.846+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
