It was the exact opposite of how the Bears scripted their rookie center's NFL debut.\nChiefs linebacker Ramik Wilson held up the football, completing a disastrous sequence that amplified fears about the Bears' patchwork offensive line. Worst of all, Grasu was one of the culprits in a multifaceted breakdown.\nSack. Fumble. Touchdown.\nAs it turned out, though, Grasu was a microcosm of the entire team in its 18-17 comeback victory. The Bears' third-round pick rallied from the early adversity and played serviceably against a powerful Chiefs defensive line.\nAnd in a season characterized by a search for building blocks, Grasu emerged from his first game convinced it was a critical milestone in his development.\n\"You can't practice that whole game,\" he said. \"You can't practice that whole final drive. You've just got to go through it.\"\nGrasu did so against a pair of imposing linemen. Nose tackle Dontari Poe and left defensive end Jaye Howard pushed Grasu back on run blocks at times, but they didn't wreck the game.\nAnd Grasu held up well enough in pass protection as quarterback Jay Cutler engineered two touchdown drives in the final 8 minutes.\n\"I thought he did great,\" left guard Matt Slauson said. \"He was confident. He battled all day. It wasn't perfect, but none of us up front can say we played a perfect game.\"\nIt certainly didn't start well.\nOn second-and-11 from the Bears' 8 in the first quarter, the Chiefs defensive line ran a stunt. The Bears recognized it from their video study during the week, but the Chiefs added a wrinkle to the back side of the pick play.\nHoward and Poe slanted to the right, while right defensive end Allen Bailey looped behind both of them. Wilson also blitzed from his inside linebacker spot, forcing the Bears line to adjust midplay.\nHoward beat right guard Vladimir Ducasse with a vicious two-handed swipe, then bulled through Grasu. Cutler lamented not holding on to the ball as he took the sack.\n\"It was a good play by them,\" Grasu said. \"What's even better was the way we responded and kept fighting the whole game.\"\nSaid coach John Fox: \"It's Katy bar the door, man. It's like a bar fight. You don't have time to have your little normal conversations. You just adjust, set your helmet back straight and learn how to adjust. He did a fine job and we expected him to.\"\nGrasu was responsible for most of the pre-snap pass protection calls. However, Slauson helped him with any changes that had to be made late in the process.\nSlauson would make the necessary adjustments, then tap Grasu's leg to signal they were ready. That worked out well because the Bears operated in a silent count, anyway, because of the crowd noise.\n\"It was crisp, it was clean,\" Slauson said. \"Me and him worked really well together.\"\nAnd by the game's end, they were the ones celebrating.\nrcampbell@tribpub.com\nTwitter @Rich_Campbell\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Hroniss Grasu Chicago Bears Kansas City Chiefs Jaye Howard Dontari Poe NFL Vladimir Ducasse", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561b1c0b/turbine/ct-hroniss-grasu-side-bears-chiefs-spt-1012-20151011"], "published": "2015-10-12T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:10:00.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
