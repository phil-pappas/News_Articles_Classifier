Related: Family rallies to raise funds for congenital heart defect research \nEvery now and then, 16-month-old Landon Jones coos. \n“That’s his happy noise,” says mom Autumn Jones of Chippewa Township, a sound she loves to hear. \nHe’s a charmer when he dons bright green sunglasses, a size or two too big for his melt-your-heart face with big, blue eyes, chubby cheeks and ready smile. \nLandon wears a Superman shirt, appropriate attire for a little tousle-haired boy who spent the first 5½ months of his life in a hospital. \n“He’s our superhero,” Autumn said. \nLandon was born June 3 a year ago with a rare, congenital heart defect called Shone’s Complex. \n“It was a shock,” said Autumn, because none of her prenatal tests indicated anything abnormal. “I felt great.” \nEverything was fine at her 20-week scan, she said, but when she visited her obstetrician for an ultrasound 37 weeks into her pregnancy (normal term is considered 39 to 40 weeks), fluid levels were below normal. She was referred to Allegheny Health Network’s West Penn Hospital in Pittsburgh for more refined tests. \nAutumn and husband, Vinny, drove to Pittsburgh one morning expecting to be home by early afternoon, she said. \nAfter fetal scans and imaging, doctors felt it best to induce labor, resorting to a Caesarean section after 30 hours. \n“It was kind of surreal. I didn’t realize how serious everything was,” she said. \nLandon, weighing 7 pounds, 8 ounces at birth, was monitored in the hospital’s neonatal intensive-care unit. \nAn echocardiogram revealed the complexity of his condition. Landon was transferred to Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh’s cardiac intensive-care unit. \nFurther tests pinpointed Shone’s complex manifesting with multiple defects to both the aorta -- the main artery of the body that distributes oxygenated blood -- and mitral valve, which helps control blood flow. Landon has three of four defects characterizing Shone’s. And his left ventricle, which receives oxygenated blood and pumps it to tissues throughout the body, was small and underdeveloped, meaning he wasn’t getting enough oxygen. \n“I felt like the rug was pulled out from beneath me,” Autumn said. \nEven with her medical background -- she’s a family nurse practitioner -- and her husband’s mechanical knowledge -- he’s an engineer, neither had heard of Shone’s complex. Nor did Landon’s doting uncle, Don Jones, Vinny’s brother and a pharmacy technician. \nDon, who like Autumn and Vinny has done extensive research on the heart defect, said in the last 15 years, only 50 cases of complete Shone’s complex have been reported. \nThe couple hardly recognized their baby, lying in an incubator with a breathing tube and multiple IV lines. \nAt 13 days old, Landon underwent the first of three open-heart surgeries he needs. His chest remained open for two days, Autumn said. \n“That scarred me for life, seeing that. His chest open, seeing his heart beat.” \nHis second open-heart surgery was at 4 months, but due to complications, he required additional surgery three days later. His chest had to be reopened yet again after he developed a surgical site infection, necessitating antibiotics intravenously for eight weeks. Four times, once while in his mother’s arms, Landon stopped breathing. \n“He was intubated and extubated eight times in one month,” Autumn said. \nNov. 12, 2014, after 162 days in the hospital, 52 of them in cardiac ICU, Landon was able to go home. \n“It was awesome,” Autumn said, especially arriving home to be greeted by a big sign placed in the yard by family that said, “Welcome home, and we love you.” \nAutumn admitted that it was “a little scary leaving the hospital, but bringing Landon home -- “honestly, that was one of the best days ever.” \nLandon was discharged with a peripherally inserted central catheter -- more commonly referred to as a PICC line -- a form of intravenous access to administer nutrition that was removed after three weeks. \nHis parents received PICC training before leaving the hospital, and Autumn said her nursing training helped, as did Vinny’s mechanical engineering and math background. \nLandon required multiple medications multiple times a day. \n“That first month was really rough,” Autumn said. \nUntil a month ago, he received physical and developmental therapy to “get on target as far as his development,” said Autumn. \n“A lot is his older brother,” she said, crediting 3½-year-old Camden. “He (Landon) wants to keep up with him. I say Camden is his best therapy.” \nAutumn remains optimistic. \n“Twenty years ago if he had been born with this,” she said, “they would have just sent him home with comfort care to live a couple of days.” \nBut congenital heart defect research has come a long way, she said, to help patients with Shone’s, a complex first identified in 1963. \n“His future looks pretty bright, but nothing is set in stone with Landon,” she said. \nHe needed a heart catheterization in August after an abnormality registered on an echocardiogram. He’ll be under the care of a cardiologist for the rest of his life and will need the third of three open-heart surgeries sometime within the next year or so, she said. \n“He’s at risk for a lot of problems, you know, stroke, infection, liver problems are kind of common with kids and adults that have his defect,” she said. \nAnd eventually, he may need a heart transplant, but she hopes that’s 20 years down the road. \n“For now, he’s doing great,” Autumn said. “He walks around, runs around and gets into everything like a typical toddler should. Him and his brother play together just like normal toddlers. They fight together just like normal toddlers as well. It definitely makes life interesting.” \nLandon likes toys that make noise -- a cuddly bear dressed in a train conductor’s pinstriped coveralls, cap and red kerchief that sings “I’ve Been Working on the Railroad.” And cars, trucks, trains and balloons, said Vinny. \n“He likes to eat. Animal Crackers are his favorite thing in life,” his dad said. \nAnd adores his 5-month-old baby sister, Scarlett. \n“He finally grasped the concept he has to be gentle with her,” Autumn said. \nNearly every day this summer, they played outside to make up for last summer when Landon was in the hospital. \nBut as he grows older, Landon will have restrictions -- no contact sports or endurance sports like track and field. \n“We’re thankful for each day,” Autumn said. “We count our blessings as they come and we take it one day at time.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T11:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:23:03.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
