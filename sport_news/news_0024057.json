The Patriots have won the Independence race all six years it’s been run. \n“We have our eyes set on November and some very specific goals,” said coach Jason Staggers. \n“We’ve never won the section and we hope that we can compete with Northern Highlands there.” \nIronically, the last girls team to throw a shutout in a division meet, Clifton, won the Liberty, 39-42-50 over Passaic Tech and Bergen Tech despite nearly having no one in the top five. \nThe Mustangs, who swept the Liberty race in 2010 were led by junior Anisha Khandakar, who finished fifth. Bergen Tech went 1-2 behind race-winner Michelle Kubasek, working her way back from a chronic shin splints problem. \nFellow senior Abigail McLaughlin who finished only 20 yards behind and then Passaic Tech went 3-4-6 led by Sarah Shannon. But Clifton took the next five spots after Passaic Tech’s third and its gap from 1-6 was only 56 seconds, albeit about a minute slower than Wayne Hills’ 1-5 margin. \n“I’m really proud of this team,” said Clifton coach John Pontes. “This might have been a surprise to some but knowing these girls like I do nothing surprises me. \n“There’s no animosity on this team and they always work together towards a common goal,” said Pontes, whose girls team has won or shared a title in one division or another since 2004. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:35:36.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
