The Steelers defense holds several veterans, including cornerback William Gay and linebackers James Harrison and Lawrence Timmons who have led the defensive line, as well as defensive end Cameron Heyward. Pittsburgh also added several new defensive looks that leave their opponents baffled. \nIn order for the Chiefs to fight against a tough defensive line, they too will have to show a strong defensive end. Outside linebacker Justin Houston will have a big impact on this week’s game by providing a strong defense. \nHouston had a slow first three weeks, but with last week’s game against Minnesota, he showed what he came to play for. Houston has four sacks for the season. This weekend, he will be up against an offensive line that has allowed 16 sacks to pass through this season. \nIn the past, Houston is known for stopping the run. Last season, he accounted for 68 tackles. This season, however, he has shown to perform well against the pass, demonstrated by his four sacks and accumulated hurries. \nHouston has also played well against the run. According to SB Nation , Pro Football Focus ranked Houston as the 4th outside linebacker against the run, due to his ability to adjust to variety of plays. \nHouston has found a balance between making his tackles and performing well in overall speed. This is a quality that not all linebackers can perfect. With this, Houston will have a grave impact on this upcoming game against the Steelers. \n— Edited by Dani Malakoff \n\"Travis Kelce\" \nWesley Dotson: @WesleyDee23 \nThe Kansas City Chiefs have had a considerably tough start this season. Their dreadful 1-5 record has them dead last in the AFC West. Star running back Jamaal Charles is likely lost for the season with a torn ACL. Coach Andy Reid can’t help but put the burden of Kansas City’s struggles on himself as he tries to figure out how his team can turn its season around. \nIf that turnaround is going to begin this Sunday against the Pittsburgh Steelers, it will have to be in large part due to tight end Travis Kelce and his production level. \nKelce recorded five catches for 88 yards last Sunday against the Minnesota Vikings, the most yards he's had since his monster Week 1 performance of six catches for 106 yards. There is no denying he is vital to the Chiefs’ success, especially with the loss of Charles. \nQuarterback Alex Smith is at his best when throwing the ball between one and 20 yards; he owns a passer rating of 93.8 in that situation. This is where a solid amount of Kelce’s routes fall into and why Kelce is one of Smith’s favorite targets because of Kelce’s ability to out-jump defenders for balls with his 6-foot-5 frame. \nThe Steelers defense is not quite what is used to be when it was under former defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau. Safeties Troy Polamalu and Ryan Clark and cornerback Ike Taylor, three players that were key pieces to the Pittsburgh defense over the years, have all retired. Linebacker James Harrison, now 37, is not what he used to be on the defensive line. \nAll of these factors play into why the Steelers defense ranks 23rd in the NFL in passing yards allowed per game (376.5). Opposing quarterbacks have had success against this defense so far this season, and Smith will need to take advantage on Sunday as well. \nIf Smith can find a rhythm, expect Kelce to have a huge game. With Kelce’s size, he's a tough cover for any defense, but he could cause even more problems for Pittsburgh. \nKelce has all the potential in the world to turn into an elite tight end. The Chiefs saw it in Week 1 when he bullied the Texans defense on his way to a 106-yard, two-touchdown performance. \nIf Kansas City is going to turn its season around, it will all have to start with the rising tight end Travis Kelce, who has a great chance to make a big-time impact against this struggling Steelers pass defense. \n— Edited by Dani Malakoff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:10:52.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
