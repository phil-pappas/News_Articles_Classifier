Ten seasons in the NFL will do that once you learn things are never as bad as they seem and never as good either.\nStill, the Jets perennial left tackle is clearly giddy about his team’s 3-1 start, following a 27-14 win over the Dolphins Sunday in London. A bye week looms, but Ferguson made clear it’s no time for the Jets to rest on their laurels. It’s time to prepare mentally and physically for the 12-game stretch that will decide their season.\n“After this bye week, we’ll take a look at our next opponent and then take it one step at a time and try to impose our will and continue down this road,” he said during a conference call on Monday.\nCall it the Brick-A-Law: “Impose our will.” It’s been a while since the Jets’ offense could be as big a bully as its defense. But it has been this season blending a rugged game headed by power back Chris Ivory with a competent passing game in which wide receiver Brandon Marshall is the best physical presence the Jets have had at the position since Keyshawn Johnson.\nAt the core of it all is the offensive line that rebounded from a poor showing against the Eagles to dominate the Dolphins. The Jets rushed for 207 yards, passed for another 218 and didn’t allow a sack. Brian Winters started at right guard for the injured Willie Colon and didn’t miss a beat teaming with Ferguson, right tackle Breno Giacomini, center Nick Mangold and left guard James Carpenter to dominate time of possession 37:23 to 22:37.\n“When you can have a dynamic running game, it helps so many different areas of your overall game,” Ferguson said. “Guys have to honor things because if they don’t pay attention we’re certainly going to make them pay.”\nQuarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick is especially pleased by the zero sacks allowed against the Dolphins and just two sacks allowed on the season. Offensive coordinator Chan Gailey had suggested Fitzpatrick wore down during the time he was a starter in Buffalo during the 2011 and 2012 seasons. He was sacked 52 times during those two years.\n“The guys up front have done a great job so far,” Fitzpatrick said. “You can see that by the way we’ve been able to run the ball and you can see it by the low number of sacks we have. I know those guys take a lot of pride and work hard. We’ve got a smart, experienced group up front. That makes for a good team.”\nThe bye week will help Colon heal and only strengthen the overall depth of the unit that carries the attitude. Giacomini and Colon don’t really get warmed up until they get into a scuffle, while Ferguson and Mangold, both 31, haven’t lost a step. What the Jets need to fine-tune is their consistency.\n“They’ve been playing pretty good for the most part,” head coach Todd Bowles said. “I thought they did a good job [against the Dolphins]. They stepped up, accepted the challenge and played physical.”\nFerguson has challenged his teammates to do it every week once they return from the bye. He and Mangold have been to the AFC Championship game twice, only to lose one game short of the Super Bowl. They’ve got a real shot this year if things can go well over the next 12 games.\n“Now that we’ve got a rhythm going, guys are excited about the chance they have to contribute to this team and put more W’s in the win column,” Ferguson said. “We just need to continue to work on the small things and keep practicing hard so that when we start facing these teams we can determine what we want to do and guys will have to work that much harder to prevent what we do well.”\nWith the offensive line as its anchor.\n  d'brickashaw ferguson ,  new york jets ,  ryan fitzpatrick", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T04:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T11:08:54.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
