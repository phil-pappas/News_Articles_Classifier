Madeline will be playing Lady Macbeth, wife of the protagonist Lord Macbeth. “It just takes a lot of work and a lot of dedication and it’s cool to be exposed to that at my age.”\nMadeline has appeared in several other productions, both in the community and at school, since moving from upstate New York last summer, including “Mary Poppins” and “The Last Days of Judas Iscariot.”\nIn addition to Macbeth, Madeline is currently working on a production of “Arcadia” with the Gestalt Theater Project.\nShe plans to explore all facets of theater as career options, including directing and writing in addition to acting. Madeline hopes to pursue these goals next year at a university in the midwest, possibly the University of Iowa or Minnesota.\nWhile her passion for acting is manifold, she explained that getting inside a character’s head is what draws her in.\n“It’s an opportunity to delve into a mind that may or may not be similar to your own, and it teaches you empathy and compassion and makes you a very self aware person,” she said. “That’s what I think interests me about it.”\nContact the writer: community@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvx936-b88532700z.120151008145711000g47cf4gc.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvx936-b88532700z.120151008145711000g47cf4gc.10.jpg", "http://gestalttheatreproject.com/"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T17:55:19.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
