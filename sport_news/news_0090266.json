It even has an overboost function to add 26 lb.-ft. more torque in the mid-RPM range.\nOnce beyond highway speeds, it is best to take the M2 to the track. With that in mind, BMW developed the M2's oil system, with an extra pump to keep lubricant flowing to the engine's vital parts, even during the hard cornering of a race track.\nThe M2's electronic stability control system features an M Dynamic Mode, built to flog around a racetrack in lurid drifts without having to entirely deactivate this hot little Beemer's electronic safety net.\nBMW will announce the price closer to launch, but the fun, zippy M2 stands to be a solid buy.\nFor the latest car news, follow @MaximRides and Dan Carney on Twitter.", "external_links": ["http://www.bmwusa.com/", "http://twitter.com/maximrides", "http://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2012/06/ford-focus-st-ecoboost-fiat-abarth-overboost/1#.Vh2ZiBNVhBc", "http://twitter.com/autowriterdan", "http://www.bmwblog.com/2015/07/09/dct-transmission-how-they-work-and-why-we-use-them/"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:39:56.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
