Beckett said he knew all eyes would be on him, especially since he used to play for the Tigers.\n\"I had two days to reminisce about it,\" he said about the loss. \"Now it's time to come out and put on a show. I had to show my teammates that the season isn't over because of one loss.\"\nBeckett intercepted Nansemond River quarterback Kiere Landry in the opening minutes and returned it 30 yards for the touchdown. The Braves rolled from there, winning 41-13.\n\"I was more worried that if I didn't come out and ball, who would be the leader,\" said Beckett, who finished with eight tackles. \"But I knew if I came out and did what I had to do, then it would spark our offense and our defense.\"\nThe Braves added two more touchdowns on runs by Tyain Smith and Omar Butler. They also got two field goals from Grant Dafoe to take a commanding 27-0 lead.\nIndian River coach Glenwood Ferebee said he had wondered how his team would respond to Saturday's loss, but was confident the Braves wouldn't come out flat.\n\"No, I wasn't because I know the kids,\" he said. \"They were hurt but at the same time they're still competitive. We just had to get that bad taste out of our mouths from Satur-day.\"\nThis game was postponed from Oct. 1 because of inclement weather. The Braves started to get tired in the second half. It didn't help that the game dragged, too, lasting nearly three hours.\n\"They died at the end because they were tired, which is expected, but we still have to play disciplined football,\" Ferebee said after his team gave up 13 second-half points and committed 15 penalties. \"We're just trying to maintain until Friday.\"\nIndian River will travel to play Deep Creek on Friday; the Warriors (3-3) will host Great Bridge.\nStats: NR-Kiere Landry 13-33-1, 136 yards, 2 TDs passing. IR-Tyre Givers-Wilson 13-26-0, 181 yards, 2 TDs passing. Tyain Smith 8-67, TD rushing.\nLarry Rubama, 757-446-2273,larry.rubama@pilotonline.com, Twitter: @LHRubama\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image. Buy Pilot photos here.\nLoading...
