The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 0.1 percent to 2,017.46. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.3 percent to 17,131.86. The Nasdaq composite climbed 0.2 percent to 4,838.64. \nBenchmark U.S. crude oil rose to near $47.50 per barrel following a drop of more than $2.50. \nThe dollar weakened against the yen and was nearly unchanged against the euro. \nMADOFF FRAUD-LAWSUIT \nWashington investors seek to pin Madoff losses on auditors \nSEATTLE (AP) — Nearly seven years after Bernie Madoff’s investment empire was revealed to be a $17.5 billion fraud, the battle by investors to recover their losses ramps up with jury selection that began Monday in a case in Seattle. \nA Washington state investment company is seeking to pin about $100 million of its losses from Madoff’s crimes on auditor Ernst & Young. \nFutureSelect Portfolio Management of Redmond and some related firms, headed by hedge fund manager Ronald Ward, lost a total of about $129 million in the pyramid scheme. In court papers, the company alleges that Ernst & Young would have uncovered the scheme if it had taken even the most basic steps to verify Madoff’s assets — something the auditing firm denies it had any obligation to do. \nThe case was initially dismissed, then revived by an appeals court. Washington state’s Supreme Court denied a bid by the defendants to have the case transferred to New York or to apply New York law, which would not have allowed the lawsuit. Ernst & Young is the only defendant so far heading to trial; most of the others have reached confidential settlement agreements. \nCHINA-TRADE \nChina September imports plunge in new sign of weakness \nBEIJING (AP) — China’s imports fell by an unexpectedly wide margin in September in a new sign of weakness in the world’s second-largest economy. \nNew customs data shows imports plunged 20.4 percent from a year earlier to $145.2 billion, worse than August’s 5.5 percent decline and analysts’ expectations of a decline of about 15 percent. Exports shrank 3.7 percent, though that was an improvement from the previous month’s 13.8 percent decline. \nWeakness in trade has fueled doubts Beijing can hit its economic growth target this year of about 7 percent. \nMuch of China’s slowdown over the past five years was self-imposed as the ruling Communist Party tries to steer the economy to more self-sustaining growth based on domestic consumption. But the past year’s unexpectedly deep decline has raised fears of politically dangerous job losses. \nThe government has cut interest rates five times since November and pumped money into the economy through spending on public works construction. Economic growth held steady in the quarter ending in July at 7 percent. But that was the lowest rate since the 2008 global crisis. \nECONOMY-THE DAY AHEAD \nMajor business and economic events scheduled for Tuesday \nWASHINGTON (AP) — Traders will be focusing on corporate earnings this week as they try to assess the impact that slowing global growth is having on company profits. \nJohnson & Johnson gets things going this morning, reporting its quarterly financial results before the market opens. CSX and JP Morgan Chase issue their results after the market closes. \nOverall, earnings are forecast to slide by 5.3 percent, compared with the same period last year, as overseas demand weakened. But much of that decline is due to a big slump in energy company profits. S&P Capital IQ forecasts earnings in the energy sector slid by 66 percent. \nStill, some analysts are confident that the outlook for companies will improve next year, as demand revives overseas and improving consumer confidence boosts the U.S. economy. Scott Wren at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, says this earnings season will be a “confirmation process,” showing inflation is low and the economy is growing moderately, but “fairly dependably.” \nAlso on the schedule, for this afternoon, Treasury releases federal budget data for fiscal year 2015. \nNYC INFRASTRUCTURE \nExperts: Cash infusion would aid NYC transit, isn’t cure-all \nNEW YORK (AP) — Transit experts say a planned $29 billion infusion into New York City’s transportation network will help but not completely overhaul the massive system. \nA deal was brokered over the weekend that includes $2.5 billion from the city and $8.3 billion from the state. \nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s five-year modernization plan funds 1,000 new subway cars, more real-time countdown clocks and track repairs. \nBut many transportation experts argue that the capital-spending program is mostly a maintenance plan rather than a blueprint for a robust transportation system for a 21st-century global city. \nLocal officials have said more ambitious plans aren’t possible without significantly more federal funding. \nGov. Andrew Cuomo (KWOH’-moh) and Mayor Bill de Blasio (dih BLAH’-zee-oh praised it Monday as improving straphangers’ commutes. \nDISSOLVING HEART STENTS \nDissolving stent for heart arteries passes first large test \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Abbott Vascular’s dissolving heart stent has passed its first major test. \nIn a large, one-year study published online by the New England Journal of Medicine, doctors found the Absorb stent performed as well as a conventional stent. \nStents are tiny mesh cages that keep blood vessels from reclogging after artery-opening procedures. They are used on about 850,000 people each year in the United States alone. \nThe stents available now in the U.S. are permanent metal implants. Abbott’s Absorb stent, which is already sold in Europe, works like dissolving stitches. It’s made of a material that degrades over several years. It performed as well as but not better than a conventional stent for preventing reclogging in the one-year study. \nWISCONSIN GUN SHOP-LAWSUIT \nJurors weigh whether gun shop should be held liable for shooting of police officers \nMILWAUKEE (AP) — A jury in Wisconsin is weighing whether the owners of a gun shop should be held financially responsible for a crime committed with a weapon purchased at their store. \nTwo Milwaukee police officers are suing the shop for several million dollars after they were shot by a suspect using a gun purchased at Badger Guns by a straw buyer. Lawyers for the officers told jurors there were several tipoffs that should have been sufficient to cancel the sale, including improperly marked forms and the behavior of the buyer and the eventual recipient, who was too young to buy the weapon. \nAttorneys defending the owner and operators of Badger Guns and its predecessor, Badger Outdoors, said in closing arguments Monday that their clients were not negligent but were duped by the straw buyer. \nAuthorities have said more than 500 firearms recovered from crime scenes had been traced back to Badger Guns and Badger Outdoors, making it the “No. 1 crime gun dealer in America.” \nDAILY FANTASY LEGALITY \nAuthor of anti-gambling law says “sheer chutzpah” for daily fantasy sites to claim legitimacy \nLAS VEGAS (AP) — The U.S. congressman who drafted the 2006 legislation used by DraftKings and FanDuel as proof of their legitimacy says is it’s “sheer chutzpah” for the daily fantasy sites to pretend the law makes them legal. \nFormer congressman Jim Leach says lawmakers had no idea daily fantasy sports would “morph into today’s cauldron of daily betting.” He says his anti-gambling act was supposed to stop gambling on the Internet, not promote it. \nLeach says the carve out for fantasy sports in the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (UIGEA) does not provide them with immunity against other federal and state laws that could limit their activities. \nDaily fantasy sites have long claimed that the fantasy sports provision in the 2006 anti-gambling law allows them to operate freely in the 45 states that don’t have specific prohibitions on the contests. FanDuel and DraftKings both promote themselves as offering games of skill, shying away from the label of gambling. \nFILM-VOLKSWAGEN SCANDAL \nDiCaprio, Paramount option Volkswagen scandal book proposal \nLOS ANGELES (AP) — The Volkswagen clean diesel emissions scandal is still chugging along, but Hollywood already has its eyes on a possible movie about the ordeal. \nParamount Pictures and Leonardo DiCaprio’s production company Appian Way have optioned the rights to a book proposal from New York Times journalist Jack Ewing about the ongoing debacle. \nThe German automaker admitted last month that 11 million of its vehicles worldwide were fitted with cheating software to beat emission tests. VW chief Martin Winterkorn resigned after the scandal broke in the U.S., saying he was not aware of any wrongdoing on his part. \nEwing’s still-untitled book will explore the “more, better, faster” ethos and how it played into the scandal. \nDiCaprio, an active environmentalist, would serve as a producer on the project.
