She designed her own shirt for the Masina family member who will be out in Los Angeles this weekend: It spells out \"UTAH\" in horizontal type, and \"USC\" in vertical type, with the schools sharing the \"U.\" It lists the names and numbers of her sons, Uaea and Osa, who will be playing in the game.\nIt will be the first time anyone can remember the brothers on opposing sidelines.\n\"I'm gonna be cheering the whole game,\" she said. \"Just for whoever is on defense.\"\n  It's a unique dilemma as the No. 3 Utes face the Trojans this weekend at the Coliseum. Sophomore Uaea Masina is a linebacker for Utah, while five-star recruit Osa elected to leave his home state to join USC.\nOsa has seen significant time at inside linebacker, where he has 22 tackles and recovered a fumble for a 46-yard touchdown in his first college game. Uaea is a reserve who has made two tackles this year, but could get more reps with starter Jared Norris' uncertain status this week.\nBoth are ready for the possibility that they could go head-to-head on special teams.\n\"It's hard to explain, because in high school, we were on the same side, and now we'll face each other, and it's like, 'What's gonna happen?'\" Uaea said. \"Mom's happy because she can cheer for both of us. She'd probably be more mad if one of us blew out the other.\"\nThe weekend represents more than just a brotherly reunion. Osa was one of Utah's big in-state recruiting targets last year, along with his teammate and fellow linebacker Porter Gustin. Both Masina and Gustin have been playing this year for USC (3-3), and will be trying to take down the team that once courted them.\nThe duo were the top two in-state prospects in a banner year for Utah football talent. The Utes whiffed on both, who committed to Steve Sarkisian.\nTwo months into the season, Sarkisian is gone after off-field troubles led to his firing. But both Masina and Gustin are steadfast: They'll continue to fight on at USC.\n\"We miss Sark, but we think Coach [Clay Helton] is great,\" Gustin said. \"You make friends along the way here, in the weight room, in practice. Everything kinda comes together. I'm good friends with my position coach, Scott Felix. I'm always with him, and that helps out.\"\nThe Gustin family has remained equally gung-ho about the Trojans. Scarlett Gustin, Porter's mother, said she painted her toe nails cardinal and gold in anticipation for the upcoming game. She's been to all but two games this year with her husband.\nOn Sarkisian's midseason exit, the family was hurt to see a man they've come to care about struggle. The former coach is currently in rehab. \n\"Coach Sarkisian is a really good man, I think he just ran into some problems,\" Scarlett Gustin said. \"It put everybody in a bind, so that part is not very fun for everybody, but I hope he gets better.\"\nOsa told the LA Daily news this week that his freshman season had not gone \"how I'd pictured.\" But he, too, is a committed Trojan. Tamina said he picked his school for the players, the education, the location, the setting. He knew full well that coaches come and go.\nUaea called Osa not long after the news dropped. He knew at that moment, Osa needed a brother. Uaea related how he handled the offseason departure of Kalani Sitake, a coach he was close with.\n\"I just wanted to make sure he was all right with everything going on,\" he said, \"and if he needed anything I could give him.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:39:49.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
