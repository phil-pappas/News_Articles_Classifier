Beating them on the road with their postseason on the line is an entirely different and much more difficult thing.\nSantaluces did it on Friday.\nJunior tailback D'Marco Westmoreland bullied his way in for a 14-yard touchdown midway through the fourth quarter to lead the Chiefs to a come-from-behind 7-3 upset victory over rival Lake Worth at Bill Harvey Stadium.\nThe District 10-8A victory by the Chiefs (3-3, 1-2) puts the Trojans (4-2, 1-2) on the verge of postseason elimination and closed the gap on the seven-year rivalry to 4-3 in favor of the Trojans.\n\"This is a big rivalry game that both teams fought hard down to the wire in,\" Santaluces coach Jason Bradley said. \"We're already eliminated, and now we're trying to take everybody out with us. Anytime it's a rival, it's that much sweeter.\"\nComplete coverage package: Palm Beach high school football, week 6 Read more stories With the last three games decided by one, two and three points, it was only fitting this one was decided by four.\nThe Chiefsâ€™ stingy defense, led by Zach McCloud, was responsible for seven sacks, two interceptions, four batted passes and held the home team to just 88 yards.\n\"We had a really tough time offensively out there,\" Trojans coach Jesse Hester said. \"We were in trouble most of the night. Defensively, we played a heck of a ballgame to hold them to just seven points, but we weren't able to answer the bell offensively.\"\nThe Trojans moved the ball with ease on first drive behind the shifty running of senior tailback Terrik Wright who averaged eight yards a carry on the opening possession. But four penalties for 21 yards stalled the drive, leaving senior kicker Edgar Reyes to bail them out with a 40-yard field goal.\nThe three-point lead seemed on its way to holding up, until Westmoreland carried Trojan defenders with him across the goal line.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560f37e7/turbine/sfl-complete-coverage-package-palm-beach-high-school-football-week-6-20151002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560f3e26/turbine/fl-santaluces-lake-worth-recap-1003-20151002"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:42:57.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
