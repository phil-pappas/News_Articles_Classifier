The plants were anchored to the lake bottom with a chicken wire blanket and rocks. \nThis is the second year of a three-year effort to establish water willow in West Point. \nFunding for this effort came from a competitive grant written by Tony Beck. Beck is a fisheries biologist with WRD, serving at the Social Circle Hatchery, and he is also the president of a local bass club in Madison. BASS and Shimano provided $5,000 for the program. \nWater willow creates excellent shallow structure and cover — two things important to fish that are absent from many flood-control lakes drawn down during the winter. \nAccording to Beck, 15 of the 20 sites planted last year are now thriving. The hope is that, once established at key locations in West Point, the plant will naturally spread and colonize suitable habitat lake-wide. These young bass anglers will be fishing these grassbeds for decades. \nAlready, some sites planted last year are large enough to hold bass. \nOnlineAthens.com aims to foster constructive, respectful civic conversation.
