Tear down one home and replace it with two.\nThat means the proposed tax -- which heads to the City Council for consideration at 2 p.m. Wednesday -- would really only hit developers who tear down one home and replace it with one home.\nHow frequently does that happen?\nHales' office previously said there were 181 demolitions in 2014 on properties zoned for single family housing (R2.5 to R20). We've asked for stats on how many of those were one-for-one replacements.\nIn the meantime, we stumbled across some useful numbers and graphics from the Bureau of Development Services.\nHere are three key takeaways:\nDemolitions happened most frequently on properties with R5 zoning. City of Portland Between 2009 and 2013, the majority of demolitions occurred in neighborhoods with R5 zoning , where lot sizes can vary from 3,000 to 8,500 square feet . Total demolitions in the zone totaled nearly 350 -- about 300 more than the next highest zone. R5 zoning typically features a 50-foot by 100-foot lot. Demolitions in 2013 gave way to slightly more one-for-one replacements compared to infill projects. There were 121 or 122 one-for-one demolitions, according to city stats (which show both figures). There were 104 or 115 demolitions that led to two houses or more (again, the figures don't match). The typical demolished home registered at 1,119 square feet and was replaced by a home that's 2,075 feet , according to data from 1996 through 2011. The vast majority of demolitions targeted homes built from 1912 to 1964. -- Brad Schmidt\nbschmidt@oregonian.com\n503-294-7628\n@cityhallwatch", "external_links": ["https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bds/article/494613", "https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bds/article/494611", "https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bps/article/64609"], "published": "2015-10-12T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:06:33.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
