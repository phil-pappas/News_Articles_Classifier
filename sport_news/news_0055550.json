The Dansville Lady Mustangs found that out on Tuesday (Oct. 13) afternoon when Bath's Mackenzie Smith returned after playing all fall for the the USA Soccer National 19U Soccer team in California. The exceptional senior stand-out left the team a couple of weeks into the season and was slated to return for the Lady Rams final game of the regular season and the sectionals. The Rams struggled without her severely...especially seeing that coach Jessica VanScoter had only two subs on the bench without her. Dansville had to be the \"lucky\" one to be the opponent upon \"Mack's\" return. Dansville coach Arin Belden noted, \"the game was 0-0 about 15 minutes into the first half before they put Mackenzie Smith into the game.\" After that she would get 2 goals and an assist and they had a 3-0 lead at the half. Basically it ended up being 'Mackenzie Smith 5 and Dansville 0' as she scored 2 more goals in the second half as well! Smith is unquestionably an \"impact\" player as just after coming into the game, things started to happen. Bath would score those 3 first half goals in a 6 minute span. Smith scored in the 25th and 29th minutes both from Kambree Calkins and then assisted on Madelyn Czajkowski's goal in the 31st minute. In the 2nd half Smith's goals came 7 minutes in & in the 13th minute as Alex Siebert and Maia Schelecter assisted respectively on the plays. Bath (5-10-1) only out-shot Dansville 8-3 in the game.
