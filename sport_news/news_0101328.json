The ethics committee tribunal was also to decide whether to take action against UEFA leader Michael Platini and former FIFA vice president Chung Mong-Joon, both candidates to take over from Blatter. As the drama intensified, British media reported that the ethics committee had recommended a provisional suspension of 90 days for Blatter. But a close associate of the besieged FIFA chief dismissed the claims. “I was with president Blatter 30 minutes ago and no information of this kind was communicated to us,” said the associate, while a spokesman for the committee tribunal refused to comment. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:13:21.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
