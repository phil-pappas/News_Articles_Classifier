(AP Photo/LM Otero) \nTexas plays its first AL division series game since 2011 on Thursday at Toronto.\nA year after their 95 losses were the most in the American League, two months after they were still eight games out of first place and three days after ensuring themselves a post-season spot, the Rangers wrapped up their sixth division title.\n\"This means a lot. I have never been on a team with as much heart,\" said Elvis Andrus, the Rangers' most-tenured position player and a member of their only World Series teams in 2010 and 2011. \"This means a lot more than what we did a few years ago because of who these guys are. They have so much passion and energy. It has been a crazy year.\"\nMoments after the final out, AL West championship banners already were flying at the ballpark. The Rangers will go there under first-year manager Jeff Banister, whose team lost ace Yu Darvish to Tommy John surgery before the season started.\n\"Incredible moment, emotional, one I'll never forget,\" Banister said standing in a corner of the clubhouse while players celebrated as champagne sprayed all over the plays. \"They never quit.\"\nThe Angels needed to win their finale and have Houston lose in Arizona to force a tiebreaker game for the AL's second wild card. The Astros, who were playing in Arizona, clinched that wild card when the Angels lost.\nThe Rangers clinched no worse than a wild card with their 5-3 win in the opener of the four-game series Thursday night before the Angels, the 2014 division champs, won the next two games with ninth-inning rallies.\nLos Angeles won 2-1 on Friday and rallied for an 11-10 victory Saturday to stay in the race. Houston won both of those nights.\nTexas has won its last 10 games started by Hamels, the ace left-hander they acquired from Philadelphia at the end of July when he was coming off a no-hitter. Hamels won seven of those games â€” the 2008 World Series MVP is 7-1 with Texas and 13-8 overall this season.\nThe Rangers were eight games out of first place after an 11-inning loss to San Francisco on Aug. 1, when Hamels left with a three-run lead in the eighth inning of his Rangers debut.\nAt that time, many viewed the acquisition of Hamels, who is signed through 2018 with a club option for 2019, as a move for future seasons. Instead, the Rangers had him on the mound in the 162nd game of the season with a division title, and the seventh playoff berth in team history, in reach.\nAfter Albert Pujols hit his 40th homer in the first to give the Angels a 2-0 lead, following Mike Trout's double, Hamels allowed only one more hit. That was a one-out double in the second by Shane Victorino.\nTexas went ahead to stay in the fifth on Beltre's 18th homer, which landed just beyond the wall in right field for a 3-2 lead against Garrett Richards (15-12). That came after Shin-Soo Choo, who has reached base in 53 of the last 55 games, had an infield single.\nBeltre added an infield RBI single as the Rangers added six runs in the seventh, a 37-minute half-inning when Los Angeles used five pitchers.\nBeltre has 33 RBIs in his last 23 games, and an MLB-high 53 RBIs in 48 games since Aug. 15. He has 83 RBIs overall.\nRichards, starting on three days' rest for the first time in his career, walked the first two batters he faced before Fielder went the opposite way, pushing a grounder through the left side of the infield for an RBI single.\nUP NEXT\nRangers: A day off Monday before working out at home Tuesday and then travelling to Toronto for Game 1 of the ALDS.\nRANGERS IN POSTSEASON\nAfter winning AL West titles in 1996, 1998 and 1999, the Rangers lost each time in the division series to the New York Yankees. The Rangers won their other division titles in 2010 and 2011 and both times went to the World Series. Texas lost the first one-and-done AL wild-card game at home in 2012, then missed the playoffs the following season after losing a wild card tiebreaker.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:23:49.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
