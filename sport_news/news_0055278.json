Cardale Jones threw away a scoring chance when he was picked off inside the Hoosiers 15-yard line. The Buckeyes had eight major penalties, the offense couldn't score touchdowns in the red zone, and their normally stout defense couldn't put it away.\nBut Elliott rallied everyone.\nChris 'The Juice' Juszkiewicz runs loose as LaPorte downs Crown Point Brandon Vickrey Running backs have become a seemingly renewable resource for LaPorte football coach Dave Sharpe.\nWhen all-time leading rusher Charles Salary graduated after last season, the Slicers had Dion Williams in line to succeed him. When Williams went down with an ankle injury, Chris Juszkiewicz was waiting.\n... Running backs have become a seemingly renewable resource for LaPorte football coach Dave Sharpe.\nWhen all-time leading rusher Charles Salary graduated after last season, the Slicers had Dion Williams in line to succeed him. When Williams went down with an ankle injury, Chris Juszkiewicz was waiting.\n... (Brandon Vickrey) His first two scoring runs erased Indiana leads and his third appeared to give the Buckeyes a seemingly safe 34-20 lead early in the fourth quarter.\nThe Buckeyes extended their Big Ten regular-season winning streak to 25, barely, and will now wait to see if they can match Oklahoma's record for most weeks (101) at No. 1 in The Associated Press poll.\n\"Coach Meyer made an emphasis that big plays are going to spark the team, and I knew we needed big plays,\" Elliott said after his 10th straight 100-yard game. \"The O-line did a great job blocking and they made it easy for me.\"\nIt was a game full or surprises.\nIndiana (4-1, 0-1) gambled twice on fourth down in the first half — including a fake punt from its 16-yard line that failed. Elliott turned the game open with the 65-yard run on fourth-and-1 from in the third quarter.\nThe teams combined for four scoring runs — three from Elliott — that went for more than 50 yards during a 13-minute stretch in the second half.\nIndiana stymied by injuries, Ohio State in battle of Big Ten unbeatens Chris Russell / TNS Ohio State safety Tyvis Powell, 23, stops Indiana quarterback Zander Diamont, 12, after a reception on a fourth-quarter trick play at Memorial Stadium in Bloomington, Ind., on Saturday.

(Chris Russell / TNS) Meyer was more concerned with the mistakes.\n\"We're turning the ball over at an alarming rate, and that's obviously the difference in the game and sometime that's going to come back and at some point that's going to bite you,\" Meyer said. \"We've got to fix that.\"\nOhio State also lost receiver Corey Smith, who was carted off the field with what appeared to be a lower right leg injury.\nThe Hoosiers, who have not beaten the Buckeyes since 1988, made life miserable despite losing the nation's top rusher, Jordan Howard, in the first half, and starting quarterback, Nate Sudfeld, in the third quarter. Both had left ankle injuries.\nHoward tried to return but couldn't cut on the leg. Sudfeld lobbied to return late but coach Kevin Wilson wouldn't let him.\n\"I just didn't feel he (Sudfeld) was as mobile and we were in a one possession game and I felt like we could work it,\" Wilson said. \"We go down first-and-goal and give ourselves a chance, so I mean we played it right.\"\nSo did Elliott.\nHe wiped out a 10-6 halftime deficit with the 55-yard run, a 17-13 deficit with the 65-yard run and appeared to have sealed it when his 75-yarder made it 34-20.\nBut Indiana backup quarterback Zander Diamont beat the Buckeyes on a 79-yard run to make it 34-27 with 10:03 left in the game.\nDiamont drove the Hoosiers to the Ohio State 6 in the final minute, and scrambled on third-and-goal from the 10, throwing a pass to the back corner of the end zone.\nApple batted it away.\nDiamont led the Hoosiers with 98 yards on seven carries and Howard finished with 34 yards on 14 carries.\n\"That's a really good football team, very good, they're the No. 1 team in the country, they've won a boatload of games in a row and they're good,\" Wilson said. \"We've got to keep moving forward.\"\nCopyright © 2015, Post-Tribune Ohio State Buckeyes Indiana Hoosiers Big Ten Urban Meyer Sports", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561086f1/turbine/ct-ptb-football-ohio-state-indiana--jpg-20151003", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560f4a00/turbine/ct-ptb-football-laporte-crown-point-st-1003-20151002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5610b0dd/turbine/ct-ptb-football-ohio-state-indiana-st-1004-20151003"], "published": "2015-10-04T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T09:27:42.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
