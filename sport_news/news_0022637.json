My point (to the players) very simply has been that rankings come and go. Our focus should be to be ranked at the end of the year. East Carolina's a dangerous team. I did talk (to them) about (being ranked), only because I know they're hearing it. I don't want to put my head in the sand. I'm trying to set the proper tone on how we should look at it.\" \nFor the fourth time in program history, they've won their first six. They've never started 7-0. \nThe Owls were touchdown underdogs in their first two games, against Penn State at home and Cincinnati on the road. They won those by 17 and eight, respectively. \nTemple has played seven times when it's been ranked. It's won four. But that was a long time ago. This is mostly new ground to many. Especially for a team that went 2-10 in Rhule's 2013 debut. \nThat seems like a long time ago too. \n\"I mean, being 6-0 is way better than being 0-5,\" Rhule said. \"I've been 0-5. That's pressure. Six and 0 is just a number. I really just care about the way we play. I wasn't happy with the way we played, in a lot of ways, last week (30-16 comeback win against 0-7 Central Florida in South Philly). We have a lot to get corrected. \n\"We won't win (for) too long if we (don't).\" \nLast November, ECU came here ranked 21st and lost in the rain to the 4-3 Owls by 10. It's something both teams figure to remember. \n\"I'm proud of what we've done,\" Rhule said. \"But if (being ranked now is) the highlight, then it won't be the season we wanted. The future is today. We're a pretty focused group. So we're not really enjoying too much of anything right now. That's the challenge. We're kind of going at it full bore, especially with a short week (to prepare).\" \nNotre Dame awaits. For many, that can't get here soon enough. Hence the danger. \nOn Twitter: @mikekerndn", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:39:21.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
