Peter Shumlin says a substantial software upgrade to Vermont's health exchange met his self-imposed deadline Thursday.\nThe patch will be installed Thursday night as administrators take the website offline. They say when it boots back up Monday, the exchange should essentially be ready to automate re-enrollment, which begins in November.\nAdministrators say they may still need to make tweaks, but they have plenty of time to do so before November.\nSetbacks have plagued the exchange since its launch two years ago.\nShumlin says Vermonters won't get a chance to test the new functionality until November, which he calls the real test.\n\"I want to make clear that today is not a mission accomplished. It's an update on extraordinarily optimistic-- that we're very optimistic that on November first this exchange is going to work as we all wished it would have,\" said Shumlin, D-Vermont.\nOur Kyle Midura will have much more on this story tonight on the Channel 3 News at 6 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:59:45.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
