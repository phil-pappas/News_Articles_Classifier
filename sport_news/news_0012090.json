Well, the internet still seems to be caring about her for some reason, and none of us can seem to figure out why. There happened to be a lot of searches for her lately, and Tweets about her despite the fact that she didn’t actually do anything. \nAt least nothing more than she ever does. (which is nothing) \nThe point is why is anyone still talking about her? (Actually, why am I even devoting a whole post to someone who’s only claim to fame is being desperate to attract publicity) \nAmy Willliams is so 2011; or 2010 or 20….D ’T C R \nI didn’t care about Front Row Amy then, and I sure as hell don’t care about her now. \nWith Front Row Amy, there is no there. Period. End of story. \nSo just go away already. Please, just leave. \n  writes   Fox Sports Digital.
