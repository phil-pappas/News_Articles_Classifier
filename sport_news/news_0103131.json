It’s no big deal where I play, it’s how I play,” Jones, who is attempting to crack the Celtics roster this preseason, said before yesterday’s practice. “I consider myself as just a player. Whatever people label me as, that’s what they label me as.”\nRight now, though, the issue is also when he’ll play. After playing seven minutes in the team’s exhibition opener in Milan, and missing the next game in Madrid after returning home from Italy to attend the funeral of a cousin, he played nine minutes last Wednesday against the Brooklyn Nets and never left the bench Friday against the New York Knicks.\n“That was just (Friday night),” coach Brad Stevens said. “I played Perry a lot early on. I just wanted James ( Young ) to get a few more minutes. Perry will play this upcoming week.”\nBut as the 16th player with a guaranteed contract added to the maximum 15-contract mix, Jones has roughly a week to win a roster spot.\n“Always keep the faith. That’s part of basketball,” Jones said. “I can’t tell you why I didn’t see the floor, that’s a question for Brad, but I just have to stay ready for the next game.”\nJones has admittedly been in flux. He was deeply hurt by the death of his cousin.\n“Apart from family issues back home it’s been an OK camp, fighting through the everyday battles for me,” he said. “Just put that on the side and compete and play. Earn a spot on the team, possibly the rotation, it’s an everyday thing.”\nSmart, Rozier practice\nMarcus Smart , having recovered from a strep throat, and rookie Terry Rozier , his bruised left knee also mended, returned to practice.\nOne reason rookie R.J. Hunter finished the Knicks game at point guard was the result of the two above playmakers being unavailable. It could have been an important week for Rozier, especially.\n“That’s one reason I wish Terry hadn’t been out while Marcus was sick, because he would have played a boatload of minutes the last two games,” Stevens said. “He has to get healthy, and instead of bringing him back at 90 percent, we’re bringing him back 100-percent healthy. Hopefully he’ll play a lot this week as we get into the final week of the exhibition season.”\nCoach draws praise\nStevens’ reputation as one of the league’s finest X’s and O’s men continues to grow, now with newcomer Amir Johnson marveling at the coach’s in-game skills.\n“He’s a great X’s and O’s coach,” Johnson said. “He can draw up a play in a heartbeat. It’s something he does when he sees how a defense is set up, and he knows how to draw up a play that breaks down the defense. Not a lot of coaches know how to do that, and he does it on the fly, which is what I love about him.”\nThe power forward also saw another side of Stevens on Friday night, after the coach was whistled for a rare technical foul (second of his NBA career) for protesting a non-call on center Tyler Zeller . Referee Ron Garretson told Stevens that he drew the whistle by stepping on the floor.\nStevens, as Johnson observed, was also very angry.\n“In particular (Friday night), when he almost killed the ref on the floor and got a tech,” Johnson said. “I haven’t seen him get rowdy, and I kind of like that. He doesn’t show that very often, but on the floor you see the veins go up (in his neck). I had his back, too.” . . .\nStevens was unaware that Floyd Mayweather Jr. was attempting to get his attention at halftime Friday night. According to the boxer’s good friend, C’s guard Isaiah Thomas , Mayweather wanted to offer Stevens some coaching advice.\nStevens shrugged.\n“A lot of people in the building want to give me advice,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:21:23.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
