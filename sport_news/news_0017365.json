In addition to a new interface, the app is designed to be more intuitive than previous versions. \nThe update includes new design elements as well as new contact forms with more nuanced information, a more secure inbox, search filters, an undo-button, the death of passwords, and the ability to access multiple email clients through the Yahoo Mail app. The updates are rolling out across desktop and mobile starting today. Multiple mailboxes \nPerhaps the biggest update is that Yahoo Mail will now let you access email from other account providers through the Yahoo Mail app. Users will now be able to connect mail accounts from Outlook.com, Hotmail and AOL to Yahoo Mail. But not Gmail, which may be a bummer for a lot of people . Think of this feature as an answer to Apple’s iOS mail client. \nWith Multiple Mailboxes, users will be able to search across all email boxes at once. An end to Passwords \nYahoo vice president of product Dylan Casey says that passwords and even security questions are an antiquated solution for protecting Web users. From VentureBeat Your marketing strategy called. It needs a better mobile game plan. Free webinar will tell you how. \n“We built a system that’s entirely complex, outdated, and doesn’t actually protect the user,” says Casey off the Webs dominate security protocol. \nTo rectify that broken authentication system, Yahoo is killing off passwords in its latest release. Through a new feature called Account Key, users can choose to prove their identity by way of a push notification sent to their phone. The notification ask users if they’re trying to log into their account. Pressing ‘yes’ allows access to the account, pressing ‘non’ denies it. \nThis new feature builds on a product the company release earlier this year called on-demand passwords , a two-factor authentication like experience where Yahoo emails a new password to your phone. Avatars \nEarlier this year Yahoo announced that it would hook into Twitter, Facebook, and Linkedin to help to help flesh out Mail contacts and make them more relevant. This has led to the use of avatars to identify senders. \nThe avatars are also a security provision. Yahoo Mail only delivers mail from “authorized senders” or those that stand up to the Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance authentication policy. That means less spam and less malware in your inbox. \nHooking into social sites means more contextual data about your contacts. Yahoo Mail says with this data it can determine whether the person contacting you is a “top contact” and inputs the senders other contact details into a main contact card. The contact card also contains information about your email history with that person as well as stats, like how many emails you’ve exchanged. It also makes recommendations for other people who may be related to your contact like friends or colleagues. Yahoo senior director of product Fernando Delgado says this feature is especially helpful if you can’t remember where you met someone. \nYahoo Mail’s heavy use of data also helps it to make recommendations on who you should add to an email chain. An undo button \nYahoo Mail now has an undo button for returning emails you accidentally deleted. After you delete an email a button will appear at the bottom of the screen asking if you want to undo your last action. Though a simple addition, it’s a much nicer experience to bring deleted emails back to your inbox with the touch of button rather than having to pull them from your trash box. You can undo other actions to, like if you accidentally move an email to another folder or mark it unread. Filters \nYahoo Mail now has added filters for sifting through emails. The app lets you filter emails based on whether you’re looking for something you sent or received and also lets you search for images and documents. You can also search within a contact card for all the images or documents that a given person has sent you. \nThe real power of this tool is finding older content, like photos from that trip to Paris you took three years ago. Yahoo Mail also keeps a record of your query history, so if you’ve searched for something before, it will auto-populate the search field as you type it. iOS + Android \nYahoo made some slight tweaks to the app to optimize it for each operating system. For instance on Android the Yahoo Mail app uses Google’s Material Design. The Android version lays out emails in a “conversation” format, so multiple email exchanges appear cleaner. \nOn iOS, when you search from the phone’s search bar for a contact, it will surface relevant Yahoo Mail emails. The company also said there are some special shortcuts for iOS 9, but didn’t go into details. \nFor the most part the apps offer a mostly similar experience. On both iOS and Android, a swipe left on both interfaces with return you to the screen you were on before, for example. Overall \nThis is a pretty big update for Yahoo, one that directly challenges Google’s Mail client. Yahoo is trying to make its email client increasingly relevant to users by incorporating news feeds and social data , hopefully drawing them away from Google. Last year the company rolled out travel and event notifications , in which Yahoo Mail pulls relevant details from your email to let you know you’re supposed to be somewhere. \nAll this to say, it’s clear Yahoo is trying to find more ways to keep its customers within its own ecosystem.
