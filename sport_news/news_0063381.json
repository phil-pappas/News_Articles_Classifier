With Jacob deGrom taking the ball in Game 3 at Wrigley Field, everything seems to be aligning for the Mets -- including a few surprises.\nPOLITI : Mets' David Wright proves that he won't 'suck' forever in this NLCS\nHere are the five biggest surprises about the Mets so far this postseason:\n1. Daniel Murphy is the new Mr. October\nMurphy has become one of the breakout stars of the postseason after crushing his fifth home run of the playoffs on Sunday -- a two-run shot to right off Cubs ace Jake Arrieta in the first inning. The other pitchers he's homered off of? Clayton Kershaw (twice), Zack Greinke and Jon Lester.\nMurphy has now hit a homer in four consecutive postseason games and has eight RBI while going 10-for-28 over seven playoff games.\n\"I think as a teammate and as a hitter very rarely do you see somebody get this hot against average pitching,\" David Wright said . \"Then you throw in that it's Kershaw, Greinke twice each, Lester, Arrieta, I mean, that's impressive. I said it after the Dodgers series, he's about as locked in as I've seen a hitter, and he's carried that out now for, what's it been, seven games. That's quite a feat, especially in the playoffs against this pitching.\"\n2. The Mets beat the NL Cy Young triumvirate of Clayton Kershaw, Zack Greinke and Arrieta\nThe Mets had to face Kershaw and Greinke four out of five times during their NLDS versus the Dodgers and still found a way to win the series. After beating Arrieta on Sunday, the Mets have essentially defeated the three best pitchers in the National League this season.\n\"We feel like we can beat anyone at any given point,\" Travis d'Arnaud said.\n3. The bullpen is providing solid middle relief\nDespite having a dominant closer, there were some questions about the reliability of the Mets' bullpen in middle relief, especially since Addison Reed and Tyler Clippard struggled down the stretch. But the addition of Bartolo Colon as the long man has made a big difference, and the bullpen provided 3 1/3 innings of scoreless relief on Sunday after Noah Syndergaard was lifted with two outs in the sixth inning.\nJon Niese was brought in to face lefty bat Anthony Rizzo and struck him out swinging to get out of the inning. Reed and Clippard followed in the seventh and eighth innings, respectively, serving as a bridge to Jeurys Familia, who converted his fourth save of the postseason to seal the Mets' 4-1 win.\n\"Everybody's playing to win and rooting for each other,\" manager Terry Collins said. \"They don't care who is in the game, just get it done. When they get their opportunity, they're ready, because they want to be part of it.\"\n4. Curtis Granderson is a catalyst\nGranderson, the Mets' most consistent hitter during the regular season, has continued to be a steady force in the playoffs, where he's batting .375 (9-for-24) in the leadoff spot.\nGranderson was instrumental in helping the Mets generate some runs on Sunday against Arrieta, as he hit a leadoff single to start the game and then scored on David Wright's RBI double to center. In the third, Granderson drew a walk to open the inning and then stole second and third before scoring on Yoenis Cespedes' RBI infield single to give the Mets a 4-0 lead. Oh, and he also robbed Chris Coghlan of a home run with a fantastic leaping catch in right field.\n\"He's just been, I'd say, our steadiest player all year, consistent every single day,\" Murphy said. \"He's had a great year, and he's swinging the bat really well right now. That was a cool catch he made. That was fun.\"\n5. Terry Collins is making all the right moves\nCollins is managing in the playoffs for the first time in his career at 66, yet he continues to push all the right buttons. Some of his late-inning moves have been risky, such as bringing in Familia for a six-out save in Game 5 of the NLDS, but they've all seemed to work out so far.\nHe's also received praise for his ability to keep the clubhouse loose and communicate well with his players.\n\"In recent years I think I spend more time in conversations with my players than I ever have before,\" Collins said. \"The players know they have a voice that they can come in my office at any time. I have no ego. I wasn't a star player. I don't have to worry about I don't get caught up in headlines. I get caught up in go have fun playing.\"\nMaria Guardado may be reached at mguardado@njadvancemedia.com . Follow her on Twitter @mi_guardado .
