RUSSO The Associated Press \nCalifornia at Utah is more important to the College Football Playoff race than Miami at Florida State. \nThis is where we are in college football this season. \nESPN is bringing \"College GameDay\" to Salt Lake City on Saturday for a showdown of the only remaining undefeated teams in the Pac-12 that few people would have predicted. \nNo. 23 Cal and quarterback Jared Goff are 5-0 for the first time since 2007. The No. 5 Utes (5-0) are getting touted as the top team in the country. Neither team was ranked in preseason. \n\"We're viewing this as a good opportunity to go in the national spotlight and make a statement,\" Cal receiver Bryce Treggs said. \nThe other marquee matchup of ranked teams this weekend will be played in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where the 18th-ranked Wolverines (4-1) play surprising No. 13 Northwestern (5-0). Who knew? \nMeanwhile, the Hurricanes and Seminoles are playing with far less fanfare in Tallahassee. It's still a big game, of course. Florida State has not been particularly impressive, but still has to be considered one of the favorites in the Atlantic Coast Conference. The story in Miami has been more focused on coach Al Golden's future than whether the 'Canes can contend in the ACC Coastal. \nThe other juicy rivalry that doesn't have quite the same pop this season is Texas-Oklahoma. The Red River rivals get together for their annual Cotton Bowl date during the Texas State Fair. It's been a tough go for Charlie Strong's Longhorns (1-4) so far, but there is historical precedent for struggling Texas teams beating good Oklahoma teams. Texas is 5-2 in the Red River Rivalry since 1989 when it is unranked and the Sooners are ranked. Though this could be a historically bad Texas team. The Longhorns haven't started this poorly since 1956, when they finished 1-9. \nOn a weekend when upsets could be the big story, Texas will try to pull one of the biggest. \nThe picks: \nTHURSDAY NIGHT LIGHTS \nWashington (plus 16 1-2) at No. 17 Southern California \nTrojans QB Cody Kessler has thrown 54 TD passes and six interceptions since last season; the Huskies have allowed two TD passes this season ...
