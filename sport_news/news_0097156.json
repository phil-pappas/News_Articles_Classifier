(AP) - Candidates for Louisiana governor are crisscrossing the state and filling the airwaves with their final pitches, hoping to drum up interest from undecided voters for Saturday's election.\nNone of the four major contenders is expected to top 50 percent, so a Nov. 21 runoff will decide which man follows term-limited Bobby Jindal into office.\nRepublican U.S. Sen. David Vitter has campaigned as front-runner, but his poll numbers have slipped. Republican rivals - Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle and Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne - are trying to rally enough support to pass Vitter.\nDemocratic state Rep. John Bel Edwards appears to have locked up a runoff spot.\nSix other statewide races are also on the ballot, along with four constitutional amendments. Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Saturday.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
