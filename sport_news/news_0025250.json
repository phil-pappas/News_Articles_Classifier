Browns coach Mike Pettine said McCown is sore, but the 36-year-old will \"be out there\" at practice Wednesday as the Browns prepare to host the Denver Broncos, who have the NFL's top-ranked defense. \nPettine said the Browns may scale back McCown's number of snaps in practice. \nMcCown passed for a franchise regular-season record 457 yards and two touchdowns in Cleveland's 33-30 win. He also ran for a score, threw for a 2-point conversion and helped Cleveland win in Baltimore for the first time since 2007. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:08:43.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
