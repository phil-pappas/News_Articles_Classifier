My teams must play at full throttle and take it to the limit every single game. \n\"It is important to have a playing philosophy that reflects your own mentality, reflects the club and gives you a clear direction to follow. Tactical of course, but tactical with a big heart. \n\"Liverpool has extraordinary supporters and Anfield is a world renowned home, with an incredible atmosphere. I want to build a great relationship with these supporters and give them memories to cherish.\" \nKlopp has been joined at Liverpool by Zeljko Buvac and Peter Krawietz, his former assistants at Dortmund. \n\"In Juergen Klopp we have appointed a world-class manager with a proven track record of winning and someone who has the personality and charisma to reignite this football club and take the team forward,\" Liverpool chairman Tom Werner said. \n\"He is a strong, inspirational leader, who has a clear philosophy of high energy, attacking football. Critically, he is also a winner and someone who can connect with and enthuse our supporters,\" Werner added. \nBURDEN OF HISTORY \nIn an impressive first news conference later on Friday, Klopp told a packed audience at Anfield that he wanted a positive approach on and off the pitch, to \"turn doubters into believers\". \nWell aware that Liverpool have not won the league for 25 years, the new man said he did not want history to become a burden and that he was not prepared to promise immediate success. \n\"History is only the base for us. You can't carry it in your backpack every day. Five or six clubs in the Premier League can win the league. It’s a problem.\" \nLooking relaxed after a four-month break, he insisted that working as part of the club's much-criticised transfer committee would not be a problem and that he would have the final say. \nBritish media reports put the value of Klopp's contract at a basic 5 million pounds per year, with bonuses taking that to a potential 7 million. \nFor that he said, they are getting \"a totally normal guy\". \n\"It’s not normal club, it’s a special club. I'm the normal one.\" \nHis final message was a request for patience. \n\"Please give us time to work on it. Please be patient. I don't say we have to wait 20 years. In four years time I'm pretty sure we will have won a title. If not, Switzerland!\" \n(Reporting by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru and Steve Tongue in London; editing by Amlan Chakraborty ) \nOur top photos from the past 24 hours.
