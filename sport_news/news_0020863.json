(Chris Young/The Canadian Press ... more > By The Associated Press   \nThe latest on the League Championship Series. The Blue Jays and Royals play Game 2 in Kansas City with a first pitch set for 4:07 p.m. The Cubs and Mets play the opener of the NL best-of-seven at 8:07 p.m. Here’s a look at what’s happening (all times EDT): \n___ \n4:25 p.m. \nShadows are pretty severe in front of the mound at Kauffman Stadium in the first inning of Game 2 of the ALCS with the late afternoon start. It’s going to make for some tough at-bat for hitters against the Royals’ hard-throwing Yordano Ventura and Blue Jays’ David Price. \nVentura reached 99 mph in a perfect first. \n4:17 p.m. \nRookie Noah Syndergaard will start for the New York Mets in Game 2 of the NL Championship Series against the Chicago Cubs on Sunday night. \nSyndergaard threw 17 pitches in the seventh inning Thursday against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the final game of the NL Division Series, the first relief appearance of his big league career, and warmed up four times before coming in. \nNew York manager Terry Collins waited until Saturday to announce his decision, wanting to make sure Syndergaard was not sore. \nCollins said rookie left-hander Steven Matz, his Game 4 starter, will be available out of the bullpen this weekend. \nJacob deGrom, who won twice in the Division Series, is set to start Game 3. \n4 p.m. \nSuper-fan and Hall of Fame golfer Tom Watson, dressed in a Royals jacket, threw out the ceremonial first pitch before Kansas City played Toronto in Game 2 of the ALCS. \nIt was a strike because, well, everything thrown by anyone in Royals gear these days seems to be a strike. They entered the game on a franchise-record 16-inning scoreless streak. \nIt began with a superb outing by Johnny Cueto in the winner-take-all Game 5 of their Divisional Series against Houston, and continued with a 5-0 victory over the Blue Jays on Friday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:07:39.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
