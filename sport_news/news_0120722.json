Then again, given what the Canadiens are, and what they’ve become again — a scourge — they may be the last team the Bruins want to see at this point. In the end, it doesn’t matter. The Canadiens visit TD Garden on Saturday night, where the B’s will try to right what went wrong in Thursday’s 6-2, opening night loss to the Jets — a team not regarded quite as highly as the Habs. “It’s always nice to get the first win,” said Loui Eriksson, a minus-2 in Thursday’s loss, “but it’s going to be tough. That’s a good team we’re going to play against.” There’s no denying that. The Canadiens, No. 1 in the Atlantic Division and No. 2 in the NHL last season with 110 points, come to Boston after opening the season with a 3-1 victory at Toronto. The Habs have also, after a brief respite, restored themselves as a major thorn in the Bruins’ side. After recovering from a 3-2 series deficit to upset and oust the Presidents Trophy winners in a seven-game, second-round playoff series in 2014, the Canadiens swept last season’s series over the B’s, 4-0. Normally, that would be Saturday night’s rallying cry. Instead, the NHL’s oldest (729 regular-season games, plus another 177 over 34 playoff series) and perhaps fiercest rivalry is almost a footnote, given the way the Bruins fell to the Jets. “It’s a big bounce-back game for us. It just happens to be Montreal,” said Jimmy Hayes, whose debut as a Bruin was spoiled as he and linemates Ryan Spooner and Brett Connolly were on the ice for two Winnipeg goals. “No matter who we were playing, it was going to be a big game for us, to get us going on the right foot.” “Our character is going to have to shine,” said winger Zac Rinaldo. While Hayes, a Dorchester native and Boston College product, grew up close enough to witness the Bruins-Habs rivalry in person, other newcomers to the team have only seen or heard of it — a lot — from afar. Naturally, they’re intrigued. “I’ve heard tons about it,” said winger Matt Beleskey. “I’m excited to see what it’s like.” “I’ve played against them enough to know the importance of just playing against the Canadiens in general,” Rinaldo said. “But these guys (the Bruins), and their rivalry against the Canadiens — everyone gets amped up, everyone maybe gives that little extra.” One of the Bruins’ prevailing morning-after sentiments on Friday was that if they’d given a little extra on the offensive end against Winnipeg, they, too, might be 1-0-0 entering Saturday’s matchup. Instead, their failure to convert several outstanding scoring chances after David Krejci gave them a 1-0 lead in the first period let the Jets stay close. As the visitors began to press, the Bruins lapsed into a loose, mistake-filled stretch marked by questionable puck management and poor defensive coverage. “We should have probably scored more goals, and it would have been a different game,” Eriksson said. “But [the Jets] did a good job to come back in the second [three goals] and we made a lot of mistakes.” Friday’s practice at Ristuccia Arena indicated that coach Claude Julien had resisted any temptation to juggle his lineup immediately. He may yet change it by Saturday night, though. Injured captain Zdeno Chara, who sat out the opener with an upper body injury, practiced again on Friday, the fourth straight day he participated in drills with the team. “It’s always hard to watch and not play, no matter what,” said Chara, who was injured in a Sept. 24 preseason game. “As of right now, I’m honestly just waiting for (Saturday). I don’t want to have any setbacks, (but) if it keeps going like this, I’m pretty close.” By Mike Loftus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:30:36.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
