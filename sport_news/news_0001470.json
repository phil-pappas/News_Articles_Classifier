I have heard and read it several times. ‘Let go’, ‘forgive and forget’, ‘don’t live in the past’ are other very meaningful pieces of advice that we often hear, but earnestly dispense with. Let alone actually practising it, at times, I find it difficult even to pretend to follow it. How does a mortal go about following such wisdom? Ghalib, the master of words, puts it thus: Hui mudat ke Ghalib mar gaya par yaad aata hai Voh har ik baat pe kehna ke yoon hota to kya hota We all have some regrets. At least Ghalib did, and so do I. And I want to get rid of them. Regrets are many, some too simple, like about government schoolteachers who, on a whim, exercised their authority and ordered students to line up and be a murga, or when they would command the students to extend their hand for caning. It was not just the pain, but the bravado you had to keep; to fight back the tears, so you weren’t the subject of mockery for other students. A regret about not mustering the courage to show the door to relatives who, posing as sympathisers, thought it their right to give us unsolicited sermons about austerity and simplicity because we happened to have lost our father very early. This they did while relishing samosas and gulping tea my mother had served them from her hard-earned money. And then an elderly ‘sant’ father of one of my schoolmates, who often accused me of being a disobedient child. As an 11-year-old boy, I could not find the words to tell anyone what a pervert and thief he was. Regrets about not having expressed my feelings to my first love as a grown boy, nor responding to the subtle expressions of affection. Maybe, I held her too high in my esteem. And then, not pursuing my passion. Giving undue importance to financial security which, at this stage, I realise was really not a very big issue. Having been too sentimental and surrendering to the wishes of so many individuals around me. Another regret, this. It is not that all the decisions did not make sense, but succumbing to emotional blackmail in some very crucial moments often leaves one with a feeling of remorse. Now, talking about these — some unwritten — I try to figure out what to let go and whom to forgive. I have, of course, had my share of huge satisfaction of having confronted several challenging situations. Even surrender, by choice, has been satisfying. The “villains” did what they thought was right for themselves. The regret comes from my own expectations, inactions or not taking a stand for myself when it mattered. I think the one person I need to first forgive is, myself. PS: Going through all that has been put on paper, I feel relieved; kind of freedom from the baggage. I am already counting my blessings.
