Bush gave speeches after the players were treated to a perfectly choreographed ceremonial display for the first Presidents Cup to be held in Asia.\nAfter the unveiling of the golden trophy at the Songdo Convensia just a kilometer from the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club venue, Bush spoke to salute the long ties between the US and South Korea.\nBush noted that the teams were playing for pride, with all money generated donated to charity in the biennial event which has raised more than $32 million for good causes since its inception in 1994.\nEach of the 24 players nominates a charity to receive a portion of funds raised. Other speakers included golf legend Jack Nicklaus, who designed the course on which the players will battle over the next four days in what he called “the greatest sporting event.”\n“We have the world’s No. 1 and 2 in Jordan Spieth and Jason Day,” said Nicklaus, “and the first players from Thailand and India to play.”\nInternational team captain Nick Price said his team was “so excited to be in Asia for the first time.”\nAnd his opposite number on the US team Jay Haas thanked Park for her support in bringing the event to her country.\nBoth captains introduced their respective teams as animated caricature “avatars” of each player were displayed on a giant screen.\nThe Presidents Cup has been dominated by the US, which has only lost once in the 10 previous editions of the match play team event.\nPlay begins Thursday with five foursome matches and continues Friday with five fourballs. Saturday sees four more foursomes and fourball matches before reaching a climax Sunday with 12 singles.\nDanny Lee and Marc Leishman received the golfing equivalent of a ‘hospital pass’ Wednesday after the International duo were served up to America’s world No. 1 Jordan Spieth and big-hitting Dustin Johnson for the foursomes.\nThursday’s opening foursomes also sees the Internationals’ 2013 pairing of Adam Scott and Hideki Matsuyama reunited to face Bubba Watson and J.B. Holmes.\nSouth Africans Louis Oosthuizen and Branden Grace are up against Matt Kuchar and Patrick Reed and Asian pair Anirban Lahiri and Thongchai Jaidee play Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker.\nAustralian duo Jason Day and Steven Bowditch will take on Phil Mickelson and Zach Johnson. — Agencies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:36:39.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
