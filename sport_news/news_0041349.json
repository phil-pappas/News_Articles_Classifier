This will prepare the ground for an operation to cleanse Sinniya,\" he said.\nThe operation launched this week to secure Baiji, which has seen almost uninterrupted fighting since ISIS swept across Iraq's Sunni Arab heartland in June 2014, appears to be spearheaded by the Hashed.\nHadi al-Ameri, the most visible commander of the Hashed and a leading member of the Tehran-backed Shia militia Badr, has been omnipresent on the Baiji frontlines.\nQassem Soleimani, commander of the foreign wing of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards, was also reported in Iraqi media to have played a key role.\nThe US-led coalition, which is more active on the Anbar front, said Friday it had carried out two strikes in the Baiji area the previous day.\nIt also said it had destroyed parts of another refinery, in Qayyarah, between Baiji and main northern city Mosul, that \"was used by Daesh to produce oil for the black market to fund their terrorist activities\".\nAround Ramadi, which ISIS seized in mid-May, Iraqi forces pressed an offensive to retake it, with air support from the coalition.\nAccording to daily tallies provided by the US military, coalition warplanes have carried out at least 69 strikes against ISIS in the Ramadi area this month alone.\nMajor ground advances in recent days have allowed pro-government forces to almost completely encircle Ramadi, where the coalition estimates the number of remaining ISIS fighters to be between 600 and 1,000.\n\"We're encouraged by this progress, but much fighting lies ahead. Important for Iraq forces to keep moving forward,\" US military spokesman Patrick Ryder said on social media.\nIraqi forces were also tightening the noose around ISIS in the town of Baghdadi, further west up the Euphrates River in Anbar province.\nArmy Major General Ali Dabbun said his forces, with backing from local Sunni tribal fighters opposed to ISIS, had made good progress in Baghdadi.\n\"Our forces defused 62 IEDs (improvised explosive devices), blew up three rigged buildings, causing no victims,\" he said, claiming that many ISIS fighters had been killed in the latest fighting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:06:56.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
