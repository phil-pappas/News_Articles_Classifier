For Babcock, it’s the first time on the visiting side of Joe Louis Arena in 10 years and a dress rehearsal for Detroit’s season opener a week from now when the Leafs are once more in town. \n“We kind of laughed, because we know what Mike’s probably going to say when he brings the ref over, or talks to some of his players,” said Detroit left winger Justin Abdelkader after the morning skate. “It’s exciting, but you have to turn the page. Once we get through these pre-season games and then the opener, it will be second nature. It will be a new year, business as usual.” \nThat seems like the case already for the Red Wings as they replaced Babcock with who many see as his clone. Jeff Blashill, an assistant under Babcock for a year, took the job in Grand Rapids, instilled Babcock’s puck possession fundamentals in a group of kids who were not getting promoted until they were “over-ready” in Babcock’s opinion. Eventually, Blashill populated the Wings’ room with his Griffins’ graduates. \n“Same coach, same message,” said defenceman Xavier Ouellet. “He has his philosophies and his way of working and it’s fun to see he comes here talking the same: same practice, same plan, same everything. It will be good for the guys. The older veterans (Pavel Datsyuk, Henrik Zetterberg, Niklas Kronwall) haven’t seen him, but for more than half the team, they get it pretty quick.” \nBlashill has been getting as many questions here about the significance of facing Babcock as the latter has answered in Toronto. \n“I wouldn’t be standing here today if it wasn’t for Mike,” Blashill said. “Mike is someone I’ve learned a ton from. We had a special relationship and he is a good friend. But I’ve also coached against a lot of people I’ve worked with in the past. It’s our team against their team.” \nSome saw Babcock’s departure as a good thing in the sense it broke a long routine in Detroit. The Wings have made the playoffs with regularity under Babcock, but not advanced far. \n“I think it was time for us to get a new voice in the locker room,” said winger Johan Franzen. “And maybe it was time for him, too, to try something else.” \nDetroit had not lost in pre-season play prior to Friday (4-0) and some of their youngsters were among their top shooters. Dylan Larkin, Tomas Tatar and Nick Jensen, all scheduled to play Friday, have four points. \n“I’ve been put in situations where I’ve been on the top line or playing against others teams’ shutdown lines,” said the 19-year-old Larkin. “I was still able to put up some numbers. That feels good getting into the season.” \nDetroit lines tonight against the Leafs \nAbdelkader Zetterberg Nyquist", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:45:49.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
