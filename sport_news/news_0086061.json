(AP) - Titans rookie wide receiver Dorial Green-Beckham says he thought police gave him a warning only for speeding as he left a hospital following his son's birth in July and was surprised to learn of an outstanding warrant when stopped in Missouri during Tennessee's bye week.\nGreen-Beckham said Wednesday it was a misunderstanding because he had no idea a ticket had been issued.\nPolice in Van Buren, Missouri, stopped the rookie Sept. 30 for driving 65 in a 55-mph zone on his way home to visit family, and they discovered an outstanding warrant for speeding from Osage Beach, Missouri.\nGreen-Beckham says he found out the hard way about the warrant, which he resolved by paying $92 in cash.\nThe receiver was given a warning only by Van Buren police.\n\nOnline:\nAP NFL websites: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
