You look at our power numbers from August on, and we’re dangerous. So I think this park is going to help us as much as it helps them.\"\nAs he spoke, Collins seemed to have his chin out just a bit — figuratively, anyway.\nBOX SCORE: METS 5, CUBS 2\nHe’s friendly with Maddon, having hired him as his bench coach with the Angels two decades ago, but the Mets’ manager clearly didn’t like the idea that anyone might imply his team had been fortunate to get frigid weather in New York for Games 1 and 2.\nThen the Mets went out and backed him up on that.\nJacob deGrom delivered again and the Mets banged the ball around the Friendly Confines of Wrigley Field for 11 hits, including — what else? — another Daniel Murphy home run.\nMCCARRON: CESPEDES MAKES IMPACT WITH BAT AND LEGS\nThe result was a 5-2 win that puts the Mets in the rather stunning position of being able to sweep the NLCS on Wednesday and go the World Series. But here’s the kicker: there’s nothing fluky about it.\nThe Mets are outplaying the Cubs in every phase of the game, forcing them into mistakes in part with aggressive baserunning that speaks to the swagger they’ve developed over the last couple of months.\n“I tell you what, my guys are playing hard,\" was the way Collins put it after the game. “I mean, they’re running the bases. They’re doing things you’ve got to do right now to take advantage of any little chance you’ve got to try to score runs.\"\nMainly these Mets are playing with the type of killer instinct that often defines championship teams.\nFirst it was Yoenis Cespedes stealing third base in the sixth inning with the game tied 2-2 and making it look easy, putting pressure on the Cubs that paid off in the form of a wild pitch on a strikeout by Michael Conforto that put the Mets ahead for good.\nAnd then when the Cubs opened the door with a couple of misplays in the seventh, Kris Bryant double-clutching on Murphy’s ground ball, and Kyle Schwarber failing to haul in Cespedes’ catchable liner over his head, the Mets came storming through to take control, in part because of how much they forced the action on the bases.\nThe Mets? Baserunning? It was hardly their identity during the season, but it was part of their game plan for October.\n“It’s excellent game planning by our coaching staff coming into the playoffs and letting us try to run wild on the basepaths,\" said David Wright. “Under control, but if we had a lead early, to continue to put your foot on the gas and try to go.\n“That was kind of our mantra coming into the playoffs, to put pressure on the defense.\"\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE\nAlong the way they’ve exposed the Cubs a bit, in terms of their pitching depth and their defense. Basically, then, when they’re not hitting the ball out of the park and beating teams up offensively, they’re vulnerable.\nMaddon practically admitted as much afterward. He spoke of the Cespedes steal of third and said “that was our fault,” and then lamented the plays by Bryant and Schwarber as crucial.\n“They’ve played really well,\" he said of the Mets, “and they’ve done little things to take advantage of us in different moments. We’ve not been able to overcome that because we’re not hitting the ball like we normally can.\"\nNo, as it turned out, the unseasonably warm weather on Tuesday night didn’t help the Cubs’ bats as much as Maddon seemed to believe. They did hit two solo home runs, including a ridiculous opposite-field shot by Schwarber on a ball a foot outside.\nBut otherwise deGrom held them in check, and much as in Game 5 against the Dodgers, he did it by relying mostly on his off-speed stuff because the Cubs were on his fastball — again a testament to his toughness and polish as a complete pitcher.\nAnd let’s face it, the Mets’ pitching dominance is the biggest difference in this series, all the more so after they beat Jon Lester and Jake Arrieta in Games 1 and 2. Because much like the Dodgers, the Cubs can’t come close to matching the Mets’ depth in starting pitching.\nSo cold weather, warm weather, it doesn’t seem to matter. The Mets have the Cubs down and they seem to have the mindset to step on their neck and finish them off quickly.\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 3 NEXT SLIDE > Yoenis Cespedes plays a large role Tuesday night, driving in two runs and collecting three hits. - Corey Sipkin/New York Daily News © Provided by New York Daily News\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.nydailynews.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports", "http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/mccarron-cespedes-impact-mets-win-bat-legs-article-1.2405277", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Mets", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmgXCQ.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AAyrb0&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Daniel", "http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/murphy-degrom-put-mets-3-0-cubs-nlcs-article-1.2405208", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;baseball_mlb&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmgOzf.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmgQpm.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Jacob", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;deGrom", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Murphy", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmgZYw.img&quot;}}"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:05:09.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
