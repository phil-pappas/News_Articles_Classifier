The speedy sophomore, who entered the contest leading Brevard rushers with 785 yards, scored in every quarter on TD runs of 27, 2, 1, 39 and 40 yards. \n“We played sloppy, but in the second half we began to pick it up,” said Corbin. “The win felt good, I really think we can stay with anybody.” \nWhile Corbin is earning a reputation for his offensive feats, it may have been his acrobatic interception in the third quarter that gave the Tigers momentum early in the second half. Corbin’s theft led to his fourth touchdown with 6:39 remaining in the third quarter. \n“It felt good; me and Joc (Perry) are having a competition to see who can get the most picks and I’m winning right now,” said Corbin. “I’ve got two, but I also have a pick-six.” \nPerry scored the Tigers’ other touchdown on a 9-yard quarterback bootleg late in the third quarter. \nClass 3A Holy Trinity (5-1) did not pull away from the speedy Class 2A Saints until the final minutes. Agape Christian, which is coached by Victor Floyd, former FSU and NFL running back, was led by freshman QB Denardo Grey, who threw for 267 yards and three touchdowns. \nGray’s favorite targets were Cameron Stroud, who had seven catches for 147 yards, including TDs of 55 and 36 yards, and Carlos Reed with four receptions for 105 yards and one TD. \nThe Tigers have beaten the Saints three consecutive seasons, winning 30-0 in 2013 and 24-6 in 2014. \nCornerstone Charter Academy of Belle Isle visits the Saints on Thursday while the Tigers host Miami’s Archbishop Curley on Friday.
