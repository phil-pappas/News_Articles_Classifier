Utley's agent called the penalty \"outrageous and completely unacceptable\" and said there would be an appeal. The Mets and Dodgers are tied at 1-all in the NL Division Series. Game 3 is scheduled for Monday night at Citi Field. An appeal would allow Utley to play until the hearing process is complete. MLB would likely try to resolve the matter Monday, before the series resumes. In handing down the penalty, MLB executive Joe Torre called it an illegal slide. Umpires ruled it a legal play Saturday night. Torre said after a complete review, he concluded Utley's slide merited punishment.
