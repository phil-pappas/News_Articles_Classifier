Why can’t we be the team that surprises a lot of the experts (in the 32-6A race)?’ \n“I think San Benito is a team very similar to us in that at the end of the game, they feel they’re going to find a way to win,” Cantu added. “At the same time, we believe that we have a legitimate chance to go over there and bring back a victory for Brownsville. They’re a good team, but so are we.” \nRoy Hess covers sports for The Brownsville Herald. You can reach him via email at rhess@brownsvilleherald.com .
