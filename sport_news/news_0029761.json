He did that while shooting 47.5 percent from the field overall and 50 percent from 3-point range.\nThe second-year forward has proved to be a significant scorer in summer league and preseason. Does this mean he can get it done in the NBA regular season?\n\"I hope so. The kid, he puts the work in, there's no doubt about that,\" coach Fred Hoiberg said before Monday's game. \"He's always out there, working not only on offense, but some defensive things we're working on.\n\"Sure, he can be a guy that scores the ball at a high rate, especially when we get Derrick (Rose) back, Jimmy (Butler) making plays, playing through Pau (Gasol) -- that should open up a lot of scoring opportunities for Doug.\"\nRose visits locker room: Derrick Rose was at the United Center on Monday but did not sit on the bench during the game. Rose informally told reporters he's feeling better and is being fitted for a face mask Tuesday.\nRose has been out since suffering a fractured orbital bone under his left eye on the first day of practice on Sept. 29. He had surgery the next day and, for the most part, has been recovering at home since then.\nThe Bulls are hoping Rose can resume basketball activities on Wednesday or Thursday.\nSnell in slump: While Doug McDermott is scoring well in preseason, Tony Snell is battling a slump. Heading into Tuesday's action, Snell was shooting just 23 percent from the field (7 for 30), despite starting every game at small forward.\n\"Tony definitely took a step in the right direction (on Saturday against Minnesota),\" coach Fred Hoiberg said. \"I know he was only 2-for-10 last game, but he was really, really good defensively. He's shooting the ball well in practice. I'm confident if he keeps shooting it, he's going to take the lid off the rim.\n\"I've been happy with both those guys and I like the chemistry Doug has with that second unit right now.\"\nWhen preseason began, Hoiberg said he'd rotate the starting small forwards, then decided to stick with McDermott coming off the bench.\n\"It doesn't matter to me who starts the game,\" Hoiberg said. \"I want to see the guys who go out there and deserve it to be there at the end of the game when you're trying to win and who's going to make the clutch plays. Doug's been awesome. He's been great.\"\nLineup notes: Joakim Noah sat out his second straight game. The Bulls want to make sure he's healthy again after taking a hard fall against Denver last Thursday. ... Pau Gasol played in his second game after missing the first two. ... Coach Fred Hoiberg is hoping Taj Gibson makes his preseason debut on Wednesday against Detroit. Gibson is being brought along slowly after having left ankle surgery in June.\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
