No matter how high or how low Jenkins delivered the ball, Fream turned it into a kill. \n“It’s the best feeling when a hitter can adjust to your sets,” Jenkins said. “She was on it. As a setter that makes me feel good.” \nAs the fourth game rolled along, it became apparent to Jenkins that Fream had taken on the role of the team’s “hot hitter,” so she kept feeding her. \nOn this day, Fream was so locked in, she did not have an attack error — this despite sitting on the bench in Game 1. The junior could not attend a team practice before the match because of family obligations, and she served the penalty for missing the practice in the first game. \nThat didn’t interfere with her quality of play. \n“I think I was just hitting really well, and it boosted my confidence, and Meghan set really well, and it makes for good hits,” Fream said. \nAfter receiving congratulations from Niko, Fream looked over Cougars coach Sherry Levering’s shoulder to take a peek at the team’s stat sheet and expressed happiness over tying teammate Abby Jacobs for the team lead in kills against the Lions. \nFream and Jacobs begin their school days together in a unified sports class during which they interact with students who have special needs. Before school begins, Catoctin students listen to announcements that recap the previous day’s notable accomplishments in high school athletics. \n“We like to have our stats on the announcements, and we’re always really proud of each other,” Fream said of she and Jacobs. \nJacobs, who also had nine digs, did much of the heavy lifting during crucial junctures of the match. With the Cougars (6-6) and Lions (3-9) tied at 14 in Game 1, Jacobs tallied a kill, an ace and a crucial dig that led to one of Tori Bryant’s eight kills and a 23-19 advantage. \nAfter the teams were also knotted at 14 in Game 2, Jacobs collected four kills during the rest of the game. \n“That’s just her experience playing club volleyball and being a well-seasoned volleyball player,” Levering said. \nRebecca Thomson added 18 assists for Catoctin, and Kylie Norwood had seven kills and seven aces. \nThe Lions were on the brink of being swept, trailing 24-20 in Game 3 before rallying behind Megan McGee, who had two of her team-high eight kills in the rest of the game, and some tough back-row defense from Rylee Duncan and Jordan Middleton, who had 22 digs. \nAnna Eyler had 24 assists, while Collins tallied four kills and three blocks. \n“I really thought the team showed a lot of heart sticking it out and playing the entire game,” Walkersville coach Wendy Hickman said. “We have a strong defensive team, but sometimes we have a hard time putting the ball away (offensively).” Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:52:14.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
