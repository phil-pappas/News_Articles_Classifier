Ellington only 9 plays. Only 4 fewer than he saw in Detroit, despite 26 additional plays run. It's actually David Johnson that got the biggest increase in workload this week. I'd rather see Ellington get the most snaps. IMO, he is the best receiver of the group. 2. In the WR group, Fitz, Smoke and Floyd all had nearly identical participation as they saw in the Rams game. Jaron Brown had his most active day by seeing 27 plays, and thus continuing his trend of increased activity we saw last week against Detroit. 3. Darren Fells had half his normal activity, I think due to his injury. (I don't remember when he went out.) It was Gresham that picked up the slack, not Niklas... which should feed the \"ghost\" haters. Next week will be very telling for Troy. 4. All five starting OL saw all snaps on Offense. 5. For the D-Line, I see Freeney credited with 19 snaps, a full third for the day and more than I'd have anticipated. Frostey Rucker and Calais both saw about 15% more action than thus far into the season - all at the exepnse of Redding & Stinson. I think the blow-out wins probably allowed Redding and Stinson more time than they'd usually get, so I'd expect the current rotation to be closer to what we'll see week in and out. 6. Golden took Oakafor's snaps. Weatherspoon participated in exactly ONE snap. By my count, that is one more than he's had the past few weeks. I think his game checks are $250,000. For the last three games, that is $750k for exactly ONE play. Nice work if you can get it I suppose. 7. PP and Bucannon both played in all snaps. The Badger only missed one. Powers and Rashad continue to be on the field for +90% of all snaps.
