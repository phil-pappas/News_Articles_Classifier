The Tigers (4-0, 2-0 SEC) have been favored by double-digit points for three straight weeks now. That will likely end a week from Saturday when No. 11 Florida (5-0, 3-0 SEC) visits Tiger Stadium. After this week, LSU will face three of the best rushing defenses in the SEC over its next four games in Florida, Alabama and Arkansas. \nTime to work on the passing game? \nSaturday's game and an Oct. 24 home game against Western Kentucky before an open date and the trip to Alabama look like the last two opportunities to work on LSU's troubled aerial attack against lesser opponents. \n\"We'd like to throw a little bit more,\" said LSU coach Les Miles, whose passing attack is dead last in the SEC with 95.5 yards a game – 59 yards below the second worst passing attack. \nThe Tigers are 123rd in the nation in pass offense out of the 127 upper level schools. They are 13th of 14 in the SEC in passing efficiency at 112.4. Sophomore quarterback Brandon Harris was progressing decently, but last week he completed just 4 of 15 passes for 80 yards with an interception that was more of a fumble. And this was against 45-point underdog Eastern Michigan in a 44-22 win. On the season, Harris is 33 of 62 for 282 yards with two touchdowns and the interception for a 112.4 efficiency rating for 108th in the nation. \n\"We'd like to have a little bit more balance,\" Miles said. \"There are specific reasons for that.\" \nOne is LSU tailback Leonard Fournette, who leads the nation in rushing (864 yards) and in rushing yards per game (216) while running away with the Heisman Trophy in weekly polls so far. \n\"I feel that we're handing the ball to the right guys and making sure that they get their number of touches,\" Miles said. \"It's imperfect, but it's representative of the games that we've had and the situations we've been in.\" \nMiles had a problem with the touches by wide receivers Travin Dural and Malachi Dupre last week. Each dropped two passes that touched their hands. He blamed his receivers more for last week's passing totals than he did Harris. \n\"Brandon Harris is really doing what we ask him to do,\" Miles said. \"He's really on target. We just need to catch it.\" \nThe receivers have not. Usually steady John Diarse has also experienced the drops. \n\"We're looking at shuffling the lineup,\" Miles said. \"We're looking at all those things.\" Then he pulled back and said, \"I'm not ready to do that at this point in any wholesale fashion. We have to execute better, period.\" \nSomething may have to happen with the passing game or LSU will have to beat Florida, No. 8 Alabama, No. 14 Ole Miss and No. 9 Texas A&M one-dimensional style, which can be difficult. \n\"We're about to go into the meat of our schedule with SEC opponents,\" Diarse said. \"So we've got to find something. We've got to find a rhythm. We've got to find a flow of things.\" \nAs of now, things are flowing from Fournette. LSU has rushed the ball 186 times with 99 of those by Fournette. LSU has passed 62 times. So, LSU's offense has been 75 percent run. \n\"If they were recruiting me and they told me they were going to give the ball to Leonard or the other running backs 75 percent of the time, it might be hard to get a recruit at the receiver position or quarterback position,\" Dupre said two days after dropping two passes. \"But at the end of the day, we're here. We've got to live with it. We're doing the best that we can do blocking.\" \nSouth Carolina may afford LSU an opportunity to pass and catch Saturday. The Gamecocks are 13th in the SEC and 103rd nationally in pass efficiency defense with a 139.7 rating, having allowed 108-of-151 passing for 1,094 yards and seven touchdowns with a .715 completion percentage. \n\"When we get an opportunity,\" Dupre said, \"we've got to make the best of it.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wwltv.com/1Lmvnxo TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:00:26.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
