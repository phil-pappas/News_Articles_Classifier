Kicker Dan Carpenter left practice early Thursday, but Ryan expects him to play against the Giants.\nWide receiver Marquise Goodwin (ribs) and safety Aaron Williams (neck) were also limited. Meanwhile, quarterback Tyrod Taylor (ankle), linebacker Preston Brown (hamstring) and wide receiver Percy Harvin (hip) were full participants in practice.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/JoeBuscaglia/status/649650313071345664", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bills?src=hash", "https://t.co/coQG7mX3Ky"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:03:34.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
