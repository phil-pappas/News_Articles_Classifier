His existing contract expires at the end of this season. \nThe 24-year-old has represented England Saxons and he looks set to be a serious contender for England's RBS 6 Nations squad later this term. \n\"There is no doubt that Dave is one of the best young back-row forwards in the country,\" Exeter head coach Rob Baxter said. \n\"I think in many people's opinion he was unlucky not to be in or around that (England) World Cup group, come the end of the season. \n\"If Dave continues to improve in the way that he is and plays in the manner that he plays and does things as well as he does - particularly if we show success as a side - then I am sure that international recognition is just around the corner for him.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T11:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:21:17.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
