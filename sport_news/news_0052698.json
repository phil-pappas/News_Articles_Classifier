USA Today Sports 1 hr ago by Dan Wolken, USA TODAY Sports © Steve Mitchell, USA TODAY Sports Steve Mitchell, USA TODAY Sports One day after Miami athletics director Blake James suggested he would allow Al Golden to finish the season, the school reversed course on Sunday night and fired its football coach, effective immediately.\nAdChoices Golden leaves with a 32-25 record at the school and a damning 17-18 mark in the Atlantic Coast Conference. He replaced Randy Shannon, whose record at Miami was 28-22 and a similarly uninspiring 16-16 in the ACC.\nThis means that Miami, as a program, is basically .500 in the ACC over the last decade. That’s terrible. But it’s also indicative of a larger question.\nHow committed is this school to having a championship-caliber football program?\nMiami recently upgraded its football facilities on campus, and that’s terrific. It was way overdue, and it won’t be the huge obstacle to hiring a quality coach the way it was in 2010.\nBut this is also a program with some limitations.\nThis is a relatively small, private school in a market where support and interest is always going to be fickle. You play in a pro stadium that is nearly hour away from campus and too big to fill unless it’s just a massive game. And from a budget standpoint, Miami operates financially more as a “have-not” than a “have” within the ACC.\nBy that alone, you can pretty much cross any coach making $3 million or more off the list. Barring an administrative about-face from the way Miami has operated recently, this is going to be more of a bargain-basement type of hire than a big splash.\nThis is still a good job that many people will covet. But in a year where USC is open and others such as Virginia Tech could open, it is not going to be at the top of the list. With that in mind, here are some candidates for the Hurricanes.\nGreg Schiano: The 49-year old has spent two seasons in the TV booth after his failed NFL tenure with Tampa Bay, waiting for the right opportunity to get back in. Like many others who tried the NFL, Schiano’s act plays better in college, and he’s a rare proven winner who would take this job. Though he had just a 68-67 overall record at Rutgers, it was one of the most impressive program rebuilding jobs of all-time and set the stage for the Scarlet Knights to land in the Big Ten.\nRich Rodriguez: The word has been out for a long time that Rodriguez ultimately would prefer to land a job back in the Eastern time zone. And though he’s made Arizona very competitive very quickly in the Pac 12, it just sort of feels like he topped out last season when the Wildcats won the South division and landed a spot in the Fiesta Bowl. Rodriguez makes less than $3 million and might be intrigued by the idea of South Florida talent running his system.\nTommy Tuberville: He took the Cincinnati job right before the Big East fell apart, citing the fact his wife is from the area. But Tuberville has Miami ties, too, working there as an assistant (and ultimately defensive coordinator) during a glorious era between 1986-93. Tuberville is a longtime winner with an SEC championship on his résumé and he’s recruited Florida well at every subsequent stop.\nLarry Fedora: This season’s turnaround at North Carolina will help him if he’s looking for an escape hatch from Chapel Hill, where the African American Studies scandal still looms over the athletic department. Fedora is a Texas guy but coached at Florida between 2002-04 and has some Jimmy Johnson-style swagger to him that might fit well with those who embrace “The U.”\nDoc Holliday: He’s 30-6 at Marshall the last three seasons, runs a great offense and has deep connections in South Florida. A number of his best players at Marshall were guys such as Rakeem Cato from the Miami area who were overlooked or had off-field issues but became stars on Holliday’s watch. That kind of credibility can’t be overlooked in a relationship-oriented business.\nMario Cristobal: The former Hurricanes offensive tackle and assistant coach did a very good job at Florida International, getting them to bowl games in 2010 and 2011. His firing in 2012 by athletics director Pete Garcia remains one of the biggest mysteries of all time on the coaching carousel. Cristobal has spent the past three years as Alabama’s offensive line coach, and given his background and program connections, he might be the most sensible hire Miami could make.\nFrank Wilson: He has three titles at LSU in running backs coach, recruiting coordinator and associate head coach. Wilson, a former Louisiana high school coach, is by far Les Miles’ most trusted and valuable assistant and will be a head coach soon. Would Miami be a big leap for Wilson? Maybe. But if the school wants to be a player at the highest level of recruiting, you have to at least look at someone who’s been named the national recruiter of the year by multiple publications and has coached some of the most talented and productive running backs in college football.\nTom Herman/Justin Fuente: We’ll group these two together because their names are going to be mentioned for every job this year. It’s hard to see Fuente, a serious football coach in the Gary Patterson mold who doesn’t have much time for salesmanship, embracing the Miami lifestyle. Herman recently complained to the Houston media about empty seats at home games. That’s going to be the same problem any coach runs into at Miami.\nMark Richt: He’s a former Miami quarterback who may need a fresh start. That's about the only reason to throw his name in the mix.\nLane Kiffin: They wouldn’t. Would they?\nGALLERY: AMWAY COACHES POLL\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:25:43.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
