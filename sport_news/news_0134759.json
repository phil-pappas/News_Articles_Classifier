I ain’t been nervous since the fifth grade.”\nAlec Burks\nHONOLULU — Fourteen years ago, a 10-year-old Alec Burks had butterflies about playing in his first organized basketball game.\nFast forward to Sunday night’s preseason-opening game against the Los Angeles Lakers, and the Utah Jazz shooting guard won’t be experiencing similar nerves. Who cares if it will be his first game back after a shoulder surgery that sidelined him for the final three-and-a-half months of the 2014-15 season?\nThis is 24-year-old Alec Burks, a fifth-year NBA player, we’re talking about, not some little fifth-grader from Grandview, Missouri.\n“I don’t get nervous,” Burks said. “I ain’t been nervous since the fifth grade.”\nHe then repeated the “I don’t get nervous” claim for good measure.\n“I can’t wait,” said Burks, who tried playing through left shoulder pain last season before finally having surgery. \"It’s been a long wait since December.\"\nTraining camp has been underway for less than a week, but that’s the attitude of all of the Jazz players.\n“We’re ready to get to Hawaii and play against another team,” Jazz small forward Gordon Hayward said earlier this week.\nUnlike his older teammate, rookie Trey Lyles admitted he might have some first-time jitters for his first taste of NBA action — a 7 p.m. MT game against the returning Kobe Bryant and his Lakers squad, which will be televised from the Stan Sheriff Center on ROOT Sports and NBA-TV.\n“I get nervous before every game,” the 19-year-old Lyles said. “Once I get going, it goes away, so I guess it’s a good thing.”\nJazz coach Quin Snyder has been encouraged by the level of focus and effort his team has displayed during the first week of training camp, so he’s curious to see how that translates into a game situation.\n“I’d like to see those things manifest themselves in the game,” Snyder said. “Guys have a tendency to lose track of that, especially early in the year.”\nSnyder hasn’t revealed who he’ll start in the first preseason game outside of Hayward, power forward Derrick Favors and center Rudy Gobert. With Dante Exum out for the season due to a knee injury, third-year playmaker Trey Burke seems to be the probable starter at point guard.\nBurks and Rodney Hood are the likely shooting guard starters, and it wouldn’t be surprising if Snyder went with the more experienced Burks who was in the first five before going down with his season-ending injury just over nine months ago.\n“For me right now, it’s more about seeing our group with certain guys — Al having a chance to play again, just different combinations for our guys who have been our key players, not to say everybody is not important,” Snyder said. “We’d like to see how guys work together.”\nAlong with Lyles, first-year players Raul Neto (point guard) and Tibor Pleiss (center) are set to see their first NBA exhibition action.\nSnyder has been impressed with how Burks has bounced back from his injury. The coach reminded reporters that the athletic 6-foot-6 guard led the Jazz in catch-and-shoot 3-pointers before his injury last season and spoke highly of Burks’ defensive ability.\n“He’s playing with a lot of confidence,” Snyder said. “ We’ve been pretty demanding of him on the defensive end. I think he’s taking some pride in that. He’s a good defender too. Our team wasn’t very good at that point. When he went down, he was probably playing better or as well as anybody we have (defensively).”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:36:42.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
