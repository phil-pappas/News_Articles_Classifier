He hooked up with the RedBlacks for seven weeks before Ottawa booted Alix out of town. \nAlix did return to Ottawa for Toronto’s second win over the Redblacks, but his days in Toronto now appear over. \nSwayze Waters isn’t close to returning following his second injury of the season, but even Waters at 10% represents a better option for the Argos. \nLate in the third quarter, the Argos had Justin Palardy handle the punting duties, Toronto’s field-goal kicker who missed from 42 yards out in the opening quarter. \nWhether it’s an American, Canadian, whatever the case may be, the Argos need to do something to solidify their punting game. \nMilanovich said following his team’s win that Alix got hurt, but even healthy the days of Alix should be over in Toronto. \n“The play on special teams hurt us with field position,’’ said Milanovich. “We found a way a win and we knew it wouldn’t be easy. That’s a prideful football team. \n“It wasn’t a great performance, but we found a way to win.” \nThe Argos also found a way to overcome a successful on-side kick by the Als, who took deep into Toronto’s territory before expiring, a drive kept alive by a great one-handed reception by Samuel Giguere on third down. \nOf course, had the Argos converted on a field goal attempt, the late-game drama would have been avoided. \nWhen teams take up a roster by going with an American, these imports, except for rare exceptions, must handle all three facets, punting, field goals and kickoffs. \nThat’s what made Waters, when healthy, so valuable and as it turns out so valuable and indispensable. \nWhen he got hurt in the season opener, it was left up to Stala to do all three. \nThe Argos then signed Ronnie Pfeffer, the kid the team should have on its roster, only the RedBlacks are hiding the Canadian on their injured list, even though he’s not hurt. \nIt’s not uncommon, but it’s a tactic the CFL must end. \nIt’s anyone’s guess who will punt for the Argos this Saturday against Calgary. \nOn this afternoon, the Argos were lucky because the Als are quarterback poor, forced to go with all three signal-callers, but no one stepped up. \nRakeem Cato was average before leaving with an injury. \nAnthony Boone and Tanner Marsh were as bad as Toronto’s kicking game.
