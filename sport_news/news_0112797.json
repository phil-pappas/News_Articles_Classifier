It's the most important thing so I have to appeal,\" Mourinho said. \nMourinho on Thursday night addressed the penalty, which was announced by the FA on Wednesday. \n\"Every word I say is a big risk for me,\" he said on Thursday. \n\"I am happy that I don't have an electronic tag. I think it's not far from (that). \n\"I also think that GBP50,000 in the world where we live today is an absolute disgrace. \n\"And I also think that the possibility of getting a stadium ban is also something absolutely astonishing.\" \nThe stadium ban will be imposed if Mourinho speaks out of turn in the next 12 months, but it is understood the FA is unlikely to pursue Thursday night's comments. \nA more pressing priority for Mourinho is finding solutions for Chelsea's current slump, five months after being crowned champions. \nThe Blues enter Saturday's match at home to Aston Villa 16th after four defeats in the opening eight Premier League games. \nMourinho called for the backing of the Chelsea board after the October 3 loss to Southampton and a first vote of confidence of Roman Abramovich's 12-year ownership was issued. \nChelsea have dispensed with numerous managers, often when when Champions League qualification is in doubt. \nBut Mourinho says he will not be sacked even if Chelsea are adrift in the race for the top four. \nAsked if he would still be in charge if Chelsea finish in mid-table, Mourinho said \"Yes\", before adding: \"No. I was not told that because we don't expect to finish mid-table.\" \nFollowing the Saints loss, Mourinho, who has won three Premier League titles over two spells, suggested the Blues would be sacking the best manager they ever had if he was fired. \nNow Abramovich's approach to his managers is different, according to the Portuguese, who was reappointed in June 2013. \n\"It's different for many reasons, since the moment I came back in 2013, when I had my first conversation with the owner and the board in 2013,\" he said. \nThe competition in the Premier League means Chelsea could miss out on the top four this term, as Manchester United and Liverpool have done in recent seasons. \nThe Blues are seven points adrift and 10 behind leaders Manchester City. \n\"Somebody will be out (of the top four). Do I think it's Chelsea? No,\" Mourinho said. \nMourinho lost one of 100 Premier League home games, but has now lost two in his last three after the Southampton defeat. \nThe Portuguese admits playing at the champions' Stamford Bridge home is a less daunting than it once was. \n\"I really believe that every team that comes now to Stamford Bridge, they don't fear us, they feel that they can get a result,\" Mourinho said.
