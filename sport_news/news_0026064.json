He kicked his goals superbly and his game management was good.\" \nPeter Betham scored Leicester's only try with Bell converting it and kicking seven penalties as Tigers finished strongly to gain a win. \nCockerill continued: \"We put ourselves under pressure in the first half but I was pleased with our attitude and justifiably deserved to win in the end.\" \n\"With a new coaching staff, they were difficult to break down and we struggled to get any continuity.\" \nLeicester did not include any players involved in the World Cup, apart from replacement Opeti Fonua. \nThe coach added: \"We made a conscious effort to rest our World Cup players and despite temptation stuck with that decision. \n\"We wanted to give the players who had been with us for 15 weeks pre-season training as they deserved to have an opportunity.\" \n\"However, most of the players involved in the World Cup will be in the 23 to face Harlequins next Sunday.\" \nLondon Irish boss Tom Coventry conceded that his side had contributed to their downfall. \nThe hosts managed one try from Jebb Sinclair with Chris Noakes kicking three penalties and a conversion - however careless errors prevented them scoring more points and possibly pulling off a surprise victory. \nCoventry added: \"We were too sloppy, we weren't clinical enough at vital times and we let ourselves down.\" \n\"There were 19 handling errors, most of them in midfield and there was a lack of game management.\" \n\"There was a lot of good stuff, our forwards made a good fist of it and had we taken a couple of opportunities at crucial times, the result may have been different. \n\"Eoin Griffin being hauled down inches short of the line was very unlucky - if he had taken another step he surely would have scored.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T20:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:19:45.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
