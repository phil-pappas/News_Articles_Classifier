The end result may not have been all that the Harrisburg High School senior had hoped for, but she has little regret. Burtis finished 53rd overall (out of 103) as an individual at this weekend’s IHSA State Golf Tournament at Red Tail Run in Decatur, shooting a 52-45-197 on the final day. “I just want to strike the ball well and have a good time,” Burtis said. “I was very happy with my score on the first day. The second day could have been better, but the weather made it very hard to get a good break and my putting struggled (Saturday). “For me, I take away that I had the opportunity that most golfers don’t get to experience and I’m glad all the hard work finally paid off by me getting to go to state.” Burtis finished her round Friday 34th overall after she fired a front nine 43 and went out with a 45. “I had a lot of fun,” Burtis added. “Overall, I played pretty well and the first day was good, but the second day was just rough. I couldn’t catch a break with any shot and the weather was terrible.” Mother Nature did wreak havoc on players enough where they had to push back tee times due to cold and wind. “It made the game a lot more difficult,” Burtis said of the weather. “I had a good time regardless and it was an experience that I’ll never forget.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:14:30.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
