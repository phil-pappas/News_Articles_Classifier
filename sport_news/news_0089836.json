But the Washington State quarterback delivered a rather painful update Saturday afternoon. The Cougar sophomore threw six touchdown passes in the first half and short-circuited any notion of the Beavers bouncing back from a demoralizing loss at Arizona a week ago. If anything, Saturday's 52-31 drilling was even more of a bummer, the Beavers allowing scores on all seven WSU possessions before intermission and spotting the Cougars a four-touchdown lead. And no one was more responsible than Falk, who played high school football with Andersen's twin sons, Chasen and Hagen, in Logan High School when he was head coach at Utah State. Out of high school, Falk committed to play at Cornell before deciding to walk on at Washington State, and early in the week Andersen expressed an admiration for being \"a self-made guy\" after \"nobody gave him a chance.\" Andersen was no less impressed Saturday. \"He was on fire,\" Andersen admitted. \"We helped him at times be on fire but, hey, that's football. \"In this offense, they have the ability to throw the football, and if you can't disrupt routes or have the ability to disrupt the quarterback, that's going to make it hard.\" How sharp was Falk? He had fewer incompletions (five) than touchdowns (a school-record tying six) in the first half. He connected on 19 straight pass attempts in a stretch spanning the second and third quarters. He mixed his throws to 11 different receivers, finishing with 407 yards on 39-of-50 passing. Falk wasn't able to keep that edge in the second half. Whether the Cougars eased off the intensity pedal or the Beavers made some adjustments, efficiency dropped significantly, and Falk threw a pair of interceptions, after going 117 attempts without one. \"He was just reading our coverage and making plays off of it,\" said OSU safety Justin Strong. “In the second half, we disguised more and bought into what the coaches have been teaching in practice and started playing more as a team.\" PRESSURE IS OFF : One of the reasons Falk was so effective? The Beavers' anemic pass rush. Ranking 114th out of 127 FBS teams in sacks with just six in five games, the Beavers made a point of addressing the pressure issue in practice during the week. Defensive coordinator Kalani Sitake tinkered with four-man fronts — inserting freshman Sumner Houston at tackle for more push — and other means of getting pressure. But the impact was negligible. Falk rarely had to move in the pocket, and WSU already had a 38-17 lead by the time the Beavers finally broke through on Falk — Titus Failauga dropping him for a 12-yard loss. The Beavers killed another Cougar drive in the third quarter with a 17-yard sack by Jonathan Willis. \"Whether it was a four-man rush or a creative way to bring five, or max blitzes — we did them all in the first half,\" Andersen said. \"The one thing we felt was dropping eight was not the answer. We've seen (Falk) just carve apart a drop-eight. We had everything else in the arsenal.\" MOSTLY SPECIAL : The Beavers were already trailing 21-3 when they opted for what seemed like a desperation move — a fake punt from their own 20-yard line on fourth-and-3 early in the second quarter. But punter Nick Porebski's rugby run fooled no one, especially WSU's Colton Teglovic, who steamed in to drop the punter for a 6-yard loss. Yet if anything, special teams were a highlight of OSU's day. A few minutes later, Victor Bolden broke loose up the right sideline for a 100-yard kickoff return for a touchdown, the second of his career and tying a school record. And though the game was decided by then, the fourth quarter produced two more special teams gems — Malik Gilmore recovering a fumbled onside kick return, and Willis blasting in to block a punt that led to OSU's final touchdown. \"This is a wild game,\" Andersen said. \"Everything was better in the second half. Special teams — we were finally in a position to make a couple of aggressive calls and have some good things happen.\" ON THE REBOUND : After a disastrous evening against Arizona, quarterback Seth Collins had a significant bounce-back day — even if his numbers were produced after the Beavers had dug themselves the deepest of holes. The freshman from San Diego had his third 100-yard rushing day of the season, finishing with 124 on 23 carries, and completed 17 of 30 passes for 176 yards and a touchdown, though he had two damaging picks. One resulted in an 84-yard touchdown return by Shalom Luani in the waning moments. \"It's risky business right now as much as we're running the quarterback,\" Andersen allowed. \"It's almost an option team. Is that where we want to live as we go forward? I'm not going to say that's where we want to live, but that's where we need to live today.\" Collins said building on some of the rhythm the Beavers found in the second half will be important. \"We have to focus on trying to make the game fun,\" he said. \"Once we start making it fun and doing what we do, we're going to start moving the ball.\" EXTRA POINTS : Tight end Kellen Clute did not play for what an OSU spokesman said was a violation of team rules … The Beavers lost senior cornerback Larry Scott to a right ankle sprain on Gabe Marks' 23-yard touchdown catch two plays into the second quarter … Houston, tight end Brent VanderVeen and cornerback Dwayne Williams made their first career starts … Garrett Owens' 50-yard field goal in the first quarter was a career long.
