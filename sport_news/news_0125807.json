That same arm left the Golden Bears reeling after a career-high five interceptions in a 30-24 loss to No. 5 Utah.\n\"This is probably the worst game of my life,\" Goff said. \"But it's going to have to be something I'm going to have to get better at and learn from. They are one of the best defenses in the country for a reason.\"\nCalifornia threw five interceptions for the first time since 1998 and six total turnovers were too much to overcome. The Golden Bears were still alive late and drove to the Utah 21-yard line on its last possession, but the drive stalled and they gave the ball back on downs.\n\"I think we all wanted to win really bad, especially Jared,\" Cal coach Sonny Dykes said. \"Sometimes when you want to win really badly, you might try and do a little too much.\"\nGoff may have been a turnover machine with four first-half interceptions, which matched his season total from the first five games, but he never became tentative. The four interceptions were a career high and he had 30 minutes left to play. His first truly bad throw may have been the fourth-quarter interception to Hatfield when he threw off his back foot while being pressured. The Golden Bears were driving to tie the game.\nGoff threw for 340 yards and two touchdowns, but the Heisman contender couldn't overcome the ball-control issues that put the Golden Bears (5-1, 2-1 Pac-12) in a hole.\n\"Just too many mistakes to win the footall game,\" Dykes said.\nUtah spent the last two weeks downplaying its rise to No. 5 in the polls. The Utes sent a message Saturday night that they have no plans on going anywhere but up.\nThe team picked to finish fifth in the Pac-12 South is now the lone undefeated team remaining in the conference after a 30-24 victory over No. 23 California.\n\"We don't feel pressure because we know what type of team we are,\" Utah defensive back Boobie Hobbs said. \"We feel like we're the No. 1 team. We just want to show the world that we can play with the Alabamas, the LSUs. We've got the guys and we've got great talent.\"\nThe Utes missed several opportunities to grab a sizable lead with erratic offense. Utah scored 17 of its 24 points off turnovers, but was held scoreless on two possessions after turnovers and settled for three on another. The seven-point halftime lead could have been much more had the Utes been able to put up more than three off two of Goff's interceptions and Daniel Lasco's fumble.\nDevontae Booker ran for a season-high 222 yards and two touchdowns and added a team-high 45 receiving yards for the Utes (5-0, 2-0). They sit alone atop to the conference and are firmly in the College Football Playoffs discussion.\n\"My offensive line deserves credit, they made it happen for me and I wouldn't have over 200 yards without them,\" Booker said. \"Every week, I know I'm the focal point of the offense. Whether it's receiving or running the ball or even blocking, I just got to do it all.\"\nThe Utes entered the game with seven interceptions and Marcus Williams, Justin Thomas, Gionni Paul and Dominique Hatfield all picked off passes in the first half. Hatfield had another interception in the fourth quarter and Williams recovered a fumble.\nUtah quarterback Travis Wilson finished with 170 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions.\n\"I thought our defenders did a nice job of showing coverages or showing pressure and then backing out of it, disguising things,\" Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said. \"But then I just think we made some real athletic plays.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:36:21.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
