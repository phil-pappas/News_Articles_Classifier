More \nFighting in front of a packed house at Omaha's CenturyLink Center, his hometown crowd, Crawford defended his World Boxing Organization junior welterweight title against Jean, the No. 2 world-rated contender. \nCrawford has fought three of his last four bouts at the CenturyLink Center, with the lone exception being his April 2014 win over Thomas Dulorme in Arlington, Texas. \nAfter going southpaw at the very end of the first round, Crawford knocked Jean down as the final seconds ticked away with a right hook. It was a sign of things to come. \nBaiting Jean into tepid jabs and half-hearted combinations, Crawford counter-punched his way through the first few rounds. Per usual, he fought a patient fight and waited until Jean lunged to find opportunities to counterattack. \nAt no point was Crawford on the defensive. \nBlood began forming around Jean's right eye late in the fifth round, and Crawford began to target the area. \nJean was again knocked down at the end of the ninth round, and the fight was ended by the referee in the 10th round, giving Crawford a win by TKO. \n\"I'd like to thank everyone that came out and supported me,\" he said after the win. \nRumors circulated before the fight that Saturday night was something of an audition for Crawford, as Manny Pacquiao announced he would fight one more time before retiring and a Pacquiao-Crawford fight could be next. \nIf it was indeed an audition, consider Crawford's performance a stellar showing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:07:24.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
