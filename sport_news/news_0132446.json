This was just the third time this season that the Choctaws have been held without a goal. \nDaryl Bell got the offense moving with a goal in the 22nd minute of the first half, and she struck against less than 90 seconds later with her 10th goal of the year. Sara Helgadottir was credited with her third assist of the season on Bell’s first goal, and Kaley Ward chipped in with her fourth assist this year on Bell’s second goal. \nBell becomes just the second player in the GSC with 10 goals on the year. The win moves UWF into fifth place overall in the GSC standings and into fourth among teams eligible for the postseason. \nUWF will travel to Valdosta State for a GSC match on Wednesday before hosting West Georgia in the team’s regular-season finale on Saturday. \nVSU sits at 3-6-1 in conference play, while West Georgia stands just behind UWF at 6-3-1.
