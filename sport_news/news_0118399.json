The three-day event’s inaugural session, ‘Always Khush, Always Wanted’, was a vivid reflection of the celebrated writer’s influence on the life of the people he was close to, including those from Pakistan. Khushwant, who often made fun of himself and religion, was described as a lively person inspiring all with his honest demeanour. Ameena Saiyid, managing director, Oxford University Press (OUP) in Pakistan, a special invitee, said the late writer readily helped those looking for cultural solace. She said as a tribute, OUP would soon publish Pakistani version of his famous novel Train to Pakistan which, she hoped, could bridge the gap between the two nations. Former J&K CM Farooq Abdullah said Khushwant had no malice against anyone, and that people fell in love with his lively persona. Former Indian cricket captain Bishen Singh Bedi said, “Khushwant’s penchant to pen down Santa Banta jokes brought him fame as well as rebuke from the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, though he cared little for their authority.” Syeda Hameed, Pakistan’s first elected women representative and former ambassador to the US, said Khushwant inspired her to write a book. She said he was replete with humour, humanity and warmth and his presence inspired all who met him. The evening was also marked by the centenary year of another noted writer, Bhisham Sahni. Actor Om Puri and several other noted personalities, including Govind Nihalani and Dr Farokh Udwadia, also shared their experiences with the writer. Khushwant’s son Rahul Singh, daughter-in-law Nilopher Singh and nephew Pami Singh were also present.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:13:55.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
