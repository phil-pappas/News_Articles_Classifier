Barrett to make his first start of the 2015 season this week for the top-ranked Buckeyes over Cardale Jones came down to recent on-field production.\n“J.T. has earned the right to start Saturday at Rutgers,” Meyer said on the Big Ten coaches’ teleconference this afternoon.\nBarrett, who finished fifth in the 2014 Heisman Trophy race and was the starter in every game of the regular season last year before suffering a broken ankle in the finale win over Michigan, watched Jones – star of the three-game post-season run to the ’14 national title -- make the first seven starts of this season. But Barrett stepped into the role as red zone quarterback specialist two games ago after a fitful complete game by Jones a week earlier at Indiana, and now Barrett has risen from closer to starter.\n“Just sheer production,” Meyer said of the reason for the switch.\nThe Buckeyes went 12 for 12 scoring wise -- 11 touchdowns, one field goal -- in the red zone (from the 20-yard line and in) combined the past two games. Barrett was at the controls for 11 of those scores, one being the field goal last week against Penn State.\nBut it also was obvious as last week’s game developed, his running ability and deft operation of the option with running back Ezekiel Elliott were the big difference makers in the 38-10 win against a stout PSU defense. Barrett wound up entering the game for good as the QB late in the third quarter.\n“It was a difficult decision, but the red zone production and the third down production were the two areas that made the difference,” Meyer said.\nIn other news, Meyer said that “as of this morning I got a probable” on the status of senior linebacker Joshua Perry for the game at Rutgers. Perry had to leave the PSU game early in the first quarter after suffering an ankle sprain.\ntmay@dispatch.com\n@TIM_MAYsports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:09:36.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
