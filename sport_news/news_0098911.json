(AP) - A New York state board is expected to decide soon whether to allow a racino in the state's Southern Tier to expand into a full casino.\nTioga Downs' bid for a casino license was initially denied last year, but the facility in Nichols revised its proposal after Gov. Andrew Cuomo asked gambling regulators to reopen bidding for the casino license.\nLocal leaders in the Southern Tier say the jobs and economic activity from a casino would be a boon for the economically struggling region.\nThe Gaming Facility Location Board is expected to announce its recommendation to the state's Gaming Commission at a meeting Wednesday in New York City. Tioga Downs is the only contender for the license.\nThe proposal also includes a new hotel, restaurants and a concert venue.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:31:27.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
