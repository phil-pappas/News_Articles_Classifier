This year, the Rockets returned the favor. Central scored 3 times in the first 45 minutes, then held on for dear life to beat the Whip-Purs, 3-2, in the Class 2A Hampshire boys soccer regional semifinals Tuesday. The Rockets will face Fenton on Friday for the regional title. Jack Shramme scored twice and Cole Tecza added a goal and an assist for the Rockets (12-10-1). Hampshire controlled play early, but the Rockets got on the board first, when Shramme's shot squirted just off the goalkeeper's hands in the 34th minute. Three minutes later, it was déjà vu as Tecza's free kick trickled in. Hampshire lost goalkeeper Jason Polletta on a diving save attempt early in the second half. Freshman backup Andy Krajecki had barely settled in when Shramme fired in a rocket across the net from about 30 yards out. Central maintained that advantage for more than 20 minutes, but the Whip-Purs refused to go quietly. Parker Bishop banged in the rebound of a shot by Tyler Koppie to get the Whips on the board with 11:41 left. Two minutes later, Douglas Stuehler knocked one in off a corner kick and Hampshire was back in business. \"We can't wait 70 minutes to get going,\" said Hampshire coach John Gosling. \"We knew coming into this game that we were a better team, but their intensity is what carries them.\" The Whips couldn't get another chance. They almost had one when a rebound caromed out. Stuehler was in the neighborhood but couldn't quite get there for a ahot. \"We just knew we had to keep our cool,\" said Tecza. \"Things got a little out of hand at the end, but its sloppy conditions, and lots of things played into it. We just needed to close out the game better and play strong throughout the game like we know we can.\" Fenton 4, Kaneland 1: In the first game, Kaneland came within 18 minutes of upsetting second-seeded Fenton. The Knights grabbed an early lead on a goal by Drew Franklin. Once the Bison found the back of the net, however, the floodgates opened. Fenton scored 4 times in the final 18 minutes for a 4-1 win. Jacob Slomkowski, Juan Ayala, Darwin Medina, and Angel Barriga scored for the Bison (10-8-1).
