For comparison’s sake, when translating these numbers to actual viewers, it would be slightly worse than a “Thursday Night Football” game on CBS/NFL Network but better than a “Monday Night Football” game on ESPN. \nAccording to the league, an individual stream was counted if a viewer stayed and watched for more than three seconds. The 33.6 million streams far exceeded the 3.5 million that Yahoo promised to advertisers. \nOurand added that as much as 33 percent of the audience (more than 5 million viewers) came from 180 international markets. \nAnd then there’s this: One three-hour football game garnered about 41 percent of the online numbers garnered by a three-week college basketball tournament. Bills/Jags did 33.6M live streams, 7.7M hrs live video consumed. All of March Madness Live '15: 80.7M live streams, 17.8M hrs live video \nSome more comparisons, via CNN : \nThe partners did not release any data for the simultaneous number of live streams. But if they surpassed 2 million, as the data indicates, then the Bills-Jaguars game is one for the Internet record books, if not the NFL’s. \nCNN’s recent debates peaked with almost 1 million simultaneous live streams. Last season’s Super Bowl peaked with 1.3 million. \n(Then again, those events were also shown on TV, and the vast majority of people chose to watch the traditional way.) \nPer CNN, the NFL said Monday that it was “thrilled with the results.” After spending the first 17 years of his Post career writing and editing, Matt and the printed paper had an amicable divorce in 2014.
