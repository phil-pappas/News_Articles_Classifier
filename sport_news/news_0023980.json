(Supplied) \nHistory was created in the UAE when for the first time a women’s cricket league got underway in Dubai with ICC Academy scoring a 23-run win over GMC Academy. Winning the toss and batting first, ICC were jolted early when their opener Priyanjali Jain was run-out for nought after facing only three balls. But ‘woman of the match’ Kyna Vedhasinghe and Roopa Nagaraj stitched up a valuable partnership. Roopa chipped in with 19 from 26 balls after striking two fours while Kyna was going great guns even though she was losing partners at the other end. However, the heat seemed to have taken a toll on her and she was run out for a match-winning 33 from 41 balls. Her knock consisted of three boundaries. None of the other batswomen could get into double figures but ICC Academy managed a decent 78 for 8 from their 20 overs. Chamani Senevirathne was the most impressive bowler for GMC with three wickets while Shalani Wanniaracchi, Shini Khalid and Sadia Bano bagged a wicket each. Captain Chamani also top-scored for her team with 18 but with six of their batswomen failing to open their accounts, GMC were well short of their target. For the winners, Namita D’Souza (3-19), Fatima Ahsan (2-7), Kyna Vedhasinghe (1-7), Roopa Nagaraj (1-7) and Kaveesha Kumari (1-6) all played their roles to perfection. The single round-robin tournament has three teams - Sharjah Cricket Academy, ICC Academy and GM Academy. It was a pleasant sight to see the women all geared up in whites and raring to have a go at the bat and ball. A sizeable crowd turned up at the Fairgrounds of the Dubai Men’s College on Saturday to support these women and encourage them to do better. All this was made possible due to the efforts of the Dubai Cricket Council and its chairman Abdul Rahman Falaknaz who came forward to promote women’s cricket without any sponsorship. Brief scores: ICC Academy beat GMC Academy by 23 runs ICC 78 for 8 in 20 overs (Kyna Vedhasinghe 33, Roopa Nagaraj 19; Chamani Senevirathne 3-10, Shalani Wanniaracchi 1-12, Shini Khalid 1-19, Sadia Bano 1-22) GMC 55 all out in 14.3 overs (Chamani Senevirathne 18; Namita D’Souza 3-19, Fatima Ahsan 2-7, Kyna Vedhasinghe 1-7, Roopa Nagaraj 1-7, Kaveesha Kumari 1-6). Woman of the match: Kyna Vedhasinghe of ICC.
