(AP) - A New Hampshire woman accused of unlawfully receiving more than $66,000 in benefits has pleaded guilty in federal court.\nBeverly Eaton pleaded guilty to Social Security fraud and false statement charges in Concord Monday.\nThe U.S. Department of Justice says the 57-year-old Seabrook woman began illegally receiving Social Security disability benefits in 2009, as well as food stamps and Medicaid in 2008.\nOfficials say Eaton lied to the Social Security Administration and the state Department of Health and Human Services, by saying she did not own real estate. She owned two properties, both with an assessed value of over $20,000, which would have made her ineligible to receive supplemental security income benefits, food stamps and Medicaid.\nEaton faces five years in prison. She's set to be sentenced Jan. 12.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:32:12.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
