Offensive coordinator Clay Helton was appointed interim coach Sunday. \nUSC hasn’t elaborated on Sarkisian’s problems, but the second-year coach had an embarrassing public display in August at a pep rally where he appeared to be intoxicated while giving a speech. Sarkisian later apologized and said he had combined alcohol and medication, but promised not to drink again during the season. \nSarkisian’s unsteady appearance Sunday prompted Haden to make the program’s fourth coaching change in just more than two years. \nSarkisian went 12-6 as head coach at USC. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:00:23.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
