Kate Brown briefly addressed the crowd. \"In our sorrow, we will remember and honor those lost here today,\" she said. \"And in this way, they will live forever in our hearts.\"\nThe college's interim president, Rita Cavin, asked that people share their love, not their anger, with the central Oregon school's students and faculty.\n\"Anger caused this, and we can't have anger around us right this minute,\" she said.\nAt least one speaker asked that the crowd not at all mention the name of the alleged gunman, 26-year-old Chris Harper-Mercer . Authorities said the gunman was killed in a shootout with police.\nBut others in the crowd asked that the shooter and his parents be included in the community's prayers.\n\"I don't know the grief I would feel if it were my child who did this,\" said Barbara Contreras, a mother of six. \"They're going to feel such guilt. They lost their child tonight, too.\"\nCandlelight vigil held for victims of UCC shooting A candlelight vigil was held Thursday night at Stewart Park in Roseburg for the victims of the Umpqua Community College shooting earlier in the day.\nThere were both tears of joy and sorrow in Stewart Park as smartphones lit up among the glass or Styrofoam-encased candles, bringing more news of the long day's aftermath.\nSome received messages affirming the safety of loved ones. Others waited anxiously to hear from friends or relatives whose status was yet unknown.\nNews filtered in about the injured waking up, developing infections and going back into surgery.\n\"It was just frantic getting in touch with people\" over the course of the afternoon, said Isaiah Smith, who recently graduated from high school in Roseburg.\n\"It was a relief when I heard my friends' voices,\" Austin Dowden, another recent graduate, said. \"I'm still nervous to hear about the list of names of people harmed.\"\nAt least two people in the Roseburg area began compiling a list of people who had confirmed they were OK on Thursday morning and sharing updated versions of the list on Facebook.\n\"It was a very good thing,\" said Chantelle Smith, who attended Umpqua Community College last year. \"It's amazing how technology has helped us.\"\nGov. Kate Brown speaks at Roseburg vigil Hundreds gathered in Stewart Park on Thursday night following a mass shooting at Umpqua Community College.\nChelsey Brown was one of many who turned to Facebook after hearing initial news of the shooting.\nShe saw a suggestion that there be a vigil about 11 a.m. and immediately got to work collecting candles.\n\"I lost count at 400 and something candles,\" she said. \" I just started throwing things in my van.\"\nBrown and Gail Kuntz had soon organized much of the event's logistics.\nJohn Parker's immediate impulse after hearing there was an active shooter on campus was to leave the shelter of the school's veterans' center to try to help.\nThe 36-year-old veteran and a few others have concealed carry licenses, Parker said, but a school employee talked them out of leaving.\n\"If we would have run across the field, we would have been targets,\" he said. \"We made a good choice at the time.\"\nParker and several others watched TV news broadcasts and used smartphone apps to listen to scanner traffic, he said. \"We watched everything unfold from the classroom.\"\nMonica Hall, an 18-year-old Umqua Community College student, said she was standing outside a campus building when she thought she heard a car backfiring or shots from the start of hunting season.\nThen, she said, someone told her and other students to get inside the building. There, they waited in a classroom, with CNN on a projector. Someone else was listening to a police scanner.\n\"It was pretty overwhelming,'' Hall said. \"I felt like the rest of the country knew what was going on before we did.''\nJohn Blackwood, a computer information systems professor, was teaching a class when a student pointed out that an active shooter alert had been sent out through the email system.\n\"I was stunned and stared at it a moment,\" Blackwood said. The class huddled in the middle of the room until police with AR-15s escorted them out with their hands up, he said.\nBlackwood later addressed the crowd at the vigil: \"We know this is not going to be our defining moment. We will not be terrified by these types of people.''\n-- Carli Brosseau, Maxine Bernstein and Ian Kullgren\ncbrosseau@oregonian.com\n503-294-5121; @carlibrosseau", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/carlibrosseau", "http://www.cityofroseburg.org/departments/parks/park/"], "published": "2015-10-02T07:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:15:41.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
