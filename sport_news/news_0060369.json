(UT Sports) -- Tennessee head coach Butch Jones, Alvin Kamara and Kyler Kerbyson spoke to reporters on Wednesday at 12:15 p.m. in the Ray and Lucy Hand Digital Studio. \nWatch the full video here: \n(Opening Statement)\"Good afternoon. Good to see everyone. Before we get started, I'd like to say that our thoughts and prayers are with Coach Graham Clark of Dobyns-Bennett with the tragedy that his family's going through right now. I know he's meant so much Malik (Foreman), Thomas (Edwards), and Devaun (Swafford) on our football team. Life is very fragile, and it puts things into perspective. I'd like to let him know that we're thinking about him and his family in moving forward. \n\"In terms of Alabama, as the week progresses, [they are] a very, very difficult football team to prepare for, a football team that has great depth. They challenge you in terms of scout teams. You really don't have the luxury of going scout teams [in practice]. All of our younger players are participating, so we've had to break up practice, have more like an NFL-type practice - with one's versus two's and two's versus one's. \n\"When you look at a complete football team, that's what they are. I think they really resemble the difference of building a football team and building a football program that has stood the test of time. They're very well coached. When you look at them defensively, [they have] seven seniors, three juniors, and only one true freshman playing. Offensively, four seniors, four juniors, two sophomores, and one redshirt freshman. They have great depth across the board. It's going to be a great challenge, but I know our players are looking forward to the opportunity to compete in this great game and what it brings about. \n\"We're still fighting the injury bug a little bit. I'll know more, in terms of a lot of these injuries, come tomorrow and Friday, but that's where we're at in our football program. I have really been impressed and I appreciate our players with the resiliency. One individual goes down, the next individual is ready to go. I think that speaks of our character, and I think you'd be hard pressed with the amount of injuries we've had this year that would rival anyone in the country. I think our players have done a great job. They've shown great resiliency, and we're looking forward to getting the second half of the season started here very soon.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:00:37.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
