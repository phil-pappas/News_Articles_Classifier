You know, we didn't play well last year, so we're really anxious to step out on the floor and just prove to our community and the people that are by our sides that we have grown, grown a lot since this time last year.\"D.J. Fenner said he's also ready to hit the hardwood.\"We're ready to play,\" the junior guard said. \"I think it's just been a long offseason. I think it's been going on for five months. Everyday, we've been here, nearly the whole summer, and we're just ready to play somebody else, instead of each other at practice everyday.\"Nevada will host its first game of the season at Lawlor Events Center on Oct. 30 in an exhibition against Dominican University of California.
