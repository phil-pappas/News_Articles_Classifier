Lost to Montreal Canadiens in Eastern Conference quarterfinals. \nCOACH: Dave Cameron, one NHL season, 32-15-8. \nADDED: G Matt O’Connor, C Eric O’Dell, D Michael Kostka. \nLOST: RW Erik Condra, D Eric Gryba, C David Legwand, G Robin Lehner \nPLAYER TO WATCH: Bobby Ryan. When the Senators traded for Ryan in July 2013, they added offensive production but he has not developed into a dynamic, game-breaking goal scorer. Ryan has scored 41 goals in 148 regular season games as a Senator. He has also recorded 61 assists. \nOUTLOOK: Are the Senators the team that lost 16 of their first 27 games, leading to the firing of Paul MacLean? Or are they the squad that won 32 of their final 55 games under Dave Cameron to qualify for the Eastern Conference playoffs as the seventh seed? If the Senators are the latter, is it possible for them to again reach the playoffs without making any significant additions. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:38:04.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
