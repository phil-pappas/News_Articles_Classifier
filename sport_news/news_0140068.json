He was sitting and conducting an interview with Russian media. To his left, teammate Artem Anisimov had a smirk and an idea. First, he blocked the camera with his head. Then, he pulled gently on the blond wisps of a beard forming on Panarin’s chin.\nSuch is life for the next rookie sensation.

Playing for St. Petersburg, Panarian scored 26 goals and had 36 assists last year in 62 games. In 20 postseason games, he scored 20 points. In the regular season, he outscored his teammate, former NHL star Ilya Kovalchuk.\n“I think he can be an All-Star in the NHL,” Tikhonov said.\nNHL Video Women of NWHL ready to make history as season begins by Michael Blinn", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:28:38.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
