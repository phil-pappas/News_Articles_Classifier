I am going to play to just help my team first of all.\" \nArlauskis was in jovial mood at the start of the pre-match press conference, welcoming English journalists to this \"basketball country\", but the mood soon turned. \nThe goalkeeper reacted angrily to local journalists' questions about the Lithuanian Football Federation and its selection policies. \n\"We don't need to translate,\" Arlauskis said, before having a slanging match with a reporter as he left the press conference. \n\"It is about what is happening inside - shame on our journalists. \n\"We have a nice country, nice football, professional people, just it is not for you guys (in the English media). It is for our journalists.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:02:04.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
