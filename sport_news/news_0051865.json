The Dodgers are 3-6 in those games, having now lost five consecutive Kershaw playoff starts.\nThe numbers are remarkable really, among the most unlikely statistics accumulated by a pitcher famous for producing unlikely statistics. Kershaw, in October, has become a splintered ace.\nSome of his nine postseason starts have been very good, a couple of them have been very bad and a few, like this latest one, have fallen somewhere in between.\nAgainst the Mets, he permitted only Daniel Murphy’s homer leading off the fourth before three walks unraveled his seventh inning, leading to the Mets’ other two runs.\nManager Don Mattingly pulled Kershaw with the bases loaded and the score still only 1-0 with two outs in that seventh.\nReliever Pedro Baez immediately fell behind David Wright, the most veteran of New York’s hitters, and eventually surrendered Wright’s game-clinching two-run single, and maybe you’ve read before about the Dodgers’ bullpen failing in these sorts of situations.\nSome folks will question Mattingly’s decision to remove Kershaw, who, to that point, had thrown 113 pitches. After all, questioning Mattingly has become one of the great postseason traditions in Dodger history.\nBut I’m not going to do that here, given how Kershaw was struggling to find the strike zone. I would, however, wonder about Mattingly’s choice of Baez over, say, Chris Hatcher. I’d also note that more than Mattingly, Baez was the one who really failed.\nKershaw had spent stretches of this night making New York’s hitters look silly, repeatedly striking them out with curveballs that short-hopped catcher A.J. Ellis.\nThe Mets batted .155 against left-handed curveballs this season, which was the worst in baseball and another sign this sport one day will be rendered less thrilling than long division.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:27:31.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
