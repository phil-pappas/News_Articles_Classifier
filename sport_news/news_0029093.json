Luv Ranjan treads the same ground, only looks at the world strictly from a man’s point of view. Love kills…we all know that but from Ranjan’s perspective the statutory warning holds true only for male of the species. So, if you are a feminist and can’t take a few, sorry larder full of jokes, at the expense of the fair sex, exit right now. For this tale of three nice looking guys (Kartik Aryan, Sunny Singh and Omkar Kapoor) and three pretty young things is anything but balanced wholesome take on man- woman relationships. Skewed yes, but not outlandish either. Even if you are a woman you can certainly identify with the defining characteristics of the gals out here. Let’s face it and admit men too are taken for a ride. Sure, the girls in Ranjan’s world are cut in a stereotypical mould. Kusum (Ishita Raj), who always talks of going Dutch, is a manipulative gold digger deep beneath. Supriya (Sonnalli Seygall) is strangely diffident about telling her parents about her beau even though the guy has noble intentions of marrying her right from the first moment. And the third one Chiku (Nushrat Bharucha) is really the bimbo type (well played though) surrounded by more of her sorts. Expectedly as they enter into the lives of these decent blokes with decent enough jobs they spell not just heartburn but problems galore. There are some genuinely funny lines and laughs and one odd monologue even brings the house down. There is certainly some clever writing at play with references to Sooraj Barjatya and his unforgettable song Didi tera devar deewana playing out as the ring tone are amusing enough. Then the cautionary take on the hazards of love drawing from the anti-smoking campaign close to the intermission is truly hilarious. Then where is the problem? Well, in the telling of the travails of these three men, though each one faces a different problem with his respective lady love, the recounting of differences gets repetitive. And if you have seen the prequel you might find it even more so. However, two fresh faces Omkar Kapoor and particularly Sunny Singh enhance the sunny side up. Then actors like Kartik Aryan and others who appeared in the previous outing do a fairly convincing job of etching out their sassy parts too. Of course, compared to the girls, boys are treated with greater empathy. Male buddyhood too is fleshed out better. But to suggest men want women only for one reason, biological at that, is doing them a great disservice. Besides, though the film brings out their bewilderment while dealing with the other sex rather well, unlike Gray’s book it doesn’t hold any key to the complicated relationship matrix. Except perhaps that men can’t live with women and can’t live without them either…. Why? No one knows the answer to this query…so don’t expect the film to answer it for you. With a fair share of fun moments, though the funny bone of young men is likely to be tickled more this one is watchable fare for sure. Unless you are of the hypersensitive variety who analyses too much and takes offence easily!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:41:06.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
