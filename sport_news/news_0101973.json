Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports \nBrendan Steele shot a three-under 69 to remain top of the leaderboard after the third round of the Frys.com Open on Saturday, while world number three Rory McIlroy endured another mediocre day on the greens to slide out of contention. \nSteele, on 14-under-par, holds a one-shot lead over fellow Americans Andrew Loupe (63) and Kevin Na (64) at the Silverado Resort in northern California, with world number seven Justin Rose (68) among a group of eight two shots back. \nMcIlroy, who carded a 71 to sit eight shots off the lead, had a narrow escape when he was almost struck by Argentine Emiliano Grillo's tee shot. \nThe Northern Irishman had just played a chip shot from next to the green at the driveable par-four 17th when Grillo's drive landed only a couple of feet from the surprised McIlroy, who clearly received no warning that he was in danger of being hit. \n(Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Peter Rutherford ) \nOur top photos from the past week.
