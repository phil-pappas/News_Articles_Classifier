Andrew Cuomo and will focus on wage theft and unsafe work conditions, and specifically on industries in which workers may fear reporting exploitation because of the risk of retaliation.\nAlphonso David, counsel to the Democratic governor, will lead Wednesday's meeting, which is scheduled for 10 a.m. in New York City.\nCuomo announced the task force earlier this year after allegations of exploitation at nail salons. He said the state would not tolerate abuses by employers in any industry.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:31:11.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
