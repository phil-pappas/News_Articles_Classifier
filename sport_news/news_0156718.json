The Clippers' second-stringers were spotty for a second consecutive game, combining for 27 points on 10-for-34 shooting while commiting 18 turnovers.\nKyle Lowry was a whirlwind of activity for the Raptors, finishing with 26 points on seven-for-10 shooting in only 21 minutes.\nJ.J. Redick couldn't sustain his strong start for the Clippers, with 13 of his 15 points coming in the first half. Griffin finished with 14 points while Jamal Crawford and Josh Smith each had six points to lead the reserves, though Crawford had seven turnovers.\nClippers swingman Lance Stephenson's early struggles continued as he went scoreless, missing all four shots. He has now made two of 14 shots in two exhibition games.\nGriffin dunked so hard in warmups he caused the shot clock to dislodge from its supports and fall backward.\nFans cheered for the Clippers during player introductions but did not remain so friendly once forward Paul Pierce checked into the game, showering him with boos. There was a reason, of course. Pierce had helped the Washington Wizards complete a first-round sweep of the Raptors before signing with the Clippers.\nThe Clippers somehow remained within striking distance at halftime, trailing by only six points, 40-34, despite Griffin and Paul having combined to make two of 12 shots and the Clippers' reserves having accumulated eight turnovers, seven fouls and only six points on three-for-13 shooting.\nThen the Raptors started to pull away in the third quarter.\nThe Clippers now return to Los Angeles before departing Wednesday for a trip to China that will include stops in Shenzhen and Shanghai for exhibitions games against the Charlotte Hornets.\n(c)2015 Los Angeles Times\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1732598&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1732598&h=Clippers+drop+exhibition+game%2C+93%2D73%2C+to+Raptors", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1732598"], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:11:39.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
