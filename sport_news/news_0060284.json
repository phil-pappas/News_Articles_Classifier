Kaye scored on runs of 4, 31 and 6 yards in the quarter, as the Vikings turned a 21-7 halftime advantage into a 35-14 lead. Kaye also had a 13-yard scoring run in the second quarter.\nThe 5-foot-6, 140-pound Kaye opened the third with a 38-yard run and added non-scoring runs 47 and 18 yards later in the quarter. The Vikings racked up 410 yards rushing and 106 passing.\nPrep football: No. 19 Huntley hands Jacobs first loss Phil English Anthony Binetti, redemption is yours.\nShaking off what may have been his worst three quarters of high-school football, Huntley's senior quarterback led a 13-play, 65-yard scoring drive to put his team ahead by two scores.\nBinetti capped the possession with a 6-yard keeper to help the No. 19 Red...\nAnthony Binetti, redemption is yours.\nShaking off what may have been his worst three quarters of high-school football, Huntley's senior quarterback led a 13-play, 65-yard scoring drive to put his team ahead by two scores.\nBinetti capped the possession with a 6-yard keeper to help the No. 19 Red...\n(Phil English) \"We had to have somebody step up,\" Kaye said.\nThe Vikings' defense struggled in last week's 26-17 loss against Conant last week but allowed only 67 rushing yards and forced five straight punts after the Pirates scored on their opening drive. Fremd's defense had two sacks and one interception to hold the Pirates (4-2, 1-1) to their lowest score of the season.\nBob Narang is a freelance reporter for the Chicago Tribune.\nPlayer of the game: Charlie Kaye, Fremd, 25 carries, 250 yards, 4 TDs.\nKey performers: Fremd — Kenney Lyke, 11 carries, 64 yards; Tom Josten, 9-for-14 passing, 106 yards.
