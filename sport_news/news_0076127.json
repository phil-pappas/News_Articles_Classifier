(Photo: Bob Donnan-USA TODAY Sports)\n2 CONNECT 10 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE For our preseason power rankings, we're breaking down each team by focusing on the X factor to their success.\n1. Golden State Warriors: The defending champions are heading into this season looking as dominant as they did last season. However, in order to defend their title in the dangerous West, Stephen Curry and company can’t lose a step.\n2. Cleveland Cavaliers: Once again led by the best player on the planet, the Cavaliers figure to be around in late May. But contrary to popular belief, LeBron James can’t do it all. Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love have to be in top form if the Cavs want a spot in the Finals.\nUSA TODAY\nNBA A to Z podcast: Western Conference preview\n3. San Antonio Spurs: As if the most dominant team of the past 20 years wasn’t good enough … adding LaMarcus Aldridge to accompany future Hall of Famer Tim Duncan in the frontcourt will be a nightmare for the NBA’s other teams. Nothing suggests that Aldridge and Duncan won’t mesh perfectly in the Gregg Popovich scheme, but it’s something to keep an eye on.\n4. Houston Rockets: With James Harden expected to continue playing the best basketball of his life, it’s essential for Ty Lawson and Dwight Howard to play at their full potential to give the Rockets a shot at a title.\n5. Los Angeles Clippers: With the best offense in the league behind the Warriors, the Clippers must put in equal effort on the defensive side of the ball if they want to finally push past the Western Conference semifinals.\n6. Memphis Grizzlies: Memphis has been in the playoff mix for the past five seasons and figures to be there again. Acquiring Matt Barnes and Brandan Wright provides a boost, but the Grizzlies’ offensive productivity must increase in order to compete with the top dogs of the conference.\nUSA TODAY\nNBA Western Conference Preview\n7. Oklahoma City Thunder: With Kevin Durant and Serge Ibaka back to full health, the Thunder are the team to watch in the West after failing to make the postseason last season. They undoubtedly have the talent, but can Durant and Russell Westbrook stay healthy, share the basketball and carry the Thunder back to the top?\n8. Atlanta Hawks: They’ll surely miss DeMarre Carroll at small forward, but as long as Jeff Teague, Kyle Korver, Paul Millsap and Al Horford produce close to the same level as last season, the Hawks can go ahead and book their tickets to the postseason.\n9. New Orleans Pelicans: As long as Ryan Anderson, Eric Gordon and Jrue Holiday can stay healthy (they failed to do so last season), superstar center Anthony Davis can lead his team to the postseason again.\n10. Chicago Bulls: Fred Hoiberg is taking over one of the most talented teams in the league, but for the Bulls to have a legitimate shot at postseason success, he needs to quickly prove his worth at the professional level. More important, Derrick Rose needs to find a way to stay healthy and on the court.\nUSA TODAY\nNBA A to Z podcast: Is Eastern Conference the Cavaliers' to lose?\n11. Toronto Raptors: Their depth will feel the negatives after parting with Greivis Vasquez and sixth man of the year Lou Williams, but stealing DeMarre Carroll from the Hawks will pay dividends.\n12. Washington Wizards: With Paul Pierce now in Los Angeles, it’s up to third-year small forward Otto Porter to be a productive part of a young, athletic squad led by John Wall and Bradley Beal.\n13. Milwaukee Bucks: The Bucks are stronger than last season after the addition of Greg Monroe, combined with a healthy Jabari Parker, a well-paid Khris Middleton and a lengthy duo of Michael Carter-Williams and Giannis Antetokounmpo. With all of the starters younger than 25 and a coach who was playing two seasons ago, the Bucks need to continue to mature as a team in order to continue to succeed as a team.\n14. Miami Heat: They figure to be much stronger than last season with a healthy Chris Bosh, a matured Hassan Whiteside and a more familiarized Goran Dragic. Bosh and Dwyane Wade have to remain injury-free.\nUSA TODAY\nNBA A to Z podcast: Surprise teams and David West interview\n15. Dallas Mavericks: With a future Hall of Famer on the floor and one of the greatest minds in basketball on the sideline (Rick Carlisle), the question the Mavs must answer is whether they have enough other pieces to earn a spot in the playoffs? An efficient Chandler Parsons and healthy Wesley Matthews might be able to provide the answers.\n16. Utah Jazz: Statistically the best defense in the league, the Jazz look to build on the 19-10 record they posted after the All-Star break last season. Next step: offense.\n17. Boston Celtics: Brad Stevens proved he belongs in the NBA after leading the Celtics to a seventh seed last season. The additions of David Lee and Amir Johnson has them heading into this season with all eyes on the playoffs — assuming they provide the veteran leadership they’re capable of.\n18. Indiana Pacers: To finish better than .500, two things need to happen for the Pacers. Paul George must become comfortable with his new role as a power forward and they need to find some sort of production from big guys Ian Mahinmi, Lavoy Allen, Jordan Hill and Rakeem Christmas.\n19. Phoenix Suns: If the young backcourt of Eric Bledsoe and Brandon Knight can keep up production, the other pieces will fit together to keep the Suns in the mix for a postseason bid.\n20. Charlotte Hornets: A lot of new roster components make the Hornets an intriguing team this season. But can adding a few new faces do enough for a team that ranked 29th in the league in field goal percentage last season?\nUSA TODAY\nNBA Eastern Conference preview: If healthy, Cavs favored\n21. Detroit Pistons: Stan Van Gundy’s second term in Detroit doesn’t figure to be much better than the last, but if the youth — Reggie Jackson, Stanley Johnson and Andre Drummond — play at a high level, the Pistons could have bright spots.\n22. Sacramento Kings: If DeMarcus Cousins and Rajon Rondo can coexist with the front office, the Kings have enough talent to finish much better than the 29-53 mark they put up last season.\n23. Brooklyn Nets: Don’t expect Brooklyn to have the same fate it did last season after sneaking into the playoffs with an eighth seed. Unless one of the few young players on the roster steps into a primary role, the future looks bleak for the Nets.\n24. Portland Trail Blazers: After earning the fourth overall seed last season, the Blazers completely remodeled their roster — backward. Damian Lillard is the only returning starter. Expect him to lead the league in minutes and field goal attempts as he tries to carry an entire city on his shoulders.\n25. Orlando Magic: Victor Oladipo, Elfrid Payton, Nikola Vucevic and Tobias Harris all are under age 25. They also all figure to be in the starting lineup. It’s not playoff time in Orlando, but there might just be a light at the end of the tunnel.\n26. New York Knicks: Will Kristaps Porzingis prove himself as a deserving fourth overall pick? Will Carmelo Anthony play a full, injury-free season? Will Phil Jackson’s triangle shape up in New York? Even if all three turn out to be yes, the Knicks’ season will end after Game 82 again.\nUSA TODAY\nNBA, players' union have high hopes for continued labor peace\n27. Denver Nuggets: A rookie head coach (Michael Malone) combined with a rookie point guard could either be a pleasant surprise or an unsightly disaster. It probably will be the latter, but young Emmanuel Mudiay without a doubt is the future of the Nuggets.\n28. Los Angeles Lakers: Will this be the Black Mamba’s last run? Will young guards D’Angelo Russell and Jordan Clarkson soak up the overabundance of knowledge he has to offer? Only Father Time can determine when Kobe Bryant will hang up his jersey, but you can be certain he won’t finish his career with a 21-win season like the Lakers posted last year.\n29. Minnesota Timberwolves: Rookie of the year Andrew Wiggins will team up with rookie of the year favorite Karl-Anthony Towns to create an electrifying young duo. They’ll still be near the bottom this season, but the T’Wolves have two franchise players who are 20 and 19 years old, respectively.\n30. Philadelphia 76ers: Another team that has impressive young pieces but needs time — and a little bit of good fortune — to climb out of the bottom of the league. Yet another year to rebuild in Philly.\nVoters: USA TODAY Sports’ Sam Amick, Jeff Zillgitt and Kevin Spain; USA TODAY Sports Weekly’s Howard Megdal; HoopsHype.com’s Jorge Serra and Raul Barrigon.\n2 CONNECT 10 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4a040fb53a72bceab9dc8bdbc00446d50dd55f0d/r=300/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4560041750001_video-still-for-video-4560003743001.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/677c3b8e0658c38a39e4eeb474fbcb4c07b6641b/c=0-61-3041-1779&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/10/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635804136816248916-USP-NBA--Miami-Heat-at-New-Orleans-Pelicans.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1S3WOx4&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/322bb5b7df172f84dd25dc204c7e9073355a4588/r=500x358/local/-/media/2015/10/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635813043508860896-USP-NBA--Playoffs-Golden-State-Warriors-at-Clevela.1.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d3ce3c2a4c125a1b478800633770da1c428d6b57/c=973-136-4244-1984&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812210864062918-2015-10-23-Adam-Silver.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1S3WOx4&text=NBA%20power%20rankings%3A%20Finalists%20at%20top%20until%20they%20get%20knocked%20off&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635813043508860896-USP-NBA--Playoffs-Golden-State-Warriors-at-Clevela.1.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cd9058fc0e8143400d9d05bb39c6d08ec0dd08b2/c=70-0-2983-2190&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/24/USATODAY/USATODAY/635813043508860896-USP-NBA--Playoffs-Golden-State-Warriors-at-Clevela.1.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4a040fb53a72bceab9dc8bdbc00446d50dd55f0d/r=300/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4555845871001_video-still-for-video-4553078974001.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ed5cc02511c4b134209457a69dd0b62c060ac869/c=491-0-2681-2190/local/-/media/2015/09/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/635781896140653936-USP-NBA--Playoffs-Golden-State-Warriors-at-Clevela.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1022470c07f88b99d0b47c212e506708b9885c0d/c=0-158-2227-2385/local/-/media/2015/09/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/635784294286411224-AP-Cavaliers-Bulls-Basketball.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-25T13:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:05:11.061+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
