Tanaka has been pitching with a partial tear in the ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow, an injury most experts believed would need Tommy John surgery eventually.\nThe injury dates back to his pitching career in Japan, according to the Yankees, who expect him to be ready for the start of spring training. The expected recovery time is six weeks.\n@Yankees @MLB bone spurs are tough to pitch through. Much respect Tanaka.üëäüèæ\n‚Äî Chris Archer (@ChrisArcher42) October 20, 2015 \n\n  Filed under masahiro tanaka ,  new york yankees", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:30:20.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
