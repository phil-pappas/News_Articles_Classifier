But Virginia Beach teams helped get things back on track last year by winning two of three state titles. Cox beat First Colonial 1-0 to win the Group 6A crown, while Princess Anne beat Mountain View 2-1 in the 5A championship game. On top of that, Norfolk Academy won its first private school state title with a 1-0 overtime victory over Trinity.\n50-50 proposition\nFirst Colonial senior Haley Schleicher last season became the first high school player to join the national 50-50 club, finishing with 52 goals and 52 assists. The Duke commit nearly accomplished the feat as a sophomore (47 goals, 50 assists). Schleicher is poised to become the leading career scorer in Virginia history. She is fourth all-time with 139 goals – 21 behind former Cox standout Kim Miller. Schleicher’s career total of 151 assists already is a national record.\nNew digs\nA season after hoisting its first state title trophy, Norfolk Academy will break in a new on-campus astroturf field. Bulldogs Associate AD Chad Byler said only one other high school in the country has a similar facility that features automatic water cannons that can pump out 320 gallons of water a minute and can be controlled with a cellular phone. At Norfolk Collegiate, the Oaks also are preparing to play on a new synthetic surface after work is completed on the school’s revamped fields and lights.\nReaching goals\nCox, First Colonial and Princess Anne were three of the most dominating teams in the state. First Colonial finished with a 141-13 advantage in goals. Cox outscored opponents 118-15 and Princess Anne had a 100-10 edge. This year’s results are likely to be the same.\nSome of the best\nSouth Hampton Roads’ three powerhouses have won a combined 24 state titles since 1977. Cox leads with a state record 18 crowns. Princess Anne has four and First Colonial has two. The trio has 10 runner-up finishes combined. And just for measure, Tabb — which competed in the Group AA/A tournament before the state reclassified, and now competes in 4A — has won a combined six state titles.\n___\nTOP 10 TEAMS IN SOUTH HAMPTON ROADS\n1. Cox\nThe defending Group 6A state champions are ranked third in the country in the MaxFieldHockey.com preseason poll after finishing last year at 21-2.\n2. First Colonial\nThe defending 6A South Region and state runner-up Patriots are ranked eighth nationally after a 20-3 season — with all three losses at the hands of the Falcons.\n3. Princess Anne\nThe Cavaliers finished last year 22-1-1, losing only to First Colonial and tying Norfolk Academy in the first three games of the season. PA is on a 21-game winning streak.\n4.

Norfolk Academy\nThe Bulldogs finished 14-5-1 last season, but still captured the school’s first VISAA state title (Div. I). The program now will have a decided homefield edge with its new astroturf complex.\n6. Maury\nThe Commodores have been competitive since Day One and there’s no reason to think things will change.

At Great Bridge , Reyton Tollaksen led the team in scoring last season as a freshman and earned first-team all-conference honors.\nIn Group 3A ...\nDespite a 9-10 season, coaches recognized the talent of Lakeland senior Stasha Waterfield and awarded her a second-team all-state honor.\nIn private schools ...\nAfter graduating its all-time leading scorer, Cape Henry was hoping to lean on the stick of U-17 National Team member Charlotte DeVries.
