When police arrived, Captain Blaine Larson said officers found 21-year-old David Randle, Jr., and another man giving first aid to Mikael Mengitsu Ashame. He suffered a gunshot wound to the leg and died at the scene. \nLarson said most of the people inside the apartment ran off and took multiple firearms along with them. Through their investigation with witnesses, police believe Randle was handling a rifle when it was dropped and misfired. Alcohol and marijuana use appear to be a factor in the incident. Police later found the firearm in northwest Sioux Falls. \nPrevious Story: Man Dies In Sioux Falls Shooting \nRandle was arrested and charged with first-degree manslaughter. Back on October 14, Randle was released on bond for felony charges related to a June 2015 shooting . Larson said he has been fairly cooperative during the investigation. \nThe owner of the gun, 19-year-old Mason Mitzel, was later found in Brandon. Larson said officers found his vehicle outside of an acquaintance's house, where he barricaded himself in a basement for about 30 minutes. When officers searched his vehicle, they found eight pounds of marijuana in brick form, 81 containers of hash oil, and a large sum of cash. \nMitzel is charged with three counts of possession of a controlled substance, possession with the intent to distribute, possession of marijuana and violation of a drug-free zone.
