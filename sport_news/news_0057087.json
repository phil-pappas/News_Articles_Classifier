(AP) — Tennessee Titans right guard Chance Warmack does not know if he will be able to play Sunday against the Buffalo Bills. \nThe Titans (1-2) listed Warmack as questionable Friday after the guard was limited in practice all week as he works to return from a sprained MCL in his right knee hurt against the Cleveland Browns on Sept. 20. He missed the Titans’ 35-33 loss to Indianapolis on Sept. 27 but has hoped he could play against the Bills with the team coming off its bye. \n“I’m just taking it day by day and trying to do what the trainers are telling me, and I’ll go from there,” Warmack said. “Anybody can tell you in this game that you’re never going to be 100 percent. I have to be able to execute on every play’s that’s going to be called, and in order for that to happen, I’ll just have to evaluate it every day.” \nWarmack said his knee has improved quite a bit over the past week. \n“I’m definitely happy that everything is going the way it’s going. It could have been a lot worse. I’m blessed and just staying positive,” Warmack said. \nVeteran Jamon Meredith, who started in Warmack’s place against the Colts, likely would start if Warmack can’t play Sunday. \nCoach Ken Whisenhunt said nose tackle Sammie Hill will not play. He was limited in practice Wednesday and Thursday in his return from right knee surgery Sept. 2 but did not practice Friday. Cornerback Cody Riggs, who had practiced fully on Wednesday and Thursday after missing two games with a knee injury, was not in the open part of practice Friday. He practiced in a limited fashion and was listed as questionable. \nCornerback Jason McCourty, who missed the entire preseason and three regular season games with a groin injury, practiced fully all week and is expected to make his first start this season against the Bills. \n___ \nAP NFL websites: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:41:12.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
