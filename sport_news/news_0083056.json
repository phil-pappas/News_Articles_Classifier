Are any of you worried?\nOf course not. Just keep the Tums handy while watching the Patriots roll to a 73-0 victory over those dime-dropping Colts. It’s going to be “Game of Thrones: Special Football Edition.”\nBut what if the unthinkable happens? And by “unthinkable” we’re not talking about an Indianapolis victory. Even the Colts’ cheerleaders aren’t going there. Upsets of that magnitude simply don’t happen, unless you’re talking about the Amazin’ Mets of 1969, our American college boys at Lake Placid in 1980, or Teddy Kennedy’s unanimous decision over Mitt “I Don’t Know” Romney in their infamous 1994 senatorial debate.\nIn this here case, the “unthinkable” is a Patriots victory over the Colts that does not include the words “slaughter,” “humiliation” or “annihilation.”\nYou know, just a garden-variety victory by a garden-variety score. 28-17. 22-10. 31-24.\nThere’s been talk that anything less than a 40-point spread will be a moral victory for the Colts, and that it’ll make for a restless night for Pats fans. All last week, you’ll recall, there was so much run-it-up hollering going on that it was though picking a grotesquely one-sided score was some kind of test of your Patriots fanhood.\nThis was an actual topic of conversation the other night on Comcast SportsNet New England. And Greg Dickerson, who has sadly become merely the second most famous native of Milford now that Chris Colabello has made it to the American League Championship Series with the Toronto Blue Jays, led the charge in observing that it’ll be a cranky week around here if it’s not global thermonuclear devastation tonight for the Pats.\nTrust me: In the event tonight’s outcome is a tad closer than anyone expected, and assuming there’s no injury suffered by one of our hometown heroes, there won’t be an ounce of regret around here.\nLet’s call it The Bill Belichick Effect. The man has been the Pats coach for 16 seasons now, and among the things we have learned about him are:\n•     He owns the special, commemorative, boxed-set DVD edition of “My Cousin Vinny.”\n•     He knows less than Queen Elizabeth about social media.\n•     He has zero interest in last week’s game, or the game that’s going to be played in a couple of weeks. His primary focus, always, is “the next game on the schedule.”\nConsider what happened in 2005 when the Patriots landed in Jacksonville to begin the weeklong run-up to Super Bowl XXXIX. The Patriots were defending Super Bowl champions, having emerged with a 32-29 victory over the Carolina Panthers a year earlier, yet Belichick, upon arriving in Jacksonville, refused to pose for a photo with the Lombardi Trophy.\nI’m guessing he saw it this way: The Lombardi Trophy earned a year earlier at Houston’s Reliant Stadium was now sitting on the mantelpiece in Robert Kraft’s living room, whereas this edition of the Lombardi Trophy was still to be earned. So he walked away, like Vito Corleone refusing to be in the wedding picture without Michael.\nBelichick’s players have learned this lesson well. Several years ago, I asked then-Patriot Rosevelt Colvin about what it was going to be like later in the season to return to his native Indianapolis to play the Colts. (As a teenager, Colvin had been a popcorn vendor at the old RCA Dome.) But because the Colts were not the next game on the schedule, he had no interest in going there about going home.\nYet as soon as Pats-Colts did become the next game on the schedule, Colvin happily talked about his beloved Indy.\nPats fans, like Colvin, have learned this lesson well. What will happen, then, is that tomorrow will be a day for all kinds of dissection and analysis about tonight’s Pats-Colts game. Tuesday will be a combination of Sunday leftovers, some jibber-jabber about the baseball playoffs, and the first morsels of discussion about the next game on the schedule.\nAnd the next game on the schedule — Sunday, 1 p.m., Gillette Stadium — is the New York Jets.\nEveryone hates the Jets, and nobody hates them more than Belichick. Even if they no longer have Bill Parcells, Eric Mangini or Rex Ryan, the Jets are still the Jets — and that’s a big deal around here.\nBut only when they’re the next game on the schedule, which they will be by the close of business tonight.\nAnd by Wednesday, nobody around here will care what the score of the Colts game was.\nBut, yeah, 73-0 sounds about right.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:44:46.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
