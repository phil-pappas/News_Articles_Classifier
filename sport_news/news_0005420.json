He threw for 398 yards — with a school record 416 yards of total offense — and his wideouts all made difficult plays.\n• The kicking game is not hopeless: An early botched field-goal try was the only real issue of the day, and the Spartans got deep kickoffs, good coverage, a forced and recovered fumble, a Michael Geiger make, a solid day from punter Jake Hartbarger and a big return from R.J. Shelton. It was the best day of the season.\n• The Spartans can adjust on defense: Through 35 minutes, it looked like Indiana was going to pass, move the ball and score at will. The Hoosiers didn't do any of the three in the final 25 minutes. MSU players talked after the game about energy simply increasing, but coordinators Harlon Barnett and Mike Tressel also figured some ways to unleash the pass rush.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nWeary Spartans won't practice during bye week\nUp next for the Spartans: Nebraska\nMatchup: No. 6 Michigan State (8-0, 4-0 Big Ten) at Nebraska (3-5, 1-3).\nWhen: 7 p.m., Saturday Nov. 7.\nWhere: Memorial Stadium, Lincoln, Neb.\nTV/radio: TV TBA, WJR-AM (760).\nLine: No line.\nKnow the foe: A nightmare debut season for head coach Mike Riley continued Saturday with a 30-28 home loss to Northwestern, dropping the Cornhuskers to 3-5 overall and 1-3 in the Big Ten. Those five losses have come by a total of 13 points, and all have been heartbreakers to varying degrees — starting with a home loss to BYU in the season opener on a Hail Mary. Tommy Armstrong Jr. is a talented quarterback who still makes the occasional costly mistake, and he isn't getting much help from the running game. Nebraska is talented up front but inconsistent on defense.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nRexrode: MSU learns to make adjustments, trust its defense\nThree things to watch\n• A Mark Dantonio first: The MSU coach has always conducted at least one practice during an off week, to keep things sharp and start moving toward the next game. Not this week. MSU's players will lift and run, but Dantonio doesn't want to risk any more injuries by practicing. The Spartans need a break, badly.\n• Running back rotation: It's anyone's guess how MSU's running back situation will play out from here. LJ Scott has not taken over the main role as appeared likely a few weeks ago. Gerald Holmes is surging. Delton Williams looks rusty. Madre London is expected back at some point. And MSU isn't running it well overall.\n• Offensive line intact? One possible answer for the Spartans' recent rushing struggles is the absence of the leader of its offensive line, All-America center Jack Allen (ankle). MSU expects him back for the next game, Nov. 7 at Nebraska, and that would mean all starters playing together for the first time since early in the season's second game against Oregon.\nContact Joe Rexrode: jrexrode@freepress.com.
