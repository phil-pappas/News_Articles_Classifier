The showdown between Buffalo’s dominant defensive front and the Giants’ offensive line was billed as a gridiron train wreck of epic proportions.\nAnd that expectation was not without reason and context, considering the Bills entered with more sacks than any team over the past two seasons and the Giants with a reputation of being, at best, a work-in-progress.\nWhat transpired was indeed a mismatch on the scoreboard, only not the one many anticipated.\nThe Giants held their own up front and made a statement in the process.\n\"We were called worst offensive line in the league coming into last year, this year, too,\" Giants left guard Justin Pugh said after Sunday’s 24-10 victory over the Bills. \"Just keep proving we’re not.\"\nThe performance was not without its flaws, of course, but in the end, the Giants headed out of Ralph Wilson Stadium for home with plenty of confidence in how they’ve recovered from the wrong side of history over the season’s first two weeks.\nWith the Cowboys losing in overtime to the Saints late Sunday night, the Giants have gone from the basement of the NFC East to a three-way first-place deadlock.\nBy the time they take the field for their next game Sunday night against San Francisco (1-3) at MetLife Stadium, the Giants could be playing for sole possession of first, especially with the Cowboys and Redskins readying to face undefeated teams New England and Atlanta, respectively.\n\"The win [against Buffalo] made us relevant again,\" Giants center Weston Richburg said. \"We never took ourselves out of the race. It’s just a testament to how hard we work and we just kept going [Sunday]. It was cool to see. It was a great win for us and now we’ve just got to keep chopping at the wood.\"\nThe Giants have given up four sacks in four games, including one against the Bills, and that was by safety Corey Graham, who came through on a blitz.\nBuffalo Hall of Fame defensive end Bruce Smith has called the franchise’s current defensive line — ends Jerry Hughes and Mario Williams and tackles Marcell Dareus and Kyle Williams – its best-ever line, including those headlined by Smith that reached four consecutive Super Bowls in the 1990s.\nThe Giants won a pair of Super Bowls with a defensive line feared by the opposition, so they are plenty familiar with the blueprint that was used against them to neutralize their ability to get after quarterbacks.\n\"Get the ball out quick, don’t give ’em time to get to our quarterback, leave them frustrated,\" Pugh said, \"and that’s what we did.\"\nRookie left tackle Ereck Flowers has earned the respect and the trust of Tom Coughlin by refusing to let an ankle injury keep him off the field Sunday.\nOne play into the game, Flowers’ ankle got rolled up on during a Rashad Jennings run. He came limping off and appeared to be in agony on the bench. Pugh moved to left tackle and John Jerry was inserted at left guard.\nFlowers missed just 10 snaps, re-entering the game and finishing it out.\n\"He walked through the door knowing he was not going to subscribe to the scholarship mentality [of taking his time as a rookie before making an impact],\" former Giants linebacker and Super Bowl champion Carl Banks told WFAN-AM on Monday. Flowers even got the best of Hughes, one of the league’s fiercest pass rushers.\n\"We both want to win,\" Flowers said of Coughlin. \"That’s just what it is. I want to play.\"\nFELLS TO INJURED RESERVE: The Giants announced veteran TE Daniel Fells was placed on injured reserve after a staph infection was discovered in his ankle. Former Giants TE Adrien Robinson, released before the season, is among a group of players working out for the team today.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T11:11:17.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
