Cozens on October 1,   \nAfter Monday’s 6-1 win over Greeley, the John Jay girls tennis team is undefeated as it heads into final half of the regular season. \nThe Indians (7-0) also scored wins over Fox Lane, Rye and Yorktown last week, and Monday’s match was another big test. \n“We were pumped up. We knew Greeley is always a perennial favorite in the league. They had beaten us last year, so we knew it was going to be a tough day, and we wanted to play our best, and fortunately we did,” said Coach Mike Racanelli. “We’re firing on all cylinders.” \nJohn Jay improved to 4-0 in Conference I League D with a surprisingly one-sided 7-0 win over Fox Lane on Friday. The Indians had beaten the Foxes earlier in the season, 5-2, in a hard-fought match that was much closer than the final score would indicate. \nBut Friday’s result “even surprised us,” said Racanelli. \nJohn Jay won six of the seven matches in straight sets, with senior Tatiana Blechman rallying from a set down to win at second singles on a pro-set tiebreaker, 6-7 (4-7), 6-1, 11-9. \nAnya Ivenitsky won at first singles, 6-2, 6-2, and Bailey Burke didn’t lose a game at third singles, 6-0, 6-0. \nThe winning doubles teams were Izzy Bienen and Sonia Lange (6-4, 6-1), Nadia Shtohryn and Lily Gengler (6-4, 6-1), Oriana Tannenbaum and Callie Saks (6-3, 6-1), and Leah Cohen and Acadia Thielking (6-4, 6-3). \nIn Monday’s win over Greeley, Ivenitsky beat Carly Levitz at first singles, 6-2, 6-3, and Blechman won at third singles over Zoe Arditi, 6-3, 6-1. At second singles, Chloe Zikha of Greeley beat Burke, 6-3, 6-2. \nBienen and Lange won at first doubles over Jamie Isacoff and Jordan Feinerman, 6-2, 6-0, and at second doubles, Shtohryn and Jillian Delin swept Danielle Abrams and Jillian Poles, 6-3, 6-3. \nThe final two doubles matches were decided in pro sets. Tannenbaum and Callie Saks defeated the team of Chloe Krugel and Dani Zilkha, 8-4, and Cohen and Thielking topped Kyra Fichtenbaum and Kara Lipson, 8-2. \nOn Sept. 21, the Indians handed Yorktown its only loss of the season, 5-2, in a very close match in which John Jay pulled out three doubles matches on third-set tiebreakers. \nJohn Jay had a pair of straight-set wins. Blechman won at third singles, 6-2, 6-0, over Yorktown’s Anisha Duvvi; and Cohen and Thielking beat Emily Huang and Mournica Kamesan at fourth doubles, 6-0, 6-2. \nBienen and Lange won in three sets over Amba and Gowri Viswanathan, 6-3, 2-6, 10-5. At second and third doubles, John Jay’s teams were beaten badly in the first set but rallied to pull out the matches. At second doubles, Shtohryn and Gengler came back to beat Caroline Foster and Jessie Gerdis, 1-6, 7-5, 10-5; and at third doubles, Tannenbaum and Saks lost the first set 6-0 before rebounding to win their match, 0-6, 6-2, 10-6, over Alexis Stancov and Annamarie Khandji. \nAt first singles, Greeley’s Caitlyn Ferrante was able to outlast Ivenitsky in a hard-fought match, 3-6, 6-2, 10-8; and at second singles, Greeley’s Alessia Sigillo defeated Burke, 6-3, 6-3.
