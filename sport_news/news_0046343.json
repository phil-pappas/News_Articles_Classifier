I renewed my contract and I'm very happy. This is a great club and I hope everything goes well. \n\"It was a special summer, as I said, but I believe things happen for a reason. I'm in a club where I feel very accepted, respected, loved and am very happy.\" \nUnited are currently third in the Premier League table after eight games.
