It’s the “48-hour rule.” That kind of mentality comes in handy after a loss like last week’s, when Northern Illinois owned Ball State on the ground. \nThe Huskies rushed 59 times — a season high for Cardinals’ opponents — for 273 yards. \n“I mean, we’re angry about it,” said junior linebacker Sean Wiggins. “But we’re just really focused on stopping them this week.” \nThis week’s team to stop will be Sun Belt opponent Georgia State (1-4, 1-1). And it might be a welcome change of pace for the Cardinals, considering this unit just doesn’t run the ball well. At all. Period. Through five games, the Panthers have rushed for 486 yards. \nOn the other hand, quarterback Nick Arbuckle is completing 64.7 percent of his passes, and he’s already gained 1,549 yards. That’s in just five games, by the way. For comparison, Ball State has passed for 1,460 yards through six contests. \nWhile Georgia State isn’t a very complete team, that’s not changing Ball State’s approach. \n“Everybody is playing D-I football for a reason,” Wiggins said. “Everybody’s got a great running back and everybody has a good offensive line.” \nBall State learned that lesson three times over the last three weeks. \nIt first lost a road game to No. 20 Northwestern it could — and maybe should — have won. Then it managed just 26 rushing yards on 30 carries in a home loss to No. 22 Toledo. Then, Ball State found itself on the losing end of a 59-41 barn burner against Northern Illinois. \nThree weeks, three different lessons learned. Three games that were quickly forgotten by players living by the 48-hour rule. \nThe stretch will serve as motivation for Ball State this weekend, as it takes on the unproven Panthers. There’s no room for error as the Cardinals move into the second half of the schedule with just two wins. \n“They’re all important,” said head coach Pete Lembo. “We’ve had a tough stretch here. This is a really important game, but it’s no more or less important than any other.” \nThe three straight losses include two in the Mid-American Conference. It’s not time to start looking at bowl eligibility just yet, but Ball State will have a hard time winning six games if it can’t knock off Georgia State at home this weekend. \nThis is Ball State’s last nonconference game, and it only gets tougher from here. Central Michigan, Massachusetts, Western Michigan, Ohio and Bowling Green are the remaining five after Georgia State. \nOf course, Ball State already has three ranked teams in the rearview mirror, including No. 9 Texas A&M. But the players aren’t thinking about those games. That’d be breaking the rule. \nContact Ball State sports reporter Dakota Crawford at dmcrawford@muncie.gannett.com or follow @DakotaCrawford_ . 2 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tspne.ws/1Lygt7p TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:02:06.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
