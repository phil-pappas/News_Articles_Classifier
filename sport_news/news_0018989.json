Washington on Tuesday, and couldn't muster much offense early.\nThe Truckers' Jamil Edwards gained 55 yards on his first carry.\nOther than that, Churchland totaled minus-18 yards in the first half. Lake Taylor led 28-0 at the intermission.\nLake Taylor's defense also provided scoring. Roman Bond scooped up a fumble late in the first quarter and ran it in 7 yards for a touchdown.\n\"We are going to hang our hats on defense,\" Sawyer said. \"If they can't score, they can't beat you.\"\nLake Taylor wore pink numbers and its coaches wore pink shirts to recognize breast cancer awareness month. Sawyer said his sister, Kim Jones, died of the disease on Mother's Day. She was 53.\nSenior cornerback/wide receiver Wayne Davis said the team promised before the game to make a statement in honor of Jones.\n\"That's what we did,\" Davis said.\nMike Connors, 757-222-5217,\nmichael.connors@pilotonline.com\nTwitter: @MikeConnors14\n Eastern District High Schools Norfolk Sports", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://hamptonroads.com/2014/04/rankings-top-10-boys-soccer", "http://hamptonroads.com/2014/04/rankings-top-10-girls-soccer", "http://hamptonroads.com/2015/03/rankings-top-10-high-school-baseball", "http://hamptonroads.com/blogs/jami-frankenberry", "http://media.hamptonroads.com/cache/files/images/775031000.jpg", "http://hamptonroads.com/2014/04/rankings-top-10-high-school-softball", "http://hamptonroads.com/blogs/larry-rubama", "https://twitter.com/757teamz", "http://hamptonroads.com/2015/10/lake-taylor-thumps-churchland-qb-injures-shoulder", "http://hamptonroads.com/pilot/sports/high-schools", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?app_id=191370510928567&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F757teamz&send=false&layout=button_count&width=120&show_faces=true&action=like&colorscheme=light&font&height=28", "http://hamptonroads.com/2015/07/2015-public-schools-football-schedules"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:15:57.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
