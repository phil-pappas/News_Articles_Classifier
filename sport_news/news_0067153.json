The best officials are the ones who seem invisible on the field.\nSo I had a difficult time watching Sunday's game between the Cowboys and Eagles. And I wasn't alone in my misery. It was shared by the hundreds of thousands sitting in NFL stadiums last weekend and by the millions upon millions watching the games at home on television.\nThere were too many penalties. Way too many penalties, way too many flags.\nThe Tony Corrente crew assessed 26 penalties for 202 yards Sunday night in Philadelphia, including a franchise-record 18 against the Cowboys. That represented the most penalties assessed against an NFL team since the third week of the 2013 season when the New York Jets were penalized 20 times for 168 yards in a game against Buffalo.\nAnd Cowboys-Eagles wasn't even the high-penalty game of the weekend. The Pete Morelli crew assessed 26 penalties for 215 yards in the Baltimore-Oakland game -- 13 more yards than Cowboys-Eagles. And four other penalties were declined in that game.\nOakland was assessed 16 penalties for 106 yards. Over in the Eastern time zone, Buffalo was assessed 14 penalties for 140 yards in its game against New England. In the Central time zone, Chicago was assessed 14 penalties for 170 yards against the Cardinals.\nLast weekend was completely out of whack by NFL officiating standards.\nIn 2014, the highest-penalty weekend came in the 13th weekend when 225 penalties were assessed league-wide. The most yardage assessed was the 1,969 in the third weekend.\nI've been charting NFL penalties since 2001. The worst weekend ever for yellow flags was the 12th weekend of the 2005 season when 254 penalties were assessed totaling 2,070 yards.\nBut last weekend beat that by a bunch -- 298 penalties for 2,659 yards. That was 44 more penalties for almost 600 more yards than the worst weekend in the last 14 years. That was 73 more penalties for almost 700 more yards than the worst weekend of 2014.\nThere were seven games with 20 or more penalties last weekend. In 2013, there were only nine games during the entire NFL season with 20 or more penalties. There were six games last weekend with more than 200 yards in penalties. There were only five such games all of last year.\nSo I called an officiating friend for an explanation. He said September was the \"learning month\" in the NFL. Officiating crew are given points of emphasis each season -- penalties that deserve greater scrutiny, such as defensive holding. But the starters play so little in the preseason, the message doesn't come across as clearly in August as it does in September. Thus, the flags.\nThe numbers back him up. Six times in the last 10 seasons the high-penalty weekend came in the month of September. The players figure out what they can and can't get away with in the opening month and then the season smooths out, the penalties decline.\nBut the Cowboys have more to do than just smoothing out. Overzealous officiating wasn't their only issue Sunday against the Eagles. The Cowboys were assessed six false start penalties and a delay of game. That's seven penalties right there before the ball was even snapped.\n\"If you ask me what the No. 1 issue in the game was, it was penalties,\" Cowboys coach Jason Garrett said. \"We had 13 penalties on offense. It's hard to be an effective offense that plays with a good rhythm when you have that many penalties and you're behind the sticks as much as we were. We have to address it.\n\"Some of them were procedural penalties. Too many of them. You can say all you want about officiating but that stuff's on us. Every official in the league will call those penalties. We have to get that addressed. There's no excuse to say we were in another team's stadium with the crowd noise. You can't live in that world. You have to get it addressed and get it right. Some of the other penalties, we have to look at them and see how they're going to call them in this league. We have to make sure we get it cleaned up.\"\nAnd the officiating crews need to do some cleaning up of their own. They have to remember the paying customers are in the stands to see Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, Adrian Peterson and J.J. Watt dominate games -- not the Tony Correntes, Pete Morellis and Ed Hochulis. Last weekend was the theater of the absurd. That wasn't just a learning moment for the players. It was detention for the fans.\nFewer yellow flags will make for a far more enjoyable NFL-watching experience for all of us.\nListen to Rick Gosselin at 10:50 a.m. Tuesdays on Sportsradio 1310 AM/96.7 FM The Ticket with Norm Hitzges.\nMORE MUST-CLICK COWBOYS CONTENT OPINION, ANALYSIS\nGosselin: Falcons have their own version of Tony Romo, complete with playoff failures\nGosselin: What the Cowboys need to do with Romo out\nMoore: .500 football while Tony Romo is out would exceed expectations\nMoore: Cowboys appear to be really limited in the red zone\nGosselin: A realistic return date for Romo and Bryant\nLaufenberg: Don't panic ... why Cowboys can go 5-3 in next 8 games\nLaufenberg: What the Cowboys MUST do to beat the Atlanta Falcons\nMoore: What makes Sean Lee a linebacking genius\nGosselin: Cowboys-Eagles marred by theater of the absurd, out-of-whack officials\nStephen A.
