(AP) - A man who brought millions of dollars in counterfeit poker chips to an Atlantic City poker tournament and then flushed them down the toilet is going to prison.\nA judge on Thursday sentenced 43-year-old Christian Lusardi of Fayetteville, North Carolina, to five years in prison. Lusardi also must pay $463,540 in restitution to the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa for the revenue it lost when it canceled the 2014 tournament and $9,455 to Harrah's Casino Hotel for damaging its plumbing.\nLusardi pleaded guilty to trademark counterfeiting and criminal mischief.\nAuthorities say Lusardi flushed the fake chips down the toilet in his room when he suspected the scheme was uncovered. The chips clogged the pipes and guests had water dripping into their rooms.\nLusardi had won $6,814 in the tournament.\n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
