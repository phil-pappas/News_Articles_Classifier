(AP Photo/Sakchai Lalit) \nBANGKOK (AP) — Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal swapped tennis outfits for traditional Thai silk jackets Friday and shook hands with the head of Thailand’s ruling junta on a trip that mixed sports with politics. \nThe No. 1-ranked Djokovic and his longtime rival Nadal were in Thailand for a sold-out Friday night exhibition match dubbed “Back to Thailand.” The event was organized by local authorities to boost confidence in the country’s safety after the Aug. 17 bombing that left 20 people dead and more than 120 injured. \nOne of the day’s photo opportunities was a visit to the Erawan Shrine, the site of the blast, where the players laid wreaths and posed for pictures on a brief visit, under tight security and a pelting rain. \nThe trip to Thailand came with easy money for the two players — who split a payment of 150 million baht ($4.1 million), according to the Lawn Tennis Association of Thailand, an organizer of the event. But it clearly came with a few strings attached. \nOne requirement, apparently, was dress code. The players were outfitted in traditional silk jackets in colors of respect for the country’s monarchy. Djokovic wore yellow — the color that represents the king of Thailand — and Nadal wore blue, in respect for the queen. \nIn their formal attire, the players visited the ornate Grand Palace and then met with the junta leader, Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led a May 2014 coup that overthrew an elected government and then installed himself as prime minister. \n“I’m glad that two of the world’s best tennis players are here in Thailand,” Prayuth told the U.S. Open champion and the No. 7-ranked Nadal during a meeting at his office, known as Government House. \n“This will get more people to come to Thailand,” Prayuth added, as he shook hands with each player and they exchanged gifts. Djokovic, winner of 10 Grand Slams, and 14-time Grand Slam champion Nadal each presented the junta leader with a tennis racket, and Prayuth gave them each a golden replica of a traditional Thai mask. \nThailand’s vital tourism industry has grappled with how to overcome the bad publicity of the 2014 coup followed by the August bombing, in the heart of Bangkok, which police say was linked to China’s Muslim Uighur minority. \nLater in the day, the players warmed up for the evening match, a best of three-setter, which both said was meant to give a good show to the crowd in the 5,700-seat Hua Mark indoor stadium. \nAt a Thursday news conference, Djokovic said he hoped to bring “a smile” to fans faces and Nadal said the purpose of the exhibition was “to create good fun for the people.” \nDjokovic and Nadal have faced each other 43 times in tour-level matches, with Nadal winning 23 but Djokovic winning their last two matches at the French Open and Monte Carlo. \nDjokovic last came to Thailand in 2008 when he lost the final of the Thailand Open to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, while Nadal visited the capital in 2010 for the same tournament and lost in the semifinals.
