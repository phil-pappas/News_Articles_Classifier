State College is always a tough place to play so that makes the margin of victory impressive. This week they'll take on a pass-heavy team in Carlisle. Expect the Rams to put a lot of pressure on Carlisle's quarterback this week. Woodland Hills (6-0) - The Wolverines defeated Canon-McMillan 49-7 last week. This week, they take on West Allegheny, our #3 team in Class AAA. This will be the toughest test so far this year for the Wolverines. Running back Miles Sanders did not play last week due to a bruised heel. St. Joseph's Prep (3-2) - The Hawks defeated St. Joseph's Regional (NJ) 28-5. Running back D'Andre Swift ran 21 times for 221 yards and three touchdowns. He also caught three catches for 43 yards. We were asked why we kept St. Joseph's ahead of LaSalle since the Explorers defeated Malvern Prep and St. Joseph's Prep did not. It's simple: we currently believe that St. Joseph's Prep is the better team between the two teams right now. Wait a minute? They play each other this week? They'll settle the debate on the field. Pine-Richland (6-0) - The Rams took out Seneca Valley last week 35-28 and in the process, won their 19th straight game over a WPIAL opponent. Sophomore quarterback Phil Jurkovec threw for 258 yards and two touchdowns to go along with 233 yards rushing another touchdown on the ground. Will they be looking past Butler this week with Central Catholic game coming the following week? Probably not. Downingtown East (6-0) - The Cougars are one of the more under-the-radar teams in our rankings. Downingtown East defeated West Chester Henderson 42-7 last week. This week, they'll take on a Coatesville squad looking to bounce back from last week's loss to Downingtown West. This should be a very entertaining match-up. Wilson (5-1) - The Bulldogs set a Lancaster-Lebanon League record for consecutive victories at 53 by defeating Hempfield 15-9. The Bulldogs are still missing running back Shane Dantzler who has been out for the majority of the season. It was a good gut-check type of win for the Bulldogs who actually trailed 9-7 in the fourth quarter before pulling out the win. The Bulldogs take on Conestoga Valley. Downingtown West (6-0) - The Whippets defeated Bishop Shanahan 27-16 and moved up two spots in our rankings. They'll take on West Chester East this weekend at home. If Downingtown East defeated Coatesville, the Ches-Mont American Division championship could be on the line when they meet up in week ten. Bethlehem Freedom (6-0) - Freedom defeated Dieruff 39-0 last week and enter our PA Preps top ten for the first time this year. They will take on Whitehall this weekend at home. North Allegheny (5-1) - The Tigers enter our rankings for the first time this year with a 42-7 win over Butler. This week's opponent is Fox Chapel. North Allegheny has won four straight since their week two loss to Pine-Richland. Penn-Trafford (6-0) - Penn-Trafford defeated Greater Latrobe 63-8 last week. There are several teams nipping at the heels of the Warriors for the number ten spot. They'll take on Shaler this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T07:13:38.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
