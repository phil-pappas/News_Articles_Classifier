Remember the crowds ooohing and ahhhing as he rocked back and fired pure filthy? That loose left arm exploding forth from that smooth, repeatable delivery? The neighborhood kids, grimy noses pressed hard against the chain link, stretching to get a glimpse of their own Syd Finch? The scouts swarming Paul Walsh Field like locus in the rapture? The townfolk whispered of it from the coffee shop in the morning to the speakeasy at night: This kid from Acushnet was destined for pro ball. Nah. You don’t remember all that. It never happened. On Aug. 8, Kathy Fuller walked into NewBridge Bank Park in Greensboro, North Carolina. She held out her ticket to get scanned and took a seat, peering out onto the field as the Greensboro Grasshoppers played host to the Kannapolis Intimidators. It was her third straight game, and she hadn’t even seen her son warm up. Finally, in the middle innings, Nick jogged onto the field from the bullpen. Eight outs, four of them by strikeout, and no base runners later, she’d seen her son secure his first professional win. “That was cool,” Nick says. “I’m telling her, ‘Chances are you might not even see me pitch.’ Then they put me in and I pitch three shutout innings.” **** The road through minor league baseball is notoriously difficult. Health and opportunity, bloodlines and politics, adjustments and attitude. The distance between making it and not is as thin as a newspaper page. But getting to the minors? That’s even tougher. So tough it seems impossible Nick Fuller ever made it. By the time Fuller was 21 years old, he’d never pitched in a high school or collegiate varsity game. He was a 6-foot-2 lefty, and he’d thrown some tough innings for New Bedford Post 1 in legion ball, but had deserted the game after his freshman year at UMass Dartmouth after never getting into a game. His father died in 2011, there were eligibility issues and he turned his focus to academics. Baseball became a thing of the past. Then Bob Prince reached out. **** Fuller was a plus-defensive center fielder for New Bedford High. He wasn’t much of a hitter —“horrible,” he describes himself — but he did always have a cannon in center. “He had a gun,” New Bedford High coach John Seed recalls. “I can just envision him playing center field and other teams would not run. He had a hose.” Normally, a tall, lanky lefty with a howitzer of a left arm would be on the mound, no questions asked. But Fuller had some arm issues his freshman year of high school and expressed to Seed that he wasn’t really interested in pitching. “He wasn’t really positive about pitching, so I never made him do it because he was a great outfielder,” Seed says. “I always thought he would be a good pitcher.” Fuller did pitch for Post 1 as a No. 3 starter in the summer of 2010 — he threw a perfect game against Easton — and Nate Lewis still remembers catching him. \"It seemed effortless to him,\" he said. \"He was real fun to catch for.\" **** In August, 2011, Bob Prince was named the new head baseball coach at UMass Dartmouth, taking over from Bob Curran, who had recruited Fuller as an outfielder/pitcher. Prince, in need of pitching, reached out to Fuller to come in and throw a bullpen session, and he reluctantly agreed. There was nothing reluctant about his first pitch. It snapped into the catcher’s mitt at 88 mph, a good 10 mph faster than he’d been throwing before he took two years off. Prince called Seed up, telling him “Coach, thanks a lot. Nick Fuller is hitting 90. He’s throwing gas.” Short of a Henry Rowengartner-type situation, how does that happen? “I don’t know,” Fuller says with a quiet laugh. “I really have no idea.” “He was a kid who had some arm issues in high school, growth plate issues in his elbow,” says Prince. “I think once that settled down — sometimes kids get physically bigger and stronger and I think that was the case with Nick.” Fuller re-joined the Corsairs and became a starter. But success didn’t arrive as quickly as 90 mph fastballs. As a sophomore — four years after he’d graduated high school — he went 4-6, striking out 54 batters with a 6.42 ERA in 67⅓ innings. Prince still saw promise. “His arm is very loose, that’s not something you can teach kids,” he says. “It’s a God-given gift. It was a matter of giving him confidence and repeating his motion.” The next year, Fuller’s ERA dropped to 2.82 and he went 3-3 in 47 ⅔ innings with 40 strikeouts. “With any young guy you have to give him the opportunity to work through situations live, and that’s what he did,” Prince says. “To his credit, he kept getting better. He took what happened on the mound and we’d work on it in the bullpen.” A turning point came during a game in Plymouth, on the back end of a conference doubleheader. During warm ups, Fuller didn’t feel he had his “A” game, so he huddled with his head coach. “We had a long discussion about going out and letting it fly,” Prince says. “It’s not about thinking through things. He went out and was a beast in that game. He commanded the zone, and it was one of those moments, for me, where he was like ‘OK, I have the stuff.’” That junior season earned Fuller a spot in the esteemed Cape Cod League with the Wareham Gatemen. He pitched in four games (two starts), going 1-1 with a 5.83 ERA and eight strikeouts in 12 ⅓ innings. When an influx of players from the NCAA World Series cost Fuller his roster spot, he accepted an offer to play for the Martha’s Vineyard Sharks in the Futures League. The Sharks’ were managed by John Toffey, whose father, Jack, was an agent who had represented Dartmouth High grad and former Red Sox pitcher Brian Rose. Jack Toffey helped spread Fuller’s name around, and not long after, a Miami Marlins scout showed up. He just so happened to be there the day Fuller tossed six innings of one-run ball. It was just one of several strong performances, as he went 4-0 in seven games (five starts) with a 2.52 ERA and 47 strikeouts in 35 ⅔ innings. In his final three starts he gave up just one earned run and nine baserunners over 21 innings. Weeks later, after Fuller started and won a playoff game for the Sharks, Jack Toffey called with the news. Fuller had been offered a professional contract. “You never know what will happen,” Seed says. “I tell my kids that all the time. You never know who’s watching when you play. All you need is to have a good day in front of the right person.” **** Fuller flew down to the Marlins’ spring training complex in Jupiter, Florida, in August 2014 to sign his first pro deal. He was injured at the time, so he didn’t compete the rest of the 2014 season, but “it was cool to see the complex and be around everyone.” The injury, which had initially seemed minor, was later diagnosed as a stress fracture in his humerus bone. By January he was healthy enough to return to Jupiter for rehab before spring training began. “You see all the big leaguers around the locker room, it’s a good experience,” he says. “Jose Fernandez was still rehabbing so he was around a lot.” Fuller spent the spring working on his curveball, which had been the weakest of his three pitches. He made adjustments to prevent himself from releasing too early, and he dedicated hours of practice to keeping the ball low. “That was key,” he said. “I’m not big on flexibility, so it was just repetition and getting out in front of it. It got to be one of my better pitches.” After extended spring training, Fuller was sent to upstate New York to play short-season A-ball with the Batavia Muckdogs of the New York Penn League. Fuller was only there for eight games, pitching four shutout innings, striking out seven and allowing just one walk and five hits. One night, at about 1 a.m., as the team bus hurtled away from Williamsport, Pennsylvania, after a game against the Crosscutters, Fuller’s phone rang. He was being called up to Low-A ball in Greensboro. Four hours later a taxi arrived at the team hotel as Fuller stood on the curb, his bag hastily packed with all four outfits he owned. “The call-up surprised me,” he says. “(Greensboro) was a little different. Everything is a little more upscale. I knew most of the guys.” Life as a Grasshopper started swimmingly. Fuller didn’t allow a run in his first three outings. After his fourth appearance, a bit of a clunker in which he surrendered his first homer as a pro, he was called up to High-A ball in Jupiter, but his stay lasted just three games and he didn’t throw a pitch before being sent back down. That’s when Fuller started to struggle. He was leaving his fastball up in the zone and suffered through an 8.78 ERA in nine July outings. So he went to talk to his pitching coach, Jeremy Powell. “I said, ‘What do you see? Can you pick anything up?’” Fuller recalls. “He picked out a few things. I wasn’t aligned right when I was releasing the ball. I was crossing over and my fastball was staying flat.” Fuller started doing towel drills — grabbing a towel and throwing it like it’s a baseball, but without releasing — every day to work on repeating his motion. In his final 9⅓ innings of the season, he had a minuscule ERA of 1.93. He won his first game. His confidence grew. “That was good,” he said. “I was worried about them giving me the chance and the innings to prove myself.” Just then, as his tenacity was matching his talents, he tore a lat muscle on Aug. 17. By the time he was ready to return, the minor league season was over. “It was definitely a roller coaster,” Fuller says of his first season in the minors. “I went from spring training to Batavia to Greensboro to Jupiter to Greensboro. It was a lot of airplanes and a lot of ups and downs.” **** Fuller’s been spending this fall back in Acushnet, coaching baseball in Plymouth and trying to find work as a substitute teacher. In January, he’ll get the call telling him what day to report back for spring training. Would it be crazy to think this easy-going, self-effacing young with the quick smile, the quietest one at the end of John Seed’s bench, has a chance making the majors? “No, I don’t think so,” Prince says. “You look at the premium there is on left-handed pitching and Nick has three pitches he can get outs with at the pro level. I would not be shocked at all if he makes it.” On the one hand, he’s a 24-year-old who hasn’t pitched above Low-A ball. On the other, he’s got an arm with less than 250 innings on it. He’s only been pitching for five years. “It’s nice to see something good happen to a nice kid,” Seed says. “A lot of times kids like him get lost in the shuffle. But he’s taken advantage of the shot he got. I’m so happy for him.” For those who knew him after he embraced pitching, Fuller’s successes aren’t so surprising. “I always knew he had it,” Prince says. “I think that’s one of the things, when I look back on his career with us. That’s where the growth was. It’s not like he added speed to his fastball or depth to his breaking ball. It was the confidence and mentality of taking the ball in a big game. I think at this point, Nick controls his future.” And what a future it can be.
