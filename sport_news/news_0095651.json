That didn’t surprise anybody, because by starting Tanaka Wednesday against the Red Sox the Yankees were setting him up to pitch the wild-card game with five days’ rest instead of four.\nLater in the gloomy day, the Yankees found out Tanaka will start against the Astros on Tuesday night at the Stadium.\nGirardi had never formally announced Tanaka, but he was the pick.\n“He is pitching,’’ Girardi said of Tanaka, who wasn’t sharp against the Red Sox because he hadn’t pitched since Sept. 18 because of a strained right hamstring. “That was the guy we planned on pitching in that one game playoff, but we had to see how he was and we wanted to get him as healthy as possible.’’\nThe final test came and was passed Saturday.\n“He is on a normal schedule, he did his normal bullpen [Saturday] and is ready to go,’’ Girardi said of Tanaka, who went 12-7 with a 3.51 ERA in 24 regular-season starts.\nAfter saying Saturday that CC Sabathia could be an extra-innings reliever Tuesday night, Girardi said “it’s possible’’ when asked if the veteran lefty is still being thought of as a reliever for Tuesday night.\nGirardi understands MLB’s attempt to start all of Sunday’s game at the same time so no teams still in playoff contention have an advantage, but believes the system needs tweaking.\n“Here is the thing that bothers me with it a little bit. We don’t have to deal with it, but if it’s a sunny day you are playing in shadows if you are an East Coast team. If it’s the most important game of the year to get in, I don’t think that’s right,’’ Girardi said. “I understand what they are trying to create but play all night games.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:46:02.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
