The sophomore failed to follow the pulling guard to the right and was stopped for no gain on second-goal at the 1-yard line. Meanwhile, three linemen to his right cleared a path and pushed defenders to the back of the end zone. Auburn did not score and trailed 14-0.\nOne week later, Barber made the right decisions. He scored a career-high five touchdowns (the most by an Auburn running back since Carnell Williams did it in 2003) and two big runs, including a 36-yard touchdown, cemented a much-needed 35-21 win against San Jose State inside Jordan-Hare Stadium.\n\"That's who he is,\" Auburn coach Gus Malzahn said. \"He gets stronger as the game gets going on.\"\nWhen Barber needed to go right, he went right. When he needed to go left, he went left. The running back many teammates have called the hardest working player on the team is accustomed to overcoming obstacles and learning from mistakes\nA third-team tailback a year ago, Barber has emerged as Auburn's go-to starter. He's rushed for 100 yards in four of five games, upping his total to 558 yards with an additional 147 yards on 28 carries against the Spartans.\nBarber makes the tough yards look easy, especially in the fourth quarter. He gets better with each passing minute, too, and is averaging an eye-popping 7.5 yards per carry in the fourth quarter. \"To be honest, after most of these games, I don't really feel that sore,\" Barber said.\nBut it's not easy.\nThe Alpharetta, Georgia native battles dyslexia and ADHD every single day . The reading disorder affects how the brain interprets words and symbols, and it wasn't until 2014 he realized one day he was reading backwards. When he arrived on campus in 2013, he needed extra time to learn the playbook.\nHis father, Ken, has helped his son along the way. Ken Barber battles dyslexia, too.\nThe learning disabilities can be overwhelming, even if Barber has managed to excel in classroom with a high grade-point average. Sitting on the bench for two seasons can also wear a kid down. Barber thought about transferring several times during his first two seasons at Auburn. Similar thoughts popped in his head as recently as the week before the season opener against Louisville, when it appeared Roc Thomas would open the season above him on the depth chart. It was \"touch and go\" in late August, Ken Barber said, but he didn't specifically mention leaving the football program.\n\"We've talked about it a few times -- more than a handful, I'll put it to you that way,\" Ken Barber said. \"Things happen for a reason.\nEvery time Peyton Barber is overwhelmed, his family, high school coaches and Auburn running backs coach Tim Horton comfort him and tell him to keep moving forward. \"I've always told him: you've been through this before,\" Ken Barber said. \"In the long run, it all works out. You have to stay the course and you have to continue to trust and believe and work hard.\"\nPeyton Barber is hard on himself, too. One mistake in practice before the season opener bothered him so much he sent Malzahn a text message . \"I was kind of nervous he wouldn't have faith in me,\" Peyton Barber said.\nHe thinks hard about his answers in press conferences and often corrects himself in the middle of a sentence. Mistakes in games trouble him especially. \"He's probably harder on himself than anyone else and that makes it even better,\" Ken Barber said.\nPeyton Barber's unexpected rise up the depth chart has been the key to keeping Auburn's roller coaster season on the rails.\nIt's difficult to live in a world of hypotheticals, but Barber has undoubtedly saved the Tigers several times. Called into action after Thomas and Jovon Robinson were injured in the season opener, he melted the clock with several first-down runs in the 31-24 victory against Louisville. His big catch on third-and-9 and the ensuing touchdown run in overtime pulled Auburn out of upset territory against Jacksonville State.\nOn Saturday, he stepped up again in critical situations. San Jose State pulled within a score, but Barber responded quickly with a 36-yard touchdown run to put Auburn ahead 35-21 with 4:36 remaining. Minutes later, a 28-yard run allowed Auburn to kneel the ball and secure the victory.\n\"It was a great performance, unbelievable,\" quarterback Sean White said. \"Five touchdowns is something special. I'm really happy I'm his teammate.\"\nThe two runs in back-to-back possessions are the longest of Peyton Barber's Auburn career. The 36-yard run pulled Auburn out of the danger zone and sent his father into a frenzy in the grandstands.\n\"When I feel myself getting tired, I just tell myself to keep moving forward,\" Peyton Barber said. \"This is something you've been waiting for -- now is your time.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T10:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:21:58.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
