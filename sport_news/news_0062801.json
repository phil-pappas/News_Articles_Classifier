(Photo by Toni L. Sandys/ The Washington Post) \nA few minutes after his Washington Wizards completed practice Saturday afternoon, Coach Randy Wittman was asked whether any of the players who didn’t play in Friday’s preseason loss to the New York Knicks had practiced. There were seven of them, so he needed a little assistance remembering them all. \n“Did you bring the list?” Wittman said. “Go through the names for me.” \n[ Defense takes step back in 115-104 loss to Knicks ] \nIt’s very early in the preseason – just two exhibitions through with five remaining – and the real games don’t start until Oct. 28, but the Washington is banged up. \nAlan Anderson (ankle), Martell Webster (hip), Garrett Temple (hamstring) and DeJuan Blair (knee) didn’t practice Saturday after sitting out Friday. Nene was a full participant after a minor back issue sidelined him in the second half, as was Drew Gooden III, who had a sore right glute muscle. Jared Dudley, nearing a return from back surgery, practiced “some,” according to Wittman. \nWhile Dudley is slated to be a full practice participant Tuesday , the Wizards don’t know when Anderson, another offseason acquisition, will be cleared. The former Brooklyn Net hasn’t practiced since training camp opened after having bone spurs removed from his left ankle during the summer. With less than three weeks remaining until the Wizards’ regular season tips off in Orlando, the outlook is cloudy for Anderson. \n“Getting there,” Wittman said when asked when the team will start worrying about Anderson’s availability for the start of the season. “What are we, 18 days, 19 days away? We got to get him well first. That’s first and foremost. Yeah, it’s getting to that point.” \nAnderson recently had his ankle re-evaluated in New York and has curbed his activity after going through individual workouts for the first couple days of Wizards training camp.
