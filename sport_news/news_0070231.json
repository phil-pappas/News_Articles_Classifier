He only made news in South Korea this year during a failed bid to extend his waiver for mandatory military service. He wasn't sure what kind of reception he would receive at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea. And as Bae stood over a 12-foot putt that was critical to the International team's rally, half his teammates were on the edge of the green and thousands of Koreans were watching in the gallery. \"I'm pretty sure he was nervous. I was nervous watching him,\" Danny Lee said. \"So he had to stand up and man up, and hit that golf ball.\" The celebration when the putt dropped was raw emotion, a defining moment for Bae and the International team in its bid to finally give the Americans a fight. Bae teamed with Lee for a 1-up fourballs victory over Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker, and the Internationals won their first team session in four years to pull within a point of the Americans. Next up is a double session today of eight matches that will shape the final round. \"That putt Sang-moon made on No. 18 today was probably the highlight of the last two days for us,\" International captain Nick Price said. Price had other reasons to cheer. Louis Oosthuizen and Branden Grace made three big putts around the turn and sailed to a 4-and-3 win over Jordan Spieth and Dustin Johnson, while Charl Schwartzel and Thongchai had little trouble against an American team of Chris Kirk and Bill Haas that went 13 holes of nothing better than par. The Americans, up 4-1 after the opening session, had their lead cut to 5½-4½. \"I think the U.S. team after yesterday, they probably thought it was going to be a walk-off,\" Grace said. \"We put our chests out and we went full heart. We're in a good position now. We're just one point back, and you know, a lot can happen.\" The U.S. lead might have been slightly larger if Phil Mickelson had known the rules. A penalty that baffled even the captains — the match went from all square to 2 up in one hole — began when Mickelson was not aware of the one-ball rule. Players must stick with the same model of golf ball for the entire match in fourballs and singles. That didn't cross Mickelson's mind until after he switched to a firmer golf ball on the par-5 seventh to help him reach the green in two. Only when he saw U.S. captain Jay Haas did he ask him to make sure it was OK. It wasn't. \"It's my responsibility to know that,\" Mickelson said. \"I should have at least asked about it before I teed off.\" The penalty in this format is known as a one-hole adjustment — one hole is awarded to the other team. The rules committee made it worse by mistakenly telling Mickelson that he was out of the hole, and so Mickelson picked up his ball. Only later did the committee realize that Mickelson should have been allowed to finish the hole because the penalty already had been assessed. LPGA: At Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, South Korea's Ha Na Jang used a late three-hole birdie run to take a one-stroke lead Friday in the LPGA Malaysia. The 23-year-old Jang shot a bogey-free 6-under 65 to reach 10-under 132 at Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club. She made a downhill 10-footer on the par-4 14th, holed a right-to-left curler from 15 feet on the par-3 15th and ran in a 12-footer on the par-5 16th. CHAMPIONS: At Cary, N.C., Bernhard Langer shot a 7-under 65 in windy conditions to take a two-stroke lead in the Champions Tour's SAS Championship. The 58-year-old German star had seven birdies in a bogey-free round at Prestonwood Country Club. He won the Senior Players Championship in June for his 24th victory on the 50-and-over tour. Gene Sauers, John Riegger and Scott Dunlap shot 67, and Kenny Perry was another stroke back along with Tom Lehman, Duffy Waldorf, Kevin Sutherland, Rod Spittle, Greg Kraft and Olin Browne.
