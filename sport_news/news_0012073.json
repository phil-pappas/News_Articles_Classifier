Von Miller is an exceptional, exceptional player and really all across the board. That's the thing with them. Sometimes, from week to week, you'll look at a group and there's a group on the field that you feel like you can attack whether it's the front, the linebackers, the secondary. They don't have that. \n\"You look to the next group and you go, 'Golly, they're good too,' and you move to the next group and so, I think what makes them unique is that they're good outside too. Typically, you have great pass rushers and then, they make up for maybe lack of stability outside or whatever, but these guys are good outside and they're good with pass rush, so we'll have our hands full. We understand that, and we're putting together a good game plan, but it will take a good week's work to be prepared for these guys.\" \nKnown as an offensive team for several seasons, this year's Broncos have turned up the pressure on defense under coordinator Wade Phillips, and it has had positive results. \nThe Broncos have allowed only 278.0 yards and 15.8 points per game, registered a league-best 22 sacks and are tied for first with eight forced fumbles over the first five weeks of the season. Denver ranks second in interception return yards and first by allowing third-down conversions only 29.7 percent of the time. \n\"We have not gone against a defense like this, one that rushes the passer like they do, get off the ball, very good in the secondary,\" Browns coach Mike Pettine said. \"I think they are No. 1 in a bunch of categories or at least top five. I think No. 1 overall defensively. It is for a good reason. Wade Phillips has them playing at a very high level. \n\"I think it starts with their edges, and it's not just Von Miller. We're not sure of DeMarcus Ware's status, but just what those two have been able to do, when you add a (Shaquil) Barrett and a Shane Ray -- I mean they were rolling four pass rushers on the edges -- that's tough because that speeds up a quarterback's clock. We were watching a cut-up the other day, I asked Flip, 'Is this the sack cut up?' He goes, 'No, this is just a normal 11 personnel cut-up that we're watching.' \n\"Not only do they sack the quarterback, they're hitting him, too, and that has an effect over time. We're aware of that. We talked last week about running the football and lack of it and that we would have to change our thinking. Anytime you can rush the passer the way they do, you have to be able to establish some type of run. That will be important to us. Part of it, too, is to get ahead of the sticks to not be in those situations. Anytime you can tell a Von Miller that it's second-and-10 or its third-and-11, they are playing the run on the way to the quarterback. We have to be in as few situations like that as possible.\" \nDenver is the first team in the NFL in the last 17 years with at least 14 takeaways and 22 sacks through the first five games of a season. Over the last 15 years, those 22 sacks are tied for the second-most over the first five games of the regular season. \n\"Obviously, that's a huge thing in this league,\" Broncos quarterback Gary Kubiak said of rushing the passer. \"If you can't get there, it's very tough. We've been consistent doing that, and you better be able to stop the run or you're not going to get people in tough third-down situations. We've been playing well. We've been playing deep -- a lot of guys playing, coaches have done a great job, so we just have to stay committed and keep going.\" \nAlthough the Broncos' defense has proven their ability to generate turnovers and get to opposing quarterbacks, the Browns know the one thing they cannot do is panic, which is why they welcome the opportunity to test themselves against the best. \n\"I t's a delicate balance because we have a ton of respect for them, but again, we have to trust our ability to go out and execute as well,\" McCown said. \"You just can't fold up the tent and go, 'We've got the No. 1 D this week. Who do we got next after that?' \n\"We're going to go out and play them and feel like we've had a good day so far as far as our preparation. The coaches have put a good plan for us, and that's the part that I mean. When you grab the good out of these games that we've had and you build that momentum, that's what you want to take that into so that you don't buckle up and go, 'Oh, well, we're playing the No. 1 D.' We are and it's going to be a huge, huge hill to climb. But at the same time, we feel like we've done enough good things that we'll be in good shape to try to climb that hill.\" 1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1ROe6y3 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:44:00.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
