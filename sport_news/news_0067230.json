Gary Parrish of CBS Sports later reported the same news .\nThis issue has been the topic of conversation in Big Blue Nation over the past few weeks. While Kentucky head coach John Calipari became frustrated with the constant questions, he never seemed to worried about Labissiere's eligibility status .\nThe 6-foot-11 Labissiere is originally from Haiti, but came to the United States following the devastating earthquake of 2010. His guardian, Gerald Hamilton, led Labissiere to multiple high schools over the years, the last stop being a prep school he started called Reach Your Dreams Prep, which is the same name as Hamilton's foundation.\nLabissiere joins a frontline that includes Alex Poythress, Marcus Lee and fellow freshman Isaac Humphries.\nKentucky opens its season on Nov. 13 against Albany.\nAdChoices Go to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://www.foxsports.com/college-basketball/story/2015/10/14/kentucky-wildcats-john-calipari-skal-labissiere-eligibility.html", "https://twitter.com/GaryParrishCBS/status/657701195671318533", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/ShamsCharania/status/657675881247318016"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:36:55.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
