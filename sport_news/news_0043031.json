The strength of the offense has to be its vaunted corps of running backs, touted as one of the best collections of talent in the nation. \nThe blueprint is there. Shilique Calhoun planning B1G homecoming on Saturday \nLast Saturday against Michigan State, Purdue ran the ball 32 times for 165 yards, a hefty 5.2-yard average. Markell Jones ripped off a 68-yard run as part of a 157-yard, two-touchdown effort. \nIndiana ran the ball 55 times for 176 yards and three touchdowns against Ohio State last Saturday, with the top-ranked Buckeyes coming to Piscataway on Oct. 24. \nWhile neither Purdue nor Indiana were able to pull off upsets, they had chances to win in close games. And a moral victory against the Spartans and Buckeyes, in front of enthusiastic crowds in primetime, wouldn’t be the worst thing that could happen. \nWhat can’t happen is what transpired at Penn State last month, when Rutgers produced just 43 rushing yards on 32 carries, or 1.2 yards-per-attempt in a 28-3 loss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T23:18:29.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
