They’re a year older and a year better than last year. They return a lot guys, kind of like we did in 2013-14, but then you add in the three move-ins and they are very, very talented, especially in the skill positions.”Pulaski Robinson (7-0, 3-0 4A-4 Conference) has generated 3,078 yards of total offense in seven games with an average of 513 yards per game.Senators quarterback Bennan Johnson, who Price described as “the one that makes their offense go,” is 58-of-87 for 1,174 yards and 15 touchdowns. Brennan has thrown three interceptions.The Sand Lizards (7-0, 3-0) have scored 313 points this year — an average of 44.7 per game, and given up an average of 11 point per game defensively.Price said Pulaski Robinson’s spread offense will try and create match-up problems for Dardanelle, while their defense will try and create turnovers. The Senators have created 22 turnovers so far this season.“We have to stay ahead of the chains,” Price said. “We can’t get into third-and-10 and third-and-12 situations and expect to have success in this game.”Still — playing at Keenan Field is one advantage, Price said. Another: Price believes his offensive and defensive line outclasses the Senators.“We are bigger and we are more physical,” he said. “I like our inside linebacker match-up, too. Our running backs will have success like they always do, depending on the blocking. I think if we can do a good job executing up front, we can have some success.”The emphasis in practice this week is simple — limit touchdowns: bend, but don’t break.“They are going to get yards,” Price said. “We don’t care how many yards they get. We care about how many points. We just have to keep them out of the end zone.”It’s a big game, but it isn’t the only game, Price said.“It’s huge,” he said. “At the same time, it’s just another game. If we win, we still have to get up and get ready for Dover. If we lose, we still have to get up and get ready for Dover.”Price hesitated to call it a conference championship.“We have to beat Dover, and they have to beat Pottsville,” he said. “Nothing is said and done.”Kickoff is scheduled for 7 p.m.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:16:43.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
