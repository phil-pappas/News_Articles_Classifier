(Photo by Todd Bennett/GettyImages) (COLUMBIA, S.C.) -- This weekend's football game between the University of South Carolina and Louisiana State University will be moved from Columbia, S.C. to Baton Rouge, La., after storms and flooding led officials to believe the event would unduly stress USC's infrastructure.\"Yesterday, we made the extremely difficult decision to cancel classes for the week due to the stress 34,000 students would place on the region's recovering infrastructure,\" USC President Harris Pastides said in a statement . \"There is no doubt 85,000 fans would exact the same toll.\"Kickoff time for the game has yet to be announced. LSU and USC are in opposite divisions of the Southeastern Conference, meaning they play each other only twice every twelve years -- one at each team's field. LSU was originally scheduled to host USC in 2020, though there has been no word on whether the teams could potentially move that game to Columbia.\"We want to support South Carolina in anything they want to do,\" LSU head coach Les Miles said Wednesday.LSU had its season opener cancelled due to lightning storms.\"We want to do the right thing and do what is best for all concerned,\" USC head coach Steve Spurrier said in a statement. \"It appears the best thing is to travel to LSU.\" \nCopyright   Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 2:19PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:33:44.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
