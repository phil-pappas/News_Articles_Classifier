Or maybe the team has someone tentatively penciled in and didn’t want to make an announcement without 100 percent confirmation. There likely is a long list of celebs who would volunteer for the job considering the team’s famous fanbase, not to mention it’s the Cubs’ first playoff game at the Friendly Confines since 2008.\nSaghy said the team expects several celebs at Monday’s game, including Eddie Vedder, John and Joan Cusack, WWE Champ-turned-MMA fighter CM Punk, Smashing Pumpkins rocker Billy Corgan, Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville, Jim Belushi, ESPN college basketball personality Digger Phelps and former Cubs Kerry Wood, Ryne Sandberg and Ryan Dempster.\nlgomez@tribpub.com\nTwitter @TribLuis\nFacebook @TribLuis\nInstagram @TribLuis\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bed8a/turbine/ct-cubs-cardinals-first-pitch-7th-inning-stretch-20151012", "https://twitter.com/TribLuis", "https://instagram.com/tribluis/", "https://www.facebook.com/TribLuis/"], "published": "2015-10-12T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:38:10.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
