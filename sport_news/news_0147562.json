Scheifele rifled the shot home to give the Jets a 3-1 lead. \nIt was another example of the confidence Chiarot is showing this pre-season after scoring two goals and six points and playing solid defence in his rookie campaign. \n“I feel pretty comfortable, obviously the most comfortable I've felt in a training camp,” said Chiarot, who was paired with Dustin Byfuglien in practice again Friday. “It feels good to not be nervous or second-guessing what I'm doing on the ice.” \nJets coach Paul Maurice couldn't say enough good things about Chiarot on Friday as the team prepared for its final exhibition game Saturday night in Calgary. \n“It's a really great example of what one year will do,” Maurice said. “Coming back into the locker room now as an NHL pro. His summer was well spent. He's more powerful, he's stronger and the offensive part of the game, he's jumping in and making some plays now. It's just all confidence. \nChiarot showed flashes of offensive ability last season, even though the most points he's ever had in a season in junior or pro hockey is 24. \n“I'm not sure that we expected this much growth this quickly,” Maurice said. “It's pre-season, I understand that but throughout training camp, Ben has been very strong and as the pre-season has gone along, more physical as the intensity picks up. He did good work and he's reaping the benefits right now of his summer because he's a very fit man.” \nChiarot is expected to be one of the Jets top-six defencemen this season and will get plenty of ice-time if he remains paired with Byfuglien. Perhaps it's playing with his mobile, offensive-minded partner that has Chiarot thinking more about jumping up in the play. \n“I feel a lot more comfortable with the puck on my stick and confident carrying it and using my skating to make room for myself,” Chiarot said. “It's been working so far, I feel good, and I'll look to keep doing it.” \nRAFFL THE FIGHTER \nThomas Raffl very nearly had his first NHL fight on Thursday night. He even dropped his gloves to go with Flames rugged forward Brandon Bollig. \nThat's when Jets heavyweight Anthony Peluso stepped in and took over, tossing punches with Bollig. \nRaffl wanted to show what he could do, but didn't get the chance. \n“I wanted to fight but honestly I didn't know that that guy was making a living out of (fighting) so I'm thankful that Peluso jumped in for me there,” Raffl, who is with the Jets on a professional tryout offer, said. \nFor his part, Peluso said he would have jumped in for any teammate in that situation. \n“I saw there was a little bit of a scuffle going on and I know Raffl doesn't exactly know who the people in the league are yet so I felt that I had to step in,” Peluso said. “That's pretty much it. \n“For me it's important to show my teammates that I'm still willing to do that. You always want to prove that you are more than a one-dimensional guy but it's definitely something for my teammates to feel, that I'll always be there for them and I'll always have the backs of anybody that's here.” \nMaurice said he liked what Peluso did. \n“It was good ... you put your best shootout guys first, right? Maurice said. “If Raffl was a guy that had been in the AHL or the NHL for five years and knew all the personnel, it might be different. \nThat's what Bollig does. Anthony's good at it as well, as we've seen. I liked that.” \nRaffl, who is on the bubble to make the team, hopes to get a chance to show what he can do another time. \n“I'm sure I'm gonna get my chance and I'm going to get to show that I can fight too,” the 29-year-old Austrian said. “There's not a lot of fighting going on back home but I can defend myself and I can step up.” \nCOPP THE QB \nMaurice was absolutely raving Friday about a video on YouTube showing Jets centre Andrew Copp's skills as a high school quarterback in Michigan. \nCopp displayed a big arm in the video, prompting more than a few people to joke that perhaps the Blue Bombers could use him more than the Jets. \n“I watched the video yesterday ... It's unbelievable,” Maurice said. \n“If we ever have a flag football game, we're drafting him first overall, it's not even close. He can throw that thing a mile. There's video of him and some statistics. He threw for 494 yards one game, fourth most in Michigan state high school history. It's really something, you've got to see him.” \nIf you don't believe Maurice, just Google it. Copp was definitely a two-sport star in high school. \n“It's awesome, to the point where you compare it to the centre ice position,” Maurice said. “If you can pick the switches up, and the defences, to play quarterback, I think it helps with the centre ice position. I think that's probably why he picks up the switch-offs and the reads and the speeds as quickly as he does. It's also probably why he's not afraid to go into the corners. He's probably been in some tougher areas.” \nICE CHIPS: Andrew Ladd and Adam Lowry both missed practice on Friday, but Maurice said both were minor injuries. He said both could miss Saturday's game but he also said it was possible both could play.
