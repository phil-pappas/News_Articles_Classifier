Benefit payment such as child allowances, education stipends and disability support would not be paid for the duration of the minor’s time in prison after sentencing.\nJudges are not obligated at present to impose custodial sentences on minors who have been convicted of these offenses. In addition to the minimum sentences, the amendments would make it possible to fine minors or their parents, charge them with court expenses and payment of compensation for victims of their actions.\n“Battling terror requires multiple means and creative solutions. These laws will allow us to keep terrorists where they belong — behind bars, as well as hurting them in their pockets, their most sensitive spot. Parents will know that their children’s actions have consequences,” Shaked said.\n“Israel’s government and its head are overreacting and pouring oil on the fire by proposing harsher sentencing of minors — Palestinian ones, obviously. This comes after relaxing the rules of engagement which created a Wild West atmosphere with executions of Arabs on the streets,” MK Ahmad Tibi (Joint List) said in response to the committee’s decisions.\nThis is the second attempt in three months to impose harsher sentences on stone throwers. In July the Knesset passed a law allowing for prison sentences of up to 10 years for anyone convicted of throwing rocks at a vehicle, without the need to prove intent to damage the vehicle or hurt its occupants.\nJonathan Lis\nHaaretz Correspondent\n ", "external_links": ["http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-12T13:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:49:59.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
