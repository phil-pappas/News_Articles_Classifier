Neither was the Sharks' ability to kill one penalty after another. \nBut the Sharks stayed unbeaten with their fourth in a row Friday, as Joe Pavelski and Brent Burns both scored in a shootout to give San Jose a 2-1 over the New Jersey Devils at the Prudential Center. Jones made a save on Jacob Josefson, and Mike Cammalleri's attempt went wide to end the game. \nJones' franchise-record shutout streak ended with 3:38 left in the third period when Adam Henrique tipped a shot from the blue line by Damon Severson into the net for a power-play goal. Jones' streak ended at 234 minutes and 33 seconds. \nBefore that, the Sharks had killed off 16 straight penalties to start the season. They took another five minors Friday before Henrique's goal. \nIn the third period, the Sharks were down two men for a combined 60 seconds as they took three penalties in a span of 3:01. Justin Braun was whistled for holding the stick, and Brenden Dillon and Marc-Edouard Vlasic both took delay of game calls. \nThe Devils managed seven shots with the man advantage for the game. \nPatrick Marleau got the Sharks on the board as he got open in front of the Devils' net, took a pass from Joel Ward and fired a quick wrist shot past New Jersey goalie Cory Schneider for a 1-0 San Jose lead 2:01 into the game. Advertisement \nMarleau was awarded a penalty shot with 6:18 left in the second period as officials ruled he was hooked from behind by the Devils' Andy Greene. But Marleau 's wrist shot attempt went right into the chest of Schneider. \nThe Devils had a handful of quality chances in the first 40 minutes, and Josefson appeared to get his team's first goal late in the second period. It was ruled, though, that Stephen Gionta interfered with Jones before Jacobson's shot crossed the goal line, and the goal was waved off. \nThe Sharks were the beneficiaries of another disallowed goal Tuesday against Washington, as after a San Jose coaches' challenge and video review, it was ruled that Washington's Jay Beagle interfered with Jones before Dmitry Orlov's shot crossed the goal line. \nIn the first period, Jones set a franchise record for minutes without allowing a goal. \nJones entered Friday's game with a shutout streak of 178 minutes, 11 seconds dating back to the early stages of the Sharks' Oct. 7 game against the Los Angeles Kings. The previous team record was 178 minutes and 55 seconds, held by teammate Alex Stalock, who set the mark in 2014. \nJones didn't face a shot in the first 44 seconds. But shortly after Marleau scored, Jones made key saves on Reid Boucher and Tuomo Ruutu to keep the Devils scoreless. \nJones was coming off back-to-back shutouts against Anaheim on Saturday and Washington on Tuesday. He entered Friday's game with 77 straight saves. For more on the Sharks, see the Working the Corners blog at blogs.mercurynews.com/sharks .
