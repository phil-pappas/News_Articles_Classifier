Beltre took swings in the batting cage Sunday night and received more treatment Monday. Bannister says running is probably \"most problematic\" for Beltre. \nTexas leads the best-of-five series 2-1. The Blue Jays have to win Monday to force a deciding Game 5 in Toronto. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
