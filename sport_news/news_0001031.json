His third one, against another Cy Young Award winner, was even sweeter. \nMurphy’s sixth-inning home run off Zack Greinke proved the difference as the New York Mets knocked off the Los Angeles Dodgers from the National League Division Series on Thursday with a 3-2 victory in Game 5. Andre Ethier yells at manager Don Mattingly in Dodgers dugout in Game 5 \nJacob deGrom and the Mets bullpen limited the Dodgers’ explosive offense to two first-inning runs, squelching several threats and riding Murphy’s heroics to their first NL Championship Series since 2006. Murphy drove in a run in the opening inning with a double and helped New York tie the game in the fourth with alert baserunning. \nMurphy’s double-play partner, shortstop Ruben Tejada, sustained a broken leg on a late slide by Chase Utley in Game 2, a play that turned that game in the Dodgers’ favor and appeared to shift the momentum their way. \nBut the Mets won a 13-7 slugfest at Citi Field in Game 3 and, despite losing to Kershaw the next night, accomplished something many thought highly improbable – beating Kershaw and Greinke twice in a five-game series. \nThe Dodgers, with a record payroll of more than $300 million, bowed out in the first round for the second year in a row, a disappointing finish that may prompt major offseason changes. \nSome of their frustration may have come to the fore in the third inning, when outfielder Andre Ethier was seen yelling at manager Don Mattingly in the dugout. \nMurphy, who had homered off Kershaw in Games 1 and 4, added to an increasingly glowing free-agent resume when he took Greinke deep to right field to break a 2-2 tie. Your browser does not support iframes. \nThe Mets had tied the game in the fourth thanks to Murphy’s heads-up baserunning and a Dodgers’ heads-down moment. Third baseman Justin Turner was stationed in the second baseman’s usual position as L.A. shifted its defense for lefty-swinging Lucas Duda. When Duda walked, Murphy trotted to second and, noticing third unattended and Greinke looking down with the ball in his hands, sped to the bag and reached it uncontested. \nMurphy then scored easily on Travis d’Arnaud’s sacrifice fly to right field. \nThe Dodgers scored twice in the first and seemed poised to chase deGrom time and again, as he failed to retire them in order in any inning except the sixth. This was not the same deGrom who blew away Los Angeles over seven shutout innings in Game 1, tying a club playoff record with 13 strikeouts. This was deGrom in survival mode, allowing runners to reach scoring position in each of the first five innings. \nDespite putting 10 runners on base in that stretch, the Dodgers could not deliver the key hit, as the hard-throwing right-hander found success with his off-speed pitches. L.A. had a man on second with no more than one out in innings two through five, and each time the runner was stranded. \nThe poor situational hitting might have led to the dugout yelling match between Ethier and Mattingly in the bottom of the third. Turner, who went 3-for-4, led off the inning with a double, but Ethier failed to advance him as he flied out to left. After Yasmani Grandal walked, Kike Hernandez grounded into a double play. \nThe Mets’ Terry Collins, managing in the postseason for the first time at 66, said this experience has taught him the sense of urgency in the playoffs. He backed up his words by bringing in closer Jeurys Familia to open the eighth, after rookie starter Noah Syndergaard threw a scoreless seventh. \nFamilia became the first Mets pitcher with a six-out save since Jesse Orosco in Game 7 of the 1986 World Series. \n“Every out means something,’’ Collins said before the game. “Every run is hard to get, so you can’t give runs away. Every day seems like it’s the last.’’ \nThe Dodgers sprayed line drives off deGrom all over the park in the first inning, rapping out four consecutive singles to go ahead 2-1 on RBI hits by Turner and Ethier. \nLike Greinke in the top half, deGrom then dialed up his heater a couple of notches to escape further trouble, striking out Yasmani Grandal and Hernandez with fastballs at 98 and 97 mph, respectively. \nThe right-handers combined for nine strikeouts in the first two innings alone, following in the pattern of a series in which the clubs came in with a total of 89 whiffs, tied for the most ever after four games in postseason history. \nThe Mets benefited from a replay review to score their first run in the opening inning, as leadoff man Curtis Granderson was initially ruled out on a slow roller between first and second. The call was correctly overturned and Granderson came around to score on Murphy’s double to left-center. \nGALLERY: METS vs. DODGERS Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
