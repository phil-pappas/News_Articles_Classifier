Tuesday, the league released the results.\nOne thing is pretty clear as far as the Chicago outlook; the rest of the league expects the Bulls to win a lot, but for no real reason. Despite having the highest percentage of second place votes Eastern Conference rankings, the Bulls have few individual accolades.\nThe GMs were asked to rank just about every talent needed to be an NBA player. Everything from the player who forces the most adjustments to the most underrated player acquisition.\nBulls players were left off most of the rankings, but a few found themselves receiving votes. Jimmy Butler brought in the most attention, Butler was ranked as the third best perimeter defender and tied for the third toughest. He also received votes for being among the best shooting guards and player who best moves without the ball.\nFred Hoiberg was ranked third among coaches in a new job who will make the biggest impact. Rookie Bobby Portis was deemed the second biggest steal of the draft and Pau Gasol was the ranked as the second best international player.\nOutside of Hoiberg, Portis, Gasol and Butler, no other Bulls received enough votes to be included in anything higher than the “also receiving votes” category of a question.\nDerrick Rose was noticeably left off the results all together. The former MVP didn’t receive any votes as one of the best point guards, leaders or any other question asked.\nOf course, the survey has to be taken with a grain of salt. At least some of the GMs included Tom Thibodeau as one of the head coaches with the best defensive schemes. Of course, Thibodeau is not currently a head coach.", "external_links": ["http://www.nba.com/news/features/john_schuhmann/nba-com-2015-16-gm-survey/index.html?ls=iref:nbahpt3a", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/wp-ag/wp-content/uploads/sites/71/2015/10/bulls-gm-ranking.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-20T18:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:04:27.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
