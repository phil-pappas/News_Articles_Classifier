His results, however, at the Eastern Surfing Association competition last week off Jeannette's Pier in Nags Head, N.C., were much better. “They were very good,” said Nichols, a junior at Winnacunnet High School. Competing against the top junior men’s surfers from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast of Florida and all the Atlantic hot surfing spots in between, Nichols, 16, placed third in the long board competition after securing a semifinal berth and the equivalent of fifth place in the short board. “That’s my second year in a row getting third,” Nichols said. The difference was that this year Nichols was competing in the 15-17 age group for the first time (he didn’t turn 16 until August). “The ante gets bigger,” Nichols said. “It gets harder. The guys are more competitive and there are more people in that division and the judges are looking for better stuff.” The two types of boards require different surfing approaches, Nichols said. The short board – the marquee event and what is routinely shown on television – is “more progression, speed, power and creativity with maneuvers and turns,” Nichols said. “Long board is style and kind of finesse.” Progression, Nichols said, is being able to handle newer tricks and techniques, which include things like “air reverses” and “360s.” According to Lenny Nichols, his son faced fields of 48 competitors in the junior men’s short board and 24 in the long board division. Lenny Nichols is the Northern New England district director. He said the entire competition was plagued by bad weather, with a nor’easter parked a few miles offshore. But by Friday afternoon the situation had worsened considerably. Several youth division (11-14) events were scratched completely and there was serious discussion about cancelling the junior men’s long board. “Those kids had traveled from all over and they wanted to do it,” Lenny Nichols said. “It was unbelievable what they went out in.” “The wind was bad. The wind was onshore, which means it’s not good. It was about 30 to 40 miles per hour and it was raining the whole time,” Nichols said. “Trying to get out to the lineup is extremely hard, especially on a long board. It also makes seeing, and judging what a good wave is, much harder. The waves are everywhere and you couldn’t really see anything.” The weather also forced event organizers to speed up the heat process and eliminate normal rest periods. That meant Kai Nichols had the misfortune of competing in his heat, his semifinal and his final consecutively. He said trying to paddle his 9-foot board through the rough chop was grueling. “That’s so hard. In the final I got a cramp in my leg and was so tired,” Nichols said. “On the inside it was like 5 feet (of water) just dumping and it was super, super hard to get back out to the lineup and I was just super tired and gassed.” Nichols’ overall performance helped solidify his spot on the ESA All-Star team for a third consecutive year and confirmed that he is continuing to improve as a surfer. “My results show it and I also feel it when I’m free surfing,” Nichols said. “I just feel like new things come easier to me. Every session I’ll go out and work on a specific thing. You don’t want to just go out and do whatever. If you want to get better you have to go out and work on something new every time.” Being an all-star helps get surfers’ names out to the public and can generate some endorsement support. Nichols currently has sponsorship support to help defray costs of boards, wetsuits and entry fees. The all-stars also will train and travel together. Last year they did a training session in Hawaii. Nichols also plays soccer and baseball at Winnacunnet. He said he’s passionate about all of his activities but does allow the combination of playing high school sports and being from New Hampshire puts him at a competitive disadvantage in his surfing. Nichols was the only full-time resident from the Northern New England district to secure a top-four finish at Easterns. Greenland’s Lars Hamilton, a student at Portsmouth High, placed seventh in the long board. Cape Cod summer resident Robbie Gordon, who won the 11-14 short board, represented Northern New England. “I can’t go to every contest,” Nichols said. “Like there’s one coming up October 10th in New Jersey that I might or might not go to because I have a (soccer) game the day before. I try to go to the biggest contests or as many as I can. But I enjoy all of (the sports) when I’m doing them and I have fun while I’m doing them and I also like to compete.” The next step for Nichols, he said, is to qualify for a national contest on the West Coast. To do that he’ll have to fare well in three specific East Coast competitions put on by a single organization.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T20:14:49.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
