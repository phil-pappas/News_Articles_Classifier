Coach Cuonzo Martin, who added top-10 national recruits Jaylen Brown and Ivan Rabb to a core of three returning starters, said nothing is guaranteed. \n\"If you have talent, you're in the ballpark to do special things,\" he said. \"But there's a lot that goes into it. You look over the past 20 years, and there were a lot of talented teams. Some made it, some didn't. \n\"For us it's one day at a time, trying to be the best team we can be.\" \nThe Bears, who played four games during an August tour of Australia, figure to be ranked in the pre-season Top-25 for just the second time in 21 seasons. ESPN had the Bears at No. 12 in its No-Longer-Way-Too-Early Top-25 in August. Blue Ribbon Yearbook also ranks the Bears at No. 12 and Athlon Sports places them No. 13. \nCal's regular season opens Nov. 13 at home against Rice. \nMartin, who said everyone is healthy and ready to begin practice, came away from the 3-1 trek to Australia feeling encouraged. He said the Bears played as a team, adjusted to the physical style of older professionals and communicated well against opponents for which they had no scouting report. Advertisement \nBrown, a 6-7, 225-pound small forward, may be the most gifted player Cal has had in 20 years. He averaged 17.8 points on the Aussie tour. \n\"The expectation is day to day,\" Martin said. \"He's a very talented basketball player. \"He's physical, he competes, he tries to play at a very high level on both ends of the floor. I think he'll be ready for the challenge.\" \nRabb, at nearly 6-11, averaged 12.8 points and a team-best 9.8 rebounds in Australia. \"He did an exceptional job of rebounding the basketball, especially the way he gets off the ground to get offensive rebounds,\" Martin said. \nReturning starters are Tyrone Wallace, a first-team all-Pac-12 point guard, and shooting guards Jabari Bird and Jordan Mathews. Bird was the team's second-leading scorer in Australia, averaging 15.8 points. \nMartin said Wallace does not need to radically alter his game to accommodate Brown and Rabb. \n\"I want Tyrone to do what he's been doing, to continue to play, to continue to score,\" Martin said. \"I don't want him consumed with trying to be an assist guy. He understands what we need.\" \nBack in town after being on the road to recruit, Martin said he's ready to get to work with his team Friday. \n\"I'm always excited this time of year,\" he said. \"You can always feel the energy leading up to this.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:50:00.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
