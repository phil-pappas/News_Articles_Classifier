The win, coupled with losses by Cherokee and Milton, allowed the Wildcats to take sole control of fourth place of the region. Special photo by Cecil Copeland slideshow MARIETTA — Wheeler kept its playoff hopes alive with a 42-10 win at Pope on Friday night.The Wildcats (4-4, 3-3 Region 5 ) came into the contest tied for fourth in the region with Cherokee and Milton, but both lost Friday night, giving Wheeler sole possession of the final playoff spot with two games left in the regular season.“Our team responded well to the challenges this week,” Wheeler coach Mike Collins said. “We had a good week of practice. Hopefully, this win will keep our morale up and we’ll prepare for next week.”Wheeler will travel to third-place Etowah next week before hosting Lassiter in a game that could determine who the region’s final playoff team is.The Wildcats rushed for 394 yards, led by Corey Stovall Jr.’s 136 yards on 11 carries. Wheeler quarterback Gabe Magerkurth had 178 total yards with a rushing touchdown and passing touchdown.“Our offensive line is the strongest part of the team, and the unit took over (Friday),” Collins said.Wheeler’s defense was also productive, holding Pope (0-8, 0-6) to zero total yards in the first quarter and 302 total yards for the game. The Wildcats forced two turnovers, including one on Pope’s first offensive play of the contest, when Jordan Hobbs lost the ball on a rushing attempt and it was recovered by Wheeler’s Chinadu Ogbonna.Pope rushed for 28 yards in the game.“Our defense stopped the run really well and created turnovers, which were keys to the game,” Collins said. “We also tackled well and got pressure on the quarterback.”Trailing 35-0 late in the second quarter, Pope made a quarterback switch, replacing Evan Conley with Cambell Rickers. Pope outgained Wheeler 218-127 in total yards for the second half, and Rickers finished with a game-high 231 passing yards. “I thought we had a good game plan coming into the game, but Wheeler took it to us,” Pope coach Kyle Adkins said. “We continue to struggle with mistakes, and we’ll have to coach better. We’re going to have a good future, but it’s tough right now.”Wheeler jumped out to a 21-0 lead in the first quarter with touchdown runs by Stovall and Magerkurth, along with a Touchdown reception by Terry Smith. Riekan Donaldon’s 31-yard touchdown catch and Benaiah Franklin’s 1-yard touchdown run gave Wheeler the 35-0 lead in the second quarter. Pope’s lone score in the first half was a 22-yard field goal by Carson Mistretta late in the second quarter.Stovall scored his second touchdown of the game in the third quarter on a 3-yard run, while Pope’s Mickey Buechner caught a 15-yard touchdown catch in the fourth quarter to conclude the night’s scoring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:30:11.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
