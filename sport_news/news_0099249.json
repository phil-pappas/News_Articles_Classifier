He was 60. \nSaunders was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma in June and doctors called it “treatable and curable.” But he took a leave of absence from the team in September after complications arose during his treatment, which included chemotherapy. He had been hospitalized for more than a month. \n“Flip was a symbol of strength, compassion and dignity for our organization,” owner Glen Taylor said in a statement. “He was a shining example of what a true leader should be, defined by his integrity and kindness to all he encountered.” \nSam Mitchell has been named interim coach and GM Milt Newton is heading the team’s personnel department. \nSaunders went 654-592 in 17 NBA seasons with the Timberwolves, Detroit Pistons and Washington Wizards. But his best days came in Minnesota, where he nurtured Kevin Garnett from a teenager who went straight from high school to the NBA in 1995 and helped turn the woeful Wolves into a perennial playoff team. \nThe Timberwolves had started practice on Sunday when they got word of Saunders’ death. Practice was halted and a devastated Garnett left the floor, walked to the parking garage at the practice facility and sat down in the spot marked for Saunders. He posted a picture of the moment on his Facebook page with the message “Forever in my heart …” \nPhilip Daniel Saunders was born on Feb. 23, 1955, in Cleveland and was a prep basketball star at Cuyahoga Heights High School. His mother, Kay, nicknamed him Flip after hearing the name at a beauty salon. He played in college at Minnesota, teaming with Kevin McHale and Mychal Thompson as a senior to lead the Golden Gophers to a 24-3 record. Not long after graduating, Saunders got into coaching to begin a long and winding path to the NBA. He started at Golden Valley Lutheran College just outside of Minneapolis and was an assistant at Minnesota and Tulsa before seven seasons in the Continental Basketball Association. \nHe landed in the NBA in 1995, when he wrote a letter to Taylor asking for a job. McHale took over the basketball operations and Saunders became the GM. When Bill Blair was fired 20 games into the season, Saunders was suddenly the coach of a struggling franchise. \nSaunders and Garnett led the Wolves to eight straight playoff appearances, the last a trip to the Western Conference finals in 2004. He was fired the next season when the team disintegrated thanks in large part to contractual battles with Latrell Sprewell and Sam Cassell. The Wolves have not made the playoffs since. \nSaunders won 64 games in his first season in Detroit in 2005-06 and 176 in his three seasons coaching the Pistons. But he couldn’t quite get a veteran-laden team over the hump and into the NBA Finals, so he was dismissed in 2008. \nHe coached three more years in Washington before returning to Minnesota as president of basketball operations in 2013. \nSaunders deftly handled the exit of disgruntled forward Kevin Love, trading him to Cleveland for a package including budding young star Andrew Wiggins and Thaddeus Young, who was shipped to Brooklyn in February to secure Garnett’s return. \n“Flip you were one of a kind. Great basketball mind and even better human being,” Love said on Instagram. “You had a great impact on my life personally and professionally. RIP my friend. Prayers are with the Saunders family.” \nSaunders is survived by his wife, Debbie, son, Ryan, and daughters Mindy, Rachel and Kimberly. James practices \nLeBron James practiced for the first time since receiving an anti-inflammatory injection in his back, increasing the chances he’ll play in Tuesday’s season opener in Chicago. \nJames had been limited to shooting drills and conditioning since getting the shot Oct. 13. But he took part in every aspect of Cleveland’s workout on Sunday and said how his back responds will determine whether he plays against the Bulls. \n“The real test will be how I feel tomorrow when I get up,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T11:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:36:24.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
