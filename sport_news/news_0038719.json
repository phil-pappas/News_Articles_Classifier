Yreka lost a 34-25 heartbreaker to Lassen in the NALopener lastFriday at home after leading 25-21 early in the fourth quarter. Anderson is coming off a 54-0 dismantling of winless CentralValley in the Cubs NALopener. Yreka comes in at 4-2 overall and 1-1 in the NAL, while Anderson is 3-3 overall and 1-0 in league play. Today’s varsity contest begins at 7:30 p.m. at Miner Stadium. The junior varsity game begins at 5:30 p.m. Anderson has won two straight games and has outscored their opponents 83-0 in the last two contest. The last two wins came against Oroville and Central Valley, which are both 0-6 for the season. The third win was against 1-6 Red Bluff. Yreka’s four wins have come against 0-6 Mount Shasta, 5-1 Mazama. 2-4 Brooking-Harbor, and 2-4 Eagle Point. Anderson senior running back Grant Kingston has had an impressive year so far. He currently has run for 942 yards and 15 touchdowns. This includes 302 yards and seven touchdowns in a win against Red Bluff on Sept. 11. Yreka also has an excellent running back in senior Drew Kannely-Robles, who has rushed for more than 100 yards in five straight games. He currently has run for 956 yards and 12 touchdowns. He ran for 198 yards and two touchdowns, as well as throwing a TD against Lassen last week. Kannely-Robles has 16 total touchdowns for the season. In other NAL action tonight, West Valley (5-1,1-0 NAL) is at CentralValley (0-6, 0-1 NAL). Corning (3-3, 0-1 NAL) is at Lassen (2-4, 1-0 NAL.) Below, Yreka head varsity coach Orlyn Culp discusses the contest vs. the Cubs. Orlyn, how has your team done at practice this week? Players have worked hard. Last week’s loss was very difficult because we felt like we let that one slip away. They were, obviously, a very physical team and we couldn’t match that physicality for an entire 48 minute game. We’ve spent the week try to heal and prepare our backups for an opportunity to compete to help us beat Anderson. What can you tell me about Anderson this year on both sides of the ball? Anderson will run the “Veer Offense” again this season. Sometimes traditional, under center with two backs, sometimes in shotgun with a single back and motion. Defensively, they’ll employ a 4-4 attacking style defense. They are very aggressive and physical on both sides of the ball. Orlyn, what do the Miners have to do on offense to have success on Friday night? Page 2 of 2 - We’ll need to run the ball effectively and try to control the clock and field position. That’s our plan. Now, we have to go out and perform it. What does the squad need to do on defense to be successful? We’ll need to contain their backfield. Their running back (Grant Kingston) is one of the tops in the NorthernSection. (He’s the defending 100m NAL champion and he’s the defending NSCIF discus champion). They have two effective QBs who run their shotgun spread attack. Each has his abilities we’ll have to match. How vital is it for your team to earn an NAL victory this week? Truthfully, every NAL victory is vital to our team. That’s why we work and prepare each week, because we must play to earn the victory.
