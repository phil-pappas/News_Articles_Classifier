The state meet is Oct. 31 in Fort Dodge. By Troy Hyde Newton Daily News \nCOLUMBUS JUNCTION — Prairie City-Monroe junior Chris Ellens did not like the way he performed at last year’s state qualifier and was again upset at his performance at this year’s Heart of Iowa Conference meet. \nEllens had a chance at redemption Thursday during a Class 2A state qualifier hosted by Columbus Community, and the Mustangs’ top male runner clinched a spot in next weekend’s state meet with a 10th-place finish. \nThe top 15 individuals and top three teams at each state qualifier advance. \nAlso advancing from the Mustang girls team was freshman Payton Schut, who took the 15th and final qualifying spot in the girls’ 5K race. \nEllens’ time of 17 minutes, 25.49 seconds was originally good enough for 11th, but the junior moved up to 10th after Davis County’s Zach Hougland was disqualified. \nHougland won the race, but got his first-place medal taken away when he helped Mediapolis’ Garrett Hinson to his feet near the finish line. Both runners were disqualified and an emergency vehicle was called for Hinson. \nHinson did not finish the race, and the end result did not alter the overall outcome, but the Iowa High School Athletic Association backed host Columbus Community’s decision to disqualify Hougland. \nHougland will still get the chance to run at state however. Davis County advanced to the Iowa High School State Cross Country Championships anyway with a third-place finish. Fourth-ranked Mid-Prairie won the meet with 26 points, while No. 8 Williamsburg was the runner-up with 71. \nEllens will be making his first trip to the state meet next week in Fort Dodge. \nThere was no drama as he was 30 seconds in ahead of the final qualifying spot. \nThe same can be said for Schut, who continued her strong finish to the season with another strong effort Thursday. \nSchut crossed the line in the final qualifying spot, but she was 17 seconds ahead of the 16th-place finisher. Her time was 21:15.62. \nThe Mustangs were fifth overall as a team with 135 points. \nNo. 10 Mid-Prairie claimed the regional championship with 54 points, and sixth-ranked Williamsburg was the runner-up with 59. \nThe final state-qualifying team was Mediapolis, which ended up with 82 points. \nPCM also trailed Northeast Goose Lake, which was fourth with 116 points. \nJunior Jayci Vos, in her first year of cross country, was 25th overall with a time of 22:26.08. Two spots behind Vos was sophomore Baylee Smith. Her 27th-place finish was clocked at 22:34.66. \nThe final two counting positions were freshman Megan Townley in 33rd and freshman Sara Dudley in 49th. \nSenior Morgan Novak and freshman Morgan Uhlenhopp were non-counting finishers in 54th and 55th, respectively. \nThe Mustangs did not have the services of former state qualifier Rachel Stafford and senior Kiara Kappelman. Both runners missed the meet due to injury. \nWilliamsburg’s Julie Hollensbe, who is ranked fifth in 2A, won the race in 18:47.35. No. 8 Jordan Winke of Albia was the runner-up in 19:20.38. \nFinishing after Ellens in the boys’ 5K race was sophomore Blake Lee, who was 21st in 18:20.30. \nSophomore Noah Henkenius was 63rd, junior Brady North finished 66th and senior Andreas Vargas rounded out the counting finishers in 81st. \nMark Bruxvoort (84th) and Max VanGorp (87th) also competed for the PCM varsity. \nThe winner, after Hougland was disqualified, ended up being No. 16 Josh Keller of host Columbus Community with a time of 16:50.87. \nLuke Sigler and No. 18 Peyton Miller of Mid-Prairie were second and third, respectively. \nThe Class 2A state meet takes place at Fort Dodge’s Lakeside Municipal Golf Course. Schut and the 2A girls will run at 1 p.m., while Ellens and the 2A boys begin their race at 1:30 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:28:12.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
