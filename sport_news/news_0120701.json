Clemson is on a 12-game winning streak in the facility that was built in 1942. The school record for consecutive home wins is 13, set from the first home game of the 2011 season to the middle of the 2013 season when Florida St. ended the streak. \n*Clemson has won the last three games played at Clemson, all under Dabo Swinney Dabo Swinney Head Coach View Full Profile . Swinney is 3-1 against Georgia Tech in Memorial Stadium and the only loss took place in 2008 when he had been named interim coach the Monday before the game. Tech won that game, 21-17. \n*John Heisman coached at both Clemson and Georgia Tech. He coached the Tigers program from 1900-03 and led the Tigers to a 19-3-2 record and three conference championships. Clemson won the SIAA conference title in 1900, 1902 and 1903 under Heisman and played in its first “postseason” game ever in 1903. \n*One of the most unusual statistical occurrences in Clemson history took place during Clemson’s 33-12 victory over Georgia Tech in 1987 at Clemson. Clemson entered the game with a streak of 999 consecutive combined punt returns and kickoff returns without a touchdown dating to 1970. Then, on the 1000th return, Donnell Woolford raced 78 yards with a punt return for a touchdown. Then, later in the game Joe Henderson returned a kickoff return 95 yards for a touchdown. It is one of just two games in Clemson history that the Tigers have returned a punt return for a touchdown and a kickoff return for a touchdown . The other took place in 2009 when Clemson defeated Middle Tennessee State. \nWHEN GEORGIA TECH HAS THE BALL Justin Thomas is the perfect quarterback for Paul Johnson’s system. Thomas is 13-6 in his first 19 career starts at QB, including a 3-2 record versus ranked teams. He’s 2-2 versus Top 10 teams, beating SEC foes No. 9 Georgia and No. 7 Mississippi State in the Orange Bowl. Despite the run-based offense, Thomas has thrown a touchdown pass in nine straight games dating back to last season, the longest streak for a quarterback under Johnson. However, Tech has had trouble moving the ball over the last three weeks when it counts, and there isn’t just one reason. Inexperience at A-back, poor blocking and some head-scratching decisions by Thomas have led to the miscues. The Yellow Jackets have lost five fumbles and Thomas has tossed two interceptions, and the turnover margin hasn’t been what it was last season. \nTech is averaging 30 less yards per game from last season and doesn’t sit in the nation’s Top 40 in total offense.
