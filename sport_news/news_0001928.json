(AP) - Leonte Carroo says he is well aware of how lucky he is to be back on the football field. \nThe Rutgers receiver returned to practice Thursday after charges that he attacked a woman he used to date after a game Sept. 12 were dropped. \nCoach Kyle Flood reinstated Carroo on Wedensday, a day after a judge dismissed simple assault charges. \nCarroo declined to get into details of the incident. There are still simple assault charges pending against the woman and others, including Carroo’s girlfriend and mother. \nA Piscataway municipal court judge dismissed the charges against Carroo when the woman said she didn’t want to testify against him. That came hours after another judge lifted a temporary restraining order because the woman said she didn’t think it was necessary. \nRutgers host No. 4 Michigan State on Saturday night. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:23:28.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
