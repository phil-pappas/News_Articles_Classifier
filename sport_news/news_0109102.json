For instance, a coach might tell a hitter that 70 percent of his weight should be on his back foot and 30 percent on his front foot. “How does a player judge that?” Larish said. “He doesn’t have scales under his feet. While the information is correct, it’s presented in an ambiguous way.” Maddon said: “You have to imagine the middle ’80s. It was: ‘Where did he play? What has he done?’ All these ridiculous comments. And my point was always, it’s no different than a hitting coach or a pitching coach — he’s trying to teach you a skill.” Around the same time, Maddon came across another academic, Ken Ravizza, a sports psychology professor at California State, Fullerton. Ravizza, who has worked with various college baseball and football teams, as well as the Jets, later wrote the book “Heads-Up Baseball: Playing the Game One Pitch at a Time.” Ravizza has served as a consultant for the Rays and the Cubs. “Joe creates an environment where people can be themselves and play their game,” Ravizza said. “It’s very important to be able to relax and be focused on what you need to do and not make it bigger than it is, and Joe creates a culture that encourages that.” So after the Cubs lost to the Mets , 4-1, on Sunday night, music pulsed through the clubhouse, just as it always does. Maddon had the theme from “Rocky” blaring. “ ‘Rocky’ did set a great example in 1976 for all of us,” Maddon said. “So when you get behind the eight ball a little bit, sometimes you just go pound on some big slabs of beef in the cooler, and obviously you come back, and you’re fine.” When it was pointed out to Maddon that Rocky lost the title bout in that first movie, he shrugged. “It was just about the effort,” Maddon said. “He came back. He came back.” The Cubs hope they can do the same. Loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:59:45.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
