We are excited to play some good teams coming up and we are ready for the challenge\" said sophomore RB Grant Mohler. \nThe Mavericks have had quite the history with the Renegades in their short history, and they know this weekend will be another hard fought battle. \"They have so much power. They are good up front and a good power game and a passing game. They got a couple good linebackers and its going to be a tough one\" said James Monroe head coach John Mustain. \nAfter a rough start, Westside has now pushed its way back into the top 16 with wins over Independence and Scott, and it took some balance on offense to get this team rolling. \"We have been running the ball better on offense and we've been holding back the passing game waiting on this week. We are going to have to run the ball and throw it, and be a 50/50 team this week\" said Westside head coach Larry Cook. \nThe Renegades defense will now have to step up big on friday night, and try to control the Mavericks two headed attack. \"Can't cheat this game. Can't shut down their three or four favorite plays and you have to play them up and play them honest. That's the sign of a good team and a good offense when you have to play them straight up honest\" said Cook. \nThe name of the game will be who is the most physical, and who can do the little things right. \"Cut out mistakes things like that. Hopefully makes some plays on special teams. Hopefully this defense will continue to play the way its been playing\" said Mustain.\"We got to weather the storm and stay in the game. Stay in the trenches and fight, scratch, and claw and play with that pride that we've tried to build in here the last two years and hopefully my guys are up to the task\" said Cook.
