I was so used to that, and then coming to a big university where I wasn't known at all, it was a very big culture shock.\"\nIt took a little while, but Neal found her comfort zone with the Vols (6-1-5, 2-1-2 SEC), who play host to No. 12 Florida (8-3-1, 2-2-1) on Friday at 7 p.m. at Regal Soccer Stadium.\nLife in Knoxville couldn't be better for Neal, a junior forward.\n\"Now it's home,\" she said. \"I love it here.\"\nNeal, who also played midfield and defense in her first two seasons at UT, is tied for the team-high in goals with four and tied for second in scoring with nine points.\nHer goal of playing high-level Division I soccer has been realized.\nDuring her freshman year at Los Alamos High School, Neal began making the two-hour trip to Albuquerque twice a week to play with a travel team, Albuquerque FC United.\nShe continued playing travel soccer so she could gain exposure with college coaches.\n\"I was recruited by some good schools, but New Mexico doesn't really get seen (by college recruiters),\" Neal said. \"A lot of players haven't been recruited out of there, so I was lucky enough to be recruited by a big Division I SEC school. I was looking at other places, but this was by far my best and favorite choice.\"\nFourth-year UT coach Brian Pensky heard about Neal while he was coaching at Maryland.\nOne of Pensky's former players on Maryland's men's team, A.J. Herrera, was coaching Neal in Albuquerque.\nHerrera told Pensky he should take a look at Neal, and not long after he got the job at UT, she came to a UT camp at Regal Soccer Stadium in the spring of 2012.\n\"I saw exactly what A.J. was talking about: a kid who can play up top and run past people and put balls across the box and score goals,\" Pensky said.\nNeal, who committed to UT before her senior year of high school, got significant playing time as a freshman when she played in 18 games (two starts) and averaged 37.4 minutes. She scored two goals.\nOff the field was more of an adjustment for Neal.\n\"Freshman year was rough,\" she said. \"It was a hard year for me, and I got homesick, but I made it through and I'm glad I did.\"\nNeal was UT's second leading scorer in 2014 with 17 points (seven goals, three assists). In 22 games (16 starts), Neal averaged 56.4 minutes per game.\nNeal scored a goal in UT's 3-2 double-overtime victory over Ole Miss in the 2014 regular-season finale, which clinched a berth in the SEC tournament\n\"I found my place on the team last year,\" Neal said. \"I felt like I was finally contributing to the team, and we grew, especially in the SEC tournament (in reaching the semifinals). We were spectacular. I've never seen us play like that. This year, we're getting there. I think we're on a very good track to doing really well in the SEC and the SEC tournament.\"\nDave Link is a freelance contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:28:50.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
