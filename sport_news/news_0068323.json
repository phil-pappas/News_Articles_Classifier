For me it's about maintaining, start off well, finish well,\" he added. \"It's only pre-season.\"\nVince Carter held the previous pre-season record of 38 points.\nThe game was a homecoming, not just for Wiggins, who purchased 16 courtside seats for the game, but for Raptors Joseph and Anthony Bennett — both were playing their first games in Toronto for their hometown team.\n\"I was excited to play in front of my family, fans, friends,\" Joseph said. \"Thanksgiving, so happy Thanksgiving to all the Canadians out there. We had our Thanksgiving the other night, they came out here to support me. A lot of love floating around here.\"\nBennett, whose defence has been impressive thus far, had five rebounds to go with three points in 19 minutes.\nWiggins' older brother Nick, signed by Minnesota last month, also got into the game, scoring four points in the final five minutes.\n\"It was huge for the city and for the country, four Canadians on the floor,\" Joseph said. \"Even though it's pre-season. . . it's unbelievable, it just goes to show how much talent we have here in Canada and we're moving up the ranks.\"\nAndrew Wiggins scored the game's first five points, on a three-pointer then a dunk and had 10 points in a quarter that saw the T'Wolves lead 26-25.\nLowry had 22 points and Wiggins had 21 by the time the two teams headed to the locker-room at halftime, with the Raptors up 60-59.\nLowry poured in 19 in the third quarter as the Raptors started to pull away, taking a 96-90 lead into the fourth quarter.\nThe Raptors rested DeMar DeRozan while Kevin Garnett didn't play for the T'Wolves, for the same reason.\nThe Raptors game tipped off just as the Blue Jays were sealing their victory against the Texas Rangers to force a Game 5 of their American League Division Series.\nCasey said he would have forgiven a sparse crowd, but 19,277 fans showed up.\n\"If there's nobody here tonight, they've got a good excuse,\" Casey said prior to tipoff.\n\"I'm a baseball man, grew up playing baseball, coaching it. . . I think all our players, they're all in (the locker-room) watching it so, don't let them tell you they don't like baseball.\"\nThe Raptors and T'Wolves meet again in Ottawa on Wednesday as part of the NBA's Canada Series, which featured sold-out games in Winnipeg and Vancouver, and then Ottawa and Montreal. The Raptors play the Washington Wizards in Montreal to cap the series on Oct. 23.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:14:08.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
