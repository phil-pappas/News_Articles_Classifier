Burks had eight points, five assists and four rebounds in his reserve role.\nBurke, who’s played well all preseason after his tough sophomore season, might be an enticing option for Snyder because of his ability to put up points. He scored a team-high 17 points in a sixth-man role after putting up 20 against Russell Westbrook and the Thunder on Tuesday.\nBurke gave fans in the arena a thrill during the non-televised game, hitting buzzer-beaters at the end of the first three quarters.\n“The one thing that’s clear,” Snyder said, “is that Trey Burke is playing great.”\nNeto also played well, finishing with 10 points, two rebounds, one assist and one steal. He was on the court as the Jazz held the Nuggets scoreless for the first five and a half minutes to set the tone.\n“It doesn’t matter who’s on the court with me. I like to play,” Neto said. “I don’t care if it’s the starting lineup. I just like to play and enjoy it out there on the court.”\nGobert, who had by far his best preseason showing, was enthusiastic about this revised starting lineup. He thought Neto and Hood added a physical defensive presence in the backcourt and likes how Burke and Burks “give a spark offensively” off the bench.\n“I think we played with more intensity,” Gobert said. “Trey is a more offensive guard. And Raul is more of a defensive guard. Everybody’s got his strength. I think Trey can impact the games more from the bench, and I think that was a great idea to put Raul in the starting lineup.”\nThe Jazz, of course, were forced to go with Plan B at point guard this season because starter Dante Exum suffered a season-ending knee injury while playing for the Australian national team in July.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:21:06.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
