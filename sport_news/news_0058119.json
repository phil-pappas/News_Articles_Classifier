But don’t think he ever stops working. Minutes before he’d returned from a morning workout in the weight room. “I had a couple of days off,” he said, “but now I want to get in the weight room while letting my body rest.” On Friday night, Pilarte’s Bucaros de Bucaramanga team defeated the Pirates de Bogota 97-75 to sweep the Liga DirecTV finals. Pilarte scored 10 points with two rebounds and three assists in 25 minutes. “It was amazing,” said Pilarte, a 2006 New Bedford High graduate who played at Division II Bloomfield College. “The feeling is still surreal. Is this all a dream come true? All your hard work pays off.” After the game, after the confetti fell from the ceiling and the champagne was sprayed, the Bucaros team owner took everyone out to, of all places, TGI Friday’s for a celebration dinner and drinks. They had just wrapped up one of the most impressive seasons in the 23-year-old league's history. Bucaros went 19-1 during the regular season, winning their first 17 games, then went 9-1 in the playoffs, sweeping the Astros in the first round, beating Academia 3-1 in the semifinals and roaring past the Pirates, winning three times by double figures against the team Pilarte won a championship with in 2014. The 6-foot-4, 200-pound Pilarte started eight of the team’s 10 playoff games at shooting guard. In 29 regular and postseason games he averaged 9.4 points, 2.8 rebounds and 1.8 assists, matching those numbers during the finals — 9.5 points, 2.3 boards and 2.0 assists — while playing between 25 and 34 minutes in all four games. After a slow start to the playoffs — he scored just two points in the team’s first three games — he reached at least seven points in the final seven games, including 14 in Game 2 of the finals. “Everyone had to take a backseat and not expect the numbers we’re used to,” he said. “We had so much talent and there’s only one basketball. My role was to play team basketball, play my game, make open shots, slide and move without the ball.” From the first day of preseason practices, Pilarte could tell this Bucaros squad was going to be competitive, if not unbeatable. They’d brought in Arnold Louis, who Pilarte had played with before in his international hoops odyssey. Louis averaged nearly 20 points — eighth in the league — and 10 boards a game, leading the team in both categories. “I pretty much knew from the beginning, the chemistry was there from the rip,” Pilarte said. “We were playing great basketball from the beginning. We knew what type of talent we were dealing with in preseason.” Under the direction of coach Bernardo Fitz González, Bucaros entered the season with a defensive mentality that’s rare in the offensive-minded Liga DirecTV. Cribbing their playing style from the San Antonio Spurs. “He did a great job managing the team and bringing guys together and making guys believe in each other and playing good basketball,” Pilarte said. “He never wanted us to win, he just wanted our best each game. It was a great group of guys.” In the finals, the Pirates featured a pair of slogging big men who couldn’t get up and down the court well, so Bucaros opened up its game, running more and scoring at least 95 points in all four finals games, after reaching that mark just three times in their first 26 games. “Coach knew we could all score and that wouldn’t be a problem,” said Pilarte. “He was trying to change this league around because a lot of guys just look to score.” Pilarte will now wait to find out if Bucaros wants to re-sign him for another season. If not, his agent will search for a new home. After suiting up in the Dominican Republic, American Basketball League, Uruguay and three stops in Colombia, Pilarte will once again be looking for a spot on the map to push his thumbtack into. “He’ll have to find me a team that suits me and is the best fit for me,” Pilarte said. “I always had the dream of playing overseas, but if someone told me I’d be a two-time champion? Never crossed my mind.” He’ll spend another week in Colombia before returning to New Bedford to visit family and friends on Tuesday. There likely won’t be a ticker-tape parade down Purchase Street, but, nevertheless, one of New Bedford’s native sons will return home a champion.
