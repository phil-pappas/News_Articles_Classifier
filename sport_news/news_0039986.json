Vernon (4-4) in the other side of the bracket, while Pendleton Heights (3-5) visits Connersville (1-7). \nMt. Vernon, Pendleton Heights, Delta, Greenfield-Central and New Castle are all in the Hoosier Heritage Conference. \n“Most all those teams are in that same conference, so they all kind of play each other,” Holeva said. “We’ve seen Connersville Week 1 and they’ve struggled a little bit, Pendleton Heights we played in a scrimmage, Coach (John) Broughton has been there (40) years, … Delta does have one of the leading rushers in the nation at running back (Zach Mills, 1,555 yards), but other than that, we have not had a chance to see the rest of the teams. \n“… I’d like to think we have as good a chance as anyone.” \nNew Castle is 1-7 this fall with the only win coming 7-3 at Rushville. \nThe Trojans have just seven wins since 2008 and haven't had a winning season since at least 1994. \nDelta is ranked 14th in the latest Associated Press poll and has a perfect record against teams in Sectional 22 at 5-0. \nThe Red Devils beat the only team they played in the sectional, Connersville 49-20, in Week 1 of the season. \nMt. Vernon is 3-1 against Sectional 22 foes and Pendleton Heights is 2-2, while Jay County and Connersville are 0-1 and Greenfield-Central and New Castle are 0-3. \nRichmond last played New Castle in 2013 in what turned out to be a non-conference affair. \nThe Trojans announced prior to that season that they would be leaving the conference, therefore were ineligible for conference honors. \nRichmond easily won 49-3 and the Red Devils lead the all-time series 72-22-3. \nRichmond owns two football sectionals, both coming in 5A in 1991 and 1992. \nThe Red Devils have a tough task ahead of them, first, as they host NCC leader Kokomo Friday night at Lyboult Field. \n“It’s kind of neat to get an opportunity to play New Castle,” Holeva said. “I think we go to their place, then from there, when you get into sectionals, it’s the same old cliché, everybody’s 0-0 and you never know what’s going to happen.” \nIHSAA Class 4A Sectional 22 Game 1: Jay County (4-4) at Mt. Vernon (Fortville) (4-4) Game 2: Pendleton Heights (3-5) at Connersville (1-7) Game 3: Delta (6-2) at Greenfield-Central (3-5) Game 4: Richmond (5-3) at New Castle (1-7) Buy Photo \nRichmond's Jawuan Claiborne takes a handoff from Jordan Christian against Lafayette Jeff during a football game Friday, Oct. 2, 2015, at RHS.
