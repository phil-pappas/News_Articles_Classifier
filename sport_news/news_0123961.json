Cozens on October 13,   \nThe John Jay girls tennis team is hosting the Conference I tournament for the first time this week, starting today at 3 on the new courts on the John Jay campus. \nThe Indians, coming off an 11-0 regular season, have nine of 11 starting players qualified for the tourney, which concludes on Friday. They have more players in the tourney than any other team in the 21-school conference. \nTop singles player Anya Ivenitsky is seeded second in the singles draw, while the Indians’ other two singles players, Bailey Burke and Tatiana Blechman, are joining forces to play doubles. \nThree other doubles teams also qualified — Izzy Bienen and Sonia Lange, Callie Sacks and Acadia Thielking, and Nadia Shtohryn and Lily Gengler. \n“It’s going to be exciting,” said Coach Mike Racanelli. “Anya has a real good chance of making sectionals, and hopefully a few of the doubles teams do, too.” \nCaitlyn Ferrante of Yorktown is the top seed in the singles bracket. \nThe tournament features 16 singles players and 20 doubles teams. \nFive singles players and five doubles teams from each of the three conference tournaments will qualify for the Section 1 tournament, which starts next Tuesday at Harrison High School. Izzy Bienen plays a ball at the net during the first doubles matches of the John Jay girls tennis team’s win over Somers last Saturday at home. — J.B.
