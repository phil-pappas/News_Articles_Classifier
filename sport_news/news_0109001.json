(Image Source: David J. Phillip/AP Photo) \nJust as they’ve done throughout the series, the New York Mets jumped out to an early lead on the Chicago Cubs in Game 4. With two on and two out in the first inning, first baseman Lucas Duda drilled a shot over the centerfield wall to give the Mets a 3-0 lead. A lead that quickly turned to 4-0 when catcher Travis d’Arnaud made it back-to-back jacks with an opposite-field shot to right. \nThe Mets first baseman wasn’t done. Not by a long shot. With Cubs starter Jason Hammel already knocked out of the game, the man who came into Game 4 with three hits in 24 postseason at bats (.125) found himself at the dish again with two outs and two on facing left-handed reliever Travis Wood . Duda ripped a low line drive to right centerfield that split the outfielders for a two-out, two-run double and a 6-0 lead. He would add another double in the gap later in the game for three hits to match his total from New York’s first eight playoff games. \nWhile Duda, with five RBI’s to tie a franchise single-game postseason record, was the star of Game 4, it wouldn’t be a Mets playoff game without heroics from second baseman Daniel Murphy . With two opposite-field singles and a double in his first four at-bats, Murphy looked more like his vintage self. \nHe’s only hit 62 home runs in his career, including a career-high 14 this season. Murphy is not a slugger—really he isn’t it—but that didn’t stop him from turning a Fernando Rodney pitch around, 415-feet to centerfield, in the eighth inning to give the Mets an 8-1 lead. It was his seventh home run this postseason, extending his Mets record, and his sixth-straight playoff game with a round tripper, a Major League record. \n\"I can't explain it. It's such a blessing to contribute to what we've been able to do,\" Murphy said. \nMurphy, who’s time as a Met could be coming to an end this offseason—he’s a free agent to be—has gotten hot at the right time both for the team and himself. No one could be happier than third baseman David Wright , who is the longest-tenured player with one team and has finally made the World Series in his 11 th season wearing Orange & Blue. \n\"This is a long time coming,\" Wright said. \"We've been through some bad times. We've been through Septembers where you're just playing out the schedule, and that's no fun. To be able to completely reverse that 180 and now celebrate and get a chance to go to the World Series, I wish I could bottle it all. I really do. That's an emotion I'll never forget.\" \nThere were no bad times during the National League Championship Series, as the Mets dominated the Cubs in every facet of the game. They out-hit the Cubs. They out-pitched the Cubs. They out-fielded the Cubs. \n\"They did not let us up for air at any point,\" Chicago manager Joe Maddon said. \"Their domination of the early part of the game and their pitching was impressive.\" \nThe only cause for pause was a sore left shoulder, which took star slugger Yoenis Cespedes out of the game in the middle of the second inning. However, New York manager Terry Collins didn’t sound too concerned after the game. \n\"Cespedes' shoulder is going to be OK,\" Collins said. \"They didn't think there was any damage. They thought an injection would calm it down in a day, so he'll be ready.\" \nThe Mets will face the winner of the American League Championship Series between the Kansas City Royals and the Toronto Blue Jays in the World Series. Game 6 of the ALCS is Friday night in Kansas City with the Royals leading the series three games to two. The Mets will begin the World Series on the road next Tuesday, October 27. \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
