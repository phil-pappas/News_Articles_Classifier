The energy, the pained look on his face when he disagreed with calls. He was Danny.\nThe first time Danny Ainge saw Drazen Petrovic up close, he saw a talented player and someone who would eventually become a close friend.\nLast week, we had some fun with recollections of the Celtics’ trip to Madrid in 1988, but beyond all the goofy occurrences, Ainge came away from the two games in the McDonald’s Open with an appreciation for Petrovic, then the main attraction for Real Madrid.\nThe memories are bittersweet for Ainge, who got to play with Petrovic on the Trail Blazers and watched him later become a star with the Nets. The Celtics director of basketball operations remains deeply saddened by Petrovic’s 1993 death in a car accident in Germany.\nBut while the Celts played the Yugoslavian national team in the first doubleheader in Madrid that year, Ainge made sure to catch the 6-foot-5 guard’s performance in Real Madrid’s win over Scavolini Pesaro.\n“I was really intrigued by him watching him play in the first game,” Ainge said. “I had read and heard about him and how dominant he was over there in Europe. He’d had 60-point games and something like a 40-point average in a five- or six-game stretch. I remember just really being impressed with him and the players.”\nPetrovic would eventually get to the NBA, but he got lost in the Blazers’ veteran backcourt shuffle. He would emerge after being sent to the then-New Jersey Nets, averaging 20.6 and 22.3 points in his two full seasons there (1991-92 and ’93-93). He shot .446 on 3-pointers in that stretch.\nAinge and Petrovic were Blazers teammates for part of the 1990-91 season.\n“When I got traded to Portland (from Sacramento), Drazen and I developed a very special relationship,” Ainge said. “We spent a ton of time together during that season, post-practice, pre-practice, on the road. We had a lot of meals together.\n“I think it started with just how much I respected him. Like I said, I’d read about him, but then seeing him in the McDonald’s Open just made me like him so much more as a player.”\nWhen Ainge came to the Celtics, he had to tone down his game from the college days when he could fire it up whenever he wished. On a team with Larry Bird and Robert Parish, Kevin McHale, Tiny Archibald and, eventually, Dennis Johnson, he had to fit in.\nPetrovic, on the other hand, was becoming more and more a focal point.\n“He wasn’t a great defender in the NBA and didn’t have that great speed, but he did really understand the offensive game of basketball, and he was a great competitor,” Ainge said. “He was a much better competitor than people realized, because of his offensive flair and his charisma and his shooting ability. He was a much more intense competitor than I think people in the NBA realized. He definitely was a fierce, competitive kid. As much as any player I’ve ever been around, basketball was everything to him.\n“Did I ever tell you the stationary bike story?” Ainge added. “Well, when I went to training camp with him in Portland, one day we had a morning session and we stayed after and shot. Then we got some take-home lunch and went over to his apartment, because we didn’t have much time between practices. He got on his stationary bike, and I fell asleep on a beanbag chair.\n“When I woke up, he was still on his stationary bike. Then an hour later we were back at the gym. That’s how driven he was.\n“He was really dedicated to the game and put a lot of pressure on himself to live up to the great potential that he had. I’m glad that he had that amazing year with New Jersey after he got traded from Portland. Everybody could see the potential in him in Portland, but just because they had (Clyde) Drexler and (Terry) Porter, there wasn’t the opportunity for him to shine like he could.\n“I definitely think he would have eventually been an All-Star player in the NBA.”\nThis week’s C’s timeline\nWednesday at Brooklyn, 7:30 p.m. — The Celtics finally get a chance to play a preseason game against an NBA team, and it is against an opponent that the club and its fans will be following closely this year. With the Celts owning the Nets’ first-round draft pick, Greenhearts may be rooting as hard against Brooklyn as they do for the C’s.\nFriday at New York, 7:30 p.m. — The Knicks are looking a bit better so far in the latest year of Phil Jackson’s franchise makeover. And everyone is interested in getting a look at No. 4 overall draft pick Kristaps Porzingis.\nNBA EXECUTIVES TAKE NOTE OF MISSTEPS BY NFL’S GOODELL\nVeteran NBA front office executives we’ve spoken to recently are bewildered at the way NFL commissioner Roger Goodell handled the ball-pressure issue with Tom Brady and the Patriots. And it looked even worse to them in contrast to the NBA.\nSaid one exec: “I can’t believe this became an actual ‘incident.’ I’m sure Adam (Silver, the current commissioner) would handle it right, but I know what (former commissioner) David (Stern) would have done. As soon as there was a question or complaint raised by another team, David would have been on the phone (to the accused club) saying, ‘Here’s what I’m being told. If this is going on, it stops now.’ That’s it. Over and done.”\nAnother longtime exec agreed, saying: “Teams are always trying to work the edges. I’m not saying that’s what the Patriots were doing. In fact, the more I saw about it with the science and all that, I don’t think anyone can really say one way or the other there was a, Quote: , crime here.\n“But as I’m watching this I keep wondering about Goodell. How can he let something so small dominate the talk about his league for all these months? This was nothing, and then he does that crazy (Wells) Report and puts more wood on the fire. You know, the NFL people always talk about protecting the shield. Well, tell me how turning an equipment question into a court case helps anyone.\n“People should have been talking about that great Super Bowl and how teams were going to beat out New England and Seattle this year. Instead, Goodell lets this become the story? Crazy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:22:22.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
