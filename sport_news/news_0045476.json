It begins with a double-header today at 12 p.m, with a poten- tial third game to follow. \n“I am so proud of the way we battled and have played this year,” said Heritage head coach Ron Groover. “Loganville has been a power for several years and to come away with a victory is big.” \nEven Heritage head football coach D.J. Clay broke off Wednesday’s practice a little bit early to allow his team to celebrate with their classmates. \nClay, who has coached the girls basketball team to two straight Final Four appearances, feels a strong connection too many of the players on the softball team. \n“It’s all about family here at Heritage,” he said. “We all pull for each other. The fact that it was against Loganville makes it really special. That’s who we also play in football (on the road) this week. It is becoming a big rivalry between the two schools. I am so proud of these girls.” \nHeritage opened the game with two-run rallies in its first two at bats before adding an insurance run in the sixth. \nLoganville scored single runs in the sixth and seventh, but the rally attempt was squelched by stellar defense from the Lady Hawks. \nJunior pitcher Autumn Rochester allowed six hits, striking out four without surrendering a walk in the victory. \nKarlee Groover helped pace the offense with a 2-for-4 performance, including a double and two RBIs. She also scored a run. \nSister Kara Groover also had two hits including a double and scored twice. \nK.T. Heggood and Becca Henson also had two hits, with Henson adding an RBI. \n“These girls have put in so much time and sacrifice,” Groover said. “Most them are juggling a couple of sports. They are really dedicated. The good thing is we are home as long as we keep winning or go to the Final Four.” \nRochester set the tone for her pitching performance against Loganville with a 10-strikeout, two-hit victory against Trinity on Monday. Rochester also helped her cause with an RBI against the Lady Lions. \nHeggood smacked two hits, including a double against Trinity while Karlee Groover also had an RBI double. Henson added a two-hit effort. \nAccording to GISA policy, admis- sion to today’s first-round series is $7 for adults and $4 for students. \nOLA 8, NORTHGATE 4: When it comes to softball rivalries, Region 4- foes Ola and Northgate have had its share of intense games over the past three seasons, including one in the 2013 Class state finals. \nBut Wednesday’s region showdown in McDonough had a little less drama than usual. \nThe Lady Vikings hurt themselves with four errors and fell to 12-12-1 overall and 7-5 in region play. Ola improved to 17-8 and 11-2 in 4- . \nNorthgate scored twice in top of the second inning, starting with Sadie Proctor’s RBI single to score Myriah Render for a 1-0 lead. Morgan Runyans later drew a bases-loaded walk to plate teammate Jessica Cochran. \nOla, however, rallied back with five runs in the third, two in the fifth and one in the sixth to grab an 8-2 advantage. The Lady Vikings put together a final rally in the seventh, scoring twice when Kelsey Williston and Alyssa Allen drove in runs before Ola pitched out of the inning. \nWilliston, Proctor and Allen each had two hits. \nBoth teams finished with 10 hits. \nNorthgate pitcher Kaitlin Bailey and Brittany Trammell each split three innings in the loss. Bailey gave up five runs, four hits and had a strikeout. Trammell yielded three runs on six hits with a strikeout. \nKyla Draper picked up the win for Ola and Laura Couch finished with four RBIs, including a homer.
