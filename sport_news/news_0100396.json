Husker fans haven't lost their love for winning Tyler Dahlgren Tyler Dahlgren \nJack Gangwish after the win at Minnesota on Saturday. \nEchoes of “Go Big Red” rang from the southwest corner of an otherwise-empty TCF Bank Stadium as Husker football players made their way through the tunnel after a 48-25 win at Minnesota. \nSome raised their hands up in the air and smiled at the crowd. Some took time to soak the moment in. Nearly every single player slapped hands with overjoyed fans on the way out. \nIt was a familiar yet unfamiliar site. This team had fallen on so much hard luck, four heart-crushing losses in six weeks, that a road win over an unrated Minnesota team had the folks in red transported to yesteryear, when the Huskers handled their business like this almost every week. \nAs I watched the scene in front of me, I had a thought. \nThis program may have derailed 14 years ago, and currently it might be lost somewhere far off the beaten path. But the fans of Nebraska football haven't forgotten how to win, and they sure haven't lost their love for it. \nThere's still pride there. Lots of it. Why else would thousands and thousands of fans make a six-hour drive to cheer on a 2-4 team? Why else will Memorial Stadium be packed to the brim this Saturday for the Northwestern game? \nThere's a younger generation that doesn't remember the glory years. I hardly do myself, though I remember being disturbingly upset when it was announced that Nebraska would have to split the title in '97. \nAnd that might not be such a bad thing. Tommie Frazier isn't coming back, and neither is Tom Osborne or 1994. Nebraska football might be in need of a good ole' re-branding, but that doesn't mean the fan base should change a thing. \nOn the contrary. Nebraskans support for their program doesn't mean they are stuck in the stone age or unwilling to move past the past. \nJust look at the scene in Minneapolis on Saturday. Their team had just improved to 3-4, and they couldn't have been any prouder or more fired up. \nNebraska football has a past to be proud about, but if I learned anything from my trip north, it's that they still love winning in the present. ×", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:14:29.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
