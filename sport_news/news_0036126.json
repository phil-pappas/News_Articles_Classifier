The IHSA announced that its board of directors met and voted to move to a two-class system in both boys and girls tennis beginning with the 2016-17 school year. \"This has been my platform for the last three years,\" said Watson, who is the only Southern Illinois representative on the Illinois High School Tennis Coaches Association board of directors. \"I'm just overjoyed by this. Tennis has had a state series for 100 years with Chicago dominating. Now the small schools have a chance to succeed and now more schools will want to participate.\" Under the future system, Marion's Logan Bennett would have played in the singles semifinals this past spring rather than placing 83rd, Watson determined. The IHSA released a statement Wednesday saying that its board reviewed the results of a survey that was completed by IHSA member school representatives this fall. Of the 265 respondents to the survey, over 76 percent (203) supported adding a second class, the statement said, adding that the IHSA has 338 total member schools that currently field a tennis team, while the state tournament series entries in 2014-15 were 311 schools entering in girls and 293 in boys. \"The idea for adding a second class has gained momentum in the tennis community over the past year,\" IHSA executive director Marty Hickman said in the press release. \"Our membership provided valid reasons for and against expansion, which the board weighed carefully, but ultimately the survey reinforced that our schools would like to see a second class added. The board feels like this is a decision that positively impacts the student-athletes and the sport.\" Watson said the tennis coaches association she is a member of pushed the survey forward and pleaded with sectional schools to complete it. As many as six alternate suggestions were presented and Watson's suggestion of splitting the series was ultimately adopted. According to the press release, under the new two-class format the state final tournament will have the same total number of qualifiers (128) as it did in the one-class era, with 64 singles and doubles players qualifying in each class. Sectionals will also be split, with the 32 total sectionals that existed in the one-class system becoming 16 Class A Sectionals and 16 Class AA Sectionals, the release said. \"They're splitting it down the middle and the argument against it was always that they didn't want two different locations or separate weekends,\" Watson said. \"But one of my proposals was you can still host it in Chicago and everyone can still come and have a bonding experience.\" The class enrollment break will be determined based on placing the smallest 50 percent of the participating schools in Class A and the remaining half in Class AA, the IHSA's release said. Based on the 2014-15 entries, the classification cutoffs would have been 1378 for girls and 1427 for boys, the IHSA determined.

We just celebrated the 100th year of the state tennis tournament and it's been one class that entire time. It's about time for this.
