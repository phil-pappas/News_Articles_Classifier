If the Mets win, it'll be required that you have four ridiculous young starting pitchers on the same staff.\n\"If the Royals win, you need to have speed and athleticism and contact up and down your lineup. If the Blue Jays win, you need to fill your lineup with right-handed epic mashers and make a huge trade at the deadline.\n\"That's the only thing I can say with certainty. This game is too nuanced and too complicated for there to be any one way,\" he said.\nSince baseball shifted to the best-of-seven LCS format in 1969, only 3 of 25 teams that have fallen behind 2-0 rallied to advance to the World Series.\nThe odds certainly do not favor the Cubs, but this team has been defying percentages all season.\nThe Cubs figure to respond to being back at home, where the weather will be warmer this week and the baseball will be traveling farther.\n\"I think the series is far from over,\" Epstein said. \"I'd be shocked if this is how we're going out. It's not representative of the talent and character we have in this clubhouse. I think we'll show a lot better baseball over the course of this series. They're still really confident, as am I.\"\nWhen Epstein was with Boston, the Red Sox were down 3-0 to the New York Yankees in the 2004 ALCS. They rallied to win four straight and went on to win the World Series for the first time since 1918.\n\"There's a reason they make these important series long,\" Epstein said. \"We've always responded, all year long. We've had a winning streak after a stretch of poor play. We plan on playing well at home.\n\"It was kind of a very forgettable first two games from a number of points. They pitched really well right out of the shoot. I think we probably hit more balls hard than they did. Give them credit, but we haven't really played our game yet.\"\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
