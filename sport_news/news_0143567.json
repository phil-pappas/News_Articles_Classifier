Craig Davis Contact Reporter South Florida Sun Sentinel Miami Marlins reportedly have 'serious interest' in Don Mattingly as next manager. \nWith Don Mattingly out as manager in Los Angeles, speculation has quickly focused on him as a prime candidate to become the next skipper of the Miami Marlins. \nThat possibility surfaced in early September even as Mattingly was leading the Dodgers to their third consecutive National League West title. The former Yankees star first baseman is known to be a favorite of Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria, a New York native. \nMattingly and the Dodgers parted ways Thursday in the wake of the club’s first-round loss to the Mets in the playoffs. He has one year left on his contract. \nThe Marlins have been moving slowly in their search for a manager to replace Dan Jennings, who has returned to his role as general manager. They have interviewed four candidates, but no apparent favorite for the job have emerged, and there have been indications Marlins officials were waiting for Mattingly’s future with the Dodgers to be resolved. \nJon Heyman, of CBS Sports tweeted Thursday, “Marlins have serious interest in Mattingly. Their search appeared to be on semi-hold, waiting for this.” \nIt is unknown whether Mattingly would be receptive to overtures to lead the Marlins under Loria, who is known to change managers as often as the sheets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:57:45.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
