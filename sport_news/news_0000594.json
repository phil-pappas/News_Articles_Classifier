Both sides lost their opening games in Group D. \nLars Stindl opened the scoring in the 54th for the home side, which was playing European Cup football at home for the first time in 37 years, only for Nicolas Otamendi to equalize with a deflected effort in the 65th after Martin Demichelis' initial attempts was hooked out by a defender. \nJuventus defeated Sevilla 2-0 in the other group game. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:20:34.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
