Charleston’s Gerlick A True Tiger Times Record • ktaylor@swtimes.com \nCHARLESTON — Somewhere, in one of those imaginary dictionaries all coaches talk about, there’s a picture of Wade Gerlick wearing a Charleston Tigers’ uniform. \nHe’s as true a Tiger as they’ve ever had. \n“There’s nothing like Charleston Tigers football — it’s one of a kind,” beams Gerlick, a jack-of-all-trades senior who hasn’t missed a game since the first time he put on a pair of shoulder pads in the seventh grade. \nGerlick grew up in the shadows of yesterdays great Charleston teams. Former coach Doug Loughridge asked him to be a ‘water boy’ when he was in elementary school. \n“Me and coach Loughridge are good friends, and when I was a little kid I was a water boy for the team; I dreamed about playing here,” Gerlick said. “I went to every practice and watched them. I always wanted to be a Tiger.” \nGerlick hasn’t disappointed. Although he won’t graduate with a zillion yards, he has done more than coach Greg Kendrick could have asked for. \nThrough five games, the two-way star has rushed for 315 yards and eight touchdowns. But for two games, Gerlick stepped in at quarterback, passing for 178 yards on 21 of 35 passing attempts. \n“I actually played quarterback when I was in the seventh grade and the eighth grade,” Gerlick said. “It was a change; it was different going from linebacker and running back to quarterback, but it was definitely a fun experience.” \nGerlick acutally completed 14 of 19 passes for 89 yards as a sophomore backup to Ty Storey. He didn’t throw a pass in 2014. \n“He’s been an invaluable leader and an invaluable football player since the ninth grade,” Kendrick said. “I don’t think he’s missed a start. He’s a coach on the field. If we had 12 kids like that, you would have something special.” \nCharleston (4-2, 3-0) beat Two Rivers on Friday for its third 3A-4 victory in as many games. \n“We’ve just got to continue doing what we do every day,” Gerlick said. “We have to stay focused; we have to stay hungry.” \nThe Tigers, who’ve won five state championships since 2004, have been blessed with one star athlete after another for the better part of 10 seasons. \nGerlick has become part of that genre, though his career rushing yards (907) and receiving yards (781) aren’t the stuff of statues. \nJust don’t tell that to Kendrick. \n“I’ve coached kids with more athletic ability, but I’ve never coached a kid with more guts and heart and character,” Kendrick said. “He carried us offensively in the second half against Prairie Grove and against Ozark. We had some players out of position, and he simply took it upon his shoulders and was a man amongst boys.” \n“The first couple of games are usually hard; we have some cramping issues,” he said. “(But) we do a really good job of conditioning in the summer.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T13:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:46:15.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
