The hospital has not released any information on his condition.\nDispatchers received three calls from Dennis Hof’s Love Ranch in Crystal, Nev., on Tuesday afternoon. The first came from an employee identified by authorities as Mitsie John, and the subsequent two were from Richard Hunter, the media director for the ranch.\nA panicked John told the dispatcher, “All I know is that he’s close to not breathing.”\nShe added that paramedics needed “to hurry, please, because he has blood coming out of his nose, white stuff coming out of his mouth.”\nHunter told authorities that Odom “had some cocaine on him that he finished on Saturday.”\nOn Tuesday, Hof told the Register that police did not find any drugs in Odom’s room. Authorities declined to answer questions about what they found at the Love Ranch, because they are still actively investigating.\nHof said he did not know if Odom used cocaine over the next three days.\n“Hopefully, one had nothing to do with the other there,” Hunter said.\nOdom arrived at the Love Ranch on Saturday, Hof said, because he “just wanted to get away.”\nHunter spoke to the dispatcher while in the room with Odom, and with the help of other employees, followed instructions to turn Odom on his side.\n“He is breathing regularly,” Hunter said. “He sounds like he’s snoring a little bit. He is breathing consistently. He’s got a little bit of fluid coming out of his nose and his mouth.”\nHof told the Register that Odom was visited early Tuesday morning by two female employees. They returned around 3:30 p.m., when they found him unresponsive.\nSheriff Sharon A. Wehrly declined to say whether authorities believed Odom overdosed. Detective Michael Eisenloffel said authorities had not ruled out the possibility of a suicide attempt.\n1 2 3 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:31:20.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
