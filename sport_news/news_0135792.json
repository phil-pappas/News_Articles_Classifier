Once you get your team working together, anything is possible, really.” \nLast week, the Firebirds ran the ball for 334 yards against a top defense, but were especially proud of their defense for posting a shutout in the second half. \n“We finally played to what we amount to really,” junior safety Zion Bowlin said. “All the athletes came together. All the line started growing (up).” \nThe Firebirds will face the Raiders (0-5), who are coached by Brett Oberzan, an 11-year assistant coach for Free State before taking the job at SM South during the last offseason. \nIt’s not a game that FSHS coach Bob Lisher looks forward to when he sees a familiar face on the opposing sideline. \n“We’re friends and we’re going to be friends, but during the game, neither one of us is going to be friends,” Lisher said. “We’re going to try to win the football game. Coach Oberzan will have his guys prepared. I know they will play hard. I know they will be well-coached and he’ll do the best he can with what he’s got, just like we will.” \nHowever, most of the Firebirds are excited to see Oberzan again, their former defensive coordinator. \n“It’ll be fun playing against him because he knows all our offense,” Sanders said. “He’s been here for a bunch of years. It’ll just be fun playing against that because we know he’s going to prepare his team harder than he has.” \nBeyond the reunion of their former coach, the Firebirds are focused on carrying their momentum from their last two wins. \n“The first three games, we still hurt ourselves badly,” Lisher said. “We still had a chance to win the football game and we didn’t. Now that’s old news. We have to build on what we’ve done the last two weeks and continue to get better.” \nFSHS probable starters \nOffense \nLT — Chase Houk, jr. LG — Jay Dineen, jr.
