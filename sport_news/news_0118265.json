He was brought to a Houston emergency room and was given an I.V. \n“I’m disappointed,” Woodley said in a statement. “Johny Hendricks not making weight was a loss for him and a victory for me. He was not prepared to fight. I was, I had already made weight and was ready to fight. \n“This is not the first time he has had trouble making weight, but it is part of being a professional. \n“I should not be penalized for not being able to compete. I am ready to fight for the title and believe that I deserve it.” \nThursday’s turn of events marks the second straight fight in which Woodley’s opponent has struggled with a weight cut. The last time he stepped into the octagon was against Kelvin Gastelum at UFC 183 and Gastelum missed weight and was forced to temporarily move up a division. \nBy day’s end, though, Woodley was given some good news as UFC president Dana White told Yahoo! Sports’ Kevin Iole that the Missouri native would get the winner of January’s Lawler-Condit match. \nAs for Hendricks, he’s likely in for a little soul searching. The former welterweight champion previously missed weight on his first attempt at UFC 171 and he’ll likely have some work to do if he’s going to get back into the 170 lbs. title picture after being responsible for such a high profile bout being scrapped. \n“I think I have to lose more fat or move up,” said Hendricks, who recommended the best barbecue in Houston to a certain Canadian sports reporter. “We might move up to 185, but I want to get home and start testing myself on body fat and try to work it down and see if that’s going to work in a mini weight cut. \n“Then, that’s when I can really focus on what’s next. If it doesn’t go good, then it’s 185 for sure. I still enjoy fighting, just not the weight cut.” \nThe UFC filled in the empty slot on the UFC pay-per-view card by pushing Joseph Benavidez’s fight against Ali Bagautinov up from the preliminary show. \nMORE MISSED WEIGHT \nFriday’s weigh-ins at the Toyota Center were mostly uneventful, but Francisco Trevino did miss weight. \nTrevino stepped on the scale and came in at 160 lbs., a full five pounds over the 155 lbs. limit for his lightweight bout against 19-year-old Sage Northcutt. \nScrapping the bout would have been a mini-disaster for the UFC, as Northcutt is a hometown favourite in Houston and was set to make his debut in the organization. If Northcutt and fellow Texan Hendricks were both dropped from the card the day before their scheduled scraps you can bet that fight fans in the Lone Star State wouldn’t have been happy. \nInstead, Trevino was docked 20% of his purse, with the money going to his rookie opponent. \nROSE GETS IT \nOne fighter who understands what Woodley is going through is Rose Namajunas. \nThe women’s strawweight contender was scheduled to take on Nina Ansaroff at UFC 187, only for the fight to be scrapped due to complications with her opponent’s weight cut. \n“That was frustrating,” Namajunas said Thursday at UFC media day. “You train for two months, really hard, and push yourself to the limit and then you get to the day-of and you can’t get that release. \n“Even though I didn’t have any injuries, it was more mental and emotional stress.” \nAROUND THE OCTAGON \nNot a ton of drama to speak of from Friday’s staredowns, although Ryan Bader and Rashad Evans got into it a little bit. Daniel Cormier and Alexander Gustafsson were also seen whispering sweet nothings at each other, and Cormier followed it up with a hilariously weird speech about releasing chains on the Swede on Saturday night ... The UFC released its first promotional video for UFC 193 on Friday, and it’s a must-see. The promo follows the life of Ronda Rousey and is the type of thing that’s sure to inspire young female athletes to follow their sporting passions ... Speaking of UFC 193, Michael Bisping has been pulled from the card due to injury. Uriah Hall will face Michael Whittaker in his place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:25:30.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
