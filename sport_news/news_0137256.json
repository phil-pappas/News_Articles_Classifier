They've won four EL titles and despite the constant turnover that minor league teams undergo on a constant basis, the RubberDucks have been as consistent as any team in the league. Their playoff push came up short this season, as a five-game losing streak in the final two weeks of the season dashed their postseason hopes. Akron ultimately finished one game out of the wild card spot in the EL Western Division, but general manager Jim Pfander is happy with what he saw both from this year's RubberDucks and from club alumni now in the majors. \"Probably the greatest thing we saw was three of our guys who were on our opening day roster in 2014 and even Cody Anderson who was with us this year, to see them starting and playing significant time with the Indians,\" Pfander said. Pfander pointed to Goevany Urshela and Francisco Lindor, now anchoring the left side of the infield for the Indians, as two players RubberDucks fans were able to see and cheer before they reached the majors. This year's RubberDucks showcased many hoping to follow in Lindor and Urshela's shoes. Third baseman Yandy Diaz was selected to both the midseason and postseason EL All-Star teams, batting .315, tallying 150 hits and providing solid defense at the hot corner. \"Yandy was one of the most consistent guys in the lineup all season and he was really a fun guy to watch,\" Pfander said. Another player who made an impact at the plate was first baseman Nellie Rodriguez, a 6-foot-2, 225-pound slugger who blasted a grand slam in his first at bat with Akron. Rodriguez struggled as his time with the RubberDucks wore on and Pfander speculated that as AA pitchers figured him out late in the season, it led to Rodriguez needing to make adjustments of his own entering next season. Center field has been stage for some of the brightest prospects in the Indians system to shine at Canal Park and this season was no different. Tyler Naquin, Cleveland's top pick in the 2012 MLB draft, played in Akron last season and made a brief return this season, ultimately ceding his spot to 2014 top pick Bradley Zimmer late in the season. Zimmer started fast, earning EL Player of the Week honros in his third week with the team. He hit hit six home runs and had 24 RBI in 49 games with the RubberDucks and while it's to be determined if he begins next season in Akron or is promoted to Columbus, Pfander was excited by what he saw from Zimmer. \"You see a guy that tall and he isn't supposed to be that fast or hit with that much power,\" Pfander said. \"He's so long that he seems like he just takes four or five steps and he's stolen second base. I'm excited to see where he goes next year.\" Page 2 of 2 - The pitching staff was the RubberDucks for most of the season and closer Jeff Johnson, another EL All-Star, was the linchpin. He was named the player of the week for the entire organization at one point in the season and after notching a 1.05 ERA and 27 saves, he earned rave reviews from the team's coaching staff and front office. \"Every time he got in the game, it seemed like he got the job done,\" Pfander said. \"He's a guy who you knew the game was over when he came in, even if he got a man on base or got into trouble.\" Josh Martin thrived in a setup role for Johnson, amassing an 8-1 record with a 2.27 ERA while striking out 1.2 batters per inning. Pfander noted that when he first started working in minor league baseball, relief pitchers were often failed starters exiled to the bullpen as a last resort. Now, pitchers such as Martin are specialists who have defined roles and work in relief their entire careers. Johnson, Martin and many members of this year's team played together either in Akron or elsewhere in previous seasons. Their playoff push under manager Dave Wallace may have come up short, but Pfander and the rest of the front office were glad to see the organization's young talent go through the experience together. \"I spent eight years in New York Yankees organization working in Charleston and the Yankees were the first team that wanted to make sure players were together for stretch run, working toward winning,\" Pfander said.\"It's all about player development normally and let's do what's best for the players' growth, but they were the first team that wanted young guys to get used to winning together.\" Winning together has become a staple for the RubberDucks dating back to their days as the Aeros and the 2015 season provided plenty of exciting moments and glimpses of the future for the team and its fans.
