The capital outfit are one of only two teams to still hold an unbeaten record in the La Liga, but back-to-back draws against Malaga and Atletico Madrid have ratcheted up the pressure on coach Rafael Benitez. \nCarvajal, Pepe, James Rodriguez, Luka Modric and Karim Benzema are all sidelined through injury for the visit of Levante. Sergio Ramos (shoulder) has returned to training while full-back Danilo (foot) could also feature. \nLevante secured their first win of the season before the international break, toppling leaders Villarreal 1-0 at home through a late Deyverson winner. The Valencian side only have six points from their seven matches and remain mired in the relegation zone. \nDefenders Ivan Lopez and David Navarro and midfielder Verza are all doubtful for the trip to the Spanish capital. \nWhat managers say \nRafael Benitez : \"There's no problem between Cristiano [Ronaldo] and [Gareth] Bale at Real Madrid, everything tends to get magnified â€“ sometimes because of jealousy or to attack the club, and that surprises me. I always send the players text messages when they are with their national sides, there is no problem at all between them.\" \nLucas Alcaraz : \"It has been a very important victory [against Villarreal], but the ones I'm glad for is the players and the fans. On other days we have not been able to win for one reason or another and today we have. I leave with the feeling that the players have been great.\" \nForm guide Real Madrid (all competitions): DWDWW Last result: Atletico Madrid 1-1 Real Madrid Levante : WLDLD Last result: Levante 1-0 Villarreal \nBetting odds (888sport)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T10:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:32:26.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
