He's more excited this year and has big plans for us. We can't worry about what happens in the future. We have to take care of today.\"\nIt's true the UNLV team that was picked to finish fourth in the Mountain West on Tuesday is the best and deepest Rice has offered with the Rebels, one that will play a style at both ends he has desired since replacing Lon Kruger once the latter departed for the Big 12 Conference riches of Oklahoma.\nThe fifth-year senior Seagears and McCaw joined Rice at the conference media day inside the Renaissance, where Stephen Zimmerman became the fourth straight UNLV player to be voted the league's preseason Freshman of the Year and a majority feeling about the team's season-long prospects went something like this: Prove it.\nThat's fair. It makes sense. UNLV has averaged over 22 wins under Rice, but has never finished higher than was it has been predicted in the Mountain West.\nThe Rebels were picked second in his first three years and finished third each time.\nThey were picked fourth last season and finished seventh, missing the NCAAs for the second straight year.\nThey can't miss again this season, not if there is any internal hope that the journey will continue under Rice.\n\"There was pressure when I first got the job and only had three years on my contract,\" Rice said. \"There is pressure now. It's the nature of being at a program with great tradition and high expectations. I want our players to enjoy the experience and not worry about me.\n\"I'm better now now than when I got the job. I have learned lessons. I take responsibility and accountability for the mistakes I've made. Experience is a great teacher. It certainly has been to me. We weren't as good as we needed to be last year in conference play and I take responsibility for that. We lost a lot of close games and we need to be tougher. That was the emphasis coming out of losing to San Diego State in the conference tournament. We need to be tougher.\"\nIn the world of schedule strengths and Ratings Percentage Index and those factors studied intently by the NCAA Tournament selection committee, Rice as much as anyone in the Mountain West has scheduled aggressively for non-conference matchups.\nHe annually plays a handful of games against some of the best programs from Power 5 leagues, and yet UNLV's toughest test this season might come at Wichita State on Dec. 9. The Rebels also play UCLA (and maybe Kansas) in the Maui Invitational, host Arizona State, travel to Arizona and meet Oregon in a neutral court game at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.\nIt is all part of Rice's plan — that and using his depth to press every possession and run each time opportunity arises — to make certain the Rebels hear their named called come Selection Sunday.\nIt's a sound plan, a doable one to execute.\nUNLV has a chance to be really good.\nAnd, well, needs to be for its coach.\n\"I use the phrase the, 'proliferation of the NCAA Tournament,' where there has been such value placed on post-season and in many respects for good reason,\" Rice said. \"But sometimes, it undervalues the great accomplishment of winning a regular-season league title. You think about in our league, playing 18 games over the course of 2-3 months, that's a tremendous achievement.\n\"And yet, it has just become a situation in our game where what you do in those first few weeks in March is the most important thing. It's just how it is, and everyone knows it.\"\nHe knows it, and understands what is on the line should the Rebels fail to reach such a stage. It's the reality of major college basketball in 2015.\nBut so is this: The Rebels have arguably never been more talented and promising under him, which is a pretty good position to be in when trying to avoid getting permanently burned by that seat.\nEd Graney can be reached at egraney@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-4618.
