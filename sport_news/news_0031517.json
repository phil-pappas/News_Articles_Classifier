The number of arrests and disciplinary referrals for alcohol and drug violations at CU have been declining, for the most part, since 2011.\n\"You have conversations about 'do certain things need to be criminalized?' \" she said. \"Do we need to criminalize certain behavior if it's minor criminal behavior? Do we need to send a student through the court process, put their financial aid at risk, put their future admission to graduate school at risk?\"\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:04:37.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
