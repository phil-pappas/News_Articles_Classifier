Niumatalolo admitted the back-and-forth mixture of option and conventional plays makes the Falcons difficult to defend. \n\"They do a good job of employing both. They get you into option mode then hit you in the mouth. You hunker down and get ready for the power stuff and they get the ball on the perimeter,\" he said. \nAir Force uses a slew of formations to disguise its intent, making Making the job of interim defensive coordinator Dale Pehrson even tougher. Niumatalolo called it \"window dressing\" or \"eye candy\" and noted the Falcons run the same schemes out of all the various formations. \n\"Air Force has a ton of formations. Usually they stay with the ones they come into the game with, but you really don't know what to prepare for,\" Pehrson said. \"They've had a million formations over the years so you can never be sure what you'll see. We try to categorize the formations for our players to make it a little easier to digest. They do a really good job of running the same plays out of different looks.\" \nPehrson said the biggest challenge for the coaching staff during Air Force week is to train the defensive players to focus on and trust their keys. In past meetings, the Falcons have hit big plays when certain defenders were fooled by formations or motion. \n\"Your eyes are everything in this game. That is the number one key. If you're not using your eyes correctly you're going to have problems,\" Pehrson said. \"If something bad happens it's because somebody didn't have their eyes in the right place.\" \nKarson Roberts will get his second start at quarterback on Saturday and does not figure to be overwhelmed by the atmosphere surrounding a service academy contest on the road. Roberts, who took over after Nate Romine suffered a season-ending knee injury on Sept. 12 against San Jose State, started against Navy in Annapolis as a sophomore in 2013. \nAir Force, like Navy, has a pair of fullbacks who are the centerpiece of the offense. Starter D.J. Johnson (5-10, 235) leads the team in rushing with 210 yards while Shayne Davern (6-0, 240) has been effective in a relief role, averaging 5.3 yards per carry. \n\"Both fullbacks are good. They are kind of like matches to our guys. They're big and physical and run hard,\" Pehrson said. \nTailback Jacobi Owens (6-0, 202) is the most dynamic weapon in the Air Force arsenal, a strong runner with breakaway speed. Owens amassed 1,054 rushing yards last season despite missing three games with an injury. \nJalen Robinette (6-4, 215) is a dangerous downfield target while fellow wide receiver Garrett Brown is a two-way threat who is often used in the running game. \n\"It's basically the same group that came out here a couple years ago. They're just older and more experienced now,\" Pehrson said. \"They have a really good offense; so we'll have our work cut out for us.\" \nAir Force figures to have its own problems containing the Navy offense that is orchestrated so well by quarterback Keenan Reynolds and features a pair of powerful fullbacks in Chris Swain (6-1, 245) and Quentin Ezell (6-1, 253). \nSwain leads the team in rushing with 307 yards, two more than Reynolds. Ezell has contributed 122 rushing yards while DeBrandon Sanders has been the most productive member of the slotback corps, averaging 11 yards on 11 pitchouts. \n\"Navy has been exceptionally sound on offense and that's probably because they have so many seniors on that side of the ball,\" Calhoun said. \"There is some very good experience there.\" \nWhile Air Force and Navy may take different approaches to moving the ball, the results have been equally successful. The Falcons and Mids are tied for 22nd in the national rankings for scoring offense with 40.3 points per game. \nThis is the first leg of the three-way competition between Air Force, Army and Navy for the coveted Commander-in-Chief's Trophy. The Midshipmen won the trophy outright nine times between 2004 and 2013, but the Falcons reclaimed it last year for the third time since 2010. \nAIR FORCE @ NAVY", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:58:25.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
