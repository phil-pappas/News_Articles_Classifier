The negative sack yards are the reason Penn State’s box-score rushing total is 195, not 220. \nAs usual, Hack took some shots, and as usual he kept getting up. Even after sustaining a large gash on his left leg, he stayed in the game. \nAfter the game, he shrugged it off. \n“I just got a little banged up,’’ he said. “It’s all good.’’ \nWR Chris Godwin, responsible for both the 45-yard completion and a 56-yarder, also drew a pass interference call on a deep route, so those 15 yards amount to passing yards. \nIn a key early moment while leading 3-0, Hackenberg threw a perfect ball that TE Mike Gesicki dropped for what would likely have been a 30-plus yard play. \nThe Lions’ last gasp came when they had driven to the Ohio State 13, down 24-10 early in the fourth quarter. On fourth-and-two, Hackenberg was sacked after seemingly failing to see a wide-open Barkley. \n“(Barkley) was the fourth progression on the right side (of a play that looked left),’’ coach James Franklin said afterward. \n“He probably didn’t have time to get to the fourth progression.’’ \nSo we’re back to it. The offensive line. Again. \n“Obviously, as an offense against a great defense, we ran the ball pretty well,’’ tackle Andrew Nelson said. \n“We need to pass protect so much better. You can put that on me all day long.’’ Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:19:50.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
