While Modi was served a notice for allegedly \"bribing\" a section of voters in Bhabhua with the promise of TV sets, laptops and sarees/dhotis, Yadav got a notice for his alleged casteist appeals at a public meeting in Raghopur.\nIncidentally, the district administrations concerned have already filed an FIR against Yadav and Modi for the said offences.\nThe EC, in its notice to Modi, referred to a report received from Bihar chief electoral officer, confirming his September 28 statement at Bhabhua offering colour TV sets to Dalit and Mahadalit families. He was Quote: d as promising laptops to 50,000 meritorious matriculates and Class XII students. Besides, he promised a set of dhoti/saree to each poor family, while appealing to them to vote for the same party in Bihar as the one ruling at the Centre.\nCiting the model code that restrains parties and candidates to \"avoid scrupulously all activities which are 'corrupt practices' and offences under the election law,\" as well as Section 171(B) /171(E) of IPC and Section 123(1) of the Representation of the People's Act that equate voter inducement with bribery, the EC said Modi's offer prima facie violated the model code.\nModi has been asked to reply to EC notice by 3 pm on October 6.\nIn its notice to Lalu Yadav, the EC referred to his statements exhorting Yadavs to support him in the \"backwards Vs forwards\" fight. Yadav, while launching his campaign from Raghopur, had even made certain communal references with respect to cow and pig slaughter.\nStating that the model code restrained parties from aggravating mutual hatred between castes or communities, an activity also barred by Section 125 of the R P Act and Section 153A and 505(2) of IPC, the poll panel said Yadav's remarks were prima facie a violation of the model code.\nYadav has also been asked to explain his stand by 3 pm on October 6.
