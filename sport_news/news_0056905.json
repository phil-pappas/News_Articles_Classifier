HANS PENNINK — AP Breeders' Cup: Trainer says Beholder 'back in the game' after fever subsides \nThe first ever Breeders Cup hosted by Keeneland has already proven popular as 200 horses were pre-entered Wednesday, including 32 international contenders, for the two-day event taking place at the historic track Oct. 30-31. \nThis years total is just short of the record of 201 pre-entries recorded last year when the Breeders Cup was held at Santa Anita Park for a third consecutive year. A total of 13 races make up the Breeders Cup card. \nThe $5 million Breeders Cup Classic has 10 horses pre entered for the 1¼ miles test including Triple Crown winner American Pharoah and two-time Breeders Cup race winner Beholder. \nBeholder, winner of the 2012 Breeders Cup Juvenile Fillies sand 2013 Breeders Cup Distaff, is attempting to join Zenyatta as the only female runners to win the Classic. The 5-year-old Beholder, who spiked a slight fever Tuesday morning but was reported to be in good order by trainer Richard Mandella on Wednesday, will also aim to become the first horse to win three separate Breeders Cup races should the daughter of Henny Hughes start in the Classic. \nBeholder is also cross entered in the Distaff but has first preference for the Classic. \nOf the 13 Breeders Cup races, only the Classic, Turf, and Juvenile Fillies were not oversubscribed. A maximum of 14 starters are allowed in each of the races with the exception of the Dirt Mile which allows 12. \nThe Breeders Cup Juvenile Turf led all races with 27 horses pre-entered. The Turf Sprint, which had a record 29 horses pre-entered in 2014, has 19 pre-entered this season. \nEntries for all 13 Breeders Cup races will be Monday, Oct. 26 with the post-position draws later that day. \nThe official race order for Breeders Cup Friday is as follows: the $1 million Breeders Cup Juvenile Turf (3:30 p.m.); followed by the $1 million Breeders Cup Dirt Mile (4:10 p.m.); the $1 million Breeders Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf (4:50 p.m.); and the $2 million Breeders Cup Distaff (5:35 p.m.). \nThe race order for championship Saturday is as follows: $2 million Juvenile Fillies (12:05 p.m.); $1 million Breeders Cup Turf Sprint (12:45 p.m.); $1 million Breeders Cup Filly & Mare Sprint (1:25 p.m.); $2 million Breeders Cup Filly & Mare Turf (2:10 p.m.); $1.5 million Breeders Cup Sprint (2:50 p.m.), $2 million Breeders Cup Mile (3:30 p.m.); $2 million Breeders Cup Juvenile (4:10); $3 million Breeders Cup Turf (4:50 p.m.) and the $5 million Breeders Cup Classic (5:35 p.m.).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:51:36.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
