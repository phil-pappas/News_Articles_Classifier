Juliet Spies-Gans Editorial Fellow, HuffPost Sports Posted: 10/02/2015 10:43 AM EDT | Edited: 13 minutes ago \nIt’s been a month of strange headlines for James Harden. While the public has already recently questioned his ability to adequately endorse products and adequately handle his alcohol , Harden left us with the biggest question yet on Thursday night. \nFor the love of all that is holy, WHAT ARE THOSE ??? A closer look at the new #addidas James Harden shoes #Rockets #abc13sports pic.twitter.com/wHQCMN60Ze — David Nuño (@DavidNunoABC13) October 1, 2015 \nHarden’s shoes are Crest toothpaste-level white, bulky and kind of resemble a bolster pillow cushion . And while the arrival of a literal truckload of shoes at Harden’s house caused jealousy throughout the Twitterverse yesterday, the newly revealed design of the sneakers has shifted the Internet trolls’ jealousy to joy. \nJoy that they do not have to put on or promote the Pillsbury doughboys that are currently encasing Harden’s feet. It's only a matter of time before he gets the same \" What are those? \" ﻿treatment that his Airness Michael Jordan recently received. @Cody_Stoots @DavidNunoABC13 Those are terrible.
