Jonathan Frost and the county, says the officer was driving a new patrol car on Feb. 28 that had \"improperly bright or misaimed headlights, even on low beams.\" Deven Guilford, 17, who had been driving to his girlfriend's house after playing basketball at his church, was one of three drivers to flash their brights at the officer to get him to dim his lights, the suit says. Frost stopped all three drivers. Five minutes after Guilford was pulled over, the lawsuit says, the teen lay dead in the snow on the side of the road, struck by seven bullets. The county prosecutor said the teen fought with the deputy and was killed in \"justifiable self-defense.\" Guilford's parents said in a statement that video taken by the deputy's body camera turned their \"confusion\" to \"outrage.\"\"We always had great respect for law enforcement and the men and women who chose that profession in the past,\" Brian and Becky Guilford said. \"But we must say that belief has been shaken to the core by the actions of Frost and refusal of the Eaton County Prosecutor to hold Frost accountable. The failed criminal justice system forces us to seek other avenues for some kind of JUSTICE FOR DEVEN.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T11:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:16:33.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
