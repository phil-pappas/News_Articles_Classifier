Curriculum implemented in the Baker School District over the past three years — mainly Engage New York — was noticeably missing from the list. That is no surprise, said Betty Palmer, the district’s assistant superintendent. That’s because Engage New York is considered “open educational resource material.\" “The state is prohibited from considering open educational resource material, which is not a published textbook,” Palmer said. The district was not required to go through an adoption process to begin using Engage New York because it was considered a bridge that would help the district transition from the old curriculum, based on old standards, to a more rigorous curriculum needed to improve student performance on new state standards. The Engage New York material was selected by the district several years ago because of its flexibility and the ability to modify it as necessary, which the district saw as a good thing, Palmer said. Instead, Engage New York has generated unprecedented complaints from parents who say their children are having a difficult time adapting to the changes and that they are unable to help them. As the district moves forward, decisions will be made whether to select new materials from the approved list, look for something else and apply for the right to make an individual selection or file for a two-year extension, Palmer said. Within the new few weeks, parent math nights will be scheduled, and more are planned in the future. The first, for parents and students in Grades 7-9, is scheduled from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Wednesday at Baker High School, 2500 E St. Future sessions are planned for Nov. 10 at South Baker Intermediate School and Nov. 12 at Brooklyn Primary, with other sessions to be announced later. Teachers and administrators will continue reviewing materials, with the goal of making curriculum recommendations for the board’s adoption this spring, Palmer said. Parents also will be invited to participate in the process.
