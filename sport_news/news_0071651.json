Sounders defender Brad Evans flicked it off his head across the goal, and Barrett, who came on in the 85th minute, ran onto the ball and one-timed it into the net from 2 yards away for his fifth of the year. \nThe Sounders (14-13-5, 47 points) extended their unbeaten streak to six games (4-0-2). \nLos Angeles (14-9-9, 51 points) clinched a playoff spot and climbed into a Supporters Shield tie with the New York Red Bulls. New York has four games left, and the Galaxy have two. \nIn the 36th minute, Robbie Keane converted a Seattle defensive giveaway into a goal. Seattle's Zach Scott, playing on the defensive left side, sent the ball toward Gonzalo Pineda at the top of the box. But he left it short, and Pineda couldn't reach it. \nKeane did, running onto the errant pass, taking it to the top of the penalty spot, and firing into the back right center for his 17th of the year.
