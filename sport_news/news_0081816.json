Another look at Texas A&M's #AggieNights uniform for Halloween. #12thMan #teamadidas pic.twitter.com/7Nwst8XkKq\n— adidas Football US (@adidasFballUS) August 7, 2015\nTake a closer look at the #AggieNights helmet from @hydrographics1 #12thMan #teamadidas pic.twitter.com/bEutPXxqSc\n— Texas A&M Football (@AggieFootball) August 7, 2015 A special helmet that reflected the A&M logo inside of the state of Texas was among the uniform tricks that Adidas and A&M figured to be a delightful treat for the fans in attendance at Kyle Field on Halloween night.\nHere's the problem: The SEC Week 9 TV schedule has been released , and the highly marketed uniforms designed for a night game are now set to be worn for an 11 a.m. kickoff.\nEven if the game creeps toward the four-hour mark as it did last week against Alabama, it doesn't appear that the full effects of these uniforms will have a chance to be seen, at least not against the Gamecocks. A slow start to the season from South Carolina in addition to the recent departure of former head coach Steve Spurrier -- coupled with the Aggies recent 41-23 defeat at the hands of the Tide -- surely didn't help chances for a prime time slot.\nHere's the reaction from around Twitter:\n@TAMUequipment any way you guys could just save the black uniforms for LSU? Seems kinda silly for a day game.\n— Capt. America (@Robert_White14) October 19, 2015\nYou would think that there would be a person in the A&M/Adidas marketing room who said \"what if its not a night game?\" You would be wrong\n— Lucas Jackson (@CoolHand_Lucas) October 19, 2015\n#hype poster for the @AggieFootball vs USC matchup on Halloween. @GBHunting @ADornburg pic.twitter.com/696kSgEzfd\n— Chris Elam (@crchriselam) October 19, 2015\nMaybe there was a typo and it's actually an 11 pm game.\n— Jessica!
