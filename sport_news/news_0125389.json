Can the Eaglesâ€™ pass defense contain them? Yes. View results \n\"Any quarterback is familiar with his story,\" Bradford said. \"He's made a tremendous comeback. I'm not sure outside himself anyone believed he's able to do what he's done. It's been truly remarkable. It's something that I was aware of. But did I have a specific conversation with someone about it? Not really.\" \nBoth Bradford and Brees went to orthopedic surgeon James Andrews for their surgeries. Brees said Wednesday that Andrews saved his career, and he spoke about the challenge of recovering from an injury. He added that the \"right opportunity\" and the \"blessings of just being able to stay healthy\" would allow Bradford to be successful. That was the formula for Brees in New Orleans. \n\"Obviously there's risk all the time when you do that,\" Payton said, \"but there's conviction in knowing exactly what you're getting when healthy.\" \nThe Eagles are still trying to figure out what they have in Bradford, but the Saints know what they have in Brees. The 36-year-old averaged 4,854 yards and 35 touchdowns per season from 2006 to 2014 in Payton's offense. \nBrees has new faces surrounding him this season after the 2014 trade of Darren Sproles to the Eagles and the offseason trades of Jimmy Graham to the Seahawks and Kenny Stills to the Dolphins. That changed the personnel and where the passes are distributed, but it's the same quarterback, coach, and system that the Eagles play on Sunday. Brees has four touchdowns and two interceptions in thee games - he missed Week 3 with a shoulder injury - and his presence remains the biggest threat to the Eagles. \n\" I think the common theme for all the top five or 10 quarterbacks, however you want to rate them, is that they have the playbook at the line of scrimmage,\" defensive coordinator Bill Davis said. \"I think those are the hardest to defend. You show a blitz, they run a screen; you don't show a blitz look, you open the box up to where you split the safeties, and they make their best run play. . . .So I think facing the Drew Breeses of the world, [it's an] operation where it really is like having a coordinator at quarterback. They can adjust from what you show.\" \nKelly marveled at Brees' accuracy. He said there are times when he thinks a receiver is covered, but Brees knows the exact spot to place the pass. So if there's space on the back shoulder that is open, Brees will find it. \n\"You're dealing with a different type of quarterback than a lot of guys you see in the league,\" Kelly said. \"He's in that Aaron Rodgers category where you can say, 'Hey we have pretty good coverage on this play, but we don't because of where exactly he can place the football.' There aren't a lot of guys that can do that.\" \nBrees said that his shoulder is \"fine\" - he went 33 of 41 for 359 yards and two touchdowns on Sunday against Dallas - and that he told the coaches to take him off the injury report so he would not need to discuss the injury anymore. Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins, Brees' former Saints teammate, said he looked like \"normal Drew Brees.\" \nThe Saints are banking on that right shoulder remaining healthy, just as they did in 2006. The Eagles studied what the Saints did, and they are hoping they can reap similar benefits after gambling on Bradford's left knee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:54:43.810+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
