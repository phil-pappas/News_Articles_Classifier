Or was it the fact that the Raider Diaspora turned Qualcomm Stadium into O.Co Coliseum South, with at least an equal number of the fans and the vast majority of the noise during a 37-29 victory?\nMake no mistake. Regardless of the final score, padded as it was by three fourth-quarter Chargers touchdowns, this was a tail whipping of the first order.\nIf this is an indication of the future business partnership between these ancient rivals, Dean Spanos had better keep an eye on his wallet.\nThe Raiders have already stolen the Chargers’ souls. Might as well take their lunch money, too.\nOakland (3-3) scored on its first seven possessions, and if three trips to the red zone hadn’t resulted in field goals rather than touchdowns, the margin would have been worse.\nThe Raiders pretty much did whatever they wanted offensively. Derek Carr threw for an efficient 289 yards. Rookie receiver Amari Cooper shook loose for 133 yards on five catches, including a short pass toward the end of the second quarter that Cooper turned into a 52-yard touchdown, making Chargers defenders look like the Washington Generals.\nAnd Raiders’ backs punished the Chargers (2-5) to the tune of 5.0 yards a carry.\nMeanwhile, Philip Rivers – who threw for a club-record 503 yards a week ago in Green Bay – had to pad his stats in the second half to get to 336. San Diego’s seven first half possessions: Interception, punt, field goal, interception, punt, punt, field goal.\nThe day started badly: Rivers was intercepted on the third play of the game, with Malcolm Smith returning it to the San Diego 2-yard line to set up the Raiders first touchdown.\nOakland’s other pick, by D.J. Hayden, came on a pass Rivers threw behind Keenan Allen. Rivers was often off target while the game was in doubt, finishing 38 of 58 mainly by going 21 of 28 in the fourth quarter after the Chargers had fallen behind, 37-6.\n“There’s not much you can say after a game like this,” Chargers coach Mike McCoy said. “Nothing good happened from the first play on.”\nIf McCoy had little to say about his team’s uninspired, ineffective performance, he had nothing concrete to say about what could only have been a benching of first-round draft pick Melvin Gordon. He didn’t use the running back at all until the second series of the third quarter, opting for Branden Oliver.\nWas it a further way of reprimanding Gordon for his fumbling problems, perhaps?\n“We’re trying to win football games, not trying to punish people,” McCoy snapped. “We went with the game plan. We said from day one we were going to play (the running backs) by committee.”\nUsually that means rotating your backs a little more evenly. But why should we question a coach whose team has now lost eight of 11 games dating back to last season, including five of seven in the AFC West?\nYou’ve got to think Gordon was biting his tongue.\n“I hate watching,” he said. “It doesn’t sit well with me watching my teammates trying to go out there and make plays, and I’m on the sideline looking helpless when I know I can help change things out there.”\nAll of this played out before an even more Raider-dominated crowd than anticipated. Oakland players said they thought the crowd was evenly split, but most of the noise and emotion came from the people wearing black.\n“We knew going in that we were going to have a good following,” Raiders running back Latavius Murray said. “It helps, it really does, to have a bit of a home game on the road.”\nThe most brutal part of this from the Chargers’ standpoint? This was pretty much a must-win in order to climb back into the playoff race, and the Chargers played as if it were an inconvenient use of their Sunday.\n“Garbage,” Allen called it.\nAnd second-year cornerback Jason Verrett wondered where the desire was.\n“I just think when you don’t come out fired up, and you don’t bounce back against a team with that much energy, you get your (butt) kicked,” Verrett said. “That’s basically what happened. They came out fired up and we just allowed them to get over on us.”\nObviously, there will be some serious soul searching required at Chargers Park this week, from both players and coaches, before this season slips away.\nRemember our premise that the Chargers were entering the soft underbelly of their schedule? Turns out Sunday, they were the soft underbelly.\nContact the writer: jalexander@pe.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:11:54.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
