He will not be at next week’s Atlantic Coast Conference media day. By Seattle Times staff The Associated Press \nLouisville coach Rick Pitino has been adamant in the defense of his basketball program, taking opportunities to deny allegations by an escort that have led to calls for him to step down. \nOn Friday, he decided to take a different approach — passing on the chance to address the allegations on the national stage during next week’s Atlantic Coast Conference media day. \nA day after vowing to fans on his website he “will not resign and let you down” in the wake of allegations former Cardinals staffer Andre McGee hired Katina Powell and other dancers to strip and have sex with recruits and players, Pitino announced Friday through the school he was not going to attend ACC media day in Charlotte, N.C. His decision comes on the advice of counsel because of the allegations. \n“I realize that while many would like to question me on the allegations, the NCAA does not permit me to speak on the subject,” the 63-year-old Pitino said.
