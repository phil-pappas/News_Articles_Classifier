I’d be surprised if one of them don’t buy very shortly.”\nAsked what sort of timeframe was likely, Ecclestone replied: “This year.” Ecclestone did not name any of the interested parties.\nCVC Capital Partners are currently the controlling shareholders with a 35.5 percent stake, while Ecclestone holds 5.3 percent.\nU.S. investment groups BlackRock and Waddell & Reed, along with Norway’s Norges Bank, are among other shareholders.\nReports in June suggested that RSE Ventures, the investment vehicle of Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross, was teaming up with Qatar Sports Investments to buy CVC’s stake in a potential $7 billion-$8 billion deal.\nCVC’s co-chairman Donald Mackenzie told Reuters in July, however, that the rights holders were under no pressure to sell.\n“We like owning it (Formula One), we don’t want to sell it. There are always some people who’d like to buy it, it’s a very good business,” he said. CVC sold down its holding from 63 percent in 2012 in deals that at the time gave the business an enterprise value, which includes debt and equity, of $9.1 billion.\nEcclestone told Reuters separately in July that “lots of people have made approaches” and indicated he too might be interested in a takeover or buyout.\n“Donald Mackenzie doesn’t want to sell, simple as that,” he said then. “He loves Formula One, loves the business. He may have to sell his shares.\n“Whether he will invest himself, maybe with me separately, we will have to wait and see.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:54:05.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
