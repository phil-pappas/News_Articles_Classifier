Cousins completed 25 of his 43 pass attempts for 196 yards, with a touchdown and two interceptions. Those two interceptions put him up to eight total, an average of more than one a game. Neither were particularly good decisions and both were poorly thrown. \nCousins first interception came on one of the Redskins’ base concepts. \nOn second and eight with the scores tied, the Redskins use a double stick concept to the right, with a slant-flat concept to the left. This gives the quarterback an easy read; go to the right against zone coverage or left against man. \nCousins makes the correct read initially, looking to his right while the Jets play zone. Tight end Derek Carrier could have potentially been undercut on his route by the inside defender, but Jamison Crowder was open with a defender four yards off of him. Cousins opts against throwing to Crowder and works back to his left. \nThe slant-flat route combination is designed to create traffic for a defender in man coverage assigned to cover the flat. But with the Jets in zone, nobody gets caught in traffic. Instead, Darrelle Revis peels off the slant route from Pierre Garcon and works back outside. \nCousins never saw Revis peeling off Garcon and was intercepted. The ball from Cousins lacked velocity, which probably saved this from being taken all the way back. If the ball had enough velocity on it to reach Ryan Grant, then Revis might have been able to make the interception in stride. \nThis is as poor as any of the throws I’ve seen from Cousins all season. Everything went wrong. He passed up an open receiver, came back to the wrong read against zone coverage and then made a bad decision to throw. On top of that, the throw itself was poor and probably wouldn’t have reached Grant even if Revis wasn’t there to make the interception. \nA few drives later, Cousins threw his second interception. While it was another poor throw, it was easier to see the reasoning behind the decision to make the throw. \nOn third and 10, the Redskins use a bunch trips formation to the left. The two key routes are run by Garcon and Crowder. Garcon runs a post route while Crowder runs an out-and-up route. \nThe idea behind this route combination is to get the safety to bite inside on the post route, leaving Crowder one-on-one on the outside. As Cousins begins his throw, this is exactly what happens. Crowder breaks outside as part of his route, leaving the safety to shift his attention to Garcon on the post route. \nUnfortunately for Cousins, by the time the ball was in the air, the safety had noticed his mistake and began to work back to the outside. Had Cousins waited a fraction of a second longer, he might have seen that and worked underneath where wide receiver Andre Roberts was running open across the middle. \nThe biggest problem for Cousins was the type of throw he made. The safety made a great adjustment after initially biting inside, meaning Cousins would have needed to make an Aaron Rodgers-esque throw to fit the ball in a tight window to Crowder. But instead, Cousins lofts his throw, giving the safety even more time to readjust and get over the top of the route before attacking the ball in the air. Cousins put so much air under the throw that the corner on the outside had enough time to make up the yard that Crowder had gained on him. Even if the safety hadn’t been there, the corner might have made it back to make the interception or break up the pass. \nLast week we saw some poor mechanics from Cousins , leading to bad throws behind targets. But at least then, he was still making solid decisions. But against the Jets, Cousins was making poor decisions that held the offense back. It remains to be seen how much longer Cousins has as the starting quarterback, but after a performance like that, he won’t have a long leash. \nMark Bullock is The Insider’s Outsider , sharing his Redskins impressions without the benefit of access to the team.
