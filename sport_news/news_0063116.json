(AP) â€” Getting a ticket from police in one Massachusetts town isn't necessarily a bad thing.\nConcord's police department says it plans to issue up to 200 \"citations\" for good behavior. That could include such things as wearing a bicycle helmet or a seat belt, yielding to pedestrians at a crosswalk or looking both ways before crossing a street.\nPolice Chief Joseph O'Connor says it's a light-hearted way to connect positively with the community.\nInstead of a fine or a court appearance, these citations can be redeemed for two scoops of ice cream at Reasons to be Cheerful, a local dessert cafe. The owner of the restaurant, Wade Rubinstein, agreed to donate the ice cream.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:09:45.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
