Oakdale Irrigation District and South San Joaquin Irrigation District, which together hold senior water rights to the first 600,000 acre-feet stored in the 2.4 million acre-foot reservoir each year, announced the plan in a press release last week. The districts said it would benefit river conditions and fisheries, as well as the needs of agriculture and more than 200,000 residential customers downstream. “This agreement shows that, with cooperation and some give and take, the needs of fish and ag can be met,” OID General Manager Steve Knell stated in the press release. “If the drought continues, we’ll need more of this type of cooperation — not less.” New Melones contained 276,692 acre-feet of water as of Monday morning, according to the state Department of Water Resources, about 12 percent of its total capacity and 21 percent of its average historical capacity for this time of year. The total “pulse flow” set to begin today — 23,000 acre-feet — is enough to fill about 23,000 football fields one-foot deep in water. It’s also about 6,000 acre-feet more than Tuolumne Utilities District, the county’s largest water purveyor, uses on average each year to serve roughly 44,000 residents. Earlier this year, the irrigation districts sparred with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation — which manages New Melones Reservoir — over spring pulse flows that they feared would leave as little as 147,000 acre-feet in the reservoir by the end of September. However, “aggressive conservation efforts” by OID and SSJID as well as “better-than-expected spring and summer runoff” helped to create the surplus, the press release stated. The districts agreed to use the unanticipated savings to help the Bureau of Reclamation send the required pulse flow down the river to attract adult salmon returning from the ocean to spawn. According to the press release, “west side” water users will divert the released water farther downstream after it passes through the Stanislaus and lower San Joaquin rivers and have agreed to compensate the districts. Federal policies requiring such pulse flows have drawn the ire of local residents and elected leaders, who have argued that releasing so much water during a drought doesn’t make sense. Congressman Tom McClintock, R-Roseville, introduced legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives earlier this year called the Save Our Water Act that would suspend pulse flows in areas affected by drought. Though no action has been taken since the bill was introduced in March, McClintock says he’s hopeful the House will vote on it sometime before the end of the year.
