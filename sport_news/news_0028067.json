BOYS SOCCER: Oliver Ames takes down Attleboro Comment By Greg Dudek   9:43 pm Updated at 11:46 PM EASTON – All it took was a matter of seconds for the Oliver Ames High boys soccer team to take a stranglehold on Attleboro. After numerous opportunities to score against the Blue Bombardiers in the first 15 minutes of play, the Tigers broke through with senior midfielder Keegan Nutt netting two goals in a span of 16 seconds to lift Oliver Ames to a 3-1 win Tuesday at Valentine P. Muscato Stadium. “One thing we’re doing is we’re finding opportunities to score goals and hopefully we’ll just score more of them,” said Oliver Ames head coach John Barata, whose Tigers stayed unbeaten and are now 10-0. “But I think the complexion changed and it was very positive for us to score two goals very, very quickly.” Oliver Ames put the pressure on Attleboro (3-8-1) early and often. Senior forward Chris Romero had the Tigers’ first great scoring chance two minutes in, getting behind the defense for a breakaway, but his shot went just wide. Nutt was turned away twice in the early going as well, once by the keeper and once by the post to keep things level. But in the 17th minute, everything changed, as junior Thomas McCormick crossed the ball to Nutt in the box, who settled it nicely and then blasted a shot past the keeper for a 1-0 lead. After the reset, the Tigers stayed on the attack. They turned the Blue Bombardiers over in their zone and Nutt struck one from 20 yards out that found the back of the net for a 2-0 advantage. “Keegan’s great,” Barata said. “He’s a good player. He’s one of our go-to guys. He’s one of the top three or four (players in the Hockomock) this year, if not the top. His promise is great. He scored goals. He did what he had to do.” The two goals were more than enough for the Hockomock League’s best defense. Attleboro’s offense never got into any rhythm in the second half as senior defenders Jared Mallers, Max Ahearn and Max Bamford took away several opportunities with strong play on the back end in front of sophomore goalkeeper Jack Carroll (four saves). With back-and-forth play over the final 40 minutes, Oliver Ames got back on the board and added to its lead near the end of the second half. Sophomore midfielder Nathaniel Cardoza put home a rebound with 6:27 left in regulation to give the Tigers an insurmountable advantage, 3-0. “The challenge was we didn’t put them away,” Barata said. “We kept them around and it became more of a game. Then we finally got the third goal and we broke them down.” A late push by Attleboro resulted in a goal by junior Harry Lancaster, who knocked one in during a scrum in front of the net. It was only the second goal Oliver Ames has allowed all season and its first in six games. “It’s OK. I don’t mind giving up a goal,” Barata said. “Get the monkey off your back. Now, no one has to talk about it. We’ve given up two goals. It’s over.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T11:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:22:17.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
