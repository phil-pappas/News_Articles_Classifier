But a good look.\nThe right side of the 66-year-old Albuquerque family physician’s face bears the scar from a deep knife wound. She can’t swallow and has to suction her own saliva so she doesn’t choke. She gets nutrition through a stomach tube. She can’t lift her left arm or use her right hand.\nAnd she has accepted that she will no longer practice medicine because her own health now has to be her priority. She will likely spend the rest of her life trying to recover from what her son, a mentally ill and substance-abusing young man, did to her. She will not do it in her lifelong home; she can’t afford to live there now that she can’t work and she is a widow.\nBecause when her son, James, 24, tried to stab her to death, he did kill his father, David.\nSo look at Kathy Finch, senators and representatives. Look long. Look hard. This is the face of what mental illness can do to someone who has lived with and loved a disturbed person like only a parent can.\nAnd before you look away, try to explain why New Mexico does not need such a law. Why an evaluation, perhaps detention for a psychiatric exam, even outpatient care is unacceptable “forced treatment.” Forty-five other states already have laws authorizing assisted outpatient treatment.\nAsk Kathy Finch about the myriad treatments to save her life after she almost bled to death on her floor as her adult son sat naked and crying on her back porch – covered in his parents’ blood. Ask her about the restraining order, the bars on the doors, the home alarm – all put in place to try to protect them from their only child.\nAsk her about her son’s individual civil rights to not be treated now that he is locked up, denied bail.\nIt would be good for you to hear what she has to say. Because while advocates claim an assisted outpatient treatment law will hurt some of the state’s most vulnerable residents, Kathy Finch knows better. She has lived without one the 24 years of her troubled son’s life and bears the emotional, mental and now physical scars.\nAnd she isn’t giving up or giving in – though nobody could blame her if she did. She wants New Mexico to finally protect the mentally ill and those who love them with legislation that would allow family members or authorities to force those with a history of behavioral problems to have quick mental health evaluations or treatment or drug detox.\nIt’s the bill like the one by Sen. Mary Kay Papen, D-Las Cruces, that you killed last session. And it’s an important piece of the behavioral health treatment puzzle for which Bernalillo County voters already approved a dedicated $20 million annual funding stream.\nSo listen to Kathy Finch. Look at what living with someone with untreated mental illness has done to her. And recognize there are too many New Mexicans living in similar situations, living in fear of becoming the next Kathy or David Finch.\nThis editorial first appeared in the Albuquerque Journal.
