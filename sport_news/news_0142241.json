Bui was injured during the fourth quarter on Friday. He was taken to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle where he underwent surgery and had been in critical condition over the weekend. \nRogers says students and others at Evergreen High School are grieving and the school district is working to support them. District superintendent Susan Enfield says it's a devastating loss for everyone. \nBui's death follows the death of another high school player, 17-year-old Evan Murray, in New Jersey last month. Murray collapsed after taking a hit and later died from massive internal bleeding caused by a lacerated spleen. \nThis story has been updated to correct the name of the player to Kenney. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:52:14.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
