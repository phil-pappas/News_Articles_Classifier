He got possession of it after he came home from a stint in the U.S. Coast Guard, and began restoring it in the 1990s, doing most of the work himself.\n\"I've had a lot of fun with this car over the years,\" he said. \"From when we were kids cruising on E Street to now. It's always been a San Bernardino car.\"\nThe original Route 66 Rendezvous has always been a San Bernardino event, despite many obstacles and some changes to the venue. Founded in 1990 by the San Bernardino Convention & Visitors Bureau and now rechristened and run by the San Bernardino Area Chamber of Commerce, the Rendezvous boasts a 25-year history of celebrating the internal combustion engine.\nOpen to car models from 1900 to 1974, it draws classics, muscle cars, hot rods and trucks. Once a four-day, three-night extravaganza that covered 35 blocks, the Rendezvous has scaled down in recent years, and even moved out of downtown to San Manuel Stadium.\n\"It's good to have it back downtown,\" Gary DeVince said.\nLeo Rivas of Colton, like the DeVinces a member of the E Street Cruizers car club, said the Route 66 Rendezvous inspired him to start restoring cars, including the candy-apple red 1948 Chevrolet pickup he was showing off Saturday.\n\"It's a lot of work,\" he said. \"But I'm living the dream.\"\nContact the writer: Laurie.editor@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:29:03.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
