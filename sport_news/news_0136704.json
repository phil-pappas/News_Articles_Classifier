The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because no comments were authorized. \nFisher, speaking before the Knicks' exhibition game, wouldn't comment about his personal life but says he is \"completely focused and committed to the team.\" \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:23:01.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
