(Photo: Doug Pensinger, Getty Images) \nThe Detroit News breaks down Sunday's Vikings-Lions game at Ford Field (1 p.m., FOX/97.1).\nVikings to watch \nAdrian Peterson, RB: He’s back with a vengeance. Peterson had 134 yards and 29 carries, both season highs, last month at home against Lions. He is averaging 86.4 yards, fourth in NFL.\nTeddy Bridgewater, QB: In his second season, he is still a work in progress. The Vikings passing attack ranks last in the NFL. Against the Lions in Week 2, however, Bridgewater completed 14 of a season-low 18 attempts, threw for a TD, ran for another and had second-highest career rating.\nStefon Diggs, WR: Want a fantasy sleeper? The fifth-round pick from Maryland has 13 receptions and 216 yards receiving the last two games.\nIntangibles \nFantasy numbers: Matthew Stafford, coming off eighth game with four-plus TDs, might have his groove back after getting benched. He has 16 TDs, five INTs and is averaging 257 yards in 11 starts against the Vikings. The one-dimensional Lions need Stafford to throw a lot..\nThe old Calvin: Lions WR Calvin Johnson had 166 yards receiving, doubling his previous season high, and has an NFL-record 87.1-yard average among players with at least 100 games.\nThe old Tulloch: Lions LB Stephen Tulloch made team-high 13 tackles last week, nearly 11 months after tearing left ACL celebrating on field.\nTop defense: Mike Zimmer was considered one of the top defensive coordinators before becoming the Vikings coach. He loves to blitz.\nOpposites: The Vikings have one of the league’s best rushing attacks, ranking sixth; the Lions have by far the league’s worst. The Lions have the fifth-ranked passing attack. The Vikings defense ranks 13th, while the struggling Lions rank 27th.\nFacts and figures \n*The Vikings have dominated this series, winning 24 of 32 since 2000.\n*Vikings second-year coach Mike Zimmer is 0-3 on road against the NFC North.\n*Vikings S Harrison Smith is the only NFL player since 2012 with at least 11 INTs and four sacks.\n*Lions WR Lance Moore has 11 receptions, 161 yards receiving and two TDs in two games.\n*Theo Riddick has 33 receptions, most by Lions running back through six games since James Jones had 34 in 1984.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:15:47.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
