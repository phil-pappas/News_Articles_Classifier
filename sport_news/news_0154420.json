Posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 6:00 am Oklahoma State's Ogbah, Sinor earn conference honor Oklahoma State stwnewspress.com \nEmmanuel Ogbah and Zach Sinor both secured conference honors in the wake of Oklahoma State’s overtime win at West Virginia, with Ogbah recognized as Big 12 co-defensive player of the week and Sinor tabbed as Big 12 special teams player of the week, the conference office announced today. \nFor Ogbah, it marked the second time this season and the third time in his career that he has been honored as Big 12 player of the week. It was the first such accolade for Sinor. \nOgbah was everywhere in the Cowboys’ win in Morgantown. The All-America candidate scored a defensive touchdown, forced two fumbles, recovered a fumble and notched a sack, a tackle for loss and a quarterback hurry. He also set a season high with eight tackles. \nThe reigning Big 12 Defensive Lineman of the Year loomed larger than any other player in the game and the Cowboys needed every bit of production that he gave them. His fumble recovery in the end zone opened the scoring and the first fumble that he forced enabled the Cowboy offense to start a drive at the West Virginia 28 yard line. Just five plays later, the Pokes found the end zone. \nIn conference games, Ogbah leads the Big 12 in sacks, tackles for loss and fumbles forced and he ranks among the national leaders in all three categories. \nAs for Sinor, on a night when yards and good field position were hard to come by, the freshman from Castroville, Texas had a huge impact on the Cowboys’ victory. Sinor punted eight times for an average of 44.9 yards, with three of his punts downed inside the Mountaineer 20 yard line. \nMore important is that he did his best work in the fourth quarter, hampering the WVU cause with punts of 49 yards, 52 yards and 50 yards on his last three strikes. \nFor the game, Sinor’s eight punts resulted in just three punt return yards for West Virginia. \nThe 6-0 Cowboys (3-0 in the Big 12) are off this week before hosting Kansas on Oct. 24. \nBig 12 Player Of The Week Honors For Oklahoma State in 2015 \nEmmanuel Ogbah Defense Sept. 28 \nBen Grogan Special Teams Sept. 28 \nMason Rudolph Offense Oct. 5 \nEmmanuel Ogbah Defense Oct. 12 \nZach Sinor Special Teams Oct. 12 \nWith your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:24:47.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
