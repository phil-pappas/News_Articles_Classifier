Print this article Advertisement ATHENA — With state playoff implications and second place in the Columbia Basin Conference on the line, Weston-McEwen unleashed a homecoming ground attack here Friday in CBC football action. With Ethan Reger rushing for 162 yards and Vince Roff adding 143 leading the way, the TigerScots combined for 378 rushing yards and defeated Irrigon 37-12. The TigerScots struck quickly as Roff galloped 65 yards to pay dirt on W-M’s opening carry. Reger ran in the two-point conversion and the TigerScots took an 8-0 lead. Brett Speed opened the second period with a 14-yard touchdown pass to Xander Bailey and W-M stretched the lead to 14-0. Austin Rice scored on a 26-yard run to draw Irrigon within 14-6 at the half. Irrigon started the second half with the ball and Rice scored his second touchdown on a two-yard run as Irrigon cut the TigerScot lead to 14-12. The TigerScot defense took over. Irrigon could only manage two first downs the rest of the way and the TigerScot “D” shut out Irrigon the rest of the night. “Tremendous game for our defense,” W-M coach T.J. Bailey said. “Irrigon averaged 40 points a game and 450 yards rushing coming in and we held them to 12 points and 128 yards on the ground. The defensive effort says a lot for our kids and our coaching staff. We challenged them (the kids) to understand their responsibilities. The kids knew what to do.” Before the third period closed, Tyler Cain ran 17 yards for a score and Kirk Scott booted home the PAT. W-M had breathing room at 21-12 heading to the fourth. Roff added two short TD runs in the fourth and the defense not only blanked Irrigon, but scored the last points of the night on a safety to secure the 37-12 TigerScot win. “It was a great total program win and moves us into a great position to move on into the state playoffs,” coach Bailey concluded. “Culver at Culver (Friday) will be another test for us.” The win moves W-M to 2-1 in the CBC and into a tie with Stanfield for second place.
