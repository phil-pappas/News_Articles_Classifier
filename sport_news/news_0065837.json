All of the game's scoring came in the first half as Brooks rushed for two touchdowns and Vieira threw for two more – both to Nick Salmon – as the Hilltoppers improved to 2-5. Nauset remains winless at 0-7. \"We needed to get back on track,\" said Durfee coach Taylor Brown. \"I told them this was a new season and we're starting today 0-0.\" Durfee wasted no time getting on the board as Vieira connected with Salmon on a 37-yard scoring pass on the fourth play of the game. Vieira booted the PAT and Durfee quickly led 7-0. Nauset, coached by former Green Bay Packers head coach Mike Sherman, was unable to move the ball even after recovering a muffed punt on Durfee's 35-yard line after going three-and-out on its first series. With 3;40 left in the quarter, Durfee regained possession and scored with 1:03 remaining when Brooks broke free for a 54-yard touchdown to help give the Toppers a 14-0 lead. Brooks has rushed for 100-plus yards in all of Durfee's games this season. Brooks made it 21-0 on Durfee's first possession of the second quarter, breaking loose for a 29-yard score. Durfee struck again after Sakai Howard picked off a Travis Van Vleck pass to set up a 22-yard, Vieira-to-Salmon scoring strike with 3:23 left in the half. Nauset got on the board after Akeem Atkinson gave the Warriors great field possession, returning the ensuing kickoff to the Durfee 34-yard line. A 13-yard Van Vleck run brought the ball to the Durfee 16, and two plays later Van Vleck tossed a 14-yard touchdown pass to Sam McGough. James Tooker's extra point kick made it 28-7 with 59 seconds left. Durfee quick brought the ball into Warrior territory, highlighted by a 29-yard Vieira run and a 26-yard pass to Salmon, and with six seconds left, Vieira booted a 37-yard field goal to make it 31-7. \"Coming out here and getting a win is big for us,\" Brown said. \"Our goal is to be .500 going into Thanksgiving. Overall, it was a great team win for us.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:49:07.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
