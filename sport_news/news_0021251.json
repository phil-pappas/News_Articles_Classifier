Dodgers hitters looked thoroughly overmatched at times.\nThey face deGrom again tonight in Game 5 with the season on the line and Dodgers manager Don Mattingly is hopeful seeing deGrom again so soon after that game will help.\n\"Well, if he's on and he's throwing the ball where he wants and making pitches, it's going to be a difficult day,\" Mattingly said. \"Obviously, the same for Zack (Greinke). If he's able to do that, it could be a difficult day the other way.\n\"I think personally the more I see a hitter, the more advantage I have. Now, stuff is still stuff. You have to be able to hit it - a 99-mph fastball. So I think, as a hitter, I always felt like as a hitter I have a better feel for him. I've seen it. I've rated the speed. I kind of got a feel for what this guy likes to do.\"\nThe Dodgers also point to the four-day layoff between the end of the season and Game 1 of this series as a less-than-ideal way to prepare for a power pitcher such as deGrom. The Dodgers have seen a steady diet of hard-throwers from the Mets in the past four games now.\n\"I heard some people make mention of that small layoff between the end of the season and Game 1 - it's hard to gear back up for that velocity,\" Dodgers catcher A.J. Ellis said. \"But playing in these games and seeing velocity after velocity after velocity, I do expect us to be maybe a little bit more on time facing somebody like deGrom - which may or may not even matter the way he throws the baseball.\"\nGame 5 lineups:\nMETS (2-2) \nRF Curtis Granderson\n3B David Wright\n2B Daniel Murphy\nCF Yeonis Cespedes\n1B Lucas Duda\nC Travis d'Arnaud\nLF Michael Conforto\nSS Wilmer Flores\nRHP Jacob deGrom\nDODGERS (2-2) \n2B Howie Kendrick\nSS Corey Seager\n1B Adrian Gonzalez\n3B Justin Turner\nRF Andre Ethier\nC Yasmani Grandal\nLF Kike' Hernandez\nCF Joc Pederson\nRHP Zack Greinke", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:45:11.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
