(Photo: Daniel Mears / Detroit News) \n5 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 5 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Allen Park – — Despite an 0-3 start and having games against two of the NFL’s best teams up next, desperation is not a word the Lions are using frequently this week.\nThe Lions haven’t started calling players-only meetings. The doom-and-gloom from fans has barely entered the team facility. From the perspective of players and coaches, there are 13 games left to overcome the early deficit.\n“This is one of those games that can be a turning point in our season,” strong safety James Ihedigbo said of Monday night’s game in Seattle. “And you get a win like this, in a place like that, it could really boost our team in the right direction as we continue to go after this thing.”\nBeating the Seahawks will be no easy feat, especially since they’re strong in places that could expose the weaknesses on display for the Lions so far. Seattle ranks third in total defense and second against the pass with a combination of elite pass rushers and defensive backs. The Seahawks can also run well — ranking fifth — and have a good tight end in Jimmy Graham, a position to which the Lions have already allowed three touchdowns.\nIn April, Lions free safety Glover Quin predicted a 7-1 start for his team, making the projection with the thought each team would play at its best.\n“Clearly in the first three games, we probably didn’t play the best football that we could play,” he said. “So, in that situation, we didn’t get wins.”\nThe only loss Quin projected was the upcoming game in Seattle, so maybe his trend of incorrect predictions will continue as the Lions try to get on track at CenturyLink Field, where the Seahawks have lost just two games since 2012.\n“It’s not dire,” Quin said. “There’s a lot of football left. We’ve just got to get a win. Everything we want is right in front of us.”\nAnd that’s the message coach Jim Caldwell has relayed to players all week. On Thursday, he said the Lions are close to winning and that there’s a fine line between winning and losing.\n“I think our team is right there,” he said. “You just can’t see it, but we can.”\nHere’s what people have seen from the Lions so far in 2015:\n■ A team that ranks 27th in total offense.\n■ A team tied for 27th in total defense.\n■ An offense ranked 32nd in rushing.\n■ An offense tied for 30th with eight turnovers.\n■ A team tied for 23rd in points scored and 25th in points allowed.\nAccording to the players, though, the stats don’t matter.\n“We’re in the business of winning football games,” Ihedigbo said. “You’re judged on your wins and losses in this league, nothing else really matters — no other stat.”\nSome players downplayed the idea of being a desperate team, again pointing to the need to play their best in order to end the losing streak. Even if desperation could help the Lions, it wouldn’t play much role Monday as the Seahawks have started 1-2.\n“People always play us hard and tough and we expect that,” Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said in a teleconference this week. “It’s about how we perform and get it done, so we’re hopefully going to take care of business.”\nCarroll said the Lions are a team “loaded with talent” and many of the players feel similarly. In order to beat the Seahawks, who have represented the NFC in the last two Super Bowls, Ihedigbo said the Lions simply have to “play our best football” instead of trying to do anything heroic.\n“If we do what we need to do, execute like we need to execute, we can turn this out to be a great season,” wide receiver Calvin Johnson said.\nAs Caldwell said after last Sunday’s loss to the Broncos, there are 13 games remaining and the NFL has yet to start awarding trophies.\nThere is still time to turn the season around, but after an offseason filled with high expectations after an 11-5 finish in 2014, this start has not met the standards for coaches or players.\n“I would say disappointment from just current state of events, but still confident,” Ihedigbo said of the mood in the locker room. “We’re disappointed, but we’re not discouraged and that’s kind of our mindset.\n“We understand that we just have to continue to work at it for it to get better. And that’s what we’re going to do.”\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:20:16.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
