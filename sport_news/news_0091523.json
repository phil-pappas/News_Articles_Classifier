I would be very upset if anyone asked me to give them a guarantee of a place.\"\nLiverpool striker Danny Ings has also been called up for the qualifiers against Estonia and Lithuania (Oct. 12), along with Rooney, Harry Kane, Theo Walcott and Jamie Vardy.\nDaniel Sturridge misses out after recently returning from long-term injury.\n\"If you put Danny Welbeck into that list as well, who has done ever so well for us, I think our choice is enormously different to 2012, put it that way,\" Hodgson said.\n\"If I cast my mind back, there seems to be so many more players now knocking on the door than there were four years ago, so that's got to be very positive.\"\nHodgson also invited Aston Villa's Jack Grealish to train with the team after the 20-year-old decided to play for England rather than Republic of Ireland.\nHowever, Villa manager Tim Sherwood refused to let Grealish go with the 20-year-old still waiting for FIFA to ratify the nationality decision.\n\"The idea was to show him St George's Park and ... induct him into England ... but Tim made it clear that wasn't a good idea as far as he was concerned and he needed the boy to do some more training because he missed pre-season.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-02T20:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:33:59.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
