Now it has two in this Cup. \n\"When we came here we had two ambitions: To reach the quarterfinals and to be the team of the tournament,\" Jones said. \"If we win three games then I think we'll be the team of the tournament.\" \nFollowing the stunning 34-32 win against South Africa on the opening weekend, Japan is eyeing a first quarterfinal berth. It needs other results to go its way, then the Brave Blossoms will know where they stand going into the very last game of the pool stage next Sunday against the United States in Gloucester. \n\"If we're good enough we'll go through. We can't control the other stuff,\" Jones said. \nWith fullback Ayumu Goromaru kicking clinically, and sweeping in defense, Japan absorbed Samoa's best shots and was unlucky not to win by more. \n\"We haven't played our best yet,\" Jones said. \"We probably left two tries out there today, and that was the disappointing thing, but we've got the USA next so hopefully we will then.\" \nThe only sour note was an apparent head injury to right winger Akihito Yamada, the scorer of Japan's second try. He went off early in the second half after taking a knee to the head when making a wraparound tackle on center Paul Perez. He lay motionless for several minutes, and taken away on a stretcher. \n\"He looks allright, mate. He might be in line for an academy award,\" Jones said with his typically dry humor. \"No, he got knocked out, it looks like he's OK now. We'll do the appropriate protocol, and it looks like he should be fine for our next game.\" \nIt took Samoa 63 minutes to score. Following a turnover inside Samoa's 22, a fine sweeping move was finished emphatically by Perez in the left corner. \nA Stadium MK rugby-record crowd of 29,000 could hardly believe their eyes as Japan reached halftime 20-0 up. \n\"We've certainly picked up a lot of neutral fans,\" Jones said. \"This is a fantastic stadium to play rugby in.\" \nManu Samoa contributed to their downfall. No. 8 Faifili Levave was penalized for a late shoulder charge in the 16th minute, and referee Craig Joubert sent prop Sakaria Taulafo to the sin-bin in the 19th after Samoa conceded two defensive penalties in two minutes. \nSamoa defended brilliantly with 13 men, holding up Japan six times, but the penalty try was almost inevitable. Goromau added two penalties as he bounced back from a poor kicking performance in a 45-10 loss to Scotland last week. \nRight on the first-half hooter, Yamada dived into the right corner, and Goromaru nailed a difficult conversion from wide right. \nGoromaru's first penalty after the break punished Manu Samoa's 11th penalty conceded in the match. They would concede 17 by the end. Goromaru's fourth and last penalty extended his tournament-leading points tally to 45. \nTheir ferociously committed defense restricted Samoa to just the Perez try, the first time in 15 matches with Japan that Samoa has scored less than 10. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T23:09:29.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
