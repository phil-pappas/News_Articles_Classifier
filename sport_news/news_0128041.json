He was a starting linebacker and a frequent running back for the Bruins during his first two seasons. \nMora says Jack and his family had already decided Jack should drop out of school to prepare for the NFL before speaking to Mora. The veteran NFL coach says the move is \"very risky.\" \nJack played two full seasons at UCLA. He was the Pac-12's freshman of the year on offense and defense in 2013. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:36:05.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
