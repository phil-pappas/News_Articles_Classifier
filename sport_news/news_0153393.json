I felt like I earned it,\" Davis said. \"But then again, I was happy about it. I gave Coach Flood a lot of love. I'm working for him. That's what it's for — for my teammates and for coach.\"\nImmediately after the meeting with Flood, Davis called his father and then his mother.\n\"I mean, my dad probably called my mom right away once I talked to him,\" Davis said. \"He was happy and he congratulated me. We went out to dinner and had a good time.\"\nA Union native, Davis attended Avon Old Farms, a boarding school in Connecticut. After high school, Davis had scholarship offers from Patriot League schools and interest from Purdue and South Carolina as a possible walk-on. But Davis was set on walking on at Rutgers.\n\"Rutgers is my home,\" Davis said. \"I always wanted to stay home. I've always been a Rutgers fan. I always came to the camps when I was younger and Coach Flood is a great guy. When I met him, he was a good guy. He's a down-to-earth guy. He'll take care of you. As a walk-on, the coaches sometimes might not treat you as well as other players, but the coaches at Rutgers treated me as if I was part of the family. I was like, 'You know what, I'm going to give this place a shot.' And I enjoyed the visit and everything. It was great.\"\nPLUS: Breaking down Rutgers' scholarship count\nDavis redshirted in 2013, but showed enough to earn a scholarship before the start of the 2014 season. He earned a role on special teams, appearing in 10 games on the kickoff teams last season.\n\"That's where you have to start,\" Davis said. \"It's a want-to team. Some guys don't want to play special teams. But special teams are the key. You win games with special teams. So if you play special teams, you'll be able to get on offense and defense. But they want to see that work ethic. If you're not going to work, you're not even going to play.\"\nDavis switched from linebacker to rush defensive end this offseason. The 6-foot-2, 250-pounder has been part of the defensive line rotation this season, appearing in all four games and recording seven tackles, including a tackle for a loss.\n\"I love it,\" Davis said of his new position. \"It's kind of the same as linebacker. It's a little bit different with linemen using your hands, but I like it. It's the same to me. You stand up, you get in coverage — you're kind of a hybrid. You're like a D-lineman and a linebacker. I enjoy it. I might like it better, to tell you the truth. I like hitting the linemen and everything.\"\nDavis is one of many former walk-ons who have carved out a role at Rutgers. He hopes the attitude that enabled him to earn a scholarship will propel him to bigger things down the road.\n\"It was like all the hard work actually was for something. It wasn't just for nothing,\" Davis said. \"I feel like I earned it. I was real proud about it and my family was proud. I just have to keep working. Once you get the scholarship, some people are like, 'OK, you've got to stop working as hard.' But you just have to keep working.\"\nDan Duggan may be reached at dduggan@njadvancemedia.com .
