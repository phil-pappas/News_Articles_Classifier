(Photo by John Kelley) UGA women's basketball entering 'a new era we're all embarking on' By Chris Starrs sports@onlineathens.com – published Wednesday, October 21, 2015 \nSince being named head coach of Georgia’s women’s basketball team in the early spring, Joni Taylor’s thoughts had not strayed from the job at hand — until one important day. \nA few months after her appointment to succeed the iconic Andy Landers as the leader of the Lady Bulldogs, Taylor (nee Crenshaw) married former South Carolina assistant coach Darius Taylor. As she walked down the aisle on August 1, Taylor wasn’t thinking hoops. \n“There was no place in my brain that day for basketball,” Taylor said. “Now, the day before the wedding, I did some basketball work because I knew after the wedding we were going to go on a honeymoon for a while and I was going to be completely checked out. But up until that day, I was completely thinking basketball and basketball things.” \nWith the 2015-16 set to begin November 15 against Stetson at Stegeman Coliseum, basketball has Taylor’s full attention with a considerable hill to climb after the Lady Bulldogs’ disappointing 2014-15 season, the first year in the last two decades Georgia didn’t make the NCAA tournament. \nThe Mississippi native, who played at Alabama and has been an assistant coach for 13 seasons (the last three at Georgia) says that on the court, there’s not much of a difference between being an assistant and being the person in charge. It’s off the hardwood, however, where she’s experiencing the most change. \n“Coach Landers was wonderful to me, and during summers in the past he allowed me to run the team and run practices, so I’m very familiar coaching practice and making a practice plan and even making game-time decisions,” Taylor said. “The biggest difference has been non-basketball-related things. There are so many different hats you have to wear and it pulls you away from your team and pulls you away from basketball and from recruiting. \n“That’s where having a staff that’s experienced and on fire for you and what you believe in this program — that helps because they’re the ones who are there every day and can touch the girls and are in the trenches to make sure that why you’re away doing other things, you know that nothing slips through the cracks.” \nAnd in a way, Taylor’s got some unofficial assistants on the floor in seniors Shacobia Barbee (11.6 ppg, 6.9 rpg last season), Tiaria Griffin (11.3, 3.8), Merritt Hempe (7.3, 4.6) and Marjorie Butler (4.6, 2.3), who between them have started 223 games at Georgia. And while Mackenzie Engram (7.7, 4.5) is just a sophomore with seven career starts, she’s also shouldering the yoke of leadership. \n“It’s extremely comforting,” Taylor said. “I’ve spent the last month on the road recruiting, and to know I can pick up the phone and get a check-in from one of those seniors or even Mackenzie to see how the team is practicing or how they’re running and to know they’re going to hold those younger players accountable.” \n“Joni brings such a positive energy,” senior post player Merritt Hempe said of Taylor. “Something we’re learning is to constantly cheer for each other in practice and (we’re) learning how to pick everyone up, and we had a little bit of that last year. But definitely a struggle for us was just communication. That’s risen greatly for us — learning how to communicate better.” \nAccountability will be a watch-word for the Lady Bulldogs as it’s clear no one wants to experience a repeat of last season, when Georgia posted a 19-12 record with a disappointing 6-10 Southeastern Conference mark that included an eight-game league losing streak. \n“Whether they say it or not, they’re embarrassed about what happened last year; there’s a bit of a sting for them and they don’t want that to happen again,” Taylor said of her seniors. “They hold each other accountable and they shoulder the responsibility, too. \n“This is a new era for them, as well, and when you see them, their approach is a little bit different because, No. 1, they have a sense of urgency — they’re seniors and this is their last year. This is a new era we’re all embarking on.” \nOnlineAthens.com aims to foster constructive, respectful civic conversation.
