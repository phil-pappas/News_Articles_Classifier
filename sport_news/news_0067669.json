Police said Blake, who had ranked as high as No. 4 in the world before retiring after the 2013 U.S. Open, had been mistakenly identified as being part of a cellphone fraud scheme. Frascatore had mistaken Blake for a suspect who looked like him, police said.\nBOXING Wladimir Klitschko is on schedule in his recovery from an injured left calf, and the heavyweight champion says he will be ready to defend his title belts against Tyson Fury next month.\nKlitschko will begin training in less than two weeks at his usual camp in the Austrian Alps, the champ said while taking a brief break from rehabilitation in California.\nThe fight was delayed five weeks after Klitschko was injured in training last month. The bout was rescheduled for Nov. 28 at Esprit Arena in Düsseldorf, Germany, where a capacity crowd of 55,000 is still expected despite the date change.\nKlitschko (64-3, 53 KOs) had never hurt his calf before, but he knew rest and recovery would be preferable to fighting while injured, as Manny Pacquiao did against Floyd Mayweather Jr. in May.\nNHL San Jose Sharks forward Raffi Torres will not appeal his 41-game suspension for an illegal check to the head of Anaheim's Jakob Silfverberg in a preseason game.\nThe NHLPA said that Torres will not contest the longest suspension in NHL history for a hit on another player.\nThis marks the fifth and most significant suspension for Torres in his career. His previous longest ban had been a 21-game suspension — initially 25 games — for a high hit on Chicago's Marian Hossa in the first round of the playoffs in 2012 when he played for Arizona.\nCOLLEGE BASKETBALL The NCAA has talked with Ohio State freshman JaQuan Lyle , whose recruitment by Louisville is mentioned in a book by an escort alleging that strippers danced and had sex with Cardinals players and prospects.\nOSU spokesman Dan Wallenberg confirmed via email that Lyle met Tuesday with the NCAA, as first reported Wednesday by Yahoo Sports. The email did not mention Louisville, but noted there were no issues at Ohio State.\nFrom Journal Sentinel wire reports\n© ", "external_links": ["http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/JSI/RWS/jsonline.com/CAI/331182271/E/prod/PC/Basic/AT/A"], "published": "2015-10-08T11:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:08:23.783+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
