I’m getting ahold of my game,’’ he told reporters in Russia.\n“I’ve definitely been putting in the work this year. It hasn’t turned out for me as far as a health standpoint.\n“There’s many road bumps, and it’s about the way you deal with things.’’\nCilic was a late withdrawal from last summer’s Brisbane International due to a shoulder injury which eventually kept him off the ATP tour until April.\n“I’m fresh at the end of this season and it will help me in the new season,’’ Cilic said in a statement to Tennis Australia.\nMarin Cilic is Brisbane-bound.

It’s always a packed house and that’s great for the players.’’\nCilic made a good fist last month of defending his surprise US Open title, but ran aground in a straight-sets semi-final loss to eventual champion Novak Djokovic at Flushing Meadows.\nIn his first tournament since losing the final to Djokovic five weeks ago, Federer crashed to a 7-6 (7-4), 2-6, 6-3 loss to world No.70 Albert Ramos-Vinolas at the ATP Shanghai event on Tuesday.\nThe Spanish qualifier had lost all 15 of his previous matches against top-10 opponents and the result gives Federer pause for thought as he looks to extend a long season.\nThe Wimbledon and US Open runner-up is scheduled to wrap 2015 up at the ATP Finals in London, starting on November 15, before his short off-season break.\nCilic posted an impressive 6-1, 6-2 win over his highly-rated fellow Croatian Borna Coric, ranked 40th.\nSpain's Garbine Muguruza will play in Brisbane.
