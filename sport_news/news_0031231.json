Juergen Klopp is headed to ... more > By STEVE DOUGLAS -   \nJuergen Klopp takes over a Liverpool team in transition, in 10th place in the Premier League, and - unfortunately in the eyes of many fans - lumbered with the Europa League. \nHere’s a look at the immediate challenges facing Klopp as he settles in at Anfield as the replacement for Brendan Rodgers: \n___ \nIMPOSE STYLE \nKlopp has described his preferred approach as “heavy-metal football” - exciting, high tempo, high pressure and relentless. It asks a lot of his players but when it comes off, it’s worth all the effort. \nRodgers had a similar style in the 2013-14 season, when Liverpool almost won the Premier League title with Luis Suarez swarming over opposition defenses and at his prolific best. \nIs the current Liverpool squad capable of adapting to Klopp’s philosophy? And can Klopp’s approach work in the intense, exhausting English season where there is no winter break to recharge the batteries? \n___ \nFIX DEFENSE \nDefensively, Liverpool always seemed vulnerable under Rodgers, who preferred to focus more on the team’s attack. That may even have cost the Reds the Premier League title in 2014. \nMartin Skrtel has been a mainstay at center back but doesn’t have a reliable partner, there is no permanent fixture at left back, and Nathaniel Clyne is still settling in at right back after his offseason move from Southampton. \nMeanwhile, there hasn’t been adequate protection for the defense in center midfield since the decision to abandon the experiment of playing Steven Gerrard as an anchorman. It appears Lucas Leiva no longer has the legs for the role. \nThe whole defensive structure needs firming up, whether it’s through work on the training ground or manoeuvers in the transfer market. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:03:28.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
