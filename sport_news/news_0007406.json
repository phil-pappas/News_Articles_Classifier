Put the ball in to a good area and he knows how to go and attack it and make it his! #1-0benteke\" - former Liverpool striker Neil Mellor (?@NeilMellor33) was understandably impressed by the Belgian's goal. He was a little quieter after Mane levelled. \nRATINGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T20:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:25:08.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
