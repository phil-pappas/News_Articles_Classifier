Show Caption Previous Next \nESTERO — An action-packed week lies ahead for the Florida Everblades, who are set to play four games in five days. \nThe Blades (2-0) will conclude their season-opening home stand against the Norfolk Admirals on Wednesday. They will then hit the road to face the Atlanta Gladiators on Friday and Saturday and the Greenville Swamp Rabbits on Sunday. \n“It’s four games in five days with an overnight bus trip to Atlanta,” Blades sixth-year coach Greg Poss said. “We definitely tried to keep our practices short and sharp over the last couple of days.” \nPoss said the extensive week gives him an opportunity to use the team’s entire roster in order to keep his players fresh. \nThe Blades have three rookie skaters — defenseman Logan Roe, center Maxime St.-Cyr and right wing Jeff Jones — who have not yet suited up for a game. \n“They are really good players, and we see that in practice,” Poss said of his depth players. “We have to be a little patient right now, but eventually they will all get a chance. I’m confident that they will all do a very good job.” \nNorfolk will travel to Estero on Wednesday to try to blemish Florida’s perfect record. However, it was only three years ago when the Blades and Admirals were helping each other succeed. \nFrom 2010 to 2012, the Blades were the ECHL affiliate of the Admirals — whose parent club at the time were the Tampa Bay Lightning. Norfolk began a partnership with the Anaheim Ducks prior to the 2012-2013 season. However, the original Admirals franchise moved to San Diego prior to the 2015-2016 season in order to be closer to Anaheim. \nThe ECHL adopted Norfolk over the offseason, keeping minor league hockey alive in a thriving market. \n“It is a really traditional hockey market there in Norfolk,” Poss said. “It is a bit odd (to be playing a former affiliate), but Norfolk is a very good city for our league.” \nThe Blades will endure a quick turnaround following Wednesday’s game. They travel for a trio of South Division matchups this weekend. \nFlorida’s 6-1 victory over Atlanta on Saturday had a messy conclusion, with 50 penalty minutes — including four 10-minute misconducts — awarded during the third period. \nThe hostile conclusion to Saturday’s contest sets up an intriguing grudge match in Atlanta, where the winless Gladiators will attempt to seek their revenge. \n“I’m sure it’s going to be emotional because they only got one point last weekend,” Poss said. “If we put ourselves in that situation of only getting one point in two games, then we would really be ready for that game on Friday.” \nThe Gladiators do not play another game before Friday, setting up a crucial home-opener for Atlanta. \n“They will be a highly-motivated team,” Poss said. “We will see a much different team than we saw on Saturday night.” \nNorfolk Admirals at Florida Everblades When: Wednesday, 7:30 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:37:08.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
