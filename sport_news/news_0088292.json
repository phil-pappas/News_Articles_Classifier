The new guy, Eric O'Dell is fitting right in. he had two goals on five shots for the night and David Dziurzynski and Colin Greening rounded out the scoring last night. Between the pipes was Chris Driedger. He had 32 saves last night and only allowed one goal but that was on a self inflicted tally. Last year Chris went 6-0 at the end of the season here in Binghamton and Coach Richardson is noticing the good play from both O'Delll and Dreidger. \"He's a really good player. I didn't realize how hard he (O'Dell) worked. We didn't play St. John's enough to give him enough credit. We know he is a crafty player, he really makes some skilled plays out there and can be an offensive producer but man he works hard in the D zone and all over the ice. He is not afraid to bump into guys. So he's a real complete player,\" said Luke Richardson. \"Yeah, I guess we have just been playing well in front of me so far. When I came in last year, the team had been struggling a bit but my first couple games I got early in the year, the guys played well and we scored a bunch of goals,\" said Chris Dreidger, starting goaltender. The B-Sens now have a week to practice before heading up I-81 to take on the Syracuse Crunch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:28:17.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
