Sponsored by Jaguars 34, Bills 31 Oct. 25, Wembley Stadium, London EJ Manuel committed three turnovers in the second quarter, leading to 20 Jacksonville points. On back-to-back offensive plays, Manuel lost a fumble that was recovered for a TD and threw an interception that was returned for a touchdown. The Bills trailed by as many as 24 points, 27-3. Manuel rallied the Bills with TD passes to Robert Woods and Marcus Easley and a pick-six by Corey Graham gave the Bills a 31-27 lead with 5:21 remaining but Jacksonville QB Blake Bortles tossed the winning touchdown pass to Allen Hurns with 2:16 left. The bye week is next, and the Bills need it. Bengals 34, Bills 21 Oct. 18, Ralph Wilson Stadium With several injuries to the offense, the Bills (3-3) defense needed to step up. It got stepped on. Bengals (6-0) QB Andy Dalton passed for three touchdowns against a Buffalo defense that failed to sack him. EJ Manuel started for the injured Tyrod Taylor and was serviceable, throwing for 263 yards and a touchdown and rushing for another score. Buffalo is 1-3 at Ralph Wilson Stadium. The Bills should have an easier matchup next week against the 1-5 Jacksonville Jaguars in London. Bills 14, Titans 13 Oct. 11, Nissan Stadium, Nashville, Tenn. This was a laughable performance for the Bills for most of the game, but luckily, Tyrod Taylor came to the rescue. Taylor engineered two late scoring drives with the help of his running prowess and a 46-yard bomb to Chris Hogan to give Buffalo its first victory over the Titans since 2000. An ugly win if there ever was one, but a win nonetheless. Up next, the undefeated Bengals. Giants 24, Bills 10 Oct. 4, Ralph Wilson Stadium Flags, flags and more flags. The Bills couldn't stay out of trouble against Eli Manning and the Giants and sunk to .500 in defeat. Without stars LeSean McCoy and Sammy Watkins -- both sidelined with injuries -- the Bills' offense was mostly lifeless. Buffalo ran for just 55 yards (2.3 average) on 24 attempts. Bills 41, Dolphins 14 Sept. 27, Sun Life Stadium Tyrod Taylor played like a seasoned veteran, Buffalo's defense looked like the one Rex Ryan has been bragging about, and the Miami Dolphins were, well, an absolute train wreck. Add it up and the Bills embarrassed their AFC East rivals 41-14 at muggy Sun Life Stadium. Patriots 40, Bills 32 Sept. 20, Ralph Wilson Stadium The Ralph was rockin'. Then it wasn't. Then it was again. But in the end, the Patriots did what they always seem to do ... beat the Bills. Tom Brady threw for 466 yards and 3 TDs as New England dominated much of the game before allowing three fourth-quarter scores to make things interesting. Alas, on the Bills' final drive, Tyrod Taylor threw his third interception to end hopes of a miraculous comeback. Despite a lot of talk all week, the Pats proved they are still tops in the division. Bills 27, Colts 14 Sept. 13, Ralph Wilson Stadium They say it's not how you start, but how you finish. Well, \"they\" would still be quite impressed with what the Bills did in Week 1 against Andrew Luck and the Colts. Buffalo put on a show and QB Tyrod Taylor made his coaches look smart with an efficient stat line and an impressive 51-yard TD bomb to Percy Harvin to ignite the crowd. After the Bills scored on their opening drive of the second half to open up a 24-0 lead, the party was on. What's next for the Bills? Scroll ahead to look at the rest of the Bills schedule this season. Week 8 Nov. 8, 1 p.m. Ralph Wilson Stadium Coming off the bye, this is the first of three key AFC East games in a row for Buffalo. The Bills have defeated the Dolphins three straight years at home and will look to extend it to four for the first time in the series' history. Week 10 Nov. 12, 8:25 p.m. (Thursday night) Met Life Stadium The Bills visit Rex Ryan's former home in their first of two primtetime games this season. They also begin a stretch of five games on the road in six weeks -- something they haven't done since 1991. Week 11 Nov. 23, 8:30 p.m. (Monday night) Gillette Stadium The Bills finally won in Foxborough last season -- the first time in 13 tries -- in the final game of the year. This game will be a Monday nighter and not since 2009 have the Bills played two prime-time games in one season. Week 12 Nov. 29, 1 p.m. Arrowhead Stadium After the Patriots game, the Bills have to turn around on short rest and travel to Kansas City. That's just as tough a task as playing a team coming off extra rest. The NFL did the Bills no favors with that one. Week 13 Dec. 6, 1 p.m. Ralph Wilson Stadium J.J. Watt, arguably the best defensive player in the NFL, has a new buddy in Houston and someone with which the Bills are quite familiar. Former Patriot Vince Wilfork joined the team this offseason, signing a two-year contract. Houston defeated Buffalo, 23-17, last season. Week 14 Dec. 13, 1 p.m. Lincoln Financial Field Of course Rex returning to Met Life is a big deal. But another new Bill has this one circled on his calendar. Running back LeSean McCoy was traded to the Bills for young linebacker Kiko Alonso in the offseason and most likely wants to put on a good show for his former fans. Week 15 Dec. 20, 1 p.m. FedExField The Bills have struggled mightily in recent years, but they have had Washington's number. The Bills are 6-0 against the Redskins since 1993. Week 16 Dec. 27, 1 p.m. Ralph Wilson Stadium Tony Romo is clearly among one of the better QBs the Bills face in 2015. Interestingly, Buffalo is at home in most cases where it faces an elite (or near-elite) quarterback (Brady, Romo, Luck, Manning). Week 17 Jan. 3, 1 p.m. Ralph Wilson Stadium A fitting end to the season with Rex Ryan hosting his former team at the Ralph. In the 55 years the Bills have been playing in the AFL and NFL, they have never played a slate where they start with two games at home and finish with their last two at home.

Mandatory Credit: Steve Flynn-USA TODAY Sports (Photo: Steve Flynn-USA TODAY Sports) Story Highlights The Jaguars scored four touchdowns in a span of 5:40 early in the second quarter. Jacksonville snapped a four-game losing streak and the Bills fell to 3-4. \nLONDON - Not EJ Manuel's finest moment, or two, or three, Sunday afternoon at historic Wembley Stadium. \nFor about five minutes in the second quarter, the beleaguered Buffalo backup quarterback – thrust into the starting role because of Tyrod Taylor's knee injury – put forth one of the most egregious quarterbacking performances in Bills history. \nNow think about that for a second, and consider the context. Think about all the horrendous play we've seen from countless Bills quarterbacks through the years – basically every year outside of a few in the 1960s by Jack Kemp, a few in the 1980s by Joe Ferguson, and several by Jim Kelly in the late 80s and early - to mid-90s – and those five-plus minutes were among the worst ever recorded. \n\"Just bad football,\" Manuel admitted following the Bills deeply disappointing 34-31 loss to the previously woebegone Jacksonville Jaguars in front of 84,021 thoroughly entertained fans. \nYeah, you could say that. \nReport card: Your turn to grade the Bills \nIf you can stomach this, here's what happened. \nLess than two minutes after Jacksonville had taken a 7-3 lead, LeSean McCoy whiffed on a blitz pick-up, which was not Manuel's fault. What was his fault is he didn't secure the ball, and Chris Clemons scooped and scored from six yards away. Seven seconds later, Manuel threw an absolutely perfect pass, if Jags linebacker Telvin Smith was the intended target. It could not have been an easier interception and 26-yard touchdown return. \nJust like that the Bills were down 21-3 and the thousands of western New Yorkers who made the trip to this fabulous city were wondering what was the point. But Manuel wasn't done. Four plays later, it was ex-Bill Paul Posluszny's turn to get in on the fun as he picked Manuel at the Buffalo 36. That set up T.J. Yeldon's 28-yard touchdown romp as he broke at least two tackles at the line. Despite a missed conversion, it was 27-3. \n\"No, I didn't,\" coach Rex Ryan said when asked if he considered pulling Manuel at that point. \"He had too good a week in preparation and on the practice field to end it like that.\" \nSeriously? This is how he played after a good week of prep and practice? \n\"I don't think I necessarily cost the team the game,\" said Manuel, who completed 24 of 42 for 298 yards. \"I know two early plays for touchdowns they scored on hurt our team. But I don't think any one play necessarily changed the game for us.\" Jacksonville Jaguars defensive tackle Tyson Alualu (93) sacks Buffalo Bills quarterback EJ Manuel (3) during the NFL game between Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars at Wembley Stadium in London Sunday.
