Nick Tice might have been a question mark at the start. He’s not now. As the Hawks (5-1) prepare to host Falmouth (6-0) Friday in a game that could decide first place in Class B South, they’re hitting their stride on both sides of the ball. But it’s the defense that’s come the farthest since it entered the year with just four starters back from the Class B title team of 2014. Tice? He wasn’t one of those guys. “I was behind Brett,” he said smiling. Brett, of course, was Fitzpatrick Trophy winner Brett Gerry, who in addition to rushing for more than 2,200 yards was a standout at outside linebacker, with both the speed to get to the ball and the physicality to make tackles. The 6-foot-2, 180-pound Tice watched, got lots of snaps in mop-up time and learned. When his senior year rolled around, he was a starter on both sides of the ball, at outside linebacker and tight end. As his senior year has gone on, he’s shown why. “Nick Tice is probably the guy who’s given us the biggest boost on defense,” said Marshwood coach Alex Rotsko. “He didn’t play at all on defense last year. He’s just a smart player who understands the system and makes good decisions. He’s been a plus for us.” It’s not that Tice and a lot of this year’s other starters didn’t play last year; it’s that they didn’t play meaningful snaps for a Hawks juggernaut that won 11 of its 12 games by at least 26 points. The exception was the 14-13 win over York in the regional final. “We have a bunch of guys like that,” said Rotsko. “They didn’t start any games but they did get a lot of playing time. In 12 games, our second and third teams probably played in 11 games; in some games they got more playing time than the starters.” That doesn’t mean those guys showed up at camp in August with everything figured out. But Tice’s learning curve has been the shortest. “He’s one of the smartest kids, both on the field and off, that we have here,” said Rotsko. “He has a great understanding of what we’re doing. Those kinds of kids are really invaluable to a coaching staff.” When Rotsko’s teams are going well, they’re winning the turnover battle, often by a lot. That wasn’t the case in Week 3, when they coughed the ball up six times in a 16-13 loss to Westbrook, the program’s first home loss since 2011. The last three games have been better. After holding on to beat Leavitt by denying a late two-point conversion try, the Hawks dominated Gorham (61-8) and previously unbeaten Kennebunk (61-14). In Saturday’s game at Kennebunk, Tice intercepted two passes in the third quarter to snuff any Rams hopes of getting back in the game. “He’s a playmaker,” said inside linebacker Zach Mitchell. “It seems like he comes out of nowhere and makes a pick, about every single game.” Last year, Tice was behind both Gerry and the team’s other starting outside linebacker, Zach Doyon. This year, he and Doyon are manning the outside while Mitchell and Justin Stacy are inside, backing up a stout defensive line comprised of Holden Jackman, Chika Nbuaquide, Loukas Coussoule and Trevor Messier. “You’ve got to make sure when you are practicing behind guys like that to know your role, know if they go down what you have to do,” said Tice. “You have to take the mental reps during practice to be prepared.” What he’s noticed is that the Marshwood defense, under the oversight of coordinator Tim Briggs, is usually prepared. “(Briggs) puts us in the best defensive situation each week, just making adjustments that other coaches just don’t see,” said Tice. “I think we must play the most defenses in Maine — cover-2, cover-3, combinations of man … we just play so many.” The Hawks will need to be good defensively against Falmouth, a team that’s shown it can attack on the ground (with tough back Connor Aube) and through the air (with promising sophomore Jack Bryant, who has ably taken over for standout Noah Nelson). “Their quarterback, for a young kid playing for the first time … he looks very poised,” said Rotsko. “We’re going to have to get some pressure on him.” By Mike Zhe", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:17:16.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
