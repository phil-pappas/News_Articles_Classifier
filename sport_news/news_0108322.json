The program wasn't growing like he wanted. The outdoor boxing ring was in shambles and all efforts to secure an indoor space fpr the team had failed.Beck said he sat in the field near the ring and began to pray.\"I asked God what He wanted me to do,\" Beck said. \"More or less, He told me that all these years I had God behind me, but I needed to have God in front of me. I had to put him first.\"Soon after, Beck became ordained through Universal Ministries. He considers himself a missionary — his field is the troubled youth of the area, and his doctrine is a boxing ring.\"We don't just teach boxing,\" he said. \"We mentor. We take anyone. We don't charge anything. We take kids who smoke or have trouble at school, and we try and turn their lives around.\"Dream Team Boxing is poised to embark on its 2015 season with nine boxers of varying ages. The 10th edition of Pugilism in Pottsville, Dream Team Boxing's only home event, is in the works and a donation of $700 worth of metal toward the construction of a roof mean one thing for Beck: God is working through his program.Kylie Southerland, who has been with the program for three months, said it has turned her life around.\"Well, for starters, I lost 35 pounds,\" she said. \"I quit smoking. I quit drinking soda. I only drink water. That was the original reason I got into it. I always had an interest in boxing, but it wasn't until I saw Dream Team on Facebook that I started to think it was possible for me. I am a lot healthier now.\"Beck said Pugilism in Pottsville, an official USA Boxing licensed event, costs around $1,000 each year — money that is typically out of pocket.Participants receive trophies and the \"Boxer of the Night\" receives a championship belt, which must be defended the following year or forfeited.Beck said he wasn't sure when Dream Team would head to its first match — but he would know very soon.Those interested in donating to Dream Team Boxing can contact Beck at 479-393-1998 or email diamonddream1995@gmail.com.Beck said Dream Team will begin competing in October.
