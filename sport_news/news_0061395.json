On Friday Geist's owner filed a $2 million lawsuit against the police department. A heartbroken Salt Lake City man is suing his local police department for $2 million after he says a gun-toting detective unjustly shot and killed his beloved dog.\nSean Kendall's lawsuit filed Friday comes a little more than a year after his \"best friend,\" a 2-year-old Weimaraner named Geist, was killed in his gated backyard.\n\"Geist was robbed of the vast majority of his life, and Kendall was robbed of Geist's continued life with him, which cannot be replaced any more than a child or other family member can be replaced,\" his lawsuit, obtained by the Deseret News , reads.\nKendall's suit seeks $1.5 million in special damages and $500,000 in punitive damages from Salt Lake City Police Detective Brett Olsen, who fired the fatal shot, and Olsen's commander that day, Lt. Brian Purvis.\nKSL.COM Geist's owner, Sean Kendeall, said the officers had no right to search his backyard or to use lethal force against his best friend. The officers were searching for a missing 3-year-old boy when they entered Kendall's backyard on June 18 and were confronted by the protective pure breed.\nThe 110-pounder, whose owner said had undergone training as a puppy, was described as approaching them \"in an aggressive manner,\" leading to him being killed on the spot.\nThe missing child was found about 30 minutes later, asleep in his home.\nYouTube/YouTube The 2-year-old dog is seen lying dead in his owner's backyard after the June 18, 2014 shooting. Kendall demanded that Olsen be fired and the police department's officer undergo training on how to better deal with pets, notably in telling aggressive and non-aggressive dogs apart.\nOlsen was ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing by the police department's civilian review board.\nKendall's suit, however, accuses the search on his property, and others in the area, as having been warrantless.\nThe dog's shooting sparked national attention and rallying by thousands both online and in the streets.\nAn online petition against Olsen racked up more than 73,000 signatures, an online legal aid fund for Kendall pulled in more than $25,500 and hundreds rallied outside Salt Lake City police headquarters in July 2014.\nON A MOBILE DEVICE?
