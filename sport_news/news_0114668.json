Always remember think before you speak.\"\nRELATED: Longhorns led to slaughter by TCU\nDeAndre McNeal, a freshman wide receiver, then chimed in with a long message on his account.\n\"We're supposed to be a team, but instead we're bashing each other,\" McNeal wrote. \"If you don't want to be here at Texas then kick rocks. We haven't won ANYTHING to have people calling out others.\"\nAsked if all of this is a sign of a divide between young and old players on the team, senior defensive back Duke Thomas tried to downplay it, but said, \"There may be a little bit of a disconnect.\"\nStrong said Boyd — who will be disciplined internally but will play against Oklahoma on Saturday — apologized to the team for his halftime Twitter use. Even though one of the messages was from a fan urging him to transfer to Texas A&M, Boyd — who reposts almost everything sent to him, including tens of thousands of messages — explained he didn't intend that as a slight against UT (1-4 overall, 0-2 in the Big 12).\nThomas said the only person in the locker room who saw Boyd on his phone at halftime was safety Adrian Colbert, who told Boyd to put it down. Thomas said during the second half, the Longhorns heard from fans in the stadium that Boyd had been on Twitter at halftime.\n\"When he did that, everyone felt disrespected,\" Thomas said. \"(But) he didn't think anything was wrong with it.\"\nThomas said younger players are so \"embedded\" in social media that they don't realize how everything they post can be misconstrued. Junior defensive tackle Hassan Ridgeway said the social-media furor was overblown, and insisted there isn't a rift between UT's younger and older players.\nBut Ridgeway did acknowledge \"players are getting on players,\" and said those being criticized need to handle it better.\n\"Sometimes people have to suck it up and understand where it's coming from,\" Ridgeway said. \"A teammate is trying to help you out, not hurt you.\"\nmfinger@express-news.net\nTwitter: @MikeFinger", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/11/8733291/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/05/8733044/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/05/8733051/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/05/8733045/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/12/8733317/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/05/8733049/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/05/8733037/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/05/8733046/4/920x920.png", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/11/8733306/4/920x920.png", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/11/8733304/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/05/8733040/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/05/8733042/4/920x920.png", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/05/8733045/4/920x920.png", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/05/8733041/4/920x920.png", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/05/8733037/4/920x920.png", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/05/8733038/4/920x920.png", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/05/8733042/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/05/8733049/4/920x920.png", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/11/8733257/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/05/8733038/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/11/8733257/4/920x920.png", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/05/8733050/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/12/8733317/4/920x920.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/11/8733267/4/920x920.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/05/8733051/4/920x920.png", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/11/8733304/4/920x920.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/11/8733291/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/11/8733306/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/05/8733041/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/05/8733044/4/920x920.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/11/8733267/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "https://twitter.com/mikefinger", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/05/8733040/4/920x920.png", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/05/8733050/4/920x920.png", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/24/05/8733046/4/square_gallery_thumb.png"], "published": "2015-10-06T00:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:05:41.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
