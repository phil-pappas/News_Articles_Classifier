Manager John Gibbons and bench coach DeMarlo Hale also came out to break up the dispute. \nCliff Pennington replaced Tulowitzki, entering at second base, while Ryan Goins moved from second to shortstop. \nTrailing 2-0 in the best-of-seven series, the Blue Jays lead 11-4.

Donaldson went deep in that game as well, along with Chris Colabello and Kevin Pillar. \nDonaldson has three homers this postseason, matching the Blue Jays record held by Joe Carter (1992), Candy Maldonado (1992) and Paul Molitor (1993). \nThe Blue Jays reached double figures in runs for the third time in their postseason history. Toronto beat Philadelphia 10-3 in Game 3 of the 1993 World Series, then used a six-run eighth inning to outslug the Phillies 15-14 in Game 4.

After an easy first, Cueto allowed 11 of his next 13 batters to reach, while Toronto fans serenaded him with the sing-song chants of \"Cueto-Ceuto\" throughout his outing. He smiled as he walked off the mound, hurling his gum as he neared the dugout.

Goins took the blame for letting a shallow fly drop in for a hit during Game 2, starting a five-run rally for Kansas City. The starting pitcher in that 6-3 Toronto loss, David Price, led the cheers from the dugout after Goins' hit. \nBlue Jays starter Marcus Stroman was the first to greet Goins after he scored the team's third run in the second inning — equaling Toronto's total for the series to that point.

After Ben Zobrist's grounder scored the first run, Pillar made a fantastic catch on Lorenzo Cain's drive to straightaway center. Pillar grabbed the ball on the run and crashed into the fence. He gave the OK sign while sitting on the warning track. Pitcher Marcus Stroman turned to the outfield and applauded into his glove.

White played for the Blue Jays teams that won back-to-back World Series titles in 1992 and 1993. He's remembered for his spectacular catch on a deep drive by Atlanta's David Justice in Game 3 of the 1992 World Series. \nLeft-hander Mark Buehrle, who is not on Toronto's playoff roster, was behind the plate for White's first pitch. \n___ Kansas City Royals starting pitcher Johnny Cueto throws his gum after being pulled from the game during the third inning in Game 3 of baseball's American League Championship Series against the Toronto Blue Jays on Monday, Oct. 19, 2015, in Toronto.

Yes, that Patrick.

The team reserves the right to cut off beer sales after the fifth inning if there are any problems.

He wouldn't say how many Toronto police officers would be at Monday's game, but said the number was \"fairly high.\" \n\"We reviewed all our staffing levels and police deployment and we're confident that was adequate,\" Coutinho said. \nIn the seventh inning of Toronto's Game 5 win over Texas in the ALDS, a raucous crowd turned rowdy when Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin hit Texas batter Shin-Soo Choo with his seemingly routine return throw to the pitcher, resulting in a go-ahead run for the Rangers. During an 18-minute delay to sort out the ruling, fans tossed beer cans among other garbage. Many of the cans didn't reach the field, striking fans in the seats close to the field.
