The students, their book bags and their lockers were all searched, and no weapons were found at the school. Two pellet guns were recovered from a home where the students admitted placing them.\nThe two juveniles who allegedly made the threats were arrested for aggravated assault and released into the custody of their parents.\nThe incident is still under investigation, and the Sheriff's Office is working closely with the St. Tammany Parish School System to resolve the issue.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
