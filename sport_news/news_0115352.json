More contenders are set to stand. \nPlatini, who helped force Champagne's exit from FIFA in 2010, is suspended by the FIFA ethics committee and unlikely to be accepted as a candidate. The UEFA president is appealing against his ban for taking a US$2 million salary payment nine years after he worked as Blatter's personal adviser. \nBlatter, who is also suspended for paying Platini from FIFA funds in 2011, called the election amid a deepening corruption crisis in June. He announced his planned exit just four days after winning re-election despite FIFA then being subject to American and Swiss criminal investigations of bribery and suspected money-laundering. \nChampagne gets a second chance to lead FIFA because of the scandals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:36:22.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
