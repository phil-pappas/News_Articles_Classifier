Ben Bishop stopped 27 shots. It was Tampa Bay's first win in Boston since March 25, 2010. \nLoui Eriksson had two power-play goals, and David Krejci also had one for Boston. The Bruins have opened with three straight losses for the first time since 1999. \nTuukka Rask made 17 saves for the Bruins. \nBoston captain Zdeno Chara played his first game after missing most of the preseason with an undisclosed upper-body injury. \nISLANDERS 4, JETS 2 \nNEW YORK (AP) — John Tavares had a power-play goal and added two assists, Thomas Greiss made 22 saves and New York beat Winnipeg for its first victory in its new Brooklyn home. \nThe Islanders came out with purpose after losing their opening two games to the defending champion Blackhawks, one in overtime at home and the other in regulation in Chicago. \nThe Islanders outshot the Jets 16-6 in the opening period and had a 20-9 shots advantage in the second. Jets goalie Ondrej Pavelec made a number of key saves in the first as the Islanders had four power-play chances. \nRyan Strome banged in a rebound with a man advantage at 19:48 of the first, giving the Brooklyn matinee crowd a chance to launch the standard \"Yes! Yes! Yes!\" chant. Tavares and Kyle Okposo assisted on Strome's first of the season. \nCANUCKS 2, DUCKS 1, SO \nANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Radim Vrbata and Alex Burrows scored in the shootout and Vancouver spoiled Anaheim's home opener. \nRyan Miller made 28 saves and Adam Cracknell scored in regulation for Vancouver, which beat the Ducks for just the third time in their last 12 meetings. \nSami Vatanen scored and Frederik Andersen stopped 24 shots for the Ducks, who are winless in the first two games of the season. \nAfter the Ducks failed to score on a power play during their first taste of 3-on-3 overtime hockey, Vrbata and Burrows got stuttering, halting shots past Andersen, who stopped Burrows' shot before watching it trickle under him. \nFLYERS 1, PANTHERS 0 \nPHILADELPHIA (AP) — Michael Neuvirth stopped 31 shots for his first shutout in more than 3 1/2 years, leading Philadelphia past Florida. \nBrayden Schenn scored to help the Flyers win for the first time in three games this season. \nNeuvirth replaced Steve Mason after Florida scored four goals in a 7-1 victory Saturday night. Mason left the team Monday because of unspecified personal reasons, giving Neuvirth the chance to shut down the Panthers from the opening faceoff. He had his first shutout since March 11, 2012, against Toronto. \nPhiladelphia coach Dave Hakstol won for the first time in the NHL game after spending 11 seasons coaching North Dakota. The college-to-pros move in the NHL is a rare one. Hakstol was the first to make the jump since Bob Johnson went from Wisconsin to the Calgary Flames in 1982. \nSABRES 4, BLUE JACKETS 2 \nBUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) — Rookie star Jack Eichel scored a hustling unassisted goal and Buffalo beat Columbus to give coach Dan Bylsma his first victory with the Sabres. \nEichel, the former Boston University player selected No. 2 overall in the June draft, bodied off Boone Jenner in a loose-puck battle, kept the puck in the offensive zone, wheeled to his forehand and ripped a shot over goalie Sergei Bobrovsky to give Buffalo a 3-1 lead at 9:21 of the third period. Eichel has two goals this season. \nRasmus Ristolainen, Ryan O'Reilly and Matt Moulson had power-play goals for Buffalo. Moulson added two assists, and Chad Johnson made 21 saves to help Buffalo rebound after losing its first two games of the season. \nScott Hartnell and Brandon Saad scored for Columbus, and Bobrovsky stopped 29 shots.
