But that doesn't mean there won't be drama impacting the national title picture.\nUtah and Clemson will hit the road against dangerous opponents. Texas A&M and Ole Miss meet with both teams trying to stay in the SEC title race. There will be a couple heated matchups in Norman and Tuscaloosa.\nHere's a look at the decisive factors in five of Saturday's biggest contests (all times Eastern):\nTexas A&M defense vs. Chad Kelly TIME/TV: 7 p.m., Saturday, ESPN\nOctober has not been kind to Mississippi. The Rebels looked poised to be national title contenders after beating Alabama. Since then there have been lukewarm performances and two bad losses to Florida and Memphis. Many of the problems lie with a defense that has gave up 75 points in the losses. But the bigger issue has been the inconsistent play of Kelly. The quarterback hasn't been good enough to carry an offense with a mediocre game.\nThe Aggies have been greatly improved on defense with new coordinator John Chavis, especially against the pass. Defensive end Myles Garrett makes a major impact rushing the passer. The secondary hasn't allowed more than 225 yards per game through the air and is limiting quarterbacks to just more than 6 yards per attempt.\nAs long as quarterback Kyle Allen bounces back after his poor performance against Alabama, the Aggies should have success moving the ball. Slowing down Kelly gives the Aggies a great chance to stay alive in the SEC title race.\nDevontae Booker vs. USC front seven TIME/TV: 7:30 p.m., Saturday, Fox\nThe Trojans are reeling after two consecutive losses and the departure of coach Steve Sarkisian. Utah enters this game unbeaten after being one of the best teams in the first half of the season. Yet, it is USC that is favored in this matchup.\nThe Trojans certainly have the skill players to score against the Utes. The bigger question is whether their first game at home since the switch to interim coach Clay Helton gives them the emotion to improve a struggling defense. USC ranks 75th in the country in total defense and gives up 175 yards per game on the ground.\nExpect to see a heavy dose of Booker early from Utah to see if the Trojans are able to stop him. The senior is effective both between the tackles and outside. His physical style can also wear down USC. Once the runs game is established, the Utes can then turn to their passing game with Travis Wilson. That should help neutralize that Trojans offense and allow Utah to escape Los Angeles unscathed.\nClemson quarterback Deshaun Watson looks to throw against Louisville. (Photo: Jamie Rhodes, USA TODAY Sports)\nDeshaun Watson vs. Brad Kaaya TIME/TV: Noon, Saturday, ABC\nThis is Clemson's second road game after a narrow win at Louisville. That victory and a home win against Notre Dame represent the two worst performances this season by the quarterback Watson, who threw for just 283 yards and three interceptions combined. Despite his talents, the sophomore quarterback is still prone to mistakes. The Hurricanes, who are ranked No. 1 in turnover margin are more than capable of making him pay for poor decisions. Kaaya, meanwhile, has thrown just one interception and showcased his development by picking apart Florida State and Virginia Tech the previous two weeks. Miami's hope of an upset rests on his arm and whether he can outplay Watson. In what should be an offensive shootout, having the better quarterback likely will be the difference.\nOklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield is chased by Kansas State defensive end Jordan Willis. (Photo: Scott Sewell, USA TODAY Sports)\nBaker Mayfield vs. Kliff Kingsbury TIME/TV: 3:30 p.m., Saturday, ABC/ESPN2\nIt's fair to say Baker Mayfield has been waiting two years for this moment. Since his transfer from Texas Tech to Oklahoma, the quarterback has been waiting to get back at his former team and, specifically, Kliff Kingsbury. It was Kingsbury's decision to not release Mayfield, then a non-scholarship player, that forced the junior to sit out last season and lose a year of eligibility.\nThe challenge for Mayfield won't be the Red Raiders defense, as Tech is one of the worst statistical defenses in the country. The challenge will be to control his emotion and stay within the framework of the offense. His biggest struggle this season came against Texas, another game that was emotional for the Austin native. Trying to do too much and force passes is a recipe for turnovers and stalled drives.\nWhat the Red Raiders can do is score. A lot. And the Sooners have struggled against spread passing attacks. So any missed opportunities by the offense to put points on the board will give Texas Tech hope of an upset.\nTennessee running game vs. Derrick Henry TIME/TV: 3:30 p.m., Saturday, CBS\nNo longer played routinely on the third Saturday in October, the rivalry between Alabama and Tennessee and Alabama remains one of the biggest in the SEC despite recent domination by the Crimson Tide. The Volunteers have lost nine consecutive games in the series, with eight of those defeats by at least 14 points. To reverse the trend, they'll have to succeed where most Alabama opponents have failed: winning the battle of the running game. The Crimson Tide has been dominant on both sides of the ball. They allow 70.9 yards per game and 2.4 yards per carry, and Henry is among the nation's top running backs.\nTennessee will turn to running back Jalen Hurd and quarterback Joshua Dobbs in its attempt to control the ball on the ground. Dobbs is the type of spread quarterback that has given Alabama trouble recently. Without a running threat, however, Dobbs will become one-dimensional which plays right into the hands of an opportunistic Tide secondary that returned three interceptions for touchdowns last week. It also means more time on the field for the Volunteers defense to deal with Henry and his explosive ability.\nPHOTOS: TOP 10 COLLEGE FOOTBALL GAMES OF WEEK 8\nWisconsin at Illinois, Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET on Big Ten Network USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Northwestern at Nebraska, Saturday at noon on ESPN2 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Penn State vs. Maryland in Baltimore, Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET on ESPN USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Memphis at Tulsa, Friday at 8 p.m. ET on ESPN USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Tennessee at No. 8 Alabama, Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET on CBS USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 6 Clemson at Miami, Saturday at noon ET on ABC/ESPN USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 19 California at UCLA, Thursday at 9 p.m. ET on ESPN USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Texas Tech at No. 15 Oklahoma, Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET on ABC/ESPN2 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 16 Texas A&M at No. 23 Ole Miss, Saturday at 7 p.m. ET on ESPN USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 7 Utah at USC, Saturday at 7:30 p.m. ET on FOX USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Like this topic?
