By Wires \nWhen Barcelona fans dreamed of Neymar doing something extraordinary and amazing in their match against Sevilla they would not have hoped for this. \nThe Brazilian curled an exquisite free-kick over the wall which comprehensively beat goalkeeper Sergio Rico. \nHowever, no one could account for what would happen next as the ball ricocheted off one post, struck Rico on the back, hit the same post for a second time, then rolled agonisingly along the goalline before eventually being cleared away to safety. \nIt really was utterly remarkable. Here it is in a series of screenshots: \n1 - Neymar takes a delightful free-kick, beating the wall and the goalkeeper… \n2 - The ball strikes the post for the first time (there’s plenty more drama to come)… \n3 - The ball strikes Rico on the back… \n4 - The ball hits the post for a second time… \n5 - The ball begins its agonising path along the goalline… \n6 - Yep, the ball’s still rolling along the line… \n7 - And finally, away to safety! \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
