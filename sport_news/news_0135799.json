Following the turnover, Cardinals’ Kimonte Wilson (#6) ran 20 yards for a Touchdown. On the next drive, the bulldogs fumbled again which was recovered by the Cardinals at the Bulldogs’ 38 yard line. Shortly after, the Cardinals scored on a two yard touchdown by DJ Franklin (#8). The score at the end of the first quarter was 13-0 Cardinals. In the second quarter, the Cardinals reached the endzone again but was called back by a holding penalty. They made up for it though, as Cardinals’ Kimonte Wilson threw a touchdown pass to Johnathan McCoy (#33). A turnover on downs by the bulldogs lead to a touchdown pass to Jordan Semple (#2) with 1:56 left in the first half. At halftime, the Bulldogs failed to put anything on the board as the cardinals were ahead 26-0. In the third quarter, the Bulldogs continued to struggle on offense as they had yet to score. However, Bulldogs’ Tyler Moss (4) scored a 10 yard touchdown from the wildcat formation on the first play of the fourth quarter. Following the score, the Bulldogs tried to keep it going and went for an onside kick which they recovered. It didn’t do any good, as the Bulldogs missed a field goal with 7:22 left in the game. On the next play, Cardinals’ Kimonte Wilson ran 70 yards for yet another touchdown. Later in the Fourth quarter, Bulldogs’ Tyler Moss scored from the three yard line making the score 33-15. That score would hold as the Bulldogs lost yet again, making them 0-5 for the season. They will try to break their losing streak this Friday at White Hall Bulldog Stadium as they take on Hot Springs Lakeside at 7 p.m. By Brice Hoffmanfor the White Hall Journal The   By Brice Hoffmanfor the White Hall Journal Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 12:01 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:03:23.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
