And the penalty was a crucial moment in the game with the result 1-1. \n\"And, I repeat, if the FA wants to punish me, they can punish me. They don't punish other managers, they punish me, but it's not a problem for me. \n\"I want to repeat because I think my players deserve it, Chelsea fans deserve it, I am a Chelsea fan too, and I want to say it again: referees are afraid to give decisions to Chelsea.\" \nChelsea have struggled for consistency this season, with the defending Premier League champions 16th in the table, already some 10 points behind leaders Manchester City ahead of this weekend's home clash with Aston Villa. \nMourinho said he would only quit if he lost the backing of the players, with club captain John Terry stating the dressing room remained firmly behind the manager, while ahead of the international break, Chelsea subsequently took the unusual step of reiterating their backing in a statement on the official club website which read: ''The club wants to make it clear that Jose continues to have our full support.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:08:19.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
