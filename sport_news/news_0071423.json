If you look at the quality they have it is unbelievable and they are good lads as well. \n“Diafra holds the ball well for us and lets us do our runs. We are enjoying our football at the moment and I think I have got goals in me, as well as setting up chances as well. \n“We just want to keep working hard together as a team and keep scoring goals.” \nMoses has struggled to make a name for himself at Stamford Bridge since arriving in west London from Wigan for £9 million. \nThe former Crystal Palace man has had spells on loan with both Liverpool and Stoke and is keen on putting all his attentions into his performances at West Ham. \n“I want to let my football do the talking,'”he added.
