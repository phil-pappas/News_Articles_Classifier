The Missionaries, off a 3-0 win over Lewis and Clark on Friday, dropped the first set 25-16 to the Bearcats, but never trailed in set 2. The Missionaries evened the match at 1-1 with a 25-23 win. An Anna Dawson service ace open a 23-22 Whitman lead in the third set before the Bearcats rallied to steal the win with a 3-0 run. Willamette closed the night with a five-point win in the fourth set, 25-20. The win improves the Bearcats to a conference leading 7-1 and 11-5 overall. The visiting Bearcats looked as if they might run away with the night in the opener, rolling out to a quick lead that blossomed into a 15-point cushion. But behind serving from Hannah Linsenmayer the Missionaries clawed their way back into the match with an 8-0 run before Willamette could re-balance itself and close out the first set. In the fourth set, Willamette raced to a 6-0 lead before Whitman would answer with six of the next seven points to pull within one at 7-6. The Missionaries reluctantly succumbed to a 4-1 Bearcats run that closed out the fourth set and gave the Bearcats the 3-1 match win. One of the differences on the night was Willamette’s defensive work at the net as the Bearcats piled up 16 blocks to only five by Whitman. Along with Seethoff’s career night the Whitman attack picked up 11 kills from Natalia Zea, the second highest total in her career. In Friday action, Whitman blanked Lewis & Clark College 3-0. The win marked Whitman’s sixth consecutive win over the Pioneers. The Missionaries defeated L & C 25-13, 25-18, and in extra time completed the sweep with a 27-25 win. Shae Kanakaole posted a match-high 16 kills for the host Missionaries but the decisive point in set 3 came via a block from Megan Henry and Brooke Randall. Seethoff added 13 kills as the Missionary offense combined for 42 kills on the match. The offense was set in motion by Dawson who dished out a match-high 33 assists. The Missionaries (2-6 NWC, 4-10 overall) host Pacific Lutheran Saturday at 5 p.m. More like this story", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:51:25.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
