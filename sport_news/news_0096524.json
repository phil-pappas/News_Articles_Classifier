The network announced that Remy will return for his 29th season as the color analyst, working alongside new play-by-play announcer Dave O’Brien. \nRemy will not work all the games. NESN announced that Dennis Eckersley and Steve Lyons will work as analysts “for a significant number of games.” The network will occasionally use a three-man announcing team with O’Brien and different combinations of Remy, Eckersley and Lyons. \nO’Brien, nationally known for his work with ESPN, had been a Red Sox radio announcer for the past nine years.
