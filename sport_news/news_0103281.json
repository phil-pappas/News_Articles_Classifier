It was the Lady Hoyas’ sixth straight area championship. Photo special to the MDJ slideshow MARIETTA — It’s rare to see a volleyball team come back from a nine-point deficit to win a set, especially when the other team is only two points away from winning.Harrison managed to pull it off in the first set of Saturday’s Area 4 championship against North Cobb at Marietta High School. Once the Lady Hoyas overcame the odds, they seized momentum and claimed their sixth straight area title with a 25-23, 25-18, 25-18 over the Lady Warriors.With the win, Harrison will host Alpharetta on Thursday in the first round of the Class state tournament. North Cobb will put its state title defense at stake when it hosts Johns Creek.Hillgrove beat Kennesaw Mountain in straight sets for the area’s third seed and will play at Lambert. No. 4 Kennesaw Mountain will travel to Area 6 champion South Forsyth.In attempt to win its first area title since 2009, North Cobb picked up where it left off when it beat Harrison in straight sets last week to claim the No. 1 seed for the area tournament. The Lady Warriors dictated points with their serve, ran their offense effectively and capitalized on Harrison mistakes. Everything seemed to be going right for North Cobb (34-15) when Moriah Hopkins and Shannon Callan blocked a Harrison attack to take a 23-14 first-set lead.But Katie Doering, who led Harrison (29-9) with 11 kills, hit a smash on the first pass to put the Lady Hoyas back on serve. She then served 10 straight points to win the set.Harrison’s comeback started began when North Cobb’s Taylor Parrish was called for a double-hit while setting the ball on back-to-back points. That’s when things started falling apart. The Lady Warriors committed a hitting error on the following point and Harrison’s Meg Kastensmidt followed with back-to-back kills on free balls. North Cobb committed another hitting error, followed by a miscue on serve-receive and allowed Harrison to close the gap to 23-22. The Lady Hoyas then closed their marathon service run with three straight kills. “We’ve been doing a lot of drills in the gym lately, just practicing coming back from being deficits like that,” Doering said. “I think those drills really helped. We weren’t trying to hype it up like it was a huge game, but we were thinking about it as if it were practice.” North Cobb coach James Auld called timeout twice during Harrison’s run, in an attempt to stop the bleeding.“It’s very difficult to rebound when you have a (23-14) first-set lead and you’re playing well,” Auld said. “Maybe we let up mentally, I don’t know, but we stopped doing the things that got us there. We started having passes that went over the net, we got (double-hit errors) and we had four unforced errors. “And a team like Harrison, with the skilled players that they have, all they need is an opening.” Once North Cobb gave Harrison that opening, it couldn’t shut the door.Harrison’s back-row defense stepped up to thwart North Cobb’s aggressive serving and attacks, which allowed the Lady Hoyas’ offense to get in sync. Harrison rattled off eight straight points to set the tone in the second set after the Lady Warriors jumped out to a 3-0 lead.Allana McInnis had 10 kills for Harrison, while Riley Fischer contributed with seven kills and two aces. Doering added two solo blocks and Kaylee Morris ended up with 32 assists.“That shifted the momentum, after we won the first set,” Harrison assistant coach Rob Cowart said. “It kind of took the wind out of their sails. We also had a lot more energy than we had in the previous match against them. In the third set, North Cobb stormed out to a 5-0 lead, only to see it evaporate. Once the Lady Hoyas took a 12-11 lead, they never lost it. Harrison a couple of small service runs, and the Lady Warriors couldn’t keep up. Parrish totaled 17 assists, while she and Hannah Lubert each had five kills. Jenna Woodruff led North Cobb with 12 kills.
