(Katherine Frey/The Washington Post) \nBy the time the Washington Capitals trotted onto the ice for Sunday’s preseason finale, the organization was “probably 90 percent on decisions” for what the roster will be in the regular-season premiere, Coach Barry Trotz said. The deadline for the opening day playing roster is 5 p.m. Tuesday. \nCenter Chandler Stephenson was cut before the game , potentially clearing the way for veteran Derek Roy, with the team on a professional tryout contract , to sign by Tuesday. Trotz said Stephenson is “almost there” and the growth he made in the last year should be a significant accomplishment to him. \nRoy didn’t play against the New York Islanders on Sunday. Stephenson starting the season in Hershey doesn’t guarantee Roy will be on the team, as the Capitals have other options for the vacant fourth-line center position, namely Michael Latta or Brooks Laich. Trotz said the decision on Roy will be “a joint one.” \n“We want to be quite honest and we want to know where we are as a team and also have the right role for Derek,” Trotz said. “That’s really important for us, too, and for Derek. We’ve talked about that organizationally as well.” \nTrotz got a last look at Liam O’Brien and Sean Collins, both vying with Stanislav Galiev for a depth forward position. Galiev has longer odds to make the team than O’Brien and Collins because unlike those two, Galiev would see first-line minutes in the American Hockey League, which the coaching staff may see as being more valuable than playing on the fourth line in the NHL. \nO’Brien beat long odds a year ago and made the team as an undrafted rookie free agent , but this year, it was Collins that Trotz considered the “surprise.” \n“They both were good,” Trotz said. “I’m really happy with where Liam has come from. He was a pretty good story last year. His skating and ability to play the game at a quicker level, he’s done a lot of good work, which I’m really excited about. \n“Then Sean came in here, and not knowing much about him, he’s done a good job. He’s not going to wow you as a sexy player or anything like that, he’s going to wow you with his consistency and he does a lot of does detail things that we know Joel Ward used to do here for many years that probably didn’t get noticed a lot until we started watching real closely. So I’m real happy with Sean’s camp.” \nAnother battle is for who will be the backup goaltender to Braden Holtby, a competition between Philipp Grubauer and Justin Peters. Both require waivers, and Peters may be less of a risk to get claimed because he is six years older than Grubauer. When Holtby fell ill and had to miss a game in the Capitals’ first-round playoff series, Washington turned to Grubauer, not Peters, to start in net. \nWashington is also deciding between Taylor Chorney, Ryan Stanton and Aaron Ness for who will be the team’s seventh defenseman. Chorney was the only one of those three to play the last two exhibition games, and Trotz said he’s been pleased with how he’s played this preseason. \n“As he’s gotten more used to the way we play, I think it’s helped his confidence,” Trotz said. “I think he’s had a plethora of people to play with.” Isabelle Khurshudyan covers the Washington Capitals.
