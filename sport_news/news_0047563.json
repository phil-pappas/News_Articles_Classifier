Olpe routs Remington to open district play By Emily Giffin Special to the Gazette emporiagazette.com | 0 comments \nOLPE — The coin toss wasn’t the only win chalked up by the Olpe in its homecoming game against Remington Friday night. After dominating the first half against the Broncos, the Olpe Eagles found their way to a 68-29 victory to open district play. \n“I’m proud of the kids, especially the ones who had to step up when we had injuries tonight because that’s something we’ve been working on with them,” said Olpe head coach Chris Schmidt. \nA strong showing in the first quarter set the tone for the first half as Damon Schmidt became the first Eagle to score followed quickly by the extra point, giving Olpe an early 7-0 lead. \nShortly after regaining possession of the ball on downs, a 9-yard run by Dylan Redeker extended Olpe’s lead to 13-0. \nRemington was denied an opportunity to score when Ethan Moyer recovered a fumble, once again giving the possession to the Eagles. \nWith less than two minutes remaining in the first quarter, Redeker scored yet again, and this time, a two-point conversion was successful, increasing Olpe’s lead even further. At the end of the first quarter, the Eagles had scored 21 unanswered points. \n“I was kind of surprised because [Remington] has played some tough competition, but we did some good things that gave us the upper hand,” Schmidt said. \nThe second quarter saw a similar showing from the home team, beginning with a 70-yard touchdown run by Brady Scheidegger after intercepting a Remington pass. \nOnce more, Olpe regained possession of the ball on downs and Redeker ran for his third touchdown of the game, putting the Eagles up 37-0. \nOn the next kickoff, Olpe recovered a fumble, which allowed Redeker to reach the end zone yet again. Two more touchdowns courtesy of Redeker left Olpe with a 50-0 lead going into halftime. \n“We’ve been pretty fortunate with this group,” Schmidt said. \nNathan Rhodes was the first Eagle to score in the second half as he ran for a touchdown, extending the lead to 56-0. \nRemington would not be shut down just yet, though. Paul Claassen was the first Bronco to score on the night. \nOlpe quickly answered the Broncos touchdown as Jake Smith ran for his first touchdown of the game, making the score 56-7 in favor of the Eagles to end the third quarter. \nNot to be outdone, the Broncos scored almost immediately on a 59-yard run by Jarret Sommers, putting Remington on the scoreboard for the second time. \nThe Eagles were able to answer with a 63-yard run by Smith that would be the last points on the board for Olpe before the end of the game. \n“We did some good things tonight, and I hope that those carry into our next game,” Schmidt said. \nOlpe, now 3-2, travels to take on Oswego next week. \nRemington 0 0 7 22 — 29 \nOlpe 21 29 12 6 — 68", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T10:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T01:47:38.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
