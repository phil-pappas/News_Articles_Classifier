They threatened to gherao ministers and Akali MLAs, if the deadline was not met. The gathering demanded that the guilty of sacrilege be identified at the earliest and action initiated against the officers involved in the firing incident that resulted in the death of two youths on October 14. Over 70 religious preachers, leaders and representatives of various panthic organisations had finalised a draft that was presented before the gathering on the bhog of deceased Sikh protesters Bhagwan Krishan Singh and Gurjeet Singh. No representative from the Sant Samaj was present on the occasion. Sikh sangat was asked to participate in “Sarbat Khalsa” to be held in Amritsar on November 10. In a special message, Panj Pyaras of the Akal Takht asked Sikhs to get together for the common cause. Bhai Malkeet Singh read out their message to the audience. Reading out the first resolution, Baljit Singh Daduwal said Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal was corrupt and “thirsty for the blood of his own community”. “Ranjit Singh Dhadrian Wale, Daler Singh Kheriwale, Panthpreet Singh Daduwal and Amrik Singh Ajnala will leave for the CM’s resident from Gurdwara Fatehgarh Sahib on October 30 so that they could present him their blood to quench his thirst,” he said. In another resolution, Punjabis have been asked to organise peaceful protests on November 3 from 12 noon to 3 pm. They have been asked to line up on both sides of the roads holding black flags all over the state during that period. Sikhs have been asked to participate in the protest without disturbing the traffic. They have also been asked to observe “Black Diwali” this year. The gathering sought the release of all political prisoners, including Rupinder Singh and Jaswinder Singh of Punjgrain Khurd who were arrested by the Faridkot police on the charge of bir desecration. Another resolution demanded SGPC elections at the earliest. The elections have been pending because a case is sub judice in the Supreme Court.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:11:19.977+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
