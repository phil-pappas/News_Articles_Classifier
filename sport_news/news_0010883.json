The injuy forced him from the game for his final at-bat and prompted the Jays to take him in for precautionary x-rays; they came back negative.\n“He’s been battling this thing,” Jays manager John Gibbons said. “It swelled up a little more than we’ve seen in the past. He did that early in the game. Usually it’s a day or two and it calms down and he’s able to get through it, so we’ll see. Hopefully he’ll be ready to go.”\nIt marks the second straight post-season Game 1 the Jays have lost, defeated by the Rangers at home in the ALDS. It also signals a four-game playoff losing streak against the Royals dating back to Game 4 of the 1985 ALCS, which was also the first seven game championship series in history.\nThe Royals struck first on Friday night, as they showed patience and attacked Marco Estrada’s pitches in the strike zone with short, line-drive strokes, scoring a pair in the third inning on doubles by Alex Gordon leading off, and Alcides Escobar, his second two-base hit of the game. With two outs, Lorenzo Cain spun his wrists into a fastball and lined a single between first and second into right field.\nThe single by Cain lengthened his post-season hitting streak to 10 games, second longest in Royals history. Against Estrada in the bottom of the fourth, catcher Sal Perez crushed a home run to left field over a leaping Ben Revere at the fence. It was his third homer of the post-season.\n“He was pretty good,” Gibbons said of Estrada’s second start of the playoffs. “They battled him up top. Escobar got a big double down that first base line and Cain had a good at-bat there. Overall, he didn’t give up a lot of hits, so early on I thought he was especially sharp. He knows how to survive, but he kept us in the game. We just got shut down, really.”\nEstrada was a little more critical in his self-evaluation pitching 5 1/3 innings, allowing three runs on six hits, with no walks and six strikeouts.\n“To be honest with you, I wasn’t really locating my fastball today,” Estrada said. “I got away with a few changeups I left up. Overall my off-speed stuff was there today, but I couldn’t control the fastball. I don’t know why. I had trouble holding on to that ball I guess. You can’t come in throwing balls with your fastball. You’ve got to be able to locate that pitch. And I just didn’t have it today. I’ll just work on it in the ’pen and it’ll be ready to go the next time.”\nMeanwhile, Volquez cruised through the first three innings, allowing just two base-runners on a pair of walks. With two outs in the fourth, Chris Colabello collected the first Jays hit of the night on a groundball into centre field.\nThe Jays had a huge opportunity to get back into the game in the sixth. Josh Donaldson and Jose Bautista worked Volquez for grinding bases-on-balls leading off. He ended up throwing 37 of his 111 pitches in that one inning, but Colabello lined a ball hard to left and Troy Tulowitzki took a called third strike to end the inning, both on full counts. Volquez was gone after six.\nIt was a homecoming of sorts for Gibbons, even though it was not exactly a case of Gibbons managing against his mentor — more like a close friend. Royals manager Ned Yost hired Gibbons when he was out of work after being fired by the Jays. He remained the bench coach for the Royals for three years (2009-11) when he thought he might never get back to the major leagues.\n“Ned took good care of me,” Gibbons said prior to Game 1. “I loved my time here. Really, we’re a lot alike. We have a lot of the same values, we do a lot of things the same way. We take the same criticism a lot of times. We’re both here.”\nAs for Gibbons, he would prefer not to have to duplicate the heroics of the ALDS when they rebounded from two games down. The Jays need starting ace David Price to come up big in Game 2 on Saturday before the series shifts back to the Rogers Centre.\nMore on thestar.com\nBlue Jays bats need to snap out of offensive funk to get back into ALCS: DiManno\nFive moments that mattered from Blue Jays’ loss in Game 1 of ALCS", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:17:07.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
