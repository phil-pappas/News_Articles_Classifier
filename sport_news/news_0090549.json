What’s not clear is how big this problem is. At issue is Engage New York. That’s a math curriculum the district started using last year as it aims to prepare students for the more rigorous state standards known as Common Core. A group of parents told the Baker School Board Tuesday night that Engage New York is failing their children. The parents say the curriculum is frustrating them and their children. Math is a vital subject in our high-tech era, and the school district has an obligation to ensure that it employs an effective curriculum. But here’s the rub: We know that Engage New York doesn’t work for some students and parents. We also know that it does work for others. What we don’t know is how many are in the former camp, and how many in the latter. Moreover, we don’t know — and neither, based on Tuesday’s meeting, does the school board know — what the district’s teaching staff thinks about this curriculum. Board members need as much information as can be gathered in a reasonable time before deciding whether to recommend changes in the math curriculum. The district should poll the teachers, and give parents a chance to comment, possibly by sending a questionnaire home with students. The situation in one classroom, or one grade level, might well be different from another. In any case it would be imprudent to simply scrap a curriculum that might be benefiting a significant percentage of Baker students. To their credit, some of the parents who addressed the board Tuesday said they want teachers to be able to use materials other than Engage New York. That’s a reasonable request. Teachers, after all, inevitably use a variety of techniques, since each student learns differently. But flexibility in the classroom must have limits. We can’t expect teachers with 25 students to simultaneously use two separate, and possibly quite different, strategies to teach math. And even if the district does away with Engage New York, its replacement likely will use conceptual tactics rather than the more traditional, memory-based ones many of us are familiar with. Ultimately, we doubt there’s a perfect, or simple, solution to this problem. But of course there is no curriculum, in math or any other subject, that’s perfect for a district of 1,600 students. The school board’s and the district’s challenge — and it’s a daunting one — is to find the best among the flawed options. We define “best” in this case as the option that gives the most students the best chance to learn the math skills many of them will need to succeed in college and career.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:10:13.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
