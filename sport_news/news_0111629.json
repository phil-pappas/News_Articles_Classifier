If Pittsburgh Steelers tailback DeAngelo Williams wants to honor his late mother with the color pink outside the month of October, he will have to do so without the color on his gear.\nWilliams lost his mother, Sandra Hill, to breast cancer in May 2014. The league honors breast cancer awareness month with pink playing gear in October, but Williams was told over the phone by NFL vice president of football operations Troy Vincent that he couldn't wear pink accessories throughout the season, according to an ESPN report. The league has maintained that there are no exceptions to the uniform policy, Williams told ESPN.\nBrett Carlsen/Getty Images The NFL goes pink for Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October.\nTo honor his mother on Monday night, Williams dyed the tips of his hair pink. He wanted to wear pink wristbands and shoes throughout the season.\n\"The same way it made you feel after you heard it - like, man,\" Williams told ESPN. \"He told me no. I'm assuming they are telling everybody else no as well. ... It wasn't about selling it. You know and I know and everybody else knows before I made the phone call.\"\nIn another display of support for those battling breast cancer, Williams will purchase 53 mammograms tests - in honor of his mother's age when she died - for a hospital in Charlotte, where he played nine seasons for the Panthers, and in Pittsburgh.\nRelated Stories Le'Veon Bell scores on direct snap to give Steelers win Cop sorry for asking Cowboys RB for pic during traffic stop NFL admits game officials should've noticed clock error Tags: deangelo williams", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:41:52.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
