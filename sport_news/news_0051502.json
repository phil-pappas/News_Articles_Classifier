It is also likely to be raised at a meeting of UEFA's 54 member associations which has been called for next Thursday in Nyon, Switzerland - UEFA president Platini filed his nomination papers to run for the presidency just hours before his suspension and postponing the election would help his cause. \nD'Hooghe, the longest-serving member of the FIFA ExCo, told Press Association Sport: \"I am one of the members asking for an emergency meeting of the FIFA ExCo. At the moment I have no information about an eventual postponing of the election but perhaps this point could be discussed there.\" \nThe deadline for nominations for candidates for the FIFA presidency is due to end on October 26. Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan is also planning to run, and it is understood Asian football chief Sheikh Salman Bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa from Bahrain is pondering whether to run himself, as is Kuwait's Sheikh Ahmad Al Fahad Al Sabah, another FIFA ExCo member. \nPlatini has insisted he is determined to maintain his challenge for the FIFA presidency but the ethics committee provisional ban stands in his way - and he will also have to pass an ethics committee integrity check. \nThe Frenchman has lodged an appeal against the ban, as has Blatter, who was relieved of his duties as FIFA president on Thursday. \nKlaus Stohlker, Blatter's friend and adviser, told Press Association Sport: \"He has appealed already to FIFA's appeal committee. He is defending his position and he is sure that he will be found not guilty.\" \nPlatini has also announced he will challenge the ban, and both cases will now go to the FIFA appeals committee. \nFootball Association chairman Greg Dyke has said the governing body will drop its support for Platini if the ethics committee decides there has been wrongdoing. \nScottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan said any move for UEFA nations to back calls for a postponement of the election would have to be carefully considered. \nHe said: \"We need to discuss this in more detail and understand the timeline and implications for those involved including Mr Platini - only then would we be able to make a balanced judgement.\" \nUEFA said Platini ''will not perform his official duties for the time being''. \nHe did not attend the meeting of the UEFA executive committee on Thursday and has cancelled several official trips.
