The senior missed the last five games after hurting his hamstring. \nThe Gophers, who host Nebraska, have been hit hard by injuries this season, particularly in the secondary. Cornerback Briean Boddy-Calhoun will probably miss his third straight game because of a knee problem. \nThe offensive line has been thinned, too. Center Brian Bobek and right tackle Josh Campion will likely still be out with their injuries. Joe Bjorklund and Jon Christenson shared time at left guard last week, but both players are battling knee injuries themselves. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:43:21.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
