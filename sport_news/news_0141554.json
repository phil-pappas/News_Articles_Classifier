The losses dropped Durango to 3-15 overall and 1-6 in the 4A/5A Southwestern League, which places them in fifth. Montrose is now 9-8 overall and 4-4 in league. In the first game, the Demons got off to a slow start giving up 10 runs in the first inning. Durango was unable to bounce back from a tough first inning, and the game was called after five innings of play. DHS senior Cami Bisbee got the start in the circle and finished the day with one strikeout while giving up 13 hits. “If you take away that first inning, we would’ve won the game,” Durango head coach Chelsea Rodriguez said in a phone interview with The Durango Herald. “After the first inning, we were fighting back from there and couldn’t get the upper hand. One bad inning can really break a game for you.” For the Demons, junior Katrina Chandler gave Durango a spark by going 2-for-3 with an inside-the-park home run in the third inning. Freshman Alexyss Unruh went 2-for-3 with one run batted in, sophomore Joie Raybourn went 1-for-3 with two RBIs. Durango finished the first game with nine hits. In the second game, the Demons came around and played more competitively. However, it was not enough. Heading into the seventh inning, Durango led Montrose, 12-10, but mental errors gave the game away, and the Indians scored four runs in the final inning for the win. Durango didn’t help itself, racking up six errors in the game. Bisbee got the call in the circle once more and struck out two batters and allowed 20 hits. “(Bisbee) threw incredibly well, but we had a lot of errors,” Rodriguez said. “(Montrose) had some lucky bounces in that went their way.” The Durango Demons will finish their season off against Montezuma-Cortez at 5 p.m. Oct. 6 at home. The Demons previously beat the Panthers 8-7 on Sept. 15 in Cortez.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T09:32:41.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
