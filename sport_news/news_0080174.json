North Ave.\nAccording to River Forest police, an employe at Shell found the device at 3:34 p.m. Oct. 13 while changing out the receipt paper at one of the gas pumps.\n\"We don't have much information as far as anyone's accounts that have been compromised,\" said River Forest Deputy Chief Jim O'Shea. \"We are working with the Secret Service.\"\nO'Shea said the device was actually found inside the gas pump, and is not the type of skimming device typically found near the credit card port.\n\"A lot of devices like this go over the credit card insert,\" O'Shea said. \"This one was a little more advanced. It was connected inside the machine. It actually plugged into the computer of the gas pump. This is something that's within the machine that's grabbing the information electronically.\"\nCustomers who have recently used a gas pump at the Shell station are encouraged to monitor their bank accounts and credit card information.\n\"We definitely ask them to call their banks and credit card company,\" O'Shea said.\nsschering@pioneerlocal.com\nTwitter: @steveschering\nCopyright Â© 2015, Chicago Tribune U.S. Secret Service", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5625367e/turbine/ct-rfl-credit-card-skimmer-tl-1022-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-19T21:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:59:45.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
