Smith to Kevin Durant: You don't want me as an enemy Comment By Kyle Newport, Bleacher Report   Kyle Newport, Bleacher Report Posted Oct. 5, 2015 at 1:19 PM By Kyle Newport, Bleacher Report Posted Oct. 5, 2015 at 1:19 PM After seeing Kevin Durant shoot down his report and call him a liar, ESPN's Stephen A. Smith responded to the Oklahoma City Thunder superstar on First Take on Monday morning. He's not backing down. Last week, Smith reported on First Take that the Los Angeles Lakers are a team Durant will consider when he hits free agency next summer. Durant didn't hold back when denying that report Friday, via Anthony Slater of the Oklahoman: \"Kevin Durant on the Lakers rumors: 'I don't talk to Stephen A Smith at all. No one in my family, my friends do. So he's lying.'\" Smith responded a short time later on Twitter. However, the outspoken reporter wasn't done addressing the matter. On Monday's show, Smith talked in-depth about the matter. Although he repeatedly complimented the Thunder forward, he had some bold things to say. Not only did Smith say Durant is the one who is \"lying,\" but he also said, via @ Joshmaniii , that Durant should be careful about going after him. Neither Smith nor Durant is afraid to speak his mind. Knowing that, this drama is probably far from over.
