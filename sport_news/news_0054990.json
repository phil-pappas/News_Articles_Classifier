Donaldson's helmet flew off as his head hit the inside of Odor's left leg.\nThe Toronto third baseman stayed down on the ground for a few seconds before walking off under his own power. He returned to the dugout but was later removed from the game as a precaution, a team spokesman said.\nOdor, who was not hurt, didn't bother with a throw to first. Ben Revere moved to third base on the play and later scored on an infield single by Edwin Encarnacion, giving Toronto its first run of the game.\nEzequiel Carrera replaced Donaldson in the No. 2 spot in the order but grounded out in his lone at-bat. Utility infielder Cliff Pennington later replaced Carrera at third base.\nDonaldson, a top contender for the American League's most valuable player award, batted .297 this past season with 41 homers and 123 RBIs.\nThe Rangers also lost one of their star players earlier in the game. Adrian Beltre left in the third inning due to lower back stiffness.\nThere was no immediate word on the status of either player for Game 2 in the best-of-five series on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:22:05.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
