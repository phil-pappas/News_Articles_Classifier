(AP Photo/Tony Ding) \nMichigan State defensive back Jalen Watts-Jackson has had hip surgery a day after scoring the winning touchdown on the final play against Michigan. \nThe surgery at the University of Michigan hospital Sunday lasted more than three hours. \nWatts-Jackson was in the right place to catch a floating football that Wolverines punter Blake O'Neill fumbled Saturday. He returned it 38 yards to lift the Spartans to a startling 27-23 victory. \nHe didn't have much chance to celebrate. The redshirt freshman appeared to land hard on his left hip after he was tackled into the end zone by Michigan tight end Jake Butt. \nJoyous teammates jumped on Watts-Jackson as he lay on a maize \"M'' in the end zone. He was carted off the field and hospitalized. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:33:16.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
