The winner also earns a berth to the provincial championship in Winnipeg in February. \nFor Murray Warren, who’s playing with Brian Barker, Terry Warren and Reg Warren, earning that berth is something in the back of his mind but it isn’t the main reason he’s coming to Brandon to play. \n“You think about it but we enter in it every year anyway,” said Murray \nThis bonspiel is an annual tradition for the 60-year-old. He’s been in every event since it started as a 30-team men’s competition in 1998. Then known as the Guild October Classic, the event added a seniors division in 2002. It became strictly a seniors event 10 years ago. Warren won the men’s title in 2002 and climbed to the top of the field in 2011. \nHis team had a decent run last year as well by reaching the final before falling to Terry McNamee, Rob Van Kommer, Todd Witherspoon and Ian Scott. Warren would love to get back there this year and earn a third championship. \n“It would be nice to, but we’ll have to see how it goes. We don’t get to that all the time,” he said. \nThe teams will be in four pools of four with the top two from each advancing to Sunday’s playoffs. Warren’s pool includes Carl German, Russell Shackel and Frank Gudz. He opens play against German on Friday at 4 p.m. The first draw of the event is at 1 p.m. The final is set for Sunday at 4 p.m. \nWarren knows his team has to come out firing to have success this weekend, and they’ve been trying to prepare for the event. All four players on his senior team have tried to get to the Brandon club to practise in the last week. Murray and Reg also got a game under their belt on that ice yesterday courtesy of the Westoba Credit Union Masters Super League. \nWith small pools, there’s not a lot of room for error early in the bonspiel, but Warren is looking forward to getting back on the ice and getting this season under way. \n“It will be tough. We’ll have to curl good and have some good fortune with it,” he said. \nEXTRA ENDS: The Westman Junior Super League is looking for one more team. League games will be played on Saturdays and Sundays.
