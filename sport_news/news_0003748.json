United on Sunday. \nThe Crew secured a first-round playoff bye and a spot in the East semifinals. \nIt was the most lopsided victory for Columbus since a 6-1 win over Tampa Bay during the 2001 season. \nUnited could have claimed a first-round bye by beating a Columbus side playing without two players. Kei Kamara, the MLS leader in goals scored, and Federico Higuain both were suspended for the finale due to an accumulation of yellow cards. \nColumbus led 1-0 at halftime and broke it open in the second half. Justin Meram scored in the 54th minute to make it 2-0, and Aaron Schoenfeld tallied in the 80th.
