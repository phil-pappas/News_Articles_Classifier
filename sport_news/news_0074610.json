Val Johnson fired away at the net offensively, and Hanna Schultz flashed some defensive finesse, turning a handful of blocked shots into key points. The Exeter High School volleyball team never found its peak game on Wednesday night. Thankfully, it had its three standout middles to lean on. Senior outside hitter Lex Campbell led the attack with 11 kills, Johnson, a junior, chipped in an efficient seven and the Blue Hawks fought off Keene in four games, pushing their Division I record to 8-6. Keene dropped to 2-11. The Blackbirds stole the first set, 27-25, and were threatening to push the match to five after rallying for a 17-15 lead in Game 4. “We need to do more,” Exeter coach Mike McDonnell said. “Listen, I’m not taking anything away from Keene. That libero was really good. Their defense was pretty good. I thought they played very well. I just think we need to play better.” The Blue Hawks took the second set, 25-18, and left no doubt in Game 3, running away with with a 25-8 decision. But they had to refocus in Game 4 after surrendering a once comfortable lead. They tied that game, 17-17, on a kill by Schultz and an ace from senior Chelsea deRochemont. Later, a big block by Johnson and kills from Campbell and Sophia Scola gave Exeter a 23-20 edge. The Hawks closed out a 25-22 win for the match moments later, getting the clincher when Schultz went up for the block and tipped the ball over the net in one motion. “We’re a very strong team,” Johnson said. “We just have to show it.” It’s been an up-and-down year for the Hawks, who opened with four straight losses and came back with six straight wins. They’re 8-2 over their last 10 matches, getting a boost from juniors Johnson, Scola, Bousquin and Jessica Peirce. “Val’s really coming into her own right now,” McDonnell said of Johnson. “She’s really having kind of a breakthrough in practice and it’s really starting to show in games now. That’s great for us.” She’s given the team a reliable middle hitter to complement Campbell on the outside. Scola has been another great story for the team, coming back from a concussion that limited her playing time last season and blossoming as a team leader. “I enjoy the pressure, Scola said. “I like being out there on the court working with my team.” “When we find her she tends to put the ball in, and she puts the ball in with some power,” McDonnell said of Scola, “so it makes a difference. Defensively, she’s really given us a boost in the back row.” The Blue Hawks kept Keene at bay in the second set, moving to game point on another block-kill by Schultz. Exeter had a visible size advantage at the net, and it exploited that during its 17-point win in Game 3. When things started to turn south in Game 4, it was Bousquin who stepped on the court and implored the team from the front row. “She’s got great voice out there,” McDonnell said. “She’ll pick the team up often times.” Exeter has climbed into a share for ninth in the Division I standings. It hosts a Manchester Memorial team on Friday that hasn’t won a match in its last nine tries. “I think we didn’t start out strong enough,” Johnson said. “We didn’t play as well as we could have. We definitely came back, obviously, but we just need to go back to basics. What works best for us is playing games to five, and we didn’t do that tonight.” By Ryan O’Leary", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:38:28.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
