A drunken motorist hit and killed a Brooklyn father who stopped on his way home from work yesterday to help a fellow limo driver, police said.\nRafael Rafailov, 50, died on the Prospect Expressway in Kensington, knocked out of his shoes by the impact. He was just minutes from his Sheepshead Bay home.\n\"He was the most giving person,\" said one of Rafailov's three grown daughters, Regina Rafailov, 22, as she struggled to keep her composure.\n\"That's why he got out of the car to help another man. He was so good, always trying to help others. He was on his way home. He was right there,\" she said.\nInvestigators said Rafailov was driving near Ocean Parkway and Church Ave. about 1:20 a.m. when he saw another Lincoln Town Car stalled in the middle lane of the expressway and stopped to help.\nRafailov was connecting jumper cables to the other car's battery when a speeding Toyota Camry slammed into the two limos and then hit a Honda Odyssey minivan that had stopped for a red light.\nRafailov died on the spot.\n\"There was a loud crash,\" said a shaken Alex Berg, 27, who witnessed the accident. \"The guy was hit so hard his shoes came off.\"\nHe said the Camry was \"doing at least 80.\"\nThe careening Camry then slammed into the minivan, forcing it across the wide intersection, witnesses said.\nLeonid Ladykow, 50, the other limo driver, and the minivan operator, described only as a 44-year-old man, suffered minor injuries.\nRafael Rafailov Police arrested the Toyota driver, Alexey Bushuyev, 22, of Brooklyn, and charged him with manslaughter, criminally negligent homicide and driving while intoxicated. Bushuyev, who cops said blew a .11 on the Breathalyzer, also suffered only minor injuries.\n\"They arrested the guy, but now what? I don't want anything from this,\" said Regina Rafailov.\nShe said her dad's death had also hit her mother, Tamara, very hard.\n\"He always called when he was on long trips,\" Regina said. But when her father failed to come home as usual at 1 a.m. and there was no call, she said her mother knew something was wrong.\nShe said her parents, married for 26 years, had planned to start looking for a bigger home today.\nRafailov and Ladykow have driven for Brooklyn-based Concord Limousines for 12 years, said company representative Dorothy Santero, 41.\nShe said Ladykow \"feels responsible. He is distraught and very shaken up.\"\nRafailov, she said, \"was very polite, cordial and worked hard. One of our corporate clients, a CEO, always requested his services even though he didn't drive one of the newer cars.\"\n\"He was of that caliber.\"\nenaspretto@nydailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:11:53.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
