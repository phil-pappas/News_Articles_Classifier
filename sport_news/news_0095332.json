Senior setter Maddie Mueller had 26 assists in the win. Sophomore Kaleigh Breathitt had 21 digs and two aces, while Mack added two aces of her own. Springdale went on several long service runs with Breathitt, Mack and senior Kaylee Gaston. \n\"I like Kaylee Gaston serving; she does a good job for us,\" Springdale coach Kylie Moad said. \"(Breathitt) missed one that first game, then she was very consistent.\" \nThe Lady Bulldogs trailed 20-16 in the opening set before running off nine straight points to earn the 25-20 win. They won the first game at Northside before losing three straight, but that wasn't the case Thursday. \nThe Lady Bulldogs took the commanding 2-0 lead with a tight 25-23 win in game two, a set clinched by a Mack kill after neither team was able to gain much separation throughout. Springdale and Mack were able to make plays, while Northside struggled down the stretch. \n\"We're still really working hard on our serve-receive,\" Northside coach Matt Waack said. \"That's our main struggle -- 90 percent of our passes are outside of the 10-foot line. We rate all serve-receive balls on a three scale. Three's perfect, two's workable and one's not so good. When we pass in the low ones like we did tonight, there's no way we're going to be successful. We can't use all of our offense.\" \nSpringdale jumped out to an 18-11 lead in game three and then weathered a rally as Northside (1-13 conference) cut it to 19-16. The Lady Bulldogs held on for the 25-18 win clinched by another Mack kill. \nAlexa Scott led Northside with nine kills, while Chloe Fitzgerald had six and Madison Shrum five. \nSpringdale will wrap up its season at Springdale Har-Ber on Tuesday. \nSports on 10/16/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:08:10.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
