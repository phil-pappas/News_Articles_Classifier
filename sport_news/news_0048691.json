New Jersey isn’t just cutting crime across the state — it’s reducing the number of people behind bars, too.\nThe state’s prison population — down a staggering 26% since 2000 — dwindled 9.5% between 2011 and 2014 — the second highest reduction behind Mississippi, according to a new report.\nJust as incarceration has been on the decline over the last decade and a half, so too have crimes across New Jersey. During the same period, crime fell by about 30%, according to the report by NYU's Brennan Center for Justice .\n“New Jersey has dramatically reduced its prison population, and New Jersey has been able to do this while also dramatically reducing its crime rate,” said Lauren-Brooke Eisen, a co-author of the report.\n“It's very telling because it shows that you can decrease incarceration while also decreasing crime, and much of that was purposeful.”\nThe report, which tracked incarceration and crime rates in all 50 states, is proposing a policy that would offer financial incentives to states that reduce their prison populations by 7% over a three-year period, provided that crime does not substantially go up.\nRich Pedroncelli/AP The report proposed a policy that would offer financial incentives to states that reduce their prison populations by 7% over a three-year period. Eisen explained that up until now, the federal government has endowed states with financial rewards for increasing prison populations, but that stemmed from a time when crime rates were skyrocketing, which is no longer the case.\n“We're hoping that this policy proposal is taken up by congress or a presidential candidate, and really, it's this sort of antidote to a lot of the federal grants in the past that have incentivized a growth in incarceration,” she said.\n“The idea here is, you know what, it's time to start rolling that back — you don't need lengthy sentences or prison at all in many situations.”\nEisen praised many of the reforms that New Jersey recently implemented that contributed to the major decline in its prison population — like making the parole process more efficient, increasing its use of drug courts as an alternative to incarceration and flexible sentencing for minor drug offenders.\nIn addition to New Jersey, New York also joined the ranks of a handful of states that have reduced its incarceration rate in recent years — New York's prison population diminished by 5% between 2011 and 2014, just as its crime rate plummeted by 11%, making it the state with the 12th largest reduction in prison populations, according to the report.\nEisen lauded New York for cutting incarceration in the last few years, but admitted the state still has a ways to go.\n“New York does invest a lot of money in incarceration and it certainly can get better. I think we need to start looking at its pre-trial practices and jail practices,” she said.\n“New York can do more in reducing its pre-trial population, in investing more alternative forms to incarceration, and reducing the amount of individuals who are sent to prison for low-level crimes.”\nSAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images New York saw the 12th largest reduction in its prison population between 2011 and 2014, but can improve in terms of its pre-trial population, according to the co-author of the report. With the U.S. making up 5% of the world's population and disproportionately, claims 25% of the world's prisoners, the report called for a 20% reduction in incarceration rates nationwide.\nAnd, contrary to the conviction that more incarceration is commensurate with less crime on the streets, the data in the report showed otherwise.\nNew Jersey, New York, California, Maryland and Texas — colossal states that Eisen said represent 30% of the U.S. population — all saw simultaneous crime and incarceration reductions.\n“What that tells us is that imprisonment can decrease while crime also continues to decrease,” she said.\n“That really shows that you don't need to increase incarceration to decrease crime.”\nbrobins@nydailynews.com", "external_links": ["https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/publications/The_Reverse_Mass_Incarceration_Act%20.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:21:08.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
