We expected them to throw the ball a lot more,” Saddleback Valley Christian coach Brendan Chambers said. “They had a great game plan. We made some adjustments at halftime and I give all the credit in the world to these coaches and players for battling through adversity.” \nThe first score of the game didn’t come until late in the first quarter, after CVC punter Ryan Rapattoni pinned the SVC offense down to the two-yard line. Cade Henjum was brought down by a host of Eagle defenders in the end zone for a safety to give CVC a 2-0 lead. \nOn the second possession of the second half, Henjum found Savaii Cravens on a 38-yard touchdown pass to give the Warriors a 6-2 lead. \nEarly in the fourth quarter, Henjum scrambled out of pressure and completed an 11-yard pass to David Molina in the back of the end zone. \nCVC answered on the ensuing possession. Daniel Herber threw a short touchdown pass to Ben Sukut . Herber found the endzone on a two-point conversion to cut the Warrior lead to three. \nOn the first play from scrimmage following the touchdown, Dalton Lohman fumbled and Nolan Kahal recovered the ball to give CVC the ball. \nSukut had a 36-yard touchdown run called back on a holding penalty and the Warrior defense caused a fumble at the two-yard line to seal the victory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:17:31.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
