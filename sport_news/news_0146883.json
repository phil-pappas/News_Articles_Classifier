(Courtesy) Shawn Byrne Miner Staff Reporter KINGMAN - Out of the pack in the midst of an internationally flavored slow-pitch softball tournament, the Kingman Senior Softball team placed second with a 6-3 record. KSS' win total included a 20-15 win over the eventual champions, The Hawaiians, at the LVSSA/SSUSA World Master Championships 2015 in Las Vegas Oct. 2-4.\"Everyone thinks this is beer league softball, but this is highly regulated,\" said KSS player/manager Dave Hawkins. \"We take pride in that all but two of us are from Kingman. We play squads that draw from pools of millions or at least hundreds of thousands of people.\"The first day of the 12-team tournament was seeding day, and KSS went 1-1 to earn the No. 6 seed for the double-elimination tournament. That was when Kingman beat The Hawaiians, but it lost to Ontario, Canada, 15-10.KSS opened bracket play with a pair of wins - 18-13 over Guam and 22-13 over Vancouver. KSS met up with The Hawaiians again, but this time the islanders got the edge, 14-9. KSS would have to get through the loser's bracket if it was going to win the championship.KSS opened Day 3 with a 14-11 win over Austin, Texas, Manifest. Kingman then exacted revenge on Ontario, eliminating it from the tournament, 22-16. KSS advanced to the championship games when it eliminated Texas' Romo's Old School, 12-11.Kingman ran into The Hawaiians yet one more time, and KSS had to beat them twice. That didn't work out as The Hawaiians took the championship, 18-8, but they did suffer that one loss to Kingman.\"We're pleased to promote the softball culture that has died off a bit in the last decade,\" Hawkins said. \"We might not run fast, but we can still hit the ball. It's entertaining.\"Armando Caban was team MVP and made the all-tournament team by batting .857, going 30-for-35. Marty Huggins (.730), Tomas Wilson (.657) and Glenn Jordan (.657) also made the all-tournament team for KSS.The rest of the Kingman roster included Bob Posey, Curtis Cutshaw, Mark Esquibel, Bill Wyatt, Jeff Pollard, Marty Harnisch, Mike Ross and Dennis Holland.Hawkins said this team would like to move up to the 55+ division and have another group of players compete in 50-plus.KSS returns to action in a tournament over the Halloween weekend in Bullhead City.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:16:44.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
