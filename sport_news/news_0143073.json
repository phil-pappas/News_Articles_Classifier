Two years ago, the Wildcats came up short in a championship bid and last year were four shots from qualifying from the MIAA Division III state championship. On Monday, the Wildcats erased both of those marks. \nDevyn Olds shared medalist honors with Turners Falls' Ryan Lenois with scores of 78, and the Wildcats earned a decisive victory over Monson to claim the 2015 Western Massachusetts Division III championship in the tournament at The Ranch in Southwick. The Wildcats finished with a score of 345 to Monson's 353. \n\"It feels fantastic,\" Olds said after his co-medalist round. \"I knew we were the underdog for this. We were feeling confident coming in today.\" \n\"This is truly amazing,\" freshman Thomas Fraser said. \"Our whole team did really good.\" \nFraser was an eighth grader on the Wildcat team that finished fifth a year ago. \nDefending champion Caleb Farnham of Hopkins Academy shot an 83 on Monday, five strokes behind Olds and Lenois. \nNeither of last year's state teams, champion Pioneer Valley and runner-up St. Mary's, qualified for the state tournament. \nSt. Joseph golfer Cody Tynan shot an 86 and his score was the cutoff to qualify for the state tournament. \nThe Wildcats and Tynan will head to Cape Cod next week for the state Division III tournament. The event will be held at the Cummaqiuid Golf Club in Yarmouth Port.

We have young kids coming up too,\" he said after the tournament. \"We're pretty happy. I'm happy for the kids. They deserve it.\" \nThe tournament itself started 90 minutes later than scheduled because overnight frost impacted the course. The 18 holes might have thawed out a bit, but the players ... well, that's another story. \n\"It was cold and tough conditions,\" said Carlino. \"There were higher scores because of the conditions. [The course] played tougher.\" \nWhile olds and freshman Thomas Fraser, one of the runners-up at last week's Berkshire Classic, both finished in the top five, it was a score at the back of the Lee board that helped propel the Wildcats to the Cape. \nWith two scores of 100 or better in the board, the Wildcats got a 90 from senior David Belanger, and that helped propel the Wildcats into the lead. \n\"I'm so happy for David,\" said Carlino. \"It's his senior year. He came through and sealed the deal for us.\" \nA year ago, Olds was fifth in the tournament at Franconia. The conditions were a bit better then and while the score may not have completely reflected the play, the Wildcat said he was happy with his performance. \n\"It was windy and cold. I was hitting really good shots all day,\" said Olds, who added he had only one three-putt all day. \"I didn't use the driver much. I was using my 4-iron [more].\" \nThe Wildcats will be accompanied to the Cape by St. Joe's Tynan, whose 86 earned him a spot in the state championship. \n\"I thought I hit the ball good\" Monday, he said after his round. \"I was in trouble a little more than I would have liked.\" \nTynan, like everyone else, had to adjust to grees that were hard and quick. He said the greens didn't hold too many of his shots. \n\"It was cold, but I'm pretty happy with my score,\" he said. \"Eighty-six in this weather, I'll take it.'' \nAs will the Wildcats, who got to bring home the gold trophy. \n\"Our whole season, we kept working as a team and we got better every match,\" said Fraser. \"I knew we had a shot at this.\" \n——— \nTeam totals 1.
