He then birdied the first three holes on the front nine and added birdies on 5 and 7 before a five-foot par save on his last hole for his best career round. Jin leads Gregory Foo of Singapore (64) and Nick Voke of New Zealand, who was among nearly 30 golfers who did not complete the first round because of the late start. Voke was at 6 under with one hole to complete today. Guan Tianlang of China, the 2012 champion, shot a 68.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:38:34.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
