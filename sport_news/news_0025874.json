The project, to be executed by the Jammu and Kashmir Forest Department, involves plantation of a wide variety of medicinal and fruit plants on 44,000 hectare of mountainous area. The Forest Department will undertake a large-scale plantation drive in the area visited by tourists in Pahalgam in the first phase. The Chief Minister stated that he had especially invited the Governor to be present at today’s inaugural plantation programme as the track to Chandanwari and beyond was the route to Amarnath. In his brief remarks, the Governor congratulated the Chief Minister for focusing attention on the need for afforestation. He suggested that a similar initiative could be launched on the Baltal axis, where the mountain ranges were relatively young and frequent landslides and mudslides were witnessed during summer. Stressing the need for careful selection of plant species as per ecology of the area, the Governor observed that flowering trees and shrubs should be planted on a very large scale. On account of the soil binding properties of juniper species, he suggested that the entire route beyond Baltal could be planted with juniper. The Governor appreciated the Chief Minister’s initiative to involve locals in this project, which had been conceived on the basis of public-private partnership. He highlighted the contribution of mountain people in preserving forests and preserving mountain culture, deeply rooted in their daily lives. Mufti spoke about the high attention which was being devoted to alleviate the economic status of mountain people and stressed the high importance of forestry for upgrading the lot of farming community. He referred to how the degradation of biodiversity adversely affected their lives and called for a strong joint effort by various stakeholders to make this new programme successful. Bali Bhagat, Minister for Forest, Environment and Ecology, spoke about the problems due to encroachment on forest areas and necessity of rehabilitation and conservation of forests to maintain ecological balance. The Governor, Chief Minister, Forest Minister and other dignitaries planted saplings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:12:02.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
