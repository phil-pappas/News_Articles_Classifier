We don't know who they were. We know they were young men roughly late teens early 20s and they were armed,\" Buffa's owner Jarret Rogers said.\nOn a Monday night, two men with guns robbed the restaurant and stole a wallet from one of the customers - a crime bearing strong similarities to the armed robberies at Patios, Atchafalaya Restaurant and Monkey Hill bar.\n\"On the outside, it sounds similar to these other incidents but I can't say anything for sure,\" Rogers said.\nNOPD has not said if any of the cases are related, but investigators admit the three Uptown robberies do have similarities.\nThe crimes are starting to tarnish New Orleans' tourism industry as word of the crimes is spreading nationally. On Thursday, a Washington Post article advised \"foodies\" to watch out, as upscale New Orleans restaurants become targets for criminals. Tourist are paying attention.\n\"This wouldn't happen where I'm from, no. I don't believe so,\" Connecticut tourist John Larochelle said.\nHe and his wife came to New Orleans last Thursday and he said the crime is making him think before he lets the good time roll.\n\"I don't know that it would have changed my plans because I wanted to see the city, but it makes you a little leery of the different establishments that you would go into,\" Larochelle said.\n\"It's hurting their business. They are aware customers are scared,\" Louisiana Eats host Poppy Tooker said.\nShe's fearful what it means if the criminals are not caught and continue to wreak havoc on patrons.\n\"This is going to hurt us more than any armed robbery on the street, more than incidents of crime in the French Quarter. This is going to kill the industry if it is not addressed immediately,\" she said.\nRestaurant owners address the problem as much as they can across the entire city.\n\"It's time to take any option away from them. They're not coming to Katie's,\" Katie's Restaurant owner Scott Craig said.\nThe popular Mid-City restaurant is now patrolled by an armed off-duty Orleans Parish sheriff's deputy.\n\"I've lived here all my life. I'm born and raised, and I've never seen anything like this my whole life,\" Craig said. \"They just seem to be fearless. and I don't want that to happen to my people and my customers.\"\nThere is a $7,500 reward for tips that lead to an arrest in the Buffa's armed robbery.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
