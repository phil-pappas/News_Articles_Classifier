Most Popular October 1, 2015 | 8:14 pm \nAMES — Playing spoiler is what Iowa State football has grown accustomed to. \nIn an air-raid dominant league like the Big 12, the Cyclones usually are left to catch up to what their counterparts in Oklahoma and Texas are doing with the best talent. It leaves Iowa State with an underdog approach and allows players to conjure up thoughts of disrespect. \nBut against Kansas, not only is Iowa State not the underdog, it is an overwhelming favorite at 16 points. It might be a role the Cyclones have grown accustomed to in this series, but proving it Saturday is as vital as it’s ever been. \n“When you’re expected to win, you’ve got the challenge of living up to that and delivering what everybody expects you to get accomplished,” ISU Coach Paul Rhoads said. \nIowa State has won four of the last five in the series and will be going for its first Big 12-opening win since 2002 — a 45-3 win against the Jayhawks. That lone loss was a 34-14 result last season in Lawrence, and served as the lowest of low points in the Cyclones’ two-win season. \nRhoads has preached to his players to bury the past and has simultaneously recognized the mental growth made throughout his team. On paper, Iowa State was the favorite in that game a year ago, but was outgained by 141 yards against a team that didn’t win any other Big 12 games. \n“Last year was a hard year for everyone,” said wide receiver Allen Lazard. “We walked off that field feeling like we left a lot on the field and we didn’t play to our potential at all that game. So we’ve just got to step up this week and get back to winning.” \nIowa State senior quarterback Sam Richardson will get his long-awaited start against Kansas after injuries held him out of the last two contests. His first meaningful snaps with the Cyclones came in 2012 when, in Lawrence, he relieved Steele Jantz and torched the Jayhawks, completing 23 of 27 passes for 250 yards and four touchdowns. \nRichardson is one of just five FBS quarterbacks with at least 5,000 passing yards (5,356) and 1,000 rushing yards (1,023), but has yet to win a conference game as a starter. It’s not something he dwells on, but does know the opportunity he’s been given on Saturday. \n“I don’t want to say we owe them one or anything after last year, but it’s just a game we’re looking forward to,” Richardson said. \nl Comments: montzdylan@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:41:29.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
