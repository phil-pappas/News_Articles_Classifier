The program has raised more than $5,000 in the past seven years. It was the second time this year that the team has raised $600 in a day, the first coming in Richard's Run for pediatric cancer earlier in the season.\nThe Highlanders won the \"Play for Pink\" game, 6-1, thanks to goals from five players, two from Gabby Pontone. Pontone has continued to be one of the most prolific scorers in the area, posting 22 goals and 10 assists.\nBOON IN GOAL: One talisman of Northern Highlands' torrid October has been backup goalie Quinn Slayne, who has stepped in and won all seven games in which she has played. Starter Victoria Marino is recovering from a concussion.\n\"Quinn has been a godsend to us,\" said coach Rich Smith. \"That streak includes quality [wins over] Pompton Lakes and Wayne Valley.\"\nPontone and Slayne arguably will be the most important individual components for Highlands' success in the coming games, especially the Bergen County final against Ramsey on Sunday.\n\"We're certainly going to have our hands full with Ramsey, but it should be a very competitive game,\" added Smith.\nUPSET OF THE YEAR: River Dell headed into a Monday clash against West Milford with just one win, but the Golden Hawks defeated a team firmly entrenched just below one of the North Jersey elite with a 2-1 victory.\nKim Lewis and Isabela Gladston scored for River Dell.\n\"The win was an exciting one,\" said coach Jessica Rickershauser. \"We had [a 1-0 loss to West Milford] early in the season, so we knew we could win if we gave ourselves the opportunity through our play.\"\nRiver Dell has been giving itself those types of opportunities all year, also losing one-goal games versus Pompton Lakes, at Lakeland, at Passaic Valley and versus Wayne Valley. The fact that Monday's win was River Dell's second does not do the Golden Hawks' justice. A break here and there would have put River Dell in the state tournament, so look for the Golden Hawks to be a dark horse in 2016.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:01:04.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
