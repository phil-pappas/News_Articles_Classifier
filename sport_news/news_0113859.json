Good news: There’s no reason to approach R&B singer Kelis Rogers’s new recipe collection, “My Life on a Plate,” with anything but respect. Ms. Rogers (who goes simply by the name of Kelis) possesses an acumen in the kitchen to match her confidence at the microphone. This should come as no surprise; her father was a jazz musician, her mother is a caterer, and the Harlem-raised native New Yorker has studied both disciplines with equal passion and rigor. In addition to cutting four albums, including last year’s aptly titled “Food,” she’s found time to graduate from Le Cordon Bleu and host “Saucy & Sweet,” a show on the Cooking Channel. A trained saucier, she claims she can “make a sauce out of anything,” and if you think she’s exaggerating, just take a look at the refrigerator at her home in Glendale, Calif., or at bountyandfull.com , where she sells her own line of sauces.\nWhether it’s the duck confit sliders she served from a food truck at the 2014 SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, or the cornbread with candied ginger she bakes for her 6-year-old son, Knight, Kelis likes to push the limits of flavor and her own creativity. “No matter how much I love something,” she said, “I can’t eat the same thing every day. I’m like, show me more.”\nRelated Recipe ENLARGE Laure Joliet for The Wall Street Journal Chocolate Chunk Cookies With Sea Salt Potato Chips The thing most people notice first about my kitchen is: my bright canary-yellow oven with gold knobs. It’s like a taxicab. It reminds me of New York. It’s a Lacanche. I customized it. It had to be done.\nThe best feature of my kitchen is: my dual refrigeration. The family fridge, a Kenmore Elite, has things like juice boxes, apple sauce, milk—for my son’s lunches. The other one, a Maxx Cold, has goose fat, vegetables—my work stuff. And, literally, buckets of sauce.\nThe kitchen tools I couldn’t live without are: my blenders. I’m a blender fiend. I have so many different kinds. And I think everyone should have a food processor. I probably have four blenders and three food processors. Then I have three hand-held blenders. There are so many different ways to smooth something out.\nIn my pantry, you’ll always find: spices and herbs. Also whole-grain flour, all-purpose flour, bread flour, pastry flour, barley, bulgur, quinoa—red and black—and red rice, pink rice, Himalayan rice. If I see it, it’s like, “Ooh, that could be great.” I need stock in some sort of Rubbermaid/ Tupperware TUP 2.44 % company because I put everything in an airtight container—rows and rows of snap-and-go holders.\nENLARGE The tupperware cabinet Photo: Laure Joliet for The Wall Street Journal The pans I reach for most are: cast-iron skillets. I do everything in them—cornbread, mac ’n’ cheese, sauce. I have tiny, personal-size skillets all the way up to a giant paella-size skillet. They show the evidence of fire, which I like. It’s the extreme.\nThe food I’m most excited about right now is: yogurt. I won’t lie to you: I’m 8 months pregnant and have hellacious heartburn. Yogurt is calming. Otherwise, I love all kinds of different curries. I love smoked salts. I get flavored salts whenever I travel. Different sea salts too, because each one has a special difference. And chili peppers—I love spicy foods, which is probably my problem at the moment.\nENLARGE A few cookbooks from her collection Photo: Laure Joliet for The Wall Street Journal The things I make most often are: one-pot meals. For my son, I do a lot of stews. They’re easy. I can fill them with vegetables and they’re hearty. And then I make bulgur pilaf or barley. It’s our in-the-week food. He’s got Muay Thai [kickboxing], soccer and drum lessons—a very busy schedule. This is the kind of thing he can eat after I pick him up.\nA typical breakfast for me: depends, lately. My son started a new school and I have to get him there a lot earlier than before. It used to be a leisurely “What will we have?” But now we’re rushing out the door. I’m big on bread in the morning. Sometimes if it’s been a leisurely weekend, I make my own. When I was pregnant the last time I was making bagels and doughnuts. I was like a factory.\nI love it when my dinner guests bring: wine. I always have wine, but I think: You’re going to drink it all so bring some more. I hate when people come and say, “I’m not so hungry.” I like when people come knowing they’re going to eat and then relax and chill. I drink red wine only. Australia is where I first got into it, but I like really full-bodied, sock-it-to-me reds that can be from all over—French, Spanish, Californian. I like beer, too, but I don’t know much about it. So I joined a beer-of-the-month club and they send me different microbrews. It makes it easy.\nMy interest in food started: when I was growing up in New York. After church on Sundays we’d go out for brunch. My mom was always taking me to restaurants. She used to have a catering business, so she was cooking all the time. It inadvertently happened: I became a foodie.\nENLARGE Spices gathered in her travels Photo: Laure Joliet for The Wall Street Journal My cooking mentor was: my mom. She was my first one. Now I have no problem asking people to show me something. When I travel, I meet people on the road. I just ask, “Will you show me that?” So I’ve had many mentors along the way teach me something specific, and I’ve cultivated what they taught me in my cooking. My kind of CliffsNotes or synopsis of a country: I find out what people wear, what they listen to and what they eat. Cooking is such a universal thing; so much of it is common sense. As I was traveling I saw so many parallels.\nI started cooking professionally because: it’s something I love to do and I found I’m good at. It’s the same reason I make music. My mom would say, “Nurture your natural talents, because that’s where you’ll find success.”\nThe most important piece of kitchen wisdom I ever received was: Don’t be afraid to play with fire. It was the best thing anyone said to me. That’s the way I cook now. I’m not afraid to char. I like the flame. That’s where the excitement is—the steam, the smoke and the essence that comes with it.\n—Edited from an interview by Charlotte Druckman\nMore In My Kitchen Musicians Jessie Baylin and Nathan Followill Anton Mosimann, the British Royals’ Favorite Chef Cleveland Chef Jonathon Sawyer Cookbook Author Sabrina Ghayour British Chef Mark Hix Cookbook Editor Judith Jones", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BI119_IMK_P_20151022115126.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KW968_KELIS_P_20151022145738.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KW968_KELIS_M_20151022145738.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BI120_IMK_P_20151022120449.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BI120_IMK_M_20151022120449.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BI121_IMK_FR_20151022120842.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BI122_IMK_8V_20151022121115.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OD-BI119_IMK_M_20151022115126.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:29:15.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
