(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) (Matt Rourke) Comments \nPHILADELPHIA -- Despite missing an extra point for the second consecutive week , the Eagles will stick with kicker Caleb Sturgis and have no plans to work out any kickers this week head coach Chip Kelly said Monday. \n\"We're not going to work out any kickers,\" Kelly said during his day after press conference at the NovaCare Complex on Monday afternoon. \"We're going to roll with Caleb.\" \nAfter signing with the Eagles prior to Week 4 against the Washington Redskins at FedEx Field, Sturgis is just 4-for-5 on field goal attempts and 5-for-7 on extra points. \n\"Caleb did a nice job,\" Kelly said of Sturgis' performance against the New Orleans Saints Sunday afternoon at Lincoln Financial Field. \"I thought he got in a nice groove, especially on kickoffs. Some of them were short, early but I think the last few he really hit really well. We had a slightly high snap on the snap/hold operation on the mixed extra point\" \nEAGLES: Nelson Agholor, Jordan Matthews working to eliminate drops \nBesides showing improvement on kickoffs in Week 5, Kelly sounded as if he is gaining trust in the 26-year-old, despite going for it on fourth down twice, including a 4th and 7 from the Saints' 45-yard line in the first quarter. \n\"I think he's getting more comfortable in there,\" Kelly said. \"With [special teams coach Dave] Fipp, [punter/holder] Donnie [Jones] and [longsnapper] Jon [Dorenbos] are getting on the same page. \n\"If you look from where he's been from week-to-week when we brought him in here in terms of having a short week to get ready for the first week we brought him in here and he's starting to get into a little bit of a rhythm. We'll see how that goes.\" \nSturgis' field goal percentage of 80 percent ranks 18th among 35 qualifying kickers who have attempted at least one field goal attempt in 2015. \nDespite Kelly's actions Sunday that indicated otherwise and Sturgis' shaky performance in his two games in an Eagles uniform, it doesn't sound as if this team has any plans to change kickers anytime soon. THE NO-HUDDLE SHOW, Ep. 11: Finally, a glimpse of what Eagles fans expected \nThere were plenty of encouraging signs in the Eagles' blowout win over the Saints. From Fletcher Cox's dominance to Josh Huff's emergence, the Eagles showed what they're capable of doing. Now the question is: Can they do it again vs. the Giants?
