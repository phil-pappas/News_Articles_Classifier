Nick Haig (5th minute) and Jared Panchia (27th) sounded the boards for New Zealand. The hosts earned a penalty corner and Haig flicked the ball on the top right corner of the goal to make it 1-0. India intensified their attacks and had a real chance when Nikkin Thimmaiah pushed the ball inside the circle from the right but a vigilant Kiwis defence denied them. In the 27th minute, New Zealand banked on a counter attack which helped Panchia score through a field effort. The teams will clash again on Wednesday. HI seeks time to reply to gurbajâ€™s ban Hockey India on Tuesday sought time from the Punjab and Haryana high court to prepare its reply to the petition filed by banned India midfielder Gurbaj Singh.
