Each team received 749 points. North Carolina received 12 first-place votes and Kentucky received 11 top votes. Kentucky started the past two seasons No. 1 in the poll. The Wildcats lost their top seven scorers from last season. This is the fourth time North Carolina is No. 1 to start the season, according to coaches. The coaches’ preseason poll began in 1994-95. The Tar Heels previously were No. 1 in the preseason in 2007-08, 2008-09 and 2011-12. “It’s a nice honor,” North Carolina coach Roy Williams said. “The last three times we were No. 1 in the preseason we had very good teams. I hope it will work out that way this year. We have veteran players who have gotten better each year. We are enjoying practice right now and look forward to the season.” It’s the first time there have been co-No. 1 teams in the initial poll. Three other schools received first-place votes — No. 3 Maryland (five), No. 4 Duke (three) and No. 5 Kansas (one). Duke is the defending national champion. The five teams that received first-place votes are the most since eight teams received first-place votes at the start of the 2004-05 season. Virginia is No. 6. Notre Dame, the defending Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament champion, is No. 18. The Associated Press media poll comes out next month.
