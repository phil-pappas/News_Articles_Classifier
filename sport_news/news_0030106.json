Over all it was a good experience but it was almost ruined by the so called 'chef' on board. He had a fire going - yes, a fire on the BBQ for quite some time, making it almost impossible to stay on top of the boat. Then he just left it for the other crew members to handle and 1/3rd of the food burned. Emmet, 10 March 2015, Xclusive 10 (53ft) You all were absolutely great.
