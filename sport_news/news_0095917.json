Both have been asked to return to the Phillies, but neither is a guarantee to return. Bowa went back for a second interview for the Miami Marlins manager vacancy last week and Samuel, who interviewed for the Phillies full-time managerial position last month, could also be listening to opportunities with other teams. \nIn addition to finalizing the coaching staff, the Phillies are obviously still searching for a general manager. They could reach the finish line before the end of the month. \nAccording to a Foxsports.com report, Oakland Athletics assistant general manager Dan Kantrovitz will interview a second time for the GM vacancy. Among the reported candidates, two assistant GMs, Los Angeles Angels' Matt Klentak and Kansas City Royals' J.J. Picollo, have been labeled favorites seemingly from the get-go of the search, which began when Ruben Amaro Jr. was fired on Sept. 10. Others in consideration include Thad Levine (Texas' assistant GM), Kim Ng (MLB commissioner's office), Matt Slater (St. Louis' director of player personnel), Ross Atkins (Cleveland's VP of player personnel) and Ben Cherington (formerly the GM in Boston). \nTeam president Andy MacPhail has said it would be \"ambitious\" for the Phillies to hire a new GM before the front office holds its annual organizational meetings, which begin in Clearwater, Fla., on Monday. Major League Baseball's general manager meetings take place in Boca Raton, Fla., the week of Nov. 9. Campbell's Field vacant \nThe independent league Camden Riversharks announced on their website on Wednesday that they were \"ceasing operations immediately\" after failing to come to an agreement with the Camden County Improvement Authority, a branch of the Camden County government that purchased Campbell's Field, the 15-year-old ballpark in April for $3.5 million. \n\"We would like to thank our partners and fans for supporting the club for 15 memorable seasons,\" read the statement on the team's website. \"We did everything we could to keep affordable, family entertainment alive and well in Camden.\" \nAccording to baseball sources, the Phillies have toured the facilities at Campbell's Field, which could potentially become home to one of their minor league affiliates (short-season Williamsport?). But the same sources said the Phils executives were not too keen on the ballpark, which despite its picturesque location on the Camden riverfront next the Ben Franklin Bridge, is in need of millions of dollars in renovations. \nThe Riversharks, meanwhile, will hold a final merchandising sale Thursday through Saturday, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m the next two days, and from 9-to-noon on Saturday. \nOn Twitter: @ryanlawrence21", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:40:56.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
