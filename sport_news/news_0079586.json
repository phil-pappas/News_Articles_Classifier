Quinton Flowers threw for a season-best 253 yards and two TDs, and the dual-threat quarterback also scored on a 2-yard run that put the game out of reach in the fourth quarter. \nUSF (2-3) stopped a skid that included losses to Florida State and Maryland on the road, and Memphis at home in the team's American Athletic Conference opener. \nSyracuse (3-2) lost for the second straight time after matching its victory for all of last year in the first three weeks of the season. \nFlowers completed 15 of 22 passes, including TD throws of 14 yards to Rodney Adams and 42 yards to Ryeshene Bronson on a flea-flicker that began with a handoff to Mack, who pitched the ball to Adams before the receiver lateraled back to Flowers. The quarterback's 2-yard scoring run finished a 15-play, 82-yard drive the Bulls put together to extend their lead to 38-24 with just under 10 minutes to go. \nEric Dungey was 21 of 34 for 232 yards and two TDs for Syracuse. But the freshman returning from an injury also threw his first interception of the season and lost a fourth-quarter fumble. \nUSF, which has sputtered offensively since scoring 51 in a season-opening victory over Florida A&M, gained 535 yards against a Syracuse defense that has struggled to stop the run. The Bulls gained 276 on the ground, with Mack averaging 8.5 yards per try on 17 carries, inflicting most of the damage after the Bulls built a 10-3 halftime lead. \nDungey returned to Syracuse's lineup after sitting out a 34-24 loss to LSU two weeks ago because of a head injury. The freshman tossed touchdown passes of 30 yards to Jordan Fredericks and 7 yards to Steve Ishmael. \nThe Orange entered Saturday as one of seven FBS teams that had yet to lose a fumble this season. Their streak ended late in the second quarter on a fluke play in which a USF punt bounced off a Syracuse player who was trying to get into a position to block. Devin Abraham recovered for USF, setting up Emilio Nadleman's 21-yard field goal as time expired in the half. \nA pair of touchdowns in the first 5:07 of the third quarter put USF up 24-3, but the Bulls didn't have an easy time closing out the Orange before a homecoming crowd of 27,237 that looked a lot smaller than the announced attendance. \nSyracuse twice pulled within seven points, the last time on Dungey's TD pass to Steve Ishmael on the first play of the fourth quarter. Both times the Orange drew close, though, USF's offense responded with long scoring drives to remain in control. \nDungey, who rushed for a team-leading 31 yards, scored on 7-yard run in the third quarter. Less than a minute later, Mack's 45-yard TD run finished a three-play, 75-yard drive that restored a two-touchdown lead. \nSyracuse finished with 305 yards total offense, but was limited to 73 rushing. Elusive H-back Ervin Phillips, who played after missing time with a knee injury, gained 21 yards on three carries and had five receptions for 75 yards. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:31:29.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
