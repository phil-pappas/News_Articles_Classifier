Butch Comegys / Staff Photographer \nWith the start of the girls high school basketball season just five weeks away, Ross Macciocco gave his team startling news Sunday night. \nHe’s stepped down before the start of his seventh season at Scranton Prep. \nIn 34 years as a head coach, 28 at Dunmore, the 65-year-old Macciocco is the winningest girls basketball coach in the area with 660 wins — and only three losing seasons. \nEfforts to reach Macciocco on Monday night were unsuccessful and Scranton Prep athletic director Scott Gower issued a statement to announce the move. \n“Scranton Prep is very grateful to Coach Macciocco for his leadership and service to the girls basketball program over the past six years,” the statement read. “His coaching experience and passion for the game are legendary and helped bring our program to the next level. We wish him much success as he moves on from Prep. The school administration will meet this week to determine a timeline and direction for filling the position. \n“In the meantime, Coach (Natalie) Winters and Coach (Tom) Bragan will continue to lead our pre-season workouts.” \nMacciocco and junior varsity coach Fred Lewis, Macciocco’s brother-in-law, have both stepped away from the program, a surprise to several former players who had spoken to Macciocco recently and said he was looking forward to the 2015-16 season. \nThe departures leave Winters, the former Forest City girls head basketball coach in her first season as an assistant at Prep, and Bragan, the freshman coach, as the lone remaining members of the staff. \nIn his 34 years, Macciocco captured 14 Lackawanna League championships, including the last three Division I titles with Prep. He also won seven District 2 titles, the last in the 2013-14 season with Prep. \n“He saw a lot of ability and potential within players that sometimes we didn’t see in ourselves,” said Holy Cross College sophomore Tricia Byrne, a member of the 2014 title team and a first-team All-State performer in Class AAA under Macciocco. “He gave us the flexibility to grow as players. The lessons I learned from four years playing with him, continue to resonate with me more as I go through my experiences on the college level. \n“He definitely had an influence on not only my basketball career, but to develop myself as an individual. I’m forever thankful to him, and I think a lot of our players would say the same thing. He’s impacted us as more than just basketball players.” \nFormer Dunmore star Lauren Carra, another first-team All-State player in Class AA, said she learned as much about life under Macciocco as she did about basketball. \n“Playing under coach Macciocco, it wasn’t just about basketball,” Carra said. “It was providing us with what we were going to need for what came next after high school. Not only basketball skills, but also the life skills that we needed. He had the balance that I needed between being a tough coach and what it was that he wanted us to learn. And that was the most important thing.” \nContact the writer: \nmmyers@timesshamrock.com @mmyersTT on Twitter We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.
