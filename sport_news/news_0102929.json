If the rain continues it's just logic we won't run today. Even if it just drizzles we can't go out there. I'm sure we'll run tomorrow,\" Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo told the BBC.\nThe Australian had not even changed into his overalls.\nIf qualifying does not happen on Saturday, it could be held on Sunday morning if the weather improves as expected. Otherwise, the times from final practice will set the grid.\nWorld champion Lewis Hamilton, who could win his third title on Sunday, was fastest in that session for Mercedes. The Briton has won two of the three previous races held in Austin.\n(Editing by Frank Pingue)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T22:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:07:02.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
