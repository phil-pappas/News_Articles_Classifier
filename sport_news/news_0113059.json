The Royals lead 2-0 in the best-of-seven series.\n\"We reviewed all our staffing levels and police deployment and we're confident that was adequate,\" Coutinho said. \"We did our own internal assessment after (Game 5) with the police and then Major League Baseball followed up as well.\"\nCoutinho wouldn't say how many Toronto police officers would be at Monday's game, but said the number was \"fairly high.\"\nThe Blue Jays reserved the right to cut off beer sales after the fifth inning if there are any problems.\nIn the seventh inning of Toronto's Game 5 win over Texas, a raucous crowd turned rowdy when Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin's seemingly routine return toss to the pitcher hit Texas batter Shin-Soo Choo.\nThe ball rolled loose and the go-ahead run for the Rangers. During an 18-minute delay to sort out the ruling, fans tossed beer cans among other debris. Many of the cans didn't reach the field, striking fans in the seats close to the field.\nToronto scored four runs in the bottom of the inning and went on to win 6-3.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
