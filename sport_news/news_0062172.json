Conklin hasn't played since suffering a knee injury Sept. 26 against Central Michigan. \nMSU still hasn't announced if Allen and Conklin are actually available to play, and no starting lineup has been issued yet. In pre-game warmups, backup center Brian Allen was snapping to Connor Cook, and Jack Allen was not on the field. \nAlso today, MSU senior defensive end Shilique Calhoun is switching from his normal No. 89 to No. 43 to honor teammate Ed Davis. Davis, a senior linebacker, is missing the season after suffering a knee injury in camp.
