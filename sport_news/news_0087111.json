This need inspired me to come up with my fishing invention.\"\nHe created a prototype for the patent-pending SURE SET to hold a fishing rod and alert the user to a strike on the line. The device sets the hook quickly and effectively in the fish's mouth. This increases the chances of making a successful catch and makes fishing trips more productive and enjoyable. Furthermore, the accessory features a compact, easily portable design.\nThe original design was submitted to the Salt Lake City office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
