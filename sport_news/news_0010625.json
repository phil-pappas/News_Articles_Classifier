An Israeli nonprofit may be the first private group landing on the moon.\nSpaceIL announced Wednesday that it signed a contract to fly to the moon aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.\nThe nonprofit, which is competing in the Google Lunar XPRIZE, is the first in the competition to sign a launch contract and have it verified by XPRIZE.\nGOOGLE TO OFFER FREE VIRTUAL REALITY FIELDTRIP KITS\n\"We are proud to officially confirm receipt and verification of SpaceIL's launch contract, positioning them as the first and only Google Lunar XPRIZE team to demonstrate this important achievement, thus far,\" said Bob Weiss, vice chairman and president of XPRIZE. \"The magnitude of this achievement cannot be overstated, representing an unprecedented and monumental commitment for a privately-funded organization, and kicks off an exciting phase of the competition.\"\nGoogle Lunar XPRIZE is a contest that offers $20 million to the first private group that can land a rover on the moon, travel 500 meters and transmit HD photos and video back to Earth.\nRONEN ZVULUN/REUTERS Israeli President Reuven Rivlin (2nd L), minister of Science, Technology and Space, Ofir Akunis (5th L) and members of the Israeli team, SpaceIL, look at a model of an Israeli spacecraft, during a meeting in Jerusalem. If SpaceIL—or any other team—is successful in launching their lunar spacecraft, access to the moon would no longer be exclusive to nations; other private groups would also be able to land their spacecraft on the moon.\nSpaceIL's rocket is expected to launch into space in the second half of 2017. This blast off would also mark the first time an Israeli spacecraft has gone to the moon.\nSo far, only three countries have soft-landed a rover on the surface of the moon: the U.S., China and the former Soviet Union.\nThe Lunar XPRIZE competition will end on Dec. 31, 2017, which means that all 16 teams participating have till then to launch, land and send back high-resolution footage. The 15 teams that have yet to present launch contracts have until the end of 2016 to get them verified by XPRIZE.\nRelated Stories Discovery makes a successful launch into space in 1988 GoPro camera returns 2 years after being launched into space NASA to launch 4K TV channel in November", "external_links": ["http://www.spaceil.com/videos/israeli-glxp-team-is-first-to-sign-launch-agreement-for-private-mission-to-the-moon-on-spacex-falcon-9/"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:04:16.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
