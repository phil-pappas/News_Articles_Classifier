IMPACT: Adelaide import Jerome Randle, who starred on debut, celebrates a three pointer in the face of Cairns’ Shaun Bruce. Picture: SARAH REED Source: News Corp Australia \nADELAIDE import Jerome Randle jumped straight off the plane and into the Taipans’ nightmares, starring in his NBL debut as the 36ers trumped Cairns 88-79 last night. \nIt was the first of five straight away games for Cairns (2-2), who now face the intimidating task of the unbeaten Melbourne United (4-0) on Saturday night. \nRandle, a replacement for injured import Kenyon McNeaill, finished with 24 points as he razzled and dazzled in front of his new home crowd and sent a warning shot to the league. \nCairns trailed at every stop but breathed life into the game with a 13-point run that drew them level with the hosts in the third quarter. \nThat was sparked by back-to-back triples from Cameron Gliddon (13 points, six rebounds, four assists), while in his 300th game Cameron Tragardh (16 points, four rebounds, three assists) chimed in with regular points and Mark Worthington (nine points, nine rebounds, five assists) did his best to influence the outcome. \nBut Randle and import partner Ebi Ere put a stop to the trio’s revival, both nailing triples to open the final quarter before Randle twice raided the rim and blew the margin beyond reach. \nAdelaide shot 22 free throws to Cairns’ six, Randle the main instigator as he attacked from the moment he checked in. \nDespite all that, Cairns’ import Markel Starks had his best outing in orange, finding his groove in the final quarter to finish with 15 points and four assists. \nAdelaide 36ers 88 (Randle 24, Gibson 15) \nCairns Taipans 79 (Tragardh 16, Starks 15)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:44:35.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
