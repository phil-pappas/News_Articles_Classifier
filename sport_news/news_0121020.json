Ryan Harding put the home team ahead 11 minutes into the second half, and Felix Abel-Ferretti gave Dryden some insurance off a feed from Lewis. \nDryden gave up a late goal on a free kick after getting into foul trouble, according to Engel. \nThe Purple Lions wrap up the regular season on Monday evening against state-ranked Lansing (11-0-1), which was scheduled to play Southern Cayuga in its Senior Night game on Friday.
