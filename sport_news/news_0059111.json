Meanwhile, other programs have upped the ante by adding high-profile recruits and coaches.\nWhile UK was once again picked to win the SEC, voting was close (and perhaps the talent gap even tighter) among the top four teams. Vanderbilt, Texas A&M and LSU, picked second through fourth, “could easily win our league,” Cats coach John Calipari said Wednesday at the SEC’s media day.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nSEC coaches: Pitino can't be all-seeing\nHe also believes those programs, and a veteran Georgia team that nearly knocked off Kentucky last season, smell blood in the water after his roster was rebooted by the loss of seven underclassmen to the NBA.\n“When I said, ‘My team stinks right now,’ I think a lot of coaches were very happy,” Calipari said. “Didn’t know if I was telling the truth or not, but they were happy, hoping I was.”\nThe rest of the league isn’t just waiting for a break, though. Several programs have aggressively upgraded: Mississippi State hiring former UCLA coach Ben Howland and landing five-star (UK target) Malik Newman, LSU landing consensus top-two overall recruit Ben Simmons and fellow five-star Antonio Blakeney, Texas A&M signing a top-10 recruiting class.\nTennessee hired former Texas coach Rick Barnes. Alabama hired former NBA player and coach Avery Johnson. South Carolina signed Perry Dozier, the program’s first McDonald’s All-American in 15 years.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nKentucky Basketball | League favorites again, three Cats make preseason All-SEC\n“Now it’s not just that one team that everyone’s saying, ‘We just can’t wait to see Kentucky play’ in the SEC,” Newman said. “I think it’s several teams in the SEC that people are wanting to see play. I think the whole league is good. With the addition of some top-tier players and the addition of some top-tier coaches, I think the whole league is better.”\nVanderbilt has a projected first-round NBA draft pick, 7-footer Damian Jones, who is surrounded by sharpshooting guards that should make the Commodores a real threat.\n“It’s nice dispersing the talent around so every game is going to be intense,” Jones said. “The SEC is really rising. I think we should make some big strides this year.”\nOf course, ultimately that is judged by NCAA Tournament bids and making noise in March. The league had a bit of a breakthrough last season, earning five invitations to The Dance, but it’s still been a decade since an SEC team not named Kentucky or Florida made the Final Four.\n“We just gotta win some games now,” Calipari said of the league. “It starts with a commissioner’s office that wants basketball to do well and has put an emphasis on basketball and said, ‘Look, we need to grow this,’ and they have. Then you talk about facilities, investing in these basketball programs, which we have. Then you talk about a scientific schedule so we can help each other non-conference. We’ve done that. Then it becomes, ‘OK, we gotta go get some (players).’ Well, we’re doing that.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nLSU's Simmons, Fournette share top billing\n“Then you gotta win games. Now, we’ve won NCAA Tournament games. The reason we haven’t had more teams (in the tournament): we lost some bad games in November and December.”\nTexas A&M guard Alex Caruso, a preseason All-SEC pick, reeled off a stat about the league playing a tougher non-conference schedule than anyone in the country this season. He drew significant meaning – and sense of responsibility – from that.\n“Schools are realizing that they have a greater talent and better teams, so they’ve gone out and scheduled games against harder opponents,” Caruso said. “Eventually, you’re going to have to win games. That’s how you prove it to everybody. I think we’re on the right track for that. The conference just needs to take care of business.”\nSign up to get more like this free in your inbox\nOf course, we’ve heard all this before. The resurgence of SEC basketball has lately been a bit like Bigfoot: always supposedly lurking nearby but never actually captured on film.\n“If that’s the perception right now, then that just means we’re not doing our job, and we gotta make sure that this year we make it known,” Ole Miss star Stefan Moody said. “All the other teams are ready to step up and prove to the world that it’s not just Kentucky.”\nKyle Tucker can be reached at (502) 582-4361.
