Penalty kill helps Flyers win home opener; Berube back at WFC Sam Carchidi Posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015, 2:37 AM \nThe Flyers’ penalty-killing units, awful in Saturday’s six-goal loss in Florida, redeemed themselves in their home opener Monday night. \nSo did the Flyers, who blanked the Panthers, 1-0, before a sellout crowd at the electric Wells Fargo Center. \nThe Flyers’ penalty killers were 6 for 6 and allowed just five shots in 11:54 of Florida power-play time. \nJust 1:17 into the game, the Flyers were shorthanded because of an inadvertent high-sticking penalty that sent Michael Raffl to the penalty box for four minutes. More coverage Latest hockey odds \nThe Flyers had some shaky moments on that PK, but they survived. \n“We didn’t have a rhythm as a team, and we still killed it,” defenseman Mark Streit said. “It gave us a lot of momentum.” \nForty seconds after the penalty expired, Brayden Schenn scored what turned out to be the game-winner. \nMichael Del Zotto (6:35), Nick Schultz (5:45), and Brandon Manning (5:22) logged the most shorthanded minutes among defensemen. Pierre-Edouard Bellemare (4:50), Chris VandeVelde (4:49), and Claude Giroux (4:01) were the forwards who were given the most time on the penalty kill. \nGiroux is getting more PK time than last year, and he is creating shorthanded scoring chances. \nThe Flyers had six penalties in the first two periods and none in the third. \n“We took too many penalties and it’s tough to win hockey games like that when you use so much energy,” Streit said. \nIn Saturday’s 7-1 loss to Florida, the Flyers surrendered three goals in seven power-play chances. \nMichal Neuvirth (see story) made 31 saves and became the first Flyer to register a shutout in his first Flyers start since Ray Emery in 2009, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. \nNeuvirth recorded just the fifth shutout in a Flyers home opener in franchise history. It was the team’s first 1-0 win in a home opener since their first home game in franchise history, Oct. 19, 1967 against Pittsburgh. \n“Our (penalty) killers were great, and Neuvy was a calming influence back there making a ton of saves,” winger Sam Gagner said. “He was awesome.” \nDitto the penalty killers. \nBerube back. Former Flyers coach Craig Berube, who was fired after last season, returned to the Wells Fargo Center Monday and sat in the press box as a scout for Hockey Canada, which will select players for next year's Canadian World Cup team. \nBerube said he will scout in East Coast arenas, but that his goal was to return to coaching. He said he interviewed for a few coaching jobs after the Flyers let him go. \n\"It's good to be around the rinks and see the teams and meeting people,\" he said. \"I have to stay out there (to keep his name around for a coaching opening.)\" \nBreakaways. Giroux won 15 of 21 faceoffs (71 percent), but his teammates won just 13 of the other 35 draws (37.1 percent)…..Radko Gudas and Brayden Schenn each had five hits….Raffl had a game-high six shots….Jaromir Jagr was held to two shots in 18:41…..The defending Stanley Cup champion Blackhawks will make their only Wells Fargo Center appearance of the season Wednesday at 8 p.m. About 600 tickets remain, and the Flyers will honor Kimmo Timonen before the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:14:10.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
