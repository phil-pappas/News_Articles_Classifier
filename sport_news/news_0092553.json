Additional support and stability is delivered in the sole platform through Mizuno Double Fan Wave® technology, which offers responsiveness from heel to midfoot; and new support groove pattern that evens out weight distribution at impact throughout the entire transition from heel to forefoot.\n\"The Wave Inspire 12 takes the moderate support shoe to another level, delivering the built-in support and cushion runners are seeking without adding weight and bulk to the shoe,\" said Mark Sheehan , Vice President of Product Management – Running, Mizuno USA . \"The dynamic mix of Mizuno technologies will enable runners to push further than ever with confidence and comfort.\"\nAdding to the enhancements in the new Wave Inspire 12, the upper was completely redesigned to provide a soft yet structural fit using 3D Fit technology.

The stability and cushion were the perfect combination for my running style.\" – C hristina Valenziano, theblissfulbalance.com\n\"The Mizuno Wave Inspire 12s are by far one of the lightest stability shoes I have ever put on.
