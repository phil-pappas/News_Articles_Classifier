In fact, it's not if it strikes, but rather how a team deals with it when it does. \nThanks to a slew of injuries to key players, including quarterback Drew Brees and cornerback Keenan Lewis, the Saints stumbled to an 0-3 start. And when adversity reared its head yet again in the form of a missed would-be game-winning field goal late in the fourth quarter against Dallas on Sunday, the Saints refused to fold. Instead they broke through in stunning fashion, as Brees hit C.J. Spiller in stride for the game-winning 80-yard touchdown. \nAs a result of the 26-20 overtime win, this week it's not how the team deals with adversity, but rather how it responds to its newfound success. \n\"It does not entitle you to anything the next game. Right? So you have to understand that.\" Brees said. \"I think that while it does breed confidence and makes you feel better about yourself, maybe puts a little pep in your step on Monday and Tuesday. Bottom line is you still have to put the time, effort, the work and be disciplined with your routine and preparation if you want to win again.\" \nAnd surely the Saints do. Plus, they can ill afford another loss, particularly given that Atlanta and Carolina remain unbeaten and sit atop the NFC South at 4-0. \nNevertheless, for the man on the receiving end of that game winner, which also happened to be Brees' 400th career touchdown, turning the page after such a dramatic victory was easy. But for others, he said, that's not always the case. \n\"Everybody's different. Me, I'm pretty much even keeled,\" Spiller said. \"So you have to be able to handle success, you have to be able to handle failure. I've already moved on to the Philadelphia Eagles, and that's gonna be a tough game.\" \nThe fully expect Chip Kelly's high-octane offense, albeit one that surprisingly ranks 30th this season, to present a unique challenge on Sunday. Slowing down the Eagles three-headed monster -- DeMarco Murry, Ryan Matthews and Darren Sproles â€“ is crucial if the Saints hope to leave the City of Brotherly Love with a win. \nMoreover, the guys on the defensive line understand the importance of not letting all the misdirection the Eagle employ fool them. \n\"With them doing all these zones and stuff real wide it's tempting to try and come underneath, thinking you can make the play,\" Saints rookie defensive tackle Tyler Davison said. \"But you see on film a lot of times the play isn't made when you try to come underneath and that leaves a big old gap, your gap that you're leaving to try and go risk it. There's been a lot of guys trying to risk it and go get them and it hasn't worked so you really have to stay in your gap and stay home.\" \nIf the Saints can do that and keep Philly's stable of running backs bottled up, they're confident they can return home riding a two-game winning streak, which would put New Orleans in position to pull to .500, when Atlanta comes to town a week from Thursday.
