The concerns stem from claims that Hamilton has looked to secure funds for a prep school he founded, called Reach Your Dream Prep, in exchange for recruiting Labissiere.\nHamilton founded the school, which is essentially a team built around Labissiere, after he transferred the player from Evangelical Christian School to Lausanne Collegiate School before his senior year, making him ineligible.\nLabissiere, rated the No. 1 player in the 2015 class by Rivals.com, has been practicing with the team. The 6'11\" center is in the early conversation for the No. 1 pick in next year's NBA Draft.\n• After the quake: Skal Labissiere’s incredible journey to Kentucky\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.si.com/", "http://www.si.com/college-basketball/2015/10/12/skal-labissiere-kentucky-wildcats-freshman-haiti-earthquake", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/eye-on-college-basketball/25338199/ncaa-questions-aau-coach-about-kentucky-freshman-skal-labissieres-guardian"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:48:54.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
