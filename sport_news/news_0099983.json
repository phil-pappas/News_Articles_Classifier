They are even providing technical knowhow to make the new houses earthquake resistant,\" she added.\nWith tears in her eyes, Nirmaya, whose farm is just less than half a hectare, said she lost her husband and daughter in the deadly 7.9-magnitude earthquake that hit Nepal on April 25, killing more than 8,800 people. There have been several aftershocks since then.\nThe Gyalwang Drukpa's international foundation, 'Live to Love', announced the construction of 201 earthquake-resistant homes.\n\"All the homes are in different stages of construction in nine adopted villages. We are building them through community participation,\" said Jigme Rigzin, housing project manager of the 'Live to Love' foundation.\nShe said a prefabricated community hall was also constructed in Kallabari village, which will be used for a community school that was also damaged in the quake.\n\"This was my home,\" said short-statured Tulki Tamang.\nLimping slightly, she looks considerably older than her 73 years. \"This was the house,\" she said in feeble voice, pointing to the demolished structure.\nShe said they were living comfortably before the quake.\n\"My house was totally damaged and I lost everything. We are currently staying in this temporary hutment. Now that the monsoon is over, we will soon move to this upcoming house,\" added Tulki, who was busy in sifting the harvested maize corns in the courtyard.\nMaroon-robed nun Rigzin, revered for her rehabilitation work, said most quake-hit families were busy in agricultural activities till July. Then the monsoon delayed the rebuilding of the structures.\n\"Now we are hoping to provide houses to all the families before the onset of winter.\" She said that in Kallabari village alone 40 houses were partially or fully damaged.\nFarm labourer Singhdhwoj Tamang has shifted to the new house.\n\"Since the quake, we had been staying in a temporary structure. Now we got the new house that was raised by utilising available material like corrugated roofs and wood retrieved from the destroyed property,\" Tamang said.\nIn the post-earthquake rehabilitation by 'Live to Love', Oscar-winning Hollywood actress Susan Sarandon and actress Michelle Yeoh, famous for her roles in Oscar-winning \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\", visited villages adopted by the international charity.\nThey stayed with the kung fu nuns, who work for 'Live to Love', by doing community outreach, offering medical services and acting as role models of women empowerment.\nThe nuns have also been trained in driving, plumbing and electrical work, and can also work with computers and cameras.\nThe Druk Amitabha Mountain nunnery, which houses the youngest nun of about nine years and the oldest about 60 years old, was also damaged in the earthquake. The nuns sleep and meditate in the tents.\nSixty per cent of Nepal's people are engaged in agriculture.\nThe World Bank says 47 percent of Nepalese farmers have less than half a hectare (or 5,000 square metres) of land.\nThe Nepalese government has provided Rs 15,000 cash as an emergency relief to help the quake-hit families to build temporary shelters.\nIt has announced Rs 2,00,000 each to the families rendered homeless along with Rs 15,000 emergency cash relief for building temporary shelters.\nAccording to the Nepal Risk Disaster Reduction portal 6,02,257 private houses were fully damaged in the Himalayan state, while partially damaged houses totalled 2,85,099. â€”IANS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:24:02.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
