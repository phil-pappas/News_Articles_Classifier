That run also included his first hat-trick for United as they hammered Southampton 6-1 at Old Trafford on December 22, 2001. \nDANIEL STURRIDGE: Eight games, Liverpool, run finished February 2014 \nLuis Suarez stole a lot of the headlines as Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool challenged for the league title in 2013-14, but Sturridge notched against Everton and Arsenal as he scored in eight successive games. \nJAMIE VARDY: Seven games, Leicester, August to October 2015 (not finished) \nMan-of-the-moment Vardy has catapulted himself into illustrious company with nine goals in his last seven matches. The 28-year-old leads the Premier League goalscoring charts with 10 strikes and is bound to draw admiring glances from other clubs if he can keep this up. \nMARK STEIN: Seven games, Chelsea, run finished February 1994 \nStein starred for Chelsea at a difficult time. Despite his seven-game streak, the Blues only claimed three victories during that time. \nIAN WRIGHT: Seven games, Arsenal, run finished November 1994 \nWright was simply sensational for Arsenal as he plundered 18 Premier League goals in 1994-95, with his scoring run including a win against his old club Crystal Palace. \nALAN SHEARER: Seven games, run finished Newcastle November 1996 \nIn his first season as a Newcastle player, Shearer hit the ground running with a remarkable scoring run that included a goal in a 5-0 win over Manchester United. \nTHIERRY HENRY: Seven games, Arsenal, run finished May 2000 \nDespite struggling initially in the Premier League, it did not take long for Henry's immense class to shine through. His run of scoring in seven consecutive games towards the end of the 1999-2000 campaign gave Arsenal fans a glimmer of what was to come. \nEMMANUEL ADEBAYOR: Seven games, Arsenal, run finished February 2008 \nBefore Adebayor was skidding on his knees to goad Arsenal fans, he was leading the line for them. His tally of nine goals in seven games helped the Gunners to six wins in that time, with Arsenal en route to a third-placed finish.
