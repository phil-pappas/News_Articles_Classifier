(Ben Nelms/The Canadian Press) Oilers beat Canucks 2-1 in OT 0:29 Related Stories \nThe Edmonton Oilers and Winnipeg Jets carried winning momentum into their Sunday games against the Vancouver Canucks and St. Louis Blues, respectively. Here's how they fared. Oilers post overtime win vs. Canucks \nLauri Korpikoski scored on a breakaway at 1:46 of overtime as the Oilers defeated the Canucks 2-1. \nNail Yakupov scored in regulation for Edmonton (2-4-0), which beat the Calgary Flames 5-2 a night earlier for the club's first win of the season. Anders Nilsson made 33 stops. \nTied 1-1 through 40 minutes, Canucks forward Daniel Sedin was left shaking his head early in the third period after somehow chipping a puck that was lying in the crease over the Oilers' goal with Nilsson down and out following a great stop on a Henrik Sedin breakaway seconds earlier. \nEdmonton opened the scoring at 3:23 of the first period on the power play after some excellent work from Connor McDavid. The No. 1 pick at June's draft, who had two goals and an assist in Calgary on Saturday, picked up the puck in the neutral zone and stepped around a check before feeding Yakupov for a one-timer that beat Miller from the slot. Tarasenko lifts Blues past Jets \nSt. Louis sharpshooter Vladimir Tarasenko scored his fourth and fifth goals on the season, including the game-winner in the Blues' 4-2 victory in Winnipeg against the Jets. It was their fourth win in a row. \nTarasenko, who opened the scoring in the second period with a nifty shot over the glove of Ondrej Pavelec, broke a 2-2 tie in the third period and the Blues added a power play score by Carl Gunnarson. \nNikolaj Ehlers and Mathieu Perreault scored the Jets goals as Winnipeg lost for the first time on home ice. \nThe game began with a scrappy, goalless first period at the MTS Centre with the emphasis on hitting with three roughing penalties thrown in for good measure. After the initial hostilities were out of the way,the teams concentrated more on scoring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:56:00.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
