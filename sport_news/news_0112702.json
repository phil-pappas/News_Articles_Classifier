Hossein Hamedani, a corps deputy commander, was killed near Aleppo and two other officers have also died fighting ISIS forces in Syria, Iran's Tasnim news agency said.\nTwo senior Hezbollah officers have also been killed in Syria in the last week, a Lebanese security source said.\nARMY RETAKES VILLAGES\nRami Abdulrahman, director of UK-based monitoring group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said there were heavy clashes near the Jebel Azzan region, about 12 km (8 miles) south of Aleppo city.\nThe area that the army and Russian jets were targeting was close to a main road heading south towards the capital Damascus, Abdulrahman said.\nThe army had recaptured the village of Abtin from rebel fighters, he said, as well as a tank battalion base close to Sabiqiya village. Both villages lie close to Jebel Azzan. Rebels had hit one army tank with a US-made TOW anti-tank missile.\nThe military source said the rebel fighters were mainly from the Islamist group Ahrar al-Sham and al Qaeda's Syrian wing, the Nusra Front, as well as the Suqour al-Sham and Failaq al-Sham insurgent groups.\nThe head of another rebel brigade Fursan al Haq, which is backed by Assad's foreign opponents and operates under the umbrella of the Free Syrian Army, said his fighters had sent more TOW missiles to the Aleppo area to try to stem the attack.\n\"The battle is ongoing, and the resistance is stronger than the attack,\" Fares al Bayoush, told Reuters.\nSince Russia launched air strikes on Sept. 30 in support of Assad, the army has waged offensives against several insurgent-held regions in western Syria, starting with areas of Hama, Idlib and Latakia provinces taken by the rebels over the summer.\nMoscow says its air campaign has targeted ISIS fighters in Syria, much like the US-led international coalition that has been separately striking the ultra-hardline Islamist group in Syria and neighbouring Iraq for over a year.\nBut most of the Russian air strikes appear to have targeted rival, foreign-backed insurgents whose advances in recent months, helped by supplies of the US-made TOW missiles, had threatened Assad's grip on power.\nOn Thursday the army targeted a long-held rebel enclave north of the city of Homs, with coordinated air strikes, artillery bombardment and ground assaults.\nThe Observatory said on Friday the death toll from the fighting there had risen to 60, including 30 women and children. Responding to the reports of civilian deaths on Thursday, a Syrian military source Quote: d by state media said Russian jets and Syrian forces do not target civilian areas.\nAssad's opponents say Syrian forces have killed many thousands of civilians in the course of the war, particularly with the use of untargeted \"barrel bombs\" dropped from helicopters above rebel-held cities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:08:57.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
