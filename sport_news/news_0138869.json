(Photo: FABRICE COFFRINI, AFP/Getty Images)\n8 CONNECT 38 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Sepp Blatter is done, out of office as FIFA president and in all likelihood out of the game for good. Forget about the 90-day term of the suspension levied upon him by the FIFA Ethics Committee, there is no path now for soccer’s self-styled godfather other than scrambling to keep himself out of the reach of various international legal authorities.\nAnd so the clean-up must finally begin, a task so great and imposing that it begs the question of whether it might not be better just to rip up the whole sorry edifice of FIFA and start again.\nWhile such an approach would seem to have utopian merit, in reality what soccer needs is reform, not a rebuild.\nFIFA has operated with a multitude of flaws for far too long, even before Blatter’s reign began in 1998. Yet the fault was not with its system, but with the corrupt hands that tainted it and some byzantine regulations that failed to hold those in charge to account.\nUSA TODAY\nArmour: FIFA must clean house or face 'disaster'\nThe fact that it was FIFA’s own ethics committee, including member who have been chummy with Blatter for so long, who took action to force his exit, shows that those in the now-shaky corridors of power finally realize that if the game isn’t up, it has certainly changed.\nSports, politics and especially sports politics, will always attract those hungry for power, self-interest, prestige and ego-stroking. That’s just the way it is. When those people become dangerous is if they are enabled or encouraged by a working environment that allows malfeasance to be the norm.\nFor the most part, FIFA’s delegates are not people of power, they are people of fear. They are like leeches seeking to draw strength from others. They gravitate to the biggest, toughest kid in the playground and seek to ride on his or her coattails.\nNow, the biggest kid is gone, suspended and possibly bound for the kind of detention that earns more than a ticking off from your parents.\nUSA TODAY\nRogers: Is the guy replacing Sepp Blatter as FIFA head just as bad?\nThere is a new beast to fear. It is the law and it is being imposed in several countries, following the worthy example of the United States and its Justice Department.\nThose who were only ever in it for the kickbacks, will soon fade into the shadows, slipping away quietly and hoping no one notices.\nFIFA became awful because of Blatter and his cronies, because of the deal-making and alleged disregard for anything resembling fairness or transparency.\nThat FIFA took the step of cutting those odious tentacles itself suggests the road to reform might actually be easier than most people think.\nThat’s not because we should believe the delegated of FIFA are stand-up guys, but because they’re not brave enough to do anything shady without a protective arm around them.\n8 CONNECT 38 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4f991564e8b4474b2919bc7f475c6f8208901f8c/c=340-130-2890-3530&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799005166877564-AFP-545143097.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Lk0FoF&text=Rogers%3A%20Cleaning%20up%20FIFA%20just%20got%20easier%20with%20Sepp%20Blatter%20ousted&via=usatoday", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4543174859001_thumbnail-for-video-4543110470001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1Lk0FoF&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/1Rw3fJ5", "http://embed.5min.com/PlayerSeed/?sid=1789&width=100&height=auto&playList=519139934&responsive=true&ratio=1&align=1&pgType=console&pgTypeId=editVideo-overviewTab-grabCodeBtn&ver=1", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2faf0c03a5b7963e4155d5a7e273147c9ff2b280/c=976-0-4256-3280/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798952297358659-AFP-545148255.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b59eff4c59c1120cc42567cc5861602b269114a2/r=357x400/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799005166877564-AFP-545143097.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9cbd8e5f307ca8892deea10de440721b72431926/c=485-0-2818-2333/local/-/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798940981826124-450606366.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4543174861001_video-still-for-video-4543110470001.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4543174861001_video-still-for-video-4543110470001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4543174861001_video-still-for-video-4543110470001.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/08/USATODAY/USATODAY/635799005166877564-AFP-545143097.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:05:07.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
