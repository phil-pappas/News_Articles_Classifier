Back | Next THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Kansas freshman quarterback Ryan Willis (13) completed 35 of 50 passes for 350 yards, the highest output by a KU quarterback since Todd Reesing in 2009, but the Jayhawks' upset bid against Texas Tech still fell short, 30-20, Saturday in Lawrence. By Jesse Newell jesse.newell@cjonline.com \nLAWRENCE — Ryan Willis led Kansas to the brink of a major upset, but he couldn’t quite finish the feat. \nThe true freshman threw a pick-six with 4:07 left in the game, ending KU’s hopes of victory in a 30-20 loss to Texas Tech on Saturday at Memorial Stadium. \nWhat happened before that, though, was one of KU’s most encouraging signs this season. The Miege product completed 35 of 50 passes for 350 yards, which was the highest output by a KU quarterback since Todd Reesing in 2009. \nKU’s defense also played its best game. Texas Tech, which allowed just two sacks in its first six games, surrendered five to KU on Saturday, as the Jayhawks’ defensive line hurried QB Patrick Mahomes most of the day. The Red Raiders’ 30 points also were a season low. \nKU, which entered as a 33-point underdog, trailed 20-0 at half before starting its comeback. The Jayhawks scored three second-half TDs, capped by a Taylor Cox 1-yard run with 6:26 left in the fourth that cut the lead to 23-20. \nThe Jayhawks’ defense forced a punt on the ensuing possession, but Willis followed with his only interception. \nKU (0-6, 0-3 Big 12) also had better success in the run game, with De’Andre Mann posting 107 yards on 15 carries. \nMahomes was 30-for-51 for 359 yards with a touchdown and interception for Tech (4-2, 1-2). \nKU will play at Oklahoma State at 2:30 p.m. on Oct. 24. \nTexas Tech (5-3, 2-2) 3 17 3 7 — 30 \nKansas (0-6, 0-3) 0 0 6 14 — 20 \nFIRST QUARTER \nTTU — Hatfield 30 field goal, 0:36.
