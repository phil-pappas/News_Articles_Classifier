(Photo: Joseph Maiorana, USA TODAY Sports)\n59 CONNECT 23 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Maryland coach Randy Edsall angrily walked out of a news conference Saturday following a reporter's question implying he may have coached his final game with the Terrapins — an eventuality that was the subject of much speculation in media reports this week .\nShortly after a 49-28 loss at No. 1 Ohio State, Edsall first dodged a direct question about his job status at Maryland by saying he plans to focus on what he can control and noting, \"it's about the kids.\" The following question stirred him up, however. He was asked if he normally shook hands of players before every game, the implication that if not, he was essentially saying thank you and farewell. Edsall, his frustration evident in his voice, growled that he's done that before every game, then stood up and walked out to a smattering of applause.\nUSA TODAY\nNo. 1 Ohio State shakes off Maryland\nMaryland is idle this next week, presenting a logical time for a transition to an interim coach.\nIt appears a coaching change at Maryland is inevitable barring a massive and immediate turnaround. Maryland is 2-3 this season and had been non-competitive in its previous two games: a 45-6 loss at West Virginia and a 28-0 home loss to Michigan in which it managed just 105 yards of offense.\nEdsall is 22-34 at Maryland. Earlier this year, he signed a contract extension through 2019, but only a portion of that salary was guaranteed.\nYou'll want to see @RandyEdsall 's response to a reporter asking about shaking players' hands before today's game. http://t.co/fxBT5513wT\n— BIG 10.10 (@BigTenNetwork) October 10, 2015 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/27bc20a0648d3d758267943605077cf85d476c38/c=271-0-2212-1941/local/-/media/2015/10/10/USATODAY/usatsports/4a4816078f27722d840f6a7067000387.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800926962112211-USATSI-8851072.jpg", "https://twitter.com/RandyEdsall", "http://t.co/fxBT5513wT", "https://twitter.com/BigTenNetwork/status/652937488554594304", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/47dfb57d08c7997f89e788d8ea4dd7b04e244f33/r=500x344/local/-/media/2015/10/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800926962112211-USATSI-8851072.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7a1cb0f7b5c0156895bcefeab2b62527d0deedf4/c=1477-0-3853-3168&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/635800926962112211-USATSI-8851072.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LohFtI&text=Angry%20Maryland%20coach%20Randy%20Edsall%20walks%20out%20of%20press%20conference&via=usatoday", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LohFtI&mini=true"], "published": "2015-10-11T01:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:13:45.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
