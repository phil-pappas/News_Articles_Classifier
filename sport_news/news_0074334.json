Nikki Haley confirmed the next death during her Wednesday morning news conference.\nGov. Haley urged South Carolina residents to respect barriers and road closures, adding that road closures will be continuously changing. She also urged people to stop removing road barriers.\n\"This is not safe,\" said Haley. \"We're doing this to protect you.\"\nThe body of a man was found Tuesday morning in the 6800 block of North Trenholm Road in Forest Acres, according to the Richland County Sheriff's Department. The Richland County coroner identified the victim as Sampson Antwan Pringle, 30, of Columbia.\nAccording to the South Caroline Department of Public Safety, of the 14 weather-related deaths, eight people drowned, while the other six people died in traffic incidents.\nAs of noon Tuesday, SCDOT reported 469 road closures - 163 of those closures are bridges.\nHaley said Florence, Richland, Marlboro and Horry counties could expect additional evacuations over the next 48 hours as flood waters in the Midlands begin moving toward the Lowcountry.\n\"There are still many, many parts of the state that have washed out roads and flooded roads,\" SCEMD Public Information Officer Derrec Becker said. \"We're not out of this. This is going to continue for several days and even several weeks once the cleanup begins.\"\nHowever, the SCEMD is asking that people continue to take caution when traveling. There are 1,400 Department of Transportation workers making repairs and checking the stability of roads across the state.\nInitial assessments have begun, but the South Carolina Emergency Operations Center is still activated at OpCon1.\nCopyright 2015 WIS.
