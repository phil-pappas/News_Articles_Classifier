It'll be fun just to play them again, because they're a good team, it'll be interesting to see,\" said Kassens , who helped the Patriots win sectional and regional titles in 2013 and 2014. \n\"… (A third straight sectional title) would be awesome. We all want it, so we're all hungry for more sectionals and more regionals, so we're going to push for it.\" \nThe scores of Union County's first two games tell the story of how dominant they were. Game 3 was different. \nThe Falcons battled back from down early on to tie the game at 11 on an ace from Emily White. \nVarious ties followed, and the Falcons took their first lead 15-14 on an ace from Rachel Brumfield. \nBut Union County pulled away, eventually holding to improve to 21-9 on the year. \n\"Union County's a great team,\" Hagerstown coach Brian Dale said. \"To win this sectional, you've got to beat great teams. My kids are looking forward to it. I think it's going to be a great match to be honest with you. I'm so glad to be a part of it.\" \nKassens led with 15 kills and nine digs while Ella Dils had 13 kills, four aces and three solo blocks. \nBailey Jenkins had 31 assists and three aces, Lauren Lester had eight digs, Sydney Bradford had three blocks and three kills and Danielle Hill added five kills. \n\"The difference in the third game was we made a few uncharacteristic mistakes that we hadn't been making of late in Games 1 and 2, and it let the game stay close,\" Union County coach Frank Spurlock said. \"We still had the superior hitters, which ended up making the difference, in Alli Kassens and Ella Dils. So we're pleased with it.\" \nHagerstown had a similar start to Game 1, and Lincoln made a similar comeback in Game 2, but the dominant start came in Game 3. \nThe Tigers scored the first four points, and the Golden Eagles couldn't catch a break. A kill by Kylei Klein was negated by a net violation, and the Tigers led 12-1 before an errant serve finally ended the scoring streak. \nHagerstown defeated Union County 25-17, 25-20, 22-25, 25-22 in TEC play before completing a 7-0 run through the TEC for their first TEC title since 1991. Union County finished second at 6-1, while Centerville was third at 5-2, losing only to UC and Hagerstown. \nHannah Rogers had 13 digs for the Tigers, Aimee Hoodlebrink had 14 and Brytni Dale had nine. \nHoodlebrink had eight kills, Dale had 10 and Rogers 28 assists. \nHagerstown improves to 28-5, matching the school record for wins set last year. \nTo rebreak it, they have to get past the Patriots again. To get to 30, they must win their first sectional title since 1992. \n\"We talked about it a lot, we just want to go play our game, be confident, so that's the goal. We're trying not to be nervous. Obviously, they've very good, but we just want to focus,\" Brytni Dale said. \n\"It's awesome. It was great to beat it last time.\" \nFor Lincoln, Emmie Pugh had eight digs and an ace, Lauren Weston had 14 digs and Maddison Siggers added 13. \nRachel Merida set for 12 assists and Hannah Hall had 10,", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:27:07.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
