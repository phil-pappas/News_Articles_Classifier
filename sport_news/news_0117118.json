They were backed up at their own 7. Two passes from quarterback Kyle Allen to Kirk -- boom, 29 yards; boom, 57 yards -- and A&M found itself sitting pretty at first-and-goal from Arkansas' 7. Kirk also caught the game-winning 20-yard touchdown in overtime and scooted for a 44-yard touchdown in the second quarter.\n\"The kid's got the home-run talent,\" offensive coordinator Jake Spavital said. \"If you look how we were backed up that one drive, we hit two plays in a row and he took it [nearly] 90 yards. You can do a little toss pass and it goes for 45 yards. It's fun to watch. He's very talented, very driven.\"\nAfter Allen, a sophomore, and Kirk have hooked up for big plays this season, TV cameras catch the roommates sitting on the bench together, grinning and rehashing.\nThe Scottsdale, Ariz., natives have known each other going back to their youth football days playing for the Scottsdale Argos, though they played in different age divisions.\n\"He was unstoppable then, too,\" Allen said. \"It's cool that not only are we doing this together on the same team, but we're doing it in a conference that's heralded as the best in the country. And the fact that we live 10 minutes from each other [in Arizona] and we're two of the main contributors on the team. ... Without him, I don't know if we win as many games as we do this year.\"\nAllen takes partial credit for helping recruit Kirk, who falls under coach Kevin Sumlin's rule that prohibits first-year players from speaking with the media.\n\"[Spavital] has always said that [Kirk] was his main guy in that recruiting class,\" Allen said. \"He said 'I don't care if I get anyone else. If I get this kid, we'll be fine.' I think you guys can understand why now.\"\nJason Mohns, Kirk's high school coach at Arizona powerhouse Saguaro, isn't surprised at Kirk's immediate success, but he is impressed.\n\"He was a man among boys at the high school level,\" said Mohns, who attended last week's game at AT&T Stadium in Arlington. \"It's crazy to see him continue to stand out.\"\nKirk (5-11, 200 pounds) starred on varsity for four seasons, including as a freshman, helping the Sabercats to state championships his freshman, junior and senior seasons, finishing his career with a 27-game winning streak.\nKirk links to his high school highlights in his Twitter bio. They're reminiscent of what he's been able to do to a certain extent in the Football Bowl Subdivision. For example, when Kirk made Arizona State players miss in the season opener on a 79-yard punt return for a TD.\nIn high school, one of Kirk's signature plays came while he was on defense as a safety -- \"He never left the field for us,\" Mohns said. Kirk out-jumped a receiver and fellow defensive back and snagged a one-handed interception, then swerved through a crowd 80 yards for a touchdown.\n\"That's all anybody wanted to talk about for weeks,\" Mohns said.\nMohns said Kirk tries to take the approach of a professional athlete.\n\"He approached every day like he was paid millions of dollars,\" Mohns said. \"Every time he's taken the next step, it made him hungrier to be better.\"\nKirk reportedly chose A&M over the likes of Arizona State, UCLA, Southern Cal, Ohio State and Auburn, lured in part by playing in the SEC. He graduated early and enrolled at A&M in January.\n\"His senior year was great,\" Mohns said, \"but he was ready for another challenge.\"\nKirk did finally make a freshman mistake last week, fielding a kickoff and going out of bounds at A&M's 3. Of course, he finished that drive by scoring the 44-yard TD on a catch-and-run.\nSumlin said A&M continues to find ways to involve Kirk, such as lining him up in the backfield. But he said Kirk will also need help from his fellow receivers, including Speedy Noil, also a dangerous return threat, when Noil returns from an undisclosed injury.\n\"I've found it's awful hard for a freshman to play at that level for a complete year,\" Sumlin said. \"He's going to start seeing different coverages. After Game 4 or 5, people will figure out it's not a fluke. He's got some real talent.\"\nThe word on Kirk is already out.\nTwitter: @khairopoulos\nIN THE KNOW Christian Kirk\nSize: 5-11, 200 pounds\nPosition: Wide receiver\nReceiving: 24 catches for 442 yards, 4 touchdowns, 18.4 yards per catch\nAll-purpose yards: 201.3 yards per game, good for No. 5 in FBS and No. 2 in SEC.
