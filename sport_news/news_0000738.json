(Photo: AP) Mumbai: The defense put forward before the court by the Bangladeshi fast bowler Shahadat Hossain in housemaid case has taken everyone by surprise. The cricketer has \"blamed\" his wife (Jesmin Jahan Nritto) for torturing their 10-year-old minor housemaid.\nThis was revealed by Masud Ahmed, the high ranking official attached with the Dhaka Metropolitan Police.\nThe day after Shahadat Hossain surrendered to the court, Masud Ahmed said, \"The reason (to get bail) given by the cricketer was stupid. He has said I am not responsible for my wife's act.\"\n\"I have been busy playing the game, and if the housemaid was really tortured, it was not by me but my wife,\" the 30-year-old right-handed fast bowler, Shahadat Hossain said in the court on Monday.\n\"The couple can not get early bail because media is alert and the court is aware about this fact. The torturing to a minor girl is a very sensitive issue. The crime under Women and Children Repression Prevention Act, 2000 is very strict.\"\n\"This is not the first instance when the same maid was harassed by them. The incident was repeated after 2-3 months when it was first brought to our knowledge. We had tried to pacify the situation then and both husband and wife were persuaded to take care of the girl, but this time, the duo crossed the limit.\"\n\"If they were not happy with this maid, they could have easily removed her and hired someone else.\"\n\"The maid girl was harmed because the baby food prepared by her was very hot\".\n\"The victim is fine now and leading normal life,\" he further added.\n\"Shahadat and his wife have been sent to Dhaka Central Jail where they can't meet each other. There are separate wards for male and female prisoners here,\" the police official concluded.\nAnother Bangladeshi fast bowler Rubel Hossain was also sent to this jail when he was charged for making false promises of marriage to an actress Naznin Akter Happy in January this year.\nThe case was ultimately withdrawn by the actress.\nPages 1 2 next › last » Tags: Cricket Bangladesh Shahadat Hossain Rubel Hossain Also Read Bangladesh cricketer Shahadat Hossain jailed for maid torture Bangladesh cricketer Shahadat Hossain's wife arrested over maid torture Shahadat Hossain suspended for abusing domestic servant Watch: Rubel Hossain’s ‘Happy’ ending busted", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Bangladesh%20Cricket%20Ho_Kand.jpg", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151007/sports-cricket/article/bangladeshi-fast-bowler-shahadat-hossain-‘blames’-his-wife-harassment", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Bangladesh%20Cricket%20Ho_Kand.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T14:33:30.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
