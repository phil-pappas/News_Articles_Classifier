I couldn't come up with anyone else.\"\nNow at Seagoville, Gutierrez can rattle off names of a handful of Latino head coaches in the area. Many of them are friends, such as North Garland's Joe Castillo and The Colony's Rudy Rangel. But the list isn't long.\nA study of 201 public school football programs in the Dallas-Fort Worth area by The Dallas Morning News found eight Latino head coaches, or 3.98 percent of the field. According to the most recent district profiles from the Texas Education Agency, those same schools had nearly 500,000 Latino students from kindergarten through 12th grade, 40.2 percent of the area's student population.\n\"While there's certainly more than when I got here, there's definitely still a huge gap,\" Gutierrez said of area Latino coaches. \"Just look at DISD alone. Of the 22 high schools, probably 19 of them are made up being mostly Hispanic. If there's only two of us in the district, I think it's safe that to say that's pretty shocking.\"\nThere has long been a dearth of Hispanic coaches at higher levels of football; the Carolina Panthers' Ron Rivera, UNLV's Tony Sanchez and Memphis' Justin Fuente are the lone Latino head coaches in the NFL and NCAA's Football Bowl Subdivision right now.\nTexas high school football has shown more inclusiveness for Hispanic coaches -- but not in the hotbeds of the state: Dallas and Houston.\nA decade ago, Jorge Iber, professor of history and associate dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Texas Tech, tallied the number of head and assistant football coaches with Spanish surnames across Texas. His research found that those coaches tended to congregate heavily in \"distinctly 'Mexican' areas of the state\": El Paso, San Antonio and South Texas. For example, 72 percent of the state's Hispanic assistant football coaches were concentrated in districts in those three regions.\n\"Latinos are just simply not ... perceived as being part of the high school coaching fraternity, outside of those areas,\" Iber said last week. \"When the time comes to fill a slot, I don't think schools are looking at as many Latino candidates as they possibly could.\"\nCoaches who do make the jump into areas like Houston or Dallas often tend to move to schools without a recent history of winning -- \"reclamation projects,\" as Iber described them. Of the eight area programs with Latino coaches -- Carrollton R.L. Turner, Fort Worth Castleberry, Fort Worth South Hills, Irving, North Garland, Seagoville, Sunset and The Colony -- only one school made the playoffs in a three-year period before its new coach's arrival (Seagoville, 2010). The three-year record of the schools before the new coach's arrival was a combined 36-173.\nHowever, Irving's Aaron De La Torre was quick to dismiss the idea that coaches can't win at a Latino-majority school.\n\"If anything, I think it gives us a little added motivation to prove them wrong,\" he said.\nIrving, with a student body that is 80.2 percent Hispanic, made the playoffs in De La Torre's second year (2013). Gutierrez has led Seagoville -- 65.3 percent Hispanic -- to the playoffs over the last two seasons.\nNo obvious answer The question of why there are so few Latino coaches in the Dallas area doesn't come with a simple answer.\nNone of the seven Latino head coaches and one director of athletics who spoke with The News -- Castillo, De La Torre, Gutierrez, Rangel, Sunset's Armando Gutierrez, Fort Worth South Hills' J.J. Resendez, Carrollton R.L. Turner's Michael Ramirez and Dallas Independent School District Director of Athletics Gil Garza -- said the lack of coaches was a result of overt discrimination. When asked if they believed their surname had ever played a role in keeping them from being hired, only one coach said yes.\nTheories on the meager numbers were as divergent as the coaches' backgrounds.\nRangel, who grew up in Corpus Christi before moving to Houston as an eighth-grader, said those who break into coaching in South Texas have a tendency to stay there. Rangel started his career in the Houston area, at Bryan and Navasota, as a baseball coach before coming to North Texas.\n\"It's hard to get out of Corpus,\" he said. \"It's just so comfortable that they don't want to leave and come to the 'dog-eat-dog' world up here.\"\nSunset's Gutierrez, a Brownsville native and graduate of Texas A&M-Kingsville, left South Texas directly after college, determined to test himself in the Dallas coaching market. After getting his first job at Rusk Middle School in West Dallas, he found Latino mentors were pretty much nonexistent.\n\"There was nobody in the pipeline for me,\" he said. \"I was going to sink or swim.\"\nIber postulated that because of the closeness of Latino families, sons might be hesitant to pull up stakes and move across the state for a job.\nGarza said many 6A and 5A schools prefer hiring coaches who played college football. Latinos made up only 2.4 percent of Division I college football players in 2014.\nCastillo and Resendez, both of whom played high school football in the area (Castillo at North Garland, Resendez at Haltom), said the hyper-competitiveness of the job market in the Dallas area plays a large role.\n\"The pool of coaches is so, so deep. I've known coaches who've left here to go to the Valley, Corpus, San Antonio, just to find a job,\" Resendez said. \"And that's not limited to a Latino thing.\"\nFor example, R.L. Turner's Ramirez started his career at Irving under Jim Bennett but left for the Valley, eventually becoming head coach at Brownsville Lopez before coming back to the Dallas area.\nCastillo returned to his alma mater, Texas A&M-Commerce, to serve as the school's offensive coordinator before getting his first head coaching job. He was hired at San Antonio Burbank in 2008 by Garza, then SAISD's athletic director. Castillo took the North Garland position in 2012.\n\"If you have a good job, you stay at that job,\" Castillo said. \"And, if most of your networking is in a certain area, it's probably going to be a high probability to stay there just because of the contacts that you have. ... But this is 6A football. There are 245 jobs in the state. And those are hard to get -- period.\"\nSomeone to look up to While Castillo said that he isn't trying to be a flag-bearer for Latino coaches, he stressed the importance of diversity in coaching.\nAll eight Latino-led programs have minority assistant coaches on staff, five of them with Latino assistants.\n\"The first thing about diversity is that the kids get to see the coaches interact with other coaches from different backgrounds,\" Castillo said. \"You want to model that example for the kids. I think you always hire the best coach -- don't get me wrong. You always want to hire the guy who's best going to benefit you, both X's and O's-wise and are they good with kids. But I think diversity is very important. Kids need to see that.\"\nAt R.L. Turner, Ramirez called his staff \"more diverse than most, but that's not out of my trying to do that at all.\"\n\"I'm trying to hire the best guys for the job, and I'd never, ever say that you have to be the same race to have great relationships with kids. When I was a player, I was drawn to a coach not just because he had a similar last name, or similar skin color, but to those coaches that cared about you and showed a desire to help you develop.\"\nYet Ramirez said he \"definitely felt more weight on his shoulders,\" wanting to be a role model for his predominantly Latino team by showing it is possible to become a head coach and a good steward to other Latinos who might want to coach in the area.\n\"It's a responsibility that I feel I certainly have, trying to perform and be successful, in order that you might be able to earn some opportunities for those who come after you,\" he said.\nBecause of the importance of football coaching trees, with a coach's lineage to a great program or great coach a significant factor in hiring, Iber said it might take one or two of these coaches to turn around their current program and \"move further up the food chain\" before any significant growth in Hispanic head coaches occurs in the area.\n\"Obviously, Latinos are woefully underrepresented, but at least there are [eight],\" Iber said. \"At least this is the beginning of the process.\"\nTwitter: @corbettsmithDMN\nOn Twitter:\n @corbettsmithDMN", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/corbettsmithDMN", "http://beta.sportsdayhs.com/", "http://s3.thingpic.com/images/KL/qeHZVnuLuMQovCMcKoHa2h9a.gif#tl-712443858268454914;1043138249&apos;", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/high-school/football/schedule"], "published": "2015-10-18T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T09:30:06.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
