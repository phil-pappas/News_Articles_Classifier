(Armando L. Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) Chicago Tribune Big Ten basketball media day is here, and here's how the teams rank. \nSimple math explains how dominant the Big Ten was last season. \nHalf of the Final Four consisted of teams from the conference, with Michigan State making a surprise appearance and Wisconsin ending Kentucky's undefeated season to reach the NCAA championship game. \nA repeat performance isn't out of the question. \nAs Big Ten media day unofficially kicks off the season Friday at the Chicago Marriott O'Hare, the conference appears just as competitive. Maryland likely will enter the season as a top-five team nationally, and Indiana also figures to be a lock for the preseason rankings. Talented teams at Purdue, Michigan State, Michigan and Wisconsin will make the Big Ten a rough slate for the bottom tier of the conference. \nHere's a look at each team's prospects, in preseason power-ranking order: \n1. Maryland (28-7, 14-4 in 2014-15). Coach Mark Turgeon has developed the Terrapins into an NCAA title contender. Point guard Melo Trimble, a 3-point ace, made the All-Big Ten first team as a freshman and was named the Big Ten Preseason Player of the Year on Wednesday, while senior forward Jake Layman was a third-team pick. Five-star recruit Diamond Stone and transfers Rasheed Sulaimon (Duke) and Robert Carter Jr. (Georgia Tech) add to one of the Big Ten's deepest lineups. \n2. Indiana (20-14, 9-9). Behind senior point guard Yogi Ferrell, the Hoosiers boast one of the nation's most dynamic offenses. James Blackmon Jr. is back from an offseason knee injury, and 6-foot-10 freshman Thomas Bryant is expected to provide a defensive presence Indiana lacked last season. \n3. Purdue (21-13, 12-6). A year ago, the Boilermakers were picked to finish 11th in the conference. Now they're a contender with a deep guard rotation and an impact freshman in Caleb Swanigan. Few can match up in the paint with 7-footer A.J. Hammons, who has led the Big Ten in blocked shots the last three seasons. \n4. Michigan State (27-12, 12-6). A disappointing regular season turned into a Final Four appearance. Everyone has learned never to count out coach Tom Izzo's team. Replacing Travis Trice and Branden Dawson won't be easy, but with Denzel Valentine back and elite shooter Eron Harris eligible after transferring from West Virginia, don't be surprised if the Spartans make another deep run. \n5. Michigan (16-16, 8-10). Hampered by injuries last season, the Wolverines are now one of the most experienced teams in the conference. Caris LeVert and Derrick Walton Jr. return from foot injuries to make up a dangerous backcourt. They join veterans Zak Irvin and Spike Albrecht. \n6. Wisconsin (36-4, 16-2). Yes, national player of the year Frank Kaminsky and fellow first-round NBA draft pick Sam Dekker are gone from last season's NCAA tournament runner-up. Still, sixth may be too low for the Badgers, given that they've never finished below fourth under coach Bo Ryan. Nigel Hayes and Bronson Koenig bring experience from back-to-back Final Fours. You'll know the name Vitto Brown by March. \n7. Iowa (22-12, 12-6). The Hawkeyes return four starters from a team that won its first NCAA tournament game in 14 seasons. Losing big man Aaron White is certainly tough, but senior Jarrod Uthoff may become the Hawkeyes' next leader after ranking second on the team last season with 12.4 points and 6.4 rebounds per game. \n8. Ohio State (24-11, 11-7). Next season should be a huge one for the Buckeyes. This season, they will show glimpses of promise with a stellar five-man freshman class but will work their way through some kinks without D'Angelo Russell and Shannon Scott. \n9. Northwestern (15-17, 6-12). Could Chris Collins' third year in Evanston be THE year? The Wildcats look ever closer to earning a long-awaited first NCAA tournament berth, especially if they get more scoring out of senior guard Tre Demps and senior center Alex Olah. \n10. Illinois (19-14, 9-9). It was another rough offseason for the Illini, who lost veteran point guard Tracy Abrams to injury for a second straight season. Coach John Groce hauled in a strong freshman class, headlined by Jalen Coleman-Lands. Juniors Malcolm Hill and Kendrick Nunn must step into leadership roles if the Illini want to get back to the NCAA tournament after two disappointing seasons. \n11. Nebraska (13-18, 5-13). Remember when the Cornhuskers were everyone's favorite surprise pick last season? They didn't live up to expectations. Now they face little pressure after Terran Petteway and Walter Pitchford turned pro with eligibility remaining. Senior Shavon Shields is tasked with leading a young team looking for an identity. \n12. Minnesota (18-15, 6-12). The Golden Gophers had their chance last season and underachieved. With a lack of experience, there are few expectations for them this season. \n13. Penn State (18-16, 4-14). Guard D.J. Newbill graduated and took with him any hope of the Nittany Lions climbing into the top half of the Big Ten. \n14. Rutgers (10-22, 2-16). The Scarlet Knights ended last season with 15 straight losses and lost three of their four top scorers. Wins will be hard to come by.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:50:29.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
