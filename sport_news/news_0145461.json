He then took over as manager of the club after retiring and guided the club into the Bundesliga for the first time in their history. \n:: He spent seven years managing Borussia Dortmund, winning six trophies - two Bundesliga titles, the DFB-Pokal, and three German Supercups before leaving at the end of last season. That betters the number of trophies won during Ottmar Hitzfeld's successful reign between 1991 and 1997. \n:: Klopp had a hair transplant in 2013 and is unashamedly proud of the results. \"Yes, it's true. I underwent a hair transplant. I think the results are really cool, don't you?\" \n:: An animated figure on the touchline, he once tore a muscle during one over-enthusiastic celebration. \n:: Klopp loves long walks. He often strolls home after matches and even wrote a thesis 'Walking - Inventory and evaluation of a sport for all' while obtaining a diploma in sports science \n:: His methods are both innovative and unorthodox - for last year's Champions League tie against Arsenal he held Dortmund's final training session in Regent's Park. \n:: Klopp is a committed Christian and often discusses his faith in public. \n:: He is such a popular figure in Germany he is credited with turning around the fortunes of car manufacturer Opel after becoming an ambassador for the firm, after which sales of its Insignia model were boosted by 35 per cent in 2014. \n:: Klopp's popularity has also spread to the world of music, where eccentric media personality Matze Knop has released two songs in tribute to the coach called 'I Wanna Be Like Jurgen Klopp' and 'Kloppo You Rockstar'. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
