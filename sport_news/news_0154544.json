The drive ended with a 30-yard touchdown pass from Rainey to running back Russell Halimon for a 20-14 lead. Rainey finished 8-of-12 for 206 yards.“I think we are a balanced team,” Varner said. “We throw that ball when it’s there and teams try to over cheat us. It’s Brandon’s first year playing at quarterback and he just gets better every week. That’s been a big difference. I don’t know if you can over cheat us now.”The Buccaneers began the game with a six-play drive that ended with a 43-yard touchdown run by Rainey.Alexander answered with a 14-play, 72-yard drive that culminated in 1-yard touchdown run from Daetrich Harrington to tie the game at 7-all with 4:29 left in the first quarter. Allatoona regained the lead soon after when Rainey fired a long pass to receiver Brady Eeles for a 60-yard touchdown for a 13-7 lead. Alexander responded again. Facing fourth down, the Cougars faked a handoff and quarterback Baylor Whitfield threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to Justin Hall to retake the lead, 14-13, with 1:15 left in the first quarter.“Guys made mental mistakes in the first half and it took us a little time to find those, so maybe we have to do a better job during the off week preparing,” Varner said.After a Buccaneer punt, the Cougars were again in position to score early in the second quarter with a drive deep into Allatoona territory. However, Faizon Harris intercepted a pass in the end zone to end the threat.After regaining the lead early in the third, the Buccaneers secured the win with two touchdowns — a 27-yard touchdown pass from Rainey and a 4-yard touchdown run from Halimon.Halimon rushed for 145 yards on 25 carries. Eeles led the Buccaneers’ receivers with four catches for 118 yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T10:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:51:02.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
