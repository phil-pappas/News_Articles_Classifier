Pakistan's foreign minister (2002-2007) during General Pervez Musharraf's rule, Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri's book 'Neither a Hawk nor a Dove: An Insider's Account of Pakistan's Foreign Policy' is scheduled to be launched at the Nehru Centre on October 12. The Observer Research Foundation, which is holding the book launch, has sought \"foolproof\" security from Mumbai police for the event.\nIn this regard, ORF (Mumbai) chairman Sudheendra Kulkarni has written to both CM Devendra Fadnavis and police commissioner Ahmed Javed urging them to provide \"adequate security to Mr Kasuri and take firm action against miscreants if they indulge in any unlawful act during his stay in Mumbai.\"\nA power-packed panel discussion featuring, apart from Kasuri, jurist-author A G Noorani, film and theatre actor Naseeruddin Shah and senior columnist Dileep Padgaonkar will follow the book's launch in the city. Its launch in New Delhi on October 8 was attended by, among others, former PM Manmohan Singh and senior BJP leader and former Deputy Prime Minister L K Advani.\nAsked if he fears protests from the Sena over the presence of Kasuri at the book launch function, Kulkarni told TOI: \"We can't take the risk not to seek adequate security, especially when Ghulam Ali has had to cancel his shows.\" ORF has sought police protection for its office at Nariman Point too as Kasuri is visiting it.\nWhile praising the CM for his \"principled stand on the Ghulam Ali affair\", Kulkarni's letter to Fadnavis says: \"Security for an eminent Pakistani dignitary like him (Kasuri) would be necessary even in normal circumstances. However, the need has grown manifold in the light of the recent reprehensible episode in Mumbai, when the Shiv Sena successfully terrorized the organisers of a concert in Mumbai by Ghulam Ali, the famous ghazal maestro from Pakistan, to call it off.\"\nSatish Sawheny, Nehru Centre's CEO, said that he was not worried about the possible protests. \"Every month we hold a discussion on a new book. This is an academic discussion. I am neither jittery nor do I feel anybody should have any objections to holding a book launch and a panel discussion,\" said Sawhney.\nChief minister Devendra Fadnavis had assured adequate security cover to Ghulam Ali for his Mumbai and Pune concerts. He also snubbed the Sena after the concerts were called off: \"It is unfortunate. Why drag culture into Indo-Pak politics?\" the CM had said.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-10T14:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:20:21.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
