Sudfeld, who had both ankles taped, did not move with a noticeable limp in warmups. \nThe status of Indiana's top running back, Jordan Howard, appears to be much more in doubt. Howard, who is also battling an ankle injury, dressed and participated in stretching, but sat out during drills and the team portion of warmups. \nBoth players dressed for last week's 29-7 loss to Penn State, but neither played, so warmups don't provide a definitive answer. But Sudfeld's involvement certainly made it look like he'll be starting for the Hoosiers. \nDan Duggan may be reached at dduggan@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @DDuggan21 .
