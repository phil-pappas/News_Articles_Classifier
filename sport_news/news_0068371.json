(Kevin Richardson/Baltimore Sun) \nIn a meeting with The Baltimore Sun editorial board, University of Maryland, College Park President Wallace Loh talks about the firing of Randy Edsall and what the university will be looking for in a new football coach. (Kevin Richardson/Baltimore Sun) Daniel Gallen Contact Reporter Maryland players comment publicly for first time since Randy Edsall's firing. \nThe dawn of the Mike Locksley era in College Park on Wednesday also provided Maryland players the chance to give their first public comments since Randy Edsall was fired Sunday afternoon. Quarterback Perry Hills, cornerback Will Likely and defensive end Yannick Ngakoue were all made available to share their thoughts as the team moves forward under Locksley. \nAt Ohio State, in Edsall’s final game, Hills started and rushed for 170 yards in the 49-28 loss . He won the starting quarterback job in preseason camp but was benched in Maryland’s second game. Entering the matchup with the top-ranked Buckeyes, Hills was named the starter, and Edsall and Locksley put together a game plan that centered around Hills’ legs. \nWhen asked about Edsall’s status after the game, Hills stressed that the players were playing for each other, and he reiterated that philosophy Wednesday. \n“He was a good coach, and it was kind of a little bit of a shock to us, but it really doesn't matter who's coaching us,” Hills said. “It's all about the players. It's all about us being a family, playing for each other, not the coach. We're just going to move forward and compete our hearts out.” \nEdsall was the first Power Five coach to be fired during the season. On Saturday night, North Texas fired coach Dan McCarney after a loss to Portland State. Illinois, a fellow Big Ten Conference school, fired coach Tim Beckman before the season even started.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:31:48.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
