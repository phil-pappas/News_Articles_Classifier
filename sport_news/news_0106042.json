But that has not stopped his coaching mind from working on the next step – what to do if his former player recovers from the condition that has his life still in jeopardy. Lamar Odom is awake and responding to wife Khloe Kardashian in hospital \n“First of all, we just want him to get better, to get through this and to survive,” Harrick told USA TODAY Sports. “But then we have to look at what comes next.” \nHarrick was contacted by Odom’s estranged wife, Khloe Kardashian, on Friday morning with details that Odom was awake and responsive to communication. \nOdom spent the period from Saturday afternoon until Tuesday at the Love Ranch, a legalized brothel in Crystal, Nev. While there, it is claimed, he took cocaine and up to 10 sexual performance supplement tablets. He was found by brothel staff with blood and white matter coming from his nose and mouth. \nIf Odom has a serious problem with substance abuse, Harrick would not hesitate to act if asked to become part of the solution. Lamar Odom shows signs of improvement with increased heart function \n“He can come and live with me,” Harrick said. “I will look after him. I will take care of him. If he has an illness, we can deal with it, as long as he wants to deal with it. If he wants to be cured, we can do that.” \nHarrick remembers that when Odom arrived at Rhode Island in 1998, he came into the coach’s office with an unusual request. \n“He only wanted one thing,” Harrick said. “He wanted a book bag. He had never had one. He had been this huge high school basketball star in New York since the 10th grade, and that said to me he just wanted to be a normal kid, a normal college student. He got his book bag.” TMZ responds to inaccurate Lamar Odom report \nWhile Harrick stayed in close contact with Odom and says the 35-year-old was “driven up the wall” by the paparazzi, he maintains that Kardashian has been a positive influence. \n“I think she is a great young lady,” he said. “She loves him and he loves her. I hope that Lamar can get through this and they work things out and that their marriage can be a long and happy one.” \nPHOTOS: Lamar Odom through the years", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:09:34.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
