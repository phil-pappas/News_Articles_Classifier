Can't blame this one on a wet field though.Little collision there, and Grace recovers again.This time they're able to capitalize on the turnover.Quarterback Jared Thompson disappears into the pile like rugby. He emerges from five yards out for the touchdown. The extra point attempt was no good, so it's 6-0.In second quarter action; Whitwell's Cody Ingrassia takes the snap, hands it to Jake Sartin, and it's another rugby play.Sartin breaks through the line and rambles 40 yards before Cade Tinsley finally brings him down. Tiger's Greg Layne tosses to Cody Ingrassia, who scampers 10 yards for a touchdown. They go for 2, and take an 8-6 lead.That worked so well, Layne hands it to Ingrassia again, who runs for another 35 yards.But in the end, Whitwell wins 33 to 8.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:55:44.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
