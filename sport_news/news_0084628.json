It will be a very big step forward (if Qatar win) but it will not be decisive.”\nDespite his caution, Carreno’s team only need to win, at most, three of their remaining four matches to progress to the next and most important stage of qualification where 12 teams from across Asia compete for four spots at the 2018 World Cup finals in Russia.\nTwo of those matches come against Group C’s bottom teams, Maldives and Bhutan, who Qatar beat 15-0 in the home fixture.\n Qatar started their campaign with a 1-0 win in Male in June.\nNew Maldives coach Ricki Herbert said his team would not be frightened and had not come just to defend.\n“The game for us tomorrow is very exciting. Qatar are a very good team, a very strong team, it’s a big challenge,” he said. “We will be positive.”\n“Football is full of surprises and hopefully tomorrow we can see another one.”\nHerbert, who played in the 1982 World Cup finals with New Zealand and swapped shirts with Brazilian legend Socrates after their group clash 33 years ago, said he would play several “youngsters”.\nThis includes teenage full-back Samooh Ali.\nThe 19-year-old is a semi-professional who works as a fisherman when not playing football, highlighting the differences in resources between the two sides.\nSuper rich Qatar, ranked 92nd in the world, train in elite facilities while Maldives ranked 176th, have just one pitch back home.\nHosts of the World Cup in 2022, Qatar are seeking to avoid becoming the first nation since Italy in 1934 to do so without ever playing in a finals beforehand.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T14:39:02.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
