(AP Photo/Brandon Wade) More Cowboys Headlines 'Limited' or not, Cowboys' Weeden carrying on as Romo sub \nIRVING, Texas - The Dallas Cowboys are turning to Matt Cassel as their quarterback, according to multiple reports Tuesday. \nBrandon Weeden was told that the Cowboys are going to start Cassel against the New York Giants on Oct. 25 after their bye week. Cassell was acquired in late September from the Buffalo Bills in a trade. \nThe Cowboys (2-3) apparently decided to make the change after their loss to the New England Patriots on Sunday. Weeden started three games after Tony Romo went down with a broken collarbone and lost all three, completing 64 of 91 passes for 666 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions. \nAgainst the Patriots, Weeden passed for a season-low 188 yards and completed 26 of 39 passes with one interception. \nIn Weedenâ€™s last 11 starts as an NFL quarterback, his record is 0-11. \nCowboys coach Jason Garrett said earlier that the team would evaluate the quarterbacks and how to proceed going forward until Romo returns. The broken collarbone will keep Romo out of the lineup until Nov. 22 at the earliest. \nCassel lost a quarterback competition in Buffalo during the preseason with Tyrod Taylor for the starting job.
