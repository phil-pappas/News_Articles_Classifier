Christy Cabrera Chirinos Contact Reporter Sun Sentinel UM, FSU hoping to impress recruits during Saturday's rivalry game \nWhen the Hurricanes take the field at Doak Campbell Stadium on Saturday night, a national television audience will be watching. \nSo will two passionate fan bases that circle the annual Miami-FSU game on the calendar the moment schedules are announced. \nThe Hurricanes and Seminoles are both hoping for impressive performances and a victory in this intense rivalry, however, for a group of top-notch high school football prospects, it can mean even more. \nEach school is hoping some in that select group will be playing in this game in the years to come. \n\"It's a big game, guys. For anybody to sit up here and say it's not a big game…it's a big game in recruiting,\" said Miami offensive coordinator James Coley, one of the Hurricanes' top recruiters and the former FSU offensive coordinator who helped bring former Seminoles quarterback Jameis Winston to campus. \"It's your in-state rival. We see each other on the recruiting trail. I know a lot of people up there. It's a big game.\" \nAdded Hurricanes cornerback Tracy Howard, who was recruited by both Miami and Florida State among several schools: \"I think it has a big impact. A lot of times, kids choose their schools off of who wins this game. That's really true. I don't think that's a good thing, but at the end of the day, that's truly what happens. I've been in the recruiting process, and I know what happens. It's big. It's huge.\" \nFor recruits, there are dozens of factors that go into the decision-making process. Some want the opportunity to play close to home, while others want to experience life outside their hometown. \nOthers look at particular academic programs offered by the schools courting them, while some evaluate how often certain schools send former players into the NFL. \nAnd then there are the relationships players form with the coaches who are recruiting them. \nMiami running back Joe Yearby had, at one point during his recruiting process, verbally committed to Florida State because he wanted to play for Coley. \nWhen Coley left Tallahassee to take over as the Hurricanes' offensive coordinator, Yearby flipped his commitment, eventually signed with Miami and has become the Hurricanes' featured back, rushing for a team-high 424 yards and four touchdowns through Miami's first four games. \nAnd though Hurricanes commit Travis Homer – a running back at Oxbridge Academy – said the results of Saturday's game won't change his decision, he plans to watch. \n\"I don't watch much football, but I'll watch this game,\" Homer said. \"I'm a UM commit and will stay that way, so the result of the game won't change my mind.\" \nAccording to recruiting websites Rivals and 247 Sports, the Seminoles expect to host several top prospects this weekend, including Miami commit and St. Thomas Aquinas wide receiver Sam Bruce, Cardinal Gibbons running back Deon McIntosh, who is the younger brother of Hurricanes defensive lineman RJ McIntosh, and FSU commit Malik Henry, a quarterback prospect from Long Beach Poly Tech. \nWill this one game affect any of their decisions? It's too soon to tell, and with more than 3 1/2 months between now and National Signing Day, other factors could come into play. \nBut both FSU coach Jimbo Fisher and Hurricanes coach Al Golden know a win Saturday wouldn't hurt either of their causes when it comes to impressing young football players, even if there are more important things on the line when the two rivals face each other. \n\"It's important. It's all important — the plan you have for each kids, what you're offering him, the type of young man you're recruiting, whether his values meet your values, and ultimately what's happening on the field. It is important,\" Golden said. \"It's important for us in a lot of different respects, but none of that matters if you don't prepare and keep your eyes focused on what we have to do every day. That will take care of itself, if we play well. That's what we have to do. We have to play well, execute, play with poise, we need leaders to lead and we need to do the things in that game to be successful.\" \nStaff writer Dave Brousseau contributed to this report. \nccabrera@tribpub.com ; On Twitter @ChristyChirinos", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:40:50.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
