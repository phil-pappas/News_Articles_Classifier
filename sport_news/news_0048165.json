So when local businesses Hoosier Mama Pie Co. and Dollop Coffee & Tea Co. teamed up to open an Evanston pie and coffee shop in 2013, the result was, unsurprisingly, sublime. This spacious, pastel-accented spot offers handmade pies both savory and sweet, as well as breakfast pastries, buttermilk biscuit sandwiches, quiches and other delights to accompany the aromatic espresso.\nHowever, the best deal is the Evening Pie Flight ($7.87): a choice of three gooey half slices of Hoosier Mama pie from a rotating menu â€” depending on the day, options include apple, chocolate chess, peanut butter, banana custard, coffee cream or peach blueberry with pecan crumble, to name a few. The flights, served in-house every day after 6 p.m. (also served at Chicago location, 1618 1/2 Chicago Ave., on Friday nights), are ideal for sharing and likely to impress. Because sampling a trio of delicious and disparate pies for less than $8 sounds too good to be true but is in fact foodie-heaven reality. Savor with a hand-warming cup of java (Dollop serves Chicago-based coffee roaster Metropolis) to make the triple taste experience last as long as possible.\n749 Chicago Ave., Evanston, 847-868-8863, www.hoosiermamapie.com/evanston\nPickett is a freelance writer.\nPrivacy Policy Entertainment Dining and Drinking", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561ae0ef/turbine/ct-eat-this-pie-flight-food-1014-20151011", "http://www.hoosiermamapie.com/evanston"], "published": "2015-10-12T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:04:08.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
