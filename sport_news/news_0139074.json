But it won’t be enough to beat the Raiders, who have shined offensively. Can you say 0-4? S eason: 3-0\nRICK TELANDER\nBears 20-19\nBecause I enjoy explosions, I’d love to see The Jimmy Clausen Machine at work again. Alas, it seems we’ll get the old Jay Cutler Show vs. the Raiders. Cutty’s bad hammy may make him more aware of that ticking clock called MY CAREER. Or it may make him throw a key pick very early and be done with it. Season: 2-1\nADAM L. JAHNS\nRaiders 23-20\nQuarterback Jay Cutler, receiver Alshon Jeffery and defensive lineman Jeremiah Ratliff all look like they’ll be playing this week, but it’s difficult picking the Bears to win at this point until they finally do it. The Raiders are a team on the rise. The Bears are a team on the mend. Season: 2-1\nMARK POTASH\nBears 24-20\nThe Bears’ defense showed a little bite with four sacks against the Seahawks and figures to make progress as Vic Fangio’s scheme takes hold. Bears likely will open up the offense no matter who starts at quarterback and with a solid run game should be able to score this week. Season: 3-0\nPATRICK FINLEY\nBears 24-23\nThink the 2008 Lions pop champagne bottles the way the 1972 Dolphins do, but when winless teams take their first game? The Raiders are — believe it or not — competent, but the Bears are dangerous with Jay Cutler, Alshon Jeffery and Jeremiah Ratliff. I bet they play.
