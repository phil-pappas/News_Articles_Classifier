They weren't authorized to comment on the record.\nDNA analysis from crime scene evidence that hadn't been tested before and a fingerprint from the house where one of the victims was discovered all helped investigators narrow the case to Jackson, they said.\nJackson, 55, made his first appearance in court via video from Multnomah County's Inverness Jail since his arrest last week.\nHis court-appointed lawyer entered a not guilty plea on his behalf to aggravated murder charges in the killings of two women and two teenagers, including a 14-year-old girl, in 1983 and 1987.\nRelatives and friends of his alleged victims filled three rows in the courtroom's gallery.\nJackson sat in a room at the jail, wearing a blue jail smock over a pink T-shirt and talking over the phone to his attorney in the courtroom. He often leaned out of view from the video camera.\nNeighbors and family still find it hard to believe he's tied to the killings, they said. Jackson collects disability payments and has lived quietly in a Northeast Portland second-floor apartment for the last 13 years. He told court officials he takes medication for paranoid schizophrenia. He also suffers from congenital heart failure.\n\"I'm just as surprised as anybody else would be,\" his mother, Bernadine Clay, said by telephone as she drove back to Portland from a visit in Texas.\nDetectives found new clues after sending untested evidence from the crime scenes to the state crime lab, said Chief Deputy District Attorney Kirsten Snowden. Newer technology allows forensic examiners to get a DNA profile from smaller samples of evidence than in the past â€“ and that played a role, she said.\nThe forensic evidence as well as the similarity of the crimes helped investigators link the deaths, Snowden and police said. Each of the victims was African American, died of asphyxiation, was sexually assaulted and walked the old Union Avenue, now Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, as a prostitute, they said.\nAn indictment alleges Jackson killed Essie Carrie Jackson, 23, Tonja Nannette Harry, 19, and Angela Dina Anderson, 14, all in 1983, and Latanga Lee Watts, 29, in 1987. Essie Jackson and Homer Jackson are not related.\nEssie Jackson's body was discovered on an embankment at the western edge of Overlook Park on March 23, 1983. She disappeared several weeks earlier.\nHarry's body was found face down in the water near the Columbia Slough in West Delta Park on July 9, 1983. She was last seen getting into a blue pickup truck on Union Avenue the night before her body was found, police said.\nAnderson, 14, was found strangled and partially disrobed in a locked, vacant house on Northeast Going Street, less than a block east of Union, on Sept. 22, 1983. Anderson, who lived in a foster home, was last seen two weeks before her body was found.\nWatts was last spotted on Union Avenue the night of March 17, 1987. Her body was found the next morning in a field next to the north end of the Going Street pedestrian bridge.\nDetectives are continuing to investigate similar unsolved killings of other women around the same time.\nPolice records show a 19-year-old woman was found fatally stabbed in April 1984 under tree branches and down an embankment near an apartment complex on Northeast Multnomah Street. She was last seen along Union Avenue a month earlier, had a young child and was rumored to occasionally engage in prostitution, police said.\nLast week, detectives got a search warrant to collect Jackson's DNA profile, Snowden said. His DNA wasn't in the state's database because his felony convictions for burglary in 1978 and 1983 occurred before state officials began collecting felony offenders' DNA.\nPortland police arrested Jackson on Thursday morning at his apartment and brought him in for questioning on one allegation of aggravated murder. A Multnomah County grand jury issued an indictment Friday morning in all four deaths and Jackson was booked into jail at 11:54 a.m. Friday.\nJackson's family members wondered what had happened to him when he failed to return home.\nJackson has taken medication for paranoid schizophrenia since a 2011 diagnosis, according to court records. He attended school through the 11 th grade.\nHe was shot in the mid-1980s and lost a lung, according to friends and neighbors. He hasn't worked for several years and receives $759 in monthly Social Security checks for his disability. He told court officials that he has used cocaine, but not since about 30 years ago.\nJackson used to work at the Life Center run by his grandmother on Northeast Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, said Joe Jones, who's known Jackson for about 14 years. The center gave out clothes and food to needy people, Jones said.\n\"The guy hardly came out of his apartment. He never bothered anyone, was really quiet,'' said neighbor Rocky Downing. \"We're kind of all stunned. We didn't hear a peep about this. I guess you never really know who people are.''\nDeputy Medical Examiner Dr. Larry Lewman reviewed all the autopsy reports and testified before the grand jury. He said Monday that several of the bodies were badly decomposed by the time they were found.\nAt least five retired Portland homicide detectives and former forensic scientists also were called to testify before the grand jury, including retired Lt. Harry Jackson, who patrolled the former Union Avenue in the 1980s and had contact at least three or four times with Latanga Watts. (He isn't related to Homer Jackson or Essie Jackson.)\nThe lieutenant said he recalled \"chewing her out'' when he saw Watts on the street near Northeast Mississippi Avenue and Skidmore Street, telling her that she needed to be home with her young kids. Older relatives were watching the children, she told him.\nHe saw her three or four times in the two to three weeks before the killing, Jackson said in an interview. During one of the last times he saw her, she wished him well, saying, \"The Good Lord's going to bless you,'' he recalled.\n\"I remembered her. She was a small lady, and I was concerned about her being out there,'' he said. \"It's been kind of a personal thing for me. It's really affected me. I'm glad it's coming to an end.''\nThe women's relatives praised Portland police for not forgetting their loved ones.\n\"We're very excited about how the Portland police cold case detectives pursued this relentlessly, and the new forensic information came out to justify the arrest,'' said Billie Carter, cousin of Angela Anderson. \"We're very grateful.''\nBeverly Nills, Anderson's half sister, said she still felt the loss. \"She was a good kid, but troubled,\" Nills said.\nDonyell Langston, Watts' son, posted a photo on Facebook of himself as a child in 1987 with his mother and wrote after learning of Homer Jackson's arrest: \"Amen!'' \"Me and my mom in 1987 R.I.P Latanga,'' the caption read.\nRolland T. Coleman said in a phone interview that his brother was dating Harry at the time of her death. When Coleman saw media reports of the arrest, he alerted his brother.\n\"He was more angry than relieved because it turned his life upside down, too,'' Coleman said, noting that police had questioned his brother as a potential suspect.\nHomer Jackson is being held without bail. A tentative trial date was set for Nov. 3.\n-- Everton Bailey Jr. of The Oregonian contributed to this report.\n-- Maxine Bernstein\nmbernstein@oregonian.com\n503-221-8212; @maxoregonian", "external_links": ["https://blog.advance.net/cgi-bin/mte/%22mailto:mberstein@oregonian.com", "https://blog.advance.net/cgi-bin/mte/%22https://twitter.com/maxoregonian"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:18:22.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
