CHEROKEE — It was a energy-filled night at Southeast High School as Frontenac volleyball went on the road and rallied after dropping the first set to hand the Lancers a 3-1 loss Thursday evening. “There were a lot of positives coming out of tonight,” Frontenac head coach Cassie Rhuems said. “I thought defensively we made some adjustments late in the night that really benefited us, and our serving was really good for us. We’ve been spending a lot of time on that ... A win is a win, it doesn’t matter how ugly it is.” With the win, the Raiders’ record stands at 15-4 this season. Frontenac pulled out to an early 7-1 lead in the first set before Southeast found their rhythm and battled back and finished with a 25-20 win thanks to a long service run from Bailee Ulery near the end. “We came out aggressive and did a lot of things well and then we just kind of went into coast mode,” Rhuems said. “We kind of stopped communicating, stopped moving our feet and just stopped doing the jobs that we needed to do.” The Lancers’ confidence was high and it showed on the court, fighting tooth and nail with Frontenac over the next three sets. “I think this is one of the most consistent matches we’ve played, with the hustling and the desire that we had,” Southeast head coach Maya White said. “I was happy to see it. Even though we didn’t win, this was a huge improvement from where we’ve been and I hope this is how we continue to play.” The Raiders took the momentum back after back-to-back wins of 25-14 and 25-13 in sets two and three. The Lancers were down but not out, as they came out in the fourth set and looked to find the magic they had in the opener. The fourth set was a grueling game in which both teams traded points as well as the momentum with seemingly every volley. The pair of Crawford-Neosho-Cherokee League teams put everything they had on the court in front of the boistrous crowd. Southeast looked as if they were going to force a fifth set after pulling away with a 23-18 on a Kayln Bitner kill. Just two points from having to play a winner-take-all game, Frontenac’s Lauren Hipfl came up with a kill to force a sideout, giving her Raiders service. “I thought Lauren really put the team on her back,” Rhuems said. “She made a lot of adjustments from the outside. Page 2 of 2 - FHS libero Emily Merando — who had helped lead Frontenac all evening when her number was called — went on a four-point service run to bring the Raiders even with the Lancers at 23-all. “That’s just the player [Emily] is,” Rhuems said. “She hates to lose and nobody would say anything different about that. She was all in it tonight, and did a great job serving for us. The run was highlighted by another Hipfl kill followed by an ace from Merando. Back-to-back attacking errors on Southeast pushed the set even. Bitner earned another kill to put the Lancers up one, breaking the Raiders service and bringing Southeast fans to their feet. The excitement would be short lived as Merando came up huge once against for FHS, finding an empty spot in the Lancers’ back row to force a sideout and giving her team a chance to end it. A kill from Hipfl put the Raiders up 25-24, and Kayla Meyer closed out the 26-24 win in fashion with an ace to send Frontenac home happy. Using a strong night in service to help navigate their way to a Raider win, Fields led the team in service points with 13, while Merando had three aces and 10 total service points and Meyer finished the night with nine service points. Meyer led the team in assists with 39, while Hipfl had a Raider-high 18 kills. Abby Johnson added in nine kills for Frontenac, with Kayla Harper chipping in six. Merando was a force in the back row, digging out 21 balls to lead the Black and White. Hipfl’s 15 digs were good enough for second on the team and Johnson finished third with nine. Even though they took the loss, Southeast has been looking for a match to help change their fortunes this season and Coach White hopes this will be it. “I think it was more of the wanting to change things mentally [that really helped us tonight],” White said. “We’ve been working on the mental part of the game a lot, and just knowing that we can do it. Hopefully, after tonight, they see they can do it and we keep that consistency.” By Lucas Davis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:48:09.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
