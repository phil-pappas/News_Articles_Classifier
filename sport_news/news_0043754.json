One over to go. An upstart bowler. This is typical MS Dhoni territory. But on Sunday, against South Africa in Kanpur, it wasn't to be. In the end, India lost the match — one they seemingly had in the bag — by five runs.\nWorryingly enough, Sunday was not an aberration. In fact, Dhoni has been making a habit of messing up chases with his highly risky 'down to the wire' approach for some time now. Not just that, he's flopping even when armed with the licence to thrill.\nTake India's opening match against Pakistan at the 2015 World Cup, for instance. Or the next one against South Africa. In the first game, at the Adelaide Oval, the scoreboard read 273/3 after 45.2 overs at the time of Dhoni's arrival. India's final score? Well, it was 300/7.\nIn the second, he walked in at No. 6, with a foundation of 269/4 to build on. He had 31 balls to stamp his authority on the game. But India ended up with 307/4. In both games, Dhoni's contribution was 18.\nThese are tough times for Dhoni. Actually, he is a victim of the very high standards he's set for himself. 'Captain Cool', 'Fantastic Finisher'... all that success is coming back to bite him, perhaps.\nDhoni made 31 off 30 deliveries on Sunday. He hit just one boundary. That, too, a risky paddle past short fine-leg. With 11 to get off the last over, bowled by the young Kagiso Rabada, Dhoni came a cropper. Yes, it's a case of a gamble paying off or, in this case, not, but it's time Dhoni did away with this approach. It's fun when you pull off a skydive, not so much when your parachute doesn't open.\nClearly, opposition bowlers seem to have sorted Dhoni out. Even Rabada got it spot on; he didn't give Dhoni any room, targeting his body instead. The 'helicopter' is in the repair bay. That heave, executed by clearing the front foot, is nowhere to be seen. Even that flourishing hoick over long-on has gone missing. You can't win big run chases with ones and twos.\nIt wouldn't be a bad idea for Dhoni to bat up the order — at No. 4 for instance, and ask Suresh Raina to take care of things at No. 6.", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "https://profiles.google.com/101061788010040353388/about"], "published": "2015-10-13T15:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:16:59.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
