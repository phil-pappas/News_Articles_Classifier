It was his first sack of the year, in his first game, after serving a four-game suspension for marijuana use. \nBefore he got up to celebrate, however, he saw teammate Muhammad Wilkerson on the ground with him. Soon, the two were chest-bumping on their way back to the huddle, enjoying the moment. \n“Bittersweet,” Richardson said with a smile after the Jets’ 34-20 victory over Redskins at MetLife Stadium Sunday afternoon. “But I’m glad he got it with me.” \nHe may have to get used to it. The Jets’ defensive line, arguably the best in the NFL, has no shortage of talent. Adding Richardson, the 2013 NFL Defensive Rookie of the year, to the likes of Wilkerson, rookie Leonard Williams, Damon “Snacks” Harrison and Leger Douzable, is simply the rich getting richer. \n“When you got the guys we got up front, give us one-on-ones and we’re all probably going to beat you,” Wilkerson said. “We got so many talented guys up front.\n“It’s good to have him back. He’s only going to help us moving forward.”\nRichardson got the start and appeared in 47 plays, only coming out when the Jets went to their 3-4 package. He had three tackles and split the sack with Wilkerson. The Jets’ defense was stellar against Washington, forcing two turnovers. The run defense held the Redskins to a paltry 34 yards. \n“I did all right, not like I wanted to,” said Richardson, who reported he felt fine physically. “I got back there a couple of times. I just need to get my pass-rushing endurance back up.” \nBefore the game started, Richardson received a few friendly taps on his helmet from the his defensive linemen, who all told him: “It’s time to eat.” \nIt wasn’t quite a steak dinner, his performance, but it was rewarding nevertheless after missing four games for violating the NFL’s substance abuse policy. Richardson also was charged with resisting arrest and multiple traffic violations for allegedly driving 143 mph in July in Missouri, but the trial is ongoing, and he has yet to be further disciplined by the league. \nRichardson said it was hard for him watch the team while he was away — he was allowed to attend team meetings, but not practice until this past week — but that was a distant memory Sunday afternoon. \n“It was a great feeling,” Richardson said. “[We were] out there a little longer than we wanted to be in the first half, but that all changed for us in the second [half].\n“You feel better after a win than a loss, so I feel pretty good.” \nIt was good for Richardson to get the rust off now, with a Sunday afternoon date with the defending Super Bowl champion Patriots on deck, the kind of game he relishes. \n“Our confidence is really high,” Richardson said. “We’re not on no high horse, but you’re supposed to have confidence in yourself, and go out and perform.” \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under muhammad wilkerson ,  new york jets ,  sheldon richardson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:16:45.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
