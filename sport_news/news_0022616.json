(AP) â€” Fanendo Adi scored two second-half goals in the Portland Timbers' 5-2 victory over the Los Angeles Galaxy on Sunday. \nThe Timbers (14-11-8) scored all five goals in a 25-minute span in the second half and moved into a third-place tie with the Vancouver Whitecaps in the West. The Galaxy (14-10-9) conceded the most goals at home since Sept. 12, 2009, in a 6-3 loss to FC Dallas. \nAdi tied it at 1 in the 65th minute with a turnaround left-footed strike from the middle of the box. Three minutes later, he converted from the spot to give Portland the lead for good. \nDiego Chara netted a leaping header to make it 3-1 in the 74th minute. The Galaxy's Robbie Keane closed the deficit in the 84th, but Darlington Nagbe answered with a breakaway goal 18 seconds after the ensuing kickoff. \nKeane gave the Galaxy the early lead in the 36th minute. The Galaxy would have clinched a berth in the conference semifinals with a win. \nMaximiliano Urruti capped the scoring in the 90th minute. It was the Timbers' first road win against the Galaxy. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
