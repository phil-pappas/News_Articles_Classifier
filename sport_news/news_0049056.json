I am expecting a more attacking approach from them and a high tempo match as well, which should suit our style of play,\" he said.\n\"We plan to be resolute in our defence, punish any mistakes they make when they come at us and look to create goal scoring opportunities.\"\nMahamutsa is also not concerned whether the fans would be allowed to attend the game in Suez after reports suggested that a crowd ban might be partially lifted.\nAhly have already asked Egyptian security officials to allow the fans to attend the match but the authorities are still reluctant to do so after more than 20 Zamalek supporters died in a stampede before a domestic league game last February.\n\"From our experiences in the 2013 Champions League Final we know their fans have a strong presence and create a hostile environment at the stadium,\" Mahamutsa added.\n\"But look whether the stadium is empty or full it doesn’t matter to us, we are focused on our game plan and we will fight to make it into the Final.”\nAhly won their eight Champions League title at the expense of Orlando Pirates, defeating them 2-0 in the final in Cairo after a 1-1 draw in the first leg in Johannesburg.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:20:03.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
