Before last week's win over East Carolina, BYU had never come back from a 14-point deficit under head coach Bronco Mendenhall. Now, the resilient Cougars have done it two weeks in a row. That's a first in BYU history.\nAnd while the quarterback and running backs had solid games, the stars of this win were in the trenches. Here's BYU's grades in their win over Cincinnati\nQuarterback \nTanner Mangum had a slow start as he struggled with a hamstring injury he sustained last week against East Carolina. Regardless, he had more yards and touchdowns than Cincinnati's Hayden Moore by the end of the game. Mangum finished with 252 yards passing, two touchdowns and one interception on the night.\nRemember, Mangum is a true freshman. This week, he was a true freshman with a sore hamstring. It is incredible what Mangum has been able to accomplish despite all that.\nGrade: B+ \nRunning back \nThis was by far the best game by BYU's running backs. Algie Brown added 88 yards and two more touchdowns against the Bearcats as he's settled into the feature back role. Francis Bernard and Riley Burt both had runs of more than 40 yards, although Burt's time was cut short due to a hamstring injury. All told, the Cougars rushed for 197 yards and three touchdowns. It was critical for the running backs to help take pressure off Mangum, and they delivered.\nGrade: A- \nWide receiver \nThe wide receivers had a few too many drops against the Bearcats. Mitch Mathews had a rough game with just three catches on the night. The star of the wide receivers was Nick Kurtz, who finished with 119 yards and his first two touchdowns as a Cougar. Kurtz also helped put the offense in a deep hole with a late unsportsmanlike penalty.\nPerhaps not the best night for the Cougar wide receivers, but they did have their moments against the Bearcats.\nGrade: C+ \nOffensive line \nDespite losing two starters, the offensive line did not give up a sack and opened up wide holes for the running game. Mangum had plenty of time to throw despite not being as mobile in this game due to his hamstring injury. The Cougars dominated in the trenches, particularly late in the game.\nGrade: A \nFront seven \nThe Cougar front seven had an incredible game with eight sacks. Bronson Kaufusi led the team with three sacks, while Travis Tuiloma, Sae Tautu, Harvey Langi and Sione Takitaki all got to the quarterback on Friday night. And while they did give up 121 yards rushing, the Cougars shut down the high-powered Cincinnati offense late in the game. The Bearcats had given up just six sacks all season long coming into this game.\nBYU won this game in part because players like Kaufusi went into beast mode in the fourth quarter and stopped Cincinnati's Moore from getting anything done in the fourth quarter.\nGrade: A \nSecondary \nWhile the secondary got torched early in this game, in the end they gave up only 220 yards through the air against one of the most explosive offenses in the nation coming into this game. They struggled with Shaq Washington and gave up several big plays, but they gave up just one touchdown through the air on a trick play.\nBYU returned some starters in this game, and it showed. Kai Nacua looks better back at his natural position at safety, and he made some hard hits on the day.\nGrade: B \nSpecial teams \nBYU had a great day on special teams with a field goal block by Kaufusi, five solid punts for Jonny Linehan with four inside the 20, a field goal for Trevor Samson and a nice 39-yard punt return for Garrett Juergens. Special teams was indeed special in this game.\nGrade: A \nCoaching \nThis was another beautifully called game for offensive coordinator Robert Anae, particularly with a true freshman quarterback with a hamstring injury. It was also a beautifully called game for Bronco Mendenhall and the defense. The coaching staff made great adjustments during the game to stop the Bearcats.\nOverall, this was the best all-around coaching effort for BYU to date this season.\nGrade: A \nOverall \nThings did not look good for the Cougars as they went down 17-3 in the first half. But BYU showed its incredible toughness as it went on a 35-7 run to finish the game. And Cincinnati is no slouch, either. BYU showed a lot of heart in this game and simply out-competed the Bearcats for a solid win in Provo. If this report card depended on the fourth quarter alone, the Cougars would earn an A+. The slow start, drops and penalties take BYU out of A territory, but it was a solid win nonetheless.\nGrade: B+ \nLafe Peavler is a sports strategist for the Deseret News and KSL.com .
