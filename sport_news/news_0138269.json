Denman had a tough go of things two weeks ago when the Scarlet Knights lost to Michigan State, but he turned things around last week and had a good showing as they scored 28 unanswered points to stun Indiana in Bloomington. \nWith things seemingly on the upswing for Denman, now comes the toughest assignment of his college career, slowing down Ohio State junior defensive end Joey Bosa. \nOff 13.5 sacks, Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year and Defensive Lineman of the Year honors last fall, Bosa, a consensus All-American as a sophomore, can single-handedly alter a game. Much of the responsibility of making sure that does not happen sits with Denman. \n\"But J.J. got better last week, and that was part of why we had the success offensively that we did,\" Rutgers head coach Kyle Flood said. \"He knew what he needed to improve on. I thought he worked hard with it with (offensive line) Coach Mitch Browning during the week, and I think it showed up on Saturday. And now he's going to play against what might possibly be the best player in college football. \n\"He's a tremendous player. As live a body on film as I've seen. Everything he does is explosive. So if you're just a little bit off from a technique standpoint, you're going to be in trouble.\" \n\"He's maturing into a veteran player,\" redshirt junior right guard Chris Muller said of Denman. \"He realizes what he has to do, and he realizes he's not young anymore. He's coming into his own, and the offensive line is probably the hardest position to mold over time. It's finally clicking for everyone on the offensive line.\" \nIf Denman is having trouble with Bosa, Muller moving over is an option to try to deal with him. Last season in Ohio State's 56-17 win over Rutgers in Columbus, Bosa had two of his 13.5 sacks and two tackles for a loss. In six games this season, Bosa has 27 tackles, 18 of which were unassisted; nine tackles for a loss; nine quarterback hurries; and three passes defensed. \n\"Coaches feel he demands attention, so we've got stuff to handle him, to make sure we do our job against him,\" fifth-year senior left tackle Keith Lumpkin said. \"It's a great matchup for whoever's on him, me or J.J. if he lines up inside, which he does a little bit. We've prepared for it, we know what to do, we just have to go out and execute.\" \nBosa may be the shining star of the Buckeyes' offensive line, but he isn't alone. Defensive tackles Adolphus Washington and Tommy Schutt are both seniors with a combined 80 games of experience. Defensive end Tyquan Lewis may be just a sophomore, but the Tarboro, North Carolina, native played in all 15 games as a true freshman last fall when the Buckeyes went 14-1 and captured the first-ever College Football Playoff national championship. \n\"They have a lot of upperclassmen, a lot of experience, a lot of guys that have played a lot,\" Lumpkin said. \"They're active, they fly to the ball, so it's going to be a good challenge to the guys up front. \n\"All of them stand out. They all play hard. Bosa's a good player, but they're all good players. Everybody stands out. This is one of those games where you have to play your best.\" \n\"Joey Bosa is an incredible player; they're all incredible players,\" Muller said. \"Someone like Adolphus Washington doesn't get enough credit. They're all incredible players. They have an extraordinary coach, and they're going to be a real fun challenge to play against.\" \nStaff writer Josh Newman: jnewman4@gannettnj.com 1 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1LMbsYY TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:24:05.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
