I really did. I wanted to scream about “human sacrifice” and “dogs and cats living together” because, well, Bill Murray, and, because, well, “Ghostbusters,” but college football isn’t experiencing chaos. Not yet anyway.\nSure, four of the top eight teams in the country lost last weekend, but this doesn’t qualify as “mass hysteria.” This is media hysteria. This is self-created drama. This is the result of maintaining preseason rankings when more than a month has passed. This is the result of power programs playing legitimate opponents rather than handing small schools a giant check.\nThis is five weeks into a season and more “chaos” will come — even for the Big Ten, which once appeared so predictable. Ohio State was the undisputed favorite to repeat as national champions. Michigan State was the lone team believed capable of keeping the Buckeyes from the playoff.\nBoth remain undefeated and ranked among the top four teams in the country, but neither even looks like the best team in their conference. While the Buckeyes still appear hung over after last season’s unexpected celebration and the Spartans appear incapable of seizing control of any game, while Michigan becomes more impressive every week.\nComing off a five-win season, Jim Harbaugh’s khaki-flavored elixir has transformed the Wolverines unfathomably fast. Since Jake Rudock was intercepted three times in a seven-point, season-opening loss at Utah — undefeated and ranked fifth in the nation — Michigan has won four straight games by an average of 27 points, including shutouts of BYU and Maryland the past two weeks.\nOhio State still has more talent. Michigan State does, too. But what may end up being most important is the consistency the new coach already has ingrained in his alma mater. And it should only get better, continuing with a Michigan (-8) home win over Northwestern.\nWashington (+16½) over USC: Weird things happen on Thursday nights — they just do.\nVIRGINIA TECH (+1) over North Carolina State: Reminder, the Hokies were down 21-17 in the third quarter and in Ohio State territory when quarterback Michael Brewer left with a broken collarbone. Now, it looks as if the senior will be back, saving Virginia Tech from another outing like the 91-yard, three-interception it got from Brenden Motley in last week’s loss to Pittsburgh. \nSouth Carolina (+18½) over LSU: Leonard Fournette is worthy of all the praise, but his teammates haven’t done enough to prove they belong on the same field.\nKANSAS (+44) over Baylor: The line is absurd, but appropriate. In similar situations the past two seasons, the Bears won by an average of 45.5 points. When in doubt, take the massive amount of points. \nTexas (+16½) over Oklahoma: The Longhorns’ two embarrassing efforts this season — against Notre Dame and TCU — both came on the road. With half of the Cotton Bowl’s support, Texas should again bring out one of its best performances of a disappointing season in the rivalry game.\nOHIO STATE (-32½) over Maryland: The Buckeyes have gone four straight games without covering. For at least one week, expect the champs to rediscover their Steve Serby swag. If not now, maybe never.\nCLEMSON (-6½) over Georgia Tech: The Yellow Jackets’ struggles will only get worse against one of the nation’s best run defenses, with their inability to successfully adopt the most important part of modern offenses (See: passing) resulting in a fourth straight loss. \nArkansas (+16) over ALABAMA: Nick Saban, why so sensitive? After beating Georgia, the Alabama coach called out everyone for saying his team was, “six feet under, dead, buried and gone.” Really? Was being the favorite in every single game for more than five years not enough belief in your boys? Was being a two-point underdog on the road against a top-10 team that insulting? Congratulations. Everyone believes in you again. Now, let’s see what happens when all that easy motivation evaporates. \nNavy (+14½) over NOTRE DAME: The Fighting Irish had success slowing Georgia Tech’s triple-option attack, and Keenan Reynolds and the undefeated Midshipmen’s third-ranked rushing offense also will keep it close all game, just as they have in the past two seasons’ losses by a combined 14 points.\nKANSAS STATE (+9) over Tcu: This is until the Wildcats lose another quarterback before kickoff.\nMISSOURI (+5) over Florida: “I’m kind of interested to see if our team is a one-hit wonder,” Florida coach Jim McElwain said this week after the home upset win over Ole Miss. “It’ll be really interesting to see how we handle the praise from all the people that obviously said they weren’t worth a hill of beans and now are talking about them.” Even the rising star can’t protect his kids from a letdown.\nFLORIDA STATE (-9) over Miami: Dalvin Cook’s shaky status makes the Seminoles a tougher play, but the Jalen Ramsey-led defense remains a certainty to show up for a sixth straight win over Miami.\nMichigan State (-14) over RUTGERS: Rarely do I advocate taking a double-digit road favorite, but rarely do you need just two touchdowns from a potential playoff team against a team that has the potential to never see what the top of its conference looks like.\nUTAH (-7) over California: All undefeated teams are not created equal. While Cal quarterback Jared Goff may be the best NFL prospect in the game, the Golden Bears aren’t ready for the spotlight yet, following a string of narrow wins over mediocre teams.\nBest bets: Ohio State, Clemson, Arkansas \n2015 record: 40-33-2; Best bets: 7-7-1\nLast season: 139-122-2\nFollow @HowieKussoy on Twitter for additional picks \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under bettor's guide ,  college football ,  pigskin profit", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:40:00.711+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
