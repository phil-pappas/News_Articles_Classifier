GRAVES October 13, 2015 2:02 pm \nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Louisville coach Rick Pitino remains defiant that his program will survive the allegations in a book by an escort alleging that former Cardinals staffer Andre McGee hired her and other dancers to strip and have sex with recruits and players. \nPitino said Tuesday that the Cardinals “will get through this the right way.” \nThe coach told a packed room at a tipoff luncheon that he understands the motivation behind Katina Powell’s book “Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen,” but questions the need for the alleged activities given the talent his program has produced. \nPitino added, “We will find out the truth, whatever it may be, and those responsible will pay the price.” Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:04:28.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
