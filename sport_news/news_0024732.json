I think we’re trying to add more to the Homecoming week since this community is so dedicated to Manitowoc Public Schools we want to make it even more of a feel-good event.” \nThere’s an added benefit to moving the event, Steavpack added. \n“Ships don’t lose Homecoming games and to have this event on Homecoming Saturday with a football team playing at 1 p.m. Ron’s in the house,” Steavpack said. “The field is named after Ron, the running event is named after Ron. It’s great to have his family here. This event needs to be on a football gameday.” \nClass of 1996 graduate Steve Walsh couldn’t agree more. \n“Being an alumni and being a former football player Coach Rubick had a huge impression on my life,” Walsh said. “It’s one of the reasons I became a Phys Ed teacher so for us to be able to be apart of the Homecoming celebration is great for the community. It’s a way to make the run that much more special.” \nWhat makes the Rubick Run so important to the community is not what the coach did for the football team but what he did for Lincoln as a whole Walsh says. \n“Everyone knows about the X’s and O’s and the game of football,” Walsh said. “He was more influential in the game of life. He taught you how to be a good person, a good human being, a good father, a good teacher, a good coach. It wasn’t him forcing it down your throat saying you had to do this, he led by example. Those kind of people you can learn from.” \nWalsh added Rubick supported all Lincoln athletics, not just his own team. \n“Coach Rubick was at every event whether it was baseball or tennis or anything else,” Walsh said. “It might have been inconspicuous, you might not have known he was there but a little comment in the hall like nice hit at the baseball game last night or way to come through in the last game of your tennis match. He saw it and those little comments proved her cared more about the kids than just from 7:30 to 3:30 when he was in the classroom.” \nRace director Dave Nickels said while there were a lot of positives with the date change only about 120 runners took part. \n“The feedback I got in changing the date was real positive,” Nickels said. “This is something we’re going to continue to do. It ties in real well, the parade has been moved to Friday night so it allows us to make it a two-day event. We’re not concerned with a large number just making sure everyone who participates has a good time.” \nWhile the overall numbers were down, Walsh is confident the community and his fellow alums will embrace the new date. \n“I think in the long run there’s a lot of potential for the positives with bringing it in with Homecoming,” Walsh said. “It’s an event people do come back for and it’s not about running a race it’s about honoring a man who was such an icon in this community for so many years.” \nWinning the 5K race was Kory Richardson with a time of 18:46. The top female finisher was Lona Werner (20:47). \n(Top three finishers per age group) \nMen \n14 and under — 1. Bailey Maxwell, 19:18; 2. Owen Schmitt, 19:40; 3. Jack Schultz, 19:48; 15-19 — 1.
