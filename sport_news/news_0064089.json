One year ago, the B-Sens season ended a week or two earlier than it had in Richardson's previous two years, but despite the frustration, it was a learning experience. \"It was disappointing not to be in the playoffs, but I think we stayed strong as a group. For coaches, it's easy to get frustrated and for the young players, we really stuck with them and I think they responded realizing that and took it to the next level and played great hockey,\" Richardson said. \"It was a little disappointing not to be in the playoffs because we knew at that point in the year we were able to compete with them but we didn't have that opportunity. But it's a good growing experience for myself and the players to realize that you have to be prepared at the beginning of the year as a team and have a real good plan in order because you can't fall far behind because it's real hard to catch up no matter how good you're playing in March.\" The B-Sens open the season on Saturday at home against Albany.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:35:39.373+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
