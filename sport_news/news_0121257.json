THE MAVERICKS ARE NOW ENTERING A TOUGH THREE GAME STRETCH, AND THEY KNOW EACH GAME IS IMPORTANT TO THEIR FUTURE. \"Try to take it one game at a time and whoever the opponent is we just try to play our best.

They have played well on the road and they are learning how to travel and they are getting better and better at it each week. They've really developed an attitude over here and its a good one\" said Princeton head coach Wes Eddy. \nTHE TIGERS WILL BE LED BY THE THREE HEADED MONSTER OF JORDAN JONES, ZACH STADNIFUR, AND KEVIN PHILLIPS, WHO ARE ALL CAPABLE OF HAVING A BIG GAME. \"We've heard about that but we go into each game with the same composure of getting a win and blocking for each other. Its mano e mano out there and doing work together\" said senior Jordan Jones. \nTHIS GAME WILL MEAN BIG BONUS POINTS FOR EITHER SIDE, AND A LOT OF MOMENTUM GOING THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE SEASON. \"I tell them every night, that is game coming up is the biggest we've had all year. If they continue to look at it that way and continue to play that way then hopefully we'll do well in the end\" said Mustain. \"We are definitley excited. They have a great football team and we are going to show up and play. They are a phenomial team, they are 6-0 and we want to show them what we are about\" said Princeton junior Zach Standifur Game of the Week: Princeton and James Monroe prepare for physical battle Linside, WVWVVA-TVJAMES MONROE IS SITTING AT 6-0 RANKED THIRD IN CLASS DOUBLE A.
