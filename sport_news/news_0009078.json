They ran one of those trick plays — an attempt at a fake punt — where everyone lines up wide and they just leave the center and a player to take the snap — but didn’t seem to have much of a plan after that.\n“It turned out to be one of the worst failed fakes probably of all time,” Indianapolis punter Pat McAfee said.\n HERE.\nAJ Mast/AP What were they thinking? Colt Anderson is tackled a gang of Patriots after the Colts snapped the ball on a bizarre fake punt formation Sunday night.\nTrailing 27-21 in the fourth quarter, the Colts brought the punt team out on fourth-and-3 before shifting most of their players near the right sideline. Pagano was hoping to draw the Patriots into a mistake. Instead, receiver Griff Whalen inexplicably snapped the ball to safety Colt Anderson, who was immediately tackled for a 1-yard loss.\n“The whole idea there was on fourth-and-3 or less, shift our alignment to where you either catch them misaligned, they try to sub some people in, catch them with 12 men on the field and if you get a certain look, you can make a play,” Colts coach Chuck Pagano said. “Alignment-wise we weren’t lined up correctly, and then a communication problem on the snap. I take responsibility for that.”\nHere is the Colts' bizarre formation. Six plays later, Tom Brady, working with a short field from the Colts' 35, found LeGarrette Blount for an 11-yard touchdown to put the Pats up by two scores, 34-21.\nBill Belichick, of course, was ready for it.\n“We expected this to be a gadget game,” coach Bill Belichick said. “Their punter ran a sweep against Tennessee a couple weeks ago, so that’s something they’ve done in the past.”\nThe Colts have had the tricky formation in their playbook for a year, but picked an inopportune time to use it.\n“Obviously, it was not ideal,” Colts quarterback Andrew Luck deadpanned.\n— With News Wire Services\nMOBILE USERS: SEE THE COLTS ODD PLAY HERE\nRelated Stories Patriots, Tom Brady get Deflategate revenge on Colts Mehta: Jets using same formula as successful 1998 team Isola's Gridiron Grate: NFL picking on Peyton Manning Tags: indianapolis colts", "external_links": ["http://images.performgroup.com/namedImage/12637/install_flash.gif", "https://vine.co/v/e9gIULgbAle", "http://static.eplayer.performgroup.com/flash/js/swfobject.js", "https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports", "http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer", "http://static.eplayer.performgroup.com/flash/js/performgroup.js"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T15:50:52.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
