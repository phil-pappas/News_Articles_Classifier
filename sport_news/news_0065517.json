(GENE J. PUSKAR / AP) Mark Wogenrich Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call James Franklin calls Ohio part of Penn State's recruiting 'footprint.' \nBefore his first trip to Ohio State, James Franklin made a point to pitch Penn State's recruiting strategy against its top-ranked rival. \nFranklin last week called Ohio part of his team's recruiting \"footprint\" and said that Penn State must be more aggressive in recruiting the state. That he made the statement before Penn State visited top-ranked Ohio State on Saturday night was no accident. \n\"If you look back historically at Penn State, we've had some great players from the state of Ohio,\" Franklin said. \"So that's something that we're obviously looking at and want to do a better job there.\" \nPenn State has recruited Ohio heavily over the years, drawing players such as Ki-Jana Carter, Curtis Enis, Daryll Clark and Michael Zordich from its neighbor. Currently, the Lions have one player from Ohio on their roster: redshirt freshman lineman Chance Sorrell. \nFranklin said last week that \"shocked\" him. Penn State has one player, lineman Alex Gellerstedt, committed to the 2016 recruiting class. The coach wants more. \n\"It's an area that we would consider in our footprint,\" Franklin said. \"â€¦ We want to make sure that we're continuing to do a good job there.\" \nINNURY UPDATES: Penn State returned several injured players against Ohio State, notably running backs Saquon Barkley and Akeel Lynch and tight end Adam Breneman. \nA redshirt sophomore, Breneman hasn't been in uniform for a game since the season-finale against Wisconsin in 2013. When he caught three passes for 78 yards and a touchdown. Breneman took a medical redshirt last season and did not play in Penn State's first six games of 2015. \nBarkley and Lynch returned to the lineup after missing the past 21/2 games with an injury. Both he and Lynch were injured in the second quarter against San Diego State. Lynch, wearing a knee brace, started for the fifth time this season. \nOthers returning included center Angelo Mangiro, who did not play last week, and punter/holder Chris Gulla. \nTight end Kyle Carter did not make the trip. \nFIELD REPLACED AT BEAVER STADIUM: Penn State's Beaver Stadium could be renovated, or even replaced, at some point. In the meantime, the field of the world's third-largest stadium is getting a necessary makeover. \nPenn State is replacing the stadium sod, which has served as the Nittany Lions' playing surface for a decade. But five consecutive home games, three of which were played in the rain, prompted a re-sodding of the field considered among the best in the country. \nThe four-day replacement project concluded Friday, and the field is expected to be at its peak for Penn State's next home game against Illinois on Oct. 31. \nBeaver Stadium's turf has been replaced rarely over the past four decades: the last time was prior to Penn State's 2005 game against Ohio State. \nAccording to Penn State, about 70,000 square feet of sod will be used at Beaver Stadium and its on-campus nursery. The Kentucky bluegrass came from a New Jersey turf farm. \n\"It's going to be like one magic carpet, in the sense that it is going to knit together and it's going to be stable,\" Herb Combs, Penn State's athletic field supervisor, said in a statement. \"And it will provide the same surface everyone is accustomed to seeing.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:10:58.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
