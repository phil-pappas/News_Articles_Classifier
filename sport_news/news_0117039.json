It's not at the top of news websites. It's not what everyone is posting about on Facebook.\nAfter a weekend of football or autumn apple picking, with eyes toward the workweek and baseball playoffs, those who don't live right there, those who didn't lose someone, forget, because what good does it do to remember?\nIf our pattern holds, Oregon becomes just a name on a list of mass shootings, and we can imagine a conversation the next time innocents are gunned down:\n\"Gosh, how many of these shootings have there been?\"\n\"Well, there was Sandy Hook and Louisiana.\"\n\"Yep, then those reporters in Virginia.\"\n\"That was awful. I feel like there was another recent one.\"\n\"Oh, Oregon. That college in Oregon.\"\n\"That's right. That was so terrible.\"\nIt just becomes part of the blur. It never stops, we tell ourselves. When will this country do something about these killings, we complain.\nAs with past shootings, the plume of outrage over the Oregon massacre was swiftly dispersed on the wind of rote excuses. It's a mental health problem. The National Rifle Association is just too powerful to fight. What gun law would've stopped this?\nOregon shooting v. Planned Parenthood and the debate over life Rex W. Huppke Here are a few facts:\n• Yesterday, a little more than a month after the nation watched two journalists get shot to death on live television, a little more than three months after a man killed two people and wounded nine others in a Louisiana movie theater, a 26-year-old gunman killed nine people...\nHere are a few facts:\n• Yesterday, a little more than a month after the nation watched two journalists get shot to death on live television, a little more than three months after a man killed two people and wounded nine others in a Louisiana movie theater, a 26-year-old gunman killed nine people...\n(Rex W. Huppke) It is a mental health problem. Why aren't we doing more to address that?\nThe NRA is powerful. That doesn't mean we should give up.\nWhat gun law would've stopped this? That's a near-impossible question to answer, as the shooter's personal history remains foggy. It's also a dodge — it's saying, \"Well, gosh, there's nothing on the books that would've stopped this from happening so there's nothing we can do.\"\nThe shooter had five handguns and a rifle at Umpqua Community College and two pistols, four rifles and a shotgun in his apartment, all purchased legally by him or members of his family. That alone suggests something must change. Nobody needs an arsenal.\nIs it more thorough background checks, longer waiting periods, limits on the number of guns a person can own? Is it lifting the nearly 20-year-old ban that prevents the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from researching gun violence and perhaps finding some sensible solutions?\nI don't know. But I would ask this: If you knew before the Oregon shooting that just one of those changes would cut the risk of a mass murder by even 0.001 percent, would you make that change? And if you wouldn't, would you face the families who lost children and friends last week and tell them why you didn't try something, anything?\nWe aren't beholden to the victims of this tragedy so much that our lives should be consumed with finding a solution.\nBut before the shock waves of Oregon are gone completely, perhaps we can do something more than shake our heads. Perhaps we can fight back the urge to say, \"Nobody's going to listen.\"\nYou can find email addresses and snail mail addresses for your senators and representatives in Congress by entering your address into this website: www.opencongress.org/people/zipcodelookup .\nAnd you can consider sending each of them this note:\n\"I refuse to accept that there is nothing this country can do to stop gun violence.\nI refuse to believe that school shootings are the new normal.\nI won't listen to empty rhetoric or accept that the only path to safety is to arm myself and my children and their teachers and their bus drivers and the ticket-takers at movie theaters and the security guards in every public place.\nI expect my elected officials to work at making the world a better place, and while there are other issues that demand your attention, I expect gun violence to be high on the list.\nTo that end, if you want my vote in the next election, I ask the following:\n•If you blame mass shootings on the country's flawed mental health system, take concrete steps to address that system.\n•If you blame mass shootings on lax gun laws, take concrete steps to push for comprehensive laws that might make a difference, and don't be cowed by voices that say such advocacy is politically risky. You're there for a reason. Do something.\n•If you think you only need to consider one of those two items above, stop being naive. This isn't a one-solution issue. Work on mental health. Work on gun laws. Work on everything that might be even tangentially related to the problem that is costing us an absurd number of innocent lives.\n•Lift the ban that keeps the CDC from researching this issue. Open the door to extensive research and let political decisions be driven by concrete data. Don't shy away from a full understanding of this issue by parroting pro- or anti-gun talking points.\n•Stop taking money from the NRA. Stop listening to the NRA. Stop treating the NRA like a legitimate organization. The NRA cares about one thing: gun sales. Use your head. Don't be bullied.\nI don't expect you alone to fix this problem. It will take cooperation and compromise, and time. But, if you want my vote, I do expect you to do one thing: something.\nBecause we've been doing nothing for long enough.\"\nI know a letter isn't much. But it's a start.\nAnd before Oregon fades into that blurry list of tragedies, before we forget how many died and when it happened, don't we owe those nine people something?
