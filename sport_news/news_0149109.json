They’re going against the top teams close to them in the District 32-6A volleyball standings. \nSaturday marked the first of those three matches, and it went well for the Los Fresnos girls at home as they remained unbeaten in 32-6A with a 25-9, 25-11, 25-13 triumph over Rivera. \nThe Lady Falcons (28-8, 5-0 district), ranked No. 2 in the Rio Grande Valley, next play at No. 6 Brownsville Veterans Memorial (22-10, 5-0) on Tuesday and then play host to No. 9 Hanna (20-11, 4-1) on Saturday. Even with Saturday’s loss, Rivera (16-17, 3-2) remains among the top four teams in the 32-6A standings. \nAlthough it was close early in each game, the Lady Falcons never really appeared to be threatened by the Lady Raiders during Saturday’s contest. \n“We need to take care of business every match,” Los Fresnos coach Becky Woods said. “This is our crucial district stretch right here. There are two matches to go for us before the end of the first round, and they’re against Veterans and Hanna. We’ve definitely got to come out and take care of business. \n“That’s why I let my starters stay in there and keep playing today,” Woods added. “We’ve got to be ready Tuesday and then again on Saturday. The more hits they can get, the better off we’re going to be.” \nRoy Hess covers sports for The Brownsville Herald. You can reach him via email at rhess@brownsvilleherald.com .
