If he was a doubt that he could not start then he wouldn't. \n\"We know there is a lot at stake but we would not risk him. He is fit to start, but I am not sure he is fit enough for 90 minutes. \n\"We will monitor how it goes as we have two games in four days, which is tough, so he is unlikely to play 90 in both. \n\"But he has looked good in training and we have had no limits on how long he is able to play.\" \nBosnia have been beset by problems with doubts remaining over Edin Dzeko, who injured a calf two weeks ago. \nDzeko trained on Friday but the Bosnia coach Mehmed Bazdarevic admitted he did not know whether the Roma striker would be fit enough to play against Wales. \nEverton midfielder Muhamed Besic is suspended after being sent off against Andorra last month and Tino-Sven Susic misses out through injury. \nWales captain Ashley Williams would have to mark Dzeko but he said his only focus was on the team's performance, and not who he could possibly be coming up against. \n\"Our focus is on ourselves as always,\" Williams said. \n\"We want the game to come but it's important to enjoy it. We've worked so hard for it and we're anxious to get on the pitch. \n\"The lads are not scared at all, they have been like that all campaign. There will be no fears and we're not unsure what to do, and with that comes confidence. \n\"As a squad we've gained a lot of caps playing in all kinds of games and we can definitely draw on that experience. \n\"It's nice when you look around the team there's a lot of experience around you.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:01:50.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
