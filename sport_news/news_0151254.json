That was followed by a similar call from fast food giant McDonald's and financial services giant Visa. \nThe intervention from the major sponsors come a week after the 79-year-old Swiss was placed under criminal investigation by Swiss authorities for alleged financial wrongdoing at FIFA, which he has led since 1998.
