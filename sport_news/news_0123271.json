Joboo’s Pick: Mt. View-Liberty – Liberty wins the games they’re supposed to. This could be the best defense the Eagles have had in the recent past. They’re certainly the most consistent. Houston at Strafford Jordan’s Pick: Strafford – This has the potential to be an upset and Houston has played a brutal schedule. I don’t expect many points, but Strafford being at home helps. These two also have playoff history. Joboo’s Pick: Strafford – Remember how we were writing Strafford off after their 1-3 start. Now the Inidans have won 3 of the last 5 and lost to Fair Grove and Skyline by a total of 10 points. Ash Grove at Diamond Jordan’s Pick: Diamond – I went back and forth and this one. Two first-year head coaches in Ryan Long and Ben Glidewell that have made an instant impact on their program with an opportunity to make a district run. Ash Grove has played a tougher schedule, but there’s just something about this Diamond team that I like. It’ll be close, but I think the Cats win. Joboo’s Pick: Ash Grove – Here’s a 4/5 upset special for you. I like where Diamond is going, but Ash Grove has shown they can play some good ball. I think they win a low-scoring game. Willow Springs at Fair Grove Jordan’s Pick: Fair Grove – Getting that two seed is nice. Willow won’t be a pushover, but Fair Grove should win. Joboo’s Pick: Fair Grove – After losing to Marionville and Ash Grove, the Eagles rebounded well last week. That should carry over for this game. District 4 - CLICK HERE FOR THE BRACKET Sherwood at Lamar Jordan’s Pick: Lamar – People will say Lamar ran the score up, but Scott Bailey has to get his starters at least two quarters of work at this point of the season. Unfortunately, the Tigers could score 100 if he did that. Joboo’s Pick: Lamar – Tigers. Done. Moving on. El Dorado Springs at University Academy Jordan’s Pick: El Dorado Springs – Have you seen Lance Molz lately? Kid has been on a tear, the Bulldogs follow his lead. Joboo’s Pick: El Dorado Springs – Give me the Bulldogs in another 4/5 upset. They lost to UA by 10 over a month ago, but I’m going with a hunch here. Stockton at Butler Jordan’s Pick: Stockton – You ever get one of those weird feelings about a game? While it could be the Taco Bell I just ate, it’s hard to beat a team twice. Garrett Burns gets hot, Stockton shocks Butler. Joboo’s Pick: Butler – Butler beat Stockton 55-35 just 3 weeks ago and played 8-1 Summit Christian tough last week. VIDEO: In the Zone - District Football Preview CLASS 3 Warsaw at Mountain Grove Jordan’s Pick: Mountain Grove – This will get ugly in a hurry. Joboo’s Pick: Mountain Grove – The Panthers have struggled a bit the last month, but they should be fine against Warsaw who is averaging less than 8 points per game. Catholic at Osage Jordan’s Pick: Osage – Osage got hot and won the district last year and the same opportunity is available this year. Joboo’s Pick: Osage – The Irish have shown some life the last 5 games, but Osage is better than their record would indicate. St. James at Salem Jordan’s Pick: Salem – St. James doesn’t like play defense. The Tigers will pound them offensively. They are the district darkhorse. Joboo’s Pick: Salem – St. James seems to alternate between good & bad weeks. They’re due for a bad one and Salem will capitalize. Buffalo at Ava Jordan’s Pick: Ava – The Bears have picked it up lately, that should continue here. Joboo’s Pick: Ava – With Mountain Grove looking a bit off, you have to look at Ava as a threat to take this district. They’ll have no problem with Buffalo. District 4 - CLICK HERE FOR THE BRACKET East Newton at Reeds Spring Jordan’s Pick: Reeds Spring – One of the worst offenses in Class 3 against one of the best defenses. The loss to Bolivar is the worst thing that could have happened for East Newton. Joboo’s Pick: Reeds Spring – The Patriots are just the medicine the Wolves need to recover from their disappointing loss to Bolivar. Cassville at Mount Vernon Jordan’s Pick: Mount Vernon – I can’t go against the ‘Neers. Cassville has played great the last few weeks and River Phelps has 10 touchdowns in his last two games. But, I like Mount Vernon’s weapons on the turf. Joboo's Pick: See toughest call. Hollister at Aurora Jordan’s Pick: Aurora – Aurora wants a shot at a district championship and another crack at Monett. Both happen with a win here. Joboo’s Pick: Aurora – With their defense and QB Payton Evans, Aurora is a real contender to take this district. They would love a rematch with Monett. Seneca at Monett Jordan’s Pick: Monett – These Cubs know how to win in October, unlike the Chicago version. Too soon? Joboo’s Pick: Monett – Should be no problem for the Cubs. Look for Michael Branch to play the bulldozer in this one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:44:38.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
