You get an understanding of why a team works and why it doesn't. \n\"It was something a bit different but not without a purpose, it wasn't just a jolly - there was some thought process behind it. \n\"It was a nice way to start the week and also with a new group, to get them together in a different environment, get them talking and it was helpful in terms of the training as well. \n\"I was wringing wet, like everyone else, by the end of it.\" \nSheffield Wednesday keeper Joe Wildsmith has replaced the injured Angus Gunn but all of the squad trained at St George's Park on Monday. \nEngland won their opening Group Nine game 1-0 in Norway last month and play their third match at the Ricoh Arena having beaten Germany 1-0 in 2006 and Macedonia 6-3 in 2009. \nBut Southgate insisted Tuesday's qualifier is unlikely to be another goal feast. \nHe added: \"I would be delighted but very surprised. They are very well organised with the threat on the counter attack. The name isn't synonymous with high-level international football but their performances are improving.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:59:08.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
