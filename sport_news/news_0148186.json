Former Kaiserslautern defender Wolf spent nearly five years as boss of Wolfsburg - nicknamed The Wolves - prior to his sacking in March 2003. \nARSENE WENGER (Arsenal) \nAnother boss whose name was a perfect fit when he joined in September 1996. Part of the club's fabric now, although little was known about him when he arrived from Japan's Nagoya Grampus Eight. \nPETER HARTLEY AND JAMES POOLE (Hartlepool) \nThe pair were on target in February 2013, to help Hartlepool end a 12-match home winless run with a 2-1 win over Notts County in League One. \nTONY DINGWALL AND STEVEN ROSS (Ross County) \nDingwall-based Ross County had these two on their books last season, Dingwall remains, although fellow forward Ross has since moved to Division One Dumbarton. \nFERNANDO DE NAPOLI (Napoli) \nMidfielder De Napoli played more than 170 games for Napoli between 1986 and 1992, helping them to two Serie A titles and a UEFA Cup. Born around 40 miles from the city, one of his 54 appearances for Italy was the 1990 World Cup semi-final against Argentina - at Napoli's Stadio San Paolo. \nPETR CECH (Czech Republic) \nArsenal's former Chelsea goalkeeper has played more than 100 games for the Czech Republic since making his debut in 2002. Prior to that, he represented his country at Under-15, Under-16, Under-17, Under-18, Under-20 and Under-21 level. \nMAURO MILANESE (Inter Milan) \nIn 1998, Parma defender Milanese played 16 league games on loan for Inter Milan. He would later go on to play for QPR from 2005 until 2007 and also manage Leyton Orient, where he lasted just six weeks in 2014. \nGARY HOOPER (Celtic) \nHooper did well for The Hoops, with 82 goals in 138 games prior to a move to Premier League side Norwich in 2013. Although the fee Celtic received was undisclosed, it is believed to be comfortably in excess of the Â£2.4million they paid Scunthorpe for the striker in 2010. \nand... \nGARRY HOCKING (Geelong) \nHocking showed commitment to Geelong in 1999, changing his name by deed poll to Whiskas after the cat food manufacturer agreed to pay the cash-strapped club and player. However, the Australian Football League refused to allow the name in its records, listing him as number 32 against Richmond - even though he appeared as Whiskas on the team-sheet. He changed his name back after a week. Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:53:07.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
