As for making the quick transition from starting, \"I've always been able to get ready real quick. I don't feel like it'd be an issue.\"\nHELD BACK: Infielder Stephen Drew has been diagnosed with a vestibular concussion and is doubtful to return.\nManager Joe Girardi said that Drew remained in New York over the weekend. Drew hasn't played in any of the Yankees' past nine games because of dizziness and trouble focusing.\n\"For right now it's doubtful because still hasn't been playing,\" Girardi said of the chances of Drew playing anytime soon.\nWhile awaiting test results, Drew accurately surmised that he was dealing with concussion symptoms related to an inner-ear imbalance.\nDrew believes it's tied to a cocktail of circumstances; a 2013 concussion that impacted his vestibular system, nasal congestion and a grounder that deflected off his face in a recent game.\nGAME ON: Lefty reliever Chasen Shreve's confidence might be shaken after an awful September, but \"we're going to use him the next couple of days to try to get him back on track,\" Girardi said.\n\"Is it possible I could use him [today] and Sunday and see if we could get [his] mojo back? Absolutely.\"\nOver his past eight games (4 2/3 innings), Shreve has yielded seven runs on 13 hits – four of them homers – with five walks.\nEmail: caldera@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:41:29.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
