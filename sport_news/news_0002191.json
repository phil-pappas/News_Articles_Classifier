Because what seems factual to me – what might seem hyperbolic to you – is that this game on Sunday is the most important of the Colts’ season. \nAnd not because it’s the next game of the season, as Chuck Pagano and Andrew Luck and everyone at the Colts complex on 56th Street were saying this week. That’s what they say every week: The upcoming game is the most important game of the season. And they’re right, of course. \nBut this one, this one’s different. This isn’t merely one-sixteenth of the season. This is the season. \nThe Colts’ season, you see, sits on a fulcrum. It could go either way, and not just because the Colts are 3-3 and literally will be a winning team – or a losing one – by late Sunday afternoon. \nThe Colts’ season sits on a fulcrum because they have not decided who they are. They can decide – they will decide – on Sunday. Insider: What the Colts can learn from Bob Knight \nThis isn’t about the Saints, who are much like the Colts: baffling, disappointing, dangerous. The Saints are merely the fodder, the canvas upon which the Colts will start to paint whatever art they can yet muster – or the canvas upon which the Colts will cough up some more bile and start a death march toward what would be the franchise’s most shocking offseason since Peyton Manning was asked to leave. \nWho would be asked to leave after this season, coach Chuck Pagano or General Manager Ryan Grigson or both? We’ll see, if the Colts lose to the Saints. Because it says here – it seems to me, anyway – that if the Colts can’t beat the 2-4 Saints at home, they surely can’t be expected to win at undefeated Carolina next week, or against (Peyton and) undefeated Denver the following week. Could they win at 4-2 Pittsburgh or even 2-3 Miami? \nWho can the Colts beat, if they can’t beat the Saints at Lucas Oil Stadium? \nThey can beat the rest of the AFC South. So don’t accuse me of saying something I’m not. What I am saying: The Colts are a playoff team because they will win their division. But that was never the bar this season, hasn’t been the bar since 2013, and in 2013 and again last season the Colts surpassed that low bar. They won the division both years, then won games in the playoffs – one in 2013, two last season. \nThe bar is higher this year than a fourth consecutive postseason appearance, though the future doesn’t seem nearly as much fun as it did in August. Back then Las Vegas had the Colts as Super Bowl favorites, and few people around these parts were disagreeing. I wasn’t disagreeing, either . The offseason looked good enough to separate the Colts from the Patriots, given the Colts’ offseason additions and the Patriots’ loss of Tom Brady for the season’s first four games . \nSo anyway … \nLots of those ships have sailed, and most of them sunk Sunday night off the coast of Lucas Oil Stadium. But on Sunday against the Saints, the Colts face a game in which they must answer – not to my satisfaction or yours, but to their own satisfaction – what kind of team they want to be. \nDo something for me: Ask yourself that very question some time, like the next time you’re faced with a difficult choice. Who do I want to be? Do I want to be someone who goes to the gym, attends my kid’s parent-teacher conference, volunteers at the Julian Center? Or do I want to be someone who sits on the couch and watches TV? Because I sure am tired and the beer in my fridge sure is cold. \nWho do the Colts want to be? It’s not just a matter of passing vs. rushing, though that is another question to answer. Do the Colts want to be a team that has Frank Gore average 6 yards per rush for 13 carries – as he was doing against the Patriots – before dropping back to throw 26 times in a row? \nMore to the point, more basic than that: Do the Colts want to be a team that fights back — or do the Colts want to be who they were a year ago, when they consistently decided the best way to defend themselves was to lie in a corner and wait for the beating to stop? Doyel: Pagano, Colts seek to move on from 'That Play' \nIt’s fighting time. The country is still giggling at the Colts for the way they gave away any shot of beating the Patriots on Sunday . The fan base is still wondering if this team can beat anyone outside the AFC South. \nThe general manager has to be wondering what happened to offseason acquisitions like Andre Johnson and Trent Cole and Todd Herremans, and even first-round pick Phillip Dorsett. \nThe coach has to be wondering when Robert Mathis will make an impact. \nThe owner has to be wondering whom to fire, if this season goes south. \nIt can start to go south on Sunday against the Saints. Will it? Another question only the Colts can answer, as this season sits on the fulcrum and starts to tilt to the … \nFind Star columnist Gregg Doyel on Twitter at @GreggDoyelStar or at www.facebook.com/gregg.doyel 6 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://indy.st/1RZ23ya TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:20:39.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
