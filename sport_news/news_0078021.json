But the Eagles left having fallen one play short in a 28-22 loss to Worthington Kilbourne. \n\nThe Eagles nearly had their win. They got a Victor White 4-yard touchdown and a Brandon DeHass two-point conversion run to tie the score at 22, and when they fell behind by a touchdown with just over six minutes to go, they nearly drove the length of the field to tie it again. \n\nBut their playoff hopes were dashed by Josh Stoner, who helped guide Worthington Kilbourne (8-1) to what’s likely a guaranteed spot in the playoffs. \n\nThe senior running back caught two touchdown passes from quarterback Michael Bell-Wheelwright, scored late in the second quarter on a 55-yard punt return for a touchdown and added a 32-yard field goal in the third quarter to give the Wolves a 22-14 lead. \n\n“Josh, he’s really hard on himself, and he wasn’t really happy with his performances the last two weeks,” Worthington Kilbourne coach Vince Trombetti said. “I think he personally took it upon himself to leave it all out on the field at whatever cost.”\n\nStoner broke loose on a 66-yard run to set up the final score of the game, a 9-yard touchdown pass from Bell-Wheelwright to Stoner with 6:21 remaining. \n\n“I just tried to get upfield and make the first person miss, and then someone came up with a key block,” Stoner said of the big run. “Everyone did their part, and we came out with the win.”\n\nNew Albany (5-4, 4-2 Ohio Capital Conference Capital Division) pounded Worthington Kilbourne’s run defense. Early, the Wolves got a heavy dose of the 6-foot-1, 200-pound DeHass and White, who combined for 122 of New Albany’s 202 first-half rushing yards. \n\nThe Wolves (8-1, 5-1) responded to New Albany’s first-half scores with big plays, however. Bell-Wheelwright faked a handoff and then dashed up the right sideline 70 yards for a touchdown to tie the score at 7-7 in the first quarter.\n\nAn 11-play, 84-yard drive gave the Eagles a 14-7 lead, but two late first-half scores by Stoner gave the Wolves a 19-14 lead at the break. \n\nA tough running game, a stout offensive line and senior quarterback Casey Horch kept the Eagles alive late. In the final minutes, they drove inside Kilbourne’s 20-yard line, but the Wolves’ defense held. Horch’s fourth-down pass over the middle fell incomplete, and Bell-Wheelwright took a knee to secure his team’s win. \n\nNew Albany coach Pat Samanich said his team had been doing the little things right the past few weeks. His seniors were stepping up, and his run game was starting to fire on all cylinders. On Friday, the Eagles were just a play away from staying in the playoff hunt. \n\n“I’m going to be up all night thinking about that play call to try to put the guys in the right spot,” Samanich said. “(Horch) stood in there, and the offensive line stood in there. We just came up short. It hurts.”\n\nKilbourne wraps up its season at home against Olentangy Orange on Friday. New Albany travels to Mount Vernon. \n\n“That’s what happens when life hits us in the mouth,” Samanich said. “We’re going to come out on fire next week.”\naerickson@dispatch.com \n@AndrewRErickson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:27:01.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
