Those over 68 years old would see a $5 increase in fishing or combined fishing-hunting license, plus agent, habitat and transaction fees, under the proposal that must get final approval from state lawmakers. Over-68 muzzleloader and archery permits would be $2. Over-68 clam and oyster permits would be free, with no additional fees. Most increases would take effect Jan. 1. Residents who reach their 68th birthday before Jan. 1 would continue to be eligible for a free permanent license. The increases are meant to fill a $1.2 million hole in the Fish and Game department's proposed budget for the current biennium. \"The Legislature is counting on this new revenue to keep the Department going,\" Fish and Game Executive Director Glenn Normandeau said in a statement. Under the approved proposal, regular hunting and fishing license fees would increase by $10. The basic price (not including habitat, agent or transaction fees) for resident freshwater fishing licenses would go from $33 to $43; hunting licenses from $21 to $31; and combination hunting/fishing from $44 to $54. Annual hunting and fishing permit fees for non-residents, who already pay more, would also increase by $10. One-, three- and seven-day fishing permit fees would not change. Various miscellaneous permits would also increase, from special permits for taking additional deer to recreational lobster permits.

The labor coalition opposes the decision to privatize Nashua school custodians, which would result in 100 employees being losing their jobs, she said. \"Because of the Board of Education's plans to privatize the school custodians' jobs, the NLC opposes the incumbents' re-election,\" Howes added. The Nashua Labor Coalition said it previously endorsed Donchess for mayor because he \"has always been a strong advocate for working families.\" Aldermen candidates who won the coalition's endorsement include: n Alderman-at-Large - Brian S. McCarthy, Michael O'Brien and Lori Wilshire. n Ward 1 Janice Schmidt; Ward 2 Richard A. Dowd; Ward 3 Kimberly Kleiner; Ward 4 Thomas Lopez; Ward 6 Benjamin Clemons; Ward 7 June M. Caron and Ward 8 Mary Ann Melizzi-Golja. The coalition did not endorse candidates in the Wards 5 and 8 aldermen's races, both of which are uncontested. - KATHRYN MARCHOCKI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:30:28.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
