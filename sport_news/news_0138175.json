Getting in the World Golf Championships, the majors, that's where I want to be,\" he added after a two-under 69 left him at the top of the early second-round leaderboard alongside Dane Soren Kjeldsen.\nJustin Rose was 21 years and 307 days old when he won the British Masters in 2002.\nFitzpatrick will be 262 days younger if he triumphs on Sunday but the world number 111 seems more concentrated on booking his ticket for the 2016 U.S. Masters in the state of Georgia.\n\"If I don't win between now and Augusta but get in at Augusta through the rankings, I'll be a happy man,\" he said.\n\"I was lucky enough to play there as an amateur. I don't think there is anywhere like that place, it's so special.\"\nFitzpatrick has finished in the top three in three of his last seven outings. He has accumulated 681,000 euros ($774,297) in prize money this season but he had his leg pulled by fellow Englishman Chris Wood this week for the car he drives.\n\"I'm still getting abuse for having a Ford Mondeo,\" said the youngster. \"It's four or five years old.\n\"I started having my good results this season after the good deals had finished. I'll have to wait until next year now.\n\"I can't complain because the guy that gave it to me, he's a member of my golf club and it's on his company. I only pay for petrol so it's a great deal and it is great in terms of miles per gallon.\"\nFitzpatrick was asked if he could ever see himself emulating British Masters host Ian Poulter by owning six Ferraris.\n\"Not really, no,\" he replied. \"It's not something I would be desperate to fulfill.\"\n($1 = 0.8795 euros)\n(Editing by Pritha Sarkar )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:18:33.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
