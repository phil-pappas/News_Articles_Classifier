Tech quarterback Brenden Motley was sacked seven times. \nWith Pittsburgh leading 17-13 midway in the fourth quarter, both teams missed opportunities to grab more momentum. \nAfter forcing Pittsburgh to punt after a 10-play, 39-yard drive, Tech took over at its own 20-yard line with 7:02 left. Motley was pressured on first down and was intercepted by free safety Terrish Webb on an underthrown pass at Tech's 25. \nPittsburgh only advanced a yard on its next drive before Chris Blewitt set up for a 42-yard field goal. Deon Clarke blocked the field goal attempt, giving Tech the ball at its own 25 with 5:49 left. \nTech (2-3) did nothing with the next drive, losing nine yards on three plays. Motley was sacked by defensive end Ejuan Price for a 10-yard loss on third-and-9 from Tech's 26. \nAfter forcing another Pittsburgh punt, Tech had one last chance to pull it out starting at its own 38 with 3:25 remaining, but Motley was sacked twice on the possession. Tech lost 15 yards in three plays before punting it away. Tech never got the ball back. \nTech's Joey Slye cut Pittsburgh's lead to 17-13 with 13:20 left on a 48-yard field goal that was aided by an illegal substitution penalty on Pittsburgh. Slye was lining up for a 53-yard attempt before the penalty. \n\nPittsburgh running back Qadree Ollison broke loose on the first two plays of the third quarter for runs totalling 68 yards, including a 25-yard touchdown run that helped the Panthers build a 17-10 lead against Virginia Tech going into the fourth quarter. \nAfter falling behind 10-0, Virginia Tech tightened up on defense and went to halftime trailing 10-7. Motley completed an 11-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Cam Phillips with 11:38 left in the second quarter to cut Pittsburgh's lead to 10-7. \nMotley completed 6 of 10 passes for 56 yards, a touchdown and an interception in the first half. He was sacked twice on Tech's lone touchdown possession through the first three quarters, but he helped keep the drive alive by completing a 28-yard pass to tight end Bucky Hodges on third-and-17 from Pittsburgh's 40-yard line. \nDefense ruled the opening half. Pittsburgh finished the half with a 102-73 advantage in yards. Both teams had three sacks in the first 30 minutes. \nPittsburgh quarterbacks Chad Voytik and Nate Peterman combined to have 54 yards rushing in the first quarter, leading Pittsburgh to a 10-0 lead. Tech adjusted in the second quarter, sacking Peterman three times. \nVoytik, who had 118 yards rushing last season in Pittsburgh's 21-16 win against Tech, had 36 yards rushing at halftime. \nIn the first quarter, with Pittsburgh already up 3-0, Peterman found tight end J.P. Holtz wide open behind freshman strong safety Adonis Alexander on a 23-yard touchdown pass with 3:15 left, extending the Panthers' edge to 10-0. \nPeterman was 4 of 7 passing for 49 yards and a touchdown in the first half. Pittsburgh wide receiver Tyler Boyd was held to two catches for 21 yards. He entered the game averaging 10 1/2 catches per game in his first two contests this season. \nWood can be reached by phone at 757-247-4642", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T23:55:15.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
