Visiting Waitsburg started its Southeast 2B match spirited and scrappy, but by the third and final set, the undefeated Knights had hushed most of that pep with their business-like fashion in a 25-14, 25-9, 25-10 sweep of the Cardinals. “(The Knights) tend to be quiet, and I try to get them to talk more, but I always want them to talk about what it is they need to be doing as opposed to just laugh and giggle,” WWVA coach Scott Schafer said. “They have a lot of talent. I just try to keep them focused on what they need to do and doing it right. That’s been the goal all year.” The Knights (13-0 overall, 7-0 in the league) were coming off a busy weekend at home, where they bested their own three-day Fall Classic. It began with pool play, in which WWVA won a series of two-set matches and advanced to the brackets as the top seed. Two more wins the following day set them up against Portland Adventist Academy for the championship Saturday, and the Knights won the title 25-16, 24-26, 25-20 and 25-17. Senior setter Krista Schafer was selected the tournament’s Most Valuable Player, having totaled 188 assists and 29 digs. She almost cleared 95 percent of her serves, scoring 17 aces. Krista Schafer followed with 29 assists Tuesday against Waitsburg. “It was a good match for us,” coach Schafer said. “The girls played well. They had just come off a big tournament this weekend, so I wanted to make sure there wasn’t a let down because they won the tournament and things were going really great. “Waitsburg’s a young team, so we talked about making sure we did the little things right.” The Knights took advantage of their height and athleticism near the net, as 6-foot junior Alissa Hendrickson tallied nine kills, and 5-foot-11 freshman Gabrielle Browning made four blocks. WWVA’s Titi Graham sparked several scoring runs with strong serves, good on all 17 of her attempts, including four aces. Nalina McShane chipped in six digs. Meanwhile, Waitsburg’s Devon Harshman scored four kills, while Caitlyn Jones made eight digs and served five aces, and Bailey Adams added five digs “WWVA’s a good team, so I’m happy with how we played,” coach Angie Potts said. “I thought there were times when we competed really well. We were just obviously outmatched.” Both Waitsburg and WWVA return to action today. The Cardinals will host Asotin, while the Knights play in Pasco at Tri-Cities Prep.
