IC (5-1 overall, 2-0 Metro Suburban West) immediately turned the ball over, but Sutton got the ball back with another interception on the next play from scrimmage. \nThe sequence of turnovers came after RB gained 21 yards on a fourth-and-7 play to keep the drive alive. \nSutton also had an impact on the other side of the ball as he caught two passes, including a touchdown. \nIC running back Jordan Rowell was mostly held in check on the ground, gaining 79 yards on 21 carries, but he made his presence felt in the passing game as he hauled in four passes for 81 yards and a touchdown. \nLuke Ricobene passed for 181 yards and two touchdowns, and also rushed for 14 yards. \nDefensively, Jim Kenneally tallied 12 tackles, including one for loss, while Anthony Silva and Kemon Reese each had 10 tackles. Kenneally had two sacks and Robert Vitek had one. Jose Rodriguez had an interception. \n– \nWho: IC at Wheaton Academy \nWhen: 7:15 p.m. Oct. 9 \nWhere: 900 Prince Crossing Road, West Chicago \nRecords: IC 5-1 (2-0 MSW), WA 4-2 (0-2) \nOutlook: A win in this Metro Suburban West game would seal a playoff berth for the Knights, so they will have all the motivation they need. The Warriors have lost two straight and are seemingly vulnerable against the run as they yielded 321 rushing yards and seven touchdowns to Glenbard South running back Sean Cooke in a 55-14 loss on Oct. 3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:27:33.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
