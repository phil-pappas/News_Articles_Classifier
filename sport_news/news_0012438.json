The 6ft 10ins American did not face a single break point despite the Belgian forcing a tie-break in the second set. \nSixth seed Kei Nishikori came back from a set down to beat Australian Nick Kyrgios 1-6 6-4 6-4 in their second round clash. \nNishikori, who entered the contest after a first round bye, looked rusty in the early proceedings as he was broken in his very first service game. \nKyrgios ruthlessly capitalised, racing to a 5-0 lead before serving out for the first set. But the Japanese 25-year-old grew in confidence and took advantage of Kyrgios' heated exchange with the umpire after a line call at the end of the second set. The final set went with serve until Nishikori broke in the 10th game and he went on to clinch a spot in the last 16. \nAustralian world number 20 Bernard Tomic capitalised on a lacklustre performance from seventh seed David Ferrer to earn a 6-4 6-2 win. Tomic raced into a 5-0 lead in the first set before Ferrer broke back in the seventh and ninth games. But Tomic managed to serve out the set and go on to progress into the last 16. \nElsewhere US Open quarter-finalist Kevin Anderson booked his place in the third round with 6-3 7-6 (7/1) victory over Italy's Fabio Fognini.
