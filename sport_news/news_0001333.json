David Bowen got to meet the quarterback at Gillette Stadium Wednesday, the Boston Herald reported. \nBowen told the paper he has had season tickets since 1985. After he was presented with the ball, a ball boy asked if he'd be willing to switch it for another game ball, the Herald reported. \n\"I said, 'Sure, no problem,' and they just gave me another one,\" Bowen told the paper. \nBrady's \"400 ball\" is on display in The Hall at Patriot Place, the Herald said. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
