State's Maverick Rowan, Shaun Kirk and Caleb Martin at the team's basketball media day at Dail Basketball Center in Raleigh, N.C., on Thursday, Oct. 1, 2015. (Ethan Hyman/Raleigh News & Observer/TNS) Posted: Thursday, October 1, 2015 7:50 pm | Updated: 8:28 pm, Thu Oct 1, 2015. \nRALEIGH - N.C. State coach Mark Gottfried and his players met with the media Wednesday in preparation for Sunday's first practice. Observer sports reporter Stephen Schramm was on hand as the Wolfpack discussed the 2015-16 season. \nBig picture \nN.C. State coach Mark Gottfried knows this season's team will face its share of doubters. \nThree of last season's top four scorers are gone, among them are veteran leaders Trevor Lacey and Ralston Turner. \nCat Barber was last season's breakout star, but he's now the Wolfpack's only proven option at point guard. And with a collection of untested wings and big men who have experience but little in the way of offensive punch, he's not exactly surrounded by weapons. \n\"We've got a lot of holes to fill, we've got young guys that have to step forward in a major way and hopefully we can put it all together,\" Gottfried said. \"At the beginning of the year, if I was predicting our league out, I could see where we could be picked ninth or 10th or 11th in the league with what we've lost. But for us, it's not about how we start, it's about how we finish.\" \nWhile there are questions, historically, Gottfried's teams have answered them. During his time in Raleigh, he's taken the team to four-straight NCAA tournaments and two Sweet 16s. The majority of those runs came with teams that started the season facing similar questions. \n\"Do the last four years give us confidence? Sure it does,\" Gottfried said. \"It doesn't guarantee you anything for this year's team. We could still be very average at the end. We hope we're not. We hope we can figure how to be good.\" \nBiggest surprise \nWolfpack center BeeJay Anya wasn't surprised that he was asked about his weight. The only real shock may have been how much of a non-story it ended up being. \n\"I'm pretty sure it's a question I'm going to be asked forever,\" Anya said. \nSaying he was in the \"best shape of his life,\" the 6-foot-9 junior now weighs 281 pounds. He'd like to get it down to 275 before the season starts. \n\"When I look at myself, I don't feel like I look any different because I see myself every day,\" Anya said. \"But when I look at pictures from my freshman year, I'm like 'Wow, I was big. I was really big.'\" \nAnya came to N.C. State clocking in at roughly 350 pounds. He labored through his freshman season carrying the extra weight but got himself down to 290 prior to last season. \nIn the offseason, Gottfried expressed frustration that Anya hadn't kept up the progress. But on Wednesday, he offered praise for Anya's work. \n\"We're not where we need to be, period, but he needs to get a lot of credit right now for taking some good steps, he's done a good job,\" Gottfried said. \"I'm a strong believer that he's a completely different player when he's not lugging around a nine-year old on his back, which he's done for two years.\" \nBiggest question \nThe most glaring area of weakness this season's Wolfpack team will have to correct involves its need for reliable long-range shooting. \nLast season, Lacey and Turner were potent weapons from beyond the arc, accounting for 172 of the team's 236 3-pointers. Finding players to fill the void they left will be a challenge. \n\"I think that we have good shooters, they just haven't done it yet,\" Gottfried said. \"We'll find out.\" \nBarber became a threat late in the season and Caleb Martin showed flashes of being able to score from the outside. West Virginia transfer Terry Henderson and freshman win Maverick Rowan also represent potential solutions. \n\"It's a little bit different than doing it in here,\" Gottfried said while standing in the Wolfpack's practice gym. \"It's a little bit different to do it when the popcorn's popping and the people are in the gym. We're going to have to figure that one out.\" \nQuotable \n\"He's mad because they're saying 'Lennard got Richard Howell's number.' They're not saying 'he got Trevor's number.'\" \n- Lennard Freeman on the reaction of former teammate Trevor Lacey to his decision to switch to Lacey's old jersey number. \nStaff writer Stephen Schramm can be reached at schramms@fayobserver.com or at 486-3536.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:55:29.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
