(For OzarksSportsZone.com) -- The Clever Lady Jays defeated the Billings Lady Wildcats 2-0 (25-19, 25-20) on Tuesday night. It was Senior Night at Clever and senior Lacey Menzie led the Lady Jays with 11 assists.“It feels really good to win on Senior Night,” said Menzie, “like going out with a bang. It would have been bad to lose. Sometimes at home we get too much into the crowd, too comfortable on our home turf. Being a senior, it feels good to help my younger teammates and help bring them up when they get down.” CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS Clever has had problems winning the second sets on their own floor this season. In the second set, after winning the first set 25-19, they trailed early against the Lady Wildcats, causing coach Angie Wise to call a timeout. During the timeout, Wise didn’t talk strategy but rather motivation.“This is what I told them,” said Wise. “Girls, we are not playing well right now, we are getting sloppy. We haven’t won a second set on this floor in I don’t know how long. Just go out tonight and win a second set for once. Then all of a sudden, bam, they said let’s do that, and they did.” After the timeout, Clever got out to a 20-12 lead but the Wildcats still had fight left as they scored five of the next seven points. Down 22-17, Billings missed some serves and Clever had some big hits, thus ending the Wildcats’ night, 25-20. Billings, even after dropping both sets, felt like they played up to par with Clever.“We’ve been focusing on serves the last couple of games and tonight they let us down a little bit,” said Billings coach Brittany Cheek. “Overall, I think we had a good serving game, we just missed a couple of serves at inopportune times. We need to focus on our defense because our opponents in districts have good outside hitters. We are going to have to shift our defense and get our blockers there. We’d rather see a team like Clever at the end of the season. That way, we know what we need to work on more and focus on when we get into districts. We can be a pretty scrappy team.” Clever, who has played most of the season without outside hitter junior Emily Mendenhall, saw one of her better games tonight as she totaled five kills.“I feel like I’m getting a lot better; maybe not 100%, but pretty close,” said Mendenhall. “It was terrible watching my team play without me. When we got behind in the second set, we all told each other “hey, pick our heads up, here we go, we’re going to clean it up and play like we know we can.” We just get way too into the crowd and the cheers instead of focusing on finishing the game. I’m feeling really confident with our team. We need to keep our heads up and play the game that we know we can play and we should be fine.”“We played well tonight,” said Wise. “We struggle on our home court; we finally played a full two sets on our court, pretty accurate most of the time. There were just a couple instances where we struggled. Harper Little and Lacey Menzie made some great defensive plays. Our passing came together.”“We are where we need to be,” said Wise, “exactly where we deserve to be. We are trying to play our best game of the year right now. I like our chances.” Clever will face Crane on Thursday night in a winner-take-all matchup for the SWCL championship. District play begins next week for both teams.
