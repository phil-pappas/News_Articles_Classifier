What that means for Cutler’s potential to start Sunday against the Oakland Raiders, however, remains fuzzy.\nBears coach John Fox said he felt encouraged by Cutler's work Wednesday.\n“I thought he had a good practice,\" Fox said. \"He was limited. Obviously we’re trying to treat him and get him better as we move forward. But I thought we had a good day today.”\nCutler still seems like a bit of a long shot to return to his starting role this week. If he is unable to go, Jimmy Clausen would likely get his second consecutive start.\nCutler suffered his injury attempting to tackle Cardinals safety Tony Jefferson during a 26-yard interception return for a touchdown. He did not practice at all last week and watched Sunday as Clausen completed nine of his 17 pass attempts for 63 yards in a 26-0 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. That marked the first time in nearly 13 years that the Bears had been shut out.\nDuring his seven seasons in Chicago, Cutler has missed 14 games due to injury and another after being benched. The Bears are 5-10 in those games.\nThe Bears haven’t experienced an 0-3 start or a winless September since 2003.\nWide receiver Alshon Jeffery also was limited in practice Wednesday.\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Bears Jay Cutler Jimmy Clausen Arizona Cardinals John Fox Seattle Seahawks Oakland Raiders", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560c0cb8/turbine/ct-jay-cutler-practice-20150930"], "published": "2015-09-30T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:06:40.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
