After a tougher start to the season than many predicted, the Terps are mustering everything they've got to take on the top-ranked team in the nation in the Buckeyes. \nMeanwhile, their next 'big thing' at the Bullis School nearby has been practicing to take on Riverdale High this Friday. Today, the highest-ranked quarterback Maryland has successfully recruited, Bullis senior Dwayne Haskins, has also been forced to answer questions on social media outlets regarding his commitment status to the program... \nAs rumors began swirling regarding the status of the Terrapin coaching staff as the team enters Week 6 at only 2-3 on the season, those in the college football circles began questioning whether or not the 4-star quarterback recruit still wants to head to the College Park campus next year. But Haskins, who's said he's been 110% committed since he made his final decision, still says with complete confidence that he's a Terp. His focus right now? Staying plugged in at school and staying an active and engaged teammate at practice. Haskins reaffirmed his loyalty to the Terrapins today on Twitter. Blessed to have this opportunity.
