Its always been ironic that they call UK & Cal ‚Äúsleazy‚Äù when they employ, or have employed Pitino, Petrino, Hurt, etc. Just typing those names make me cringe, yet their fans act like none of that matters.

It doesnt really make sense to have a UK fan discussing UofL. I think it would be smarter to have a UL fan on to say what they think about the scandal and how it should be handled. But with that being said, good luck Matt.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:35:00.668+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
