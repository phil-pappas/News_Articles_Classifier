Tomlin said he will go on the assumption that Landry Jones will be the starting quarterback because “he is the one who is healthy.”\nAdChoices Tomlin said he will monitor the status of Roethlisberger and backup Mike Vick (hamstring) on a day-to-day basis, but lean on the team’s medical staff before he decides how to proceed.\n“We’ll watch their ability to protect themselves and their ability to perform,” Tomlin said.\nTomlin even said he’s not sure if either Roethlisberger or Vick would be available to be the backup quarterback against the Chiefs.\n“Maybe it’s not either,” Tomlin said. “I’m less concerned who the backup will be as I am getting (Jones) ready.”\nHe added, “We’re going to focus on getting Landry ready. We can’t lose preparation time with speculation.”\nRoethlisberger has missed the past three games with a tear of the medial collateral ligament and a bruised tibia. He practiced lightly in 7-on-7 drills last week and said he plans to be a full participant in practice starting Wednesday.\nJones replaced an injured Vick in the third quarter Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals and led the Steelers to scores on four consecutive possessions. He threw two touchdowns in a 25-13 victory .\n“I appreciate the quality of his play,” Tomlin said.\nTomlin said linebackers Jarvis Jones (hip) and Ryan Shazier (shoulder) should be “well enough” to return and play against the Chiefs. He was less certain about safety Will Allen (ankle) and defensive end Stephon Tuitt (knee).\nMeantime, Tomlin said he did not like the Steelers’ inability to convert third downs against the Cardinals. They were 0 for 6 in the first half and 3 for 12 for the game. Many of those came on runs in short-yardage situations.\nThe Steelers had nine runs of zero or negative yards against the Cardinals.\n“I thought we had some very makeable third downs,” Tomlin said. “That hurt our efforts to score. We lost two third-and-1s and two third-and-3s, and that can’t be our personality.”\nThe Steelers gave up four passes of 32 yards or longer against the Cardinals, but Tomlin said his defensive backs were in position to make plays on several of them, including a 45-yarder on the first play of the game.\n“They had two or three balls that very easily could have been ours,” Tomlin said.\n2015-16 NFL season Go to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.post-gazette.com/", "http://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2015/10/18/Pittsburgh-Steelers-vs-Arizona-Cardinals-at-Heinz-Field-October-18-2015-NFL-football/stories/201510180230", "https://w.graphiq.com/w/k7bn0vxhZFr?data-mcuid=7d00c4a52b&data-mccampaign=6f6207e131", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:33:30.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
