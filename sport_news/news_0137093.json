But the Bucks aren’t getting caught up in thoughts of a turnaround winning season. The fact they are 0-2 in district play re-emphasizes a one-game-at-a-time approach entering Friday’s 7 p.m. kickoff in District 3-1A. “We feel like we’ve improved, and hopefully we’ve come to the point we can play with Freeport,” Bozeman coach Lyle Messer said. “But we know we have to play our best game to beat them.” Confidence for the Bucks was boosted, by of all things, a 55-21 loss at Blountstown three weeks ago. The Bucks were within one touchdown midway through the third quarter of that game before the No. 5 team in the state pulled away. When you fell victim to a running clock eight times one season ago, sometimes there are such things as moral victories, even in a 34-point defeat. “We probably caught (Blountstown) at a good time, but it was a little bit of a shot in the arm,” Messer said. “It’s a drastic difference from a year before. Sometimes the little positives can continue to add up. It’s more important for a program like us.” Bozeman following by defeating Franklin County 35-7, then was idle last week. Freeport, 4-3, 0-2, lost 42-0 to Blountstown last Friday. “We had a lot of injuries early on and everybody’s getting healthy again,” Messer said. “I think we’re better on the offensive line. We’ve had so many new additions that we are now where we should have been in August.” Bozeman finally got some resemblance of a running game against FranklinCounty. Julio Pineiro low leads the team with a still-modest 152 yards on 30 carries. The passing combination of Logan Foster to Zach Mclawhorn continues to define the squad. Foster had passed for 1,292 yards and 14 touchdowns, and Mclawhorn leads all area receivers with 37 catches for 851 yards (23.0 average) and 11 TDs. Page 2 of 2 - Messer believes that some opponents might have overlooked Bozeman’s ability to move the ball through the air, especially in defending Mclawhorn. And he feels the coaching staff has made needed adjustments to keep the tandem clicking. That in mind, Messer thinks the key to edging Freeport is Bozeman’s defense. “We’ve got to keep Freeport’s offense off the field,” Messer said. “We can’t let them hold it 12 of 13 plays at a time. If they keep the ball and limit our possessions it’s going to be hard for us to win. “The crucial thing is forcing three-and-outs and getting the ball back.” North Bay Haven 0-7, at South Walton 3-4 In all candor, North Bay Haven is trying to survive to Week 10 when the schedule becomes more forgiving. It’s doesn’t tonight against a South Walton team that has lost to four opponents who combined have lost four games this season. Neither will the Seahawks be overly hospitable considering they were eliminated from playoff contention last week. The Buccaneers started the season with mostly a junior varsity roster considering only four seniors suited up. They have been riddled by injuries since, and have to be looking forward to their final two games against R.F. Munroe and Bozeman.
