But within a day, hundreds of people got an up-close look at the former as Yellow Nose wandered along Northwest Leif Erickson Drive, a gated road that runs through the park.\nYellow Nose stopped for the night about a mile up Leif Erickson, just south of Northwest Germantown Road.\n\"He'd been running from people until he couldn't run anymore,\" Gleason said.\nThe exhausted animal lay beside heavily traveled Leif Erickson, about three miles from his home. Yellow Nose became an unexpected roadside attraction for a steady stream of hikers and bikers.\nDespite his long curving horns and hefty size, Yellow Nose posed no immediate danger to passersby if he isn't disturbed, Gleason said.\n\"(Oryx) are not tame, but they're not threatening,\" Gleason said Sunday after he and two veterinarians captured the beast about noon.\nGleason is known for his devotion to oryx. He has posted adorable videos to YouTube, including this one:\nOn Saturday, Gleason and Tony Adams, who helps care for the oryx herd, spent the night in the woods until 5 a.m. monitoring Yellow Nose's whereabouts. They parked a trailer on the road near the animal and tried to entice Yellow Nose inside with grain.\nYellow Nose wasn't buying.\nThe oryx moved around a little but didn't travel far, Gleason said. \"He'd go up the road a ways. Maybe he was trying to go home.\"\nPlan B called for drugging the animal. That required an expert.\n\"I didn't think we'd find anybody to come out on a Sunday,\" Gleason said.\nGleason contacted a veterinary clinic in Woodburn that once cared for the oryx. Blake Miller, who works at the clinic, and Brian Dietrich, who used to work there, responded.\nAs the veterinarians prepared the tranquilizer dose and readied the rifle, a runner stopped to ask what was happening.\n\"Road maintenance,\" deadpanned one of the vets to the disbelieving runner.\nDietrich, moving with a hunter's stealth, quietly stepped through the underbrush to get a clear shot. A full-grown oryx weights more than 300 pounds and provides an ample target.\nYellow Nose, hit twice, didn't go down.\nHe got up and walked about 150 yards up the road, the veterinarians close on his heels.\nDietrich reloaded. After waving off a couple of cyclists and a woman walking her dog, he fired one more dart. Yellow Nose again seemed unaffected and took a few steps off the road.\nThen he wobbled and fell. The vets secured the oryx and loaded Yellow Nose into a trailer for the short ride home.\nBack in Gleason's fenced pasture, the vets administered a drug to counteract the tranquilizer's narcotic effect. Yellow Nose remained woozy but slowly revived, mooing and chewing his cud.\nGleason, a semi-retired electrical engineer, was greatly relieved.\n\"That was a long night, man, I'm sure glad it's over,\" Gleason said as he walked in his front door. \"That was quite an adventure for me.\"\nAnd of course, this being Portland, naturally this happened:\n@PDXoryx Tweets about @pdxoryx\n-- Betsy Hammond and Elliot Njus of The Oregonian/OregonLive staff contributed to this report.\n-- Steve Mayes\nsmayes@oregonian.com\n503-294-5916; @ocmayes", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ocmayes", "https://twitter.com/search?q=%40pdxoryx", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ys9ZTdmM-2E"], "published": "2015-10-25T22:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:43:58.352+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
