No more than seven can get through championship Saturday that way. \nOf those 14 unbeatens, all but one is guaranteed to avoid playing another unbeaten team between now and the College Playoff Football selections on Dec. 6. \nThat would be No. 3 Utah, the last remaining unbeaten team in the Pac-12. Despite not having to face another team with a perfect record, the Utes road to an undefeated season and a spot in the playoff is anything but smooth. \nA major hurdle to clear comes Saturday when Utah goes to Southern California. The Trojans have lost three games and had their coach fired, but as they showed last week at Notre Dame there is no shortage of talent at USC. \nIn fact, odds-makers favor USC, so don’t call it an upset if the Utes fall to Troy. \nSpeaking of upsets, only one game matches ranked teams this weekend - No. 15 Texas A&M; at No. 24 Ole Miss. If the national title race gets a shake, it will be come from somewhere unexpected. \nThe picks: \nTHURSDAY NIGHT LIGHTS \nNo. 20 California (plus 3) at UCLA \nEven with two conference losses, Bruins can still hope for a Pac-12 title - but not with three … UCLA 35-28. \nNo. 22 Temple (plus 3) at East Carolina \nPirates aren’t getting much attention in the American, but they have close losses at Florida and BYU … EAST CAROLINA 27-20. \nFRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS \nNo. 18 Memphis (minus 10) at Tulsa \nPotential trap game for Tigers coming off huge win against Mississippi … MEMPHIS 45-38.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:52:20.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
