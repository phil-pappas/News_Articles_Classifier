Gibson, who did not start because of a strained left knee, limped around the bases as the Dodgers won one of the most dramatic games in series history. \n1997 — The Cleveland Indians survived another brilliant effort by Mike Mussina and claimed their second pennant in three years, defeating the Baltimore Orioles 1-0 on an 11th-inning homer by Tony Fernandez to win the AL championship series 4-2. \n2003 — The Florida Marlins took their third game in a row, winning the NLCS with a 9-6 victory over Chicago in Game 7. Florida became just the ninth team to overcome a 3-1 deficit in a best-of-seven series. \n2007 — With their 21st win in 22 games, the Colorado Rockies beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 6-4 to sweep the NL championship series and advance to the World Series for the first time in franchise history. The wild-card Rockies joined the 1976 Cincinnati Reds as the only teams to start a postseason with seven straight wins. Matt Holliday’s three-run homer highlighted a six-run fourth inning for Colorado. \n2008 — Jimmy Rollins homered in the first inning, Cole Hamels pitched his third gem of the playoffs and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the bumbling Los Angeles Dodgers 5-1 to win the NL championship series 4-1 for its first pennant since 1993. \n2011 — Nelson Cruz and the Texas Rangers finished off the Detroit Tigers to become the American League’s first repeat champion in a decade. Cruz set a postseason record with his sixth home run of the series, Michael Young hit a pair of two-run doubles in a nine-run third inning, and the Rangers romped to a 15-5 win in Game 6 of the ALCS. Cruz had 13 RBIs in the series, another postseason record, and was selected MVP. \n2013 — John Lackey edged Justin Verlander and Boston’s bullpen shut down Detroit’s big hitters with the game on the line to lift the Red Sox over the Tigers 1-0 for a 2-1 lead in the AL championship series. Mike Napoli homered in the seventh inning off Verlander, and Detroit’s attempt at a rally fell short in the eighth when Miguel Cabrera and Prince Fielder both struck out with runners at the corners. \n2014 — The Kansas City Royals advanced to their first World Series since 1985 after finishing a four-game sweep in the AL Championship Series with a 2-1 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. The Royals will carry an 11-game playoff win streak into the World Series, one shy of the major league record. That includes their first eight this season, something that had never been done in postseason history.
