The England forward played a ball back out to Ozil, who was waiting patiently on the penalty spot to dispatch a cool sidefoot finish into the bottom left corner. \nFollowing the electric start, the tempo of the match dropped, as United look to build a spell of possession. \nIt was, though, only a brief respite before Sanchez delivered a world-class finish to put Arsenal 3-0 ahead. \nAnother quick break found Walcott, who in turn fed the ball out to the left. \nSanchez brushed off the challenge of Matteo Darmian before sidestepping Chris Smalling and firing the ball into the top-right corner. \nIt was now a case of damage limitation for Louis van Gaal's men, who had come into the match on the back of three straight league wins. \nArsenal should have moved further ahead on 34 minutes when Sanchez chipped a ball over to Aaron Ramsey unmarked at the far post, but the Wales midfielder could only blast his shot high into the Clock End. \nAs half-time approached, Petr Cech produced a stunning block to deny Anthony Martial at point-blank range after the in-former French forward turned smartly in the penalty area. \nArsenal continued where they had left off at the start of the second half, with Ozil flashing a low drive just wide following a free-kick. \nAt the other end, Cech got down well to turn a low, curling shot from Wayne Rooney behind before then coming out to make a brave block at the feet of Bastian Schweinsteiger. \nDuring the closing stages, Sanchez was forced off with what looked like a groin problem. \nIn stoppage-time, Arsenal substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was unfortunate not to make it 4-0 when his angled chip floated over the keeper, but hit the crossbar. \nTWEET OF THE MATCH \nPiers Morgan @piersmorgan - 'Best first half I have ever watched as an Arsenal fan. Played United off the pitch & half way back down the M1.' \nhttps://twitter.com/piersmorgan/status/650700719989911552", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:50:06.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
