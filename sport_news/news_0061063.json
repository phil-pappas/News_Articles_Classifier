Andres Potts tallied the first goal for Prescott (10-2 record) at the 19th minute, converting a pass from Garcia. Garcia doubled the lead eight minutes later, with an assist from Caro, and increased it to 3-0 at the 30th minute with help from Jose Gonzalez. Garcia returned the favor five minutes later, this time Gonzalez finding the back of the net for 4-0 lead at halftime. Two duo connected again at the 58th minute to put the finishing touch on the Tigers’ win. Prescott next plays Wednesday at home against Dayton. The Tigers have four regular-season matches remaining before a seven-team sub-regional tournament the first week of November determines the two teams advancing to the state tournament.
