The Central Catholic coach watched a ceremony prior to last night’s nonleague game against No. 10 Everett honoring the life and career of former Crimson Tide, Northeastern and Cincinnati Bengals star Dan Ross.\nHe then watched his team continue what he hopes to be a tradition of victories at Everett Memorial Stadium.\nWide receiver Steven Jackson caught six passes for 91 yards, rushed for 54 more and scored two touchdowns to lead the No. 9 Raiders to a 24-0 homecoming shutout of Everett last night.\n“We embrace it,” Adamopoulos said of his team’s trips to Everett. “I’m a traditionalist. I enjoy coming here because they have tradition here. This is one of the few places in Massachusetts where they have the whole community get behind football. It’s a city that’s still proud of their team. I like coming here.”\nHe’ll like it even more if his team continues its two-game win streak on the Tide’s home turf. It started quickly for Central (3-1) — Dan Doherty recovered a fumble on the game’s opening kickoff, then Jackson caught a 14-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Brett Edwards.\nEdwards had a 2-yard TD run of his own in the second quarter, and Central added a pair of safeties when Everett (1-3) twice snapped the ball through the end zone while attempting to punt.\nAt the end of the half, Jackson produced another big play. Taking a reverse, he tucked the ball in and raced 43 yards for a score that capped the scoring.\n“It was actually an option reverse and I was supposed to pass the ball,” Jackson said. “(Intended receiver Omar Deschamps), I didn’t see him open at first, so I got to the line and took off running. He made a great block around the 20-25 yard line and I just took off.”\nDefensively, Central held Everett to just 101 total yards, 6 on the ground. The Raiders also recovered two fumbles, collected a pair of interceptions and recorded four sacks.\n“The defense came up big for us,” praised Adamopoulos. “We had great field position, we came up with turnovers when we needed them.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T11:12:32.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
