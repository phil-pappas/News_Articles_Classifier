Croatia finished second with five points, while Chile had four points. Nigeria and Croatia go through, automatically, to the Round of 16, while third placed USA will wait to see if they are eligible as one of the four best third finished teams. \nGroup A Final Table \nP W D L GF GA GD PTS Nigeria 3 2 – 1 8 3 +5 6 Croatia 3 1 2 – 5 4 +1 5 Chile 3 1 1 1 6 7 -1 4 USA 3 – 1 2 3 8 -5 1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:49:06.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
