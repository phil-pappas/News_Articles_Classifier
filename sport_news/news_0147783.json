McNALL gmcnall@fltimes.com Finger Lakes Times | 0 comments \nWhere did the Friday night lights go? \nOh sure, there are games on tonight’s slate, but the majority of this weekend’s action falls on Saturday, due to Homecoming festivities. \nThe most intriguing game of the weekend might be the one taking place near Keuka Lake tonight: \nTonight \nBatavia (4-0) at Penn Yan (4-0) \nThis might not be the only meeting of the year between these two Class B sectional title contenders. Batavia comes in ranked No. 10 in the latest New York State Sportswriters poll, while Penn Yan sits at No. 12. Batavia topped Penn Yan 35-12 in last year’s Class B semifinals on its way to a sectional title. \nBoth teams have given up about the same number of points (Penn Yan 64, Batavia 62). Penn Yan’s offense has scored an average of 43.5 points per game while the Blue Devils check in at 33.7. \nBatavia’s Ray Leach rushed for 149 yards last week. Quarterback Greg Mruczek completed 7 of 13 passes for 102 yards and three touchdowns. \nPenn Yan has a balanced offense of its own. Quarterback Tanner Irwin totaled 117 yards rushing and 135 passing in a win over Waterloo last weekend. Austin Fingar and Dylan Stape combined for 157 yards on the ground. \nWayne (0-4) at Newark (1-3, 0-3), 7:15 p.m. \nThere’s a lot at stake for these two Class B teams. The winner will keep its quest for a sectional bid alive. The Reds are coming off their first victory of the year, a 47-32 non-league win over Leadership. \nSaturday \nWaterloo (1-3, 1-2) at Geneva (3-1), 7 p.m . \nThis one features two breakaway threats at running back. Waterloo’s Jakuar Ali had 102 yards against Penn Yan. Geneva’s Mark Suchewski piled up 195 in a win over Pal-Mac.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:07:29.406+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
