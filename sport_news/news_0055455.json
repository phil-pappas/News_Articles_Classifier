He alluded to it eight times while talking to the media after the game. \n“I’ve got to play smarter,” he said quietly in an otherwise happy Colts locker room. \nGore was asked a dozen or so questions after the 16-13 victory over Jacksonville and more than half of them included an \"I've got to play smarter\" response. Most such utterances followed with the veteran running back shaking his head back and forth. \nGore had a similar miscue two weeks ago here against the New York Jets. Set to bounce into the end zone, Gore dropped the ball and Darrelle Revis recovered for a touchback. Sunday's fumble was more explainable – Josh Evans delivered a pop – but Gore couldn’t hang on again. Jacksonville’s Abry Jones recovered the ball in the end zone. Doyel: No style, no problem. Colts simply win \n“Going (in) to put points on the board on the goal line, I’ve got to put two hands on the ball and make better decisions,” Gore said. “I’ve got to stop pressing and play football and have fun.” \nGore then shook off a question about the long left-side run that set up Adam Vinatieri’s winning 27-yard field goal. \n“I feel like if I don’t put the ball on the ground we’re not in that situation,” he said. “Like I said, I’ve got to play smarter; I’ve got to play smarter. \n“(Even if) we get three points there we don’t have to go into overtime.” \nIn fairness, Gore acknowledged playing with a damaged left first finger. Initially injured in camp, he said he landed awkwardly on it during the first series of the Sept. 27 win at Tennessee. \n“I can’t really grip the ball with my left hand,” he said. Coach Chuck Pagano and quarterback Matt Hasselbeck discuss the Indianapolis Colts' 16-13 victory over Jacksonville. Matt Kryger / The Star Matt Kryger / The Star \nGore wasn’t the only Colts running back with slippery fingers. Backup Josh Robinson lost a fumble on a multisided hit in the second quarter. That turnover set up Jacksonville’s only touchdown. \n“It was just one of those plays where (linebacker Dan Skuta) got a good hit on the ball,” Robinson said. “Helmet was right on the ball. How’s a guy protect the ball? \n“It was a bang-bang play.” \nBut the rookie’s fumbles are getting to be a problem. The sixth-round pick out of Mississippi State had one in the third preseason game, then would have lost another against Buffalo in Week 1 had a penalty not negated the play. \n“I’ve got to get right, protect the ball, protect the quarterback,” Robinson said. The making of Frank Gore: 'I've been through so much' \nWhat happens Thursday in Houston will be interesting to watch. Robinson wasn’t given another chance to carry the ball Sunday after the fumble, finishing with three carries for only 2 yards. \nGore wasn’t much better until the 22-yard game-sealer: 16 carries for 31 yards. That struggle included nine first-half carries for 6 yards, and much of that came on a 5-yard run. \nGore and Robinson refused to say the Jaguars' defense focused on stopping the run and forcing backup quarterback Matt Hasselbeck to beat them, but that’s what happened. Colts receivers often found themselves singled-covered as Hasselbeck handed off to the running backs. \nThe result was the Colts’ lowest rushing output of the season (60 yards) and the group’s most inefficient outing (2.5 yards per carry). \nAnd that includes Gore’ 22-yarder. \n“We’ve got to get better,” said Gore, who blamed two dropped screen passes on the bum finger. “We’re hurting ourselves with turnovers. We’ve got to play better, smarter.” \n“I can’t be putting us in that situation.” \nFollow Curt Cavin on Facebook and Twitter: @curtcavin \nColts at Texans, 8:25 p.m. Thursday, CBS, NFL 1 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://indy.st/1LcBtQS TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:29:07.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
