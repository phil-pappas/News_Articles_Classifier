Posted: Saturday, October 10, 2015 1:23 am Virginia Tech defeats NC State 28-13 in must-win game Faizan Hasnany, sports   0 comments \nAfter last weekend, head coach Frank Beamer made it clear that the Virginia Tech football team would not be the same team that we’ve seen struggle this season. He backed up his words this weekend, leading the Hokies to a 28-13 win over NC State with coaching and personnel changes. \n“Coach Beamer has been coaching football a long time and I know he has no quit in him,” said NC State head coach Dave Doeren. “His players have a lot of pride in their program. We expected a very hard fought game and that’s what we got. They weren’t going to quit.” \nThere was plenty of speculation prior to the game regarding whether or not quarterback Michael Brewer would start for the Hokies after being listed as probable in the week’s injury report; however, shortly before game time it was announced that he had not been medically cleared to perform. \nBrenden Motley continued his solid play in Brewer’s absence throwing for 158 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions, while adding 44 yards rushing on nine carries. \n“He played extremely well, he didn’t turn over the ball, he didn’t throw any interceptions and that’s what we need,” said running back Travon McMillian of Motley. “He’s a really tough guy and he’s a leader.” \nTech got off to a slow start, gaining just 29 yards of total offense in the first quarter and going down 10-0 early. Things picked up dramatically in the second quarter however, with the Hokies playing arguably their best quarter of football all season behind 21 unanswered points and just two total offensive yards allowed to NC State. \nWide receiver Isaiah Ford was the story of the second quarter, connecting with Motley for three touchdowns on three consecutive possessions. Ford continues to break Virginia Tech receiving records for the Hokies. The surging sophomore’s first touchdown of the game made him the fastest to 10 receiving touchdowns of any player in the Beamer era, doing it in just 19 games. Ford now has 6 touchdowns this season through 6 games, matching his entire total from last season. Isaiah Ford (1) celebrates with his teammates after a touchdown. Ford had three touchdowns for the Hokies all in the second quarter.

I think another offseason and he could be special. He is special but he could be really special.” \nWith the outstanding second quarter by the Hokies, Motley also became one of three quarterbacks under Beamer to throw three touchdowns in a quarter, the others being Michael Vick in 1999 and Grant Noel in 2001. \nThe Hokies also regained their footing on the ground, coming into the game with a different philosophy that paid dividends. Travon McMillian was used as a featured back and was the only tailback to receive carries against the Wolfpack, no longer splitting carries between himself, J.C. Coleman, and Trey Edmunds. \n“It allows me to get in a rhythm, and get a feel for the defense and what they’re doing,” McMillian said of the new game plan. “It allows me to see things a lot better now that I’m getting carries.” \nMcMillian led the team in rushing, gaining 96 yards on 11 carries, while showing his big play capability on a 59-yard touchdown run that served as a dagger, putting the Hokies ahead 28-13 in the fourth quarter. \n“I thought he did really well,” Loeffler said of the freshman running back. “I think he’s a dude, and we’ll continue to feature him.” \nFullback Sam Rogers was next in line for carries, gaining 57 yards on eight carries, giving the Hokies a change of pace with his downhill style of running. Sam Rogers (45) powers forward, carrying NC State defenders. Rogers had eight carries for 57 yards. Trevor White \n“I think he’s a dynamic player,” said head coach Frank Beamer. “People underestimate him as a player but he breaks a lot of tackles and keeps running. He’s always going down the field and I like runners to do that.” \nFrom a protection and run blocking standpoint, the Hokies offensive line looked much improved, only allowing one sack and enabling Tech to run for 200 yards. \n“As I told them today, I wish we had more experience. But the thing I think we do have are athletic guys who are tough and will get better every week,” Beamer said. “I think we took a step towards that tonight and I think we will continue to do so.” \nOn the defensive side of the ball, the Hokies were able to get exceptional pressure on the quarterback and cause havoc in the backfield, recording four sacks and 11 tackles for loss. \nFreshmen defensive backs Mook Reynolds, Adonis Alexander and Terrell Edmunds did a solid job in the defensive secondary, which appeared to be an area of concern when Kendall Fuller went down with his knee injury. \n“I think Alexander had a solid game, as did Reynolds,” Beamer said. “You have to bring those young guys along; we involve them a lot in run support but then they have to get out there and handle one-on-one a little too.” \nAlexander picked off NC State quarterback Jacoby Forsett who went 241 passes without throwing an interception, good for the third longest streak in ACC history. That interception was Alexander’s third pick of the season. \nCornerback Brandon Facyson has continued his stellar season, breaking up four passes, and has emerged as a leader among the young secondary. Facyson entered the game as the second best corner in the ACC in terms of opposing completion percentage when thrown in his direction. \nLightning and a downpour of rain initially kept the game on hold and the fans out of the stadium until 7:45 PM when they opened the gates. At that point fans only had 20 minutes to fill up the Lane Stadium before the opening kickoff at 8:05 PM. Nevertheless, the stands filled up with an official attendance of 61,183. \nThis win was critical for Tech which hopes to use it as a first step to get back on track and to playing the football that Hokies fans have grown to expect. \n“We beat a good football team and had the fight that we needed to beat a good football team,” Beamer said. “I hope we can take this and build on the execution offensively and defensively.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T21:46:04.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
