Here, Press Association Sport Formula One Correspondent Philip Duncan assesses the Briton's chances, and other key talking points heading into round 16 of the championship. \nLewis Hamilton can win the title on Sunday, but how can he do it? \nThere are a number of different scenarios as to how Hamilton can clinch the championship in Austin. He needs to outscore Sebastian Vettel by nine points and Nico Rosberg by two. So, if Hamilton wins on Sunday, and Vettel is only third or lower, that will be enough for the Stevenage-born racer regardless of where Rosberg finishes. \nHamilton can also win the title if: \n- He finishes second and Vettel is sixth or worse, and Rosberg crosses the line third or lower \n- He finishes third and Vettel is eighth or worse, and Rosberg crosses the line fifth or lower \n- He finishes fourth and Vettel is ninth or worse, and Rosberg crosses the line fifth or lower \n- He finishes fifth and Vettel is 10th or worse, and Rosberg crosses the line sixth or lower \nConsidering Hamilton's record at the Circuit of Americas, he is worth a small wager isn't he? \nDespite starting from second here last year, Hamilton won after reeling in and overtaking Rosberg. He also got the better of Vettel at the inaugural grand prix in Austin back in 2012, and he also triumphed at Indianapolis during his debut F1 season. He is popular across the pond, spending much of his time in New York and Colorado - and this week was courting the attentions of the paparazzi in Miami. He would be a popular winner with the American fans - but bad weather could play its part this weekend after flood warnings were issued in the Austin area following a tropical storm south-west of Mexico. \nBernie Ecclestone this week said Hamilton \"is given a hell of a lot of help\" and described Formula One as an \"engineer's championship\"... \nYes, while Ecclestone is a big fan of Hamilton - and particularly his celebrity status which helps to sell the sport around the world - he appeared to pour scorn on his fine recent record by speaking in rather derogatory terms about the current state of Formula One. In a mischief-making interview, flanked by former FIA president Max Mosley, Ecclestone called for the rulebook to be torn up, more emphasis to be placed back in the hands of the drivers, and the return of V8 engines. But his bleak assessment of Formula One is unlikely to have gone down well with Hamilton, who has won 20 of the last 35 races. \nHas there been any news from Red Bull as to what they will be doing next season? \nThe simple answer is: no. Ecclestone said in Russia that Red Bull will still be on the grid next year, but there is little evidence to back up his claim. The team's owner Dietrich Mateschitz said he will take a decision on their future by the end of the October, so if we take him at his word, expect an announcement either this weekend in Austin or the following race in Mexico. But with Mercedes, and now seemingly Ferrari, opposed to supplying Red Bull with an engine, their Formula One status appears in real danger. \nWhat's this about McLaren reserve driver Kevin Magnussen getting dumped by his team by e-mail? \nAccording to the Dane, the news was broken to him, not only via an email from Ron Dennis' personal assistant, but also on his birthday. As far as public relations go, it is another sorry chapter in McLaren's recent beleaguered past. After Magnussen made the revelation in an interview to Motorsport.com, a hastily arranged statement emerged from Dennis, the team's chairman, in which he heaped praise on the 23-year-old. To add insult to injury, the McLaren press release was entitled: \"A Fond Farewell\". Magnussen, who moved sideways at McLaren to accommodate the arrival of Fernando Alonso after one season, hopes to return to the grid next season. But with only two seats still to be confirmed - one at Lotus and the other at newly-formed American team Haas - his prospects appear slim.
