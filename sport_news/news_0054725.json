The reigning NCAA runners-up had their work cut out for them.\n“Starting last isn’t exactly ideal,” Cal senior Kendall Chase said. “We’ve never been here before, so we just made the most of the opportunity and did the best that we could.”\nTheir best was more than enough, as they upset favorites Brown and the Virginia, earning the Governor’s Cup with a time of 15:58.63.\n“We passed as many boats as we could going on,” Chase said. “(Coxswain) Hannah Christopher set us up very nicely for all the turns, and that was definitely a huge factor with the time.”\nEven more impressive? The curvy Charles River course was new to most of them.\n“Only three of the nine had been here before, so it was fun to see how they approached it,” Golden Bears coach Al Acosta said. “To see them approach this almost as novices to try to figure it out, and I’d say they figured it out pretty well.”\nThe title was Cal’s first in the Head of the Charles’ premiere event, a theme nearly carried over to the men’s championship eights. Despite pre-race hubbub surrounding the 2012 bad blood between second-seeded U.S. Rowing and third-seeded Washington, the real race was between Yale and Cal. When it was over, the Bulldogs clinched the title by just 0.68 seconds.\n“About halfway, everyone could tell we were on for quick time,” Yale’s Robert Hurn said. “We were really pumped up, so we went for it.”\nExtra motivation was needed, given the chilly temperatures, moderate wind and lack of practice time. The Yale team had only practiced together for a week heading into the race.\n“In terms of preparation, we go into this slightly underprepared,” Hurn said. “But everyone is really fit and ready to go, and wants to win the race.”\nExperience ruled the women’s championship fours race, which featured a showdown between a U.S. Rowing boat with several international medalists and a New York Athletic Club boat with five former Olympians. U.S. Rowing took a convincing 28.6 second win over the New York crew.\nFor the third consecutive year, Camp Randall Rowing Club of Madison, Wis., took the men’s championship fours race. Seeded No. 1, Camp randall held off second-seeded Cambridge University by just 1.31 seconds.\nClosing out the festivities were international team wins in the men’s and women’s lightweight eights. With 2015 world championship experience under its belt, the Canadian National Training Centre entry took the Boston Herald Cup with a winning time of 14:49.841. England’s Minerva Rowing Club took the women’s title in 16:39.276.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:24:23.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
