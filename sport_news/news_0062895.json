Theo Walcott broke the deadlock seconds before the interval with a close-range finish and Raheem Sterling added a late second to inflict a fifth defeat on the Baltic side and, all but arithmetically, end their outside hopes of reaching the Euro 2016 play-offs. They remain two points behind third-placed Slovenia, who face San Marino in their final fixture on Monday. England, already assured of their place in France next summer, dominated possession but the promise of an early Walcott shot, which was beaten away by Estonia goalkeeper Mihkel Aksalu, subsided as the well-organised visitors made life awkward for the home team. Walcott found the net in the 45th minute. England’s final pass had been lacking but now Ross Barkley picked out Walcott’s run behind the Estonia back line with a lovely pass through the legs of Karol Mets and Walcott tucked the ball past Aksalu from close range. England might have added to their lead after half-time. Adam Lallana had a free-kick saved by Aksalu before the lively Barkley drove a shot across goal after bursting past two men. Barkley, making his first Wembley start, came even closer in the 77th minute when his quick feet carried him past two defenders and drew a flying save from Aksalu. Instead it was Sterling who doubled the advantage, tapping in after being teed up by substitute Jamie Vardy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T12:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:06:21.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
