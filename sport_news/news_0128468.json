Emanuel Ericq Rupe, 60, of Sonora, was arrested and charged with attempted homicide after a shooting was reported about 8:15 p.m. on the 17000 Block of Valley Oak Drive in Mono Vista, north of Soulsbyville. Deputies responded to the scene about 8:26 p.m., according to a Tuolumne County Sheriff’s Office press release, and found a man outside of a residence who had a non-life threatening gunshot wound. The man told law enforcement officials he had been in a fight with another man, and that during the altercation, the man fired multiple rounds at him and threatened to kill him and his family, the press release states. Lt. Neil Evans, of the Tuolumne County Sheriff’s Office, said Wednesday night that both men were taken to Sonora Regional Medical Center following the incident. “One man went to the hospital with a bullet wound to the hand,” he said. Renate Mooney, who lives next door to where the shooting occurred, said Wednesday night that she was in her house when she heard more than five gunshots and people yelling. “Then I called 911,” she said. Katie Nemec, who was visiting Mooney at the time, said she heard a man and woman arguing. “I heard a woman yelling, ‘So why do you have a gun? What are going to do? You going to shoot? Well then go ahead and shoot,’” she said. “Then he started swearing back.” After that, another gunshot was heard, Nemec said. Rupe is being held on $500,000 bond at the Tuolumne County Jail.
