Posted: Friday, October 16, 2015 9:33 pm WVU hoping to repeat history today against No. 2 Baylor By Cam Huffman Sports Editor Register Herald \nEverything was going according to plan when Baylor arrived in Morgantown for a meeting with West Virginia last October. The Bears were 6-0, had just come from behind to beat TCU 61-58 in a shootout and were ranked No. 4 in the country. The Mountaineers, meanwhile, were 4-2 and still hadn’t broken into the Top 25. \nThe result, a 41-27 WVU victory, sent Morgantown into a frenzy and eventually ruined Baylor’s shot at the College Football Playoffs. The Bears’ only regular season loss kept them out of college football’s first Final Four. \nThe scenario today is eerily similar. Baylor (5-0) is No. 2 in the country, while WVU (3-2) is trying to prove itself after a pair of disappointing Big 12 losses to Oklahoma and Oklahoma State. \n“Last year going into this game, we felt pretty good,” said Baylor head coach Art Briles. “We were a 6-0 football team. We knew we were going into a hostile environment against a really good team, because we had been up there in 2012 and knew what the environment would be like. \n“We felt good going in, but they just outplayed us. They out-coached us. They did a better job that day than we did. We feel the same way this (week). We feel good going into the game, and our job is to perform and coach once we get to it.” \nMotivation shouldn’t be a problem for the Bears. Although today’s game will kick off at 11 a.m. local time in Waco, Texas (noon Eastern), there’s sure to be plenty of energy as Baylor hasn’t forgotten about last year’s result. \n“It’s important for us to defend our home turf,” said Baylor junior wide receiver Corey Coleman, who has caught 31 passes for 678 yards and 13 touchdown this season. “When anyone steps foot in Waco, it’s our job to run them out of here. They outdid us last year, so we have a little bit of an edge going into this game. We’re ready to get that bad taste out of our mouth.” \nLast year’s game was won on defense. Baylor came into the contest averaging a nation’s-best 52.7 points and 622.5 yards per game, and WVU, using relentless blitz packages to put quarterback Bryce Petty in difficult situations, held the Bears to 318 yards and 27 points. \n“They played the game they were going to play, and we kind of fell into what they were playing,” said Baylor quarterback Seth Russell, who watched that game from the sidelines. “This year, we are going to have to stick to our plan and do what we do best, and that’s scoring points.” \nWVU’s defense, though, could have something to say about that. The Mountaineers lead the Big 12 in scoring defense (20 ppg) and are second in total defense (342.2 ypg). They’ve forced a league-best 16 turnovers and will come in with confidence after their performance last year against the Bears. \n“I think we can blitz, but our main focus is slowing down their playmakers,” said WVU senior safety KJ Dillon. “We want to affect the quarterback and make him uneasy, but we do want to stop their playmakers, which is their running back and receivers.” \nThe big question may be if the Mountaineer offense can score enough to keep pace. WVU enters today’s game averaging just 36 points and 488.4 yards of offense, and it has turned the ball over nine times in the last two games, both losses. \n“As an offense, we definitely need to come together as a unit,” said WVU wide receiver Shelton Gibson, who leads the Mountaineers with 20 catches for 448 yards and five touchdowns. “As receivers, we need to do everything in our power to make sure that we’re running routes hard, blocking properly and getting downfield. We have to do what we have to do. \n“They have a lot of talent on the defensive side of the ball. They play basically how they played last year. They blitz. They play a lot of man coverage, and they force you to make plays and get open. We were successful on that last year, and we have to do the same thing this year. We have to make plays.” \nThe game will air live on FOX television. \n— Email: chuffman@register-herald.com and follow on Twitter @CamHuffmanRH Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:44:24.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
