While UK is still confident Labissiere will be cleared in time for the season, we can’t overlook what is currently being reported on the internet. \nThe latest comes from Gary Parrish at CBSSports.com, who has learned the NCAA interviewed Labissiere’s AAU coach just this week . The interview was conducted to look into allegations of possible misconduct by Gerald Hamilton, Labissiere’s guardian here in the States. \nJack Britton, the NCAA’s Assistant Director of Amateurism, Complex Case Review, called former Memphis AAU coach Keith Easterwood on Monday and asked a variety of questions about Labissiere’s guardian, Gerald Hamilton, whom Easterwood has known for years. Britton subsequently followed up with an email that Easterwood provided to CBS Sports. \nTwo of the questions Britton asked Easterwood via email are: \n—“Has Mr. Hamilton ever texted you asking for your help in finding someone that could advance Mr. Hamilton a sum of mony related to Skal Labissiere?” \n—“Did Mr. Hamilton ever inquire to you about how he could procure a ‘shoe’ deal for Skal Labissiere?” \nEasterwood told CBS Sports last November that Hamilton, after realizing the potential of Labissiere, once called and asked, “How can I make money off of a basketball player?” [ CBSSports.com ] \nParrish wrote about Hamilton and potential trouble with Labissiere’s eligibility around this time last year, before Labissiere committed to Kentucky. Even then it was clear an NCAA investigation would come, and here it is. \nFor now, we can only trust UK’s confidence in its own investigation into Labissiere and Hamilton. It’s been two months since Calipari addressed the issue, but that will change tomorrow morning when he speaks at UK Basketball Media Day.

J-Dub421 October 13, 2015 at 4:41 pm | Permalink | Reply \nI found this in reference to Keith Easterwood, the AAU coach in question, on a Tennessee message board from back in 2009. \n“this guy has a history of inserting himself into NCAA drama, wonder if the NYT checked into that: \nArkansas’ Heath denies any recruiting improprieties – Men’s College Basketball – ESPN http://www.nola.com/katrina/pages/110505/1105D02.pdf A lawyer for the University of Arkansas said the NCAA has told the school that it is not investigating the Razorback basketball program amid allegations of improper contact with a Memphis, Tenn., recruit. An amateur coach in Memphis, Keith Easterwood, said he had heard of contact among Arkansas boosters and basketball recruit Thaddeus Young, who has since announced that he will attend Georgia Tech.” \nApparently this dude tries to funnel recruits to Memphis, and if they aren’t interested in Memphis he sicks the NCAA on them and tries to start some stuff. chris gettelfinger is not walking through that door October 13, 2015 at 5:07 pm | Permalink \nIf he does try to get recruits to Memphis, it definitely makes sense that he would have it out for UK after Cal left and basically took Cousins & Wall with him, and then got Skal out of Memphis. Not Wall October 13, 2015 at 6:08 pm | Permalink \nWall was not committed to Memphis nor was he ever going to even consider Memphis without Cal being there. They have absolutely no grounds to complain about Wall. A couple other players said they were only going there because of Cal. The AD put a clause into their LOI allowing a release if Cal left. He didn’t think he would lose Cal because he was going to match any offer. Cousins was going to play for Cal wherever he was. mannnn October 13, 2015 at 4:43 pm | Permalink | Reply \nman i hope hes a good guy and not out to ruin skals college career or that thing last year wasnt as serious as he said it was…. this does not look good people Neal October 13, 2015 at 4:49 pm | Permalink | Reply \nThere’s no doubt Easterwood answered the NCAA’s questions in order to bury Skal. You can bet the family farm on it. catfan4life October 13, 2015 at 4:49 pm | Permalink | Reply \nAre we going to find a bridge to jump off of because they finally make a call. It seems they should have done this long ago after all don’t we want them doing their jobs with other recruits and schools? I think they are out to get UK like most of the board, but still they should do their job. I also think I remember reading a post of this board UK had a copy of an email that had been generated by Easterwood rather than Hamilton. If they do then we have proof with that exchange nothing untoward happened on Shal’s side. If not and he doesn’t have anything to prove it either it becomes he said she said. Cat's Other Paw October 13, 2015 at 4:51 pm | Permalink | Reply \nI would love for KSR to have one of the writers do an investigative article on NCAA’s frequent scrutiny of UK players — and the punishments, if any, thereof — versus the other top programs like Duke, UNC, Kansas, Louisville, UCLA, etc. This is getting ridiculous. Jordan October 13, 2015 at 4:55 pm | Permalink | Reply \nI’m getting to the point where I don’t care if he plays or not without him we’d be just as good because Isaac Humphries is ready to contribute right away. UKFan October 13, 2015 at 6:38 pm | Permalink \nAside from the fact that Humphries isn’t even close to being as good as Skal, I feel like you’re missing the point of basketball. This isn’t an “either/or” situation. Skal and Humphries can both play on the court at the same time if they are both eligible. So, in short, we want both players to be eligible and healthy all season… KT October 13, 2015 at 5:09 pm | Permalink | Reply \nI still don’t see what Skal did wrong not that wrong or right have much to do with NCAA investigations in recent years I suppose. 5 Knuckle Shuffle October 13, 2015 at 5:16 pm | Permalink \nAll you need to know about the NCAA is what they did to an incoming Baylor football player this year. The kid was homeless. Baylor had mercy on him and got him housing a little earlier than hey were supposed to. Kid is banned from ever playing. J-Dub421 October 13, 2015 at 5:24 pm | Permalink \nI thought what the NCAA did to Cliff Alexander/Kansas last year was pretty crappy. His family took money behind his back, Alexander didn’t even know about it, and neither did Kansas, but that didn’t matter and Kansas/the player are the ones who get punished. None of this will change unless the NCAA starts going after the agents, etc. who are actually paying people and committing the infractions. Josh October 13, 2015 at 5:13 pm | Permalink | Reply \nIf he’s ruled ineligible this will be the second time we have faced this situation. I personally would like to see Coach Cal stay away from these people who are questionable because when they commit someone else who plays that position may pass on us; then when our guy becomes ineligible we have a huge hole. Josh Harrelson saved us with E. Kanter, but sorry folks-Isaac Humphries has potential but he is at least 2 years away from being effective. This will be a huge blow. I feel bad for the kid because he just wants to play basketball. Critics of my argument may cite John Wall and how he was questionable but that was a different situation and Eric Bledsoe had already committed so we were fine regardless.

All thatbullshit at UNC and UL, and they are worried about Skal’s handler making a buck. Not Skal, mind you. His handler.

He could be a deviant trying to screw things up for that family. Hamilton may not be an angel, but what if he did “text” questions regarding a shoe deal or how he could make money off of a basketball player…..a text can not keep Skal off the court. It can only happen if a deal did go down….and UK is sure nothing did from their investigation…..agree with Mean Randy….Yawn…..moving on leon singleton October 13, 2015 at 8:26 pm | Permalink | Reply \nThank God We are loaded with good guards. leon singleton October 13, 2015 at 8:58 pm | Permalink \n27 and 9.
