(Photo: File) 6 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWith the basketball season just around the corner, the Dixie State men's basketball team has been hard at work as the team embarks on what could be another special season. \nLast year, the Red Storm won 20 games – the sixth consecutive year to win 20-plus games – and won the Pacific West Conference title for the fifth time over the last six seasons. \nWhile every year brings different obstacles and challenges, this season may be one of the toughest in recent memory as Dixie State head coach Jon Judkins figures out how to replace two of the most dynamic players to ever play in the Burns Arena. \n\"Zach (Robbins) and DeQuan (Thompson) are going to be hard to replace,\" Judkins said. \"I don't know if anybody could replace those guys. I was fortunate to have them for all four years and they seemed to break every school record while they were here. It was really hard to see them go, but at the same time it gives somebody else an opportunity to step up and we certainly have some players who are talented to do that.\" \nDespite the departures of Zach Robbins and DeQuan Thompson -- arguably two of the most dynamic players to ever play in the Burns Arena, the Dixie State men’s basketball team looks to reload again this year after winning the PacWest title five of the last six seasons. (Photo: File) \nIf anybody knows how regroup and reload, it's Judkins who's coaching resume – 470 wins – speaks for itself. \n\"We lost five seniors as well as some guys who transferred. So we have a lot a new guys on the team, but I like the guys we have and I'm really excited about the upcoming year,\" Judkins added. \nThree of those newcomers all have local ties to St. George. Walker Swenson (Dixie) and Brandon Simister (Desert Hills) both recently returned from serving mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. \nQuincy Mathews – who just graduated this past summer from Desert Hills – joins Swenson and Simister, and is one of the most athletic players that Judkins has seen in his coaching career. \n\"His athleticism is off the charts,\" Judkins said smiling. \"Him and Kyler Nielson (SUU) are both very coachable and they get better every single day. They're both so smart and are quick to catch on what we are trying to do.\" \nAlthough there are a number of newcomers on the team this year, Coach Judkins does return several players (Robbie Nielson, Mason Sawyer, Mark Ogden, Trevor Hill and Zac Hunter) who either started or played significant amount of minutes last year. \n\"Mark had a great summer and really worked hard on his game,\" Judkins added. \"He transferred here last year and really found a rhythm towards the end of the year. Now he knows what to expect and really has a leg up from where he was last year.\" \n\"I have some big shoes to fill obviously with Zach gone, but I've been working on my game and feel good where I'm at right now,\" Ogden said. \"I mostly worked on my jump shots, ball handling and building up my endurance in the off season. I played 25-30 minutes last year and this year will be even more so I'm just trying to keep myself in shape.\" \nDespite the departures of Zach Robbins and DeQuan Thompson -- arguably two of the most dynamic players to ever play in the Burns Arena, the Dixie State men’s basketball team looks to reload again this year after winning the PacWest title five of the last six seasons.

He just needs to keep out of foul trouble because he plays so hard. But I'd rather coach a guy like that, rather than a player that you have to motivate all the time,\" Judkins said. \nNielson, who played almost every position for the Storm is as healthy as he's been and looks forward to making a big splash this coming season. \n\"Last year, I was primarily a lock down defender, Nielson said. \"I've really worked on my offensive skills this past summer so that I'm a threat on both ends of the court.\" \n\"Every coach dreams of having a player like Robbie,\" Judkins added. \"He does everything you ask of him and does everything for the team. He's one of the most selfless players I've come across and it's nice to see him come in healthy, because that hasn't been the case the last few years due to freak accidents.\" \nLeading the way at the point guard is Sawyer who was named to the All-PacWest team as a junior last year. \n\"Coach Judkins wants us to get and run and so I've been working on changing pace and changing direction since I'm not the tallest or fastest guy on the team,\" Sawyer said about his training over the summer. \"We were able to get out and run last year and this year I want to make sure we really capitalize on that.\" \n\"Mason is one of our leaders that we will be counting on a lot this year,\" Judkins added. \"He's a scorer and came into camp in shape and has been playing well.\" \nInstead of relying on just a couple of guys on offense, Coach Judkins envisions a well-balanced offense this year with so many weapons on the team this year. \n\"We're still trying put everyone in spots, but the talent is certainly there,\" Judkins said. \"We don't have the height like we had last year, but we have so many guys this year that can play multiple positions and I can't wait to see what they can do.\" \nDSU's first game of the year will take place Oct. 29, against Arizona Christian in an exhibition match at the Burns Arena. Tip-off is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. \nFollow Justin Giles on Twitter @Justingiles22 or on Facebook at www.facebook.com/JustinGilesSportsWriter 6 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.thespectrum.com/story/sports/2015/10/20/dsu-basketball-preview-red-storm-still-team-beat-pacwest/74253436/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:09:44.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
