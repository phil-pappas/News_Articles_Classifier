Hirwani has been Vidarbha Cricket Association's spin consultant for the last few years.\nEver since his stint as BCCI selector ended, Hirwani has been travelling around the country and guiding budding spinners from different state associations. He has also been coaching at National Cricket Academy. He is a mentor to India leg-spinner Amit Mishra, who played a crucial role in India's historic victory in Sri Lanka recently. He has also been guiding Mishra's state colleague Jayant Yadav, who played a crucial role in India A's victory over Bangladesh in an unofficial Test recently, taking seven wickets in the match. Besides, all the leading spinners of the country seek guidance from Hirwani.\nVidarbha spinners are also benefitting from Hirwani's knowledge. Off spinner Akshay Wakhare had a great last season, where he broke the 50-year-old record of best bowling figures in a match for Vidarbha. Wakhare also picked up a five-wicket haul against Saurashtra, including the prized scalp of Cheteshwar Pujara on a flat track. The tall offie made a great start to this season taking nine wickets against Odisha.\n\"He has played for 23 years and has over 600 wickets. He has bowled to some of the best players of spin during his playing days. So, to get guidance from him is amazing. He corrected some minor errors and it helped me become more effective. It's not only about bowling but the mental thing too. His words do magic for you. There's plenty one can learn from him. I am more confident about my bowling now. I think it's a great initiative by VCA to bring him here,\" Wakhare told TOI on Thursday.\nIt's not Wakhare alone who has benefitted with Hirwani. Left-arm spinner Sumit Ruikar and leg-spinner Azhar Sheikh also learned a lot from him. Their improvement is reflected in their performance, with both Ruikar and Sheikh taking many wickets in local cricket. \"As a leg-spinner, I have always admired Hiru Bhai. He has always been very accurate and that's one thing he has helped me achieve. He corrected my head and body position, which helped me be more effective. I would use variations early on in my spells but he advised me to use them once I get settled. It's working for me,\" Sheikh said.\nRuikar is not only performing well in local cricket but he is also doing well in Times Shield in Mumbai, where he is bowling to some good batsmen. \"You don't realize when you start making small mistakes and that's where somebody like Hirwani Sir is so important. It was great working with him last year. My body was opening up during delivery. So he advised me to remain tall and that worked for me. I am spinning the ball more. The rotation of the ball has increased. You can learn so many things by just listening to him. How to work on batsmen; how to bluff them; how to approach the game and even how to approach different sessions,\" Ruikar said.\nWith no professional spinner now, Vidarbha will be looking to these spinners to deliver. After Preetam Gandhe, none of the Vidarbha spinners have made their mark. Hopefully, this is the start of a new era.
