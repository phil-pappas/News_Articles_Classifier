Lackey hit Greg Maddux’s outside corner better than Lester did.\nBut Lackey’s night was made easier because he faced a weakened lineup that was self-inflicted.\nLeft-handed-hitting catcher Miguel Montero smacked 12 of his 15 homers off righties this season and posted a .749 on-base-plus-slugging percentage.\nWhile Lackey had dominated Montero this season, Montero still remained the catcher with the best chance to reach base.\nWhat's more, Montero can call a game and frame pitches like a master --- like Yadier Molina did for Lackey on Friday. Ross isn’t the only Cubs catcher who can play catcher.\nFor $155 million, you’d think Lester could pitch to anyone. Should pitch to anyone.\nYou'd also think he’d want a better hitting catcher to get him some runs. Get his team some runs.\nIn the eighth inning, Cubs pitching fell apart against Cardinals rookies so quickly and badly that it wasn’t even a save situation.\nWhat game was the TBS pitch window watching?\nAnytime Bryant and Anthony Rizzo want to join the playoff fun, fine by me.\nIn two playoff games, they already are a combined 0-14 with three double plays. Lackey induced an inning-ending double play from each of them Friday.\nIt’s early, I know. I just don’t want to witness the postseason’s new Alfonso Soriano and Aramis Ramirez.\nMore managerial challenges in the playoffs. More TV commercials in the playoffs. More everything except Cubs runs.\nI don’t get letting left-handed-hitting Chris Coghlan face left-handed reliever Kevin Siegrist with one out in the eighth any more than I get Ross hitting, period.\nCoghlan hit .116 against lefties this season. Siegrist struck him out. Isn’t that why a right-handed hitter such as Austin Jackson is on the roster? Jackson hit .281 and slugged .437 against lefties this season.\nManager Joe Maddon cited analytics that said lefties hit Siegrist better than righties. Problem is, righties hit Siegrist better than Coghlan hits lefties. And it showed.\nWould Coghlan have caught Stephen Piscotty’s ground-rule double to right in the first inning that helped the Cardinals take a 1-0 lead?\nBut Kyle Schwarber looked like a vet running down Matt Carpenter’s drive to the gap in the third.\nIn his first at-bat since coming back from a thumb injury, Molina looked like he wanted to start at strike three. Then he swung at the first pitch in his second and third at-bats. That thumb must be killing him so much that he’s as little an offensive threat as Ross.\nLester throwing to first is still nyuk, nyuk, nyuk.\nI understand why right-hander Jason Hammel was put on the playoff roster in place of speedy outfielder Quentin Berry, but geez, are we sure Hammel can out-pitch Berry?\nJake Arrieta pregame tweet: “He stood 6’4 & weighed 235, kinda broad at the shoulder, & narrow at the hip, & everybody knew you didn’t give no lip to Big Jon. #BigBadJon’’\nThe video board in Busch Stadium reminded fans to show “why we are the loudest fans in baseball.’’ Yes. Well. If you have to remind them . . .\nBe a hero, Kyle Hendricks.\n Major League Baseball Baseball Jon Lester Chicago Cubs David Ross Miguel Montero Chris Coghlan", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56191313/turbine/ct-cubs-lester-lose-rosenbloom-20151010"], "published": "2015-10-10T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:09:28.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
