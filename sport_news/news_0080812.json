(Mark D. Smith-USA TODAY Sports) By John ShinnThe Norman (Okla.) Transcript \nNORMAN, Okla. — Penalties are the Sooners’ concern heading into the Texas game. \nUniversity of Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops hasn’t hidden his displeasure with OU racking up 38 in four games, an average of 9.4 per. That’s four more than last season’s per game average. \nDefensive tackle Matt Romar and defensive end Charles Tapper combined for three 15-yard penalties in one drive last week against West Virginia. \n“That was horrible. The D-line, that was mostly us,” Tapper said. A lot of hands in the face. I had a stupid penalty. When I jumped offside and threw the quarterback down, that was stupid on my part. I shouldn’t have done it, but it happens. We’re not taught that at all. That’s us out there in the moment of the game. We’ve got to settle down and let the game come to us instead of trying to force everything. It’s just a learning experience. We’re not taught to do that at all. That’ll never happen to us again.” \nFirst Experience \nFour of OU’s assistant coaches — offensive Lincoln Riley (offensive coordinator), Dennis Simmons (outside receivers), Diron Reynolds (defensive line) and Kerry Cooks (secondary) will experience the Red River Rivalry for the time Saturday. \nDon’t worry about the coaches getting too exited. \n“I know this is big, no doubt, but for us, you get there and you go play. It’s just a game, and it’s probably more for our freshmen,” Riley said. “That’s where going to play a team like Tennessee on the road helps, already having played a team like West Virginia helps. We played some quality opponents, been in some pretty heated atmospheres, and I know this one is going to be very heated as well.” \nShould’ve Been A Flag \nStoops said the Big 12 office informed him the helmet-to-helmet hit on wide receiver Dede Westbrook by West Virginia safety Karl Joseph was illegal. \n“They ruled it should have been targeting because it’s above the shoulder, and it’s at the neck area,” Stoops said. \nJoseph was not flagged on the play. Unfortunately for the Mountaineers, Joseph suffered a season-ending knee injury this week in practice. \n“I heard that and I hate it,” Stoops said. “I’m saddened for him because he’s an excellent player. I found myself watching Saturday watching him a few times and just appreciating what a good player he is. Not just on the interception but over and over. He’s a really good player. I’m sorry for him and that will be a blow to them because he’s an excellent player.” \nSmallwood Returns \nSophomore wide receiver Jordan Smallwood returned to practice this week. He’s been out since suffering a torn ACL in the spring. \n“He’s practicing. If he’s prepared to play or not, we’ll see,” Stoops said. “He’s released, so he’s been out there and practicing and doing things. How up to speed he is, we’ll see. Other guys have been doing well, but we want to try to get him back in there.” \nNational Award For Striker \nLinebacker Eric Striker was named the AutoNation National Defensive Player of the Week by the Football Writers Association of America. \nStriker matched career highs with 12 tackles and three tackles for loss, and registered two sacks and a forced fumble against West Virginia. \nWhere’d The Wedge Come From?: \nOU special teams coordinator Jay Boulware said the penalty called for forming a wedge on a kick return against West Virginia was warranted. \n“Our guys were close. They weren’t shoe to shoe, arm to arm or anything like that but they were too close. So it’s a good call,” he said. “I hope they continue to call that for everybody down the road because it makes the game safer and we’re going to do a better job of coaching that and making sure our guys don’t do it.” \nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:40:53.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
