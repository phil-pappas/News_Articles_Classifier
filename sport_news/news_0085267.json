Yet, when the dust settled on the PSAL season, the Knights had advanced all the way to the Garden, where they lost to Lincoln in the city championship final.\nThat run typified a borough that continually defied convention. Touted Wings Academy fell in the second round of the PSAL 'AA' playoffs, but Scanlan, which went 6-15 in the regular season, nearly upended Blessed Sacrament in the CHSAA 'B' final.\nAnd while it's technically located a bit north of the borough, Iona Prep's season proved impossible to ignore. The New Rochelle school captured the CHSAA 'A' title while its coach, Vic Quirolo , was in the hospital, resting after an emergency appendectomy.\nFIRST TEAM MICHAEL ALVARADO , All Hallows The 6-2 junior guard, who has verbally committed to Manhattan , averaged 13.2 points per game and nearly willed the Gaels to a CHSAA 'AA' Intersectional upset of Rice.\nSIDIKI JOHNSON , St. Raymond Sophomore's 11.3 ppg barely show his true impact. The 6-8 forward dominated the glass and was a \"defensive monster,\" according to Ravens coach Oliver Antigua .\nNAQUAN PIERCE , Kennedy Whatever Kennedy needed, the junior guard did. He averaged 6.5 assists per game and exploded for 40 points to will the Knights past McKee/SI Tech in the PSAL quarterfinals.\nBRIAN VOELKEL , Iona Prep The junior forward may not have been the most gifted Gael, but he led the team in scoring (15.4 ppg) and emerged as the squad's emotional leader.\nDASHAUN WIGGINS , Wings Few players in the borough could knife into the lane as easily as this junior guard, who averaged 19.4 ppg.\nJOHNNY MATHIS , coach, Kennedy The 22nd-year coach recorded his 500th career win in February, just one highlight in a season that saw Mathis guide a largely anonymous crew of Knights to a 27-2 record and a berth in the PSAL title game.\nSECOND TEAM Pete Aguilar (Mount St. Michael), Ronald Baker (Wings), Tyreak Johnson (St. Raymond), Jeffrey Short (Kennedy), Rashawn Stores (All Hallows)\nHONORABLE MENTION Jordon Bronner (Iona Prep), Sandro Carissimo (Iona Prep), David Love (Gompers), Harold McBride (St. Raymond), Brandon Stolz (Truman), Will Williams (Mount St. Michael)\nGIRLS If only they could have scored a few more buckets. When the Bronx Science Wolverines left the court after a bruising 56-52 PSAL 'A' semifinal loss to eventual champion Baruch College Campus, that's all they were thinking.\nPace for News Fieldston's Jacqueline Schoninger Similar regrets were on the minds of seemingly every borough squad in a season that saw Bronx teams fall just shy of their goals. Kennedy came within a layup of the PSAL 'AA' final, losing to South Shore, 35-33, in the semis, and Aquinas lost by just nine in the state Catholic 'B' title game.\nSuch setbacks did little, however, to tarnish the accomplishments of the borough's standouts.\nFIRST TEAM KAYDINE BENT, Truman Broad-shouldered senior forward averaged 14.3 points and 16.9 rebounds per game and single-handedly led the Mustangs to a 47-30 upset of Kennedy in the regular-season finale.\nROBYN JENKINS , Kennedy Jenkins, whom Knights coach O'Neil Glenn called \"the heart and soul of my team,\" regularly hit clutch shots and keyed the team to a 47-34 upset of Manhattan Center in the PSAL 'AA' quarterfinals.\nJACQUELINE SCHONINGER , Fieldston Injuries seemed to be the only thing that could slow her down. The junior guard averaged 18.9 ppg and shot 62% from three-point range after missing a handful of early-season games.\nTEARA SHAW , Kennedy Knights' lone offensive threat averaged 12.5 ppg and scored 17 points as Kennedy upset powerful Manhattan Center in the PSAL 'AA' quarterfinals.\nLATASIA WARD, Wings Junior guard scored 23.0 ppg, teaming with sophomore center Rykema Stone to give Wings a dangerous one-two offensive punch.\nO'NEIL GLENN, coach, Kennedy Helped Kennedy reach the PSAL 'AA' semifinals for the third straight season and upset Manhattan Center twice, despite a young roster that had few offensive threats.\nSECOND TEAM Stephanie Dowe (Spellman), Pearl Mensah (Spellman), Elsie Ndema ( Jane Addams ), Sarah Smith-Ocran (Clinton), Nishi Tavernier (Bronx Science)\nHONORABLE MENTION Troi Melton (Spellman), Taylor Murtaugh (Bronx Science), Sajidah Pressley (Truman), Alessandra Rosso (St. Catharine), Asia Wheeler ( Columbus )\nRelated Gallery: View Gallery Related News Daily News' All-Brooklyn boys and girls high school basketball teams Daily News' All-Manhattan boys and girls high school basketball teams Daily News' All-Queens boys and girls high school basketball teams Daily News' All-Staten Island boys and girls high school basketball teams", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:16:59.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
