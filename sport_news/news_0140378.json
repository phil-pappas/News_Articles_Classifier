The Community Health Center of Southeast Kansas (CHC/SEK) is now offering the flu vaccine for all ages and encourages getting it sooner rather than later.\nThe Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that although the flu season typically peaks between December and February, it is unpredictable and outbreaks can occur as early as October or as late as May.\n“It takes about two weeks after vaccination for the antibodies to develop in the body,” said Dr. Linda Bean, CHC/SEK Chief Medical Officer. “We are encouraging everyone to get the vaccination now so they are protected before the season really gets going.”\nThe CDC recommends that everyone at least 6 months of age receive the annual flu vaccination, especially those who are at high risk for developing serious complications from the flu.\n“Young children, pregnant women, the elderly and anyone with chronic health conditions like asthma and diabetes are the most vulnerable,” said Dr. Bean. “It is particularly important for those groups to get the vaccination every year.”\nThe vaccine is available during normal clinic hours with no appointment needed at the following CHC/SEK clinic locations:\n? 3011 N. Michigan in Pittsburg ? 2990 Military Ave. in Baxter Springs ? 120 W. Pine in Columbus ? 604 S. Union in Coffeyville ? 1408 East St. in Iola ? 2100 Commerce Drive in Parsons ? 3751 W. Main in Independence Cost for the vaccination is $25 with no out-of-pocket cost for those with Medicare, Medicaid or private insurance. Children 18 and under who do not have insurance coverage can receive the vaccination at no cost as well.\nFor more information, call 620-231-9873 or contact the CHC/SEK clinic location nearest you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:32:22.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
