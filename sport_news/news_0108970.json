It gives the former Texas A&M standout his best chance to show what he can do.\n“I’ve got to go out there and help contribute to this team,” Michael said. “It’s a blessing to be out there. It’s a blessing that, like (the coaches) said, I’m going to have more carries. We’ll see once Sunday gets here.”\nCurrent\nThe Cowboys said leading rusher Joseph Randle still will get carries, but they have acknowledged a desire to take a look at Michael now that he is comfortable in the offense.\n“We feel like he’s ready for some more carries,” offensive coordinator Scott Linehan said.\nRandle leads the Cowboys in rushing with 289 yards and four touchdowns on 79 carries. He has averaged 15.8 of the Cowboys’ average of 25.8 attempts per game.\nRandle insists he’s ready for whatever the Cowboys ask of him, even if it’s fewer carries.\n“I just want to be somebody good around the locker room, that’s not always mad about this and mad about that, making sure that I’m not a cancer in this locker room,” Randle said. “So I’m not going to be the one complaining for carries and all this different stuff like that. That’s not how I’m going to play.”\nAfter five games last season, the Cowboys had 164 carries for 800 yards, a 160 yards per game average. DeMarco Murray , who ended up leading the league in rushing, had 130 of those carries for 670 yards in the first five games.\nThe Cowboys have gained 531 rushing yards on 129 carries this season, a 106.2 yards per game average.\nThey planned for a running back by committee approach after Murray left for Philadelphia in free agency. But Randle stands as the lone running back left on the 53-player roster who played in Dallas last season.\nDarren McFadden signed with the Cowboys as a free agent the day after Murray left for the Eagles. Michael arrived in a Sept. 6 trade with the Seahawks . And, after Lance Dunbar tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee, the Cowboys added Rod Smith off the waiver wire from Seattle.\nMichael, who, at 220 pounds, is a bigger, more physical back than Randle or McFadden, was inactive the first three games as he learned the offense. He played only one play in each of the past two games, losing a yard on a fourth-down run against the New Orleans Saints and gaining 6 yards on the third-and-1 run against the Patriots.\nMore Information Cowboys (2-3)\nat Giants (3-3)\nKickoff: 3:25 p.m. today, MetLife Stadium, East Rutherford, N.J.\nTV/Radio: Fox, DirecTV (Ch. 714), KJXK-FM 102.7\nLine: Giants by 3, O/U 45\nSeries: Cowboys lead 62-43-2.\nLast meeting: Cowboys won 27-26 on Sept. 13.\nNow, Michael appears ready for more, and the Cowboys appear ready to give him more.\n“C-Mike has done a good job,” Linehan said. “He’s worked hard since he’s been here.”\nBryant officially out: Wide receiver Dez Bryant , out since suffering a broken foot in the season opener against the Giants, won’t return Sunday, according to reports. Owner Jerry Jones had suggested Bryant could return this weekend, but he didn’t practice this week and didn’t make the trip to New York.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/47/8845769/3/920x920.jpg", "https://myaccount.expressnews.com/dssSubscribe.aspx?pid=495&z=00000", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/47/8845771/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/47/8845771/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/47/8845770/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/47/8845768/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/47/8845767/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/47/8845767/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/47/8845770/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/47/8845769/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/57/47/8845768/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-25T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:43:27.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
