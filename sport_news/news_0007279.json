It will be sounder even if he kept the same timeframe. It could easily speed it up, but if not, what you're always going to be worried about (is) if you wait another week maybe you've got less chance of reinjuring it or basically rushing it. That will give us more peace of mind on rushing it. \n\"He's shown exceptional in his healing. I feel the procedure and how he's doing gives us a good feeling that if we feel like he can handle the sensitivity then you feel like you aren't being too aggressive in letting him get back out there. That's the big thing.\" \nThe Cowboys are still hoping Bryant can play after the bye week when they go on the road against the New York Giants on Oct. 25. Foot getting better by the day...
