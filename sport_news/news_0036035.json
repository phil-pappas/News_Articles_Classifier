Longo, who has excelled all season on set pieces, found space around a wall of defenders. Her shot kissed the left post, ricocheted off Wolves goalkeeper Natalie LaTurner, and rolled into the net. \nWolves coach Marc Wilson said Longo hit a great shot that LaTurner nearly saved. Wilson asked LaTurner to come up with two big stops in the match, and she did that, robbing Alina Ruzicka in the11th minute, then smothering a second-half shot that worked its way through a crowded penalty area. \n“She did everything you can ask of a goalkeeper and unfortunately, that one gets in,” Wilson said. \nNeither goalkeeper had a lot of work to do. Issaquah had eight shots to Eastlake’s six, and Anna Miller made two saves for the Eagles. \nA dinged-up Issaquah defense got most of the credit for the result. Left back Kirstie Johnson and center back Kaylene Pang were injured in an Oct. 8 game, and Johnson played most of the night, but Colette Lertkantitham replaced Pang at halftime. \nSenior center back Madison Phan led the way to her team’s eighth shutout of the season. \n“We knew that (the Wolves) were going to be very active out in front, because they’re very tactical, very technical,” Phan said. “We had to just make sure that we stayed on our feet and work as hard as we can.” \nWith 15 minutes to play, Eastlake shifted to a 3-3-4 formation, but that wasn’t enough to get the tying goal. The Wolves had a lot of possession around the penalty area, but not enough room to squeeze off shots. \n“We were pretty fragmented in the midfield and we just didn’t have a lot going on, and that’s a testament to Issaquah,” Wilson said. “They did a great job of just man-marking No. 1, Lauren Jensen, and taking her out of the match, quite frankly.” \nEastlake has a bye Oct. 20 and a chance to rest up for its regular-season finale at Mount Si (7:30 p.m. Oct. 22). \nWilson said the Wolves had a good week with positives to build upon: The win over Inglemoor was likely their most comprehensive effort of the season, and they did good things in the second half against Issaquah that weren’t rewarded. \n“I think we’ll be in the mix late in the year,” Wilson said. “I think this is a good enough team – they know who they are, they know our system and style works. We preach it and talk about it every day in training. We’ve just got to execute a little bit better.” Other Stories of Interest: Alina Ruzicka , Anna Miller , Claudia Longo , Colette Lertkantitham , Eastlake High School girls soccer , Issaquah High School girls soccer , Kaylene Pang , Kirstie Johnson , Lauren Jensen , Madison Phan , Marc Wilson , Natalie LaTurner \nWritten by Neil Pierson · Filed Under Local News \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:43:09.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
