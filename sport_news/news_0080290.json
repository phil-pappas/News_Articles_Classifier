(WGEM) - \nThe Hannibal Pirates plan to wage war, Friday, with Columbia Battle.\"This is very important to us,\" said Senior Quarterback Jerry McBride. \"We know the kids, we've been talking smack. This is for bragging rights.\"Battle, ranked 3rd in Class 5, suffered its first loss of the season in week eight to Jefferson City. to only lost one game all season while giving up an average of just 19 points per game. McBride says the Pirates' offense is ready for the challenge.\"They're a very big team. We're going to run right at them and make them chose through our option game,\" he said. \"Pick your poison: Shamar (Griffith), me, or our weapons on the outside.\" Friday's game doesn't just serve as a regular season finale for the Pirates. It allows them to gauge where they are as a team before beginning the post season.\"Just to have a game like this going in to districts, I think will help us a lot and really let us know where we're at. It will definitely be a great game,\" said Senior Lineman Dylan Powell. Hannibal has not faced a state ranked opponent since beating Mexico in week four, so a good showing against Battle will tell Mark St. Clair's squad what they need to know. \"You've got to make sure everything is right, everything is correct and everything is hitting on all cylinders,\" said St. Clair. \"We're just trying to make sure that, Friday, we're up at our level.\"?Hannibal and Battle matched wits last season with the Spartans winning by two touchdowns at Porter Stadium.
