In artistic language, as theatre of absurd has often proved it can truly make you laugh. Alas, as Vikas Bahl’s part real, part surreal, part animation too, take on dysfunctional family comes together in the most absurdist fashion all you can do is guffaw. And wince in pain. Here is a family headed by an old matriarch (Sushma Seth) presiding over a crumbling legacy. She lords over her three sons, one of whom is played by the hugely talented Pankaj Kapur whose adopted daughter is Alia Bhatt and biological one is his real life daughter Sanah Kapur. Much of the tale revolves around them. One is fat and cute and being used as a sacrificial goat for a business alliance which comes in the garb of marriage. The other, Alia, is an insomniac who can’t sleep and hence can’t dream. So, daddy dearest creates postcard dreams for her. The action takes place at a destination wedding where you have the usual naach gaana, the hallmark of KJO films minus his characteristic stamp (read oomph). To compensate, you even have him conducting a Mehndi with Karan as a rip-off of his own show Coffee With Karan. Funny, surprisingly this bit is but only marginally. Otherwise all the gags and jokes fall flat. Even though Vikas pulls out all the stops and tries to create amusement here there and everywhere. But merry nothing is. Not this Sindhi family with a fetish for gold, nor the eight-pack stud, sorry eight-and-a-half as this groom with a naked torso keeps reminding or the mummy ji’s quaint antics. Like the forced bonhomie between real father and son (Pankaj and Shahid Kapoor) much is laboured. Not even a single attempt at caricature works. Whichever way you look at it---a spoof, a comedy, mockery or a meaningful insight on a serious issue about why should any woman be apologetic about the way she looks. Yes, we know Vikas’ heart beats for women. Queen proved that with aplomb. But here as the story gets sucked into the plight of insomniacs, the predicament of poor rich families, a fat girl’s dilemma, a loveless marriage, there is even an in-the-closet gay and much more you are left wondering what the film is really about. Yes, you clutch at a straw. For just a fleeting moment it has you excited. After all it seems to be turning the famous fable on its head. Remember the prince who wakes up the sleeping princess with a kiss. Here the dream boy who is a wedding organiser (Shahid) is meant to put her to sleep. Voila… but before it can transform the film meanders in all possible directions, at times you wonder did Vikas put on the camera while the stars were taking a break from the shoot. Perhaps, had he, the results would have been far more hilarious. The singular redeeming feature in the film is Pankaj’s daughter Sanah who makes an assuring debut amidst the mess. Here is yet another value addition to the talented family. But sorry neither the gifted family nor Alia’s irrepressible energy can keep things rolling… let alone make laughter happen. In this fun film the biggest casualty is that alone. Actually only the actors seem to be having fun; at your expense should you choose not to ignore it. Our advice--run in opposite direction, unless you need to catch up on sleep. For this tale of insomniacs does have the potential to put you to sleep. Did the producer-director have inkling where the movie was headed? Why else would they play the song ‘Raita fail gaya’ that best summarises the film. Sure we admire their dare…. But that’s all that one can appreciate… a brave attempt gone all awry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:37:51.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
