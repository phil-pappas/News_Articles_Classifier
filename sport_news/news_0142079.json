San Antonio. That took a turn last year when the Mounties upset the Tigers in the Southern California championship game, ending the Tigers’ 30-game home win streak, and went on to celebrate another state title.\nThe teams met again Saturday night, and for the second straight year, the Mounties slowed the Tiger scoring punch and did just enough on the offensive end for a 20-17 victory.\nRCC had won three of four meetings prior to last year’s SoCal title game, but the Mounties have now won two straight.\n“I don’t get caught up in that at all,” RCC coach Tom Craft said of the rivalry. “Each game is different.”\nThe Tigers (5-2, 2-1) struggled in the first half on Saturday, collecting just two first downs and 1 yard rushing. Quarterback Ian Fieber, who had a breakout game last week in a victory over L.A. Harbor, was picked off twice in the first half.\nEven so, the Mounties led just 13-0 at the break.\nSeth Acda, who’s become the primary running back due to injuries to Chris Anderson and Dontel James, was bottled up for most of the game. But Fieber started to find some rhythm in the second half, finding Alonge Brooks for a 9-yard touchdown, and then connecting with tight end Evan Rodriguez for another score on the following series to pull RCC ahead 14-13.\nRCC extended its lead when Julian Castro booted a 35-yard field goal with 13:10 left in the fourth.\nBut it wasn’t enough.\nThe Mounties (5-3, 3-1) came up with the winning play when Jerry McConico scooted around the right side for a touchdown with 5:15 left. Fieber threw his third interception of the day on the subsequent series.\n“We just have to push through,” Acda said. “We have to follow Coach Craft; he’s the one driving the bus.”\nCraft won’t make excuses for injuries, but it’s clear the team that started the season with so much depth is now stretched thin, especially in the running game. Acda said the Mounties loaded up the box and dared RCC to run. At 5-foot-8, Acda was the speedy third option when Anderson and James were healthy, now he’s the lone option. He finished with 15 yards on 14 carries. Anderson did get seven rushes, but was held to 16 yards.\n“We played very poorly the first half,” Craft said. “We did a much better job in the second half. We put our defense on the field way too much, and I was shocked we were able stay in it. … “We still hold our own destiny.”\nThings don’t get any easier next week when RCC hosts unbeaten and state No. 1 Long Beach City.\nContact the writer: asteele@pe.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:24:26.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
