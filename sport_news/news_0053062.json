The selfie photo “craze” that has been ongoing for a decade or more has created more problems with wildlife than anyone can count. People do not realize that animals in the wild are not just unusual pets not currently connected to someone’s leash. They are wild, and every one of them, from the smallest ground squirrels to bison, can be dangerous if not treated with respect. The proof of adverse interactions between people and wildlife can be found all over the Internet. Electronic destinations like YouTube are rife with examples. If you want to see people being stupid with deer, or elk, or bison, or bears, or just about any other animal species, you will find examples aplenty. You can laugh at the silliness of humans, or you can cry at the stupidity of humans. But there is another group of people that apparently hold some species of wildlife in utter contempt. One prime example is a video taken at Ostional Beach, Costa Rica. It shows a callous human-group contempt for one of the most endangered sea turtle species, the olive ridley. This sea turtle refuge was created in 1984 to protect one of the world's most important nesting sites of the olive ridley sea turtle. Only this species and its close relative, the Kemp’s ridley, synchronize their nesting in mass emergences or \"arribadas,\" the Spanish word for arrivals. Here is their basic unique biology. A week or so before the mass nesting, usually during the rainy season, the turtles congregate just offshore. Then, after receiving some kind of (unknown) signal, the arribada begins. Usually the migration begins slowly and builds for four to eight days. Many thousands of turtles will lay their eggs on a one mile stretch of beach during these periods. Now for the video. It shows hundreds of “curious” tourists on the beach as the turtles are trying to dig their nest holes. And the tourists are standing in the way of migrating turtles, touching them, stomping on nests, and even attempting to either stand on them or place children on them for photos. Unfortunately many turtles were observed returning to the water without laying any eggs. Regulations for beach goers are clear. They are only permitted to enter this beach with a licensed tour guide. But most of the people in this video entered the turtle refuge at unauthorized access points. The two park rangers assigned to guard the refuge were assisted by three National police officers, but they were overwhelmed by the crush of trespassers. This situation is not by any means an isolated incident. It actually occurs many times in many different locations. I have seen these kinds of videos from various parts of Africa, Asia, Australia and Europe. But most troubling, there are many videos of similar situations right here in America. Many come from Yellowstone National Park, but there are plenty more from Alaska to Estes Park, Colo. Is there a remedy to this type of activity? Probably not. Many people visiting rural areas are raised in urban areas, and they often fail to understand why they cannot do something that they see no harm in doing. In the case of the sea turtles, they do not realize the delicate balance in the breeding cycle that they are interrupting. Since their activity does not harm themselves, then what harm could there possibly be? With respect to people getting too close to dangerous wild animals, I have little sympathy for their stupidity. One video shows a person being bitten on the hand by a ground squirrel after teasing that animal. I admit that I smiled at that one. But videos of bison or elk goring stupid humans makes me sad because I know the animal will almost always get the blame. Oh well. * * * Around here we have an over-population of gray squirrels in three color phases, which is great from my point of view. And who hasn’t watched one of those critters bury a nut? After all, they can return to it later, smell it, and dig it up, right? Wrong! Squirrels actually remember where they buried each of their nuts. Bob Henke, a retired DEC officer, bee keeper, farmer and noted outdoors writer (noted mostly by his wife, I might add) jogged my memory with one of his recent columns. It concerned squirrels and their unbelievable ability to remember where they “planted” every nut they buried. Some time ago I read a research paper from Cornell Univ. on this subject. It seems Bob had read the same article. Since I no longer possess that literature, I will attribute all of the following facts to Bob. Gray squirrels bury thousands of nuts each year because they need around two pounds per week during cold weather. Their primary range is around seven acres, and they use it all during their nut-burying routine. Once the aromatic husk has been removed, they hide each nut separately over their range, a process called “scatter-hoarding.” After a nut has been buried, the squirrel takes great pains to remove all signs of the excavation, even to the point of replacing leaves individually. This is important because other squirrels are constantly trying to find and steal any nuts of another squirrel that they can find. These critters also make fake caches with empty holes and sloppy camouflage to fool other squirrels. And they will also dig up a nut and re-bury it elsewhere after a week or so, further adding to the difficulty other squirrels will have if they are trying to steal nuts. To boil it down to one fact, the “spacial memory” that every gray squirrel has and most employ is simply unimaginable to anyone who doesn’t know the research. Thousands of nuts buried over seven acres and remembered by a fur-ball with a pea-brain just does not seem possible, and yet it is proven fact. So thanks, Bob, for that memory jog.
