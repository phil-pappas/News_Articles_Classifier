(Matthew Sprague - The Berkshire Eagle) \nNORTH ADAMS — Bob LeClair never got comfortable Saturday afternoon, even in victory. \nThe McCann Tech football coach had seen his defense shut down Pathfinder in a 20-0 home win, sure, but it wasn't without plenty of miscues. \n\"It just didn't seem to have, for me, any rhythm whatsoever ... and flow to the game,\" LeClair said. \nIn a game that saw the teams combine for 20 penalties and 220 penalty yards — 10 flags and 110 yards each way — the Hornets got the key plays when they were needed to remain unbeaten this season and take control of the top spot in the Tri-County League. \nDakota Bolte rushed for 55 yards and the game's first score, and Nick Lincoln added 54 on the ground with a touchdown for McCann (4-0). The Hornets' offense, though, needed the defense to provide them with a momentum-swinging stop before it could get anything going late in the first half. \nMidway through the second quarter, with neither side even having gained a first down to that point, Pathfinder faced a fourth-and-1 near midfield. Quarterback Andrew Roman set up in punt formation, but took the snap toward his own sideline on a fake. \nMcCann defenders hemmed him in enough, though, that Roman stepped out of bounds just short of the first-down marker. Pathfinder's supporters were incensed by the spot of the ball, but their head coach supported it after the game. Advertisement \n\"I was standing right there. I didn't think he actually made it,\" Pathfinder coach Chris Pope said. \n\"We did our game plan. It's just that ... [the defense] couldn't get the offense going, so the defense was on the field way too long.\" \nThat turnover on downs set up McCann's first scoring drive, a six-play drive that culminated in Bolte's 15-yard TD run down his own sideline, breaking numerous tackles along the way, for an eventual 8-0 lead. \n\"One of the kids got me and I thought I was going down, but I figured I'd put my hand down, keep running and keep going,\" Bolte said. \nThe Hornets' good fortune didn't run out there. \nOn the ensuing drive, Pathfinder drove inside the McCann 35-yard line, but personal-foul and holding penalties on consecutive plays pushed the Pioneers back inside their own 50. With a little less than 30 seconds left in the half, Roman set up a screen pass, but Adam Dufur saw it coming, hung back and Roman's pass hit him right in the numbers for an interception. Dufur rumbled 41 yards for the touchdown and a 14-0 Hornet lead. \n\"I saw [a Pathfinder back] come out of the backfield and not touch me,\" Dufur said. \"I knew he was coming out too fast. I just dropped back and ... I was in the right spot at the right time. Just a bad pass on his part.\" \nThat was all the Hornets needed. Lincoln added a 7-yard drive for a touchdown late in the third quarter, and the Hornet defense allowed just three Pathfinder first downs in the second half. \nRoman passed for 77 yards, but that all came in the game's final drive. McCann didn't have any passing statistics — a would-be 60-yard touchdown pass midway through the fourth quarter was wiped out by one of many chop-block penalties — but it didn't need passing to win. \nLeClair, though, stressed that everything has to improve for the Hornets before they host Mount Greylock next Saturday. \n\"They gave Hoosac a real battle [Friday] night,\" LeClair said of the Mounties. \"They're disciplined, and if we're not disciplined at all, we're going to be in a lot of trouble.\" \n——— \nMcCann Tech 20, Pathfinder 0 Pathfinder", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:51:07.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
