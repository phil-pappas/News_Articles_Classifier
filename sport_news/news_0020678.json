Young, Detroit News) \nEast Lansing – Trying to keep track of who's in and who's out for Michigan State these days can be difficult.\nThe injuries for No. 7 Michigan State began before the season and they haven't stopped since. By the time the Spartans had finished beating Rutgers last Saturday, at least eight players who were starters in Week 1 were not on the field – and that doesn't include linebacker Ed Davis, who injured his knee the first week of preseason camp.\nTackle Jack Conklin (knee) and tight end Josiah Price (ankle) missed their second straight games while tackle Kodi Kieler (knee) returned for the first time after missing three games. He was far from 100 percent, however, and was in and out of the game against Rutgers.\nIn addition to the players already out – cornerback Vayante Copeland and safety RJ Williamson included – the Spartans saw four more players go down last weekend.\nCornerback Darian Hicks took a shot to the head late in the first half and didn't return while running back Madre London suffered what appeared to be knee and ankle injuries in the third quarter. Defensive lineman Lawrence Thomas also left the game late in the fourth quarter and did not return.\nDETROIT NEWS\nDantonio shoots down talk about South Carolina job\nThe most significant problem, potentially, was the ankle injury suffered by center Jack Allen, who was splitting time playing left tackle. He was helped off the field late in the game and did not return.\nHeading into Saturday's showdown with No. 12 Michigan, the status for all is up in the air. Coach Mark Dantonio rarely offers insight into injuries, and that didn't change at his Tuesday press conference.\n\"We're going to allow our players to compete this week, and those that are able to play will play,\" he said.\nWhen he was asked specifically about the chances Allen would play, he was coy.\n\"There's always a chance,\" he said. \"We don't talk about injuries, but there is a chance he will play; there is always a chance. It's life.\"\nIt has created quite a jumbled depth chart this week as each offensive line position lists two potential starters, as does running back, while tight end lists three, though that has been standard all season.\nDETROIT NEWS\nDantonio: No reason MSU, UM can't both be great\nHow Michigan State adjusts will be interesting. It will likely mean more playing time for offensive linemen like Brandon Clemons, Benny McGowan and David Beedle, while LJ Scott could get the bulk of the carries out of the backfield.\nIn the secondary, it means true freshman cornerback Josh Butler could be closer to taking off the redshirt.\n\"You always have a plan,\" Dantonio said. \"If so and so goes down, there is always a plan in place. That's why you work your 2s, that's why you recruit other players. So, when things happen, it should make your football team stronger in the long run, and that's what we are always looking toward.\n\"Do we gain something from a loss? Yeah, we do. Whether it's losing a player or losing a football game, you have to gain something, and you have to also gain from winning. We just deal with it.\"\nWilliams back in action \nThe injury to London and the fact Scott was held out of the first half last week led to Delton Williams playing for the first time this season.\nThe junior running back carried the ball just twice, but just the fact he played was significant. After returning from suspension and agreeing to play this season without a scholarship, MSU hoped to have Williams take a redshirt season.\nCircumstances have changed that plan, and Williams will now likely see increased playing time.\n\"I think you will see him in the mix on special teams, and we'll see him in the mix as a running back as well,\" Dantonio said. \"Depends on how he plays and how he's practicing, how much we will see him, but that decision was made based on the situation in the game and everything that was going on. I thought it was the right decision to make.\"\nmcharboneau@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/mattcharboneau", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:32:21.477+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
