Here are three lessons from the New York Mets. 1. The best way to find an ace is to develop one. In Saturday night's Game One of the NLCS, the Mets beat Chicago's Jon Lester — the man the Cubs gave $155 million last December. Lester is earning $15 million this season for Chicago while New York's four-man starting postseason rotation pulled in less than $2 million combined. More than the trade for Yoenis Cespedes or the return of David Wright, that rotation is why the Mets find themselves with the National League pennant. It is what kept them in games before the offense found its footing after the trade deadline. It's what allowed them to sneak by Clayton Kershaw, Zack Greinke and the Dodgers in the Division Series and beat Lester and Jake Arrieta to begin the NLCS. New York has accumulated arguably the game's best rotation through a wise first-round pick on Matt Harvey, a pair of shrewd trades for top pitching talents in Noah Syndergaard and Zach Wheeler, and developmental successes Steven Matz and Jacob deGrom. The Mets were able to bring those pitchers along on their own timelines, with Harvey coming up late in 2012, Wheeler in 2013, deGrom unexpectedly surging in 2014, and Syndergaard and Matz only when they were ready in 2015. In the process, they’ve held onto arms such as Dillon Gee, Jonathon Niese and Bartolo Colon, perhaps not cashing in on higher trade value to avoid rushing their youngsters. While the depth of the Mets' success harvesting young arms is atypical, it reiterates that the best way to find an ace is to build your own — the way Houston has with Dallas Keuchel, the way Los Angeles did with Kershaw, the way Toronto and Kansas City are trying with Marcus Stroman and Yordano Ventura, respectively. In 2015, Eduardo Rodriguez looked like the best Red Sox starter to emerge from Boston's farm system since Clay Buchholz in 2008. It's a nice start, with Henry Owens and Brian Johnson also showing some promise. Further down the system, Anderson Espinoza and Michael Kopech possess tantalizing arms that could grow into something special. It's probably not enough just yet to dissuade Boston from pursuing a frontline starter this winter, either in free agency or via trade, costing themselves a lot of money or a lot of young talent. The Red Sox hope they won’t have to do that much more in the future. 2. Never underestimate the importance of competent depth. When the Mets were shut out by Kershaw on July 23 at Citi Field, they could almost claim a moral victory: at least they had gotten three hits. That’s how bad the lineup New York threw out there against the game's preeminent starter was; a no-hitter or perfect game seemed entirely reasonable when Wilmer Flores, John Mayberry Jr. and Eric Campbell were hitting 3-4-5. The Mets were sinking, in large part because they hadn’t adequately prepared for predictable injuries to Wright and Travis d'Arnaud or the possibility that Juan Lagares would take a step back from a strong 2014. Page 2 of 3 - Two days later, the Mets dealt for Kelly Johnson and Juan Uribe from Atlanta. Although the smallest of the three trades the team made in the final week of July, it was the one that best addressed New York's problem at the time: the Mets needed competent major-leaguers in their lineup and on their bench. Platooning Mayberry in a corner outfield spot and riding Campbell until Wright made his eventual return wasn’t going to cut it. Johnson gave New York some pop from the left side — he would hit a huge home run to beat the Nationals late in the season — and Uribe could play third until Wright came back before sliding back to a valuable bench role. Yes, the upgrade from Lagares to Yoenis Cespedes was enormous, but so was the overlooked upgrade from Campbell to Uribe/Johnson. Often when fans construct next year's lineup in their heads, they ignore the necessity of depth, instead focusing on finding defined roles for the nine everyday players, the five regular starters and the key bullpen pieces. While the Red Sox have talked about compiling depth ever since 2013, they haven't done a good job of it the last two years. Brock Holt may have been an All-Star in 2015, but his best role is probably still as Boston's 10th starter — a guy who can fill in without a defined role. Owens may have been impressive this year, but with an injury risk such as Clay Buchholz in the rotation, having Owens as the sixth man starting in Triple-A isn't a bad idea. Matt Barnes, Heath Hembree and Noe Ramirez had some nice moments down the stretch out of the pen, but they should be looked upon as depth options rather than Opening Day options right now. Finding quality depth is difficult; good players don’t like to play reduced roles. However, with a slew of question marks around the offensive capabilities of Jackie Bradley Jr. and Rusney Castillo, around Travis Shaw's viability as the sole Plan B behind Hanley Ramirez at first and around even Koji Uehara and Junichi Tazawa's abilities to bounce back in the bullpen, the Sox better protect themselves around the diamond with depth. 3. The chances to win are rare. Jump on them. Despite a hot start to the season, the Mets had fallen three games behind the heavily favored Nationals in the N.L. East by July 30. They were farther back in the wild card to Pittsburgh and Chicago. They had just suffered a cataclysmic loss to the Padres on a late home run. Baseball Prospectus put their playoff odds at 30.8 percent; Fangraphs, with its heavier weight on preseason expectations, had them at 15.1 percent. That was the context for New York's deal for Cespedes. Perhaps a rational fan could have predicted that the addition of Cespedes, who would hit 17 home runs in his first 41 games as a Met, would help transform one of the league's worst offenses into its best. No rational fan could have predicted that New York's ascension would coincide with Washington's implosion, as the consensus preseason World Series pick played four games below .500 the rest of the way. Were it not for the unforeseen (maybe even unforeseeable) collapse by the Nats, even that incandescent stretch by Cespedes could have been for naught, could have been the difference between an 83-win Mets season that ended Oct. 4 and a 90-win Mets season that ended Oct. 4.

Even when the odds are against you, rolling the dice can pay off big. —tbritton@providencejournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:50:44.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
