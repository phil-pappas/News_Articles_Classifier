Eight of the nine teams that finished third in Qualifying are in the Playoffs. The top-ranked third-place side, Turkey, advance straight to the Round of 24, leaving the other eight to learn their fates. Those sides square off next month, to fill the final four spots next year in France. \nThe two-legged showdowns are set for November 12th to 14th, with reverse fixtures a few days later. The match-ups are Ukraine versus Slovenia, Sweden clashing with Denmark, 2014 World Cup qualifiers Bosnia-Herzegovina taking on Ireland, and Norway facing Hungary.
