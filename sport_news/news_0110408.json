(Photo: Michael Alvarez) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWe are down to the final four weeks of the regular season, and the focus is becoming a little clearer on the possible Central Section playoff brackets. \nHere’s one take on the five divisions feature Tulare County teams (there are no Tulare County teams in Division I): \nDivision II: Ridgeview (6-0), the 2014 Central Section Division II champion, is the heavy favorite for the No. 1 seed. Ridgeview is ranked No. 4 amongst all of the state’s Division IV schools by CalHiSports.com (state’s top human poll), and No. 41 in the state and No. 1 in the section by Calpreps.com (state’s top computer poll). Tulare Union (6-0) is where it needs to be in order to secure the No. 2 seed. But are the Redskins on shaky ground after junior quarterback Josh Guerrero took a hit on Friday? If Guerrero can’t go on Friday against Delano, Tulare Union is likely to turn to senior Elijah Dailey. Tulare Union should be fine this week, but coming up is the EYL Game of the Year against Porterville (Oct. 23). General thinking is that Tulare Union will need to go 10-0 to be the No. 2 seed. Lemoore (5-2) has a strong enough résumé to pass the Tulare Union (if the Redskins receive a blemish on their record). Dinuba (4-3) is the likely No. 6 seed. Projected seeds: 1. Ridgeview, 2. Tulare Union, 3. Lemoore, 4. Sanger. \nDivision III: Defending section champion Hanford (7-0) looked a bit vulnerable in its 28-26 win over Redwood on Friday. But the Bullpups are without two-way star Juwuane Hughes, who is expected to return for the playoffs. Hughes gives Hanford a game-defining talent that could prove to be a world of difference in the postseason. This week’s game between Madera (4-1) and San Joaquin Memorial (5-1) in Fresno should decide the No. 2 seed. Figuring Hanford will be the No. 1 seed, even with a loss to Lemoore. Porterville (2-4) made a surge up the Calpreps ratings with last weeks’ 61-35 win over Mission Oak. The Panthers are ranked No. 4 in Division III. Bakersfield Christian (4-3), Kingsburg (4-2), Tehachapi (5-1), Mt. Whitney (4-2) and Fresno (5-1) are all in the running for the No. 4 seed. Have a strong inkling that Fresno will receive a good deal of support if it wins the North Yosemite League title. Projected seeds: 1. Hanford, 2. SJM, 3, Madera, 4. Fresno. \nDivision IV: Chowchilla (5-1) is the odds-on favorite to be the No. 1 seed given its sound wins over Madera South (4-2) and CVC (4-2). Cesar Chavez (5-1), this space’s choice to win the section title at this point, was on track to be the No. 1 seed, but a 20-17 loss to Bakersfield Christian has the Titans in a fight with Selma (6-1) and Madera South for the No. 2 seed. If Selma wins out, it should be in the discussion for the No. 1 seed (that would include wins over Dinuba, CVC and Kingsburg for the Bears). Tulare County’s’s top hopeful figures to be Friday’s winner between CVC and Exeter (5-2). Don’t know if the Cavaliers or Monarchs will have a shot at a top-4 seed after falling in their respective Central Sequoia League openers last week. Projected seeds: 1. Chowchilla, 2. Selma, 3. Cesar Chavez, 4. Madera South. \nDivision V: Central Section is hoping Immanuel can live up to its promise. At this stage, Immanuel (6-0) is the section’s best CIF state bowl hopeful. The Eagles are ranked No. 4 in the state amongst Division V teams by CalHiSports.com, tops among teams in the Northern California region. Woodlake (4-2) is in the running for a top-4 seed, and is likely to receive one if it wins the East Sequoia League title. There doesn’t seem to be a team that stands out as a serious challenger to Immanuel. Projected seeds: 1. Immanuel, 2. Fowler, 3. Dos Palos, 4. Woodlake. \nDivision VI: Defending section champion RFK (6-1) is the prohibitive favorite to be the No. 1 seed and to win its second straight section title. Strathmore (2-4) and Granite Hills (3-3) are not on their way to being top-5 seeds at this point. Projected seeds: 1. RFK, 2. Avenal, 3. Tranquillity, 4. Sierra Pacific. \nRemember, all Central Section champions will advance to a CIF regional championship game. The Division I, III and V winners will be in the Northern California regionals. The Division II, IV and VI winners will remain in the Southern California regionals. \nSpeaking of regional championship games... \nVenue Wars? \nDeadline is approaching for schools to submit bids to the CIF state office on hosting possible regional championship games. Central Section commissioner Jim Crichlow said in a phone call Monday that he believes schools have until Nov. 1 to apply to be a regional game host. A school doesn’t need to have its team be in a regional championship to be a regional host. \nIt may come down to the CIF selecting the most ideal sites, and there are several venues in Tulare County that could accommodate a regional game. \nThe two stadiums in Visalia have distinct advantages over most of the Central Section stadiums. Giant Chevrolet-Cadillac Mineral King Bowl has the largest seating venue outside of Bakersfield’s Memorial Stadium to go with outstanding media accommodations. Groppetti Automotive Visalia Community Stadium has one of the best natural-grass playing fields in the section along with an adequate seating capacity. \nThere’s one school of thought that if Hanford, ranked No. 7 in the state amongst Division III teams by CalHiSports.com, wins the Central Section Division III crown, Mineral King Bowl could host the Bullpups in a regional game. \nRedwood could apply to be the host, or Hanford could work a deal with the Visalia Unified School District to rent Mineral King Bowl. In 2013, Bakersfield Christian rented the stadium at Centennial for its Southern California Division IV regional game. \nWhen asked if Hanford could apply to use its own Neighbor Bowl for a regional title game, Crichlow believed it would be be possible. \nImmanuel could use Mineral King Bowl as a site for a regional game. Immanuel is looking to make a bigger impact in Tulare County. This might be an ideal way to gain some attention. \nCrichlow did say that the Central Section has not discussed a possible hierarchy of stadiums within the section for possible regional title games. The decision to be a possible host is being left to the individual schools. \nNews and Notes \n• Star Power: Don’t know how many times in Central Section history that two players from the same league did what Porterville’s Isaiah Jones and Tulare Union’s Romello Harris during the same week. Jones rushed for six touchdowns and 302 yards in Porterville’s 61-35 win over Mission Oak. The 61 points allowed was the most Mission Oak has surrendered in an East Yosemite League game (previous record was 49 points by Tulare Union in 2010, the Hawks’ first year in the league). Not to be outdone, Harris shredded the Monache defense to the tune of 352 yards and six touchdowns on 28 carries in the Redskins’ 40-14 win over the Marauders. \n• East Sequoia League Surprise: It seems that the Lindsay Cardinals, under new head coach Matt Mendonca, might be a sleeper team in the ESL after opening the league campaign with a stunning 21-20 win over Sierra Pacific, considered the slight league title favorite in some circles. Down by nine points late in the fourth quarter, Lindsay scored on a 40-yard touchdown run by Jason Fernandez, and Agustin Valdovinos nailed a game-winning 45-yard field goal with two seconds left on the clock. The other two teams picking up league-opening wins in the circuit were Woodlake (27-14 over Strathmore) and Corcoran (9-7 over Granite Hills). Corcoran hosts Woodlake on Friday, and Lindsay hosts Granite Hills. \n• Romello Watch: Harris raised his season total to 1,542 yards rushing with Friday’s phenomenal performance. Harris ranks second in the state in yards rushing, and sixth in the nation (of stats reported to Maxpreps.com ) with an per-game average of 308.4 yards rushing. He is 851 yards away from matching the school record of 7,761 yards rushing held by Dominique Dorsey. He is 1,120 yards away from breaking the Central Section career record of Mendota’s Edgar Segura. If Harris continues at his pace, he should set the section record during the Nov. 6 Bell Game against Tulare Western. \n• Kudos to Selma : Coaching hire of the Central Section has to be Selma’s choice of Matt Logue. The former Sanger defensive coordinator has been a godsend for the Bears program. Selma (6-1) is off to its best start in over a dozen seasons, and has dominated foes on both sides of the ball. Since opening the season with a 38-28 loss to Kerman, Selma has won six straight by a combined score of 279-45, an average margin of victory of nearly 40 points per game. in Friday’s 43-16 win over Exeter, Selma forced five turnovers (four interceptions, one fumble). The Bears have the week off this week to prepare for next week’s critical tilt against defending Central Sequoia League champion Dinuba. \nCream of the Crop \nOne view of the top five teams in Tulare County: \n1. Tulare Union (6-0): Last of the Redskins? Starting on Jan. 1, 2017, Tulare Union can no longer use the moniker Redskins. Have to figure they won’t start the next school year with the Redskin nickname — tough to imagine changing the school mascot in the middle of the school year. \n2. Porterville (2-4): Panthers may not have the defensive prowess to intimidate teams, but when you have the ability to score 50+ points per game, you’re going to overwhelm most local foes. Can Tulare Western tame the Isaiah Jones Express on Friday? \n3. Dinuba (4-3): Emperors end the season with three road games — Kingsburg (Friday), Selma (Oct. 23), Exeter (Nov. 6). \n4. Mt. Whitney (4-2): Pioneers’ season could be defined over the next two weeks with visits to Lemoore and Stanford. If Mt. Whitney could earn a split, it has a reasonable chance at a share of the WYL title. \n5. Exeter (5-2): Monarchs have not time to fret about last week’s loss 43-16 to Selma. They have CVC coming in on Friday in a pivotal game for both teams. \nAnother view: Calpreps ’ rankings of all 18 Tulare County teams starts with Tulare Union at No. 1, followed by Dinuba, CVC, Porterville, Mt. Whitney, El Diamante, Exeter, Redwood, Mission Oak, Tulare Western, Golden West, Monache, Lindsay, Woodlake, Strathmore, Granite Hills, Farmersville and Orosi.
