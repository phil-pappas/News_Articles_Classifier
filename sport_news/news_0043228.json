Gary Kubiak took over a winning team in Denver and kept it going, guiding the Broncos to a perfect start through the first month of the season. \nThis is not all that unusual. \nA check of the last 20 years by The Associated Press showed that two-third of coaches who took over before the start of a season led their new team to a better record than the previous year. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:48:00.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
