Through his weekly film study, Quinn said Jones remembers how to react in scenarios and is able to make game-time decisions while going full speed.\nOffensive coordinator Mike Shanahan said Jones' mental preparation during the week is one of the reasons Jones excels on the field.\n\"He enjoys the meetings. He enjoys talking ball, and I think he's a fan of the game,\" Shanahan said. \"When you have a guy like that, he's really easy to coach because you can tell he's entertained by it.\"\nJones said studying game film weekly is one of the more important parts of training.\nHe said when watching film, he can see which players in the secondary won't be able to catch the ball or cover him well alone -- and he remembers during the game.\n\"You have to educate yourself on the defense you're going against,\" Jones said. \"(Coach Quinn) challenged us early on to get in a routine and stick with it. (I) don't need to change (what I'm doing).\"\nQuinn said Jones' mental and physical versatility to play in many different spots contributes to the daunting challenge of covering him.\n\"Anytime there's really talented featured players, it's always a headache,\" Quinn said. \"In my background, (coaching) defensively for years, there's certainly ways to say, 'how are we going to deal with this guy who can wreck a game?' and Julio certainly has that kind of ability.\"\nShanahan said Jones' athletic ability and route-running skills allow him have the ability to do anything coaches ask of him with ease.\nWith the numbers Jones has recorded in his five seasons with the Falcons and an impressive receiving season so far, the hype around him could be distracting, but Jones said he doesn't feel special.\n\"I feel like my teammates did a great job, so it has to do with them,\" Jones said. \"The offensive line is doing a great job giving Matt time to throw the ball and giving the running back protection and other receivers, as well running routes to get me open, and I'll do the same for them.\"\nDefensive threat J.J. Watt and the Texans (2-1) will face the Falcons at 1 p.m. Sunday at the Georgia Dome in their first meeting since 2011.\nWatt said the Falcons' offense poses a threat to the Texans' defense that is just now \"coming alive\" after their first win over Tampa Bay.\n\"(The Falcons') had a lot of success running the ball last week, and they also have Matt Ryan and Julio Jones. That's a great combination,\" Watt said. \"Julio's making some incredible plays. He's a great player.\"\n(c)2015 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (Atlanta, Ga.)\nVisit The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (Atlanta, Ga.) at www.ajc.com\n ", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1731752", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1731752&h=Attitude%2C+work+ethic+behind+Julio+Jones%27+success", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1731752&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:58:52.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
