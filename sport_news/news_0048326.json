The schools have only met once before on the gridiron, with the Arabians scoring a 41-14 victory to open sectional play in 2001. \n\"They play people we don't know anything about (in the Eastern Indiana Conference),\" PH coach John Broughton said. \"So it's hard to compare things on film. The good news is they don't know much about us either.\" \nMost of the rest of the sectional field is extremely familiar to the Arabians. \nIt includes four HHC rivals — Delta, Mount Vernon, Greenfield-Central and New Castle. \nDelta (6-3) comes in with the sectional's best overall record and owns a 5-0 mark this year against teams in the field. The Eagles open at Greenfield-Central (4-5), a team they defeated 33-14 on Oct. 9. \nRichmond (5-4) travels to New Castle (1-8) in another quarterfinal. The former North Central Conference rivals did not play one another this season, but the host Trojans are 0-4 against teams in the field after losing to each of their HHC counterparts during the regular season. \nThe final first-round matchup features Jay County (4-5) at Mount Vernon (5-4). The winner of that matchup meets the PH-Connersville victor in next week's semifinals. The host Marauders' lone loss in four games against sectional foes was a 29-26 decision against Delta on Sept. 18. \nUnlike in years past when powerhouse New Palestine dominated the field, there's no heavy favorite in this year's tournament. \n\"It's a very competitive field, and there's going to be some good ballgames out there,\" Broughton said. \"It's gonna be whoever plays better on Friday night that's gonna win it.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:47:56.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
