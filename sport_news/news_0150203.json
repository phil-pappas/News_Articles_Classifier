First of all when officers had gone to the government and the DGP in August itself accusing each other of misconduct, then why was no probe ever made in the case. We wish to know the reason behind the silence of the government over it for almost a month,” said Ashok Tanwar, state Congress president. Tanwar claimed that the spat highlighted the polarisation of bureaucracy. With the Chief Minister’s visit scheduled for tomorrow, sources say the higher authorities were busy trying to work out a solution to the IPS tiff so that he was not subjected to any uncomfortable questions. A flutter was created yesterday over JCP Bharti Arora’s recent visit to PWD Minister Rao Narbeer Singh, though she claimed that it was an official visit. Rumours state while one officer was close to Narbeer, the other had his affiliations with Captain Abhimanyu.
