Filmmaker Bhatt said the attack makes one wonder about India's democratic status. \"The attack on Sudhendra Kulkarni ridicules our constitution, shames our police, & debunks our claims to be a democracy,\" Bhatt posted on Twitter. Shabana tweeted, \"Deeply saddened by Shiv Senas attack on Sudheendra Kulkarni. Wish to talk to @uddhavthackeray and @AUThackeray but neither is talking my calls.\" \"Dear Shiv Sena, Throwing paint on Sudheerna Kulkarni doesn't make you patriotic. If you remotely care, help fight our biggest enemy- poverty,\" singer Sona Mohapatra posted. Actor Rishi Kapoor tweeted, \"Excuse me! This is ridiculous and unpardonable.
