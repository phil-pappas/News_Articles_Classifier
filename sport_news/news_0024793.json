Or flying another flag.\nHey, two overtime losses and a lead in the fourth quarter on the road against Green Bay is not nearly as dire as it seems. They’re an eyelash away from 5-0. Simmer down.\nYeah, but they’ve lost their killer instinct, and they’re one blown call against Detroit from being 1-4. Time to panic.\nThe truth, of course, is somewhere in between. But it’s time to face a sobering thought: The Seahawks’ days as a dominant, feared, intimidating powerhouse could be over.\nSEAHAWKS AT BENGALS » Photo gallery Full coverage Larry Stone: Are the Seahawks' days over as a dominant, feared powerhouse? Just how epic was the Seahawks' fourth-quarter collapse? What the national media are saying Pete Carroll 'baffled' after late collapse PFF: Kam Chancellor was worst in NFL at his position this week Larry Stone: Seahawks must regain ability to close out games Neil deGrasse Tyson gives 'scientific' explanation for Seahawks' loss Rawls scores on 69-yard TD run More game coverage » It’s a league, don’t forget, that’s designed to produce just that result, one built on the concept of perennial hope. The NFL wants to keep the powerhouses rotating, because that also keeps the doormats rotating. So everything is legislated toward parity, from the salary cap to the scheduling. So far, only the Patriots have been able to conquer those forces on a consistent basis.\nThrow in the inevitable fallout from that plague known as Super Bowl Hangover — forestalled by the Seahawks last year, but a very real phenomenon — and you have a team that’s suddenly became fallible. Which is quite different than one that will fall.\nLooking at the remaining schedule, it’s possible to envision a path to the playoffs. But the Seahawks are now downgraded from their former exalted status as a sure thing. They are, until proven otherwise, among the teeming masses in the NFL’s great middle class, battling to move on.\nAnd I wouldn’t bet against them proving otherwise. As a team that seems to need adversity and outside doubt, real or imagined, as a galvanizing force, the Seahawks have now created both for themselves. They have a history of breaking through such turmoil and coming out blazing on the other side. You need to look no further than last year, when they were mired in a similar 3-3 malaise, only to win nine of their last 10 and then advance back to the Super Bowl.\nBut right now the Seahawks are a team whose defense couldn’t hold a 17-point lead in the fourth quarter against Cincinnati, and whose offense can’t figure out a way to integrate Jimmy Graham. They have a formidable divisional foe in Arizona that already has a two-game cushion and could yank away one of their biggest postseason weapons, the home-field advantage.\nOne of their cornerstone players, Marshawn Lynch, is battling injury at an age when bounce-back is not guaranteed. Quarterback Russell Wilson is struggling to operate behind a developing offensive line.\nMostly, you have to wonder if all the distractions and allures that come with winning one Super Bowl and nearly another — endorsements, financial entitlements, a national spotlight — have drained just enough of the Seahawks’ vaunted fire and intensity to push them from the pinnacle.\nThe will to be great, and do great things, is elusive, and fleeting. Human nature takes care of that. The NFL tends to take care of the rest, by making it so expensive to keep your core players that you can’t sustain quality depth around them.\nThe Seahawks have hoped to get around that by virtue of superior scouting and continued shrewd player acquisition. But that’s an extraordinarily difficult route to navigate continually. You can’t keep churning out middle-round draft picks and undrafted free agents that turn into stars (though the Seahawks appear to have done it again with running back Thomas Rawls). Or if you can, you’d be in a very rarified group.\nThe Seahawks of this era already have carved their place among the NFL’s legendary teams. In 20 years, authors will be writing paeans to one of the most colorful groups ever to grace the landscape, a dominant force that ruled the league for a time.\nThe question is whether that time is still now.\nLarry Stone: 206-464-3146 or lstone@seattletimes.com .
