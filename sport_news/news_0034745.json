(AP Photo/Andy Wong) \nSHANGHAI (AP) — Jo-Wilfried Tsonga reached only his second final of the year after upsetting Rafael Nadal 6-4, 0-6, 7-5 at the Shanghai Masters on Saturday. \nAfter breaking Nadal to go up 6-5 in the third, Tsonga got to match point with a diving volley that clipped the baseline and then won when Nadal dumped a backhand into the net. \nNadal had been attempting to reach back-to-back finals following his run last week at the China Open in Beijing, where he lost to Novak Djokovic. \nTsonga, seeded 16th, had not reached a final this season until capturing the Open de Moselle title last month in his native France. \nThe top-seeded Djokovic plays Andy Murray later Saturday in the other semifinal.
