The unspoken fear is, at 31, the seemingly-indestructible Girardi may be starting to wear down.\nGirardi is in the second season of a six-year, $33 million deal that has an annual salary cap hit of $5.5 million. The contract includes a full no-movement clause through the end of this season and then a modified no-trade clause.\nHe has played all but five regular-season games for the Rangers since 2007-08, his first full NHL season. Tonight, he will tie Mark Messier for 10th place on the franchise’s all-time list with a combined 768 regular-season and playoff games.\nVigneault said, there are no plans to bench Girardi, not even with the organization trying to figure out how effective rookie Dylan McIlrath — a healthy scratch in all but one game this season — can be.\n\"Not at this time,\" Vigneault said. \"It’s not an excuse but it is a reality, those guys went through a long recovery. [They’re working] back into the players they’re supposed to be.\"\nDefenseman Marc Staal also had offseason ankle surgery and McDonagh had to recover from a broken foot.\n\"Kevin was playing so much better than Dan, we just made that switch,\" Vigneault said. \"I know he’s working at it. I know he’s watched a lot of video to see the areas he has a little more time and can make a better play. Right now, Klein is just a little ahead of him as far as performance.\"\nGirardi was a minus-1 in 19:29 in Thursday’s 4-1 win over the Coyotes and has just one assist in eight games. Prior to the Rangers’ current two-game winning streak, Vigneault identified the defensemen’s inability — as a group — to make effective breakout passes as a key factor in a three-game losing streak that yielded just two goals.\nBRIEFS: Henrik Lundqvist will make his eighth start of the season after stopping 34 shots on Thursday. Vigneault would not name a starter for Sunday’s game, though it’s expected Lundqvist will play both ends of the back-to-back. … Center Derek Stepan missed Friday’s practice as he continues to take pain medication following Wednesday’s wisdom tooth extraction and removal of two screws from his jaw. But he is expected to play tonight, as he did on Thursday.\nEmail: grossa@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:00:57.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
