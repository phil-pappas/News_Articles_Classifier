Almost all educational institutes in the area remained closed for the seventh consecutive day. However, several business establishments were open in the city. The national/state highways and many link roads were blocked at 17 locations in the district. Public transport wasn’t operational to a great extent. Sikh youths damaged a mini-bus in the city when the bus driver didn’t stop the vehicle. Intelligence reports said the simmering anger against the Akali leadership was spreading like wild fire in the villages. The panchayats of over 100 villages in Moga, the heartland of Malwa, have boycotted the Akali leadership. They have also banned the entry of the leaders of SAD, Congress and AAP parties in the villages. Many youths gathered at Bhaloor village in the morning and carried out a protest march against the SAD-BJP government on motorcycles, carrying black flags. The protest march passed through at least 35 villages, including Mahla Kalan, Hariewala, Nathuwala, Wadda Ghar, Chota Ghar and Langeana. It ended in Panjgrain village in Faridkot district. Similar protests were held in Abohar, Ferozepur, Muktsar, Ludhiana and Jalandhar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:17:51.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
