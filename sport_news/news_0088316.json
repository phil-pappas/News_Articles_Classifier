Stanford (6-1, 5-0 Pac-12) could move into a commanding position in the division if it beats Luke Falk and the Cougars (5-2, 3-1). WSU, picked for fifth in the division in the preseason, beat Arizona 45-42 on Saturday.\nKevin Hogan passed for 290 yards and a touchdown as Stanford beat Washington (3-4, 1-3) for the seventh time in their past eight meetings.\nFor the sixth time this season, Stanford’s opponent had an inexperienced quarterback trying his hand against a tough defense. Freshman K.J. Carta-Samuels, a former Bellarmine-San Jose athlete, made his first start at quarterback for the Huskies in place of Jake Browning, who injured his throwing shoulder last week against Oregon.\nCarta-Samuels didn’t look comfortable in the first half, completing just 3 of 10 passes for 17 yards. But he found his footing in the fourth quarter and guided the Huskies to a score, which he delivered on a 7-yard run. He finished with 9 completions in 21 attempts for 118 yards.\nUW tailback Myles Gaskin rushed for 108 yards in 18 carries, becoming the first Huskies freshman to rush for 100 yards or more in three straight games.\nGaskin carried on all five plays on a 57-yard drive to open the second half, including a 29-yard gallop. From the Stanford 14, he broke outside and scored untouched to cut the lead to 17-7.\nBut Stanford came right back when Hogan fired a 50-yard touchdown pass to McCaffrey. Hogan faked a handoff to Bryce Love before finding McCaffrey on the right sideline, where he avoided one lunging defender on his way to the end zone.\nStanford backup tailback Remound Wright again picked up many of the toughest yards, once even lining up at fullback before leaping over the line on a 3rd-and-1.\nIt took Stanford just three minutes to get on the board on Hogan’s 21-yard touchdown pass to tight end Austin Hooper. Hogan faked a pitch to McCaffrey and fired to Hooper, who dragged a tackler across the goal line.\nEarly in the second quarter, Wright scored a 1-yard touchdown to extend the lead to 14-0. The score finished a 90-yard drive, the longest of the season for the Cardinal.\nThree plays into the drive, Wright leaped for a first-down on a 3rd-and-1 play. Hogan hit McCaffrey for 24 yards, and McCaffrey broke off a 19-yard run to set up the touchdown.\nA 28-yard field goal by Conrad Ukropina to end the first half gave Stanford a 17-0 lead.\nThe Huskies didn’t pick up their second first down until six minutes into the second quarter. But their defense was as stout as expected, sacking Hogan twice in the first half.\nBriefly: With 987 yards in his career, Hogan passed Andrew Luck (957) as the top rushing quarterback in Stanford history. Moments later, he moved past Jim Plunkett into fourth place in passing yardage.\nTom FitzGerald is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
