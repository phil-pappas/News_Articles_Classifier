Posted: Monday, October 12, 2015 12:22 am Don't blame only Howard for Mountaineers' struggles By Cam Huffman Sports Editor Register Herald \nIf games were won by statistics, instead of points, West Virginia would be 5-0 and likely ranked in the Top 15 as it prepares for Saturday’s trip to Waco, Texas, to face No. 2 Baylor (5-0). \nThe Mountaineers have put up winning statistics against every opponent on their schedule. They’ve forced turnovers, made big plays on offense and player-for-player, scheme-to-scheme matched up well with every team they’ve faced. \nBut WVU isn’t 5-0. It isn’t ranked, and its preseason goal of a Big 12 championship has basically been crushed just two games into the 2015 conference campaign. \nAt 3-2 overall and 0-2 in Big 12 play, after a loss at Oklahoma last Saturday and a loss at home to Oklahoma State two days ago, the Mountaineers are quickly losing both momentum and confidence. And with two Top 5 opponents next on the schedule, it’s hard to believe that things are going to get better for WVU anytime soon. \nThe blame for the struggles can’t be placed on the Mountaineer defense, as it has been in past seasons. Head coach Dana Holgorsen made the comment after Saturday’s 33-26 overtime loss to Oklahoma State that although the defense played well, it wasn’t good enough to win. \nTechnically, that’s true. If WVU had given up 25 points in regulation instead of 26, it would have been enough for the Mountaineers to win the game and avoid an overtime. But those numbers are a little skewed. \nOklahoma State’s first seven points Saturday were scored without running a play when it recovered a WVU fumble in the end zone for a touchdown. Its second score came on a drive of just 28 yards after another Mountaineer fumble gave the Cowboys great field position. The defense could have held the Cowboys to a field goal there, so for argument’s sake, we’ll give the defense the responsibility for four of those points. \nOSU’s final points in regulation, a fourth-quarter field goal, came after a Skyler Howard interception that gave the Cowboys the ball at the WVU 11-yard line. The defense made a great stop to force that field goal, so those points really can’t be assigned to defensive coordinator Tony Gibson’s unit, either. \nTotal it up, and that makes 13 of the 26 points WVU allowed in regulation Saturday that were not the defense’s fault. Realistically, the WVU defense gave up 13 points, intercepted three passes and held a good OSU offense to 362 total yards, just 134 on the ground. Continually put in bad situations, the WVU defense — unlike the offense that turned the three interceptions into a grand total of zero points — responded to the adversity. It’s difficult to label that as anything but a winning performance. \nStatistically, WVU’s offense wasn’t bad, either. The Mountaineers rushed for 255 yards and averaged 4.2 yards per rush, normally a winning formula. It produced 443 yards of total offense and averaged 10.4 yards per completion, the exact same number as the opponent. \nThe Mountaineers scored on 3 of 4 red zone trips and converted three of four fourth-down tries. \nThe much-maligned special teams unit? It averaged 22 yards per kick return, 10 more than the Cowboys, and, for the most part, made the right decisions in the punt return game. Nick O’Toole averaged 47.6 yards on his eight punts, and Josh Lambert connected on his only field goal attempt from 38 yards away. \nSo where should the blame for the loss be placed? \nIf you check Twitter, Facebook or message boards, the popular answer is on the shoulders of Howard, the junior quarterback who struggled for the second week in a row. He turned the ball over twice, a fumble that gave OSU a touchdown and an interception that led to three more Cowboy points. He missed some throws, finishing 18 for 35 for 188 yards, and a couple times made the wrong reads in the run game. \nSince the start of Big 12 play, Howard is 35 of 67 for 371 yards, and he’s thrown just two touchdown passes, compared to four interceptions. He’s also been sacked 10 times in those two games. Those aren’t exactly Peyton Manning-like statistics. \nBut it’s also unfair to put all the blame on Howard, who spent the first six quarters of Big 12 play running for his life like a mouse in a cage full of cats. \nWVU’s offensive line finally stepped up to the plate with a little pass protection in the second half Saturday, and Howard responded by leading three scoring drives, throwing for a touchdown and running for another. Aside from the one fourth-quarter pick — a very poor throw — Howard actually played pretty well after halftime. He was 14 for 24 for 157 yards in the final two quarters and the overtime, proving that with a little help from the guys up front he’s capable, even in pressure situations. \nThe Mountaineers’ biggest problem, as it’s been since Holgorsen’s arrival in 2011, is a lack of discipline to do the little things right to win football games. \nLast year, WVU was last in the Big 12 with a minus-15 turnover margin and eighth out of the 10 conference teams in penalties, averaging 58.2 penalty yards per game. \nThrough its 3-0 nonconference slate this season, WVU was better in both areas. But since conference play began, the Mountaineers are averaging 109 penalty yards per game and have a minus-4 turnover margin. Both are Big 12 worsts. \nYes, Howard has contributed to the turnover margin, but he hasn’t been alone. Wendell Smallwood and Rushel Shell both put the ball on the turf against the Cowboys, and Smallwood also contributed to the disastrous Howard fumble that resulted in an OSU touchdown when he knocked the ball out of his quarterback’s hand. The mistakes, like the penalties, have been a team effort. \nDespite Howard’s struggles that seem to be all WVU fans want to discuss — and the young receivers and inexperienced quarterback that Holgorsen has continually used as excuses — the Mountaineers had a chance to win both games — against two of the Big 12’s best, both ranked and undefeated at the time they faced them — in the fourth quarter. \nBut it’s the little things that decide close contests. In those situations, the team that plays the smartest usually finds a way to come out on top. So far this season, and for the majority of Holgorsen’s tenure in Morgantown, that hasn’t been the Mountaineers. Until that changes, WVU’s position as a mid-level Big 12 team is also going to remain the same, regardless of whether it’s Geno Smith, Clint Trickett, Skyler Howard or William Crest taking the snaps from center. \n— Email: chuffman@ \nregister-herald.com and follow on Twitter @CamHuffmanRH.
