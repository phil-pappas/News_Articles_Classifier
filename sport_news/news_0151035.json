The Royals would stay in front the rest of the way. \nIn the top of the third, Kansas City cruised to a 4-0 lead, thanks to another run scoring hit by Moustakas, and a two-run single by Jonny Gomes. \nThe White Sox clawed back to within two runs, 4-2, in the bottom of the third, including a run-scoring hit by Tracye Thompson. \nBut, Kansas City staged a two-run uprising in the top of the fifth — highlighted by Gomes’ sacrifice fly — to put the game out of reach on this particular day. \nKris Medlen (6-2) started on the mound for Kansas City and captured the win. He allowed four hits and two runs (one earned) through six innings. Ryan Madson nailed down his third save. \nWhite Sox starter John Danks (7-15) suffered the loss after giving up 11 hits and six runs in five innings. \nTexas 5, L.A. Angels 3 \nThere’s no hope remaining for the Los Angeles Angels for a division title. \nThe Angels fell to the Texas Rangers, 5-3, in a slobberknocker in Arlington, Texas. \nThe victory reduced the Texas Rangers’ magic number to one to win the A.L. West Division Title. \nThe Angels, meanwhile, fell to four games behind the Rangers with only three games remaining. \nThat means the best the Angels can do is to try to pull past the Houston Astros for the final wildcard playoff spot. \nTexas — an improbable division winner, should it pull out the title — relied on several different offensive producers to turn back the Angels. \nIn the bottom of the fifth, Delino DeShields delivered a RBI double — which scored Elvis Andrus — and Adrian Beltre doubled home Robinson Chirinos, DeShields and Shin-soo Choo to propel the Rangers into the lead, 4-1. \nTwo innings later, Josh Hamilton lifted a sacrifice fly to plate Beltre. \nAlbert Pujols cranked a solo homer in the sixth inning for what would be the Angels’ biggest offensive highlight. \nPujols banged his 39 th homer, his most in a season since 42 in 2010, with the St. Louis Cardinals. But, barring an explosive final weekend, he’s on target to finish with fewer than 100 RBIs — he now has 92 — for just third time in his 15-year Major League career. \nDerek Holland (4-3) collected the pitching victory as the Rangers’ starter; Andrew Heaney (6-4) suffered the mound defeat.
