The Dallas Cowboys defense came out with a different look, one that the New England defense had not prepared for and, for the first four offensive series of the game, it was chaos. But football is a game all about adjustments and there’s no one better than Bill Belichick at turning things around in-game. Sunday was just another example. The Patriots overcame a slow start and once again showed everyone why they’re one of the best in the NFL as they powered their way past the Dallas Cowboys, 30-6, at AT&T Park on Sunday, improving to 4-0. “They gave us a few different fronts, a few different coverages,” Brady said. “They came in with an approach and I thought we settled in, made some plays to start the second half. We did play better.” With the win, Brady became the third quarterback in NFL history with at least four 4-0 starts, joining Fran Tarkenton and Peyton Manning. This is the eighth time in franchise history that the Patriots have won their first four games, the fourth time with Brady and Belichick. Despite a rough first half, Brady went 20-for-27 for 275 yards, with two passing touchdowns and a rushing touchdown. The Patriots defense had no such trouble. Right from the beginning, it dominated a Cowboys team without quarterback Tony Romo and wide receiver Dez Bryant. With the way the defense played, the offense could have scored just one touchdown and the team still would have won. In the first half, little came easy for the Patriots and the offensive line. Brady was sacked five times. He had been sacked only six times in the three games before Sunday. On top of that, offensive lineman Nate Solder suffered an elbow injury and came out of the game. On the team’s fourth drive of the game, with the scored tied at 3-3, Brady got sacked twice. The first was by Greg Hardy, which resulted in a fumble. Luckily for the Pats, Julian Edelman recovered the ball. The next sack came on third down as Jack Crawford got to Brady. That forced the Patriots to punt. On defense, the Cowboys started the game with three defensive linemen instead of four. “Defensively, they gave us a different look that we really hadn’t seen them do before,” Belichick said. “They played a lot of the game in a dime defense. Kind of a 3-2 look with (Rolando) McClain and (Sean) Lee in the middle.” Despite the different scheme, New England was able to adjust. “That caused us some problems, but we scored 30 points,” Belichick said. “I think that caused them some problems, too.” The Patriots extend their lead to 10-3, thanks to a 1-yard Brady keeper in the second quarter. Shaq Mason lined up as the fullback and LeGarrette Blount as the running back, but Brady kept the ball and scored to give the Pats the lead. Stephen Gostkowski, who kicked the extra point, continued his terrific season. He connected on three more field goals, including 57-yarder with eight seconds left in the first half gave the Patriots a 13-3 lead. Another casualty in the first half was linebacker Dont’a Hightower, who suffered a rib injury in the first quarter and didn't return. The Pats got the ball back to open the second half and Dion Lewis showed everyone why he was worth the recent contract extension. The running back made four Cowboys defenders miss, after hauling in a catch with one hand, en route to a 10-yard touchdown reception. The Patriots offensive line didn’t allow a sack in the second half. “I thought Josh (McDaniels) and the offensive staff did a good job, and the players, making some in-game adjustments to deal with the look they gave us there,” Belichick said. The Cowboys got their second field goal from Dan Bailey in the third quarter but, after that, the Patriots’ defense caused turnovers on the next two Dallas drives with a force fumble by Jamie Collins and then an interception by Logan Ryan. Edelman (four receptions for 120 yards) then scored on a 59-yard pass from Brady to give the Patriots a 27-6 lead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T06:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:56:59.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
