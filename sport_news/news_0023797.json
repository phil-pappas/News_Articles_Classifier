He was tackled near the sidelines and landed awkwardly on his left knee, which bent backward at a severe angle. As Chubb was carted to the locker room later, he was visibly emotional despite draping a towel over his head. Other Bulldogs appeared shaken, as well, at the injury to their star. \nThe sophomore was averaging 149 rushing yards (745 yards, seven touchdowns in five games). A week earlier against Alabama, he tied a Georgia record with his 13th consecutive 100-yard rushing game, a mark set by Georgia great Herschel Walker. Chubb entered Saturday's game as a fringe Heisman Trophy candidate . \nShortly afterward, Georgia announced Chubb was out for the game. Although there was no specific information on the extent of the injury, it certainly appeared he’ll be out much longer. \n\"We all love Mr. Chubb, Nick, and we’re sad that he’s hurt,\" Georgia coach Mark Richt told CBS reporter Allie LaForce at halftime, \"but I think that he’s going to be OK in the long run,which is great.\" \nHOW THE TOP 25 FARED IN WEEK 6", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:55:48.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
