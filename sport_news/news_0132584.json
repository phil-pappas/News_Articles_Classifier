No. 5 Utah facing an offensively loaded No. 23 Cal, hyped further by the presence of ESPN's College GameDay and a late start that promises traditional Pac-12 craziness. The Utes, following a 62-20 drubbing of Oregon, sat back last week and watched their ranking soar, now fully in control of their own destiny in the Pac-12 South. The Golden Bears have arguably the best quarterback in the nation and are 5-0 with a Pac-12 North championship a possibility following the Ducks' struggles. Here's a position-by-position look at this week's matchup and which team will have the edge heading into Saturday's game:\n  \nQuarterback\nTravis Wilson was a revelation against Oregon, shrugging off shoulder pain to gash the Ducks through the air and on the ground. He finished with four touchdowns and 227 yards passing, adding 100 yards rushing and a touchdown in the run game. He spread the ball around well, looking decisive and confident. The Utes don't want him to get into a shootout with Jared Goff this week, but the potential to build on his last game should have Utah fans salivating for the rest of the season. \n\nJared Goff is the definition of a prototypical quarterback. He's a top NFL draft prospect because of his decision making, size, arm strength, intellect and a long list of other superlatives heaped on him by national pundits. He has the seventh most passing yards in the nation, controls the ninth best passing offense in the nation and has thrown the Golden Bears to the 10th best total offense. Wilson showed moxie against Oregon, but Goff is the clear winner in this matchup. \nEdge: Cal\n\nRunning back\nWilson led the Utes in rushing against Oregon, but Devontae Booker was no slouch with 98 yards on 22 carries. He hasn't been the force of nature he was last season, but has a good matchup this week against a Cal team that surrenders 137 yards per game to opposing rushers. Utah needs Booker to help grind out some long drives and break off a few big runs to keep Goff off the field and take pressure off Wilson. \n\nGoff gets all the attention, but Cal's reputation for abandoning the run game is highly exaggerated. The Golden Bears average nearly 170 yards per game on the ground and have a potent trio of rushers between Khalfani Muhammad, Vic Enwere and Daniel Lasco. Enwere is the bellcow, carrying the ball 54 times this season for 257 yards and five touchdowns, but Muhammad is the player to watch. The track star, who comes on in relief, has 350 yards on only 39 carries, an average of nine yards per tote. Still, assuming Booker is Booker, the Utes have an edge here. \n\nEdge: Utah\n\nWide receivers\nOne of the most promising subplots of the Oregon game was the emergence of Kenneth Scott, whom the Utes struggled to get involved in the passing game the first few weeks of the season. Scott finished with six receptions for 75 yards and a score, opening up more boundary and deep passing options for Wilson. Britain Covey delivered again with three catches for 55 yards and a pair of scores — one from Devontae Booker — and the Utes got Caleb Repp involved with two touchdowns of his own. Utah needs a big game out of several of the receivers to keep up with Cal this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:55:13.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
