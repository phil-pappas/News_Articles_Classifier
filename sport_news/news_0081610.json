I have had the bulbs replaced but the problem continues. The signals stop flashing before I can even complete my turn or the green arrow on the dash just lights but does not flash at all. I have taken the car to a Ford dealer and to three other mechanics. No one has been able to fix the problem. I am now thinking it may be the arm (not sure if this is the correct term) that is not functioning properly. I am bothered when other motorists do not signal and now I am the offender.\n— T.W., Chicago\nA: The arm you mentioned is called a stalk. The multifunction switch at the end of the stalk, below the steering column cover, could possibly be the culprit. However, the most common failure for this switch is a broken canceling tang, which causes the signals to keep flashing. The fact that they flash but quit makes us think the problem could be the turn signal flasher. It is located on the back of the fuse panel (cube shaped and probably blue). It can be a bit tricky to replace.\nQ: To be clear, when you suggest using naphtha , are you referring to naphtha paint stripper/thinner ?\n— M.S., Northampton, Pa .\nA: We are not suggesting you pour naphtha into your gas tank. Yes, naphtha is the same stuff that is used as a thinner and cleaner. It had also been used as the main ingredient in nail polish remover, but not so much anymore as it is a suspected carcinogen. Incidentally, naphtha will erase ballpoint pen ink, so use a gel pen or fountain pen when you write checks.\nQ: My daughter is thinking about buying a 2015 Toyota Avalon. The dealership is going to give her a good price but told her the car has 5,000 miles on it and was only driven by one of their executives. What should we be aware of and do you think they are telling the truth?\nEthanol in newer cars is unlikely to harm hoses, gaskets Bob Weber Q: I am using Star Tron Enzyme Fuel Treatment in my Honda lawn mower and my 2014 Honda CR-V, which was recommended by a landscaper for neutralizing the harmful effects of ethanol on rubber hoses.

If so, the dealer may be mendacious. On the other hand, it could be a good deal — a cream puff. We have previously bought two \"program cars\" and they worked out very well.\nQ: I sold my wife's 1999 Maxima to my granddaughter but she is unable to fill the gas tank. I am told that there is a pressure valve in the tank or the filler tube that kicks in. She went to a Nissan dealer who told her that it would cost $1,000 to repair but he would not guarantee it. What say you?\n— J.P., Half Day, Ill.\nA: There is a vent tube that directs fuel vapors to a charcoal canister to prevent air pollution. The canister stores them until the engine is started. Then the vapors get sucked into the engine and burned. If the tube or canister is clogged, back-pressure in the gas tank filler neck will trip the dispenser nozzle. This is a rather common problem that could be relatively cheap (replace vent line) or expensive (replace the charcoal canister and associated valves).
