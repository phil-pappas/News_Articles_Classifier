Trailing by one with just second left, Lake Forest lined up for a game-winning field goal. The attempt was blocked by Delmar, but picked up by Lake Forest’s Austin Aguilar who ran it into the end-zone for a game-winning score. The only thing separating the two teams in the opening half was a blocked point-after-attempt, and Lake Forest led 7-6 at the break. Delmar received a score from DeJour Brown, while Ben Moore scored in the first half for the Spartans. Delmar took the lead in the third quarter when Isaac Austin broke free for a long touchdown run to give them a 14-7 lead over Lake Forest. The Spartans responded with a Trevon Milton rushing touchdown, though Lake’s two-point attempt was snuffed out by Delmar setting the stage for the late-game theatrics that led to the Spartans’ victory. Lake Forest sits with a winning record at 3-2, but could easily be 5-0 or even 0-5, as all of the Spartans contest this season have been decided by a score or less. Lake Forest looks to improve to 4-2 on the year next week when they host Laurel Friday night at 7:30 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:20:41.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
