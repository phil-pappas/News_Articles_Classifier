Needing a touchdown and a two-point conversion to force overtime, the Wildcats got the ball back with just 8.8 seconds on the clock and used all but 1.1 of those seconds to move the ball to midfield on a pass from quarterback Izak Baker to Parker Lively. And then instead of throwing a Hail Mary pass, Baker took off with the football and ran for his life. He made it to the 19-yard line before getting tackled by Centralia's Deven Toennies — who grabbed Baker's facemask in the process. As expected, a yellow flag went flying. And although the scoreboard horn had sounded, a defensive penalty with time expired means an extra untimed offensive play. A dream scenario, with the ball at the 14-yard line, and an unexpected extra chance to extend the game. Except that Baker's pass to the left side of the end zone wasn't anywhere near a wide open Seth Bayer and Centralia celebrated a 28-20 victory over the Wildcats. The Orphans are now 6-1 overall and are assured a playoff game with the victory. They're also 3-1 in the South Seven Conference, having lost to Belleville Althoff which also celebrated in Marion the previous week. Marion fell to 4-3 and 2-2 and has lost two straight after winning four in a row. \"We got a really quality win tonight,\" said Centralia coach Ray Kauling. \"I think Marion has a really good football team. They're coached extremely well.\" Marion coach Kerry Martin was in no mood to talk after the game but did anyway, choosing his words carefully while obviously infuriated by his team's performance. It might have been because Centralia scored on its opening drive, capped by a short run from sophomore sensation quarterback Javon Williams, and then took a 14-0 lead on a short run by Keshawn Marshall after Marion's Lucas Shevlin had his punt blocked. It might have been because Marion couldn't get anything going offensively and only got on the board when Hunter Milligan picked up a punt that Centralia gave up on and ran it down the right sideline for an 80-yard touchdown. Marion tied the game after exchanging fumbles — Eli Barber recovered two on the night for the Wildcats — and getting yet another big play from sophomore Jaden Lacy. The speedster caught a short pass and turned it into a 57-yard gain that set up Tommy Wilson for a 1-yard touchdown. But then Centralia marched on a long drive and scored with Williams taking in another short run with 27.4 seconds left for a 21-14 lead. Page 2 of 3 - The Wildcats made the most of those final seconds and Lacy caught a heave from Baker for a 23-yard touchdown as time expired, but Mitchell Wilkie's extra-point kick sailed wide right and Centralia enjoyed a 21-20 lead at the homecoming halftime. And little did anyone figure that the Wildcats wouldn't score again. \"We got beat in every phase of the game,\" Martin said. \"How we were still in the game, I don't know. We got beat in special teams, we got beat on offense, we got beat on defense. We were very lucky.\" In the third quarter, Marion had the ball at the goal line but Baker threw incomplete on a fourth-and-2 play from the 3-yard line. Then in the fourth period, Marion failed to take advantage of Barber's second recovery as the Wildcats were backed into a fourth-and-21 and punted to the 8-yard line. Centralia got out of the hole quickly with a pass from Williams to Toennies over the middle for 30 yards, then quickly moved to the other side of the field before Marion's defense stiffened. After big plays from Ben McLaughlin and Aaron Porter, the Wildcats had the Orphans in a fourth-and-5 spot with 4:03 left in the game. An encroachment penalty gave Centralia just inches to make a first down, but the Orphans also had a penalty to move the ball back where it was. And on the fourth-down play, Williams lobbed a pass over the middle to Toennies for a 36-yard gain. Toennies was stopped near the goal line and Williams scooted in for his third touchdown with 3:30 left. Boston Closter's extra-point kick meant the Wildcats had to score and get a conversion to tie the game and Marion seemed on the way when Braden Ziegler returned the ensuing kickoff to midfield — although an illegal block penalty, which Martin argued against, moved the ball back to the 18. A long pass from Baker to Bayer got those yards back in a blink and Baker had two productive runs, but then the drive stalled. Baker threw incomplete and was sacked to bring up fourth-and 4 and Baker tried to scramble but was forced out of bounds for a turnover on downs. Centralia got the ball with 1:54 left and tried to run out of the clock but Marion was able to force a punt with 19.3 seconds remaining. But even with an extra free play, the Wildcats couldn't score and lost for the third time this season at Wildcat Stadium. \"Our kids battled all night long,\" Kauling said. \"I thought our kids had some adversity throughout the game and did a great job of coming back and fighting and winning the ballgame.\" Marion's most explosive offensive threat, Ziegler, was limited to less than 50 yards and even lost a fumble. Kauling said the game plan wasn't to focus on Ziegler but to \"slow down the overall tempo of the game\" and the Orphans did just that. Page 3 of 3 - Although Martin might argue the Wildcats did it to themselves, even if he struggled to figure out why. \"We seemed a step slow,\" Martin said. \"We seemed somewhere else. The mistakes we made — and there were a lot of them — made it a difficult game to watch. We were fortunate to still be in it at the final play of the game. I don't know how.\" Earlier in the week, Martin said he didn't think the homecoming and Senior Night festivities would be a distraction. And he repeated Friday night that those things should have served as major motivators for a strong performance. \"We had a really good week of practice,\" he said. \"There was no indication that we were going to come out and play this poorly.\" Marion's remaining games are on the road, starting next Friday at Carbondale and then traveling to Springfield in the final week of the regular season to face Rich South, which comes from Chicago and meets the Wildcats halfway. Both teams have a combined one win this season.
