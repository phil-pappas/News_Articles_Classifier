Two years ago, the race was canceled because of the federal government shutdown.\nFor many reasons, the Jersey Shore Half-Marathon was called \"a great tradition\" and \"a great race.\"\nFirst run in January 1972, the event was one of New Jersey's longest-running success stories. It preceded Frank Shorter's historic victory in the Munich Olympic Marathon. It preceded the coming of Steve Prefontaine. It helped set the stage for the coming of the second American — and worldwide — \"running boom.\"\nOriginally named the Jersey Shore Marathon (run over the full 26.2-mile distance), the race evolved into the JSHM years later but retains all its old virtues.\nForty-three editions later, however, it's again run into a situation beyond its control.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:07:28.556+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
