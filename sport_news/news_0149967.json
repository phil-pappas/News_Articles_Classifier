That streak ended with two straight draws, but it doesn’t take away from BVB’s impressive resurgence under 42-year-old new manager Thomas Tuchel. Tuchel studied under Pep Guardiola during his own sabbatical after resigning from Mainz in 2014, and on Sunday, they go head-to-head in their first Klassiker . Tuchel based his style of play at Dortmund on the same system Guardiola has used since his days at Barcelona . The results so far have been impressive for both Dortmund and Bayern in the Bundesliga. Their game model of positional play (translated from the Spanish juego de posición) makes them unique in a league dominated by pressing and counterattacking teams. Positional play focuses on generating numerical superiority through set patterns of movement, proper spacing and connections among attackers and an emphasis on ball retention and circulation. It’s a broad way of describing a choreographed system of play that every coach tweaks to his needs.
