Sports Bog, participated in the Nationals' \"Swing for Your Seats\" promotion, which gave fans the opportunity to win their season seats for free by hitting a home run. (Ashleigh Joplin and Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) \nMore than 1,400 fans flocked to Nationals Park over the weekend, many of them with hopes of hitting a home run to win free season tickets for 2016 in the team’s “Swing for Your Seats” promotion . \nOthers, such as Amber Owens, were just happy to be there. \n“To be able to swing on an MLB field is just awesome,” Owens said. \nHer strategy? \n“Smile when I swing, because that’s about the only thing I can guarantee,” she said. #Nats Season Plan Holders are trying their luck at free 2016 season seats today. #SwingForYourSeats pic.twitter.com/qXi00IuVc9 \n— Washington Nationals (@Nationals) October 10, 2015 \nGiven how stacked the odds were against everyone who stepped to the plate, including Clinton Yates and me, Owens’s strategy was probably the best approach. \nOne person per season ticket account, or a proxy, was eligible to participate in the event and bring one guest. The pitching machine on the mound was firing baseballs at what seemed like 40 mph, meaning most of the force required to hit the ball out of the park would need to be supplied by the batter and team-supplied wooden bats. Finally, participants could see up to two pitches and take up to one swing. So much for getting comfortable in the box. \nNot surprisingly, no one hit a home run, but a Nationals spokesperson said two fans got to spin a prize wheel after hitting one of the four mannequins set up in the outfield. Consider Tyler Moore. (Scott Allen/The Washington Post) \n“My goal was just to hit a fair ball somewhere, to tell you the truth,” said Tom LaBue, who won a Jayson Werth autographed baseball on Saturday. “I hit a line drive that probably the second baseman would’ve caught, but it rolled out and hit the mannequin in right-center.” The prize wheel. (Scott Allen/The Washington Post) \nThe Nationals gave fans access to the team’s indoor batting cages, where they could take a few hacks against live pitching before stepping onto the field. Fans could also test their arms against a radar gun in the bullpen and tour the visitors’ clubhouse. A fan takes a cut in the indoor batting cage. (Scott Allen/The Washington Post) \n“It was cool,” said 17-year-old Teddy McDonald, whose goal was to hit the ball as far as he could, but pounded the first pitch he saw into the ground. “I’ve gone to baseball games all my life, but now I’ve taken a pitch on the field.” \nMarni Brown was serving as the proxy for her mother, who was in Greece. A fast-pitch pitcher through high school who still plays in co-ed softball leagues, Brown decided she would take the first pitch and swing at the second. \n“I got up there, I felt ready, I watched the first one come in, it’s nice and slow,” Brown said. “I saw the second pitch come in and popped it straight up. I didn’t channel my inner Bryce Harper. But it was awesome, really cool. Probably one of the best things I’ve done in my whole life.” While there were no home runs, we had a great time hosting our Season Plan Holders at #SwingForYourSeats last wknd. pic.twitter.com/yOmcD2n0lm \n— Washington Nationals (@Nationals) October 12, 2015 Scott Allen writes about all things D.C. sports.
