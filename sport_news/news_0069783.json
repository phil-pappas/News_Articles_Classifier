The 2-2 score lasted just over 10 minutes before the Lobos secured the game-winner. \nSvantesson increased his team-leading goal total to six on the year, and also dished out the assist on Ruiz's score. Svantesson has now scored in two-straight matches and three times in the last four outings. \nRuiz punched in his fifth goal of the year after finding the net in his third-straight match. He also moved up to a tie for fourth in the UAB record book in career goals, now with 29. The Lobos finished with 20 shots with five on target, while UAB put three of its seven attempts on goal. \nThe Blazers return to action Saturday night at West Campus Field versus Florida Atlantic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T05:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:34:38.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
