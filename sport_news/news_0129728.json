Nearly a week into his tenure with the Brewers, new general manager David Stearns is beginning to set a fresh tone for a franchise in transition. (AP Photo/Morry Gash, File) \nMILWAUKEE (AP) — New Brewers general manager David Stearns has made his first significant addition to the front office with the hiring of Matt Arnold as vice president and assistant general manager. \nArnold joins Milwaukee following about nine years with the Tampa Rays organization. The 36-year-old Arnold most recently served as Tampa’s director of player personnel. \nStearns says Arnold has been involved in nearly every area of baseball operations during his career, including contract negotiation and farm system evaluation. Arnold’s resume also includes stops with the worked the Dodgers, Rangers and Reds. \nThe addition of Arnold is the latest step in an organization-wide youth movement following Milwaukee’s first 90-loss season since 2004.
