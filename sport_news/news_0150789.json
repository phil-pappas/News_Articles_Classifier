Solo claimed to be the victim in the incident but after an investigation, Kirkland, Wash., prosecutors charged her with two counts of fourth-degree assault.\nIn January, Kirkland Municipal Court Judge Michael Lambo dismissed the charges on procedural grounds after prosecution witnesses refused multiple requests to be interviewed. But in an unusual move prosecutors challenged that decision and an appeals court reinstated the charges without comment.\nNo trial date has been set for the case.\n“We are shocked and disappointed by the judge's ruling,” Solo’s attorney Todd Maybrown said in a statement. “However, we maintain our position that the charges in this case should have never been filed, that the original trial court's dismissal of the case was correct, and we plan to file an appeal of today's decision with the court of appeals.”\nBoth Solo and U.S. Soccer declined to comment Friday.\nU.S. Soccer suspended Solo for a month last winter following an incident in which her husband, former NFL player Jerramy Stevens, was arrested on a DUI charge while behind the wheel of a team van. At the time U.S. Soccer Federation President Sunil Gulati said Solo’s behavior had left her place on the World Cup team in doubt.\nBut she was reinstated in February and went on to be chosen as the World Cup’s top goalkeeper, allowing just three goals in seven games while helping the U.S. to its first world championship in 16 years.\nFriday’s court decision leaves her availability for next summer’s Olympic Games uncertain.\nNEWSLETTER: Get the day's top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj >>\nSolo, 34, holds U.S. national team records for wins and shutouts.\nShe last played Thursday for the Seattle Reign in the National Women’s Soccer League title game, allowing a goal to World Cup teammate Amy Rodriguez in a game the FC Kansas City won, 1-0.\nFollow me on Twitter: @kbaxter11\nMORE FROM SPORTS\nAdrien Broner shuts his mouth to say all the right things\nEast L.A.'s Julian Ramirez bringing more fight to StubHub Center\nRain or shine, college and NFL games still on despite Hurricane Joaquin\nPrivacy Policy Trials and Arbitration Soccer Hope Solo Jerramy Stevens Amy Rodriguez", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-boxing-julian-ramirez-lucas-matthysse-postol-20151002-story.html#navtype=blogroll", "http://www.latimes.com/newsletters/la-newsletter-todays-headlines-signup-page-htmlstory.html", "http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-college-nfl-games-to-go-despite-hurricane-joaquin-20151002-story.html#navtype=blogroll", "http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-sn-adrien-broner-boxing-showtime-20151002-story.html#navtype=blogroll", "https://twitter.com/kbaxter11", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ef9c8/turbine/la-sp-sn-hope-solo-faces-domestic-violence-case-20151002"], "published": "2015-10-03T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T19:58:16.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
