I stopped that in July when a PET scan showed the chemotherapy drug was not working and the cancer was progressing.\" \nUrich now sees an oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. She orally takes a scorpion venom extract that is supposed to target and kill cancer cells. It costs about $700 per bottle. \n\"I'm trying to fight this through non-traditional means,\" said Urich, whose youngest son Cole, 14, is a defensive back for Pennridge's freshman squad. \"I think it's my only option at this point.\" \nUrich, who became a grandmother in April, is also aided by her husband Butch, eldest son Jake, 22, and Jake's girlfriend, Shannon. Her sister, Terry, retired from her full-time job and moved with her two daughters to the Urich's home to be Kathy's full-time caretaker. \nLast month, Pennridge's football booster club organized a dodgeball tournament at NexGen High Performance Training Center in Telford that raised about $7,000 to help Urich's fight against cancer. T-shirts are being sold in school and at games. \n\"It's been a difficult time, but so many people have been supportive and encouraging,\" said Dean Urich, who plans to study exercise physiology in college. \nKathy and Dean Urich were honorary captains for a nonleague contest vs. Central Bucks West on Sept. 18. Dean made a third-quarter interception to help clinch a 34-0 triumph at Helman Field. \n\"Dean has always been kind of an underdog,\" said Kathy Urich, who was wheeled out to midfield by Dean for the coin toss. \"It was amazing to watch him make that play. It was like the stars aligned.\" \nFor those wanting to donate, checks can be made payable to \"The Benefit of Kathy Urich\" and mailed to Urich's home at 108 Ridge Run Road, Sellersville, Pa. 18960.
