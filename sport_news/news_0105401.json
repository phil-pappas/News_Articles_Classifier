It provides accountability,” Zevotek said. “When one brother is having a bad day, I know I can lean on the other to pick them up. That’s something coaches covet.” \nThere’s junior Kurt Naumann and his brother, Erik, a freshman. Erik worked hard to transition up to varsity this summer — the Naumanns trained with the Affolders in order to best prepare the underclassman. \nZevotek pointed to a team hike in the preseason that affirmed Erik’s transformation from modified to varsity runner. All the while, he observed Kurt, already fixed in the varsity program, grow tenfold alongside his brother. \n“When I saw what (the Naumanns) could do in speed drills, I could see our top runners were all going to finish in a big clump,” Zevotek said. “I’m proud to see the results.” \nZevotek said the Naumanns have helped fill the roles left behind by last year’s seniors, Nick Anderson and Brandon McCreery. \nIdentical twins James and Justin Runge, both juniors, have raised the floor for this Comets team. The Runges are stars in the track and field program, where they excel in the hurdles competitions. “They’re a lot of fun,” Zevotek said. “They run track, and so I say they’re extending (themselves) to be cross country runners. They run 800 meters or shorter, so to extend to three miles is asking a lot.” \nZevotek said each twin runs the 800 hurdles in about two minutes — for perspective, the Affolders run it in a little under two minutes. James is finally recovered from a bone growth inside his hip socket, which required surgery and forced him to miss last spring’s season. Zevotek wants to try James out at pole vaulting next season. Meanwhile, Justin runs the 400 hurdles in record time. \nAnother pair of siblings making noise in the program are junior Brian and his seventh grade sister Taylor Lamonica. Taylor placed ninth in just her second meet at the varsity level. \nTaylor has been suffering from shin splints since being called up at the end of September, just ahead of the midseason deadline. After placing third in the EJ Herrmann Invitational at the modified level, she told Zevotek she wanted to run with the varsity, and the family and coach decided she was ready. \n“Where she finished today, gee, she could be very good,” he said. \nHer older brother Brian is a fixture on the varsity, but Zevotek has been floored by his improvement. Lamonica and South Lewis standout Dylan Durgan are friendly rivals, and Zevotek has lauded Durgan’s accomplishments, often using him as a comparison for Lamonica to measure himself against. \nFor the second time this season, Lamonica finished ahead of Durgan. \n“The first time, I thought it was a fluke,” Zevotek said. “Today he passed Durgan with about 250 meters to go and never looked back. Today was a big leap forward for Brian.” \nLowville’s Sammon wins No. 400 \nIn the midst of one of Lowville girls soccer’s greatest seasons, longtime head coach Leo Sammon has accomplished something special, winning his 400th game in a 6-0 victory over General Brown. \nSammon led Lowville to a Class B sectional title in 2011, and before that, a Class C sectional title in 1997. Over 28 seasons, the Red Raiders have won 18 “B” Division titles under Sammon. \n“There’s a sense of accomplishment, of consistency,” Sammon said. “Hard work for quite a few years from the kids and the coaches. I’m lucky we’ve had kids who play so hard and a community that supports us.” \nSammon helped produce a pair of Division 1 players, Chelsea Berry and Taylor Haenlin, who both excelled at Syracuse University. The always affable Sammon said the toughest losses standout as much as his biggest wins. He remembered losing in sectionals to IHC and Marcellus in 2009 and 2010, respectively, before school enrollment dropped and Lowville reclassified to Class C. \nThen there’s the near defeats turned to program-defining wins. In 2009, Lowville found itself down 3-0 to Solvay in the sectional semifinals. The Red Raiders charged back with four unanswered goals to claim victory. \n“The win stands out because that was a group of kids that wasn’t going to be denied,” Sammon said. Sammon was able to coach his three daughters over the last decade — his two youngest daughters were on the 2011 title team. \n“400 (wins) is about my family being involved,” Sammon said. “I think about my daughters playing. I think about (assistant coach) Chris Bach playing for me and then coaching for 17-18 years. Her daughter (Alexis Bach) plays for us now. It’s been our families’ lives.” \nLowville (15-0-1, 13-0-1) has the best overall record in the Frontier League this year.
