Posted: Friday, October 9, 2015 12:00 am Moving the Chains: Confidence a key component in high school kicking game Moving the Chains Matt Jenkins Salem News \nThe two biggest story lines from the National Football League last week were the batted ball out of the back of the end zone by Seattle Seahawks linebacker K.J. Wright and the general ineptitude of all kickers. \nThe non-call on Wright’s decision to poke the ball out of the end zone cost one team -- the Detroit Lions -- a chance to win in the final moments. Kickers from across the league, on the other hand, cost multiple teams chances to win games. \nFrom now ex-Pittsburgh Steelers kicker Josh Scobee, who missed a pair of fourth-quarter field goals against the Baltimore Ravens in an overtime loss, to Jacksonville Jaguars’ kicker Jason Myers, who failed to convert what would have been game-winning field goals in both regulation and overtime in a loss to the Indianapolis Colts, it was just a rough few days for kicking specialists. \nKicking, whether it be field goals or extra points, has become viewed as automatic when it comes to professional football, which is why the 18 missed kicks last weekend made it seem like we were reaching football Armageddon. \nBlasting a ball through the uprights is far less automatic at the high school level, but it is still part of the game that is often taken for granted or under-appreciated. \nRarely are high school kickers scrutinized for missing a late, game-winning field goal, but that’s due in large part to the fact that most teams never even take the chance of kicking a game-winning field goal. Still, coaches know a time may come this season when they have a decision to make: send the offense out to convert a big fourth-down play or a last-second score, or send out the kicking team. \nThe confidence a coach has in his kicker can make or break that decision. \n“When you play so many good teams, it’s only a matter of time before you get bogged down in the red zone,” said St. John’s Prep coach Brian St. Pierre, whose kicker Pat McTiernan is one of the area’s best. “His range is probably anywhere near the mid 30s. Around the 15-yard line maybe if we’re facing a 4th-and-10 I wouldn’t hesitate to do it. We thought about kicking the other night (against Malden Catholic), but (the decision not to) wasn’t anything in lack of confidence in Patrick. We thought something else might work.” \nOf course, field goals at the high school level are few and far between. It’s really the extra points that can be so critical in determining the outcome of games. \nMarblehead coach Jim Rudloff was happy to have Garret Keough returning as his kicker this fall. Keough, now a senior, won the kicking job as a sophomore and the team enjoyed great success kicking last fall. \nThis year, it’s been more of a struggle, and it has very little to do with Keough. \nThe whole kicking process is often overlooked. It takes an accurate snap, solid blocking, and good placement before the kick is even attempted. \n“Last year I think Garret was the top guy in the state because we scored so much and he made every single attempt except one,” Rudloff said. “If I remember correctly, we lost the (2009) Super Bowl by an extra point and two years later we didn’t go because of an extra-point loss to Wakefield. We’ve had a lot of games where we’ve been on the wrong end of an extra point. It means everything, especially if you’re having a tough time putting points on the board. More than anything else, it’s one of the most misunderstood or most under-appreciated parts of the game.” \nUnlike higher levels of football, where kickers are recruited or signed, coaches are mostly dealing with athletes. If there’s a player with a soccer background or a knack for kicking the football, then they inherit the job. \nMany times those players are needed in other areas, like Keough who is the starting quarterback for the Magicians. Spending time practicing kicking isn’t the highest of priorities for high school football teams. \n“Mostly every day we have a little time before practice when the snappers work together with the punters and holders and kickers. About twice a week we do it as a team, as a unit. That’s usually about it,” Keough said. “I played soccer before I played football and I started kicking off in the sixth grade in youth football. I started kicking extra points my sophomore year. We had open tryouts and I won the job then.” \nSome coaches would rather take a chance for two points after a touchdown. \nRudloff recalls Matt Durgin always going for two when he was coaching at Lynn Classical because he wanted to spend his practice time wisely. It’s a method Durgin still uses at St. Mary’s now. \n“He always went for two because he thought it was more important to use the practice time on something else. Different coaches approach it different ways. For Steve Dembowski it was part of his offense with the muddle huddle,” Rudloff said. “I think in my first seven years we tried a field goal once. We wanted to make sure to get three points and get ahead. It’s funny because we missed every extra point that night. That was the one good snap and good hold we got all night.” \nHaving a kicking game that a coach has confidence in is such a luxury at the high school level. \n“It feels great. You almost take it for granted that you’re getting seven and not six, but we spend a lot of time on it,” St. Pierre said. “Patrick does the kicking and punting. He’s not a positional player. We’re always looking for a kid who kicked or punted in the past or a soccer player that might get cut. Patrick won a competition with a couple other guys and he’s done a pretty good job.” \n¢¢¢ \nIt seems every season at least one player in the area achieves the scoring cycle, with points scored via touchdown, extra point, two-point conversion, and field goal. Garret Keough of Marblehead is the early favorite this season. \nKeough, the Magicians’ quarterback, has scored one touchdown, kicked six extra points and has a field goal, which is typically the most difficult category to fill. Keough just needs the two-pointer to become the first player in the area to record the cycle. He might even get bonus points for throwing for a touchdown, too. \nOf course, Keough becoming the first player to fill the scoring columns isn’t a slam dunk. Watch out for Beverly’s Matt Madden, who has seven touchdowns and 12 extra points this year. He also missed a field goal attempt this fall, a 25-yarder that slipped outside the upright against Peabody. \n¢¢¢ \nPingree is looking to build a little momentum after dropping two of its first three games this season. Holderness is the next team in line for the Highlanders and historically it’s been a mixed bag for Pingree against this opponent. \nIn nine meetings, Holderness holds a 5-4 advantage after winning last year’s contest, 42-41. \nPingree has been able to score points against Holderness in the past. The Highlanders have posted an average of 39.75 points per game in their four wins over Holderness, and a 31.8 ppg overall through nine games. \nThat could bode well for a Pingree team that has already put up 101 points through three games. \nThe senior quarterback-wide receiver duo of Griffin Beal and Justin Assad heated up last weekend in a 54-40 loss to New Hampton. The pair connected on nine passes for 194 yards and three TDs. \n“It’s funny, Justin had put up good numbers but hadn’t exploded,” Pingree coach Chris Powers said. “In this game he had some nice catches and he was running great after the catch. They were in sync all game.” \nPingree’s defense will have to rise to the occasion against Holderness if the Highlanders are going to get back to .500. \n“They’re a spread passing team with a post-graduate quarterback that’s pretty talented from what we’ve heard,” Powers said. “After the game (Saturday) we were looking at film and they’re pretty talented. It wouldn’t shock me if we had another high scoring affair. Hopefully we can get some defensive stops mixed in and hopefully it’s another exciting game. \n“All the games in our league are a battle, so this one shouldn’t be any different.” \n¢¢¢ \nBishop Fenwick football coach Dave Woods applauded assistant coach Dave Dugan for his defensive game plan for Archbishop Williams last week. After spending a week of practice switching from a 4-3 to a 4-4 defense for the Bishops, Woods joked that his defensive coordinator didn’t get much sleep. \nBased on the makeup of the Catholic Central League this year, Dugan may be a very tired individual by the time November wraps up. \nFenwick knocked Williams from the unbeaten ranks with a 22-0 victory Friday night and the team’s reward was a hard week of practice to get ready for 3-1 Austin Prep. \nThe Cougars are coming off a 38-0 loss to Cardinal Spellman, but that’s their only blemish so far and Woods expects Austin Prep to be ready for Friday night. \n“Coach (Bill) Maradei has been to every one of our games and I don’t care what anybody says, coach Maradei is the best coach in the state,” said Woods, whose team moved to 4-0 with the win over Williams. “We’re going to have our work cut out for us I’m sure. They’re going to be big and physical and they come right at you. And they can throw the ball. It’s back to the drawing board.” \n¢¢¢ \nMoving the Chains, a column on North Shore high school football, appears Friday’s in The Salem News during the fall sports season.
