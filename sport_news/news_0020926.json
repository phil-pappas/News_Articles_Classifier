We're playing against a well balanced side that always likes to mix things up when it comes to physicality. \n\"They have a good set-piece and some strong ball carriers up front and in the back - it's what you expect to face at this stage of the competition and we're very excited about the challenge.\" \nSaturday's opening World Cup quarter-final against Wales will be the 42nd time Pietersen and Habana have occupied the wings in South Africa's starting XV. \nHabana tops the England 2015 try-scoring chart with five, while Pietersen is joint second with four - a position he shares with five other players. \n\"JP and Bryan have been in superb form and are playing some of the best rugby of their lives,\" Meyer said. \n\"It made sense to reunite Bryan and JP on the wing as it brings a lot of experience to our backline, which has been doing well despite the relative inexperience of Handre Pollard, Damian de Allende and Jesse Kriel.\" \nHabana is the joint highest try-scorer in the World Cup history with 15. One more will elevate him above New Zealand great Jonah Lomu. \nSouth Africa's starting XV against Wales contains 686 caps with a further 337 caps sat on the bench. \nSouth Africa: W le Roux; JP Pietersen, J Kriel, D de Allende, B Habana; H Pollard, F du Preez (capt); T Mtawarira, B du Plessis, F Malherbe, E Etzebeth, L de Jager, F Louw, S Burger , D Vermeulen. \nReplacements: A Strauss, T Nyakane, J du Plessis, PS du Toit, W Alberts, R Pienaar, P Lambie, J Serfontein.
