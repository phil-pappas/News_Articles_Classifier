The most important one could come up on Sunday at Talladega Superspeedway.\nThe last lap of the day probably will determine which eight drivers advance to the Chase's Eliminator round, which includes the AAA Texas 500 at Texas Motor Speedway on Nov. 8. That is how racing at Talladega works.\nRestrictor plates work against separation. That means the final lap, with spots in the Chase at stake, could turn into an all-out, slide-across-the-finish-line-on-your-roof ending. There will be twisted sheet metal in its wake.\nNASCAR recognized the possibility and changed the green-white-checkered finish rule for this race. If the field cannot finish in regulation, there will be only one green-white-checkered instead of the maximum of three at other tracks.\n\"You can be leading the race, taking the white flag and get knocked out on the last lap,\" Martin Truex Jr. said. \"It's going to be a crazy deal at the end.\"\nUsually, that means the race. This time, it means the Chase, too.\nOf the remaining 12 drivers, including Truex in the lone remaining one-car team, only Joey Logano is assured of a spot in the next round. He won the first two races in this round.\nMatt Kenseth and Dale Earnhardt Jr. are in terrible predicaments. Each probably needs a win to move into the next round, as Brad Keselowski did last season.\nThat leaves the other nine racers, stuck together in tight quarters.\nDenny Hamlin, second to Logano, leads ninth-place Kyle Busch by 18 points. A year ago, Busch started this race in second with a 26-point lead over Matt Kenseth in ninth. Busch was caught up in a nine-car wreck, routine by Talladega standards, and was eliminated with a finish of 40th.\nThis is what NASCAR hoped for when it went to the Chase: tension rising during each three-race round.\n\"There are so many things out of your control, and you want to control as many things as possible on a week-to-week basis,\" said defending Cup champion Kevin Harvick, who is tied with Keselowski for fifth. \"There are so many more things that can happen at Talladega, with the odds of getting in an accident way higher. ... Talladega is the one that you don't want to have to deal with.\"\nThere are different ways to approach this race.\nEarnhardt won the spring race by getting to the front and staying there, as he usually does in the restrictor-plate races. He led the most laps overall with 67, including the final 27.\nThat was an abnormal result. In 10 races at Talladega from 2010-14, the racer who had the most laps led did not win the race. The winner got the lead on the last lap seven times, with Kenseth doing it twice.\nThe other options are to stay more in the middle of the pack, close to the lead but also risking involvement in \"The Big One,\" that that everyone anticipates. Or a driver can watch the field from the back and try to avoid trouble until the last stage of the race. Kyle Busch tried that approach last season and had it blow up on him.\nThe lag-back strategy \"is probably the hardest one because you have to figure out when to go because you don't know if there are going to be cautions or you are going to have a green-flag stop,\" said Ryan Newman, who is 10th and winless for the season. \"You can put yourself right out of the race doing that. I think you can do it easier racing in the middle.\n\"There is a point where you want to stay out front and stay out of the mess, but you have to have a car that will give you that. If not, you have to stay out of trouble.\"\nUntil the last lap. At that point, it is every driver for himself, with the goal of continuing in the Chase.\nTwitter: @gfraley\nOn Twitter:\n @gfraley", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/gfraley"], "published": "2015-10-22T04:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:25:43.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
