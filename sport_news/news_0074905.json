I was waiting for a game like that,\" Kurtz told reporters after he led BYU in receiving yards. \"It doesn't come around too often, but when it does, it feels great. I love this team.\" \nEven more special for Kurtz was the chance to share the evening with his family. His father, who moved to Provo a year ago to be closer to Kurtz's college career, was in LaVell Edwards Stadium, and his mother made the drive from California to watch him play against the Bearcats. \"He hasn't gotten to see me score, and I'm sure he loved it,\" said Kurtz, whose uncle and brother were also in the stands. \"He said he was crying, and everyone was crying when I scored.\" \nKurtz already had one highlight-reel touchdown catch, going up in coverage to haul in an 18-yard pass in the corner of the end zone by dragging his foot inbounds to tie the game at 17-17 with 9:31 left in the third quarter. \n\"Sometimes you get nervous, but today I was laughing,\" Kurtz said about his late score, visibly enjoying the game. \"I saw the ball sailing, and I laughed; I was so wide open. \nHead coach Bronco Mendenhall didn't know how Kurtz wound up so open on the touchdown. \n\"I just saw that he was wide open,\" Mendenhall said. \"I don't know what happened … but Nick's entire family was here today. It's really fun to see a player play like that in front of his family. That makes it really special, and he did a nice job.\" \nBut players still need to make plays, and Kurtz has been tasked to do that since a year ago from Grossmont College, where he totaled 1,301 yards and 18 touchdowns. \nAfter redshirting the 2014 season with an injury, Kurtz has found himself a frequent target of freshman quarterback Tanner Mangum. The 22-year-old true freshman has found the 6-foot-5, 205-pound target 23 times for 354 yards, but Friday night came Kurtz's two trips into the end zone. \nMangum couldn't believe some of the plays Kurtz was making — including his 53-yard stroll into the end zone. \n\"I almost didn't believe my eyes; I wasn't sure he was that open,\" said Mangum, who completed 19-of-32 passes for 252 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. \"When I saw the corner came down on Devon (Blackmon) running an out route, he left Nick wide open. \n\"I just wanted to put it out there and let him go get it. It was pretty fun. \n\"In that moment, you don't think about it. You just throw it.\" \nKurtz deferred much of his success to Mangum — and also the linemen in front of the quarterback who didn't let up a sack on the night, even as the BYU defense brought down Cincinnati quarterback Hayden Moore eight times. \n\"Tanner didn't get sacked once, and Bronson (Kaufusi) was doing all the sacking,\" Kurtz said. \"This was a game where we needed to make sure Tanner didn't get hit, coming off that (hamstring) injury. It was a lot of fun for me.\" \nKaufusi finished the evening with five tackles, three sacks, a forced fumble and a blocked field goal attempt to lead a BYU defense that produced the most sacks since 1999. But the former Timpview standout credited much of his success to the return of nose tackle Travis Tuiloma, who made his full return to the lineup after an injury in the season opener against Nebraska. Tuiloma re-debuted against East Carolina in a handful of plays, but started in the middle of the defensive front Friday night. \nThe Cougars noticed the change. \n\"Because of his physicality and how he plays, he always demands a double team inside,\" Kaufusi said. \"If they don't double him, he'll push that guy right back into the quarterback. Having him there just complements the whole defense and allows the defense to do a lot more.\" Twitter responds to Cardiac Cougars' win over Cincinnati \n\"It's amazing. You can just feel the sideline ignite,\" he said. \"We were determined. I think what's happening now is that we've been in the situation enough times that there isn't doubt; there's an optimism. \n\"They just really think they're going to win. We prepare really hard mentally at a high level. I think they trust us, but I also think they trust each other, and I can't do that for them.\" \nMangum said it's part late-game conditioning and part belief. \n\"We just keep playing and believing,\" he added. \"We know that the game is never over, and we just keep fighting. We stay positive, no matter what, and we just keep helping each other because we know the fourth quarter is the time to come through and finish the game.\" \nPerhaps Algie Brown, who led 88 yards and two touchdowns on the ground, said it best.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:30:34.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
