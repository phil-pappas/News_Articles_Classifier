Referring to vehicles and bikes, he said, \"Hold a can of soup in one hand, and a raw egg in the other. Smack them together and my point is made.\" \nSo Saturday, The MinusCar Project bike advocacy group hosted a canned food drive on Dakota Avenue between 10th and 11th street this morning. About 50 bikers donated items. \nThese bikers say they should be able to share the road safely with drivers. But the event also aimed to raise food for those in need. Group members collected more than 300 cans total. \nThey plan to donate the goods to Feeding South Dakota. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
