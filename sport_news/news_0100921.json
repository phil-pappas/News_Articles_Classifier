(AP File Photo/Kathy Willens) \nMATZ ON THE MEND: Steven Matz’s back is feeling “better” according to manager Terry Collins, and the hope is to have the left-hander pitch in relief against the Nationals either Saturday or Sunday. \n“The medication he got [Wednesday] has made a big difference,” Collins said. \nCollins said he wants Matz’s outing to be of a starter’s length, which would mean he will piggyback the final innings in his outing. \nCollins believes it’s important for Matz to pitch in a real game before the playoffs rather than just throw in the instructional league. \n“He needs to get some adrenaline going,” Collins said. “For me, that’s the only way you’re going to get the rhythm and release points and stuff you need, when there’s a little excitement in the air.” \nCollins added that Matz can’t just be inserted into the playoff rotation without pitching prior to it, and said how Matz fares in his outing could affect the team’s plans. \n“The biggest thing is how he comes out of that game. We’re looking at a guy, last couple of times he’s come out there’s been an issue,” Collins said. “I want to make sure if he goes out and starts he’s going to be OK because if something happens … we don’t have him in the second round.” \nFEELING FINE: Yoenis Cespedes (hand) told Collins after Wednesday’s game he could start the series finale, but the outfielder received the day off after being hit in the hand with a pitch. Collins is not sure if Cespedes will be available tonight. \nFLORES UPDATE: Wilmer Flores (back) received treatment Thursday but said he felt the same as he did after experiencing back spasms Wednesday. He said he can play this weekend. \n“It’s not that big of a deal,” Flores said. \nUNSURE URIBE: Juan Uribe (chest) has shown very little improvement and went to see a doctor in New York on Wednesday. Uribe could be a key piece against the Dodgers lefty starters. \nBRIEFS: Collins said the team is considering flipping Tyler Clippard and Addison Reed depending on the matchups in the seventh and eighth innings. … Eric O’Flaherty was not available Thursday after his back flared up but the lefty reliever said he was fine. \n© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:42:35.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
