The Cardinals and Cubs have played 2,363 games against each other over the years, but this is the first time in the history of the rivalry that they have met in postseason play. St. Louis Mayor Rejects Emanuel's Cubs Bet While the Cubs are relying on a group of players that has very little postseason experience (with the exception of David Ross and Jon Lester, who will serve as the battery in Game 1 of the series Friday), the Cardinals have a ton of experience all over their lineup. Yadier Molina, who tore a ligament in his thumb during a game against the Cubs in September, will return to the Cardinals for Friday’s game, batting seventh and catching. The Cardinals will also have Matt Holliday batting third and playing in left field for the game, and when you add Matt Carpenter and John Lackey into the mix, they have a definite experience advantage over the Cubs in this contest. Colbert Decries Billy Goat Curse, Predicts Cubs World Series Win The Cardinals could also have an advantage in terms of Lackey’s career performance against some of the Cubs’ top hitters. Anthony Rizzo has just one hit in 12 plate appearances with two strikeouts against Lackey in his career, and Dexter Fowler is 2-for-7 lifetime against the Cardinals starter. The Cubs do have one bright spot in the order in that regard, with Chris Coghlan going 8-for-17 lifetime against Lackey, but other than that it’s been tough sledding. Despite those struggles, the Cubs do come into the game with the confidence of already beating a pitcher in this postseason that they’ve had trouble with in the past. Gerrit Cole was 7-1 against the Cubs in his career before Wednesday’s wild card game, and all the Cubs did was take a lead against him before he could even record an out.
