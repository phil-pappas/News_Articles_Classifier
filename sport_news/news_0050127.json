But the way he was working - in six to eight weeks of struggle that was boring and not ideal and not fun - he did it as a great professional and now we are expecting big benefits out of that. \n\"Those stories are definite, there is something behind them, they are true. It is very rare that people are making up stories. \n\"There is something there, but it looks much worse. I don't want to comment on the stories. \n\"He's been out a few times, but his rehabilitation and training, especially in that period, was top class.\" \nBilic made Carroll undergo his own mini pre-season, rather than rush him back into the team, in a bid to avoid the frontman breaking down again. \n\"We tried to explain to him that he needed to work for six weeks and have a pre-season, not to train for 10 days, roll up his sleeves and play the game,\" he added. \n\"He did his time and we should all benefit from that.\" \nCarroll has shaken off the knock which kept him out of the 2-2 draw at Sunderland a fortnight ago and is fit to face Crystal Palace on Saturday. \nHe could be joined in the squad by fellow forward Enner Valencia, who was injured during the Europa League tie against Astra Giurgiu in July, and defender Angelo Ogbonna following a hamstring injury.
