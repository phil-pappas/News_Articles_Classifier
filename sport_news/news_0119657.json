CBS 13 Sacramento video image 1 of 2 \nmglover@sacbee.com \nThe man killed in a Thursday afternoon shootout involving Sacramento County sheriff’s deputies in Carmichael has been identified as Adrienne Jamarr Ludd, 36, of Sacramento. \nLudd had an extensive rap sheet dating back some 20 years, sheriff’s officials said Friday in a news release. \nOfficials also said the handgun Ludd brandished jammed during the deadly confrontation with three deputies. \nThe Sheriff’s Department said the three deputies involved in the shooting are 12-year, 14-year and 20-year veterans of the department. In accordance with department procedure, the deputies will be placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation. They’re currently assigned to field and investigative services. \nSheriff’s officials said the incident began about noon Thursday when a deputy tried to stop a vehicle with expired registration near Manzanita Avenue and Winding Way. The deputy observed two men inside the vehicle. \nOfficials said the deputy tried to pull over the vehicle, which sped up and pulled away. The deputy reported seeing one of the vehicle occupants “grabbing something from the back seat” during the pursuit. \nOfficials said Ludd failed to stop at several stop signs through residential areas, and other deputies responded to assist. They said Ludd finally yielded, and his passenger immediately exited the car with his hands in the air. As the deputy was making contact with the passenger, officials said Ludd fled the scene in the car. \nThe fleeing vehicle stopped in the middle of Cypress Avenue west of Garfield Avenue. Officials said Ludd exited the vehicle armed with a handgun and took cover behind his car. Sheriff’s officials said Ludd took a shooting stance and leveled his gun at officers, and officers fired “several rounds” at Ludd. \nIn Friday’s news release, officials said Ludd was armed with “a loaded Tec-22 handgun with a high-capacity magazine,” and that “further investigation has shown the suspect’s weapon was not functional because of a jam.” \nDuring the shooting, sheriff’s officials said, Ludd “lost control of his weapon as he went to the ground. Officers ceased shooting and reassessed the situation. Officers then observed the suspect attempting to retrieve the handgun and re-engaged the suspect fearing for their safety and the safety of others.” \nOfficials said deputies subdued Ludd and then began administering life-saving measures, but Ludd was pronounced dead at the scene by Sacramento Metro Fire officials. \nA loaded .25-caliber pistol was found in one of Ludd’s pants pockets, officials said. The man who surrendered to deputies has not been identified.  ;", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:40:35.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
