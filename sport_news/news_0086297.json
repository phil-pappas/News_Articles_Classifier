He told them the team was in the same position eight years ago, looked too far ahead and got burnt. \nStill, he tries not to think about that nightmare too often. \n“I find that’s the best way to approach it,” he told AAP. \n“We’ve got another opportunity now so that’s all that is important.” \nIt has, however, helped knock any talk of complacency on the head – whether within the team or from external sources such as the media or betting markets. \n“It’s important that you keep reinforcing that throughout the week,” Moore said. \n“There’s going to be a lot of peripheral talk about the game. \n“We need to make sure we only focus on what we know is important which is preparing really well, training hard, being honest with each other and our preparation and giving ourselves confidence before we get to the weekend.” \nAdds Giteau: “What’s a favourite tag, really? When you’re in the finals, favouritism is just for betting agencies. It’s not for us. \n“There will be no complacency. None. \n“In 2007 we had a great pool stage and I was talking about how strong we’re going. \n“Then we lose to England and we’re out. It happens that quick.” \nMoore and Giteau will both celebrate their 100th Test milestone against Scotland, joining David Campese, Stephen Larkham, George Gregan, George Smith, Nathan Sharp and Ashley-Cooper as the only Wallabies to have done so. \nBut like his captain, Giteau has a singular focus this weekend. \n“(This milestone) means nothing unless the team is able to achieve success,” Giteau told AAP. \n“I’ve had the opportunity to be fortunate enough to get some individual success while I’ve been away and team success as well. \n“I know which one feels better, and that’s team success. \n“To be able to celebrate with your teammates on something you’ve achieved together, that’s the bigger picture. That’s what I’m chasing.” \nTeams: \nAustralia: Kurtley Beale, Adam Ashley-Cooper, Tevita Kuridrani, Matt Giteau, Drew Mitchell, Bernard Foley, Will Genia, Ben McCalman, Michael Hooper, Scott Fardy, Rob Simmons, Kane Douglas, Sekope Kepu, Stephen Moore (capt), Scott Sio.
