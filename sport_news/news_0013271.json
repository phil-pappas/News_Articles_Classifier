Bolwell hit Strong on a two-point conversion to slice the Saddle Brook lead to seven, 34-27 with four minutes remaining in the game. \nThe Wildcats didn't kick the extra point because their usual kicker, James Loremikan, suffered a wrist injury in the first half that kept him out of the game. \"He (Loremikan) kept asking me if he could come out and kick the extra point, but I couldn't risk that,\" said Maher about Loremikan who had a sling wrapped around his right arm. \nBut fortunately Becton didn't need the kicking on this day. \nBecton tried an onside kick that failed and Saddle Brook recovered the ball on its 39-yard line. \"They were moving the ball very well, and we had to take a chance,\" said Maher about going for the onside kick instead of squibbing the ball. \nThe Wildcats had to exhaust their timeouts, but forced the Falcons to go three and out. \nOn the punt return Strong ran it back 17 yards to the Becton 47 so the Wildcats had to go 53 yards with a little less than three minutes remaining in the game. \nAnd Becton took to the air as Bolwell would systematically move down the field and connect on four consecutive passes to get the Wildcats to the Saddle Brook 4 yard line. \nAnd then the sophomore signal caller took it in his own hands as he sprinted down the middle four yards for a touchdown with 90 seconds left in the game, cutting the Saddle Brook lead to 34-33. \"It was a read option, and I just saw the opening,\" said Bolwell. \nWithout Loremikan, Maher had no choice but go for the two-point conversion and the win. \nAnd it was the combination again of Bolwell-Strong as the quarterback connecting with Strong in the backfield, and the junior wide out took it the rest of the way to give Becton the 35-34 lead. \"It was just a normal roll out play,\" said Bolwell. \nBut Saddle Brook had some time remaining to comeback. But sophomore Nico Failla and the rest of the Wildcats defense would not let Saddle Brook quarterback Robert Lazzaro and the Falcons come back. \nFailla, brother of the starting Becton tailback Gianni Failla, would pick off a Lazzaro pass with 52 seconds left and secure the big victory. \n\"This team really came together as a team,\" said Bolwell about the comeback. \"We just dug deep and came together.\" \nBolwell would lead the way for the comeback, completing 18 of 29 passes for 238 yards, three touchdowns and the rushing touchdown. \nFor Becton the combination of Bolwell and Strong has developed into a lethal combination especially since both have made their debut on the varsity this year with Bolwell transferring from St. Joseph. Strong caught six passes for 66 yards and also a pair of two-point conversion catches. \n\"They work very well together,\" said Maher about the pairing and who added about Bolwell. \"Every game he is throwing better and better. He makes every throw work.\" Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:27:45.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
