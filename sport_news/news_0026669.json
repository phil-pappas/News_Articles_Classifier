The players of the Iowa State men’s and women’s basketball team had been introduced. The crowd roared and the music blared. \nThen Iowa State men’s coach Steve Prohm met his new team, leaping in the air, delivering hip checks before strolling around midcourt, imploring the fans to cheer louder. \nHilton Madness was off and so is a season with so much expectation and excitement attached to it. \n“It was great,” Prohm said of the event that highlighted Bill Fennelly’s women’s team and his own top-10 men’s squad. \n“Eight o’clock on a Friday night in the middle of October and you’ve got 9,000 people here. It’s humbling and it’s really, really impressive. “ \nThe 75-minute event catered to fans with a dunk contest, 3-point shootout and skills competition, which featured former Cyclone greats Marcus Fizer and Stacy Freese, both of whom were inducted into the ISU athletic hall of fame on Friday. \n“Before I came (to ISU),” senior All-American Georges Niang said, “I didn’t really know too much about this program. I knew a couple of big-time guys like Marcus and Craig Brackins. \n“It’s really cool when you can put a face to the name and really get to meet someone and learn their persona and how they talk. Just the way he carries himself is like a true champion.” \nHallice Cooke defeated women’s player Jadda Buckley in the 3-point shootout when he hit the moneyball as time expired. \nDeonte Burton was the dunk champion, elevating and finishing while donning Timberland boots on his feet. \n“Deonte’s crazy for that,” senior Naz Mitrou-Long said. \nBurton’s footwear and aerial stylings were one of the highlights of the evening. \n“He didn’t (clear it with me),” Prohm said, “but he didn’t have to. Tonight’s fun, and he’s a great athlete. He dunks every day in practice. He tries to dunk about 30 times in every drill. He should have won.” \nThe best part of the evening, however, was likely Niang’s work on the microphone, cajoling his teammates and stealing some comedic thunder from the Iowa Nice Guy and the night’s emcee, Scott Siepker. \n“I was thinking (comedian) Kevin Hart did his thing (recently at Hilton),” Niang said, “when are they going to bring the ‘Georges Niang Show’ out here? \n“We should start something up like that.” \nMitrou-Long progressing \nMitrou-Long continues to make steady progress as he recovers from surgery on both of his hips this off-season. \n“I’m getting better each practice,” he said, “getting my self-awareness back on the court, making some plays I felt like I was doing before. My last practice was probably my best one.” \nThe shooting guard has been essentially been participating in every-other ISU practice, but even his half-time participation has made a difference. \n“He brings a different level of energy to practice,” Prohm said. \nLong said he expects to be ready to play for ISU’s season-opener against Colorado on Nov. 13. \n“I’m ice bathing every night, rehabbing every day,” he said. “I’m praying that I should be good to go. Right now it should be good.” Rules for posting comments \nComments posted below are from readers. In no way do they represent the view of Stephens Media LLC or this newspaper.
