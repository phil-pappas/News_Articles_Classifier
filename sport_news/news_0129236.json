Tough loss, but I did better. Let’s try here to do better again,” Nadal, wearing a matador logo on his cap and T-shirt, said in Beijing. \n“I think I am working well. I am very motivated to go for that challenge that brings me the chance to overcome a tough situation for me. I love that feeling, and I am going to fight to make that happen.” \nNadal has not got further than the quarterfinals in Grand Slams this year, even on his beloved Roland Garros clay, and he has slipped to seventh in the world from second a year ago. \nBut the Spaniard has confounded expectations more than once by rebounding from injury problems to reclaim his place at tennis’ top table. \nNow he said the old confidence was coming back and he pledged to use his final tournaments of the year as preparation for next season, which includes the Australian Open in January. \n“It’s obvious that when you lose more than what you won, you lose your confidence, no? But the confidence comes back with victories and with good feelings on court,” he said. \n“In the practices, there are better feelings for me. Now it remains to compete a little bit better (in matches). But I think it’s coming.” \nThe Spaniard said he was working on returning the old intensity to his ferocious forehand, but more importantly, he was again finding it easier to regulate his emotions on court.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:59:36.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
