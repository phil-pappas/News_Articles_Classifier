The win, his fourth of the season, advances him to the third round no matter what happens at Kansas Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway. \n\"What a great car,\" Logano said. \"This makes Talladega way easier. I know it's on everyone mind's when this round started. It certainly helps us sleep easier for the next couple of weeks. ... Our team kept our heads up stayed confident. This helps us recharge our batteries and get ready for the next round.\" \nKevin Harvick finished second, followed by Martin Truex Jr., Denny Hamlin and Kurt Busch.

Third-place Kyle Busch suddenly decided not to pit at the last minute while second-place Kyle Larson decided he would pit. The two then collided — both sustained damage — and needed extra time on pit road for repairs. Larson apologized over his team radio. Gluck: Costly mistakes can be killer in second round of NASCAR's Chase \nBAD DAY FOR KENSETH: It was already a frustrating day for Matt Kenseth when he slid up the track and made contact with Ryan Newman on lap 175. Kenseth had the dominant car early, but lost his track position when he pitted for four tires. He was mired back in the field following a long pit stop and then seemed to cut up in front of Newman coming out of Turn 4. The resulting contact put Kenseth into the wall and also left Newman with some damage. Though Kenseth was able to stay on the lead lap for awhile, he hit the wall again with 130 laps to go and needed more repairs. It finally ended with roughly 90 laps to go, when Kenseth crashed into the wall one more time and finished off his day. \n\"Everything kind of snowballed,\" Kenseth said. \"I really look at it one race at a time to be honest with you. Today obviously was a bad day. We had a really fast Camry, but one thing led to another, to another, to another, and I made some mistakes.\" Dale Earnhardt Jr.: 'We hit fluid and flew into the freaking wall' \nEARNHARDT’S HOPES TAKE A HIT: On lap 69, Dale Earnhardt Jr. was racing for position when he came down on Carl Edwards in Turn 1 and Edwards made contact with Earnhardt’s rear bumper, which shot the No. 88 car up the track and into the wall. Earnhardt did not pit, but his tire went flat five laps later and he slammed the wall again. After pitting for repairs, he restarted in 38th place — one lap behind the leaders. Earnhardt rallied to 26th place, but then he slid through some apparent oil that was left over from when Justin Allgaier blew up on lap 180. The No. 88 car hit the wall even harder than before, which put him three laps down. \n\"I lost count how many times I hit (the wall) today,\" Earnhardt said. \"I put us in the wall the first time. And then they didn't clean up the oil, and I hit the wall again. ... We tried everything we could to get laps back, even after smashing in the fence all those times, we had speed. .... Other guys had trouble today too, so it's not over.\" \nTWO IN A ROW FOR JOHNSON: Six-time champ Jimmie Johnson, eliminated from the Chase last week at Dover International Raceway, had his second consecutive mechanical failure when his engine apparently expired after 257 laps. Johnson was running in the top five until that point. \nKAHNE’S DAY GOES FLAT: Kasey Kahne brushed the wall in the early stages of the race due to a flat tire and was forced to pit, which made him fall two laps down. But things got much worse shortly thereafter when he crushed the wall and had to go to the garage. Kahne was only able to complete 58 of the 334 laps when the team was unable to fix the car. \nRAIN RUINS THE FUN: NASCAR wasted no time in postponing the race on Saturday night after it became clear persistent rain would hang around much longer than originally forecast. The official word came at 7 p.m. ET Saturday — the scheduled start time of the race — and drivers had to wait 17.5 hours for the actual green flag. \nFollow Gluck on Twitter @jeff_gluck \nPHOTOS: 2015 Sprint Cup race winners", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:09:55.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
