Judge Lisa Ann Grant approved funds requested by the defense for a pathologist to examine Bella’s body.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below A probable cause hearing was set for November 19.\nBond put the hood of her sweatshirt up and tilted her head so her hair shielded her face. McCarthy cut his hair, which was in a ponytail during his first appearance.\nProsecutors say McCarthy, who was charged with murder, killed Bella Bond by punching her repeatedly in the stomach. Rachelle Bond was charged with accessory after the fact to murder. Both were charged with improper disposition of a body.\nThey have pleaded not guilty to their roles in the child’s death. Bond was held on $1 million bail, and McCarthy was held without bail.\nAfter initially keeping the toddler’s corpse in a refrigerator—and spending a few days high on heroin—the pair weighted her body, put it in a bag, and dumped it into the waters off the South Boston Seaport.\nThe child’s body was found on June 25 on the shores of Deer Island. Authorities spent months trying in vain to identify the brown-eyed, chubby-cheeked “Baby Doe” as tips poured in from around the world.\nDuring the hearing, a man believed to be Michael McCarthy’s father left without speaking to reporters. Joseph Amoroso, the man who claims to be Bella’s biological father, said he hopes the second autopsy uncovers more information.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:06:29.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
