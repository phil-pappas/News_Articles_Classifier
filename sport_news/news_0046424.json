Brett Davis / USA TODAY Sports FOX Sports Updated Oct 12, 2015 at 11:07p ET \nOle Miss stud offensive tackle Laremy Tunsil will be able to return to action on Oct. 24 versus Texas A&M. ‚Äî Laremy Tunsil (@KingTunsil78) October 13, 2015 \nThe NCAA notified Hugh Freeze's program of the decision on Monday night. Tunsil's seven-game suspension is in direct correlation with the Florida native receiving improper benefits. According to the NCAA, Tunsil will need to pay the value of the extra benefits to charity, and also get involved in community service. \n\"I take full responsibility for the mistakes I made and want to thank everyone for their continued support,\" said Tunsil. \"I want to apologize to my teammates, coaches, and the entire Ole Miss family for how my choices affected our program. This was a learning experience, and I'm looking forward to being back on the field with my team and redeeming myself.\" \nTunsil's return is significant in a number of ways. The offensive tackle is one of the most talented players in the entire SEC, regardless of position. With some extremely talented defensive ends remaining to play on the schedule ( Myles Garrett , Lewis Neal), he'll be counted on to protect signal-caller Chad Kelly . ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå @KingTunsil78 is BACK I been waiting to talk some noise with this boy got all the J's üö∂üèæ #TexasA &M ‚Äî Trae Elston#‚É£7‚É£ (@Trip7ERA) October 13, 2015 \n\"We have been supportive of Laremy throughout this process, and we are thankful he can return to competition starting with the Texas A&M,\" said Freeze. \"More important than his football ability is his character, and I am confident that Laremy will grow from this experience and continue to be a positive member of the University and our football team.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:11:44.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
