The Jets possessed the ball for 18:51 in the first half, compared to 11:09 for the Patriots. Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick lost a fumble on the game's second play (his eighth turnover of the year), which led to a Patriots field goal drive. But after that, he played fairly well. He finished 22-of-39 passing for 295 yards and two touchdowns. For the first time this year, he didn't throw an interception. The Jets were in the game at halftime, down 13-10. They even led, 17-16, early in the fourth quarter, and had a chance to go up 24-16. But wide receiver Brandon Marshall — who would later commit a foolish false start penalty on the game's final play — dropped a would-be touchdown pass on third-and-7 from the Patriots' 12. So the Jets had to settle for a field goal, and a 20-16 lead. The mistake came back to bite them, as the Patriots scored touchdowns on their next two possessions. Running back Chris Ivory, limited by hamstring tightness Sunday, was mostly ineffective . He gained 41 yards on 17 carries. He was especially limited in the first half, when he carried nine times for just 12 yards. He did make a 9-yard touchdown catch that put the Jets up 17-16 in the third quarter, though. Overall, the Jets did some good things offensively. Receiver Eric Decker abused cornerback Malcolm Butler, particularly on third down, to the tune of six catches for 94 yards. The Jets gained 372 yards. But they scored just two touchdowns on four red-zone trips. In addition to the Marshall drop, the Jets also sputtered on their second drive of the game. They had first-and-goal at the 4, and then second-and-goal at the 2. They couldn't punch it in, and had to settle for a field goal that knotted the score at 3-3. \nGrade: B- \nDefense: The Jets had no answer for Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, who caught 11 of his 16 targets, for 108 yards and a 15-yard touchdown that stretched the Patriots' lead to 30-20 in the fourth quarter. This is why he is, quite simply, the toughest player to cover the NFL. In the fourth quarter, Gronkowski caught five passes for 55 yards. (The Patriots had just two fourth quarter drives, and both resulted in touchdowns.) For the first time all season, the Jets on Sunday did not have a takeaway. The Patriots, on their final two possessions, drove 80 and 68 yards, and scored touchdowns both times, turning a 20-16 deficit into a 30-20 lead. On those drives, Brady completed a 27-yard pass on third-and-17, an 8-yard touchdown pass on third-and-6, and an 11-yard pass on third-and-10. He's a future Hall of Famer for a reason. Brady finished the game 34-of-54 passing for 355 yards and two touchdowns, both in the fourth quarter. He now has 36 career fourth quarter comebacks. On the final two drives Sunday, Brady completed 14 of 17 passes for 150 yards. The Patriots ran just three times on those two drives, and one was a Brady scramble. The Patriots had just nine rushes in the entire game. But before those two big fourth quarter drives, the Jets' defense had performed quite well. The Patriots had managed just three field goals and a short-field touchdown drive of 47 yards. Yet in the end, the Jets couldn't get Brady and the Patriots off the field when they needed to. \nGrade: B \nSpecial teams: This group continues to be a mess, for various reasons. Punter Steve Weatherford was put in a tough position, having to replace Ryan Quigley ( shin ) on short notice. Weatherford , by his own admission, was not prepared. And it showed. His 31-yard punt in the second quarter preceded that 47-yard touchdown drive by the Patriots. In the fourth quarter, Weatherford's 33-yard punt preceded the Patriots' 68-yard touchdown drive, which put them up 30-20. There were subtler issues, too. In the second quarter, Jeremy Kerley fair caught the ball at his own 8-yard line. The Jets then went three plays and out. Weatherford punted from his own 16. It was the 31-yard punt. So Kerley pinning the Jets deep with that ill-advised fair catch also contributed to the Patriots getting a short field after Weatherford's crummy punt. Nick Folk made all three of his field goal attempts Sunday. He connected from 20, 30, and 55 yards. The last one kept the Jets' small hopes alive, and allowed them to have one final shot, down 30-23, after they got the ball back via an onside kick that Marshall recovered. But Marshall's false start penalty on the game's final play killed that last-ditch comeback attempt. Folk had gone 2-for-3 on field goals three times this season, and 1-for-1 twice, so the 3-for-3 day was a positive. Folk's 55-yard field goal also tied his second-longest ever. He hit from 56 yards in 2010. He now has two 55-yarders. The other happened last year. \nGrade: C- \nCoaching: Jets head coach Todd Bowles made some questionable clock management decisions late in this game. On the Patriots' final drive, which resulted in their 30-20 lead, they got the ball back with 5:32 remaining. The Jets had all three of their timeouts left. But the Patriots burned the clock and scored the game-clinching touchdown with 1:13 remaining. Bowles opted to not use any of his timeouts on that drive. He would use them all on the Jets' next drive, which resulted in that 55-yard field goal by Folk. Consider that on four straight snaps during the Patriots' final drive, the clock went from 4:20 to 3:34 to 2:52 to 2:17. In that window, Bowles could've used a timeout, to give the Jets more time to come back. But he didn't. \nGrade: B \nDarryl Slater may be reached at dslater@njadvancemedia.com .
