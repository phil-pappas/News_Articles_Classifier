She's in position, she's confident, and she plays big. I think the key to her game is confidence and her technical ability.\" \nUMD is (4-4-0) overall this season and this weekend will visit in-state rival and top-ranked Minnesota.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:13:48.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
