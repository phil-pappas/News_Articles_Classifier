He also had career highs with 15 tackles for loss and 2½ sacks last season.\n“Obviously, any time you have a guy that has that kind of experience that he’s had and fine play that he’s had through the years, that certainly makes a huge difference,” Caldwell said of Levy returning. “Every year is different, but he adds a boost to us.”\nThe 28-year-old Levy signed a four-year, $33.7 million contract extension in August, but has yet to have a chance to provide some return on that investment this year. Despite the Lions starting 0-4, Caldwell said he doesn’t think about how Levy’s presence might’ve altered the start of the season.\n“It doesn’t cross my mind,” he said. “Never do I look at what-ifs and all that kind of stuff. That doesn’t make any difference. I know where we are, and I know where we’re trying to go. So, that’s the most important (thing) to us right now.”\nCaldwell declined to say how much Levy would play Sunday, but after being a full participant in practice Wednesday and Thursday, it looks like he’s ready to handle a full workload.\nWith Levy returning, the Lions now have to look for another way for Josh Bynes to get on the field as he’s been the team’s best linebacker this season. Bynes filled in on the weak side for Levy the first four games, but he could earn some snaps in the middle or on the strong side moving forward.\nIn addition to Levy, left tackle Riley Reiff will be the offensive captain, and running back Theo Riddick will be the special teams captain.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:42:09.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
