Bearcats sword the Knights David Wysong | Sports Editor newsrecord.org \nExtending the team’s unbeaten streak to nine consecutive victories Sunday, the University of Cincinnati women’s soccer team defeated the University of Central Florida Knights 2-0. \nThe Bearcat victory passed UC its first triumph over the Knights since 1983, alongside its undefeated first-four conference game record since 2002. \nFreshman forward Jordan Cotleur was the only Bearcat to plant the ball in the net, snagging her third and fourth goals of the season. \nCotleur’s first score came after an assist by sophomore midfielder Jaycie Brown in the 13th minute. The forward received the ball from Brown through the UCF defensive line and beat the goalie, chipping it over her head. \nThis goal opened the scoring up on offense and gave Cincinnati a lead in which was not threatened throughout the match, despite the Knights 12 shots fired at goal in attempt to get on the scoreboard. \n“I think the goalie was caught off guard and so were the defenders,” Cotleur said. “So, just stretching them out, which is what our game plan was and then finding the seams really worked out for us.” \nUC defense was the story of the game, as Bearcat senior goalie Sam Pavlika only made two saves throughout the match due to Bearcat defenders frequently holding a position to redirect or block the other 10 UCF shots. \nFor the second time of the night, Cotleur placed the ball into the net and iced the Knights’ attempt. Senior defender Kelly Latimer bent a free kick towards Cotleur, who made a leap in triple coverage to head the ball past UCF’s freshman goalie Vera Varis. \nThe final goal guaranteed the Bearcats’ victory. \nCincinnati continued to succeed in creating set pieces. The team was able to get nine corner-kick calls during the game. \nUC head coach Neil Stafford was pleased with the team’s performance. \n“I think it was a better team performance, overall,” Stafford said. “Again, some individual brilliance with Cotleur getting two goals today. I thought we were a bit more energetic and we created a few more problems [for UCF], which I’m happy to see. As long as we stick to the mentality that they’re going to deal with a very difficult team when they play Cincinnati, I’m happy with that.” \nCincinnati climbs to 8-2-4 on the season as the Bearcats gear up for another conference showdown at 7 p.m. Thursday against Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:28:53.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
