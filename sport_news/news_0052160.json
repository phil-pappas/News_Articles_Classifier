Forwards Christiaan Minella, Garrick Perry and Gabriel Levesque, and defenseman Steve Weinstein scored the goals for the Cyclones, who have won both of their preseason games against Wheeling this season. \nThe Nailers wasted little time getting on the board, as they quickly gained a 2-0 lead, 2:23 into the opening frame, on goals from forwards Connor Leen and Christophe Lalancette. \nThe Cyclones cut that lead in half a little over a minute later, when forward Joe Wilson found Minella on the back door after a 2-on-1 rush, and he stuffed it in past Wheeling netminder Brian Foster, cutting Cincinnati's deficit to 2-1. \nThat score held up throughout the remainder of the first period, and in the second, the Cyclones' power play came to life, when Weinstein took a pass from forward Branden Gracel and fired it past Foster, pulling the Cyclones even with the Nailers, 2-2, 6:16 into the middle frame. \nThe power play struck again just over two minutes later, when Perry took the puck behind the net and jammed it in on a wrap around to give the Cyclones a 3-2 lead, 8:25 into the second. \nCincinnati's offensive prowess continued late in the frame, as Levesque took control of a loose puck behind the net and tucked in a wrap around, giving the Cyclones a 4-2 lead after 40 minutes. \nThat was all the offense the Cyclones needed, as goaltender Brandon Whitney was perfect in his 31:35 of ice time, stopping all 18 shots he faced to preserve the 4-2 win. Netminder Neil Conway started the game for Cincinnati, and he turned aside nine of the 11 shots he faced in 28:25 of action. \nThe power play converted on two of its six opportunities, while the penalty kill shut down all three of Wheeling's chances. The Cyclones won the shot battle throughout most of the game, however Wheeling finished with a 29-25 edge on the shot clock. \nThe Cyclones now focus their attention to next Saturday, when they welcome in the Toledo Walleye to U.S. Bank Arena for the 2015-2016 season opener. Faceoff is scheduled for 7:35 p.m. \nInformation provided by the Cincinnati Cyclones Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:27:56.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
