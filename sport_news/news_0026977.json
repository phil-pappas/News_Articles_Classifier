And wide receiver Leonte Carroo was charged with simple assault stemming from an altercation involving his girlfriend and a recruiting ambassador with whom he had a previous romantic relationship. \nIn regards to Terry's alleged admission, Flood said the football program follows the university's drug policy . The incident involving Carroo and the recruiting ambassador raised questions about the appropriateness of intimate relationships between players or recruits and members of the recruiting staff. \nFlood said the football program does not have a policy prohibiting relationships between players and the recruiting ambassadors. \n\"My expectation with the players when they're in the Hale Center is that at all times they conduct themselves in a professional way,\" Flood said. \"I don't begin to think that I can control the personal relationships of students with other students when they're outside of this building. It's not something that I ask them about or not something I get involved with.\" \nRELATED: What did Kyle Flood say about his suspension? \nFlood suspended Carroo indefinitely after his arrest. The receiver was reinstated last week after the assault charge was dismissed when the alleged victim chose not testify. \nThe woman, who is a Rutgers student, quit her job with the football program after the incident. Student football recruiters are paid between $8 and $10 per hour and spend their shifts during the week making copies, stuffing envelopes and compiling lists of recruits who will be visiting, according to Kate Hickey , a senior associate athletic director. They also act as ambassadors on game days, introducing recruits to players, coaches and other prospects. \nFlood said the incident involving Carroo hasn't caused him to reevaluate the recruiting ambassador program. \n\"I think we've got a good program,\" Flood said. WATCH: Rutgers coach Kyle Flood returns from suspension with an apology Rutgers football coach Kyle Flood returned from his three-game suspension on Monday with an apology. The apology came during his first press conference with the media since his suspension in September. The suspension came after he violated a university compliance policy. (Video by Adya Beasley | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com) \nNJ Advance Media reported last week that a law firm that deals exclusively with potential NCAA rules violations is conducting a top-to-bottom review of the football program . Three officials familiar with the investigation told NJ Advance Media the two areas of focus are Terry's claims about the failed drug tests and the recruiting ambassador program. \nFlood said he will cooperate with the investigation. \n\"We have a very transparent program, and we'll fully cooperate with anything the university wants to look at,\" Flood said. \nAs for Carroo, Flood declined to divulge the conditions of the receiver's reinstatement to the team. \n\"I would keep those conditions to Leonte and (athletic director Julie Hermann) and myself,\" Flood said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:31:13.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
