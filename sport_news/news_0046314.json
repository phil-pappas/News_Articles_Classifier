Rigsby A French processor of rosin and turpentine oil will buy land from the Effingham County Industrial Development Authority and build a $43 million facility that will employ 40 people.\nIDA CEO John Henry said Wednesday that DRT will buy 65 acres in the Effingham Industrial Park, which is on the east side of Ga. 21 at Ebenezer Road, just north of Rincon.\nThe company will pay $30,000 per acre for 65 acres known as the Governor Treutlen site, for a total of $1.95 million.\nThe company, which will be known as DRT America, will begin construction in 2016 and start operations during the first half of 2017.\nHenry said the jobs will include a variety of positions and will be “high-wage” and “skilled.” He said he believes the average salary will be $40,000 a year, or possibly a little higher.\nThe $43 million figure includes land, facilities and equipment, Henry said.\nThe IDA has been working with the company since summer of 2014.\nDRT considered sites in three states but chose Effingham because of its proximity to pine forests and the port and its strong educational system.\nIDA Chairman Chap Bennett could not be reached immediately for comment, nor could the contact listed at DRT, company President Corey Schneider.\nHenry said in a news release issued late Wednesday that DRT has specialized in processing rosin and turpentine oil distilled from pine resin since 1932. This is the company’s first U.S. project.\n“The new production unit will enable DRT to distill locally sourced turpentine to better serve its existing markets and develop new products for the fragrance and terpene resin industries,” the release said. “This in turn will allow DRT to strengthen its position as a global leader and its relationship with its clients and suppliers.”\nON THE WEB:\nhttp://www.drt.fr/en.html", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14791623.jpg", "https://www.scribd.com/embeds/283997216/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&show_recommendations=true", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14791623.jpg", "https://www.scribd.com/doc/283997216/News-Release-DRT-Expands-Into-the-US", "http://www.drt.fr/en.html", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-07T13:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:09:07.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
