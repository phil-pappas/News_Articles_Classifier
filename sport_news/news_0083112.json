He was the 10-5A Defensive MVP after making 75 tackles and piling up 16 1/2 sacks and causing four fumbles.\nIn the spring, Madubuike worked on his speed while competing with the track team as one of the biggest sprinters you'll ever see. Every time Madubuike lined up for the 100 meters at a meet, someone would ask, \"Hey, are you a football player?\"\nMadubuike is considered by many as one of the nation's top 100 recruits in the Class of 2016.\nSome response to Madubuike's announcement from around the Twitterverse:\n#YESSIR !\nâ” Kevin Sumlin (@CoachSumlin) September 18, 2015\nMadubuike's pledge to #TAMU could be the first big domino on the defensive side of the ball to fall after top prospects see Chavis' defense\nâ” Taylor Hamm (@TaylorHamm247) September 18, 2015\nAggies land a massive commitment from big time target Justin Madubuike out of McKinney North! #YESSIR @JMadubuike15 pic.twitter.com/eHvCoyeG5q\nâ” TAMUHighlights á´´á´° (@TamuHighlights) September 18, 2015\nFollow @mattwixon\nOn Twitter:\n @mattwixon", "external_links": ["http://t.co/eHvCoyeG5q", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/TAMU?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/JMadubuike15", "http://twitter.com/mattwixon", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ItsAboutUs?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/TamuHighlights/status/644932417212411904", "https://twitter.com/mattwixon", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/YESSIR?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/TaylorHamm247/status/644933013126561792", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gig?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/CoachSumlin/status/644926750254743552", "https://twitter.com/JMadubuike15/status/644929759621705728"], "published": "2015-09-18T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:40:19.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
