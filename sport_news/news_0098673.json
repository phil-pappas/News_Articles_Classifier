That makes it very hard to win, and indeed, it was the 3rd quarter that largely cost the Jazz the game. \nA couple of those turnovers came from initial ball pressure on the Jazz's first perimeter action, where they switch the side of the ball in order to get the defense off-balance and get in better situations for their initial screening. The Suns, knowing it was coming, denied the Jazz's passes, \n\"We got stuff in our offense to counter that,\" Jazz swingman Gordon Hayward told me when I asked about those turnovers. \"You saw it in the first quarter, we did a couple of things, I got a back cut that sent me to the line. It's all just reads, man. \nNeto ball pressure \nJazz rookie PG Raul Neto has been successful with 94-foot ball pressure in his early action so far, creating steals even off of inbounds passes from the opposite baseline. \n\"I think it's a game with the other guy,\" Neto said. \"Sometimes I'm going to foul him, sometimes I'm gonna get a steal.\" \nEurope vs. NBA refereeing differences \nTibor Pleiss is coming over to the Jazz after spending several years in European basketball, most recently with FC Barcelona's team in the ACB. In 2013, Rudy Gobert underwent a similar move from European play to the NBA, and he has advice for Tibor Pleiss that comes from experience. \n\"I'm trying to help him,\" Gobert said. \"I know it's not easy, I went through it my first year.\" \nBut when asked about the biggest piece of advice he has for Pleiss, Gobert's answer surprised me: it's about the refereeing difference. \n\"In Europe, there's way more contact that they don't call,\" Gobert said. \"Here the paint is more open, so they can see the fouls.\" Gobert also expla \nPleiss picked up 4 fouls in just over ten minutes of action on Friday. Gobert had similar problems with fouls in his rookie season, but cleaned it up to a spectacular degree in year two, making him playable for long stretches. \nJazz struggle against bigs who can shoot the 3 \nI asked Quin Snyder whether he was worried about those types of opponents moving forward. \nNeto on SLC \nFriday, are taking a liking to Salt Lake City. I thought I'd ask newcomer Raul Neto about his first couple of months of living in SLC. \nQuin on no-PG lineups \nAgainst Phoenix, the Jazz held Trey Burke out for rest, leaving Raul Neto and Bryce Cotton as the Jazz's only point guards. While they did look at both Neto and Cotton, they also looked at a no-PG lineup, where Alec Burks, Hayward, and Rodney Hood are all on the floor at the same time. \nI asked Quin Snyder to evaluate what he's seen from that look, but he was hesitant, saying \"I've kinda been waiting to look at it all, since there's such a small (sample size).\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:36:38.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
