So not being able to get a full breath was uncomfortable, but then I was able to just kind of control it with shallow breaths. And then all the movement that I did, basically getting to the hospital, was very painful. Put the chest tube in to reinflate, to re-establish the pressure difference and help reinflate my lung. So that was probably the worst thing I've ever had to go through, painwise.\"\nZenner left Sunday's game after being sandwiched by two Bears defenders on a 7-yard run early in the second quarter.\nThe play that ended Zach Zenner's rookie year. Stumbled & took a shot from rookie safety Adrian Amos. https://t.co/eVry22uBSy @davebirkett\nâ€” The Answer (@MarloweAlter) October 19, 2015 He said he first thought he got the wind knocked out of him, but after a sideline examination, team doctors escorted him to the locker room. At halftime, he was taken to a hospital by ambulance.\nZenner spent two nights in the hospital, where he said he had a constant stream of visitors and got phone calls from Lions coach Jim Caldwell and general manager Martin Mayhew.\n\"(All things) considering, I feel really good,\" Zenner said. \"Trying to control my body movements where it's like, 'Eh.' It's the little things. All of a sudden, you move a certain way, and it's like, 'Ooh, that one got to me a little bit.' But for the most part, sitting still, I feel good.\"\nZenner, who's second on the Lions with 60 rushing yards on 17 carries, said the timing of his injury has been even tougher to deal with than the pain.\nThe Lions are 1-5 with the NFL's last-ranked rushing offense, and Zenner appeared to be on his way to supplanting Joique Bell as the team's' between-the-tackles complement to Ameer Abdullah when he got hurt.\n\"That's the hardest pill to swallow, honestly,\" Zenner said. \"Just finally worked so hard to get to that point, and then have it all end so suddenly. But at the same time, I'm going to be getting back, getting ready to rock next year.\"\nFor now, Abdullah, Bell and Theo Riddick will continue to split time in the Lions' backfield. But with no ribs displaced, Zenner said he's close to feeling normal again.\n\"I'll probably be up and running around next week,\" he said. \"It's all whatever I can handle. There's nothing you can do.\"\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nLions' Joique Bell says return to the field is near\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nLions rookie RB Abdullah knows foes gunning for fumbles\nContact Dave Birkett at dbirkett@freepress.com.
