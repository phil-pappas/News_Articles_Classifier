After four birdies on the front nine, he also birdied 15 and 18. \n\nEngland's Justin Rose carded a 68 and was two shots off the pace in a group of eight players on 204. \n\nHe was joined by Argentinean rookie Emiliano Grillo (65), Jason Bohn (64), Kyle Reifers (65), Canadian Graham DeLaet (69), Harold Varner (69), Venezuela's Jhonattan Vegas (69) and Will Wilcox (69). \n\nWorld number three Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland struggled with his putter for the third straight day. \n\nHis 71 left him eight shots adrift in a tie for 39th. \n\n\"Not to be able to break 70 today is quite disappointing,\" said McIlroy, whose only two birdies came at par-fives on which he missed eagle attempts. \n\n\"I think it's more mental than anything else,\" McIlroy said. \"Whenever you don't see anything go in, it makes it harder and harder each and every hole that goes by.\" \n\nMcIlroy also endured a scary moment when, having just chipped on the 17th green, a drive by Grillo narrowly missed hitting him. \n\nThe with the par-four playing at 296, Grillo opted to go for the green, and thought McIlroy and the others in his group were out of the way. \n\n\"I heard that I almost hit him, but I really apologize,\" he said. \n\nMcIlroy made light of it. \n\n\"Missed me by a couple of inches,\" the four-time major champion said. \"Would've put me out of my misery, to be honest with you.\" Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:29:41.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
