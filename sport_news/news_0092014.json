Second-half goals keep Ballston Spa boys' soccer perfect 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Guilderland\nThe Ballston Spa boys' soccer team has never gotten off to the start it has this season, and the Scotties hoped their quest for perfection would continue on Thursday.\nBallston Spa shook off a slow start in their Suburban Council battle with Guilderland and remained unbeaten on the season with a 2-0 win at Guilderland High School .\n\"We're pretty excited about it,\" Scotties senior Connor DeFilippis said. \"In the first half, we were just surviving. In the second half, we managed to control and get opportunities.\"\nBallston Spa, ranked No. 6 in the state in Class AA, improved to 11-0 overall and 10-0 in the Suburban Council.\n\"It's absolutely huge to go 11-0 and keep the streak alive and keep our confidence high,\" Ballston Spa goalie Rylie Hall said.\nScotties coach Gary Preece said his team's latest win was huge, especially considering Ballston Spa has a tough task ahead of it on Tuesday when it will play host to Bethlehem (9-3, 9-2).\n\"The teams are so tough, you can't take anyone for granted,\" Preece said. \"We have to be on our game.\"\nBallston Spa and Guilderland entered halftime locked in a scoreless tie.\nThe Scotties finally capitalized with 28 minutes remaining in the game on a goal by Colby Obrecht .\n\"In the second half we started maintaining the ball, moving it around well and keeping it,\" Preece said. \"Then we started to play our game.\"\nFive minutes after Obrecht's tally, Ballston Spa senior Griffen MacWatters pushed his team's lead to 2-0.\n\"I saw (DeFilippis) dribbling down the sideline and I knew I had to make the run into the box,\" MacWatters said. \"I knew he was going to draw it back because that's what he does. Easy finish.\"\nGuilderland nearly got on the board with four minutes remaining, but a shot hit off the crossbar and Hall went on to secure his sixth shutout of the season.\nBallston Spa has allowed only two goals in its past five games.\n\"(Hall) is tremendous,\" Preece said. \"He has great work ethic and always works hard in practice and his skills have been phenomenal this year.\"\nOf his defense in front of him, Hall said, \"They've been absolutely outstanding. I thank them after every game for how good they did.\"\nBallston Spa has five games remaining, including three at home, in the regular season. Four of its five opponents have records below .500.\n\"We're toward the end-of-the-season stretch, so winning now is important going into sectionals,\" MacWatters said. \"We want to keep winning.\"\njkoehler@timesunion.com • 518-454-5411 • @JKoehlerTU", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/21/8725573/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/21/8725574/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/21/8725577/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/21/8725575/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/21/8725576/5/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/21/8725576/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/21/8725576/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/21/8725574/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/21/8725577/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/21/8725573/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/21/8725573/5/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/21/8725575/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/21/8725577/5/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/21/8725574/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/21/8725575/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:47:05.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
