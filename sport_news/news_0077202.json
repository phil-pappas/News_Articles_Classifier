(AP) - After about 2Â½ months of closure, the westbound span of the U.S. 84 bridge over the Mississippi River is slated to reopen Monday.\nThe Natchez Democrat reports ( http://bit.ly/1NxYa4f ) the westbound bridge was closed in late July for what the Mississippi Department of Transportation characterized as \"rare, but critical\" pin and link replacement work. Traffic on the westbound span was rerouted to run headtohead with traffic on the eastbound span with a concrete divider between lanes.\nAn MDOT spokesman said Friday the eastbound span - which runs from Vidalia, Louisiana, to Natchez - would maintain onelane traffic for approximately one week while the contractor performs additional work. The eastbound span will reopen to loads wider than 14 feet once the concrete barriers and lane closures are removed.\nInformation from: The Natchez Democrat, http://www.natchezdemocrat.com/\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
