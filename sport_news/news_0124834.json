The team reached the last 16 at the last World Cup, but though Klinsmann set relatively modest goals for the calendar year of 2015, his team has fallen short of them.\nHe wanted victory in the Gold Cup over the summer, but didn’t get it, falling to Jamaica in the semifinals. Failing that, he wanted qualification for the 2017 Confederations Cup to come through the second chance saloon of Saturday’s CONCACAF Cup showdown with Mexico, but that fell apart too.\nAs much as anything, he wanted the nation’s Olympic squad to book its place in Rio, yet that is also in great peril, following a defeat to Honduras that makes qualification a long shot, at best.\nKlinsmann is a positive man with a glass half-full outlook, but he is getting close to running on empty in the public goodwill stakes. For while his team responded twice against Mexico, bouncing back to equalize after falling behind early in regulation and in the opening minutes of extra time, they never truly looked like winning the game, or grasping full control of it.\nUSA TODAY\nMexico fans outnumber U.S. fans at CONCACAF Cup in Pasadena\nAnd not just does Klinsmann no longer have the total belief of the American soccer public, he doesn’t have a Plan A anymore either. That floated away into the Southern California sky the moment Paul Aguilar slammed home his superb volleyed winning goal and sent the Rose Bowl erupting into a sea of green joy.\nKlinsmann wanted tournament soccer to prepare his charges for the experience of a World Cup. That meant the Gold Cup this year, the Copa America featuring some of the best teams from South America coming to U.S. soil next summer, and the Confederations Cup the year after that.\nWell, that didn’t work out so well. The Gold Cup was a disappointing farce, the Copa America may not even happen due to FIFA’s corruption scandal and it will be Mexico heading to Russia for the Confederations Cup instead.\nWith the qualifying campaign for the 2018 World Cup due to start next month, Klinsmann looks like a coach short on ideas. He wouldn’t admit as much of course, because, as an eternal optimist, he doesn’t believe it is true.\nSuch a cheery outlook is admirable and commendable and you would hope it can rub off on some of his demoralized players following the heartbreaking nature of Aguilar’s 118th minute strike.\nYet it is hard to imagine followers of the national team will share his bright outlook right now, through the haze of this defeat. They see only a cup that is empty and a trophy that passed into Mexican hands.\nGALLERY: SCENES FROM THE CONCACAF CUP\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Highlights from USA-Mexico CONCACAF Cup match Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!
