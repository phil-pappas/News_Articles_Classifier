The players will look forward to it,\" he said. \n\"I haven't lost a derby yet (won one, drawn five) and they are always good games. \n\"We are point behind Everton - I know the media and written press will build the game up but we will stay calm. \n\"I am immensely enjoying the job, it is a great challenge and it is a rebuilding.\" \nRodgers defended his decision to make significant changes for Europe, as he did a fortnight ago when they drew their opener in Bordeaux. \n\"For this game, there were a number of players we needed to be careful with like Daniel (Sturridge) that were coming back from injuries,\" he added. \n\"There is no doubt we want to qualify and get through to the knockout stages but we are picking teams to get a result. \n\"Away in Bordeaux a lot of young players played but we are still going up in games. \n\"The story of the game was obvious; we started well, got in front, gave away a poor goal and then created chances and should have maybe won a lot more comfortable but unfortunately ended up drawing and a bit frustrated. \n\"We have enough chances to win the game and that is the disappointment.\" \nSion boss Didier Tholot was more than satisfied with a draw. \n\"I am very pleased. It is a job well done. I had a plan and my players put it into action. We are very happy with the point we gained here,\" he said.
