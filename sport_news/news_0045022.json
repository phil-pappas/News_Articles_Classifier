That's a very good Baylor team and they just kept going toe-to-toe with them at the end, so I was proud of that. But we reverted back to some bad habits as far as penalties and turnovers in this game and against a top-five team in the country, you can't have that happen. So I don't think we really gave ourselves an opportunity to win the game like we have the previous first four.\"\nOn the defensive effort:\n\"You know, they are growing up. I think last year, I don't know if they would have had that same fight and they fought hard. It wasn't pretty and you got to give Baylor, like I said, a ton of credit.\"\nOn Baylor's offense:\n\"That's the best group of wide receivers I've ever coached against by far. Their quarterback - he was on the money. He can move around, make all the throws. [Shock Linwood] is a great player. They're loaded. So you've got to give them a lot of credit.\"\nOn the performance of Mahomes and Lauderdale's injury status:\n\"I thought Pat played fairly well. He got behind and got out of our game plan and so it was tough. He hung in there on some stuff, not being 100 percent. But, you know, you lose Devin early and a couple others. Key receivers are out and I thought he did a good job of hanging with some of those young guys.\"\n\"And I'm not sure on Devin's status. I was just told he'd be out for the rest of the game.\"\nOn whether Mahomes is still favoring his injury:\n\"Yeah, more than you'd like. He's really snapping that ball off and putting pressure on that leg. You can tell he's not that comfortable with it yet. But it was dramatically better than it was last weekend and the beginning of the week. And so, hopefully, we can take another step this week and he feels that much better next Saturday.\nOn Zach Austin's career day:\n\"It was great to see. He works very hard. You know, we rewarded him with a scholarship here in camp and well deserved and he's a guy - he's a gamer. He's a guy who is best when the lights are on, and couldn't be more proud of him coming out and making those plays like he did.\"\nBRANDEN JACKSON\nOn the confidence level of Texas Tech's defense:\n\"Everyone in the locker room is down right now, as they should be. Just feel like we didn't get it done and the scoreboard showed that. But confidence isn't lost. We played a good team who had our number this week and we'll forget about this game and get on to the next week. And, as a defense, that's what you've got to do. You can't really harp too much during the season on what goes wrong. A landslide can occur. We don't need that to happen.\nOn how to keep the team on edge during preparation for Iowa State:\n\"That will probably be the easiest thing because it's a senior-led group, mostly guys in the senior year. We're trying to set the tone for long and after we're gone and show teams how to be resilient and how to keep playing hard and keep fighting whenever things aren't going your way. And we're going to have to lead this team and we can't hang our heads knowing that we got to get our guys behind us. So we'll be able to get our edge and keep our edge for next week because we don't have a choice but to do that.\"\nJARED KASTER\nOn keeping spirits from getting too low:\n\"That's something [Branden Jackson] and I talked about in the locker room. You can't let this be a landslide, you can't just take it all downhill from there. You have to bounce back; you have to have a great week of practice. We still have a really good opportunity to finish the season off really good and that's something that we're going to have to push as older guys, that, you know, there's still a lot of football left to be played.\"\nOn the mental mistakes from the offensive line:\n\"It's just unacceptable. And I'll take responsibility for that. I'm the older guy that they really pushed to emphasize that during the offseason. And that's something that we can't have - can't let that happen to our offense. That's one of the things that really just kills us is ourselves.\"\nOn blocking for a quarterback that can extend plays:\n\"We just keep going until the whistle blows. That's something coach Hays really emphasizes on with us. When you've got a quarterback that can scramble like Pat does, you have to keep your point of attack until the whistle blows and that's something that you do. And, you know, he's able to create plays, though, which is good. But yeah, being up front, you just go until the whistle's blown. Finish your guy. That's what we're taught and that's what we try to do.\"\nBaylor 63, Texas Tech 35: Complete coverage\nÂ\nBox score\nDiscuss this game and the Big 12 with Chuck Carlton on Thursday;Â ask questions now\nPhotos:Â Baylor shows up in grey, makes Tech pay in AT&T Stadium rout\nFive thoughts: Statement win for Bears?\nBaylor quotable: Art Briles says Bears 'trying to prove we belong'\nTownsend: Running Bears step over Tech on potential path back to Arlington\nBaylor's Linwood sets career high with 221 yards against Texas Tech\nFive thoughts: Sloppy play leads to another loss in the series\nTexas Tech quotable:Â Baylor WRs 'best group' Kingsbury has coached against\nTexas Tech defense has another lapse, allowing Baylor big yardage\nOn Twitter:\n @MikeDuPont_", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/townsend-running-bears-step-tech-potential-path-back-arlington", "http://d-news.co/SYNiW", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/baylors-linwood-sets-career-high-221-yards-texas-tech", "https://twitter.com/MikeDuPont_", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/texas-tech-defense-another-lapse-allowing-baylor-big-yardage", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/texas-tech-quotable-corey-coleman-baylor-wrs-best-group-kingsbury-coached-seniors-rally-teammates", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/baylor-quotable-win-texas-tech-dominant-defense-exceptional-tough-red-raider-attack", "http://dallasnews.stats.com/cfb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=201510030079&home=79&vis=86&final=true", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesportsgallery/2015/10/03/photos-baylor-shows-grey-makes-texas-tech-pay-att-stadium-rout", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/five-thoughts-sloppy-play-paces-texas-tech-fifth-straight-loss-baylor"], "published": "2015-10-04T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:58:06.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
