I admire him,\" the former Manchester United boss told ESPN. \"I know Jurgen pretty well through our meetings at coaches' classes in Geneva. \n\"Strong personality, very strong, very stubborn, determined and his performances, and his career at Dortmund was a stellar rise to the top and I think he'll do very well. \n\"I don't like saying that, being Liverpool, because I'm worried about it but, no, he'll do well.\" \nKlopp will have to work with a transfer committee at Anfield and does not anticipate any problems doing so, but Ferguson has questioned whether the system can work in the long run. \n\"Why give him a job if he can't do it?\" said the Scot, who famously made good on his promise to \"knock Liverpool off their perch\" as he took United beyond the Reds' 18 English titles. \n\"When they're sitting around that table to appoint a manager, do they say, well, 'He can be part of the committee?' That's wrong, and I don't think Jurgen Klopp will accept that.\" \nKlopp, meanwhile, said Liverpool was the only club he spoke to before taking up the Anfield role and dismissed previous speculation linking him with a move to Bayern Munich. \nThe 48-year-old told Sky Sports in Germany he had never spoken to the Bavarian club and said he hopes former rival in the dugout Pep Guardiola stays at the Allianz Arena for the next decade. \n\"No, actually I don't know anything about that and this is not relevant to me,\" he said. \n\"I never had a certain career plan and I can assure you that I never talked to Bayern Munich. I also hope that Guardiola will stay there for another 10 years.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:08:46.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
