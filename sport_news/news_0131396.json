NEW YORK — Steven Matz wasn’t at Citi Field on Friday. Instead he was at the doctor, trying to figure out why his back isn’t feeling better.\nAnd now the Mets are left to evaluate what his role on the postseason roster might be — if there’s a spot for the rookie pitcher at all.\nInitially, the Mets thought the injury — which surfaced earlier this week after Matz fell asleep in an awkward position — was minor.\nThat’s not the case anymore.\n“I think the concern level has certainly gone up,” general manager Sandy Alderson said. “It hasn’t seemed to get better. I probably downplayed it a little too much at the outset, based on hope rather than information.”\nMatz was supposed to pitch in relief this weekend against the Nationals — Friday’s night’s game was rained out, but the teams will play a doubleheader today. It would have been a good opportunity for Matz to get in some much-needed reps before the postseason; he hasn’t pitched since Sept. 24 in Cincinnati.\nBut manager Terry Collins acknowledged that probably won’t happen.\n“Right now,” Collins said. “I don’t see how he’s going to be ready to pitch this weekend.”\nMatz was penciled in to start Game 4 of the National League Division Series. But if he doesn’t pitch this weekend, he will have gone 18 days between major league starts — a seemingly massive gamble for the Mets to take in a game their season could be riding on.\nThe best-case scenario would have Matz, somehow, pitch this weekend. If his back is feeling better today, that would allow him to pitch Sunday, Collins said.\nThe Mets were still holding out hope for that.\n“The fact that it hasn’t responded particularly well is concerning,” Collins said. “But that doesn’t mean that it won’t respond quickly over the next few days. These things are sort of hard to predict.”\nIf Matz doesn’t pitch this weekend, Alderson said he could still make the postseason roster, as a starter or as a reliever. But the Mets would still want him to pitch somewhere before next Friday, when they must set their roster before Game 1 of their series against the Doctors.\nCollins said Matz could pitch next week in the instructional league in Port St. Lucie, Fla. Collins also said the Mets won’t judge how well Matz pitches in the instructional league when deciding his postseason fate.\n“Am I going to look and see how he does down there? No,” Collins said. “It’s going to be at noon. There’s going to be six people there. It’s going to be hot. So nothing dictates except the workload. And if he goes down and gets through that and gets out OK, I’d probably have to say there’s a good shot he’d be on. So I’m not worrying about results. I’m worrying about his health right now.”\nAnd no matter what happens, the Mets will be gambling on Matz’s health if they make him a part of their postseason.\nIf he makes it through an instructional league start, they put him on the NLDS roster and Matz has a relapse, the Mets won’t be able to replace him. That’s a gamble they may not be willing to take with a healthy Bartolo Colon able to start in Matz’s place.\nAlderson acknowledged that these are all factors in the decision. But he’s not in a hurry.\n“Well, one important point is that we don’t have to make a decision until [next Friday],” Alderson said. “So a lot can happen during that time — in terms of physical health and as well as actual innings pitched.\n“If we decide that Steven is not in the rotation, for whatever reason, he’ll be considered for the bullpen,” Alderson continued. “And either be put in, or not, based on probably a whole different criteria. So, again, we’ll just have to see what happens.”\nEmail: vasqueza@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:10:32.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
