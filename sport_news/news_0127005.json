We have been looking forward to this game for a couple of years.” Edwards, defensive coach of the Welsh side, is also relishing a contest with Australian attack guru Stephen Larkham. \n“He did a marvellous job in exploiting the space in and around the ruck against England and that is something we have worked on this week,” Edwards said. \n“Stephen Larkham is one of the greatest players I ever saw play the game and he is one of the best coaches now. I am in a competitive situation with him this week and hopefully that brings out the best in me.” \nThe switch of George North from the wing to outside centre is aimed at getting him more opportunity to run at Australia. \n“North has worked very hard on his defence, even though he is a naturally attacking player, and he will get more ball than on the wing,\" Edwards said. \n“With guys that have his ability, you just want to get the ball into his hands and see how he goes.” \nEdwards hinted that Wales would feel more comfortable with a likely quarter-final against Scotland which, if they won, could lead to another Six Nations opponent in France or Ireland. \n“If we win we will meet teams that we play against more regularly and that familiarity, knowing more about your opponent, helps,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:14:00.879+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
