The victim told investigators the argument turned physical and Hurst began to push and her and pull her hair.\nSt. Bernard Parish Sheriff's deputies responded to the incident and arrested Hurst for simple battery.\nFollowing the arrest, the NOPD Public Integrity Bureau placed Hurst on suspension. PIB also confiscated Hurst's department-issued property and firearm.\nHurst made headlines in March of 2011 after photos and videos posted on a video-upload website showed a woman wearing a real NOPD uniform shirt inside two Uptown bars.\nIn 2014, he was placed on emergency suspension without pay on following allegations of domestic abuse. He was charged with attempted murder, but those charges were later dropped by the District Attorney's Office.\nHurst was assigned to the NOPD Fifth District.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
