The NFL owners met for close to nine hours Wednesday at the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan and discussed a number of topics ranging from player safety to the possibility of a franchise - or three - relocating to Los Angeles.\nRoger Goodell addressed the media at the conclusion of the meetings. Here are three takeaways from the commissioner's 20-minute session.\n1. A MOVE TO LOS ANGELES IS IMMINENT\nThe owners spent a substantial portion of the day discussing the status of three teams - the Raiders, Chargers and Rams - moving west to Los Angeles. Goodell said he expects the potential relocations to come to a vote in the future. The prospective teams would need the approval of 24 of the 32 owners.\nAll three organizations have struggled to build new stadiums in their respective cities, which Goodell said was a key factor in the momentum behind relocation to Los Angeles.\n\"The ownership was very thoughtful today. They expressed a great deal of concern for the communities where these teams are playing now,\" Goodell said, \"but also recognizing that we need to find long-term solutions here. I think there's also interest in being back in the entertainment capital of the world.\"\n2. REPLAY REFORM A POSSIBLITY\nThe NFL suffered through a public and egregious refereeing error Monday night in Seattle when a blown call in the end zone ended up costing the Lions a game against the Seahawks.\nThe play was not reviewable on instant replay, which drew a lot of questions and concerns about why the NFL hasn't expanded its replay to include every play on the field - an idea Patriots coach Bill Belichick has supported.\nGoodell was asked about the play Wednesday, and said instant replay \"clearly is going to be reviewed again.\"\n\"I think there's a lot of obstacles to having every play reviewed,\" Goodell continued. \"But there are other alternatives that can deal with these issues, and we're going to have to address that.\"\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE.\n3. CONCUSSION PROTOCOL IS WORKING\nAnother big chunk of the owners' meeting was spent talking about player health and safety, more specifically concussions, which Goodell referred to as the league's \"highest priority.\"\nSenior vice president of health and safety policy Jeff Miller presented some findings to the owners in the afternoon. And the league has in fact noticed that their concussion protocol - including a broader definition of a defenseless receiver, a heightened focus on helmet-to-helmet contact and more rigorous testing - has led to tangible results, not to mention what Goodell called \"changes to our culture.\"\nMiller reported a 25-percent decrease in total concussions from last year, a 35-percent decrease in concussions suffered in games over the past three years and a 43-percent decrease in concussions on helmet-to-helmet hits over the same three-year period. Meanwhile, Miller didn't find any increase in knee injuries over the past five years.\nTags: roger goodell", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:39:00.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
