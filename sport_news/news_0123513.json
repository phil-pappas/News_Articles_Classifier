It will be the Yankees' first playoff game since 2012, but they're not exactly charging into the postseason. \nAfter clinching a wild-card berth on Thursday, the Yankees finished their season with three straight losses at Camden Yards against a team that finished with a .500 record. The Yankees lost six of their last seven games to finish with 87 wins, which is three more than last season and two more than 2013. \nThey had three chances to clinch home-field advantage on their own but wouldn't have done so without Goldschmidt's homer. \n\"The best team's going to win on Tuesday,\" manager Joe Girardi said. \"That's the bottom line.\" \nWith a losing record since the end of July, the Yankees have been underwhelming on offense, injured in their rotation, and thin in their bullpen. It was the bullpen that especially cost them on Sunday. \nWith expanded rosters, the Yankees are carrying 20 pitchers. Of the ones who had thrown more than eight big-league innings this season, none had a higher ERA than Chris Capuano and Bryan Mitchell. \nYet those were the first two relievers Girardi used in a game the Yankees badly wanted to win. \nStarter Michael Pineda lasted just 3⅔ innings because Girardi lost faith in him after three runs, six hits and 83 pitches. Capuano was brought in to face the lefty Ryan Flaherty with two outs, a runner at first and the Orioles leading 3-1. \nCapuano had been designated for assignment four times this season, but he'd struck out back-to-back lefties in his most recent relief appearance, and so Girardi used him once again as a lefty specialist. \nCapuano allowed a strange single to Flaherty – the ball hit off Capuano's leg and spun just out of the reach of second baseman Dustin Ackley – then he allowed a two-run single to another lefty, Gerardo Parra. With that, the Orioles were up 5-1. \nThe fifth inning started with Mitchell, who had been a solid long reliever before he was hit in the face by a line drive on Aug. 17. Since then, he'd allowed 10 runs in 8⅓ innings. He opened the fifth with a walk and a two-run home run by Chris Davis to make it 7-1. \nTwo months ago, those innings might have belonged to Chasen Shreve, but Shreve's breakout season crumbled in recent weeks and the Yankees have searched in vain for a reliable middle-innings alternative. \nThe Yankees' offense managed a mild rally with a late RBI triple from Didi Gregorius and an RBI single by Greg Bird, but the bullpen coughed up two more runs and the Yankees finished the season having scored more than four runs in only two of its final 12 games. 1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1RpJLFK TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:31:20.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
