Hinch made seemed to work in Game 1 of the AL Division Series. Every move he tried in Game 2 seemed to go awry.\nThe Kansas City Royals took advantage, rallying from a three-run hole for a 5-4 victory Friday that evened their series at 1-1 as it shifts to Houston.\n“We didn’t execute,” Hinch said. “That’s baseball.”\nIt didn’t work when Hinch pulled starter Scott Kazmir in the sixth inning, as Oliver Perez and the rest of the Astros bullpen let Kansas City score twice and knot the game 4-all.\nNor when Hinch pulled his outfielders in to start the seventh, and Alcides Escobar lofted a triple off Will Harris (0-1) over their heads. Ben Zobrist followed with a go-ahead single.\nAnd certainly not when Hinch pinch ran with Carlos Gomez in the ninth, and the speedster wandered too far off first base. Royals closer Wade Davis snapped a throw to Eric Hosmer , and he neatly snagged it on one hop as Gomez dived back to the bag. Gomez was initially ruled safe, but the call was overturned upon review for the second out of the inning.\nJose Altuve then grounded out, giving Davis the save.\nIt was a crucial victory considering what awaits in Game 3 on Sunday: Astros ace Dallas Keuchel, who was 15-0 at home this season. Edinson Volquez will start for the Royals.\n“We needed the win. We didn’t want to go on the road down 2-0,” said Lorenzo Cain , who doubled during the Royals’ sixth-inning rally.\nTwo starters acquired with October in mind, Scott Kazmir and Royals counterpart Johnny Cueto , pitched mostly to a stalemate. That meant the outcome hinged on the bullpens, and Kelvin Herrera (1-0) and Ryan Madson each tossed a scoreless inning for Kansas City.\nColby Rasmus homered, doubled and drove in two runs for Houston, becoming the first player in major league history with an extra-base hit in his first six postseason games. George Springer had a pair of RBIs after hitting a solo shot in the series opener.\nThe Astros jumped on Cueto right from the start. Rasmus doubled in a run in the first, and Springer added a two-run knock in the second as restless Royals fans began to shower their ace with boos.\nSalvador Perez got one back for Kansas City with a homer to left in the bottom half, but Rasmus matched him with his third in three games this postseason.\nKazmir allowed a run in the third, but otherwise had K.C. off balance until the sixth inning.\nStill trailing 4-2, Cain got the Royals’ tying rally started with a double, and Hinch called for Oliver Perez. He allowed back-to-back singles and a walk to load the bases for Josh Fields , who walked Salvador Perez on four pitches to tie the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:20:57.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
