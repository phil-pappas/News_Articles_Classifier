(Photo: Steve Perez, Detroit News) \nDavid Goricki of The Detroit News looks ahead at this week’s top games, and looks back at the best from last week. \nThis week’s top games \nAll games at 7 p.m. Friday, unless noted\nDetroit King (8-0) vs. Detroit Cass Tech (7-1) at Ford Field: This is a rematch from a classic 31-28 OT win by King in Week 5 on an 18-yard field goal by Anwar Miah. Armani Posey, in his second start for King, threw for 129 yards and two TDs and senior running back Martell Pettaway ran for 134 yards and a TD. Junior quarterback Rodney Hall ran for 173 yards and connected with Donovan Peoples-Jones for a score.\nRomeo (8-0) at Utica Eisenhower (5-3): Romeo has been outstanding all season with a tremendous defense. Eisenhower is coming off a pair of impressive wins, knocking off Chippewa Valley (17-3) and Warren Mott (30-9) to put itself in position to earn a state playoff spot with another upset win in the season finale.\nDetroit Jesuit (5-3) at Redford Thurston (5-3): U-D ended its 35-game losing streak in the Catholic League Central with a 34-0 win over Birmingham Brother Rice Friday. Now, U-D needs another big effort from quarterback/safety Scott Nelson against a talented Thurston team for the right to advance to the state playoffs.\nAnn Arbor Pioneer (6-2) at Birmingham Groves (8-0): Groves has been impressive during its run to the OAA Blue Division championship, allowing an average of just 5.5 points this season, including five shutouts. But, Groves has yet to face a running back like Pioneer junior Antjuan Simmons, who has received more than a dozen offers in the last month, including one from Michigan State.\nOrchard Lake St. Mary’s (6-1) vs. Warren De La Salle (6-2) at Ford Field, 7 p.m. Saturday: De La Salle dominated OLSM in the first meeting this season, 31-8 at St. Mary’s in Week 5. It will be interesting to see how De La Salle rebounds from a 21-14 overtime loss to Detroit Catholic Central in this Catholic League championship game.\nLast week’s top games \nMacomb Dakota 35, Sterling Heights Stevenson 28 (OT): Junior Brett Droski, in just his second start at quarterback, led Dakota back from a 28-21 deficit to the comeback win to give it its fourth consecutive MAC Red championship. Junior Kaiser Carleton ran for 88 yards and three TDs, including a 10-yard run on the first play of overtime. Stevenson had 329 yards rushing, including 149 on 14 carries by Andrew Detmers, who scored on a 57-yard run.\nNorthville 23, Plymouth 20: Quarterback Justin Zimbo scored on a 4-yard run with 1:11 left for the difference in the KLAA Kensington Conference championship game. Zimbo threw for 190 yards and ran for 99.\nDetroit Catholic Central 21, Warren De La Salle 14 (OT): Freshman quarterback Austin Brown connected with Jack Morris for a 6-yard TD pass play in overtime for the difference. Tyler Laurentius made sure Catholic Central (6-2, 3-1) earned a share of the Catholic League Central title by intercepting a Josh Wilk pass in overtime. Still, De La Salle (6-2, 3-1) earned the tiebreaker and will play Orchard Lake St. Mary’s in the Prep Bowl.\nWarren Cousino 35, Grosse Pointe North 34: Ben Maleszyk hit Daniel Carnaghi with a TD pass with 1:41 left and Ryan Lux picked off a pass in the final minute to help Cousino (5-3, 4-1) grab a share of the MAC Blue title with North (4-4, 4-1). Now, Cousino needs a win at home against Marine City Friday to wrap up a playoff spot.\nMadison Heights Madison 56, St. Clair Shores South Lake 42: South Lake (7-1, 4-1) had a 42-40 lead and the ball with 2:39 left, but Madison’s Terrance Brown recovered a fumble, and Lance Mitchell took advantage by scoring his fifth TD of the game. Then, Brown scored on a 32-yard INT return with 1:27 left to make sure Madison (7-1, 5-0) earned its fourth consecutive MAC Silver title.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:56:42.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
