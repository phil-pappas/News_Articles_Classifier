I'm proud to coach them,\" MacIntyre said. \"They give everything they have and it hurts to look in their eyes after a game like that. I told them we all have to find a way to reach down in our soul and heart and mind and our sprit and find a way to keep taking another step. Advertisement \" \nThat's not going to be easy as the Buffs (3-4, 0-3 Pac-12) look ahead to the final six games of the season. \nFor months, the Buffs have talked openly about their hopes of finally getting to a bowl game this year. Saturday was a pivotal game to keep hope alive, and even they have to know that their postseason chances are extremely slim at this point. \nSince joining the Pac-12 in 2011, CU is 4-35 in conference games.

( Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer ) They are 1-28 in their last 29 Pac-12 games, with a pair of 14-game losing streaks - tied for the longest in school history - sandwiched around a lone win back in November of 2013 against California. \nTo get to a bowl game, the Buffs need to go 4-2 the rest of the way. \n\"That's a team of fighters,\" quarterback Sefo Liufau said. \"It sucks to lose, but we never quit and we'll come back ready to work tomorrow.\" \nMacIntyre sure hopes so, but admitted after the game that he worries about his players hanging their heads after this one. \n\"Yeah, you do,\" said MacIntyre, who dropped to 1-20 in his Pac-12 games. \"That's what I was telling them after the game: how much I appreciate them, how much I love them, how much I care for them. You're going to face some hard times in life. This is tough, when you're a young man, putting all your heart, soul and time into something, but you have to find a way to keep moving forward. If you just shut it down and stop and if you give in, you're going to give in later on in life. That's a lesson we're trying to teach them.\" \nMacIntyre's demeanor may have had more to do with protecting the psyche of his team than anything else, because they're all aware that this was a game that CU had to have. \nThe Buffs needed it for their confidence. They needed it for their fans and for the overall health of their program. They needed it, in essence, to save their season. \nThree quarters in, the Buffs looked poised to finally snap their nasty losing streak. Then, Arizona (5-2, 2-2) used its backup quarterback to hand CU a crushing defeat. \nCU led 24-17 late in the third and its defense had completely shut down the Arizona offense. \nArizona scored on each of its first three possessions to take a 17-7 lead in the first quarter, but CU got stops on eight straight possessions after that, forcing six punts, a fumble and a missed field goal. For the first time in nearly four years, the Buffs held a Pac-12 foe scoreless in consecutive quarters. \nWildcats head coach Rich Rodriguez then benched his starting quarterback, sophomore Anu Solomon, in favor of senior Jerrard Randall. \n\"We had to,\" Rodriguez said. \"We were off. Anu was off a little bit. We weren't executing well. The way they were playing us, we thought it fit Jerrard's skill-set a little bit, and help our run game get going.\" \nYeah, it helped. \nRandall led Arizona to 21 points with touchdowns on three consecutive possessions over a span of just over 11 minutes to turn CU's 24-17 lead into a 38-24 Arizona advantage. \n\"It definitely was a turning point and we had practiced for that,\" MacIntyre said of Randall getting into the game. \"He made some plays.\" \nHe did, but perhaps most back-breaking for CU was the fact that its own offense didn't make enough plays. \nAfter falling behind 17-7 early, CU did a nice job of rallying to take a 24-17 lead. \nLiufau, who threw for 339 yards and two touchdowns, also ran for two scores. His second running touchdown capped an eight-play, 75-yard drive to open the third quarter and give CU is first lead of the game. \nYet, while the CU defense kept coming up with stops, the CU offense couldn't add to its lead. \n\"If we could have got up maybe 31-17, it might have made a bigger difference,\" MacIntyre said. \"They might not have gone with a runner (at QB).\" \nAnother score could have forced Arizona to go to the air and stick with Solomon, who is the better passer of the two Wildcat quarterbacks. \nBy the time CU got that extra score, though - a 30-yard pass from Liufau to Shay Fields to make it 38-31 with 2:19 to play - it was too late. \n\"It's very frustrating,\" senior tackle Stephane Nembot said. \"We fought hard. We thought we were putting ourselves in a position to win the game and obviously it didn't happen. We have to practice hard and focus on the next one and keep pushing and keep fighting.\" \nTo this point, CU's push has been with a bowl game in mind. For now, the Buffs need to forget the bowl game and push simply to beat somebody in the Pac-12. \n\"I'm trying to hit every button I can to figure the answer out and I haven't figured that out yet,\" he said. \"Our kids are, too; they're trying to figure it out. We'll just keep fighting along and pushing at it. We're working on it every day. We feel like we're closer, we feel like we're getting nearer; we're just not there. \nIt's extremely frustrating for everybody.\" \nAfter most defeats, MacIntyre's frustration is evident in his face, his voice and his body language. Not this night. \nMacIntyre took a different tone after this one. No doubt his frustration was boiling inside, but publicly, he showered his team with love, in hopes that they'll stay on board as CU continues to search for victories. \n\"I hurt for my team. I hurt for those kids,\" MacIntyre said. \"I'm proud of how they always fight. I just really hurt for them. We have to find ways to get it done. \n\"Any time you go through something in life where you feel like you didn't achieve it, it hurts your gut. You remember (the pain) a little bit, but you just want to remember enough to keep you moving. Our kids will remember it, and we have to regroup and keep moving forward.\" \nContact staff writer Brian Howell at howellb@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/BrianHowell33.
