At issue is how he and his coaching staff manage that talent. \nIf we were keeping score with recruiting rankings, the Vols would be in the hunt for a spot in the playoffs. They’re great on paper. On the field? Not so much … especially when the game is on the line. Vols' slide continues in loss to Arkansas \nAs pressure has mounted, Jones has come off as a bit thin-skinned. He bristled at questions about his decision to kick the extra point when up by 12 in the Florida game even though conventional football wisdom holds that you go for two in that situation. \nLikewise, he seemed on edge last week when asked about the differences between coaching in the SEC and his previous stops in the Mid-American and Big East conferences. \n“The difference is the level of scrutiny,” he said. “Everyone second-guesses everything you do.” \nHe’s right, of course. But at $3.6 million a year, it’s part of the deal. Buy Photo \nCoach Butch Jones talks with his players during a break as Tennessee plays Arkansas on Oct. 3, 2015. (Photo: Larry McCormack / THE TENNESSEAN) \nOn top of that, the scrutiny is merited. Approaching the midway point of his third season at UT, Jones is 14-16 overall and 5-13 against SEC competition. With games against Georgia and Alabama upcoming, the Vols are staring 2-5 in the face. Jones may need another fast finish against the weak part of his schedule to secure a berth in a lower-tier bowl. \nIn many ways, Jones is a victim of the expectations he created via those recruiting classes. Fans get star struck by all those five- and four-star recruits. They don’t realize there is a mandatory waiting period for high school phenoms to come of age in the SEC. \nWith a handful of noteworthy exceptions, UT’s most talented players are sophomores and freshmen. That’s one of the reasons the Vols have experienced so many growing pains this season. \nThis UT team simply can’t close the deal. No lead is safe. In losses to Oklahoma and Florida, the Vols collapsed in the fourth quarter. They didn’t wait that long against Arkansas. An early 14-0 lead evaporated less than a minute into the second quarter. For UT's Butch Jones, losses never fade \nIt is telling that in the fourth quarters of those three losses, UT has been outgained in yardage 356-141 and outscored 28-7. Sixty-three of the Vols’ yards came on the completion of the long scoring drive that gave UT a 27-14 lead at Florida. \nAgainst Arkansas, the Vols faded badly in the second half. The defense couldn’t get off the field due to poor tackling. The Razorbacks ran 43 second-half plays to UT’s 26. \n“In the second half, we only had four possessions,” Jones said. “Our tackling wasn’t great.” \nAlso, UT’s running game evaporated in the second half against the Razorbacks. The Vols netted 4 yards on nine carries after halftime. \n“We knew it was going to be a line-of-scrimmage game and it showed,” Jones said. Butch Jones needs to drop script, think on his feet \nWhile fans can blame play-calling for the breakdown, the biggest culprit is an offensive line that simply isn’t up to SEC standards. The loss of senior guard Marcus Jackson in the preseason took a unit that already was the team’s weakest link and made it even weaker. \nDontavius Blair, a big-time junior college recruit in 2014, hasn’t panned out. Promising young linemen like Jack Jones, Drew Richmond and Charles Mosley haven’t been able to crack the starting lineup for one reason or another. \nThere’s no way to mask a suspect offensive line, especially against upper-crust defensive fronts in the SEC. \nMost rational fans — and there really are a few of you out there — recognized that UT was a year away from being a major player in the lukewarm SEC East. The program had been coached into the ground by Derek Dooley. Jones needed time to get things back up and running. \nHe’s made progress, but much work remains. \nBesides, it was a pretty lengthy honeymoon, wasn’t it? \nReach David Climer at 615-259-8020 and on Twitter @DavidClimer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:00:06.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
