Seems to happen every week, but especially this one – both in the Triangle and beyond. North Carolina and Pitt are headed straight towards a marquee matchup in primetime next Thursday night, but they’ll have to get over the hurdles of Virginia and Syracuse, respectively. \nThose seem like low bars, sure. But neither team has any reason to feel all that good about itself just yet. NC State has a golden chance to get its first ACC win of the season and get rid of the bad mojo. But they haven’t won at Wake Forest since the fall North Carolina began its 8-20 basketball season under Matt Doherty. That’s a long time. \nDuke’s risen a few spots in the top 25, but the Blue Devils are going to be facing a wounded Virginia Tech team that is better than it has played like half the season. The Coastal is in their hands, and they can’t afford to drop a game like this one. \nLouisville has looked competitive and steadily improving throughout ACC play, but watch all that goodwill melt away after a head-scratching loss to Boston College this weekend, should Louisville flub it. \nFlorida State will be facing a desperate Georgia Tech team that is probably not as bad as its record, but who can really say? The Seminoles are going to have their hands full. And then the league’s best playoff hope in Clemson will play a Miami team that only plays its best against the league’s best. Which is just lovely. \nSo, as I said… \nDon’t Screw It Up, everyone good in the ACC. \nNC STATE (4-2, 0-2 ACC) AT WAKE FOREST (3-4, 1-3 ACC) Time: 12:00 p.m. TV: RSN \n#ANALYSIS There’s no logical explanation why NC State rarely wins at Wake. It just doesn’t – at least, not since 2001. But if there’s ever a time to do it….it’s now. NC State really, really needs to feel good about itself, and Wake Forest is coming off of a 50-14 drubbing at North Carolina. The Deacs, who had played everyone tough this year, are probably not quite as ready to bounce back emotionally. NC State is coming off a bye and has been disappointing in its first two ACC games. But this team almost assuredly knows how badly it needs to win this game, too, and NC State can’t start pressing. It’s what has killed them early and often in ACC play. \nSo, if you’re NC State, get off to a good start….and MAINTAIN IT. And so NC State should do one thing first…get a lead a big one, preferably. Then, let Wake Forest score a touchdown. It’s a proven strategy that hasn’t failed yet in nine of Dave Clawson’s 12 ACC games. And if you’re Wake, basically let NC State score first and then come storming back at the end of the first half? Sure. No but Wake’s defense will have to do a much better job if it wants to have any semblance of success in this one. Dave Doeren and his staff no doubt tweaked a lot during NC State’s bye week. \nTHIS GUY Matt Dayes. Without Shadrach Thornton, NC State’s backfield is still plenty full, but Dayes has been the main guy. His production has dropped off since Thornton’s departure, which is probably more due to NC State’s strength of schedule going up but still noteworthy: he averaged 6.5 yards per touch (receiving and rushing) in NC State’s first four games and had nine touchdowns while he’s averaging 4.0 yards per touch in the last two (one touchdown). He’s still NC State’s workhorse back though, getting 33 carries over the last two weeks. He’s going to have to be the playmaker he was earlier in this season and most of last year as the freshmen and younger backs come along. Last year against Wake, Dayes had 66 yards rushing (and two scores) plus 47 yards receiving (and another score). \nHERE’S A GUY Brandon Chubb. His brother plays for NC State, which is a fact you’ll hear at least 15 times during the broadcast. But Wake’s senior linebacker is also really good at football. He doesn’t have a sack yet this season but he has 5.0 tackles for loss and three quarterback hurries, breaking up two passes as well. Against FSU, one reason it was a one-score game late at home is that he had a pass breakup and a quarterback hurry. He led Wake with 10 tackles against North Carolina last week as well. \nNARRATIVES \nNC State Win: There you go good feelings \nNC State Loss: You’re just one false move from falling into the abyss. \nWake Forest Win: Wait what really again but how \nWake Forest Loss: Wake Forest watching game film \nPREDICTION NC State, 33-20. Curses, shmurses. \nNO. 23 DUKE (5-1, 2-0 ACC) AT VIRGINIA TECH (3-4, 1-2 ACC) Time: 3:30 p.m. TV: ESPNU \n#ANALYSIS OK, Duke, you want to be big-time now…well, let’s see you win this game. By the power of transitive, if you want us to look at you as better than NC State, you had better. You’re ranked now, Duke. You’re not cute anymore. You’re SUPPOSED to win. But man are they dealing with a Virginia Tech team that is puzzling. They play Ohio State pretty well, pound Furman and Purdue and then have looked awful in three of their last four games, with NC State being the lone notable exception. \nLast year before beating Duke, the Hokies had lost three in a row. Duke’s defense is going to have to show up and be good, but it has been doing just that. This game will be at least in part on Duke’s offense hopefully having figured out something on its bye week to get going and be less pedestrian. Duke stretched the field more than it had against Boston College, but it’s still struggling to run the ball consistently and Virginia Tech’s defense is better than it has played. Duke’s offense is going to have to take chances and be aggressive. \nTHIS GUY Jeremy Cash. In games where you really need a win, turn to your best player. And Cash, Duke’s senior safety, is that for Duke – and one of the best in the league. It certainly wasn’t his fault that Duke lost to Virginia Tech last year, as Cash had seven tackles (3.0 for loss, 2.0 sacks) and a pass breakup. He has 10 of his 11.5 tackles for loss this season in the last four games alone, plus five of his seven quarterback pressures and three of his forced fumbles (two against Georgia Tech in a game where Duke needed it). Big players make big plays in big games, as the saying goes. \nHERE’S A GUY Michael Brewer. He’s back! Nothing to fear behind a bad o-line and no run game to support him, right? Brewer will get his first start since breaking his collarbone in VT’s season-opener in this one. And while the numbers weren’t a work of art, he did just enough last year against Duke, completing 12-of-23 passes for 138 yards, two touchdowns and one pick. He was sacked six times, but that was par for the course. Duke should really probably try to repeat this formula again against him. \nNARRATIVES Duke Win: Okay mildly pleased \nDuke Loss: What did I tell you about walking around blindly in the dark \nVirginia Tech Win: I don’t even know how to figure you out \nVirginia Tech Loss: This is for my Hokie fan people. You all are great and it’ll all be over soon. \nPREDICTION Duke, 23-19. Don’t stub your toe here, Duke. \nVIRGINIA (2-4) AT NORTH CAROLINA (5-1, 2-0) Time: 3:30 p.m. TV: RSN \n#ANALYSIS North Carolina has looked good, sure. But are they Virginia-tested? OK, recycling an old strength-of-schedule Louisville-NC State joke. And also, no team in their right mind would be Virginia-tested – except Virginia. For the Cavaliers, it’s going to come down to two things – running the ball, even if it’s not successful (because UNC defends the pass well) and playing well early. North Carolina has been getting out to somewhat slow starts lately, and Virginia will have to take advantage of that. \nThe Tar Heels can’t go into this one overconfident. It’s a cliché, and it’s vague, but it’s true. Virginia has been tested against a tough schedule and does have talent on its roster. And the Cavaliers are clearly still trying. North Carolina’s offense has been a juggernaut statistically, but they can’t have ill-timed turnovers or give Virginia any reason to think it’s still in the game. And against a Virginia offensive line that has been ravaged by injuries, they need to show they can rush the passer a bit better than they have. \nTHIS GUY T.J. Thorpe. Remember him? The former North Carolina wide receiver is now with Virginia, and while by all accounts his relationship with his former teammates is a good one, he’s going to have something to prove. He is already UVa’s third-leading receiver in just three games and is averaging 22.0 yards a catch; his ability to stretch the field is huge and if he can hit a big play or two, it would help UVa’s offense immeasurably. \nHERE’S A GUY Junior Gnonkonde. North Carolina doesn’t have a ton of sacks – just four on the season – but North Carolina’s junior defensive end has two of them, and both came last week against Wake Forest. He seems to be getting more and more comfortable, and North Carolina really needs to find a way to generate a pass rush against bad offensive lines the way it did last week. Virginia’s offensive line would certainly qualify, and Gnonkonde can be a difference maker. \nNARRATIVES \nVirginia Win: If you’re a Virginia fan is this good is this bad feelings are hard \nVirginia Loss: No one will blame you if you hit the showers early \nNorth Carolina Win: Hardly seemed like a fair fight \nNorth Carolina Loss: Oh my god UNC really \nPREDICTION North Carolina, 38-13. Think this game will end up being kind of gross. Bold prediction, I know. \nNO. 6 CLEMSON (6-0, 3-0 ACC) AT MIAMI (4-2, 1-1 ACC) Time: 12:00 p.m. TV: ABC \n#ANALYSIS Oh, I know what you’re going to do before you do it, Miami. You’re going to play the game of your lives against Clemson to try to ruin the ACC’s best hope at a playoff berth. Then you’re going to tank the rest of the season, even losing to Virginia again. Gross. You already embarrassed the ACC on national TV by losing to Cincinnati. Why must you continue to try to inflict damage? \nLook, Miami has some talent on offense, but a shaky offensive line that probably has Clemson’s excellent defense licking its chops. Miami’s defense is feast or famine – force a turnover or allow a big play, seemingly. Clemson QB Deshaun Watson has been a bit turnover-prone at times this season, and Miami could make him pay for that. But Clemson, ultimately, is the better team. \n(PS: If this were a night game I would totally pick Miami.) \nNARRATIVES \nClemson Win: Whew that was close \nClemson Loss: That seems bad is Clemson ok probably not \nMiami Win: John Swofford to Miami: \nMiami Loss: Stay mad, Miami banner airplane people \nPREDICTION Clemson, 44-37. Oh, Miami. So close. \nNO. 25 PITTSBURGH (5-1, 3-0 ACC) AT SYRACUSE (3-3, 1-1 ACC) Time: 12:00 p.m. TV: ESPNU \n#ANALYSIS Pitt, I do actually want to love you, believe it or not. You don’t even look like the same team from a year ago. Syracuse….really? Losses at USF and at Virginia? I don’t care if you have Tyler Ennis at quarterback, you are disappoint. I have no idea what to make of Syracuse, since the team I saw push LSU at home waved bye bye seemingly a long time ago. \nI want to trust you, Pitt, and not just because you’ve won nine of the last 10 in this series. It’s just, like, a general thing. Get to next week’s Thursday night game against North Carolina without an embarrassing blemish on your record. You are better than Syracuse right now on both sides of the ball. Unless Scott Shafer is especially angry over Pat Narduzzi poisoning him with kiwi all those many years ago, you should do just that. And even then. Like, just wave a kiwi at him. \nNARRATIVES \nPittsburgh Win: Grr, baby. \nPittsburgh Loss: You did what now \nSyracuse Win: You lose to USF and UVa and then beat Coastal favorite Pitt ok what \nSyracuse Loss: Well you are just sad \nPREDICTION \nBOSTON COLLEGE (3-4, 0-4 ACC) AT LOUISVILLE (2-4, 1-2 ACC) Time: 12:30 p.m. TV: ACC Network \n#ANALYSIS No offense, but…no, that’s the joke. Boston College has no offense. And Louisville’s defense has some talent. Don’t let what FSU was able to do fool you; Louisville held them to six points at half. Boston College managed just 246 yards of total offense last week and actually had MORE yards per play (4.03) than it did the previous week when it lost 3-0 to Wake Forest (3.65). Louisville is going to have a tough time running the ball on Boston College’s stout defense, which will likely leave it to talented freshman quarterback Lamar Jackson to make plays with his legs and arm. He’s done that all up until last week when FSU managed to contain him and make him a passer. He was good at that, but Louisville’s at its best when he can exploit the defense doing both. It’ll be up to the freshman and that steadily-improving offense to solve the BC defense riddle. \nNARRATIVES \nBoston College Win: Fun in a retro kind of way \nBoston College Loss: Exclusive footage of Boston College’s offense \nLouisville Win: Hey you won a winnable game good for you \nLouisville Loss: Been a rough week for Louisville just, like, in general. \nPREDICTION Louisville, 23-16. Avert your eyes. \nNO. 9 FLORIDA STATE (6-0, 4-0 ACC) AT GEORGIA TECH (2-5, 0-4 ACC) Time: 7:00 p.m. TV: ESPN2 \n#ANALYSIS Georgia Tech is like a wounded animal. Which either means it will die on the side of the road without its dignity or it will fight like crazy and claw your eyes out, then steal your keys and escape its confines, only to wreak mass havoc in the city. It seems illogical to think Georgia Tech is going to look all that different from the team we’ve seen all year. Is Florida State going to keep not turning it over on offense? Probably not, but Everett Golson looks much more comfortable in Jimbo Fisher’s offense than he ever did at Notre Dame and it’s hard to imagine Georgia Tech’s offensive line getting suddenly a ton better overnight. \nNARRATIVES \nFlorida State Win: You narrowly avoided disaster \nFlorida State Loss: The ACC can’t afford for you to have a rebuilding year stop it \nGeorgia Tech Win: Caged animal attacks \nGeorgia Tech Loss: Caged animal is resigned to his fate \nPREDICTION Florida State, 38-27. Georgia Tech will make this interesting, of course. \nOverall: 54-14 (15-5 ACC) Last Week: 6-0 (6-0 ACC) \nCopyright 2015 by Capitol Broadcasting Company. All rights reserved.
