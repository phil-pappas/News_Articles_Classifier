The offence and the defence also returned intact. While other teams integrated new members, the Raptors’ starting five picked up right where they left off. \nNo one can say for sure what will happen this year, but the expectation is for more growing pains than there were a year ago. \nDwane Casey is not one to overstate progress, but he, for one, is pretty convinced the work is just beginning for this club. \n“I like the way our defensive progress is going, we’re not there yet,” Casey said Saturday following the final official training camp workout. “We made some big steps this week with our changes and things we want to work on. \n“We’re not there offensively, I think that’s going to come but I like where we are in our camp.” \nThe focus all week has been almost 100% defence and, based on the slippage a year ago in that department and the role it played in that disappointing four-game sweep at the hands of the Washington Wizards last season, it’s completely understandable. \nIn the long run though, Casey is convinced the gradual grow will pay dividends. \n“It’s a different approach,” Casey said. “I think right now, we understand there’s so much we have to get done and learn and get up to speed with. Last year, it was a little bit easier because of the familiarity. \n“I liked last year’s team, but this year’s team I think we can do more with it offensively and defensively with the experience of guys like DeMarre (Carroll), playing him at the four, playing him at the three, playing him at the two, he’s guarding ones. It gives us a lot of flexibility from that standpoint.“ \nMore than anything, the Carroll addition puts everyone back where they they should be. \nCasey readily admits he asked a lot of both DeMar DeRozan and Terrence Ross in the absence of a guy who could legitimately match up with the more physical threes in the league and asking them to defend those guys. There really is no good match for a LeBron James, but Paul Pierce or Joe Johnson have given the Raptors fits in the past as DeRozan and Ross are asked to basically defend above their weight classes. \nCarroll allows DeRozan to go back to defending similar-sized shooting guards and he allows Ross to go back to the bench and bring both a defensive presence into that second unit, not to mention his ability from behind the three-point line. \n“It was tough, especially guarding those big guys, for me and T a lot of times,” DeRozan admitted. “I like to play against the twos. A lot of times the physicality of the threes, when I’m used to going against the twos, and some nights I might have Jeff Green, Paul Pierce, Joe Johnson, stuff like that. I couldn’t really be as physical as I would be any other night. It definitely takes its toll. That’s what you work on during the summer for. But now I’ve got DeMarre, so I don’t have to worry about it.” \nRebounding, another weakness with this team a year ago should also improve, but some of that is going to have to come from improvement from within that group that is returning. \nBismack Biyombo alone will improve numbers, but he’s going to be coming off the bench behind Jonas Valanciunas. \nThrough camp, Biyombo has been one of Casey’s better rebounders and certainly his most talkative presence defensively. \n“Today was one of our better days, one because we did a better job of rebounding,” Casey said. “If we have one thing we’ve got to think about it’s our rebounding, we’re getting stops but we’ve to do the dirty work at the end and rebound. We did abetter job today, but it’s an area of concern.” \nCasey wants to see more and reading between the lines, he wants more from his starting bigs. \n“Biyombo’s one of our rebounders, but I tell you, some of our guards are leading us in rebounding, which is not good,” Casey said. “Kyle (Lowry) and DeMar coming in, T-Ross is rebounding better, DeMarre is one of our better rebounders, (Luis) Scola does it by position, but we can get much better. We’ve got to get much better.” \nAgain, there has been progress for the Raptors this week, but the work is just beginning. \nA repeat of that 22-6 start from a year ago is probably not in the cards. \nDEROZAN GETTING VOCAL \nBURNABY, B.C. — DeMar DeRozan has always done what is necessary to give his team the best chance to win. \nWhether that’s an off-season regimen that starts almost as soon as the season ends and continues until the next one begins or taking on defensive assignments well beyond his weight class, DeRozan has answered the bell. \nOne area DeRozan was not always comfortable though was in the role of vocal leader. He would lead by example, no problem, but verbally calling out teammates or holding them accountable after the fact was a role he shied away from. \nThat is no longer the case. \n“I’m just trying to take more of a leadership role and help this team win,” DeRozan said. “I feel like I’ve been there in a lot of situations now, to where I can speak up and say stuff to get on somebody or get somebody going. I definitely feel more comfortable doing that.” \nThere was a day when DeRozan would have to force himself to do that, but that too is no longer the case. \n“Nah, nah, that’s easy now,” DeRozan said. “I tell myself to shut up sometimes. It’s been going good.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T05:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T05:56:38.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
