Landon Bjorge caught an eight-yard scoring pass from Braden Backowski and Wyatt Nelson’s kick made it 7-0. \n“I’m proud of our boys,” Little Falls head coach Joe Bartos said. “They played their butts off. \n“They gave a perfect effort and they’re great young men. I’m proud to be their football coach.” \nThings got going for Rocori (6-3) with two second-quarter touchdowns. Their 13-7 lead turned into a 27-7 advantage in the third quarter. \nAnd that was enough to send the third-seeded Spartans into the section semifinals. They play at 6 p.m. Saturday at second-seeded Detroit Lakes (7-1). \n“We definitely did good in the second half,” said Rocori senior linebacker Ryan Vigil. “We had some turnovers and we we got two touchdowns.” \nGunnar Feldhege picked off an errant Flyer pass and the Spartans’ offense took over on the Little Falls 21. Five plays later, Schoborg found Nick Skluzacek in the end zone for a 9-yard TD. \nThe Spartans then forced another turnover. Dominic Theis recovered a fumble after a hard hit by Ethan Braun. Rocori’s drive stalled in the red zone, but it gave the Spartans good field position when the Flyers were forced to punt. \nOn their next possession, Tommy Wieber scored on a three-yard TD run and Rocori had a 20-point lead.

Nick Warne had 20 carries for 98 yards and a touchdown. Schoborg completed 17 of 31 passes for 202 yards and two TDs. \nOne touchdown was a 50-yarder to Alec Anderson. The other was to Skluzacek. \nFor Little Falls, Bjorge wound up with eight receptions for 81 yards and two TDs. \n“Solid,” was Bartos’ description of the Spartans. “They’re a decent football team and very classy. \n“They should be very tough the rest of the playoffs. \nFirst quarter \nLF — Landon Bjorge 8 pass from Braden Backowski (Wyatt Nelson kick) \nSecond quarter \nR — Alec Anderson 50 pass from Connor Schoborg (Nick Skluzacek kick) \nR — Nick Warne 12 run (Skluzacek kick) \nThird quarter \nR — Skluzacek 9 pass from Schoborg (Skluzacek kick) \nR — Tommy Wieber 3 run (Skluzacek kick) \nLF — Bjorge 16 pass from Backowski (Nelson kick) \nFourth quarter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:41:53.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
