That must change.\nTake the seventh inning on Saturday, as the Kansas City Royals chipped away relentlessly at David Price and his three-run lead. This after the unfortunate leadoff flyball that landed in short right field, the one Ryan Goins and Jose Bautista seemed to handle like a CFL punt, scrambling to avoid no-yards. That play opened the door, but Price allowed the Royals to barge into the lead. He had retired 18 straight.\nAfter an ensuing line drive through a spot that would normally have been where Chris Colabello was positioned if he had not been holding Ben Zobrist on first, the big inning gained momentum. Even with Price still on a reasonable pitch count — but with thoughts of his bad luck in the playoffs dancing in his head with six straight losses as a starter — it was time to have a couple of relievers up, Liam Hendriks or Mark Lowe plus Aaron Loup.\nInstead, Price continued to grind. In an inning that seemed to take forever, with Price throwing 37 pitches to record two outs, and in an inning that had him exit with a runner on second base, trailing 4-3, it was Sanchez who entered, allowing a base hit to drive in the final run credited to Price. Only then, after the Jays lost the lead and trailed 5-3, did Loup and Lowe enter the defeat.\nFor his part, Price saw his record drop to 0-7 as a playoff starter, tying an MLB record set by Hall of Famer Randy Johnson.\nIn the post-season, seven Toronto relievers — minus the three innings logged by Price in Game 4 of the ALDS — have combined to allow five earned runs and 12 hits in 20.0 innings for a 2.25 ERA. Ryan Tepera has not made an appearance as the roster replacement for Cecil. Those are not bad numbers.\nBut it’s the situations. Of the 11 appearances by the Jays’ secondary guys — Lowe, Loup, Hendriks and LaTroy Hawkins — four of those came in extra innings with the score tied in an eventual ALDS Game 2 loss. Five of them have been with the Jays trailing by two or more runs. Only two relief appearances by that group came with the Jays in the lead — Loup and Lowe, each for an out, leading 5-1. Hendriks, in particular, deserves the attention and higher leverage situations. He has made one playoff appearance.\nAt some point in this post-season, if the Jays are going to come back and complete what they started, manager John Gibbons is going to have to show more faith in his secondary relievers and ride them. Keep the faith . . . they’re part of what got you here. We’re always reminded baseball is a game of failure, so after a failure, big or small, the manager needs to forgive, believe again and move on.\nIt’s tough for Gibbons, because there are also only two starting pitchers he currently has faith in. They are Monday’s Game 3 starter, Marcus Stroman, and Game 1 starter, Marco Estrada. At that point, the numbers don’t add up if Sanchez is the eighth-inning man and Osuna the ninth. In seven post-season games, Jay starters are averaging 6 1/3 innings. There are more outs needed; use and trust the ’pen.\nAs for his starters, at various times during the regular season Gibbons lost faith in Drew Hutchison (13-5, 5.57) and Mark Buehrle (15-8, 3.81). During the playoffs, he used Price in relief in Game 4 rather than start him in Game 5. And that dovetails with the fact he took R.A. Dickey out of that same Game 4 eventual victory, just one out shy of earning the win. The reason cited was that a three-run Shin-Soo Choo homer would have made it a three-run lead. Dickey was at just 78 pitches.\nThe Jays have to win eight more games to win the World Series. Price pitched like an ace for six innings in Game 2. The Jays can only win if Price is an ace for his next three starts, assuming they can advance. But Gibbons needs to believe in all of his pitchers. Dickey has won a Cy Young Award and is 8-1 since the all-star break. He will also need to come up big.\nMost teams have one, some have two aces they count on in big games, entering with the belief they will win. They don’t always, but you need to build a playoff rotation around those guys. The Mets have Matt Harvey, Jacob deGrom and Noah Syndergaard. The Cubs have Jake Arrieta and Jon Lester. The Royals have Johnny Cueto who, even though he has struggled, remains at the top of manager Ned Yost’s playoff rotation.\nThe Jays can come back from two games down, but patience and faith from the manager in all his pitchers that performed in the regular season is required.\nMore on thestar.com\nTiger-Cats top Alouettes, clinch spot in CFL playoffs\nBlue Jays' last chances are on deck in ALCS: Arthur", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:39:24.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
