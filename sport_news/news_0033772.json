Texas won, 24-17. (Brandon Wade/Fort Worth Star-Telegram/TNS) By John ShinnThe Norman (Okla.) Transcript \nOklahoma did not play with a physical edge against Texas. There are debatable reasons for why that occurred. Multiple players stated that the team was “flat.” Coach Bob Stoops said it was a matter of execution. Texas was better. \nIn terms of routine, practices haven’t changed. Focus is what needs alteration. \n“It’s just like muscle memory. If you practice aggressive and you practice throughout the entire week aggressive, then you’re going to go into the game and feel like you’re the aggressor and you can just bully everyone,” cornerback Jordan Thomas said. “When it comes to just being the aggressor, you’ve just got to practice like that.” \nWhether that means more hitting in practice is up to Stoops. He has to walk the fine line between sharpening the physical edge in practice and still being as healthy as possible for games. \nSounds like players wouldn’t mind some rougher practices. \n“That last game showed how much more physical we can be, and how much more physical we need to be going into this stretch of games,” running back Samaje Perine said. “Once we go into full pads Tuesdays and upper levels Wednesdays we’re going to have to do a great job of being physical. As a team, offensively, we’re not physical enough. We have to really emphasize that this week.” \nStill Waiting On Bond \nDefensive coordinator Mike Stoops said Wednesday’s practice will be critical in whether outside linebacker Devante Bond will be able to play against Kansas State. \nBond was held out of the Texas game due an ankle injury he suffered a week earlier against West Virginia. P.L. Lindley, who started against Texas, has worked with the first team in Monday’s and Tuesday’s practices. \n“Devante’s one of our best players. I don’t think there’s any question about that. We certainly missed him. We’ll see where he’s at here tomorrow, but P.L. has been a steady player for us,” Stoops said. “P.L. didn’t hurt us the other night. He did a lot of good things. If he has to play, we feel very confident in him as a player, but Devante’s a playmaker, you know what I mean? Those are guys that you need.” \nRoad Is Kind \nThe road team has won the last four meetings between OU and Kansas State. Wide receiver Sterling Shepard gave a one-word answer for why that’s been the case. \n“Coincidence,” he said. \nThere hasn’t been a rationale for it. OU won 41-31 in its 2013 game at Kansas State. The Sooners were an underdog with Trevor Knight starting in place of Blake Bell. Last season, the Wildcats upset OU with a 31-30 victory. \nThe last time the home team won an OU-Kansas State game was the Sooners’ 42-30 victory in 2009. \nBring The Blitz \nTexas’ blitz-heavy scheme rattled OU. That likely provided a blueprint for what most defenses will do until the Sooners show they can handle it. \nOffensive coordinator Lincoln Riley hopes that’s the case. \n“If you had us pick, we’d rather you blitz us,” he said. “There were a lot of holes and a lot of opportunities that when we’re operating at a high level, we feel like we can take advantage of. We didn’t. Just like West Virginia. If you are decisive and attack them and are sharp, you can make them pay. We did that with a lot of big plays against West Virginia. We did not do a good enough job of making Texas pay.” \nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T09:07:59.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
