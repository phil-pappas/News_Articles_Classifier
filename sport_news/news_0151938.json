I think it comes too late — to come after 15 years is too late.\n“It should happen after two, three or four, but it is something that is helping me to be better. Not the hardest challenge, no, just the worst results.”\nThe Portuguese also refused to come down too harshly on his players — and in the process took a swipe at the media.\n“Players know when they make mistakes. I don't know what it's like in your offices, but nobody seems to care about your mistakes,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, ahead of the visit of Southampton to Stamford Bridge on Saturday, he confirmed that he will have a full squad to work with, save injured goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, while he hinted there could once again be changes in his starting XI.\n“My assistant reported that [Loic] Remy, Oscar and [Radamel] Falcao trained fantastically well when the squad was in Porto,” the former Real Madrid boss reported, having omitted the trio from his traveling party.\nSince the Premier League began in 1992-93, Chelsea has only once picked up fewer points in its opening seven matches.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:38:18.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
