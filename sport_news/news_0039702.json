Luke Freeman's shot from long range was inches wide and Kodjia had a volley deflected for a corner as City continued to look the more dangerous side. \nKodjia's direct running often had the visitors in trouble, while Freeman and Korey Smith were energetic forces for the hosts in midfield. \nForest's attack lacked a quality final ball and most of their first-half efforts came from distance. Lansbury failed to trouble Fielding from 30 yards, but the visitors were gaining a greater share of possession as half-time approached. \nForest began the second half brightly, with Daniel Pinillos and Lansbury shooting wide from outside the box. City had a narrower escape on 57 minutes when a poor clearance fell to the impressive Lansbury, whose volley from the edge of the box hit the angle of post and crossbar. \nWilbraham went close to a hat-trick when volleying over on 65 minutes. At the other end Forest substitute Jamie Ward saw his angled drive pushed wide of his near post by Fielding. \nDe Vries kept the visitors in the game with outstanding saves from Kodjia, Luke Ayling and Wilbraham twice as City looked to press home their advantage. The home fans cheered their team to victory in the dying minutes and gave them a standing ovation at the end. \n\"We never deserved to be bottom of the table because we have played like that in other games this season and been punished for errors,\" Cotterill said after the game. \n\"Looking at the table over the last fortnight has made us angry, rather than despondent, and tonight brought the reaction I expected. \n\"It was a really good team performance. I have a great group of lads who give everything and enjoy the way we play, but we are still adapting to Championship football. \nLast season's League One champions have taken a while to adjust to the higher level, but on this evidence are capable of climbing the table quickly.
