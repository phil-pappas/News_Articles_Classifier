John Scruggs and Lt. Eric Shober posed during a sparsely-attended community forum Monday night in Southwest Portland.\nPortland Police Chief Larry O'Dea Portland Police Chief Larry O'Dea\nPortland's mayor and police chief and other police brass are working on drafting a policy for use of body-worn cameras by November. The bureau would like to request bids from vendors in November or December, and purchase cameras in January to begin to equip about 600 patrols officers and sergeants next spring.\n\"We want to get this right,'' Chief Larry O'Dea said.\nPolice said they want to build a policy based upon input from residents, and hope the use of the cameras will improve the community's trust in police.\n\"Body cameras are a tool to keep the truth safe,'' Hales said.\nState lawmakers last session approved a bill that set some basic guidelines for law enforcement agencies that choose to equip their officers with the body-worn cameras. The law sets general standards governing camera use, retention of the recordings and access to footage.\nUnder the new state guidelines, when an officer has reasonable suspicion or probable cause that a crime has occurred or is about to occur, they can film an encounter, Scruggs said. Police would be obligated to retain the footage for a minimum of 180 days.\nThe Police Bureau is leaning toward giving officers discretion on when to turn the cameras off and on, with specific guidelines. The camera batteries last four to six hours, police supervisors said.\nFor example, members of the National Alliance on Mental Illness told police they favored officers filming their encounters and responses to people who are suffering a mental crisis, Scruggs said. Yet, once a person with a mental illness is stabilized and secure, there was consensus that the filming would be halted, Scruggs said.\nOfficers also are leaning toward not allowing video to roll inside a medical facility where a patient's privacy could be violated, or during interviews of a reluctant witness, or inside a private home when a suspect is no longer present.\nPolice brass noted that many departments allow officers to review their body-camera footage before writing incidents reports. Reaction was mixed Monday night.\nDan Handelman, of the police watchdog group Copwatch, urged against allowing officers at any time to view the camera videos before writing incident reports. He also urged the bureau not to allow officers who use deadly force to review the videos before they're interviewed by an investigator.\nSuzanne Hayden, of the Citizens Crime Commission, however, said she'd favor allowing officers to view the camera footage before writing their incident reports on arrests, saying the video \"can refresh their memory'' and save them time.\nThe cameras range from $800 to 1200 each. Outfitting the estimated 500 officers and 100 sergeants on patrol would cost the bureau at least half a million dollars, Scruggs said.\nThe Police Bureau plans to use $834,619 that the council already approved for in-car video cameras to equip uniformed officers and sergeants with body cameras instead.\nTraffic officers have been testing out cameras from different vendors. One vendor has a camera that automatically turns the camera on when an officer removes their gun from a holster, or when there's a sound of gunfire.\nAnother forum will be held Wednesday night from 6 to 8 p.m. at The Rosewood Initiative Community Center, 16126 S.E. Stark St.\nWritten comments can also be submitted to the police bureau on their website .\n-- Maxine Bernstein\nmbernstein@oregonian.com\n503-221-8212\n@maxoregonian", "external_links": ["https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/index.cfm?&a=521411", "https://twitter.com/maxoregonian"], "published": "2015-10-20T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:48:17.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
