And the plan he has for the organization's future, though still in its early stages, is in full swing.\nMore coverage VOTE: Will the Flyers make the playoffs?

Latest hockey odds Perhaps the plan could be expedited without a hard salary cap. But the cap exists. So contracts such as MacDonald's and Vincent Lecavalier's - wasted money if neither contributes on the ice - make the process a little longer.\n\"The salary cap is hard,\" Hextall said in an interview with the Daily News . \"There's no way around it, so you've got to stay within it. You always have to be cognizant of it. I can't sit behind my desk and look at this year, or just this year and next year. I've got to look two, three, four years. As hard as it is to project where the salary cap's going to be and what you're going to have to pay certain players, I don't want to get into a position where we're forced to trade a young player. So you just have to constantly be on top of it.\n\"You have to constantly be monitoring where you're at, where you think you're going to be at in one year, two years, three years. There's guys you've got to look at and say, 'OK, in three years, this guy is up, or these four guys are up.' And we better have some space. So you can't make moves to help you - sign a guy to a long-term deal that might help you for a year or two, it's going to hurt you in three or four years. We're just not going to do that.\"\nBeing a general manager in the pre-cap era must have been somewhat easier.\n\"It's a lot more complex than it was years ago,\" Hextall said. \"It's probably always been a hard job, but I think the details and stuff nowadays with the rules, yeah. But it's fun, it's challenging, and I love a challenge.\"\nIt's a challenge his predecessors either didn't have to deal with or didn't fully embrace. The Flyers have always been a \"win-now\" type of team. They made offseason moves to push the envelope toward winning another Stanley Cup, one that's eluded them for 40 years.\nBut, to their credit, they've always tried to put a winner on the ice, whether the decisions they made turned out to be successful or not. There's admiration in that. When Paul Holmgren went out and signed Ilya Bryzgalov to a huge contract, it showed the Flyers were fully invested in bringing a franchise goaltender to an organization that desperately needed one. It turned out wrong. It happens.\nHe went out and traded for MacDonald, giving up two draft picks in the process. He then signed MacDonald to a six-year, $30 million contract last April, a few weeks before losing his job. The deal, which was questioned by many, was an effort to lock up a defenseman he thought could help the team win. Holmgren ended up being wrong.\nAnd because of that - and some other deals - the Flyers are stuck in relative salary-cap hell, for lack of a better term.\nThe pieces are there for the future, however. The top-line combo of Jake Voracek and Claude Giroux are signed through 2022 and 2024, respectively. Twenty-two-year-old center Sean Couturier is under contract through 2022, as well.\nProvorov and Konecny - both drafted in this year's first round - look as if they could potentially prove to be good draft picks. Sanheim, Samuel Morin, Shayne Gostisbehere and Robert Hagg could be potential mainstays on the blue line. In the past, the Flyers were quick to trade prospects in an effort to expedite winning.\nHextall seems willing to wait as long as necessary to get to a point at which the Flyers are built to contend for a Cup. But, even in saying that, he's shed some cap weight as recently as this offseason, in trading Nicklas Grossmann and the contract of Chris Pronger. When he traded Scott Hartnell last offseason, he was met with criticism, but there was a reason: to be more financially sound one year sooner. Trading Zac Rinaldo for a third-round pick this past offseason has been lauded. By all accounts, Hextall is doing things the right way, being patient when necessary.\nSo how is chairman Ed Snider, who desperately wants to win another Stanley Cup in this town, handling this slower, calculated approach?\n\"Everybody questions that, but he's been absolutely phenomenal,\" Hextall said of Snider. \"He understands where we're going. He also knows that we have a better team than most people think we have. We're excited about this year. And I think, when you're excited about this year and you're excited about the future, your organization is in a good place. I believe we're in a good place right now. Are we where we want to be? No, we're not. But we're in a good place, and we're excited about this year.\"\nHextall said he can lean on some of his experience in Los Angeles to help guide the future. He left the Flyers organization in 2006 to join Dean Lombardi's staff in LA and helped rebuild the Kings from one of the league's worst teams into a Stanley Cup champion. They did it largely from within. Anze Kopitar, Drew Doughty, Dustin Brown and Jonathan Quick - among others - were all homegrown talents who were fixtures on the cup-winning Kings teams.\nOf course, there were players such as Mike Richards and Jeff Carter added via trades who also helped, but most of the success came from drafting and developing talent.\nIt helps when you draft right, something the Flyers haven't had an abundance of success with. But they've seemed to turn the corner in that department, starting with Holmgren's 2012 draft, which resulted in Gostisbehere, Scott Laughton and Anthony Stolarz.\nThe process isn't exactly fast, but it's the way Hextall wants to do it. In a cap world, he has little choice. At some point, he'll have to combine the salaries of his top players with some young, cheap talent. Winning teams have a good balance of both. The Blackhawks, with the huge salaries of Jonathan Toews, Patrick Kane, Marian Hossa, Brent Seabrook and Duncan Keith, seem to find ways every season to mix and match top, expensive talent with younger, cheaper talent.\n\"I think the emphasis on drafting and developing is not going to go away,\" Hextall said. \"Because, even when we get to the point where we're a top team, we still have to continue to draft and develop. Are we going to have as many picks? No. But you still have to have an emphasis on drafting and developing. You have to draft players that are going to play in the NHL, and not just your first-rounders.\n\"You need players to come in and be at a reasonable (cap) number, at least for three or four years, where they really help balance your cap out before you have to pay them the big money. So you've got to keep players coming from below, continually. That can't stop.\"\nSo when will the rebuild stop and when can the Flyers count on contending for a Cup? Just a few years?\n\"We're getting ahead of ourselves there,\" Hextall said. \"We've got a lot of work to do as a team, as a staff, as a coaching staff. We've got a lot of work to do.\n\"I've always been a guy that doesn't like to talk about things. I'd rather let them just do the work and let them play out. We have a lot of work to do. We know that. That's not a bad thing, it's a good thing. We've got a good team on the ice right now but we've got some kids coming that we've got to develop the right way.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=article&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2FNHL_Philadelphia_Flyers"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:29:48.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
