It's not going to happen overnight. \n\"It ain't an easy job this but it's one I love and one I'm not going to give up very easily.\" \nSherwood joked he will avoid a call from the board if it wants to sack him. \n\"I'll just turn my phone off,\" he said. \nSherwood admitted, though, his players are lacking confidence after they failed to build on Ayew's second-half opener before sinking to a killer blow. \nHe said: \"We can't do any more as coaches and managers. We're working as hard as we possibly can and the players can't do more regarding effort. They can only give us what they can give us. We can't turn them into superstars. \n\"It was a toss-of-the-coin game. That's how close it was and that's how close all of our games have been.\" \nSwansea were winless in six games ahead of their Villa Park trip and boss Garry Monk insisted he ignored any hype surrounding their slump this week. \nHe said: \"It's a case of knowing what these players are capable of. I don't focus on the circus which goes on outside. I make the players focus on football. \n\"You win and lose games no matter what. It's the nature of the sport we're in. It's important we reach our standards. It was never going to be easy because of the circus which has gone on this week. \n\"In terms of the criticism I was receiving myself, you feel for Tim. He is an excellent coach and manager and no-one will be working harder than him to put it right.\" \nThere was a flare-up in the tunnel at the end of the game as tempers boiled over following a clash between Micah Richards and Federico Fernandez in the first half, but Monk played it down. \nHe added: \"The boys came in and they were fine. Everyone was talking about the game.\" \nSherwood felt the Swansea defender should have been sent off after the clash during the game, though. \n\"The ref has got to send him off if he sees it,\" the Villa boss said. \"He (Fernandez) stuck his head in.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:22:22.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
