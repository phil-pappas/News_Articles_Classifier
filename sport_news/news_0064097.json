Krsunthia Brooks Childs, 40, died from lupus earlier this week. Williams said Brooks will be back for the Oct. 18 game against the Baltimore Ravens. The San Francisco 49ers' Aaron Lynch (59) pressures the Green Bay Packers' Aaron Rodgers (12) in second quarter of their NFL game at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., on Sunday, Oct. 4, 2015. (Dan Honda/Bay Area News Group) ( Dan Honda ) \nThat leaves Lynch, rookie Eli Harold and third-year veteran Corey Lemonier to primarily handle the pass-rushing chores against Manning, who had five passes intercepted and got sacked twice in the 49ers' victorious visit last Nov. 16, a 16-10 win. \n\"Ahmad, to other teams, is one of those veterans they come into games strategizing against,\" Lynch said. \"Their strategy may change. It won't necessarily change anything we do.\" \nBrooks has started every game he has played since 2011. His only sack this season came in Sunday's 17-3 loss to the Green Bay Packers. \nLynch's showing in 20 career games has caught the Giants' attention, and most recently Aaron Rodgers' on Sunday. Lynch sacked Rodgers twice, raising his team-high total to three this season. Advertisement \n\"You see 59 (Lynch's number) showing up some, getting some sacks, and he's playing pretty good football,\" Manning said on a recent conference call with Bay Area media. \nLynch has nine sacks in his past 14 games, including six as a rookie upon being drafted in the fifth round from South Florida. Could he be the 49ers' pass-rushing replacement for Aldon Smith, who excelled in 2011 and 2012 before eventual off-field woes led to his Aug. 7 release? \n\"Pass rushing is what I like to do. I have fun doing it,\" Lynch said. \"They're giving me a lot of opportunities to do it.\" \nLynch's nasty streak on the field might be the most noticeable among the 49ers. \n\"He's a different cat,\" safety Eric Reid said. \"He's exciting to be around. He gets the job done.\" \nLynch enjoyed his last task of trying to chase down Rodgers. When he narrowly missed a second-quarter sack, Lynch joked with Rodgers about it, in a non-trash-talking manner. \n\"I was telling him, 'Hey, let me eat. Let me get some sacks. You keep throwing the ball away when I'm getting there,' \" Lynch said. \"He joked back, 'I can't let you do that.' That was kind of cool to talk to a guy like that. \n\"Then I sacked him and talked a little junk to him.\" \nHarold, a third-round pick from Virginia, nearly registered his first career sack Sunday against Rodgers, only to miss out after that fourth-quarter stunt. \n\"I was a little out of control. I came so free and my eyes got so big,\" Harold said. \"I was like, 'I'm about to sack one of the best guys in the league.' A snap of a finger, he just broke the tackle. \n\"I've just got to learn to play fast and under control.\" \nIf Harold doesn't start opposite Lynch, it probably will be Lemonier, whose only career sack came two years ago. The 49ers also could deploy a package in which only one outside linebacker is used while defensive back Jaquiski Tartt or Keith Reaser joins the mix. \nLeft tackle Joe Staley, for a second consecutive day, rode a stationary bike in the weight room rather than practice because of Sunday's knee injury. Staley has started 68 consecutive regular-season games, the fourth-longest active streak among offensive tackles. \nIf Staley can not play Sunday night, the 49ers' options could include shifting Alex Boone from left guard, or perhaps they summon Trent Brown and Brandon Thomas to make their respective NFL debuts. \nThe 49ers' beleaguered offense will have a new look, although coordinator Geep Chryst wouldn't say if that's personnel or scheme related. \n\"We made some major changes. I shouldn't say major. We made some adjustments that we feel good about going into this game,\" Chryst said. \"But it would be disingenuous for me to elaborate on it, and then we go out to the game and it's a clunker.\" \nThe 49ers (1-3) have the league's lowest-ranked pass offense, and Colin Kaepernick ranks 32nd in passer rating amid a three-game losing streak. \"You have to go under the hood and correct things, tweak the engine so it runs a little more smoothly,\" Chryst added. \nBecause the 49ers aren't changing quarterbacks and promoting Blaine Gabbert, other potential changes are on the offensive line and perhaps at the No. 3 receiver spot, with Bruce Ellington taking over for a concussion-suffering Quinton Patton. \nReturning to practice were Boone (ankle), Patton (concussion) and linebacker NaVorro Bowman (rest).
