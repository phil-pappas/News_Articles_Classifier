More From KTVZ.COM 'Laces out, Dan!': Prince Harry... \nThompson did not sign the qualifying offer by the 11:59 p.m. ET deadline Thursday, according to reports. \nThe Cavs have made different offers over the summer, going as high as $16 million in an average annual salary, according to ESPN. Thompson wants a three-year, $53 million max contract or a five-year deal for $94 million. \nThompson remains a restricted free agent, and negotiations between his representative, Rich Paul, and the Cavs will now continue. He has missed the start of training camp this week. \nThe 24-year-old Thompson averaged 8.5 points and 8.0 rebounds during the 2014-15 regular season when he was the Cavs' sixth man. After Kevin Love was injured in the first round of the playoffs, Thompson started at power forward. In the NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors, he averaged 11.6 points and 12.6 rebounds. \nCavs star LeBron James was asked about Thompson's situation at the team's media day on Monday. \n\"As the leader of this team, I understand how important Tristan is to this team,\" James said. \"I think we all saw what he's able to do in the postseason, and not only the postseason but all throughout. ... He's a huge piece to the puzzle, to our success. Not having him here today, possibly tomorrow or however long it is, that the organization and Tristan, they'll get something done. We all know how important he is to our success.\" Distributed by LAKANA and The Sports Xchange. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
