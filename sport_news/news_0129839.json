To make their first trip to the World Series since 1945, the Cubs will have to win four games in a row against a Mets team with a deep, strong rotation and an offense that’s clicking on most cylinders.\nMORE: Top photos from the NLCS | Klapisch on Mets: Who are these guys?\nThat comeback attempt starts Wednesday.\nMORE: Five takeaways from Game 3 | Strange inning key to Mets' win\n“I put all my stock in the fact that I know our guys are ready to play tomorrow,” Cubs manager Joe Maddon said after the Game 3 loss. “Then it moves back to Jon, then it moves back to Jake, and you kind of like those kind of things.”\nMORE: Murphy ties Beltran | Schwarber makes postseason history\nTo get to Jon Lester, though, and to get to Jake Arrieta, the Cubs have to be better than they have been the first three games. That’s not to say they’ve been bad, but the Mets have been better.\nAnd for the Cubs to be better, these four things have to happen.\n1. Survive the opening frame © Provided by Sporting News Let's start at the very beginning, a very good place to start. The Mets have scored at least one run in the first inning all three games of the series.\nIn the opener, Daniel Murphy hit a solo home run off Lester. In Game 2, David Wright hit an RBI double, and then Murphy tacked on a two-run homer off Arrieta.\n“The three-run inning held up pretty well for them throughout the entire game,” Maddon said after that contest.\nOn Tuesday, Wright singled and scored all the way from first base — he was running on the pitch — when Yoenis Cespedes hit a double into the gap. Boom, 1-0, Mets.\nThis was actually an issue in the NLDS, too. The Cardinals scored in the first inning in three of the four games, but St. Louis didn’t have a rotation like the Mets', and the Cubs were able to win that division series in four games. They can’t afford to play from behind again in Game 4.\n2. Find middle-of-the-order production © Provided by Sporting News Kyle Schwarber has provided plenty of power in the postseason, and Dexter Fowler has done a decent job getting on base as the leadoff guy, but they’re not getting a lot of help.\nKris Bryant, the No. 3 hitter, is bating .182 in the NLCS. Cleanup man Anthony Rizzo is at .200. Starlin Castro’s at .167. Miguel Montero is hitting .143, and Javier Baez has an identical average. You get the point.\nTo beat the Mets, the Cubs are going to have to string together a couple of hits, like they did in the series against the Cardinals.\nOr, at the very least, put runners on ahead of Schwarber so he’s not hitting solo home runs. Not only have the Cubs not won a game in this series, they haven’t even had the lead in this series.\nSteven Matz is an incredibly talented young lefty, but he's also the least accomplished of New York's starters. The Cubs have to unleash up a barrage of quality at-bats against the lefty.\n3. Tighten up defensively © Provided by Sporting News The Cubs only committed one official error in Game 3, but it was far from a clean defensive effort. The Strike 3 pitch that got past catcher Miguel Montero and allowed Cespedes to score from third in the sixth wasn’t an awful play by Montero, but it’s a play that has to be made in the postseason; you cannot allow a team to score a go-ahead run on a two-out strikeout.\nAnd though the Mets didn’t wind up scoring on the play, Wilmer Flores’ ground-rule double in the sixth inning really should have been a single, if right fielder Jorge Soler had opted to field the sinking line drive on a bounce instead of making the risky head-first dive to try to make the highlight-reel out.\n4. Hammel has to be outstanding © Provided by Sporting News The Cubs used seven pitchers in Game 3. Nobody, with the obvious exception of starter Kyle Hendricks, threw more than an inning or 19 pitches, so they should all be ready for Game 4 action, if asked by Maddon.\nAnd even though Maddon won’t hesitate to dial up relief help — “We'll start Jason tomorrow, and just like you saw today, if we have to go to the bullpen early, we'll do that,” he said. “We actually did a pretty good job.” — he’d rather not have to, because that would mean that Hammel gave Maddon a reason to look for help.\nIn his final 13 starts of the season, Hammel pitched more than five innings just four times. The length of his Game 4 start isn’t the main concern; it’s the quality of those innings. The Cubs would be absolutely thrilled with five shutout innings.\nThey can’t afford to go into a hole while the right-hander is on the mound.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb-news/4658826-nlcs-2015-five-takeaways-from-mets-win-over-the-cubs-in-game-3", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4658527-nlcs-2015-mets-cubs-photos-pictures-mlb-postseason-playoffs-daniel-murphy-starlin-castro/slide/367315", "http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb-news/4658829-nlcs-2015-mets-cubs-daniel-murphy-sweep-degrom-cespedes-mlb-playoffs", "http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb-news/4658822-nlcs-2015-cubs-mets-cespedes-strikeout-flores-soler-fowler-conforto", "http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb-news/4658819-nlcs-2015-cubs-mets-daniel-murphy-ties-record-consecutive-games-homer-beltran", "http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb-news/4658818-nlcs-2015-cubs-mets-kyle-schwarber-home-run-homer-rookie-franchise-record-playoff"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:03:49.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
