The thrd slot is a jump ball between Pequea Valley, Annville-Cleona and Lancaster Mennonite. \nWith the Section Two title pretty much in hand, Elizabethtown is in from Section Two. Joining the Bears? \nWith two matches remaining on the schedule four teams can still consider themselves contenders for the remaining playoff invitation. \nCocalico and Ephrata are currently tied for second — they meet Tuesday, in Denver, in a match moved from Monday to accommodate a scheduling conflict — with Lampeter-Strasburg and Manheim Central still with an outside shot. \nAfter facing each other on Tuesday, Cocalico (8-2-1, 25 points) and Ephrata (8-3-1, 25 points) finish Wednesday with Cocalico at Lebanon (0-12) and Ephrata hosting Garden Spot (4-7). The Eagles also have a makeup match at Garden Spot still outstanding. \nL-S (7-5, 21) hosts Manheim (6-3-2, 20) on Monday. The Pioneers host E-town (10-1, 30) on Wednesday while Manheim hosts Solanco (1-11). \nWith the Section Three title all but clinched, after defeating Donegal on Wednesday, Elco (10-1-1, 31) got bushwhacked by Lancaster Mennonite Friday , as the Blazers battled the Raiders to a 0-0 tie \nIt's within the realm of possibility that Donegal (9-2, 27) could slip past Elco. With a road trip to Annville-Cleona (6-5) still on the books, the Indians travel to Mennonite (5-5) Monday and host Pequea Valley (6-5-1) Wednesday. \nElco, meanwhile, finishes with Lebanon Catholic (2-10) at home and travels to Lancaster Catholic (3-9). \nWho will win Section One? \nAs of this moment, Manheim Township (8-1-1, 25) has a razor's edge on Conestoga Valley (8-2, 24) and Hempfield (7-2-1, 22). \nTownship travels to Hempfield Tuesday evening and finishes at home Thursday with Penn Manor (3-7-1). \nCV hosts Cedar Crest (5-4-1) Tuesday — the Falcons were eliminated from playoff contention Saturday with a 2-0 loss to Township — before closing out the schedule at Hempfield on Thursday.
