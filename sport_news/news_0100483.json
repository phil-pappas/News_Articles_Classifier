Fans chanted his name as the game ended.\n\"It's not me; it's this team,\" Campbell said. \"These guys want it. To watch the transformation they've made and the ownership they've begun to take, I'm glad I'm part of it.\"\nCampbell is only the fifth interim coach of 26 in the NFL since 2000 to win his first two games, according to STATS. Since the firing of Joe Philbin on Oct. 5, the Dolphins (3-3) have gone from notorious underachievers to contending for their first playoff berth since 2008.\n\"I always said this team had the players and playmakers and talent to play like we have the last two weeks,\" Tannehill said. \"For whatever reason we weren't showing up the way we wanted to.\"\nThe Texans (2-5) are heading the other direction. To compound their misery, running back Arian Foster hobbled off the field late in the game with an Achilles tendon injury that might end his season.\nMiami faces a quick turnaround before playing Thursday at AFC East leader New England (6-0).\nRedskins 31, Bucs 30: Kirk Cousins threw three second-half touchdown passes, including the go-ahead score with 24 seconds left, to lead Washington to the largest comeback in franchise history. Tampa Bay (2-4) was up 24-0 in the second quarter, before Cousins ran for an 8-yard TD to get Washington (3-4) on the board. Cousins hadn't completed more than one TD pass in any game all season. But he got a pair of 3-yard scores in the third quarter, sandwiched around an onside kick, to make things interesting. Then, trailing 30-24, Washington got the ball at its 20 with a little less than 21/2 minutes left in the fourth quarter. Cousins capped the drive with a 6-yard TD toss to Jordan Reed.\nVikings 28, Lions 19: Teddy Bridgewater threw for a season-high 316 yards and two touchdowns for Minnesota. Adrian Peterson rushed for 98 yards as the Vikings (4-2) won an NFC North game on the road for the first time in three years. The Lions (1-6) had an 11-point lead after Matthew Stafford threw TDs on their first two drives, but they blew it because they couldn't protect the quarterback. Minnesota had a season-high seven sacks.\nFalcons 10, Titans 7: Matt Ryan threw for 251 yards and a touchdown pass, and Devonta Freeman ran for 116 yards. The Falcons (6-1) bounced back from their first loss and overcome two interceptions. Freeman notched his third consecutive game with at least 100 yards, and Atlanta outgained Tennessee 378-256. The banged-up Titans (1-5) lost their fifth straight overall. They played without rookie quarterback Marcus Mariota , who was replaced by Zach Mettenberger.\nRams 24, Browns 6: Rookie Todd Gurley rushed for 128 yards and his first two touchdowns, helping St. Louis to the win. St. Louis (3-3) had four sacks and recovered four fumbles. The Rams scored 10 points off miscues on Cleveland's first two series: a 17-yard fumble recovery by Rodney McLeod and a field goal after the first of William Hayes ' two sacks and strips of Josh McCown . Johnny Manziel got mop-up duty for the Browns (2-5) after McCown left favoring his right arm with about four minutes left.\nChiefs 23, Steelers 13: Alex Smith threw for 251 yards and a touchdown, and Cairo Santos kicked three field goals as Kansas City ended a five-game losing streak. Charcandrick West added 110 yards rushing and his first career touchdown for the Chiefs (2-5), and Eric Berry intercepted his first pass since his cancer diagnosis this past December. Meanwhile, the Chiefs shut down Pittsburgh's Landry Jones , who made his first NFL start in place of the injured Ben Roethlisberger and Mike Vick . Jones threw for 209 yards and a touchdown, but he also was picked off twice and lost a fumble. LeVeon Bell ran for 121 yards for the Steelers (4-3).\nSaints 27, Colts 21: Drew Brees threw for 255 yards and one touchdown, Khiry Robinson ran for two scores and New Orleans held on. New Orleans (3-4) has won three of its past four. Indy (3-4) still leads the AFC South despite losing its second straight. Brees finished 28 of 44 and was helped by a running game led by Mark Ingram , who ran for 143 yards and one score as New Orleans took a 27-0 lead. Andrew Luck threw TD passes of 87 and 46 yards to T.Y. Hilton as well as an 8-yard TD pass to Donte Moncrief .\nRaiders 37, Chargers 29: Derek Carr threw three touchdown passes, including a 52-yarder to Amari Cooper , and the Oakland Raiders turned two interceptions of Philip Rivers into 10 points. It was the first meeting of the Raiders (3-3) and Chargers (2-5) since their owners announced plans to build a $1.7 billion stadium in an industrial Los Angeles suburb if they can't get new stadiums in their home markets. Coming off a bye, the Raiders looked quicker and more efficient. Cooper, the first-round draft pick out of Alabama, caught a short pass from Carr on an inside screen and raced through the defense to give Oakland a 30-3 lead just before halftime. San Diego made it close with three fourth-quarter touchdowns.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/56/8850362/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/56/8850360/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/56/8850360/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/60/56/8850362/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-26T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:31:33.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
