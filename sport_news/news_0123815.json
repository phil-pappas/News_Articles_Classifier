It is like something out of a Kafka novel.\"\nAtletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone caused a storm early this season when he hinted that Real Madrid would somehow be helped to win La Liga, in part because it has won only one title in seven years.\n\"The league is dangerously prepared for Real Madrid,\" Simeone said at the time. \"Madrid cannot go seven years with only winning one league. This year I think that sadly it is difficult to see another team winning it.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:45:04.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
