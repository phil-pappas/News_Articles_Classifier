The Horned Frogs took advantage of the turnover with a 13-yard touchdown pass to freshman wide receiver KaVontae Turpin to give them a 7-0 lead.\nThe Longhorns' struggles snowballed after a fourth-down snap flew over freshman punter Michael Dickson's head and through the end zone for a safety. TCU scored again on the following possession, extending its lead to 16-0.\nThe Horned Frogs onslaught continued through the first quarter as they scored two more touchdowns to push their lead to 30-0.\nWhile the Longhorn defense gave up 28 points in the first quarter, their offense didn't help them as they only managed to gain 137 yards in the first half while scoring no points.\n\"We obviously didn't do enough in the first half offensively to make it very competitive early,\" wide receiver coach Jay Norvell said. \"That was very disappointing.\"\nTexas had its chances, though, as it was able to get inside TCU's 25-yard line twice in the first half. But senior kicker Nick Rose missed both field goal attempts.\nAfter an abysmal first half, the Longhorns entered the locker room down 37-0. Strong said after Texas' last two games, he expected more fight from his team.\n\"We knew this was a good team,\" Strong said. \"We knew this is the No. 4 team in the country. But still, though, that should not stop us from going out and playing our best.\"\nAfter Texas' first half and the 50-7 loss, the Longhorn players are searching for answers. As the Longhorns' game with No. 15 Oklahoma looms, sophomore running back D'Onta Foreman said they have a lot to fix.\n\"We have to clean up our mistakes,\" Foreman said. \"As a team, we just got to come together and figure out why we made mistakes.\"\nTCU 50, Texas 7: Complete coverage\nBox score\nDiscuss this and the Big 12 with Chuck Carlton on Thursday; ask questions now.\nPhotos: See the celebration as TCU dominates Longhorns\nTwitter reaction: Texas 'can't blame this one on the refs'\nFive thoughts: Longhorns blown out, QB replaced in 50-7 loss to TCU\nTexas quotable: 'We don't know how to compete'\nLonghorns freshman on Twitter during halftime with team down 37-0\nMiscues aplenty as Texas 'just didn't play hard' against TCU\nCarlton: Unbeaten Oklahoma rolls into Cotton Bowl, as Texas staggers along\nFive thoughts: TCU erupts in first quarter, beats Texas in back-to-back seasons\nTCU quotable: Boykin, Doctson reflect on record-breaking day\nCarlton: TCU shows it can rely on more than miracles in rout of Texas\nJosh Boyce congratulates Josh Doctson, his replacement as TCU's top TD catcher\nOn Twitter:\n @Nick_Castillo74", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/texas-rangers/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/carlton-unbeaten-oklahoma-rolls-cotton-bowl-astexas-staggers-along", "http://d-news.co/SYNiW", "http://dallasnews.stats.com/cfb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=201510030085&home=85&vis=83&final=true", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/tcuhornedfrogs/2015/10/03/tcu-quotable-boykin-doctson-reflect-record-breaking-day-patterson-just-need-count-blessings", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/longhorns-freshman-twitter-halftime-team-37-0", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/tcuhornedfrogs/2015/10/03/five-thoughts-tcu-erupts-first-quarter-beats-texas-back-back-seasons", "https://twitter.com/Nick_Castillo74", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/twitter-reaction-texas-blame-one-refs", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/texas-quotable-know-compete", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/carlton-tcu-shows-can-rely-miracles-rout-texas", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/photos-see-celebration-tcu-dominates-longhorns", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/miscues-aplenty-texas-just-play-hard-tcu", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/five-thoughts-texas-first-quarter-woes-lead-50-7-loss-tcu", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/josh-boyce-congratulates-josh-doctson-replacement-tcus-top-td-catcher"], "published": "2015-10-04T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:55:04.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
