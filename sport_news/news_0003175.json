Signal photo by Dan Watson A A A \nIt took the Hart girls volleyball team three games to get into a rhythm. \nBut once it did, it was able to put away a hard-fighting Saugus team in four games by scores of 25-13, 23-25, 25-22, 25-17 at Hart High on Thursday evening. \n“Game four we played more of our tempo and the girls felt a little more energized,” said Hart head coach Mary Keen, whose team remains undefeated in the Foothill League with a 3-0 record, and 7-3 overall. \nThe Indians’ Lexi Chabiniak and Brooke Boron and got into a groove in the third game of the match after the two league foes were knotted up at a game apiece. \nBoron was able to capitalize in the middle, and had a match-high 13 kills and five blocks. Chabiniak finished the night with 10 kills and three blocks. \nAshley Aponik, who got the start at setter because Madi Fay was ill, led the Indians with 34 assists, while Sarah Coblentz added eight kills and four blocks. \nThe Saugus girls volleyball team tried everything it could to pull out a win over Hart. \nThe Centurions were diving all over the court, hitting 3-balls over the net in desperation, and Alison Ritchie even scored a point off a block while falling to the floor. \n“I felt because we won the first game 25-13 they started to get more casual about (the match and) thinking that they were just going to get (the win),” said Keen. \nBut Saugus’ intensity wasn’t enough. \nThe Cents were led by Ritchie, who had nine kills and by senior Jessica Jimenez with six kills. Jimenez also had two aces to break a 22-all tie in the second game and Ritchie finished it off with a kill into the middle. \nWith the loss, Saugus drops to 1-2 in league play and 9-10 overall. But Luckenbach still sees the positives. \n“What wasn’t disappointing was that we fought the entire way though,” Luckenbach said. “I think that’s a good quality that we’ve adopted from the beginning of the year and we try to make sure we’re working the entire match.” \nValencia 3, Golden Valley 0 \nComing off its first league win in nearly four years, Golden Valley was unable to make it two in a row as Valencia swept the Grizzlies by scores of 25-12, 25-17, 25-12. \nThe Vikings spread the ball around to Lauren Russ and Emily Burns, who each had a team-high eight kills. \nSydney Overton led the Grizzlies with eight kills and six digs. \nValencia joins Hart as the only undefeated team in the Foothill League with a 3-0 league record. The Vikings are 7-0 overall. \nGolden Valley moves to 6-9 overall and 1-2 in league. \nWest Ranch 3, Canyon 1 \nWest Ranch was able to withstand a first-game loss and won three straight games to beat Canyon in four games by scores of 23-25, 25-9, 25-17, 25-11. \nThe Wildcats nabbed their first league win of the season to move them to 1-2 in Foothill play and 9-7 overall. \nThe Cowboys drop to 5-5 overall and 0-3 in league with the loss. \nHillcrest Christian 3, Einstein 2 \nIn a matchup of the Omega League’s top two teams, Albert Einstein Academy gave up a two-game lead to lose to Hillcrest Christian of Thousand Oaks on Thursday. \nHillcrest won by game scores of 23-25, 15-25, 25-14, 25-14, 15-13. \nSenior Caroline Malka led Einstein with 12 kills and four blocks as the Rockets (9-5 overall, 6-1 Omega League) tallied 17 total blocks in the match. \nHillcrest (10-4-1, 8-0) takes the upper hand in league, but the two teams will rematch on Oct. 27 at Hillcrest. \nHeritage Christian 3, Trinity 0 \nIn a non-conference match, Trinity lost to Heritage Christian of CIF-Southern Section Division 2AA in straight games by scores of 25-11, 25-19, 25-23. \nHannah Caddow and JaNasjua Bethke led the Knights with four kills each, while Jessica Eblin added four aces and seven assists. \nKathryn Brooks had a team-high eight assists. \nTrinity is 16-7-1 overall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:15:56.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
