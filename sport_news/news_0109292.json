It doesn’t have the finger-licking waffles and crisp bacon that breakfast lays claim to, and most of us don’t have time to make the casseroles or meat-and-potatoes dishes we enjoy at dinnertime. Heck, it can be tough to even escape from our desks to get a midday meal in.\nFor Paleo lovers, lunchtime can be even more of a challenge—no grains typically means no sandwiches, and how many salads can one person eat? No need to stress. The following recipes are easy to make and take to work so you have a hearty, flavorful meal that will help you stay awake and focused the rest of the day. But you don't need to be on the Paleo plan to enjoy them: Feel free to add them to your brown bag rotation no matter what “diet” you follow.\nSandwiches Photo: Bev Cooks 1. Chipotle Chicken Lettuce Wraps If you think lettuce wraps are limp and too light to sustain you, get ready to have your mind—and taste buds—blown. Between the roasted sweet corn, sautéed chicken, and spicy homemade chipotle sauce, your lettuce won’t know what hit it. Plus, they're super easy to make, and you can use any extra chicken in other sandwiches or on grain bowls later in the week.\n2. Cuban Picadillo Lettuce Wraps Sure, it might not be the most authentic picadillo recipe, but it's probably one of the tastiest. Ground beef is combined with capers, green olives, bell peppers, and seasonings, then topped with fresh pico de gallo. Despite the lengthy list of ingredients, it's easy to make (and all of those ingredients are easy to find)—and who doesn't like a taco-ish meal?\n3. Italian Sub Roll-Up We all know it’s what’s inside the sandwich that counts, and that’s why this is genius. Forget the bread or lettuce leaves; your deli meats are the wrap and filling here. Overlap two rows of your faves on wax paper, place your favorite veggie fillings on one side, roll it all up, and slice in half. It’s super adaptable and so delicious.\n4. California Turkey and Bacon Wraps With Basil Mayo Satisfy your California dreaming with these West Coast-inspired wraps. Spread lettuce leaves with a fresh basil-mayo combo ( make your own mayo if you're a die-hard Paleo), then stack deli turkey slices, your favorite bacon, thin-sliced avocados, and tomatoes. Roll ‘em up like burritos and enjoy.\n5. Steak and Sriracha Lettuce Wraps These taste as good as they look. The steak keeps you feeling full, while onions and peppers give it a fajita feel. Sriracha adds a good amount of spice, but if you like things hot, load ‘er up! Adding a side of avocado to this one gives it an extra boost of healthy fats to absorb the veggies' nutrients, plus a pop of color.\nBowls Photo: Lexi's Clean Kitchen 6. Cajun Garlic Shrimp Noodle Bowls Shrimp meals tend to come together quickly, and this one is no exception. Cajun-seasoned crustaceans are cooked with onions and peppers, then piled atop a bed of zucchini noodles . Best of all, this tastes great hot or at room temp, so if you don't have a microwave at work, no worries.\n7. Egg Roll in a Bowl Satisfy your Chinese takeout cravings with this inverted egg roll. Fiber-full cabbage gets sliced and diced, then sautéed with carrots, coconut aminos (a Paleo lover’s answer to soy sauce), sesame oil, and green onions. We recommend making this heartier by adding protein like eggs or meat.\n8. Mexican Paleo Super Bowl Fries and chicken tenders don’t exactly sound like health foods. Except when you’re whipping up baked carrot fries and sautéed chicken strips. Serve ‘em with pico de gallo for tomato’s healthy benefits, eggs for extra protein, iron-rich spinach, and silky smooth avocado, and you’ve got a bowl that’s south-of-the-border worthy.\n9. Bowl of Doom The more accurate name for this might be “bowl of amazing.” Make a hash-like combo of potassium-rich sweet potato and ground beef, then cook an egg how you like it. Transfer the hash to a portable container, top with the egg, and pack some salsa and avocado to add once you're ready to dig it.\n10. Burrito Bowl What’s a burrito bowl without rice? Pretty darn tasty. Use broccoli slaw that's sautéed with onions, peppers, and celery as an antioxidant-loaded base, then add the usual suspects: spicy beef, cilantro, salsa, and avocado. There's no need for beans or cheese when you have all this flavor, plus the fiber and protein to fill you up.\n11. Cuban Sandwich Bowls With crispy cabbage, sweet shredded pork, salty deli ham, creamy avocado, fried plantains, and tangy mojo sauce, who needs bread? Make the pork and plantains ahead of time on the weekend, then pack a serving of everything into a plastic container, and tote it to work on a day when you have back-to-back-to-back meetings—this way you'll be sure you don't miss lunch (or resort to leftover doughnuts from the break room).\nSalads Photo: The Londoner 12. BLT Bowl It’s all the good parts of a BLT, plus a few extra additions that you'll love. Crispy bacon, juicy tomatoes, and fresh lettuce welcome avocado, cucumber, feta cheese (strict Paleos, simply omit this), and a balsamic dressing to the party for a meal worth celebrating. Or at least leaving your desk to enjoy.\n{{promotion.placement.html}} 13. Mason Jar Healthy Taco Salad Your co-workers will be jealous when they catch you eating this. Not only is the lunch delicious, but it’s portable too. You’ll get a good dose of protein thanks to chicken and a variety of colorful veggies, like red bell peppers, cucumbers, and tomatoes.\n14. Paleo Avocado Tuna Salad When you need a lunch that's ready in less than five minutes, turn to this recipe. Not only is tuna awesome for your heart , but it’s also hard to resist when stuffed inside an avocado half. Add a dash of lemon juice, salt, and pepper, and lunch is served. Plus you can easily pack all the ingredients (just remember that can opener!) and make it at work.\n15. Antipasto Salad If the Italian sub is your first choice at the deli, this antipasto salad is for you. Opt for meats free of weird ingredients and, if using jarred veggies like olives or sweet peppers, be sure they’re packed only in heart-healthy olive oil or vinegar. Served over a bed of your favorite leafy greens and drizzled with homemade Italian dressing, this is a real meal.\n16. Salmon Salad Power Bowls There are so many awesome things happening in this bowl: salmon, which is may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease ; high-fiber and low-sugar raspberries; and heart-healthy avocado oil. Choose your favorite greens and toss for a salad that's anything but sad.\n17. Broccoli Salad With Cashew Curry Dressing Although it's traditionally served as a side dish, this is filling enough to be a main course. A creamy curry-cashew dressing jazzes up basic broccoli, which is mixed with tart dried cranberries and bacon, then topped with crunchy sunflower seeds and cashews. So much flavor, texture, and color!\n18. Thai Chopped Chicken Salad This mason jar salad is bursting with fresh flavors. From mangos and roasted peppers to a spicy chili vinaigrette, it’s like a party in your mouth. And thanks to the jar, your lettuce won't get soggy while you wait for your lunch break.\n19. Zesty Lime, Shrimp, and Avocado Salad Similar to a ceviche, this one’s perfect for warmer days. Or simply avocado and seafood cravings. The recipe says it serves four, but we think it's better for two or three—otherwise, you'll be looking for the vending machine before dinnertime. A jalapeño brings the heat, but you can omit it or add more. Up to you.\nBurgers Photo: Joyful Healthy Eats 20. Paleo Burgers With Caramelized Balsamic Onions and Avocado These burgers are bursting with flavor, thanks to the caramelized onions sprinkled with balsamic vinegar. Served on a thick tomato slice (why didn’t we think of that?!) and topped with sliced avocado, this creation is one that even non-Paleo eaters will love.\n21. Lamb Burgers With Portobello Buns These are some of the tastiest, juiciest burgers you’ll ever eat, Paleo or not. Ground lamb is mixed with bacon, mushrooms, jalapeño, and seasonings to make the perfect patties. Served atop a grilled, buttered portobello “bun,” this is an awesome lunch recipe to mix up your usual midday routine.\n22. Mini Paleo Pizzas If you’re a burger fan, you’ll love this take on pizza. Sirloin patties make up the “crust” and are topped with your favorite pizza ingredients. We love a lot of veggies, but pepperoni and olives sound great too. If you’re eating primal, add a little cheese; skip if you’re doing strictly Paleo.\n23. Lean and Mean Turkey Meatloaf Muffins Sometimes you’ve got to scarf down lunch on the go. When you do, turn to these meatloaf muffins. Not only are they the perfect size for travel, but they’re easily adaptable to whatever’s in your fridge. We love the sweet onion, celery, and parsnip in the original, but spinach, ‘shrooms, or broccoli would be great substitutes as well. Further proof that anything tastes better made in a muffin tin .\n24. Smoky Grilled Pineapple Burger Smoky burger, meet sweet, sweet pineapple. You’ll love the flavor contrast of paprika-spiked beef (choose grass-fed for more omega-3 fatty acids) and grilled pineapple. Top with red onions for some crispy zing, and serve inside a lettuce leaf. Hawaiian shirts are optional.\n25. Paleo Cajun Burgers This looks like your basic burger... and then you sink your teeth in. Hello, Cajun spices! Think cayenne, cumin, garlic, paprika, and thyme. If your mouth is watering, good news: These come together fast. Serve them on lettuce leaves or, if you’ve got time to spare, bake the accompanying Paleo buns.\nSee the full story at Greatist.com", "external_links": ["http://sooopaleo.blogspot.com.co/2013/02/lean-mean-turkey-meatloaf-muffins.html", "http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/omega-3/art-20045614", "http://greatist.com/eat/healthy-zucchini-noodle-recipes", "http://www.thenourishinggourmet.com/2014/07/cuban-picadillo-lettuce-wraps-gf-df-paleo-friendly.html", "http://iowagirleats.com/2015/07/27/california-turkey-and-bacon-lettuce-wraps-with-basil-mayo/", "http://greatist.com/eat/healthy-casserole-recipes", "http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/HealthyDietGoals/Fish-and-Omega-3-Fatty-Acids_UCM_303248_Article.jsp", "http://greatist.com/eat/mason-jar-recipes", "http://sweetcsdesigns.com/steak-sriracha-lettuce-wraps/", "http://www.foodfaithfitness.com/mason-jar-healthy-taco-salad-recipe/", "http://greatist.com/eat/paleo-lunch-recipes?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=feed_http--greatistcom-", "http://www.cottercrunch.com/paleo-salmon-salad-veggie-bowls/", "http://cookeatpaleo.com/antipasto-salad/", "http://vicariouslypaleo.com/bowl-of-doom/", "http://fitviews.blogspot.com.co/2014/08/paleo-smoky-grilled-pineapple-burgers.html", "http://againstallgrain.com/2014/07/16/guest-post-paleo-cajun-burger/", "http://www.joyfulhealthyeats.com/paleo-burgers-caramelized-balsamic-onions-avocado/", "http://wickedspatula.com/cuban-sandwich-bowls/", "http://lexiscleankitchen.com/2015/04/13/thai-chopped-chicken-mason-jar-salad-with-chili-vinaigrette/", "http://greatist.com/health/choosing-healthiest-meats", "http://paleoleap.com/paleo-mayonnaise/", "http://www.thelondoner.me/2014/01/blt-bowl.html", "http://lexiscleankitchen.com/2014/09/08/cajun-garlic-shrimp-noodle-bowls/", "http://www.bigredkitchen.com/2012/06/mini-paleo-pizzas/", "http://www.skinnytaste.com/2011/05/zesty-lime-shrimp-and-avocado-salad.html", "http://primalbitesblog.com/2013/07/20/466/", "http://www.wholeyum.com/paleo-broccoli-salad-with-cashew-cream/", "http://empoweredsustenance.com/portobello-buns-paleo-foodie-cookbook/", "http://honeyandfigskitchen.com/2014/04/mexican-paleo-super-bowl.html", "http://www.ancestral-nutrition.com/paleo-egg-roll-bowl/", "http://www.katrina-runs.com/whole-30-day-20-pass-the-cheese", "http://bevcooks.com/2013/02/chipotle-chicken-lettuce-wraps/", "http://cookeatpaleo.com/paleo-avocado-tuna-salad/", "http://greatist.com/paleo", "http://greatist.com/eat/portable-muffin-tin-recipes", "http://greatist.com/{{promotion.placement.link_url}}"], "published": "2015-10-13T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:06:26.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
