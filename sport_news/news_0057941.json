Horsting is among Central Section leaders with five field goals, and is the Mustang defense’s best friend — 16 of his 32 kickoffs have resulted in touchbacks, which is a huge plus in high school football, and 18 of his 30 punts have landed inside the opponents’ 20-yard line. \nHowever, the key reason for the Mustangs resurgence is junior quarterback Andre Aguilar, a transfer from Mission Oak. \nAguilar had to sit out the first five games of the Mustang season because of CIF transfer rules, but with him under center, the Mustangs are 2-0 and are averaging over 40 points per game. \nAguilar’s dual-threat skill set makes him a nightmare for opposing defensive coordinators. In the win over Portervile, he threw for 199 yards and a pair of touchdowns, and scored the game-winning touchdown with a 20-yard touchdown run that made several Porterville defenders look silly. \nAguilar ended up with just 25 yards rushing, but if you take away the yards lost via sacks, he had 56 yards rushing on six carries. An 18-yard run by Aguilar on the Mustangs’ first offensive possession set up a touchdown pass to David Alcantar. Right before he scored the game-winning touchdown, Aguilar picked up a first down on a 3rd-and-1 play with an eight-yard gain. \n“When you look at it, this is really like Week 2 for him. He’s just started the season,” Tulare Western coach Ryan Rocha said on Friday. “Earlier in the game, Porterville was bringing everybody at him. But late in the game, they started to play back, and when you let an athlete (at quarterback) have some room, he’s going to make you plays. And (Aguilar) is an athlete.” \nThe consensus around the EYL was that Porterville was going to be Tulare Union’s top challenger for league supremacy. The Panthers could still complicate things this week when they host the Redskins — in what may be the finest running back matchup in Tulare County history with Romello Harris and Jones. But there is a growing sense that the Nov. 6 Bell Game between Tulare Western and Tulare Union will determine the outright EYL champion. \nIt’s going to be a very interesting Bell Game Week in Tulare to say the least. \nPlayoff Picture \nA look at how last week’s results affected the Central Section projected playoff brackets involving Tulare County teams: \nDivision II: Lemoore (6-2) continues to make on-field statements that it should be the No. 2 seed instead of Tulare Union (7-0) after Friday’s 49-0 win over Mt. Whitney. Lemoore has outscored its four West Yosemite League foes 181-19. Odds remain quite high that Tulare Union, still the projected No. 2 seed, will face one of its non-league opponents in the quarterfinals (Dinuba, El Diamante, Garces or Redwood). Projected top four seeds: 1. Ridgeview (7-0), 2. Tulare Union (7-0), 3. Lemoore (6-2), 4. Sanger (6-1). \nDivision III: Defending Division III champion Hanford (8-0) has been a bit fortuitous in its two visits to Visalia over the last two weeks. The Bullpups edged Redwood 28-26 on Oct. 9, and needed a fourth-quarter score to fend off Golden West on Friday (28-21 Hanford win). Tulare Western’s win over Porterville opened the door for the Mustangs to be a top-4 seed (the Mustangs will need to win their final three games to make that happen). Still, if Tulare Western finishes 6-4, it should host a first-round playoff game. Mt. Whitney (4-3) will also need to win two of its final three games to be a top-eight seed. Both the Pioneers and Mustangs are one win away from meeting their district’s mandate (.500 league or overall record) for postseason play. Projected top four seeds: 1. Hanford (8-0), 2. San Joaquin Memorial (6-1), 3. Madera (4-2), 4. Tehachapi (5-1). \nDivision IV: Any reliable projections for this bracket were bruised up quite a bit with Washington Union (4-3) upsetting Chowchilla (5-2) 30-12. Chowchilla was considered the clear frontrunner for the No. 1 seed. CVC (5-2) is still in the mix for one of the top four seeds if it can win a share of the Central Sequoia League championship. Projected top four seeds: 1. Cesar Chavez (6-1), 2. Selma (6-1), 3. Washington Union (4-3), 4. Chowchilla (5-2). \nDivision V: Woodlake (5-2) and Lindsay (3-4) are the county’s top hopefuls in this bracket, and both are projected to be top-8 seeds at this point. Even with a 43-20 loss last week to Bishop Diego-Santa Barbara, Immanuel (6-1) is the prohibitive favorite. Projected top four seeds: 1. Immanuel (6-1), 2. Fowler (4-2), 3. Mendota (4-3), 4. Woodlake (5-2). \nDivision VI: Defending Division VI champion RFK (7-1) is shaping up to be the prohibitive favorite for a second straight year. No Tulare County school has a winning record. \nNews and Notes \n• Romello Watch: The official stats from Tulare Union’s 42-0 win over Delano had Romello Harris with 297 yards rushing and three touchdowns, which allowed him to join the 7,000-yard club for career rushing yards. Harris is up to 1,839 yards rushing on the season, and 7,207 yards rushing in his career. He ranks second in the state this season in yards rushing, and fifth in the nation in yards rushing per game (306.5). Harris is 555 yards away from breaking Dominique Dorsey’s school career rushing record (7,761) and he is 823 yards away from becoming the Central Section’s all-time career leading rusher (Mendota’s Edgar Segura finished with 8,029 yards). \n• East Sequoia League Showdown: Woodlake and Lindsay remained the only unbeaten teams in East Sequoia League action with victories on Friday. Woodlake dismantled defending ESL champion Corcoran 48-0 on Friday. Robby Stevenson, grandson of Woodlake legendary coach Leon Robinson, had a terrific outing for Woodlake last week. Stevenson was 7-of-8 passing for 141 yards and four touchdowns. Lindsay stopped Granite Hills 20-17 for its second straight win under first-year head coach Matt Mendonca. The Cardinals picked off four passes, and sophomore placekicker Agustin Valdovinos booted two field goals, which proved to be the difference. Sole possession of first place will be on the line this week at Leo Robinson Field with Woodlake hosting Lindsay. Game time is 7:15 p.m. \nCream of the Crop \nOne view of the top five teams in Tulare County: \n1. Tulare Union (7-0): Even without junior quarterback Josh Guerrero, the Redskins had no problems taking care of Delano. If Guerrero is missing again this week — he was injured in the EYL opener against Monache — it could make things interesting against Porterville. \n2. Tulare Western (4-3): Mustangs have a chance to make another statement Friday night against three-time defending EYL champion Mission Oak (3-4, 1-1). \n3. Dinuba (4-4): Emperors have a tall task ahead of them this week with a visit to Selma (6-1, 1-0). \n4. CVC (5-2): Cavaliers are right back in the middle of the CSL title picture if they can upend Kingsburg (5-2, 1-0) at home on Friday. \n5. Porterville (2-5): Rest of the county is likely pulling hard for the Panthers this week. A win by Porterville opens up the door for the EYL championship being shared three ways. \nAnother view: Calpreps’ rankings of all 18 Tulare County teams has Tulare Union at No. 1, followed by Dinuba, CVC, Porterville, Mt. Whitney, El Diamante, Redwood, Exeter, Tulare Western, Mission Oak, Golden West, Monache, Woodlake, Lindsay, Strathmore, Granite Hills, Farmersville and Orosi. 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://vtd-tar.co/1LHE0Td TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:33:19.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
