The conversion came just seconds after Worstell tossed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Aaron Male. The Cavaliers then elected to go for the win. The play capped a 10-point comeback by Walsh. The Cavaliers trailed 24-14 in the third quarter. A touchdown run by Worstell and a 26-yard field goal by Michael Dudics with 5:56 left in the game forced overtime. Worstell finished the game 22-of-32 for 247 yards with two touchdowns and one interception. Aaron Male was the leading rusher for Walsh with 124 yards on 15 carries. Findlay was led by Daiquone Ford with 178 yards and a touchdown on 34 carries. NORTHERN MICHIGAN 41, MALONE 13 Four turnovers doomed Malone as they fell on the road Saturday. Malone lost two fumbles and threw two interceptions. The Pioneers fumbled six times total. Matt Blasiole led the offensive effort for the Pioneers as he had 131 yards and the lone touchdown on 28 carries. It was the ninth rushing touchdown of the season for Blasiole. Blasiole is the first Malone running back since Joseph Peters in 2009 to have that many rushing touchdowns in a season. Northern Michigan quarterback Shaye Brown was 15-for-18 for 185 yards and three touchdowns.
