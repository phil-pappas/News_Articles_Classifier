But the highlight may have been its stunningly effective power play. The Heat’s special teams produced three goals in the opener, and hopes to keep the success going as it plays host to the San Jose Barracuda at 7 p.m. Thursday at Stockton Arena. It wasn’t just that the power play went 3 for 6 in Stockton’s 7-0 win against the Rockford IceHogs. The Heat didn’t score on its first power play opportunity, but had several good chances and moved the puck well. There wasn’t a power play in which the Heat didn’t get at least one really good look at the net. “You want your PP to generate momentum for you, whether you score or not,” Heat coach Ryan Huska said. “I thought our players were sharp and prepared, and they were hungry.” Defenseman Jakub Nakladal played the point much of the time when Stockton had a man-advantage, and used his hard shot to produce two assists. Two of Kenny Agostino’s three assistant came on power plays. “(Nakladal) can hit it really well, we knew that about him,” Huska said. “ think he’s confident in fact that he has to use it for us have success.” “It was a great start, and it was important because you need to start the season well or you have problems,” said Nakladal, who played nine seasons in Europe before joining the Calgary Flames organization. “Now we can have more confidence. But still, it was one game, and we have a lot of work to do.” The schedule ahead After Thursday’s contest, the Heat leaves Stockton for road games at the Texas Stars (Oct. 21), San Antonio Rampage (Oct. 24) and San Diego Gulls (Oct. 30-31). It returns to Stockton Arena for Hot Pink 1, which is dedicated to breast cancer awareness, when it plays the Bakersfield Condors on Nov. 6 and Ontario Reign on Nov. 7. Constant back to Thunder Veteran defenseman Ryan Constant, who played six seasons with the Stockton Thunder of the ECHL, is back with his old club, now known as the Adirondack Thunder in the ECHL. Constant, 30, had a tryout with the Heat and was released by the AHL team on Oct. 3. He was signed to an ECHL contract by Adirondack last week. He played 304 games with the Stockton Thunder (2008-15). — Contact reporter Scott Linesburgh at (209) 546-8281 or slinesburgh@recordnet.com.
