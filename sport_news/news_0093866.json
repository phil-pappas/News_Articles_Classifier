John Marks jmarks@lakewyliepilot.com Kerri Finigan will reopen Fat Cats in Lake Wylie as Fini’z Oyster Bar & Grill. John Marks jmarks@lakewyliepilot.com 1 of 2 LAKE WYLIE \nFat Cats will soon become Fini’z. \nAn ownership change at Fat Cats Oyster Bar & Grill at Plantation Square makes way for Fini’z Oyster Bar & Grill. The new owners could be in place as early as this week. Many menu items and staff will remain, but customers will see some changes. \n“Different name, different environment,” said incoming owner Kerri Finigan. “Everything’s going to be new.” \nFinigan has 25 years in the restaurant business in Detroit. She moved to the area five years ago, where she met husband Robert. The pair picked Fat Cats for the atmosphere it already has, which they hope to build on. \nFinigan has been working at Fat Cats. \n“Everybody knows everybody,” Finigan said. “It’s all the same people who are in here every day.” \nFat Cats at 4555 Charlotte Highway is a long established restaurant location, previously as Local Motion Bar & Grill. A devoted customer base appealed to the new owners, who will keep the half dozen staff members and likely expand the number to 10. \nThe new menu will feature oysters, mussels, salmon, grouper and tuna, along with salads and burgers. \nFinigan wants more of a sit-down meal feel than bar food. \nRegular customers are excited about new plans for breakfast and more menu options, but mainly for the face they already know taking ownership. \n“We think Kerri will be the perfect owner,” said Joan Bundy. \nBundy ate lunch in a group of eight Oct. 15. The ladies come every other week to play bridge. They were unanimous in their support of the new owner. \n“She’s a personality that needs to be doing this,” said Carol Jeane Hooks. “She knows how to treat the customer.” \nPlans are to close Fat Cats on Oct. 28 and open as Fini’z the following day. Cosmetic changes will begin. Hours mostly will remain the same, open seven days a week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:02:20.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
