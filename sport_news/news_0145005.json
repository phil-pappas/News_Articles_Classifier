It’s just fun to write nonsense like that sometimes, to try fooling people into thinking I’ve been exposed to literature. John Steinbeck? Never heard of him. But I am familiar with the wit and wisdom of John Madden. \nAnd now, on with this week’s picks: \nIowa +7 at Wisconsin \nThe prophet says that’s a lot of points for this matchup. Sometimes, that’s all he has to say. \nIowa State -15.5 vs. Kansas \nAnything Kansas can do in football, anyone else can do better. The Cyclones will share first-place in the Big 12 after this triumph. \nOhio State -21 at Indiana \nOh, how the seer hates to throw this many points on the road. Indiana is 4-0. But what’s to stop the Buckeyes from scoring on every possession against such a woeful defense? Look for a score of something like 63-35. \nMinnesota +4 a t Northwestern \nHlastradamus makes the rounds in Chicago because that’s where he has a lot of flight connections. A flight attendant told him this could be a 13-10 game. But not 14-10. \nIllinois +7 vs. Nebraska \nHlastradamus tries to avoid making the rounds in Champaign, whatever the rounds in Champaign may be. But he has seen very erratic psychic waves floating over Nebraska so far this season. Or maybe that was just a cow belching in Ogallala.
