He made five starts for the Jays early in the season and eight starts for the Tigers after the Price trade, with Detroit winning six of those games. \nBefore this season, Norris was best known as the minor league pitcher who lived in a van in a Florida parking lot. It is expected Norris will make a full recovery and be ready to pitch next season. I've been debating for months as to how or even if I should share this with people. - I'm a firm… https://t.co/MhcaFY68cX — Daniel Norris (@DanielNorris18) October 19, 2015 just keep livin' — Daniel Norris (@DanielNorris18) October 15, 2015 \nTRADES AND ALMOST TRADES \nThe Blue Jays pursued last night’s pitcher Johnny Cueto before they landed David Price . They also pursued Ben Zobrist before they wound up with Price. Odds are, had they landed Cueto they wouldn’t have gotten Price and had they ended up with Zobrist, they would never have pursued Ben Revere. \nThere’s more to it than even that: The Jays offered minor-league pitcher Jeff Hoffman to Cincinnati for Cueto but the Reds asked for Monday night’s starter Marcus Stroman . The Jays weren’t willing to give up Stroman, who at that point was apparently out for the season. And when the Royals offered up Brandon Finnegan, the Reds had their deal. \nThe Jays actually pursued Zobrist before they learned Price was available. Some of the players, pitcher Matt Boyd for one, were offered up for Zobrist, who makes any team he is on better. \nThe fact the Jays couldn’t deal Hoffman to Cincinnati for Cueto, meant Hoffman was available to be the key piece in the trade the Jays made with Colorado for Troy Tulowitzki. \nAnd what are the odds of this: Cueto opposed Stroman Monday night in Game 3 of the American League Championship Series. \nTHIS AND THAT \nAggressive swinging Alcides Escobar led off the game with a line drive to right field, which birthday boy Jose Bautista misplayed into a three-base hit. It should have been scored a single and a two-base error. That’s one earned run that should not have counted against Stroman ... Ryan Goins, who blamed himself for the Jays defeat in Game 2 of the series, answered back quickly in Game 3. First he made a great defensive play early on before he had an opposite field two-out base hit in the bottom of the second inning that put Toronto up 2-1. Tulowitzki, who is back hitting, and Kevin Pillar scored on the play. When Goins scored on a base hit by Josh Donaldson , he slid home, and got up fist pumping. It had to be emotional for him ... John Gibbons seems unwilling to use reliever Liam Hendricks in the post-season and it’s somewhat understandable if you look at the statistics. Since Aug. 1, he’s made 23 appearances for the Jays and has a 5.12 earned run average in that time. Conversely, of those 23 appearances, 20 of them were relatively clean ... Starting pitcher Stroman did not have his A-stuff Monday night, but he didn’t need it with the Jays scoring nine runs in the first three innings. Stroman toughed his way through the night, lasting 61/3 innings. A lot of his outs came on balls hard hit ... If there is a Game 7 in this series, it’s likely set up to be Cueto vs. Stroman ... Stroman got a standing ovation walking off the field with a 10-4 lead. It isn’t often a pitcher gets to tip his cap to the crowd after giving up 11 hits. \nTUESDAY’S STARTER \nR.A. Dickey may not feel any more pressure because of the way Noah Syndergaard has pitched for the New York Mets but Syndergaard, who was part of the deal that brought Dickey to Toronto, has looked lights-out for the Mets. Dickey did surmise in his pre-game interview that he has thought about the possibility of a Game 7 between the Jays and the Mets, with him and young Syndergaard on the mound. \n“I think that would make for a great story,” said Dickey. “What a script that would be if I could Syndergaard in Game 7. Wouldn’t that be something?” About being a Met, Dickey said: “ I loved being a Bet. I’m hoping that we play those guys in the World Series. It would certainly make for a great narrative.” ... Manager Gibbons said all was well with he and Dickey after the early yank in Texas, but others around the clubhouse indicate otherwise. Everybody is all smiles now, even with the Jays trailing in the Series. Beneath the smiles you might find the truth ... Dickey on Daniel Murphy, the hottest home run hitter in the post-season: “I’ve always been a fan of Danny Murphy. He can hit, end of story. He wakes up talking about hitting. He knows mechanically exactly where he needs to be to be consistent. He is just a very good baseball player. And there’s not much more you can say about that ... he hits all the time and he loves to talk about it.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:54:12.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
