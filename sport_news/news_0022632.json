McGuire set the bar high against Arkansas State in 2014 \nCognizant of the resulting black eye for both, Ragin’ Cajuns coach Mark Hudspeth has declared he wants no carryover when the two teams meet Tuesday night in an ESPN2-televised game at Centennial Bank Stadium here. \n“We want to show the country how we play football,” Hudspeth said, “and we’re not getting into any of that extracurricular-type stuff. \n“That’s not who we are. We talked about it with our team — about respecting the game of football, playing with class, and how you represent your university and represent yourself. We’re not getting into that, I’ll you that right now.” \nHudspeth’s pre-emptive admonition evidently has been heard. \n“Coach Hud talked about it all week,” said running back Elijah McGuire, who ran for 265 yardS and four touchdowns against A-State last season. “As a Ragin’ Cajun team, we’re known as playing with class. \n“We don’t try and do anything dirty, cost our team any penalties, because penalties can cost you the game. … We’re just gonna come out and play a clean game and get back home.” \nNo matter what the temptation. \n“If we get carried away with all the other stuff — the hitting after the penalty, the throwing and the shoving game — that will get us out of our game,” said starting quarterback Jalen Nixon, who didn’t play in the 2014 game. “So we have to focus on playing football and going to take care of business. That’s all. \n“Trash-talking, all that, comes with the game. So that’s something we should be used to. But we just have to stay within ourselves, and stay together, and be, actually, disciplined to do the right things in-between the whistle and after the whistle.” \nThat established, however, the Cajuns haven’t forgotten what happened — and especially not what they perceive to have been the evening’s most egregious event, when then-senior Jackson allegedly dove into unsuspecting UL offensive lineman Mykhael Quave’s knee on a final-minute PAT. \nAlthough his injury wasn’t nearly as serious as initially suspected, Quave — an NFL prospect whose Cajun career ended earlier this month with a torn rotator cuff — was carted off the field. UL QB Nixon is magnet for Cajuns, family \n“It was a thing that shouldn’t have happened,” Nixon said. \n“We took that one to heart, because it’s a football game. In between the lines, you’re getting your butt kicked, you know what I’m saying? That doesn’t mean you have to go and dive at somebody’s knee. Nobody likes to see that on film. \n“Things like that, we look at it and kind of get our blood hyped,” the Cajun quarterback added. “So we’re gonna be ready to go.” \nWith both teams currently undefeated in Sun Belt play — 2-3 UL is 1-0, 3-3 A-State is 2-0 — the Cajuns must be if they’re to keep pace in the race for an outright conference title that’s eluded Hudspeth since his initial 2011 season at UL. \nThe Cajuns lost their final 2011 Sun Belt game to the Red Wolves, costing them part of a three-way SBC title tie with Arkansas State and Western Kentucky. \nHad UL beaten Arkansas State in 2012, four teams including the Cajuns would have tied for the championship rather than the Red Wolves winning at 7-1. \nIn 2013, Arkansas State and UL shared a co-title at 5-2 — even though the Cajuns won the head-to-head meeting. Cajuns easing back Reed, Washington \n“They’re a great team,” UL defensive-line starter Blain Winston said, “but we don’t need much motivation. You know, this goes way back — before I even committed here.” \n“It’s always been a big game,” Hudspeth added with reference to his UL coaching stint. “It’s always been a tough game. … I expect nothing less this time.” Read or Share this story: http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/sports/college/ul/2015/10/19/heated-matchup-ul-seeks-clean-game-after-14-ugliness/74218058/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:17:40.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
