Foss' goal came exactly one minute after the Cardinal's Michael DeGraffenreidt scored on a header to tie the match at 2-2. \"I've scored some long goals before, but that's definitely my longest,\" says Foss. \"It's pretty unbelievable. I didn't really know what to do. I sprinted to the bench. It was an awesome feeling.\" Foss also scored on a free kick in the 74th minute. The Cavaliers (6-1-2, 2-1-1 ACC) never trailed in the match, as Marcus Salandy-Defour scored in the 32nd minute to give UVa the 1-0 halftime lead. The junior tallied a goal on his first shot in his first game since 2013. Salandy-Defour missed all of last season with a knee injury, and was also sidelined for the first half of this season with injuries. The start time of the game was moved from 7:00 PM to 1:00 PM due to forecasted foul weather, and it was rainy and windy throughout the entire match. Head coach George Gelnovatch says, \"Today I would hate to be a goalkeeper. Seriously. Today is a goalkeeper's nightmare, and both teams took advantage of that, just getting dangerous balls, and crosses, and shots. A lot of them went in today, and we were fortunate that our last good chance went in.\" Virginia returns to action Monday at home against Portland.
