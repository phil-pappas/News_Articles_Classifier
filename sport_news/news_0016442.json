RT has really been an issue, Reiff is out of place, Warford has been bad/hurt. Laken's still learning. Swanson has his moments, but hasn't looked totally out of place. by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:36:06 PM dave your thoughts on the offensive line.. by laikoni 10/16/2015 2:35:08 PM Interesting to see if Caldwell names Stafford a captain today by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:35:07 PM Stafford throws for 5 TD's in a route over the Bears by Joe 10/16/2015 2:34:55 PM Getting my prediction out because Caldwell is starting soon: I have the Lions winning this week 23-20. Mostly because if they lose this season goes for disaster to dumpster fire and against a bad Bears team, they'll get it done. by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:34:49 PM He's not the most fleet of foot, but never has been. He does look a little more skittish in the pocket than usual this year, probably because of all the pounding he's taken. by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:33:53 PM Dave-Is it me or is Stafford unable to scramble out of the pocket? When pressured ( Which is often ) He moves side to side instead of going forward to at least gain some yards. by Hoss 10/16/2015 2:33:18 PM That made me laugh by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:33:14 PM If Trump were the Lions GM he would build a wall around Ford Field to keep all other teams fans from entry...he would implement a plan to keep the team from any and all illegal chop blocks and hands to the face penalties...he would implement a tax structure that would allow long suffering Lions fans to not have their sanity constantly taxed to the limit by Mark L 10/16/2015 2:33:08 PM The 90s were great, in comparison to just about everything, weren't they? by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:33:03 PM I'm 52 years of age...Life time Lion fan...hard to say...but the Wayne Fontes era was the \"glory years\" for the sad sack of a franchise by Wayne O 10/16/2015 2:32:48 PM He's got 2 more fully guaranteed seasons on his deal. He'll be 31 then. Not happening. by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:32:44 PM When Miami cuts ties with Suh and realize the mistake they made, the Lions bring back the best DT in football. by Joe 10/16/2015 2:32:22 PM That's been the most troubling thing from a coaching standpoint. The amount of times they've had free rushers, or had to take timeouts/penalties like last week for substitution problems. Not that that's all on coaching, but the look is not a good one. by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:32:21 PM The lions look consistently disorganized, this is the result of new plays, schemes or just an overall lack of discipline? by Ziggy 10/16/2015 2:31:35 PM So, no. Not really. by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:31:32 PM Would have to be a situation where a contender loses a key player and sees someone who could be of immediate help, like a Tate or Mathis. But from the Lions' standpoint, that means they're giving up on the season and that wouldn't help Mayhew, Caldwell, etc., with their jobs on the line. by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:31:25 PM Do you think any meaningful trades are possible that will produce future draft picks? by Jon B 10/16/2015 2:30:06 PM I don't think there's anything they can do to save this season. It's a lost cause, in my opinion. I just think they need to figure out exactly where to go for 2016. Major crossroads for the organization. by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:29:50 PM In your opinion, What is the one thing the lions could do NOW to improve themselves for the future, rather than keep going in reverse? by Jon B 10/16/2015 2:28:41 PM Beckham was rated very highly. Several scouts I talked to thought he had the best pro day they've ever seen. he was considered a potential top 10 pick by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:28:11 PM Mike that's what Ebron was, best player at the position of need. A WR/TE. Odell Beckham wasn't rated that high, he was considered a stretch at that point. by Joe 10/16/2015 2:27:39 PM And if you're talking about in the future, as much as I think Harbaugh will end up back in the NFL at some point, it's not happening soon. He can't leave his alma matter after one year and all this success. by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:27:33 PM Harbaugh is a very, very good coach. There's a reason he's won everywhere he's been. There's also a reason he's left everywhere he's been. He wears on people. The Lions didn't want that after the Schwartz regime. by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:27:07 PM Could Harbaugh even save these guys? by DieHardEverySeason 10/16/2015 2:26:15 PM It's a business at the end of the day, and when fans stop showing up to watch your product, people take notice. by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:26:14 PM How many season ticket holders are there?...Would a boycott do any good to affect the bottom line or at the very least embarrass the Fords? by tedd 10/16/2015 2:25:47 PM They've got guys of all backgrounds. Scott McEwen and Lance Newmark have been with the organization for 20+ years. Some of their regional scouts, like Joe Kelleher and Darren Anderson were hired under Mayhew. by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:25:43 PM Hello Dave, do you know if the college scouts on staff are new or still from the matt millen era. wondering if the lions problems root that deep. How about drafting the best player available for the position needed, not the best player available. by Mike 10/16/2015 2:24:36 PM No, but mostly because the Bears are bad, too. I get the sense a lot of Lions fans are unplugging from the season since there's nothing at stake anymore. by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:24:30 PM Do you think there will be more Bears fans than Lions fans at this weeks game? by Owen Sichstein 10/16/2015 2:24:03 PM I think that decision comes down to what else happens. If a new GM comes in, you can't force him to keep the coach. That's a recipe for disaster. If this locker room falls apart, you can't keep him no matter what. by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:23:52 PM Do you keep Caldwell after this season or rebuild again.. by laikoni 10/16/2015 2:23:05 PM Dallas has no cap room and a QB with a monster contract in Romo. Stafford would cost a lot if someone wanted to trade for him. by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:23:02 PM I would trade stafford to Dallas for a number one pick..thoughts.. by laikoni 10/16/2015 2:22:23 PM Chicken or egg. I see your point, but I don't think Stafford is in the elite class of QBs no matter where he goes. He's just not accurate enough and not a good enough decision maker. Plus, the Lions have given him everything to succeed here, or tried to. Calvin, Tate, Burleson, Best, Leshoure, Abdullah, Titus, Ebron, Pettigrew ... that's a lot of capital spent on skill guys by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:22:19 PM Is Stafford Mediocre or are the Lions once again ruining a top talent? Stafford in Houston or Dallas and hes winning a lot of games. by Joe 10/16/2015 2:20:44 PM The stadium is 13 years old. Not happening by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:20:39 PM Is it time to consider a retractable dome, and keep it open all football season. I think the Lions are too soft. by Owen Sichstein 10/16/2015 2:20:25 PM It all depends on these final 11 games. Wins cure everything. But the way they're headed right now, there could be a lot of turnover ahead. by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:20:21 PM I just can't see the Lions losing this week, but I see a new GM before the start of next year. Agreed? by Guaranteed win 10/16/2015 2:19:40 PM Well, they've spent two first-round picks on OL in the last four years (+ two third-rounders). Not that that's fixed anything ... Yeah, depending on where they're at, they need a pass rusher and DL does look like it could be a strength of the draft. by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:19:33 PM I know it's early, but some of the top prospects in the draft are in the trenches players. Do the Lions look to the O or D line in the draft? by Nick 10/16/2015 2:18:42 PM Also, is that a sign of settling for mediocriy by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:18:35 PM That's mostly true. Unless the Lions are in position to completely start over with the No. 1 pick. If you have the potential to get a star, you take it. by Dave Birkett 10/16/2015 2:17:56 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:37:42.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
