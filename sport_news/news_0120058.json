Just got tired of hearing it might be the reason he'd lost his feel lately.\nCame out as clean Saturday as the first day of basic training, and it didn't make any difference, at least not to the Astros in a 9-7 win over the Rangers.\nOf course, Jose Altuve's bullet through the box in the first could have had something to do with it, too.\n\"I got smoked,\" Holland said, and not just in the box score, either.\nHolland took Altuve's shot off his pitching hand, which is just one more thing for the Rangers to worry about as they position themselves for a beckoning postseason.\nLet's face it: Losing to the Astros in the middle portion of this three-game set for the championship of Texas was no fun, but as the Rangers try to figure out who's up after Cole Hamels in any possible playoff rotation, the quality of Holland's last four appearances hasn't exactly been encouraging in the hunt for a No. 2.\nSince back-to-back starts against Baltimore and the Angels in which Holland gave up one run in 17 innings, it's been mostly downhill.\nNine hits and five runs in seven innings against Seattle.\nTen hits and five runs in 52/3 innings against Houston.\nSeven hits and seven runs in 41/3 against Seattle.\nSeven hits and four runs, including three home runs, in five innings Saturday.\nThe Rangers insist nothing's the matter with Holland physically. His shoulder is fine. Only the numbers make him wince.\nAccording to BrooksBaseball.net, starting with the shutout of the Orioles, the velocity on Holland's two-seam fastball has gone from 94.4 to 94.3, 94.2, 94.0, 93.2 and 92.8 Saturday.\nJeff Banister doesn't read too much into those figures publicly. He knows a pitcher occasionally dials it back in the interests of improving control. Holland, in fact, said his fastball command was \"a lot better\" Saturday. Certainly looked it with two outs in the fourth, when he buried a pitch down and in to George Springer for a called strike three.\nSo if his fastball was so much better, what went wrong? Hung a slider and a changeup to Carlos Correa, who didn't miss either. Altuve homered on what Holland called \"a fairly good\" curve.\n\"That Altuve,\" Holland said, smiling, \"he's a pretty good hitter.\"\nThat's what I'd say, too, if I'd watched some pretty good years flash before my eyes as Holland did after just his second pitch. The return came back at him so fast, Holland only had time to duck, reflexively putting up his left hand in defense. The ball caught him square at the top of his palm, deflecting to second base. By the time Roogie Odor threw out Altuve, Rangers personnel had swarmed the mound.\nOnce the athletic trainers determined there was no serious damage, Holland, who said his hand was still numb, took a couple of warm-up pitches. The first bounced wide right to cheers from the 35,736.\nWhen the second cleared the plate, there wasn't much doubt what Holland would do.\n\"He said he could go,\" Banister said.\nWhether Holland's performance from that point on was a continuance of the issues he's faced lately or a result of the shot to his hand depends on your point of view. Of the first 12 balls the Astros put in play, seven qualified as rockets. Still, the rate declined over the next couple of innings.\n\"He probably didn't have the best feel for the baseball,\" Banister conceded, \"but he grinded it out well enough. Couple of home run balls got him. But I think the effort and conviction were there. Some of the execution was a little tough.\n\"But that came from getting hit in the hand, very first inning.\"\nHolland refused to use it as an excuse, which is what you've come to expect of him.\n\"I went out there and still competed,\" he said. \"If I've got to play hurt like that, that's fine.\n\"I tried everything I could to stay out there as long as I could.\"\nBecause the last thing any Rangers starter needs to do is revert to the form of early summer, when the failure of the rotation to work deep into games exposed the soft middle of the bullpen.\nAs for Holland's sore left hand, he said they'd check it out again Sunday for any possible complications. He's not looking ahead any further than that, saying speculation about possible postseason rotations will have to wait.\n\"We gotta clinch first,\" he said.\nGoal No. 1 now becomes the immediate concern of Martin Perez, who faces Dallas Kuechel on Sunday. Close behind clinching comes the priority of getting Holland right. They need to figure it out, and soon. For the record, I never thought it was his hair, either. But I'm not ruling out the aftereffects of Charlie Sheen.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KSherringtonDMN"], "published": "2015-09-27T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:46:21.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
