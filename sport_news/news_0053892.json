Miami canned Al Golden after the program's worst loss, a 58-0 pounding from Clemson.\nHurricanes athletics director Blake James didn't comment on the search for the full-time replacement after Sunday's move. But it's hard to imagine Cristobal won't be involved in the hunt. Bruce Feldman of FoxSports already listed him as the top candidate.\nThe Miami native played for the Hurricanes in the program's glory years, winning national titles in 1989 and 1991 as an offensive tackle. After that, he was hired three separate times to coach in Coral Gables.\nAfter his controversial firing as Florida International's coach in 2012, he briefly landed back at Miami for a third time. He was named tight ends coach Jan. 10, 2013 after six seasons building the nearby FIU program.\nA little more than a month later, Alabama hired Cristobal away to coach the offensive line.\nAlmost three seasons later, it would only make sense for Miami to look at Cristobal.\nHe showed the ability to turn around a struggling program when he turned FIU from a 0-12 team in 2006 into an 8-5 team in 2011 playing in a second straight bowl game.\nCristobal also attracts talent as well as anyone. He, after all, the consensus 2015 national recruiter of the year . And he knows South Florida. One of his top scores for Alabama was receiver Calvin Ridley, a Pompano Beach, Fla., product who picked the Tide over nearby Miami.\nThere are a few other factors to consider, though. Cristobal, despite being a head coach for six seasons, has never been a coordinator. That won't likely disqualify him from anything, it's just notable.\nMiami's also gone after former players from the glory years to clean up the slumping power. Randy Shannon graduated just before Cristobal arrived in 1989 and won a national title in 1987. His firing in 2012 ended a four-year run and resulted in Golden's hiring.\nMuch has changed since that last coaching change.\nMiami survived a nearly-disastrous NCAA investigation and cycled through a few ADs. Julio Frenk replaced Donna Shalala as the school's president earlier this year. Now he and James face their biggest athletic decision of their respective tenures.\nWill they turn to a familiar face? A month of football separates today and the serious negotiation phase as Miami joins the USCs and South Carolinas in the search of a new head coach.", "external_links": ["http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-hurricanes/sfl-mario-cristobal-hired-as-miami-receivers-coach-20130110-story.html", "http://www.foxsports.com/college-football/story/miami-hurricanes-al-golden-fired-new-coach-candidates-alabama-cristobal-colts-chudzinski-102515", "http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-hurricanes/sfl-um-fires-coach-al-golden-day-20151025-story.html#navtype=outfit"], "published": "2015-10-26T09:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:06:03.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
