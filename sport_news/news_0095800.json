Nor more important. They won when Cole Hamels wasn't up to it and Shawn Tolleson didn't look so hot, either.\nOwning a 2-game lead over the Angels and 2 1/2 over the Astros because of their loss to the Mariners, the Rangers need to finish off the Tigers today, not so much to ward off the Angels but to keep the Astros from creeping back.\nEven if the Rangers lose to Detroit in the series finale, they could still hold off the Angels by splitting the four-game set in Arlington.\nBut they can't afford to let Houston sneak back into the race. Scott Kazmir hasn't made it out of the fourth inning in his last two starts for the Astros, but the Mariners are taking volunteers for tonight's start. After a day off Thursday, the Astros finish with three in Arizona. They'll have to make a very Mike Napoli kind of decision: Do they play Evan Gattis, the designated hitter, in left field? He's no Drew Stubbs, but, unlike Napoli going into this season, he's played it before.\nMeanwhile, Yovani Gallardo makes his last case for the postseason, if there's going to be one for the Rangers. He's 0-2 with a 6.43 ERA in his last three starts.\nTime to make a statement, and maybe take a little of the drama out of this weekend.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KSherringtonDMN"], "published": "2015-09-30T18:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:41:36.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
