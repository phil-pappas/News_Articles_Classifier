We try to do the best thing we can, based on what the defense is doing.\n\"As long as we’re operating efficiently, and we’re trying to do the right thing based on how we’re defended, we feel like all our players on the field can do some good things for us, and we’re just trying to make positive plays, stay ahead on down and distance, convert on third down, and in the scoring area. He is certainly a significant factor in all those areas. We try to do a good job putting him in position to make the plays that he can make. In some games, certain guys are going to get the ball more than others. Some of that does have to do with how we’re being defended.”\nWith teams taking Gronk away, other Patriots have been targeted. In Indy, it was spread around with Danny Amendola (7 catches, 105 yards) and Julian Edelman (6 catches, 50 yards, TD) getting the most action.\nAsked if he was concerned about Gronkowski, who had three catches for 50 yards and a touchdown against the Colts, not getting as many touches, McDaniels didn’t seem too bothered.\n“I think Rob is very unselfish, and if it comes to him 20 times a game, he’d try to make 20 plays, and if it doesn’t, he’s going to do his job on each snap,” said McDaniels. “He did a great job of blocking the other day. He impacted the game in the passing game, catching some critical passes, third down and in the red zone. Certainly, we’re going to try to keep putting him in position to make a huge impact in the game because we know what kind of player he is.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:34:17.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
