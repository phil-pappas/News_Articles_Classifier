It didn't give a breakdown of the destinations but pointed to rising demand elsewhere in western Europe.\nIn Germany itself, registrations of both German-made and foreign-branded cars climbed 5 percent to a total 272,500. VDA said that new registrations of diesel cars accounted for about 47 percent of the total and were up 8 percent.\nThe group didn't break down the number of cars sold at home and exported by individual manufacturers.
