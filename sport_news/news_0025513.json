Whether he'll play is uncertain after being called up by Ghana for Tuesday's friendly with Canada in Washington .\nHe could face Red Bulls teammate and Canadian defender Karl Ouimette , whose potential absence further complicates matters as New York defender Matt Miazga is with the U.S. U-23 team.\nToronto (14-13-4) could be more negatively impacted. Michael Bradley will return from a call up to the United States national team, though his health is somewhat in question.\nThe club will remain short-handed in the attack with Sebastian Giovinco (Italy) and Jozy Altidore (United States) still on international duty. The duo accounts for 33 of the club's 55 league goals.\nThat likely clears the way for Herculez Gomez to make his first home start since joining Toronto from Puebla of Liga MX in August. Gomez made his only start against Seattle on Sept. 5, and Toronto has lost all four games in which he's appeared. The former U.S. national team member figures to be accompanied up top by Luke Moore .\nRegardless of personnel, the Red Bulls have dominated the series with a 33-10 aggregate and six shutouts over a 9-1-4 span. That includes a 3-0 win Aug. 15 with Bradley Wright-Phillips scoring in a third straight meeting.\nToronto, however, enters on a three-match winning streak after a 3-0 home win over Philadelphia on Oct. 3. It was the club's third straight match with three goals scored, but Giovinco and Altidore accounted for six.\nThat places even more pressure on a back line that's conceded a league-high 34 goals in 16 matches since the start of July.\n\"It's a balance we have to find between offensive skill and defensive skill,\" midfielder Benoit Cheyrou told the club's official website.\nThe streak has Toronto entering its final three matches in fifth place, a point up on Montreal and five ahead of Orlando for the final playoff spot. Toronto, which has never won four straight, also has a game in hand on the three teams it's looking up at, and second-place D.C. is two points ahead.\nA tie will secure it a playoff spot.\nSports & Recreation Soccer New York Red Bulls Toronto FC   19314/79545   2482/10000   1214/4772  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:27:50.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
