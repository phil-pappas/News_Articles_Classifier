HILLSDALE — The NV/Old Tappan football players huddled together after Friday night’s game against Pascack Valley, raising their helmets in unison. Suddenly, one of the players let out a yell.\n“Still No.1,” he said from within the crowd. “That’s what I’m talking about.”\nThere’s no disputing that. Not after what the Golden Knights, No. 1 in The Record public football Top 20, did to No. 2 Pascack Valley.\nThe Golden Knights (6-0) put all their offensive weapons on display early and often, romping past the Indians, 42-14, in Big North crossover action.\n“This was important for us after what happened last year,” said NV/OT senior quarterback Kevin Martinez. “They beat us twice, and we wanted this bad. We wanted some revenge, and I think we did the job.”\nThe loss snapped the Indians’ North Jersey-best nine-game winning streak, and was just the second in 24 games on their home field since the end of the 2011 season.\n“Let’s cut to the chase,” said PV coach Craig Nielsen. “The better team won.”\nThe Golden Knights dictated the tempo right from their game-opening drive, marching 55 yards in 12 plays over 6:03 to take a 7-0 lead on a 4-yard pass from senior Jordan Fuller to senior running back Zach DeNike.\nThe Indians (5-1) scored on their first possession, and NV/OT went ahead on the final play of the first quarter on a 3-yard touchdown run by Fuller.\nThe stage seemed to be set for a good-old-fashioned barnburner, but the Golden Knights had other plans.\nThree plays later, Fuller intercepted a Colin Dedrick pass and returned it 49 yards for a touchdown.\nThat was the turning point in the game because it really seemed to take some life out of the Indians.\n“That was a great run,” said NV/Old Tappan coach Brian Dunn. “He had some great blocks, and a wall was just leading him. It was a big-time play.”\nThe Golden Knights, who came into the game averaging a North-Jersey best 47.4 points per game, didn’t let up. They kept churning out one big play after another, shredding the PV defense en route to a 35-7 halftime lead.\n“For me, it was all a blur,” Fuller said. “The younger guys responded great, and everybody just did their job.”\nThat includes Fuller, the All-America defensive back who once again rose to the occasion against a top-shelf opponent. He threw two touchdown passes, caught two passes for 45 yards and carried 10 times for 35 yards and a touchdown.\nBut he also had plenty of help. DeNike, who has emerged as one of North Jersey’s most effective runners, churned out 116 yards on 19 carries.\nMartinez completed 6 of 9 passes for 146 yards and a touchdown. Senior tight end Jedh Downey caught three passes for 90 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for another.\nAnd while the vaunted NV/OT starting defense did allow a touchdown for the first time in four games, the Golden Knights did an outstanding job shutting down the PV passing game, especially when the game was tight. Dedrick threw for 170 yards, but couldn’t get things going with star receiver Mike Pimpinella.\n“I know they like to lull you to sleep with their running game and then kill you with the passing game,” Fuller said. “I was happy we stopped the run, and happy we were able to lock them down, for the most part.\n“Right now, we just have confidence. That’s a good team that we beat, so we know we can play with anyone.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:54:25.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
