(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) \nNFL Network’s Ian Rapoport joined ESPN 980’s “The Drive with Cooley and Czabe” on Wednesday and said, while the Redskins look a lot better than he thought they would this season, the Giants are his favorite to win the NFC East. \nRapoport added that he would give the edge to the Cowboys if they had everyone healthy, but they don’t, which led to an interesting discussion about how teams value backup quarterbacks and a comment about Kirk Cousins that really makes you think. \n“It’s worth it to be like the Colts and pay Matt Hasselbeck $4 million and say, he might not ever play,” Rapoport said of Indianapolis’ 40-year-old insurance policy for Andrew Luck, who has missed the Colts’ last two games. “But if he does, we’re going to have a chance, and they went 2-0. The Cowboys chose Brandon Weeden ($660,000 base salary) over going that route, and they have paid for it. For the Redskins, the Redskins have not obviously drafted great over the last couple of years, but Kirk Cousins has to be one of the best draft picks they ever made. And they got killed at the time, but I was in favor of it, because, to me, you can never possibly spend enough capital on quarterbacks. Draft picks, money, trade, do everything you possibly can, because if you’re lost there, then you’re lost completely.” \n[ Cooley: If you blame Kirk Cousins for OT interception, you’re a moron ] \nWhoa, whoa, whoa. WHOA . Kirk Cousins as one of the best draft picks the Redskins’ ever made? Right now, he’s probably not even the best quarterback the Redskins drafted after taking another QB with a top-3 pick of the first round in the same year. Rapoport’s larger point that the Redskins would likely be worse off had they not drafted Cousins in 2012, stands. The Browns took Weeden 20 picks after Robert Griffin III that year, which is not one of the best draft picks that franchise has ever made. \nLater in the interview, Cooley asked Rapoport if Griffin, who has been inactive for all five of the Redskins’ games this year, has any trade value. \n“I wouldn’t say [Griffin’s trade value] is zero, because he’s a quarterback who has been extremely successful in the league,” Rapoport said. ” … There’s a lot of questions. obviously, about RGIII, but physically, can he run like he did? Probably not, so that’s sort of diminished right there, because if he was able to do all that, he’d be starting. I think there would be some value if the Redskins were willing to do it, because someone is going to take him and say I can turn this into the guy that [he was] before. The problem with RGIII is, let’s say, if you’re not a contending team, then what are you giving up a draft pick for, for a quarterback who might not be a part of your future? If you are a contending team, do you want to deal with the public — not backlash, but response — to trading for RGIII? Because…if you’re a contending team without an entrenched, franchise starter, RGIII on the roster means RGIII is the story every single week of the season. And that kind of sucks for him, just like it sucks for Tim Tebow, but it’s also reality. So, I wouldn’t say his trade value is great, but I wouldn’t say it’s crazy [for a team to trade for him] either, especially if a team gets in a place where they just have to have a quarterback.” \n[ Clinton Portis says Alfred Morris should be the ‘lead dog’ ] \nCooley also asked if Alfred Morris, who had only eight carries in last week’s loss to the Falcons, could be traded. \n“That is a little more complicated, and not because teams don’t like him, because I know they do, but he’s obviously heading into a contract year,” Rapoport said. “So basically, it would be you would trade for Alfred Morris, you would give up, say, a mid-round pick. That’s probably what it would end up being, right? A third- or fourth-rounder, something like that, but then you’d also have to give him a contract extension. … It’s the pick and the contract extension that make it just too expensive. It’s the same reason why when players [are given the franchise tag], no one ever trades for them, because you’d be giving up the pick, and paying the salary, sort of the double-whammy.” \nListen to Rapoport’s full segment here .
