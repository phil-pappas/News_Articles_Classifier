But we finished sixth and the Oceania Cup is our last chance. We have to win. If we don't, I really don't want to know. It's probably the biggest game most of us will play.\" \nJenness said the preparation for the match had gone well. \n\"There was a lot of disappointment early on after we missed qualifying. But now our focus is on beating Australia and qualifying for Rio,\" he said. \n\"We played well against them on Thursday even though we lost 3-1. We were holding a few things back for Sunday. I think the boys will take a lot out of that game. Everyone's excited and ready to book their that ticket to Rio. We need to start well and if we do that we'll be fine.\" \nJenness, who has played 139 games for his country, is no stranger to Taranaki. \n\"I lived in New Plymouth for four or five years and went to St Pius X School. I played hockey for Spotswood Primary but then we moved back to Wellington.\" \nThe feature game on Saturday is the transtasman clash between the Blacks Sticks women and Australia. \nBoth teams have already qualified for Rio, but there's still plenty to play for with world ranking points up for grabs. It's also an important part of the New Zealand team's buildup to the World League final in Argentina in December. \nAT A GLANCE \n8am, NZ Invitational women v Samoa \n10am, Australia men v Samoa \nMidday, Blacks Sticks men v Fiji \n2pm, Blacks Sticks women v Australia", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:33:50.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
