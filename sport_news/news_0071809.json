She starred in a series of famous movies, including Miracle on 34th Street and five films alongside John Wayne.\nShe was never nominated for an Academy Award, but was awarded an honorary Oscar in 2014 for career achievements. She is one of only two actresses, along with Myrna Loy, to receive an Oscar without being nominated for one.\nO'Hara was born Maureen Fitzsimons on Aug. 17, 1920, in Dublin, Ireland, and trained as a singer and dancer as a young girl in Dublin. She became an accomplished singer, but was rarely a featured singer on film.\nO'Hara maintained dual citizenship in Ireland and the United States, after becoming a naturalized citizen in 1946.\nShe was also the first female president of an American-based airline.\nI was lucky enough to meet Maureen O'Hara once a long time ago. She was wonderful, as you'd expect. RIP. pic.twitter.com/lvltF9U5lR\n— Tara Flynn (@TaraFlynn) October 24, 2015 Her acting career started with a role in the Alfred Hitchcock production Jamaica Inn before starring in The Hunchback of Notre Dame , both in 1939, and the Oscar-winning film How Green Was My Valley in 1941 by legendary director by John Ford.\nBut it was her role in the Christmas classic Miracle on 34th Street a few years later that set her on the path to becoming a Hollywood legend.\nHer association with Wayne began when Ford paired them in three movies - Rio Grande , The Quiet Man and The Wings of Eagles . She would later star with him in McLintock! and Big Jake .\nVery sad to hear that Maureen O'Hara has died. What a great actress! Was only watching The Quiet Man today! #MaureenOHara\n— Laura Clarke (@lclarke13) October 24, 2015 O'Hara was known for playing tough, iron-willed women, which mirrored her real life persona. This was most prominent in her films with Wayne, especially The Quiet Man and McLintock! . Both movies feature her and Wayne in volatile romantic relationships. She fights with him in both movies and threatens divorce, but he ultimately wins her affection after publicly shaming her.\nIn The Quiet Man , Wayne's character physically removes her from a train and walks her back home as onlookers watch. He wins her back by fighting her brother to gain the dowry he had denied them.\nIn McLintock! , which is based on William Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew , they are separated and she threatens divorce over his infidelity. They ultimately reconcile after he chases her through town and spanks her while a large crowd cheers him on.\nO'Hara also clashed with Wayne in Rio Grande , playing his estranged wife who came to the cavalry camp where his troops are stationed to remove their son from the Army. They were also estranged lovers in Big Jake , but when their grandson is kidnapped they work together to save him and again reconcile in the end.\nTheir relationship may have been rocky on screen, but the co-stars were good friends off screen, though they were never romantically involved.\nO'Hara was married three times and had one child with her second husband, director William Huston Price. Her third husband, Charles Blair, was the founder of Antilles Air Boats, an airline based in the U.S. Virgin Islands. She inherited the airline when Blair was killed in a plane crash in 1978, becoming the first female president of an American airline.\nThough she lived a long life, O'Hara did not suffer many medical issues. She had short-term memory loss later in life and in 2012 her family alleged she was a victim of elder abuse. Shortly afterward, she sold her home in Ireland and moved to live with family in Idaho.\nShe has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and was named the Irish American of the Year in 2005.\nCopyright 2015 Raycom News Network.
