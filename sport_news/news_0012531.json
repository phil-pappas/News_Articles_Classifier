Online gallery at herald-review.com/gallery Buy Now \nTaylorville’s Miranda Coy chips on to the green on No. 11 during the first round on Friday. \nDECATUR – Lauren Chappell had the upper hand before her round even started Friday, in that she’s already won two state championships. \nBut the best players, Chappell included, still feel pressure when they get to the first tee. \n“Just I guess doing it for the third time,” said Chappell, the Charleston junior who’s trying to win her third Class A girls golf state title. “A little bit of pressure. \n“The first hole, I was pretty nervous. I three putted – didn’t hit a good first putt.” \nChappell started by going backwards, losing a stroke on the first hole, but made par on the next six and settled in. After back-to-back bogeys before making the turn, she birdied her first hole (No. 12) and birdied No. 18 to card a first-round 74 Friday at Red Tail Run Golf Club. She’s the tournament leader by herself entering today’s final round. \nLast season, she led by one after the first day and maintained the gap to win. \nAs a freshman in 2013, she shot a first-round 68 but was in second place by one stroke. With a final-round 73, she won by five shots. \nOn Friday, she narrowly avoided a backbreaking final two holes. She missed a short par putt on No. 17 to bogey and drop to 3-over. \nShe sent her drive on the par five 18th left of the fairway, landing about five feet from the water hazard. But with a strong wind at her back, she was able to land her second shot on the green. She narrowly missed an eagle try and settled for birdie. \n“I missed a putt on 17, but came back with a birdie so I guess it was a good finish,” Chappell said. “It worked out all right.” \nShe leads Richmond-Burton’s Mackenzie Hahn by one shot and Rochester’s Morgan Savage by four. In the swing \nWhat better time could there have been for Charleston junior Aislinn Parish to find her swing than a couple days before the state tournament. \nParish has played better than the 100 she carded at Monday’s sectional, but at that point she was still struggling with her irons – usually her strength. \n“She was struggling so much through the regional and sectional with iron play,” Charleston coach Deb Lanshaw said. “She had the dreaded ‘S’ word – shanks – so bad. \n“She’s a very good iron player and to lose that ability really put her in a deep mental funk.” \nParish recorded a 91 in the first round Friday, proving she’s found her swing. \n“It was kind of bad timing for the bad swing, but it just came back a couple days ago,” Parish said. “I was really lucky. \n“It felt like my normal swing again. I could hit my sand wedge fine, so I pretended like every iron was my sand wedge and I was just hitting it in the air.” \nAt practice Wednesday, Parish tried it out for Lanshaw. \n“She comes up to me with this kind of sad dog look on her face and says, ‘Can you watch me hit a minute?’ ” Lanshaw said. “She pulled out an iron, crushed it, and she said, ‘I got it back!’ We all did a little happy dance. \n“It came back as quickly as it left her. We had tried everything … and finally it just clicked with her again. I don’t know what happened or what fixed it, but I’m glad it did.” \nParish’s score, plus Ally O’Dell’s 87, Morgan Sherwood’s 90 and Chappell’s lead have the Trojans in second place as a team. Massac County has a six-shot cushion. Rochester is third, five shots behind Charleston. Schedule change \nExpecting to be hit with frigid temperatures that could cause frost this morning, the IHSA announced Friday that the final round would be played from a shotgun start. \nGroups will all start from different holes, beginning at 9:30 a.m. \nLanshaw said delays may be expected, since the grass can’t be walked on when it’s frosted, but a shotgun start will help the tournament move more quickly and absorb a possible delay. Also in the field \nTaylorville’s Miranda Coy is in 47th place after an 18-over score in the first round. \n“Today was a little rough, a little cold and we started on the back, so it was a harder nine,” Coy said. “The first few holes were just getting out there and warming up. I kind of brought it together and started driving better and that brought everything back.” \nCoy was 10-over on her first eight holes, but only 8-over through the next 10. \nLincoln’s Rachel Lockenour finished with a 104. She didn’t make a par in her round. Meanwhile at Hickory \nChappell isn’t the only player this weekend going for a three-peat at state. \nNeuqua Valley’s Jessica Yuen is also looking to accomplish the feat, but she is two strokes behind the leaders in the Class AA state tournament at Hickory Point. \nHinsdale Central’s Jessica Lee and Barrington’s Reena Sulkar share the lead after finishing 1-under par on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T11:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:47:38.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
