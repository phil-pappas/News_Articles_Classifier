Just wait. It won’t take any time at all for the Blue Jays and Kansas City Royals to build up their animosity.\nThese teams have plenty of bad blood from the last time they saw each other. It should serve as quite a backdrop to the American League Championship Series that opens Friday night in Kauffman Stadium.\nGo back to July 30-Aug. 2 in Rogers Centre. The Blue Jays started a four-game set against Kansas City at 51-51, and were two days removed from acquiring Troy Tulowitzki. The Royals hit town 61-39 and had already run away with the AL Central. But in a seminal moment to its season, Toronto started its postseason push by winning three of four.\nThere was an epic extra-inning game on July 31, won by Josh Donaldson’s RBI single in the 11th and marked by David Price’s arrival in the dugout during the game to join his new teammates. And the Blue Jays’ win in the finale was a contentious affair marked by multiple plunkings or attempted plunkings and a benches-clearing incident in the eighth inning.\nKansas City’s Edinson Volquez got things heated up by drilling Donaldson in the first inning of that game and the Royals continued to go after the Blue Jays’ MVP candidate. Oddly enough, the benches did not clear until Toronto reliever Aaron Sanchez nailed Alcides Escobar in the eighth.\nVolquez was held back when the teams flooded the field but didn’t hold back to the media afterward.\n“He’s a little baby, he was crying like a baby,” Volquez said of Donaldson. “He got mad at everybody like he’s Barry Bonds. He’s not Barry Bonds.” Donaldson responded with a take-that about not wanting to see Volquez get ejected from games because he was “good hitting.”\nTrue to 2015, things went to Twitter when Kansas City pitcher Yordano Ventura criticized Jose Bautista in Spanish for pimping at the plate. He even called Bautista a nobody. Bautista tweeted that he had “lost respect” for Kansas City manager Ned Yost. Imagine what the Royals think of Bautista’s bat-flip-heard-around-baseball that won Wednesday’s game.\nSaid Bautista of Ventura the next day: “I think he’s a young player that could use some maturing. Hopefully he focuses on playing the game and allows his ability to create a name for himself.”\nWho’s starting Game One Friday night for Kansas City? Volquez. Game Two Saturday night? Ventura.\nAsked Thursday if he thought this series is bound for problems, Yost downplayed the issue. But asked about the need to pitch the Blue Jays inside and not worry about their objections, Yost made his club’s plan clear.\n“I’m not a mind reader, I’m not a fortune teller, I don’t know if it’s going to be an issue,” Yost said. “We’ll pitch inside aggressively. That’s a power-laden club over there. We’re going to formulate a really good game plan and try to go out and execute.”\n“It happened so long ago. And right now so much is at stake,” Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said after his team arrived in KC. “You get careless out there and you do something stupid, it could cost your team a big game. You’re trying to win this thing. I don’t anticipate any of that.”\nBautista’s bat flip after the blast that beat the Rangers was the talk of the sports world Thursday. Sam Dyson, the Texas reliever who got taken deep, was thoroughly disgusted by it in the aftermath of the clincher.\n“He’s a huge role model for the younger generation that is coming up playing this game, and he’s doing stuff kids do in wiffle ball games and backyard baseball,” Dyson said of Bautista. “It shouldn’t be done.”\nOf course, a cynic would point out that Dyson could simply avoid throwing up a 93-mph meatball that left the ballpark at 113 mph and there would be no problem.\n“You look at all professional sports in general, everybody celebrates more so than they used to,” Gibbons said. “And I think in our particular sport, if it’s happening for your team, your guy hits a big hit, nobody minds it. If you’re on the other side nobody likes it. ... If it’s for you, you don’t mind and you turn your back. If it’s against you, you’re probably a little more vocal.”\nBat flips and beanballs? At some point, this series should get pretty heated. Might just happen right from Game One.\nThe rosters\nThe Blue Jays set their rotation by going to Marco Estrada in Game One, followed by Price, Marcus Stroman and R.A. Dickey. The Blue Jays will be able to get Price back on his regular day and have things set up for Price and Stroman to throw in Games Six and Seven.\nThe Toronto bullpen will get the return of situational lefty Aaron Loup, who missed the last three games against Texas due to a family matter. The teams have until Friday morning to announce final decisions.\nThe homefield\nIt became a cause celebre in Toronto over the last week of the season as the Blue Jays dropped four of their final five games and ended two games behind Kansas City after the teams were tied through 157 games.\nBy winning the season series, 4-3, Toronto simply needed to finish tied to get the homefield edge in this one. The Blue Jays, remember, were 53-28 at home this year and only 40-41 on the road. The Royals were 51-30 at Kauffman, 44-37 on the road.\nThe prediction\nThe series comes on the 30th anniversary of the 1985 ALCS, which saw Kansas City overcome a 3-1 deficit to beat the Blue Jays in seven games. The last two came at old Exhibition Stadium in Toronto and the Blue Jays, in their first postseason, didn’t get to their first World Series for another seven years.\nThe Blue Jays honored that ’85 team last month in Rogers Centre and several players were still seething over that defeat, which came in the first year the ALCS expanded from best-of-five to best-of-seven. Bautista, Edwin Encarnacion and others took note of the celebration, wondering what it would be like to come back to town 30 years from now. They also made note how much the alumni struggled with the defeat. Gives them some food for thought in this series.\nThe Blue Jays have a bludgeoning offense that was quiet the first two games against the Rangers before finally breaking out, although it’s hard to pound your opponents in October. Gibbons admitted prior to Game Five his club seemed jittery at the plate and in the field in the first two division series games but seemed like itself the rest of the series once Tulowitzki released the pressure bubble with his three-run homer that broke open Game Three in Texas.\nThe Royals, of course, got to Game Seven of the World Series last year. This is all pretty new to the Blue Jays. Kansas City has a slight edge in the bullpen and team speed and that might prove to be a difference. Call it Royals in seven. Maybe by a run. Maybe even in extra innings. It’s that close.\nemail: mharrington@buffnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:40:28.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
