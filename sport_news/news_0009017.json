The following is a grading of Utah's loss to USC. Offense: C- \nOn first reaction, Utah's offense should receive a near failing grade for how bad the game seemed. Losing by 28 points does not necessarily boost confidence in any aspect of the team, but looking past the end score, Utah's offense wasn't as bad as it seems … sort of. \nSure, Wilson threw four interceptions, and that's what ultimately led to the rout. But Utah managed a respectable amount of receiving yards, rivaling its highs on the season of the Oregon (257) and Arizona State (297) games. Unfortunately for Utah, it's an empty set of numbers since the Utes couldn't find a way to get a lot of points on the board. \nDespite the turnovers, Wilson finished the night 24-of-36 for 254 yards and two touchdowns. He targeted seven receivers, with freshman Britain Covey having a standout night. Covey finished the night with 129 receiving yards and two touchdowns on seven receptions. \nDevontae Booker had a relatively quiet night, rushing for 64 yards on 14 carries and 49 receiving yards on six catches. Utah, though, wasn't able to use Booker too much, having been down by a couple scores. Had Utah kept it close, Booker would have been an integral part of the offense. Defense: C \nUtah's defense struggled for much of the night to contain USC receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster as he dominated in the passing game. The defense struggled to cover on USC crossing routes and looked slow to contain, allowing Smith-Schuster and running back Ronald Jones II to extend plays and give USC some life. \nIn several instances, Utah's defense was on top of USC on third downs, but penalties and bad angles on tackles allowed USC to convert many times. While Utah would never make an excuse for injured players, namely starting linebacker Jared Norris, the team missed his leadership and overall ability on the field. \nFor the defense, though, Gionni Paul had one of the best performances of his career. Paul was aggressive and kept USC under some sort of control and kept the game from really getting out of control. Paul finished the night with 17 total tackles, 5.5 tackles for loss, one forced fumble and a sack. Special teams: A- \nAfter last week's dismal performance from the special teams unit, it bounced back and had a good showing. The special teams unit was lead by Covey, who nearly had a punt return for a touchdown. His 40-yard punt return was downed at USC's 2-yard line, setting the Utes up for a quick touchdown by Bubba Poole. \nTom Hackett had another good night punting the ball, averaging 43.2 yards per punt on five punts. Hackett had three of his punts downed inside the 20-yard line. Andy Phillips, too, had a good night, making a 53-yard field goal for his career long. Coaching: A- \nOverall, the coaching wasn't too bad. The coaches stuck with Wilson despite the turnovers and set Utah up for some good play opportunities. Ultimately, though, the players needed to make plays and keep Utah in the game. While it's easy to get critical of a play call, the coaching staff had its players in position to win the game. Overall: C+ \nUtah and USC's offense were relatively comparable in Saturday's game in terms of performance. However, USC found a way to get the most of its offense, while Utah struggled to maintain any sense of momentum. The defense did as good of a job containing USC as it seemingly could despite the extremely talented players. Utah looked more like an average team against the Trojans. \nNo. 3 Utah's Travis Wilson threw four interceptions as USC went on to a 42-24 blowout win, ending the undefeated streak for the Utes. While it was not a great performance for the Utes, not all was bad for the team.
