A resident of Baterla village, Mamta Devi, was murdered in 2012 and the police had arrested her husband and his accomplice for the murder. The court acquitted the victim’s husband, Ajay Giri, a resident of Baterla village in Sector 41, and his accomplice Dharampal, a resident of Bapu Dham Colony, after the prosecution case fell flat in the court. Both of them were acquitted of the charges under Sections 302, 201 and 120-B of the IPC. The murder took place on October 29, 2012. Mamta Devi's body was found in the forest area near Sector 38 (West) with her throat slit. The prosecution had stated that her husband Ajay Giri had disfigured her face with a stone. According to the prosecution theory, accused Ajay suspected that his wife had illicit relations with someone and thus planned to kill her. He hired his close friend Dharampal for executing the murder for Rs 20,000. On the day of the murder, Ajay had asked his wife to accompany him to the market on the pretext of buying her a sari on the occasion of Karva Chauth. Ajay, who ran a tandoor at a rehri, took his wife on his bicycle near the gurdwara in Sector 38 (West) at 10 pm when he moved towards the forest area. His friend Dharampal was already waiting there in the jungle. As the couple reached there, Dharampal attacked Mamta Devi with a knife and slit her throat. Ajay picked a huge stone and smashed his wife’s face with it so that the body could not be identified, the police had said. The prosecution had stated that both accused came out of the jungle after killing her when a UT ASI spotted them with their clothes stained with blood. The policeman got suspicious and rounded them up. While he caught hold of Ajay, Dharampal managed to flee and was arrested later on. However, the ASI, who was the prime witness for the prosecution, stated to the court that when he reached the spot, the body had already been shifted in a vehicle by the police to be taken to the mortuary, said defence counsel Rabindera Pandit. “There were no independent witnesses in the case. The DNA report was not of much help and the ASI faltered in his statements before the court. It was also proved that he had a fight with the accused a few days prior to the murder. Ajay had himself gone to the police station to complain about his missing wife at the Sector 39 police station. The CCTV footage also could not be obtained from the police station making the case fall flat,” said advocate Pandit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T23:27:03.937+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
