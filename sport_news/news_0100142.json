But on Saturday, Kennesaw State nose tackle Nick Perrotta was also the center of attention. For the second time this season, the Lawrenceville native made an interception, and against Gardner-Webb on Saturday, it was a game winner. With the Bulldogs facing a fourth-and-goal with 7 seconds left, Perrotta dropped into coverage and intercepted a pass from Tyrell Maxwell on the goal line to seal the Owls’ 12-7 victory. “I guess I’ve been wearing the wrong jersey this whole time, because they keep throwing it to me,” Perrotta said, referring also to his interception against East Tennessee State, which he returned for a touchdown. “Coach (Brian)Newberry made the same call towards the end of the game a couple of plays in a row where it put me in a spot to just read the quarterback and drop into coverage.”As an interior lineman, the 6-foot, 253-pound junior is typically charged with stopping the opposing run game instead of passes, but both of those phases were a success for the Owls on Saturday. Perrotta and his fellow members of the defensive front seven held Gardner-Webb to just 35 yards rushing and three first downs through the first three quarters. The Bulldogs had also only converted one of seven third downs at that point. “I think it all goes back to our practice habits and what we do to prepare for a game,” Perrotta said. “Our coaches put us in all kinds of pressure situations. At the end of every practice, we do some kind of (offense versus defense) game-is-on-the line situation. I think putting us in that situation has given us an edge, being calm and collected in the moment, to be able to play defense well at the end of the game.”But after Maxwell led the visitors on a touchdown drive midway through the fourth quarter to close the deficit to 9-7, the pressure was on the Kennesaw State defense to get one more game-winning stop. “You want to talk about finding a way to win, when your back is against the wall?” Kennesaw State coach Brian Bohannon said. “I can’t say enough good things about the way our kids responded.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:42:23.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
