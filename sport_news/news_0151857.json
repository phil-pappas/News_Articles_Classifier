He’s been on the field for four pass plays, according to Pro Football Focus, and has caught one pass for one yard.\nThat could change Sunday in Denver with receivers Charles Johnson (rib) and Jarius Wright (hand) banged up. That would leave Patterson as one of only four healthy receivers at game time.\n“I think he has an opportunity [this week], yeah,” Zimmer said today.\nIs he ready for this opportunity? After all, Patterson’s career offensively has been in a consistent free fall since he was benched in favor of Johnson during the season last year.\n“I think he’s been doing a good job all along,” Zimmer said. “He just has to go out there and do it. There may be some opportunities for his this week. We’ll see.”\nWe’ll update the injury situation when the injury report comes out soon.\nSome other highlights from Zimmer’s press conference earlier today …\n— On whether he’ll bring the team out earlier Sunday to get used to the higher elevation: “No. Nope. We don’t even know if there’s altitude out there. It’s 7,200 feet is where you get affected. They’re at 5,200.”\n— On whether he has looked into the science of high elevations: “We have.”\n— On whether he’s seen growth in the development of second-year safety Antone Exum, who might see more playing time on Sunday: “It’s still an ongoing process. The communication, the recognition. It’s really that. It’s not the physical things.”\n— On what effect it would have if injured receivers Charles Johnson (rib) and Jarius Wright (hand) play on Sunday without a full week of practice: “I don’t think there will be any. I mean these guys have been running the offense for a long time. They’re smart guys. They’ll know what to do.”\n— On how the week of preparation was affected by the Broncos signing left tackle Tyler Polumbus this week. Polumbus might even start in place of Ty Sambrailo, who missed practice on Wednesday and Thursday because of a shoulder injury: “It adds a little bit. But they kind of do what they do. The protection is not going to change much with him. You get a lot more what-ifs. What if they do this? What if they do whatever? We went and got film on [Polumbus]. It’s partly scheme. Do they protect him this way or that way? It’s just what coaches do. The what-ifs. We always what-if everything anyway.”\n— On whether Matt Asiata might get more snaps because of how well he’s doing in pass protection: “Every situation and game is different. Adrian [Peterson] is our guy, so we’re going to continue to keep riding him.”\nOlder Post Getting to know the Broncos with ESPN reporter Jeff Legwold", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:33:02.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
