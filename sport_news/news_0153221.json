Prices made a record one-month jump of almost 32 percent in June, to $2.57 a dozen, when worries surrounding bird flu peaked. They've increased 15 percent since then, and 52 percent since the 2015 low of $1.96 a dozen in May.\nBut prices may see some relief soon, according to Rick Brown, senior vice president of commodity market analysis firm Urner Barry. He said he expects prices to decline before year's end as farmers start to repopulate the nearly 50 million birds that were killed amid avian flu worries. When bird flu concerns heightened this summer, the U.S. also starting importing more eggs from Europe and Mexico, which is keeping price increases from getting even worse.\n\"We've reached the point where the price is starting to flow down,\" he said.\nDemand typically increases around the holidays as the weather gets colder, people bake more and consumption rises. This year though, demand may not rise as much as in previous years because high prices are leading consumers to buy fewer eggs, he said.\nHigher prices are prompting some food manufacturers to use more egg substitutes and fewer whole eggs, Brown said.\n\"They're not really in any hurry to go back to eggs ahead of fall migration,\" when birds that carry the disease move south and spread it to farm chickens, he said. \"The industry has spent millions of dollars to ensure this doesn't happen.\"\nThe USDA said Wednesday that it estimates a half-billion dollars has already been spent trying to eradicate the flu from U.S. farms.\n\"The worst is behind us, provided we don't have another outbreak,\" Brown said.\nThe consumer price index for food increased 0.4 percent in September, its largest increase since May of last year, according to the Labor Department. The consumer price index for the 12 months ending in September was virtually unchanged from August, as a steep decline in energy prices offset the increase in food and a catchall category that includes everything from cars to clothing and medical care.\nsbomkamp@tribpub.com\nTwitter @samwilltravel\n Bird Flu Business", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561fc704/turbine/ct-consumer-prices-eggs-1016-biz-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-16T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:13:28.098+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
