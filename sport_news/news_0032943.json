(Photo: Kellie Stewart, Getty Images/iStockphoto) \nA string of chilly, damp and dark mornings have dented my will to get out and take some early bike rides. \nThat bothers me, because riding a bike gives me a spiritual and emotional lift, helping me shed some of the more ponderous aspects of life. On a bike, I feel young, as if the very act of pedaling spins away the rubbish of the soul that accumulates with age. \nIt comes with a caveat, however. The weather needs to cooperate. I don't need blue skies and temps in the 70s, but I abhor cycling in the rain, especially the kinds of rain we get this time of year, which announce the pending winter with chills that burrow into joints. \nFortunately, there is running, which offers a less-hateful foul weather exercise alternative. Running in cold, soggy weather sucks, but it sucks less than biking in cold, soggy weather. \nLike cycling, running works on my spirit in positive ways, but its effects come to me through a divergent route. Biking brings out the kid in me. Running makes me feel old and heavy. Biking helps me lie to myself. Running forces me to face the truth. \nThe payoff from running, especially in foul weather, comes after it's done. (It's like that old joke about wearing tight shoes. Why would you do it? Because it feels so good when you take them off.) I took a good solid run in a cold mist the other morning. When I finished and sat down in an easy rocking chair and let my heart relax and my breathing slow, I felt as if I were floating. \nI love both biking and running. But there's a constant tension between the two because I can't muster enough energy to be good at both at the same time. If I want to be a proficient runner, biking suffers. And vice versa. In the summer, I'll use races or events to determine where my focus will be. Is there a 10K coming up? I'll be a runner who likes to bike the weeks before. Do I want to explore the back roads of central Wisconsin? I'll spend more time in the saddle. \nIt's a delicate balance, hard enough to maintain during good weather. Then winter comes along, and messes everything up. It's not that I can't ride bike in the winter. It's that it's not easy. It's easier to run. \nThis year, though, I vow to maintain my cycling fitness some way or another through the dark season. I've said this before. But I mean it this time. \nI've said that before, too, but I really do mean it this time. \nAlthough I'm steadfastly refusing to buy one of those ugly big-tired bikes designed just for winter riding, I've got plenty of other equipment to help me. Good boots. A strong headlight and an eye-catching taillight. A new helmet with ear-flappy thingys on it to help keep my lobes warm. I'm even considering buying lugged winter tires. \nBring it on, winter. Just don't get too cold, OK?
