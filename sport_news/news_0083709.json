Chase Utley is a distant memory for the Mets as they march into Chicago up 2-0 on the Cubs in the NLCS.\nBut while the Dodgers are out of the playoffs, thanks to the Mets' Game 5 NLDS clinching win last week, Utley still has the matter of his appeal of the two-game ban he received for his takeout slide of Ruben Tejada in Game 2 of the divisional series that was played at Dodger Stadium.\nAlthough the hearing was scheduled for Monday in New York, the Daily News has learned that Utley's appeal will be heard at a later date. Should the second baseman lose his appeal, he would serve the two-game ban at the start of the 2016 season.\nLIVE BLOG: FOLLOW THE METS-CUBS NLCS HERE\nUtley barreled into Tejada as the Mets' shortstop took a relay throw from Daniel Murphy with his back to first base. The slide was well away from second base, and Tejada was upended and broke his right fibula as a result. The Dodgers won Game 2 but ultimately lost the series in five games. Utley was lustily booed at Citi Field during pre-game introductions when the series shifted to Flushing.\nJoe Torre, Major League Baseball's chief discipline czar, issued the ban for Games 3 and 4 of the NLDS, but Utley appealed, allowing him to be in uniform while the appeals process played out. Utley didn't play in the two games at Citi Field, but was a pinch hitter in the Game 5 Mets' win.\nWhen the hearing does eventually occur, it will be before John McHale Jr., MLB's Executive VP of Administration.\nRelated Stories Mets still do not plan to bring Daniel Murphy back: sources Harper: Noah Syndergaard shows how far he's come Could Mets let playoff hero Murphy walk?
