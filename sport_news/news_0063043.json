The Karachi-born Mahmood, who helped Pakistan reach the Bermuda Bowl final during the 1981 World championships in USA, is known for his passion towards bridge and the flamboyance with which he conducts himself. \"I have been playing this sport for well over four decades now. It has given me a lot of love, respect, fame and helped me see the world,\" the 69-year-old told TOI on the sidelines of the world championship that got over on Saturday.\n\"Trust me, winning the tournament is great, but being here means much more,\" says Mahmood, who considers India his second home. \"I love India! I miss this place and hate the fact that it takes three months for me to get a visa to come here. I love the fact that each time I am here -- people treat me like their brother. I really wish our politicians and law-makers throw away the barriers,\" says Mahmood, who shuttles between his 'home' in England and the United States.\nInterestingly, Zia was a late starter in the sport. \"I started playing bridge when I was about 22 or 23 years old. I thought bridge would help me to be in the company of beautiful women and it surely did,\" Zia, said, laughing.\nAmong the numerous anecdotes up his sleeve, Mahmood instantly recalls one -- many years ago -- during a bridge game alongside the legendary actor Omar Sharif when a beautiful lady joined in. \"We had a great evening of bridge and when time came to leave -- the woman went her way. Omar was disappointed and vented his frustration by going to a Casino, and went on a gambling spree. He made $1.1 million that night. Next day, Omar realized had it not been for that woman, he wouldn't have gone to the casino and won so much. So, Omar ordered flowers worth a $100,000 and had those sent to her,\" recalled Zia.\nThe qualified chartered accountant, who is based out of London, is proud of the camaraderie he shares with former Pakistan president Pervez Musharraf and other sportsmen from his country of birth. \"He had invited me to come to Pakistan to receive a special medal for promoting bridge there some years ago. I agreed, and even played a game with him. I have had the opportunity to interact with cricketers such as Imran Khan and Wasim Akram and must say they were great ambassadors of the game,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:47:30.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
