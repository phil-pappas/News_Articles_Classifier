Weber improved to 3-3 overall and 2-1 in the league with its first win in Missoula since 1987.\nWeber State plays host to North Dakota on Saturday at Stewart Stadium. North Dakota is 4-2 overall and 2-1 in the Big Sky, but it comes off a 37-31 loss to Idaho State.\n\"They can run it and they have a very good defense,\" Weber State coach Jay Hill said. \"… We're going to have to play our best game against them.\"\n  The Wildcats played one of their best games against Montana, after committing six turnovers in the home loss to Southern Utah.\n\"Obviously I'm happy with the way our team responded,\" Hill said. \"… We matched their physicality and, bottom line, we were able to run the ball. We were able to have some drives.\"\nAccording to Hill, the balance in the Big Sky is evident every week.\n\"Anybody in the conference can beat anybody else,\" he said. \" … The teams that are considered at the bottom are still very good football teams [and] if you turn the ball over six times like we did against Southern Utah, you're not going to like the result. It's all based on how you execute.\"\nluhm@sltrib.com Twitter: @sluhm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:55:25.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
