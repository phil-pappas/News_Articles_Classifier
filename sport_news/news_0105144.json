Downer Place in Aurora and journeyed into neighborhoods near the downtown before returning to the church for a light lunch and a chance for participants to offer reflections on their experience.\nOrganizer Veva Walton, a member of Our Savior Lutheran, said unlike other peace walks that she has participated in over the years, this one was designed for everyone – from babies in strollers to seniors.\n\"The third Saturday in October is always National Make a Difference Day and we wanted to do something that everybody could be a part of,\" Walton said. \"We wanted there to be a peace walk for the people of Aurora. To me, the best outcome would be for participants to become people of good will who breed peace.\"\nWalton said she thought Saturday's mid-morning rain kept some participants away, and the walk was scaled down as participants were limited to parents and small children, who colored peace signs in the church before embarking on their walk.\nRick Guzman, who works as assistant chief of staff in the Aurora mayor's office, said he told Mayor Tom Weisner he wanted to bring his family to be a part of the walk, which he said blended nicely with the city's \"Roots Aurora\" program that has been going on locally.\n\"We've been involved in a partnership with the 'Roots' group this month, and are working to bring people of different cultures together because we know there is strength in numbers,\" Guzman said. \"We have strength in our diversity as a city, and this walk is another opportunity - a window into other cultures.\"\nBrittany Tripp of Aurora brought her two children Parker, 5, and Caroline, 10 months, along for the walk. Tripp said even though all problems couldn't be solved by a simple walk – a positive message was still being sent out.\n\"The way I see it is we need to create a space for peace,\" she said. \"We can't always take away the negative, but we can put a more positive message out there that is still impactful on people.\"\nRicky Rodgers, who said he has lived in Aurora since 1983, serves on the advisory board of the African-American Heritage group. Rodgers said despite the threat of rain he wanted to come \"because if it's not in your heart – you'll always find a reason not to do something.\"\n\"It's important for youth to see the leaders in the community working together in cohesion,\" he said. \"If we're not seen working together, how can we expect kids to grow up and do it? We need to put aside the problems of the neighborhood, religion and what have you and solve the problems of the community. Peace in the streets creates unity across communities.\"\nChurch staff members including Nichole Scarpino, who serves as the children's ministry director, said being in a large community offers opportunities to care for one's neighbors.\n\"Jesus calls us to do that, and a peace walk is an extension of it,\" Scarpino said. \"It's a way for the community to get to know one another and not be polarized.\"\nDavid Sharos is a freelance reporter for The Beacon-News.\nCopyright © 2015, Aurora Beacon-News Aurora", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562c23f8/turbine/ct-abn-aurora-peace-walk-st-1025-20151024"], "published": "2015-10-25T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:39:24.392+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
