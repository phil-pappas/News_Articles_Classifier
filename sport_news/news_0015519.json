Going purely by the points currently, Killingly has the best chance to be playing after Thanksgiving. The Redmen are No. 4 in Class M with their 4-1 mark. This week’s game versus New London will be a litmus test to determine just how far they have come. The Whalers may be having a tough season, but have always been difficult on the Redmen. New London has won all three of the games played between the two in the last three years. “This year, in this conference, it’s all about matchups. Some teams match up well with others,” said Killingly coach Chad Neal. Fitch and Montville could also pose stiff tests for Killingly. Ledyard is also in the mix in Class M with its 4-1 record. But both teams can ill afford to stumble. Class M has only two undefeated teams, Berlin and Foran, but 12 schools have one loss or less. The Colonels have back-to-back games with Montville and NFA (with Jawaun Johnson?) and also play Fitch on Thanksgiving. Bacon Academy, sitting in ninth spot, have to play well against Fitch this week and also have to worry about a game with NFA. Get through those two and the Bobcats could be on their way to a quarterfinal game. Fitch has three very difficult games with the three Class M contenders from the ECC and also has a game with Waterford. The Falcons are currently No. 10 in Class L. Windham and Montville are buried a bit in the Class S standings, sitting 12th and 16th respectively. The Whippets will get a much-needed boost as far as bonus points with a win over NFA this weekend. They also have a game against the Indians to play. Montville not only has Windham, but Killingly, Ledyard, Griswold and Waterford—all potential stumbling blocks. Norwich Free Academy, despite its two losses, is in 10th spot in Class LL, but still has a tough ECC schedule remaining with Windham, Ledyard and Bacon. Best bets right now: Killingly, Ledyard and Windham. Tough choice I can understand the reluctance of NFA to join the Southern Connecticut Conference in football only without Ledyard, Fitch, East Lyme and New London. From all I’ve heard, NFA, East Lyme and Ledyard were ready to move forward, but Fitch and New London were not on board and the SCC athletic directors sensed that when the two sides first met. Without the Falcons and Whalers, the SCC was only prepared to accept one additional school to bring itself to an even 20. Page 2 of 2 - It’s also why I believe the district model that some are in favor of likely won’t take place any time soon. There is something to regional competition that is hard to replace. Although NFA athletic director Eric Swallow realizes for his football program to move forward, it has to play more than one LL school each year, he also realizes that the absence of local rivals is not good. Had the Wildcats jumped to the SCC, they would have played eight or nine games against competition from outside the area. The New London Thanksgiving Day game could have been preserved, but that was about all. With the reduced ECC schedule — NFA is only guaranteed six games by the league — it’s possible the Wildcats may be able to pick up a couple of additional games against larger programs. Quotables “I look up there and see Ferrigno Field (on the Windham scoreboard) and I think of The Hulk,” — Killingly senior Vasileios Politis on playing at Windham High School where the football field is named after long-time coach and athletic director Ed Ferrigno, not the actor Lou Ferrigno. “Take him out to dinner, keep him distracted, keep him off the sidelines,” — Windham coach Brian Crudden jokingly to Windham student activities coordinator Kathy Pekarovic in reference to former Killingly High football coach and Windham High principal, Gene Blain, who was on hand in his capacity as Killingly athletic director. On the air 6:15 p.m., WINY (1350 AM): New London at Killingly. 6:15 p.m., WJJF (94.9 FM): Montville at Ledyard.
