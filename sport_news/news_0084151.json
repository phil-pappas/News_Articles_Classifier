Pleasant News \nWAYLAND — WACO football put on a show Friday night at home against Cardinal. The Warriors ran for over 300 yards on offense and forced six turnovers on defense in a 47-14 drubbing of Cardinal. \nThe Warriors got things started with two touchdowns in the first quarter, both by Bryce Achen. Achen’s first score was on a 19-yard pass from Jackson Roth, and the second was a two-yard run. The extra-point opportunities were missed after both occasions, but WACO held a 12-0 lead after the first period. \nIn the second, it was Achen again with a 14-yard run to put the Warriors up 19-0. The ensuing kickoff, however, was taken back 92 yards by Cardinal’s Marcus Olson, who raced into the end zone for the Comets’ first score to make it 19-7. Gabe Black punched in a one-yard touchdown run later in the second and the Wolves led 26-7 at halftime. \nThe rushing onslaught continued in the third quarter, and it was Black and Achen who continued to lead the way. Black made it 33-7 with a one-yard run to start the second half scoring, and Achen punched in a three-yard run later in the quarter for his fourth score of the game to push the lead to 40-7. \nIn the fourth quarter, Jorge Chacon got on the board with a three-yard touchdown run to make it 47-7, before the Comets scored once more on an 87-yard touchdown run by Olson to end the scoring at 47-14. \nAchen finished the game with 20 rushing attempts for 162 yards and three touchdowns, to go along with his one catch for a 19-yard touchdown. Black had 13 carries and ran for 68 yards and two touchdowns. He also had one catch that went for six yards. \nRoth went 9-21 passing in the game with 108 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. Colton Horak attempted and completed one pass for 26 yards. Jackson Gerot and Justyn Chalupa had three catches apiece. Gerot finished with 59 yards, and Chalupa had 45. \nGerot led the Wolves in tackles, with five, including one sack. The Wolves picked off four passes in the game, one each by Achen, Chacon, Chalupa and Horak. Chalupa also had one fumble recovery, as did Colton Wilson. \nThe Warriors moved to 3-2 on the year and are looking like a solid playoff contender at 3-0 in the district. WACO could all but wrap up a playoff spot this Friday, if they can pull off a road win at Lone Tree. The Lions are 3-2 overall and 2-1 in the district.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T20:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:31:30.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
