Copeland Trophies, five All Australian selections and two Anzac Day medals. \n“The direction the club is taking really excites me. We have a solid group of young players who have got a taste of senior footy and we have the right program and people in place to take this group to the next level,” Pendlebury said. \n“I’m proud to captain this club and want to be part of what the future holds.” \nCollingwood finished in 12th place this season with only 10 wins.
