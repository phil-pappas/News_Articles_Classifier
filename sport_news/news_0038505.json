McCarney was fired following a setback that UNT athletic director Rick Villarreal said was an indication of how far the program had fallen since a win over UNLV in the 2013 Heart of Dallas Bowl.\nThe Mean Green's loss to Portland State was its sixth straight dating to last season. It was also also UNT's first loss to a team competing on the Football Championship Subdivision since the school resumed playing on the Football Bowl Subdivision level in 1995.\nUNT was 8-0 against FCS teams since that season, a streak the Mean Green never came close to extending against Portland State.\n\"When you come up short on the scoreboard and are off to the start we are this season, it's disheartening and disappointing because I see how hard everyone works,\" McCarney said.\nThe Vikings came into the night ranked 25th on the FCS level and upset Washington State earlier in the year.\nThere was never much of a question that Portland State would make UNT its second FBS victim of the year.\nThe Mean Green were never really competitive against the Vikings and fell to 0-5 for the first time since 2008.\nThe Vikings (4-1) certainly looked the part while dismantling the Mean Green. Portland State rolled up a whopping 670 total yards and held UNT scoreless until the Mean Green scored a meaningless touchdown on a pass from backup quarterback DaMarcus Smith to wide receiver Carlos Harris with 1:02 left.\nAlex Kuresa threw for 269 yards and three touchdowns on just 19 attempts, while David Jones rushed for 134 yards and two touchdowns on nine carries. Andrew McNulty threw for 57 yards and Carlos Harris added 57 receiving yards for the Mean Green.\nPortland State at North Texas\nClick here to visit the Mean Green blog\nPrediction: UNT will pull through on homecoming\nFive things UNT fans should know about Portland State\nKindness of UNT community helps grieving player make it to football game\nUNT sticking with McNulty at quarterback\nBest in Texas (10/5): Baylor, TCU in fight for top spot; Houston gains ground on Texas Tech\nBest in Texas breakdown (10/5): Longhorns well behind in-state rivals; SMU remains a mystery\nOn Twitter:\n @brettvito", "external_links": ["http://meangreenblog.dentonrc.com/", "http://meangreenblog.dentonrc.com/2015/10/prediction-unt-will-pull-through-on-homecoming.html/", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/04/best-texas-105-baylor-tcu-fight-top-spot-houston-gains-ground-texas-tech", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/10/north-texas-dan-mccarney-relieved-duties-following-mean-greens-66-7-loss-fcs-school", "http://meangreenblog.dentonrc.com/2015/10/five-quick-thoughts-6.html/", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/07/kindness-unt-community-helps-grieving-player-make-football-game", "https://twitter.com/brettvito", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/05/unt-sticking-mcnulty-quarterback", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/04/best-texas-breakdown-105-longhorns-behind-state-rivals-smu-remains-mystery", "http://meangreenblog.dentonrc.com/2015/10/five-things-unt-fans-should-know-about-portland-state.html/"], "published": "2015-10-08T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:26:34.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
