Of those eight, four are still in action. Of those four, the Saints have played and lost to three this season.\nSunday they face the fourth in the Eagles' Sam Bradford.\nBradford is one of the two significant changes on the Eaglesâ€™ offense who has yet to make a significant improvement. He was sacked five times and hit eight times by the Redskins in last week's loss. Playing behind a banged-up offensive line hasn't helped.\nPlaying without the benefit of a running game hasn't either.\nDemarco Murray's under-utilization and ineffectiveness in the ground attack is baffling, especially to him. The NFL's leading rusher a year ago as a cowboy has carried just 29 times this season for 47 yards. On 28 of those 29 carries he's averaged less than one yard. The guy they brought to Philadelphia for 5 years and $40 million is on pace for a 188 yard, four touchdown rushing season.\nHead coach Chip Kelly has been pilloried this week for an offense that ranks near the bottom of the NFL in practically every category.\nFor the first time the Saints will be facing two former teammates in safety Malcolm Jenkins and running back/punt returner Darren Sproles. They rank as two of the most significant losses to the Saints in the Sean Payton era and hope to under-score that perception with their performances Sunday.\nSproles will be returning Brandon Fields' first punt as a Saint. He's brought back 3 for touchdowns in his two years as an Eagle. And with each kicker -- Caleb Sturgis of Philadelphia and Zach Hocker of New Orleans -- missing chip-short field goals last week, the kicking game this week could be pivotal to the outcome.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
