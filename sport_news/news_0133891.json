From what they've been able to exhibit for these past days is a true manifestation that yes, when you opportunities to any Ghanaian, he will definitely excel,' the Black Stars chief added full of confidence. \nThe friendly match will kick off at 7:00pm local time (11:00pm GMT) and you can follow the game live right here on Allsports.com.gh.
