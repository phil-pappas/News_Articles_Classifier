He rushed for a career-high 166 yards and one touchdown on 29 carries, and repeatedly pounded the Miami defense with second- and third-effort running. He also benefited from excellent blocking by the offensive line.\nCostly mistakes \nBack-to-back pass-interference penalties on Jets CB Darrelle Revis and S Marcus Gilchrist provided 58 of the 88 yards on Miami’s first TD \"drive.\" … Jets RG Brian Winters’ holding penalty wiped out an Ivory run for a first down in the fourth quarter, and the Jets soon were forced to punt on that series. … Miami rookie WR DeVante Parker was flagged for offensive pass interference, negating Ryan Tannehill’s 2-yard TD pass to Jarvis Landry that would have cut Miami’s deficit to one score in the fourth quarter.\nEye-catching \nWR Eric Decker, who returned to action after sitting out last week’s game with a knee injury, made a brilliant catch of a second-quarter Ryan Fitzpatrick pass for a 26-yard gain that led to a Nick Folk field goal. Decker flagged the ball down with his left hand and then used his right hand to help gather it in. … Controversial Miami NT Ndamukong Suh kicked Fitzpatrick in the head and knocked his helmet off after a first-half scramble by the Jets QB, who was on the ground at the time, but officials ruled it was inadvertent. Suh appeared to be trying to avoid colliding with a teammate. … Miami WR Kenny Stills inexplicably failed to step out of bounds after a long reception late in the game, costing his team 20-plus seconds.\nCoaching decisions \nMiami coach Joe Philbin and members of his staff are on the hot seat, and it wasn’t hard to see why. Offensive coordinator Bill Lazor made some curious calls, including not ordering any running plays after the Dolphins got a first down at the Jets’ 4 with more than six minutes remaining. And while Lazor certainly was hampered by the absence of injured LT Branden Albert in facing the Jets’ myriad of blitzes, he didn’t make the proper adjustments in altering the pass routes he called.\nLooking ahead \nThe Jets, who are 3-1 for the first time since 2010, will have their bye week before facing Washington at home on Oct. 18. The Jets haven’t had a bye this early since they had it after the fourth week during the 2008 season. Washington rallied to beat Philadelphia on Sunday, evening its record at 2-2. The Redskins will visit Atlanta next Sunday.\n— J.P. Pelzman", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:44:08.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
