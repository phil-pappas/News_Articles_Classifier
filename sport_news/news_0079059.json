The United States has condemned attacks on Israeli civilians and called for a return to calm .\nThe Palestinian envoy said the UN office of legal affairs had produced a 44-page report detailing options for the protection of Palestinians, but that the Security Council had yet to consult it .\nIsrael set up checkpoints Wednesday in Palestinian neighborhoods of the occupied east Jerusalem and mobilized hundreds of soldiers as it struggled to stop attacks .\nMansour called the checkpoints \"collective punishment\" and said 30 Palestinians have been killed in the recent violence, including seven children .\nBan has urged Israel to carry out a \"serious review\" of whether its security forces are resorting to excessive force in clashes with Palestinians .\nThe crisis started in late July when 18-month-old toddler Ali Saad Dawabsha was burned to death and three other Palestinians were severely injured after their house in the occupied West Bank was set on fire by Israeli settlers.\nThe settlers smashed the windows of two homes in the village of Duma near Nablus and threw Molotov cocktails inside the buildings. Dawabsha died after sustaining serious burns.\nThe parents of the toddler, Riham and Saad, and their other son Ahmad lost their lives after suffering serious injuries as a result of the attack.\n*This story was edited by Ahram Online.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:13:25.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
