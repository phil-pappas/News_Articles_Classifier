Quarterback Paxton Lynch had a huge game, throwing for a career-high 442 yards and four touchdowns to lead the Tigers. Running backs Doroland Dorceus and Jamarius Henderson both rushed for over 100 yards and two touchdowns each. \nTulsa kept it close early, and had a Hail Mary to end the first half to keep it to a 14-point halftime deficit. However, Memphis' offense was just too much for the Golden Hurricane as the Tigers ran away with it in the second half. \nMemphis compiled 704 total yards of offense in an explosive performance as they remained unbeaten at 7-0. Tulsa's offense was excellent -- 42 points and 532 total yards is nothing to sneeze at -- but the defense never found an answer for Lynch and the Memphis offense. \nThe Tigers are now on a collision course with Houston on Nov. 14 in a matchup that has huge American Athletic Conference title implications, and may serve as a play-in game for the Group of Five spot in the New Year's Six bowl games. Paxton Lynch had another monster performance for Memphis on Friday.
