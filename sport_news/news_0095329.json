(By: MARK STALLINGS) (Credit: Special to the NWA Democrat-Gazette) \nThe Bulldogs shut down a potent Bryant offense, pulling away in the second half for a 38-7 victory at Smith-Robinson Stadium. \nGreenwood 38, Bryant 7 \nBryant^7^0^0^0^—^7 \nGreenwood^3^14^14^7^—^38 \nFirst Quarter \nBryant — Kelly 23 from Burks (Ray kick), 9:01. \nGreenwood — Cooper 24 field goal, 5:42. \nSecond Quarter \nGreenwood — Martin 3 run (Cooper kick), 7:10. \nGreenwood — Martin 4 run (Cooper kick), 1:05. \nThird Quarter \nGreenwood — Martin 8 run (Cooper kick), 10:44. \nGreenwood — Hood 4 run (Cooper kick), 1:24. \nFourth Quarter \nGreenwood — Hood 4 run (Cooper kick), 9:03. \nGreenwood (7-0, 4-0 7A/6A-Central) are now 6-0 against Class 7A teams this season with at game at War Memorial Stadium against Little Rock Catholic in two weeks for a seventh. But a more important game looms next week when the Bulldogs host Siloam Springs, with a win clinching a berth into the Class 6A playoffs. \n\"It was good win for us,\" Greenwood coach Rick Jones said. \"I thought we played hard in all three phases. I challenge both the offense and defense lines to not take step back. I wanted them moving forward and never go backward.\" \nThe Bulldog defense limited Bryant to just 249 total yards and 12 first downs. The Hornets had the conference's leading rushing attack coming into the night, but had just 128 yards in the game. \n\"I cannot say enough about our defense because Bryant is so scary offensively,\" Jones said. \"They do so many things well. They are down to their third tailback. Still, they are so fast and the quarterback can run and throw.\" \nAfter struggling through much of the first half, Greenwood did finish the game with 501 total yards, including 392 yards on the ground. Caden Martin and Daylon Hood, usually backup running backs, shone as each gained more than 100 yards rushing and combined for five touchdowns. \n\"Our line blocked well up front, but our receivers were blocking downfield as well,\" Jones said. \"I thought we executed very well. We got physical with them and tried to play very fast. \n\"We like to think that if an opponent takes away the pass, then we will run it. The key is to be good enough to run or pass even when they know what is coming. We did that (running the ball) in the second half.\" \nGreenwood held Bryant to just three first downs and 102 total yards in the first half, 77 of which came on two passes on the Hornets' touchdown drive early in the first quarter. The Bulldogs limited the Hornets to just 25 rushing yards on 13 carries in the first half. \n\"It takes a lot of preparation to get ready for (Bryant),\" Jones said. \"We stopped counting at 96 different formations and then they come out in something different in three separate plays early. We made a few adjustments after that.\" \nQuarterback Gunnar Burns hit Austin Kelly for a 54-yard pass, then again on the next play for a 23-yard touchdown to give Bryant a 7-0 lead with 9:01 in the first quarter. \nGreenwood took control of the game in the second quarter thanks to a pair of Caden Martin touchdown to open up a 17-3 halftime lead. \nThe Bulldogs then completely dominated the second half, scoring on their first three possessions of the second half to blow the game open. \nDespite the loss, the Hornets can still clinch a 7A playoff berth when they return home next week to face Van Buren. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:00:46.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
