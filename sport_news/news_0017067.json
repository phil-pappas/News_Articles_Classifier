(AP Photo/Bill Kostroun, File) \nNEW YORK (AP) — For New Yorkers who happen to be fans of the Jets, Mets and Rangers, a wild and rare Sunday awaits. \nAll three teams will be playing at home on the same day for just the second time, according to STATS. The Rangers will entertain New Jersey, the Jets are home for the Washington Redskins and the Mets will host Game 2 of the NL Championship Series against the Chicago Cubs. \nThe only other instance of all three teams being home on the same day was 16 years ago Saturday — Oct. 17, 1999. The Jets were beaten by Peyton Manning and the Indianapolis Colts 16-13, the Rangers topped the Atlanta Thrashers 4-1 and the Mets needed 15 innings to beat the Atlanta Braves 4-3 in Game 5 of the NLCS.
