We really lost a good one. Fly high homie üôèüèæ R.I.P. Altee Tenpenny ‚Äî Kenyan Drake‚Ñ¢ (@KDx17) October 21, 2015 \nAlabama junior offensive guard Alphonse Taylor tweeted an emotional reaction to the news as well. He has a picture of Tenpenny running the ball as the backdrop photo on his Twitter page. RIP big Cuz Rodrick Lucy &#10;RIP Altee Tenpenny &#10;y God take yall from me the same night or why he took yall from me at all I dont understand üôèüèæ ‚Äî Alphonse Taylor (@SHANKK50) October 21, 2015 \nAuburn sophomore defensive end Carl Lawson also shared his condolences. R.I.P. Altee Tenpenny ‚Äî carl lawson (@carllawson14) October 21, 2015 \nA four-star recruit, Tenpenny spent two seasons at Alabama where he rushed for just 218 yards and a touchdown, but transferred to UNLV after the 2014 season. He was dismissed from UNLV in August for breaking teams rules. \nThe North Little Rock, Ark., native wound up at FCS school Nicholls State, but was dismissed after being arrested Sunday for possession of a firearm and discharging a weapon. Two days later, Tenpenny died in a one-vehicle car accident in which he was thrown from the vehicle in Mississippi while heading back to Arkansas from Nicholls State. \n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with Altee and his family,\" Alabama coach Nick Saban said on this morning's SEC coaches' call. \"This is obviously a tragedy. This was a guy that was in our program and good friends with a lot of our players. We want to be as supportive as possible with all the people who are affected by this.\" \nWhen you look at Seattle Seahawks running back Fred Jackson surviving a car accident and seeing Tenpenny lose his life in his, it just shows how fortunate and how fragile life is. #RIP Altee Tenpenny!
