Watford had some good chances early on, but Petr Cech was equal to them and Alexis Sanchez broke the deadlock with a strike in the 62nd minute after good work from Mesut Ozil saw the ball fall kindly to him.\nOzil then put the ball on a plate for substitute Olivier Giroud to slot home just five minutes later and Aaron Ramsey's effort made it 3-0 in the 74th minute. \n[PHOTO]http://img.modernghana.com/images/content/Liverpool made a bright start, and they might well have had the lead when Divock Origi headed against the crossbar. \nHowever, Tottenham battled back, and substitute Clinton Njie -- on for the injured Nacer Chadli -- brought a good save from Simon Mignolet just before the half-hour mark before Harry Kane and Dele Alli went close in quick succession. \nThe second half brought far fewer chances at both ends, although Kane came close in the 84th minute when his low drive brought a good save from Mignolet, while Emre Can fired just wide shortly before the final whistle. \n[PHOTO]http://img.modernghana.com/images/content/Leicester, who began the day with 15 points from their opening eight games, fell behind on 21 minutes when Southampton centre-back Jose Fonte headed home. \nFonte's centre-back partner, Virgil van Dijk, doubled their lead before the break, scoring from the follow-up after Graziano Pelle's header had struck the post. \nVardy, the Premier League's leading scorer this season, reduced the deficit on 66 minutes after good work from Nathan Dyer and then produced a fine finish in injury time to secure a share of the spoils. \nSam Allardyce could not bring about an improvement in Sunderland's fortunes as they lost 1-0 at West Bromwich Albion in his first match in charge. \nSaido Berahino gave West Brom the lead on 54 minutes, tapping into the net after Sunderland keeper Costel Pantilimon failed to claim a cross from Chris Brunt. \nThat proved the only goal of the game as Sunderland remain locked in the relegation zone. \nWest Ham United scored two late goals to see off 10-man Crystal Palace 3-1 at Selhurst Park. \nCarl Jenkinson gave West Ham the lead, poking a shot past Wayne Hennessey on 22 minutes, but moments later the Arsenal loanee gave away a penalty for a foul on Dwight Gayle. \nYohan Cabaye restored parity from the spot, despite being ordered to retake the penalty, but the Eagles' hopes of claiming a positive result suffered a setback when Gayle picked up a second booking just before the break. \nThat proved costly as Manuel Lanzini fired West Ham into the lead in the 88th minute before Dimitri Payet added a third deep into injury time. \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
