We can’t take him too lightly because obviously he’s proven for a long period of time that he’s capable of causing havoc with the ball in hand,” Moa said. \nMoa enjoyed catching up this week at a Kiwis team dinner with Lauiti’iti, who has played the past four seasons for Wakefield Trinity. \nThe pair locked horns on several occasions in England when Moa played four seasons for Hull FC before shifting to Sydney in 2013. \n“Ali’s a legend over here for what he’s done. He’s paved the way for a lot of the Kiwis who have come over here.” \nNew Zealand will face a stiff task defending their unbeaten record against Leeds in 11 meetings dating back to 1907. \nLeeds have dominated the Super League in recent seasons and were recently crowned 2015 champions. \nThey will want to deliver a memorable farewell to three departing greats – their starting New Zealand prop Kylie Leuluai and former Great Britain stalwarts Jamie Peacock and Kevin Sinfield. \nThe teams haven’t met since 1993, while the game is New Zealand’s first against any British club team for 13 years. \nIt is the only hit-out ahead of the Kiwis’ three-Test series against England and Moa admits it will be very important for certain players. \nTuimoala Lolohea is one of four newcomers and will play at halfback while Pita Hiku is at stand-off, with the pair on a steep learning curve to fill the boots of injured pair Shaun Johnson and Kieran Foran. \nThey are both likely to start the first Test at Hull on November 1.
