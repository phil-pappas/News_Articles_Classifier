(AP) - Flat on his back on the Lambeau Field turf, Philip Rivers arched his neck up briefly before lying back down and flailing his arms. \nA milestone day for the San Diego quarterback ended in frustration. And defeat. \nRivers set career highs of 43 completions, 65 attempts and 503 yards passing, but the Chargers still lost 27-20 to the Green Bay Packers on Sunday. Rivers’ final pass was poked away near the end zone on fourth-and-goal at the 3 with 15 seconds left. \n“Brutal loss, obviously, losing the way we did,” coach Mike McCoy said. \nIt was a familiar feeling after San Diego (2-4) fell to Pittsburgh on the last play on Monday night. \nRivers walked to the microphone at his postgame news conference on Sunday and sighed. \n“Gosh, I don’t know. I just made a comment, ‘Hey, you’ve got to laugh to keep from crying,’” he said. “Another one, another one that’s tough.” \nRivers threw for two touchdowns. His 43 completions were the most in NFL history in a loss; he needed one more, at least. \nFirst-round draft pick Damarious Randall denied that as he lunged to poke away Rivers’ short pass to Danny Woodhead near the front right pylon in the final seconds. \nPackers fans erupted with a collective sigh of relief. Green Bay (6-0) survived its biggest scare of the year to stay unbeaten. \n“Biggest play of the game,” coach Mike McCarthy said. “Damarious is off to a great start.” \nThe Packers started strong and finished barely in front. Running back James Starks had touchdowns on a 65-yard run and a 5-yard pass in the first quarter. \nGreen Bay went up for good after Aaron Rodgers found James Jones for an 8-yard pass in the corner of the end zone for a 24-17 lead with 40 seconds left in the third quarter. The defense bent and allowed Josh Lambo’s 32-yard field goal with 11:14 left. \nThe stout pass rush finally caught up to Rivers in the second half. Datone Jones sacked Rivers on third-and-7 from the Packers 40 to end one drive. Until then, a Chargers line missing three starters held up well, with Rivers orchestrating a quick-strike offense and finding all the holes in the secondary. \nIt was the most porous outing of the year for the Packers’ defense.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T05:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:08:18.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
