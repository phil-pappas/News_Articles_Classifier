(AP Photo/Darron Cummings) (Darron Cummings) Comments \nJon Lester's postseason pedigree speaks for itself. \nOver nine seasons in Boston, he posted a 2.11 ERA with 68 strikeouts and 21 walks in 13 postseason games. Lester faltered in the American League wild card game for Oakland last season, but that was his only blip on an otherwise impressive playoffs resume. \nTonight, he's set to face former Red Sox teammate John Lackey as the Chicago Cubs take on the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 1 of the National League Division Series. \nThe Cubs, whose World Series drought is long-suffering and well-known, outbid the Red Sox and signed Lester to a healthy contract this offseason to help them end the drought. \nLester posted a 3.34 ERA in 32 starts posting 9.1 strikeouts per nine innings, his highest total in a full season since 2010. \nMeanwhile, Lackey, in his first full year since his trade to St. Louis at the deadline last year, had the best season of his career. He posted a career-low 2.77 ERA through 33 starts and threw his most innings (218) and strikeouts (175) since 2007. \nLester and Lackey faced each other back on July 6 in a pitcher's duel at Wrigley Field. \nLester allowed two runs on two hits while striking out eight over seven innings. Lackey threw seven scoreless innings allowing six hits and a walk while striking out four. Lester took the loss when the Cardinals won 6-0, but took salvage in the fact that he got his first career hit -- an infield single that ricocheted off Lackey's leg. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nThe 31-year-old Lester and 36-year-old Lackey should put on quite a show tonight in St. Louis. \nHere's a good post from Barry Srvluga of the Washington Post on the friendship Lester and Lackey formed in Boston. \nFollow MassLive.com Red Sox beat reporter @jcmccaffrey on Twitter.
