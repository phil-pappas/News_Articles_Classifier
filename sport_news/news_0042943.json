This is the final resting stop,” Tacopina told The Associated Press by phone after posing for pictures beside Venice’s Grand Canal, with gondolas in the background. “This is a big project. It’s a long-term project.” \nThe operation cost about 6 million euros ($6.7 million), Tacopina said. \nNew York sports lawyer John Goldman and finance manager John Tapinis joined Tacopina in announcing the deal. \nJames Daniels, the CEO of Connecticut-based High Ridge Brands, is also an investor. \n“John and John are on the board,” Tacopina said. “There are a couple of others who are partners but silent investors.” \nVenezia’s last appearance in Serie A came in 2001-02. The squad’s biggest title was the 1941 Italian Cup. \nThe club currently plays at the Pierluigi Penzo stadium on the island city. Tacopina has plans for a new 28,000-seat stadium on the mainland near the Marco Polo airport. Plans call for a basketball arena to be constructed next to the soccer stadium. \n“We’ve already had some of the biggest stadium engineers and architects from America at the site,” he said. “So it’s moving along.” \nVenezia has had a perfect start this season with six straight wins, 18 goals scored and three conceded. \nTacopina attributed the solid start to sporting director Giorgio Perinetti, who formerly worked at Juventus, Roma and Napoli. \n“He has put together a team that could compete in Serie B right now,” Tacopina said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:20:06.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
