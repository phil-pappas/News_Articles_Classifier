The general, who headed the elite force, was Compaore right-hand man during much of his 27-year rule.\nBurkina Faso was brought to the brink of chaos for six days before the coup collapsed when its leaders admitted they lacked popular support.\nThe presidential guard has since been disarmed and formally disbanded.\nAccording to government figures, 14 people were killed and 251 injured in the unrest.\nSangare also said that they had not ruled out prosecuting Compaore in connection with the murder of his iconic predecessor Thomas Sankara in 1987.\n\"For now, former president Compaore is not being pursued (in the Sankara case), but it is not ruled out that it could happen,\" he said.\nSankara, a revolutionary figure who is still a hero to many in west Africa, was killed in mysterious circumstances.\nA lawyer for his family said on Tuesday that an autopsy showed his remains had been riddled with bullets.\n\"There were more than a dozen all over the body, even below the armpits,\" Ambroise Farama said.
