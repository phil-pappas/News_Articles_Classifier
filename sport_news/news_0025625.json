He has a little hair that looks like a tornado, so I decided if I did it clockwise theyâ€™d do well, so I kept rubbing and they got a hit then another hit,\" Royals fan Jeff Patton told us.\nWe don't know how the dog felt about all the rubbing, but whatever works, right?\nOne of our Facebook friends is wearing her lucky Royals shirt, saying \"They've won every time I've had this on.\"\nOur digital content manager is.wearing special Royals garb too, though she wouldn't tell us what significance her shirt has because she afraid she would jinx things. Uh huh.\nOther fans take their superstitions to even greater heights. We found a local astrologist who's also a Royals fan.\nQuan Tracy Cherry studies supernatural forces and the Royals from time to time.\nCherry says the stars are aligned for a great pitching performance from Johnny Cueto as long as Cueto maintains his composure. (Pretty spot on).\n\"He has the need for physical control. So any distractions that get him out of what I call the 'jiggling rocking chair,' you have to go into that focused sense of keeping physical control of his own rhythm,\" Cherry said.\nUm, okay. By the way, Cherry was holding a tiger during the interview because Cueto was born in the year of the tiger.\nSo, wear your lucky hat, tee-shirt, or jersey, watch the game on the right television with the right people, and drink whatever you drink to bring home a Royals victory. Like we said, whatever works.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
