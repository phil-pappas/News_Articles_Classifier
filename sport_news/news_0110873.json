(AP) — Josh Rosen completed a school-record 34 passes and threw two of his three touchdown passes to Devin Fuller, and UCLA got its season back on track with a 40-24 victory over No. 20 California on Thursday night. \nRosen passed for 399 yards in another splendid game for the standout freshman, and Thomas Duarte had career highs of 10 catches for 141 yards for the Bruins (5-2, 2-2 Pac-12). UCLA rebounded from consecutive losses and a drop from the national rankings with a 573-yard offensive performance. \nSoso Jamabo rushed for a score after star UCLA tailback Paul Perkins left with an injury, and the Bruins' injury-plagued defense limited Jared Goff and Cal's potent offense to 170 yards in the first half. \nGoff passed for 295 yards in a second straight disappointing game for the Bears (5-2, 2-2). They have lost two straight. \nKenny Lawler, Darius Powe and Khalfani Muhammad caught TD passes for Cal, which entered the Rose Bowl with its highest ranking in six years and a chance to clinch to clinch bowl eligibility for the first time since 2011. Instead, the Bears still have just one win in Pasadena since 1999. \nNO. 22 TEMPLE 24, EAST CAROLINA 14 \nGREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) — P.J. Walker threw a late 23-yard touchdown pass to Robby Anderson, and Temple rallied to beat East Carolina. \nWalker finished 19 of 35 for 250 yards for the Owls (7-0, 4-0 American Athletic Conference). They ensured their first appearance in the Top 25 since 1979 — and the best start in school history — will last a little longer. \nEast Carolina's Blake Kemp was 31 of 48 for 272 yards with a 7-yard touchdown pass to Quay Johnson. Chris Hairston added a 1-yard scoring run for the Pirates (4-4, 2-2). \nTemple's Jahad Thomas rushed for two touchdowns, of 2 and 14 yards, the last sealing it with 2:18 to play. The American's leading rusher finished with just 66 yards — 60 fewer than his average. \nAP College Football site: www.collegefootball.ap.org ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:39:31.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
