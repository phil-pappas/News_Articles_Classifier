It accommodates an active cattle ranch carried on after the death of the ranch's venerable founder and owner, Tweet Kimball .\nBut the valuable links to the past that dot the 3,400-acre property go back much further than that. At least 55 million years further, according to more than 30 petrified logs whose location volunteers have recently pinpointed on the property.\nThe logs, partially buried but impressively intact, date back to Earth's Paleocene Epoch, according to researchers, and studying them is providing insights about the climate and environment of prehistoric Douglas County.\nNow, staff and volunteers at the ranch are inviting people to come out for petrified wood hikes where they can get a closer look at the rare prehistoric specimens.\n\"We actually take people out and let them handle the wood,\" volunteer Peter Brown said last week. \"You get a chance to come and touch and pick up and see how we do the science. I think it makes the tour very worthwhile.\"\nAdvertisement Brown has been volunteering with Cherokee Ranch & Castle for at least seven years. The Sedalia Elementary School teacher and his friend and fellow teacher John McKinney regularly lead student groups on science-focused hikes on the ranch.\nIn the 1860s, newspaper reporter Fitz Hugh Ludlow wrote about a petrified forest in the Daniels Park area, Brown said. The castle has more than 4,000 pieces of petrified wood built into it. It wasn't until six years ago though that McKinney uncovered the first of what is now more than 30 known petrified logs, some nearly 3-feet thick and more than 10 feet long. Now, he and Brown lead tour groups to them.\nBrown is fascinated by what the logs reveal about Douglas County just after the dinosaurs died out.\n\"What the cellular anatomy tells us is that these trees grew in a very low tropical or subtropical climate,\" Brown said last week as he stood near a log he calls King Stump. \"Most of the trees have no growth rings. They grew at a very constant rate. Rain would have been abundant. And steady rain. Not a wet and dry season.\"\nAl Koch, a geologist and director of the Cherokee Ranch Science Institute that operates on the property, theorized the logs were around 55 million years old after studying samples under a microscope in his rock lab. Koch said he is proud of the research Brown and others have done on the logs.\nThe work was aided by Elisabeth Wheeler , a professor emeritus in North Carolina State University's Department of Forest Biomaterials and wood anatomy expert. After connecting with Brown through a friend, Wheeler visited Cherokee Ranch in 2014. This summer, Brown visited her in North Carolina where they studied samples against her database. They identified cellular features similar to the modern Laurel tree family, which includes avocado and Bay Laurel trees.\n\"Finding good logs that are from flowering plants from that time period is really rare,\" Wheeler said, adding just 21 plant wood types have been found in North America from the Paleocene period. \"You really get a feel for the past out there.\"\nJames Holmes is the executive director of the Cherokee Ranch & Castle Foundation. The foundation is involved in many diverse ventures on the property, and Holmes said he wants to fix more of his focus on supporting and promoting the science institute and its impressive research and education work.\nHe said from what he has heard from people who have taken the petrified wood tour, many are blown away by what they see.\n\"You start thinking about the history of what things looked like back then,\" he said. \"We're in a pretty dense urban environment and you have this incredible opportunity to see something ancient.\"\nJoe Rubino: 303-954-2953 or jrubino@denverpost.com\nWant to take a petrified wood hike?\nCherokees Ranch & Castle, 6113 N.
