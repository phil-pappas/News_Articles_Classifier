He was also helping his friend refurbish a caf√© downtown, which just happened to be the venue for his first encounter with Tomoko.\n\"Just before the grand opening, he invited a bunch of his closer friends, and in walked Tomoko. There was something about her, just her smile... and her face lit up when she walked through the door. I was smitten,\" a beaming Michel says. \"For me, that was the moment, and I just kept trying from then on.\"\nBefore long, they became a couple, but Tomoko -- who grew up in Wakayama, Japan, a city about 80 kilometres southwest of Osaka -- decided the best move for her performing career would be to go to England to attend a circus school, since big-top options in Japan were limited.\n\"When I was a high school student, I started juggling,\" Tomoko says. \"And as I practised juggling I saw there's a modern circus; I saw Cirque du Soleil on TV, I saw a lot of acrobats and I just wanted to do it.\"\nWhile she was there, she \"fell in love with the aerial,\" and when Michel visited, he too found his calling in the aerial world, despite having no prior circus training.\n\"That's kind of how it began for me... It's all because of Tomoko,\" he says.\nThey began training as aerialists while in their 20s, a relatively late start, considering many aerial performers begin when they are children. They had to push themselves hard and learn fast in order to catch up. Michel, 39, and Tomoko, 35, still work ceaselessly to maintain their skills, but it's not as easy as it used to be for them to bounce back from injuries.\nThere's a huge benefit to having a spouse who lives and breathes the same working life. Michel says they share a support system -- both are intimately acquainted with the pain, stress and the highs and lows working under the white big top brings.\nThere are obvious challenges that result from being together as much as they are, but Michel and Tomoko say their passion for each other is matched by their passion for their art, so they make it a priority to prevent personal problems from spilling onto the stage.\n\"The times like that, we try to have our own time; I do my stuff, he does his thing,\" says Tomoko. \"Even if we fight, every day we have to go onstage together and we can't keep that emotion onstage, so we always try to solve the problem before going onstage and that helps us a lot.\"\n\"I think you have to be emotionally pretty mature; you have to have a good handle on your emotions,\" adds Michel. \"You're going to have disagreements... your partner is there for all -- the good, the not-so-good -- and we've learned pretty early on to deal with that in a positive way, use that as a strength. It just makes us better communicators.\"\nDespite the unavoidable rough patches, it would appear the couple is locked in a perpetual honeymoon phase -- the way they look at and speak to each other is filled with respect and admiration. They seem genuinely grateful they can experience this life together.\n\"You're all-in as a couple,\" says Michel. \"For us, it's just great, because I get to perform every night onstage with my wife.\"\nErin.lebar@freepress.mb.ca Twitter: @NireRabel", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:57:30.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
