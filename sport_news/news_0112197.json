Six out of 10 of us haven't even received our chip-enabled cards yet. \nThursday is the deadline for stores to have new equipment in place to take the more-secure chip cards. If they don't, it's the retailer, and not the credit card issuer, who is on the hook for any fraudulent charges. \nBut Visa says only 5 percent of 6 million merchants are ready. \nIf you've been issued a new credit card in recent months, it probably has a chip in it. \n\"I didn't realize I even had a chip in my card. I never looked at it that much,\" Shopper Jessie Oakley said. \nWhile consumers may not be aware of the big switch--from swiping a credit card with a magnetic strip to dipping a card with a chip into the machine--retailers had better be. \n\"The credit card processors want the retailers to have some skin in the game and that's not all bad either,\" Jessie Schmidt with the Better Business Bureau said. \nMeaning that without the new equipment for taking the chip cards, shop owners like Caroline Peterson will now be responsible for fraudulent charges on a credit card at her store. \n\"My initial reaction was, ‘that’s not fair.' The second reaction was, it is making it much more safe for our customers and eventually for us too, because we now have the processors,\" Peterson said. \nBut Peterson says in 28 years of owning the shop, she only knows of one bad credit card coming through. \n\"And it was something we should have noticed. It said Richard Nixon on the card. So we should have noticed that and that's been 20 years ago,\" Peterson said. \nWhile shelling out several hundred dollars for new card processors may not sound like a lot, it can make a difference for a small business. \n\"Money that comes right off the bottom line; so $500 to us--it's not chicken feed,\" Peterson said. \nNext week Plums Cooking is launching its new online retail site. But the new rules won't really affect online retailers at all--because you'll still put in your card number as you've always done when you shop online. \nPeterson says while she's ready to accept the new chip cards, it's not only some retailers lagging behind. \n\"We have some cards that don't process through this, that even have the chips. And that's because the banks are not ready yet either,\" Peterson said. \nThat's why your older cards with magnetic strips will continue to work on the machines too. \nTo use the new chip card, you insert your card into the terminal and then leave it there. Then you'll be asked to either put in a PIN in the case of a debit card, or sign it. \nThe transaction shouldn't be complete until you remove the card. \nIt could take up to five years for the new chip and dip system to be fully in effect. © 2015 KELOLAND TV.
