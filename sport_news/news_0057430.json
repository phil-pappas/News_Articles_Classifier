Takter and Bob McIntosh of Windsor, Ont., had shared the mark of three victories by a trainer.\nTakter came into harness racing's richest event leading all trainers in wins (21) and purses (US$9.4 million) but the Swedish conditioner said the six Crown wins rank as a career highlight.\n\"I would say so,\" he said. \"It was almost 100 per cent work out there.\n\"I have to thank all my crew and my owners. Without them we couldn't stand here. These horses are fantastic.”\nTakter won with The Bank in the three-year-old colt trot, Wild Honey in the three-year-old filly trot, All The Time in the two-year-old filly trot, Pure Country in the two-year-old filly pace, Creatine in the open trot and Always B Miki in the open pace.\nMiller, an American, had a record five driving wins, breaking the mark of four set by compatriot Tim Tetrick in 2012 at Woodbine. Canadian Yannick Gingras was also a multiple winner with two driving victories on a track that went from good to sloppy over the course of the night.\nMiller was victorious in the three-year-old filly pace with Divine Caroline, the mare trot with 2/5 favourite D One, Colors A Virgin in the open mare pace as well as The Bank and Always B Miki.\nMiller said Saturday night's achievement is on par with the 10-win day he had Sept. 18, 2003 at the Little Brown Jug.\n\"That's a really, really close comparison,\" he said. \"It's a night I'll never forget.\n\"It's night you dream about.\"\nSeven of the 12 favourites won races on the night.\nGingras, of Sorel, Que., captured the two-year-old colt trot with 1/9 favourite Southwind Frank and two-year-old filly trot with All The time.\nGingras had Mission Brief comfortably leading the three-year-old filly trot before the 1/5 favourite broke stride down the stretch, giving Wild Honey, driven by John Campbell of Ailsa Craig, Ont., the stunning win in 1:54.3. Im So Fancy was second ahead of Speak To Me.\nCampbell earned his 47th career Breeders Crown win but admitted he was fortunate Mission Brief broke stride.\n\"My filly struggled a little bit in the last turn, I really had to be careful with her there and at that point I was thinking I'm just not going to get (Mission Brief),\" he said. \"If you're going to beat her you have to be right up on her back well into the stretch.\n\"When I came out of the turn and she squared up I looked and Yannick was out in the middle of the racetrack off stride. At that point I was just wondering about what was coming from behind.\"\nGingras drove Southwind Frank to an 11th win in 12 outings. Gingras said the most difficulty he had with his horse came prior to the start of the race.\n\"Behind the gate he was maybe a bit more aggressive,\" Gingras said. \"He had been like that earlier in the year so I just wanted to get him off on the right foot.\n\"The rest of the way I was pretty confident.\"\nGingras, who drove in nine finals, knew early Southwind Frank was special.\n\"From the first time I sat behind him he was all business,\" Gingras said. \"Every time I've raced him he's (been) a true professional.\nGingras drove All The Time to an eighth win in 10 races. Haughty came into the race having won seven straight but settled for second, finishing ahead of Caprice Hill.\nElsewhere, in other races:\n— Tim Tetrick drove 18/1 longshot Boston Red Rocks to the upset win in the two-year-old colt pace in 1:51.3 ahead of Big Top Hanover and Investment Blue Chip. Metro winner Control The Moment, the 3/5 favourite, was looking to improve to 9-0.\n— Freeky Feet Pete, the 6/5 favourite driven by Trace Tetrick of the U.S., came on late to win the three-year-old colt pace in 1:50.0. Artspeak was second ahead of Lost For Words.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T11:11:37.637+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
