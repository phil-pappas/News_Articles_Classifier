The 2.4-mile concrete multi-purpose path includes a 120-foot pedestrian bridge along the north side of the interstate, according to a release from Colorado Department of Transportation. It cuts through Denver-owned Genesee Park, a portion of which is the Buffalo Overlook, home to the city's buffalo herd .\nThe path will eliminate the need for cyclists traveling on U.S. 40 to ride on the shoulder of the interstate through the portion where the two routes merge before U.S. 40 verges off the highway at Evergreen Parkway.\nConstruction for the project is not expected to impact traffic on I-70, outside of lane closures at the Genesee on-ramp and Evergreen Parkway exit. Construction is expected to last through February 2016. The final step will be installation of the bridge, which will be built off-site.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:07:24.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
