I guess I moved too fast when I changed direction,\" Mendoza said. \"At first the pain was really bad. I couldn't walk on it. But coach (Mark) Haynes came out and helped me up and I was able to walk off, hobble off.\" \nThe diagnosis was a torn anterior cruciate ligament and meniscus in his knee, which meant his junior season was over in week four. Being relegated to watching from the sideline was tough for Mendoza. \nHe started playing football in eighth grade and hadn't suffered an injury more severe than an ankle sprain before last year. \n\"Oh, it was hard,\" Mendoza said. \"I spent eight or nine months out and I had to watch eight games last year. I had to be on the sideline for my team.\" \nHeritage football coach Perry Escalante said the 18-year-old has not missed a beat returning from the injury. \n\"Oh he's not missing a lick as far as mental preparation,\" Escalante said. \"He's very physical, quick, good with his hands. He has a real nose for the ball. He was really good for us last year and I really think he's picked right back up where he was.\" \nEscalante praised Mendoza's work ethic and maturity as the senior didn't fall into the trap of putting on bad weight after suffering a leg injury, which limits a person's ability to exercise. \n\"Oh he did his upper body weight work and stayed in pretty good shape,\" Escalante said. \"Yeah, sometimes you see guys put on 20 pounds, but that wasn't Andy.\" \nWar Eagles defensive coordinator Paul Wilson agreed with Escalante that Mendoza has shown no ill effects at all. \n\"It was interesting that he wasn't tentative with it,\" Wilson said. \"I think we were more concerned with it than he was.\" \nBut Mendoza admitted there were a few doubts in his mind immediately after the doctor released him to contact. But they went away quickly. \n\"When the season started I felt good about it,\" Mendoza said. \"My knee was good.\" \nBecause of injuries to a couple other players this season, Mendoza has been asked to play some defensive end, a position he's played some but it's not his best spot according to coaches. \n\"He's done a good job,\" Escalante said. \"He gets off blocks and uses his hands really well. When Andy's down inside it's a different deal.\" \nHe showed that with a big performance last week against Springdale as teammate Jed Wilson returned to his normal defense end spot, which allowed Mendoza to go back to tackle. \nThe senior wreaked havoc, finishing with 11 tackles (10 solos), a sack, two quarterback hurries, a forced fumble, a fumble recovery and two tackles for loss. \nMendoza is hopeful of continuing his football career at the college level and coaches believe he could make that dream a reality. That's big since a year ago he was forced to just watch the game he enjoys to play. \n\"Now that I'm a senior I've started to explore playing in college,\" Mendoza said. \"I'm hope I can. I love the sport and want to continue playing.\" \nSports on 10/02/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:38:02.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
