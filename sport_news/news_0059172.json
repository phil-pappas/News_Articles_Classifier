In just her second season on the courts for the Kirksville tennis team, Partenheimer delivered everything that a No. 1 tennis player is expected to do and for that reason and others, Partenheimer is the 2015 Kirksville Daily Express Girls Tennis Player of the Year. “I’m really happy about that. It definitely was a season that stood out in my mind a lot because so many things happened,” Partenheimer said. “I went to state for doubles, I was No. 1, and not only that, but the team this year. The top six, we got so tight and had lots of bonding nights. This is a season that I’m going to remember for a long time and I feel like being picked Player of the Year tops that off, the cherry on top.” Smith saw her as a sophomore last season have the athletic gifts that could have pushed her all the way to No. 4, but she just ran into walls during the ladder matches. This year, with the top three players from last year graduating, Partenheimer battled Emily Weichelt for the No. 1 spot and those matches showed how similar the two were. “What they have in common is that they both have quick feet, probably the quickest on the team,” Smith said. “Most kids have that little calculation in their head, wondering if they can get to that ball, so they’ll spend a little time deciding if they can get to the ball. Probably five or six points in each match, the time you make that decision, well, you didn’t have that time to make that decision and you end up losing that point. Emily and Angelina, they don’t stop to make that calculation.” As the season progressed, Smith saw Partenheimer continue to improve and develop. Outside of quick feet, Partenheimer said her size and being a dancer helped this season. “I know I’m athletic. I’m a good runner and I’m also a dancer and because of that I can move around a lot. I’m fast, flexible, can jump and I’m tall, and that plays into it a lot,” Partenheimer said. Another thing that really stood out to Smith was her competitive fire and that really came into play during the state doubles tournament. “Usually, I wouldn’t consider myself an extremely competitive person. I focus more on my game at the moment and how well I’m going to play. I play very hard and I play to win,” Partenheimer said. “At state, it was a different scenario. I had heard all the way down how great John Burroughs is and how great their players are. I starting thinking, ‘I really want to win this first match, so I can play them,’ and I wanted to win one game at state.” Page 2 of 2 - Partenheimer and Hayley Smith would win their first round match against Erica Reynolds and Macy Hall of Bolivar before falling to the higher-seeded Kikki Peters and Maddy Duncan from John Burroughs, 6-2, 6-0, in the quarterfinals Smith really enjoyed his time with such an enthusiastic player on the courts this year and is looking forward for another year with her next year, if she is able to come out and compete. Partenheimer may be academically ineligible to participate next year due to the amount of classes she will be taking at the high school next year but she is hoping to be able to play again. If this was her last season with the tennis team, it won’t be one she’ll soon forget. “If this was the end of my experience with the tennis team, I’m very happy with the experience. Not only with playing tennis but with the whole thing. The late bus rides and being with my friends, the practices and dealing with other teams. The whole thing will be something I want to remember for a long time,” Partenheimer said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:38:46.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
