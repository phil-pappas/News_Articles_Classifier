They have only allowed seven goals over the first five games of the year. \nGoaltender Corbin Kaczperski leads the way for Lone Star, only allowing two goals in two games. \nThe Brahmas are also the NAHL South Division Regular Season and Playoff Champions from a year ago. \n“They’re a pretty talented group,” RoadRunners coach Scott Langer said. “Their system and structure are both in place. They almost look like a team in mid-year form.” \nDespite two losses, Topeka also had major successes in the showcase. Forward Cam Strong notched a hat trick in the team’s 5-0 win against Wilkes-Barre Scranton. Langer said Strong’s method of getting to the gritty areas of the ice in front of the net will be crucial against the tough goaltending duo for Lone Star. \n“Lone Star is a big team, so they’re not going to easily let you to that area of the ice you want to be in,” Langer said. “It’s going to take effort and strong will to get to the results we want. If we want to win against a team like that, it’s going to take an all-out effort from all four lines.” \nLanger said he also doesn’t necessarily think his team should be concerned about its lack of offensive output in a couple of the games it played in the showcase. \n“I thought the way we played overall in the showcase was actually very good,” Langer said. “We had trouble scoring at times, especially against New Jersey, and they were a little more opportunistic than us. Each game we couldn’t win, we just couldn’t score. That was the bottom line.” \nFor Langer, this past week’s showcase was his first game back as the head coach since last season, after battling with some health issues in the offseason. Assistant coach Josh Kamrass covered for him in his absence. \n“Being back there behind the bench coaching those young men is certainly where I want to be,” Langer said. “It felt good to finally get back there, especially after such a long summer.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:43:05.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
