Good thing too, because the former LSU two-sport athlete has had plenty of waiting on his hands since an arduous journey to pro sports began after the 2009 football season.\nSo many detours have popped up that you might guess that the New Orleans native has reached for the white flag. Life goes on, after all, when all the cheering stops.\nJones isn't at that point, though. Not yet. Not when he has come so close.\nThe most recent comeback began last week when Jones, who turned 27 on Oct. 5, got back on the mound in the Arizona Fall League for a short stint.\nHis goal was to test a surgically repaired left elbow and shoulder from reconstruction and maintenance surgeries over the last 16 months. It was Jones' first live action since the end of winter ball in 2013.\nIn one inning of work, Jones' velocity was in the high 80s, he struck out the first batter he faced and got the next two on routine popups.\n\"These last surgeries were a setback, and some of it was from old football injuries,\" Jones said recently from Arizona. \"The elbow was the more serious one, but I needed the shoulder done because the joint between my collar bone and shoulder bone was smashed. It was bone on bone when I threw.\"\nCincinnati pitcher Chad Jones: ''This is my second chance, and lot of people don'ÂÂt even get a first chance like the one I had. This is a blessing, and I'm not going to mess it up.' Courtesy of Cincinnati Enquirer So Jones went back under the knife instead of back to the mound after his second pro career had just started showing some promise in 2013 with time in Arizona and then a promotion to low Single-A ball.\nThat part of the story takes some setting up, though.\nTurn back the clock to the spring of 2010 when Jones entered the NFL Draft after three seasons at LSU and national championships in both football (2007) and baseball (2009). The New York Giants picked him in the third round and gave him a four-year contract worth over $2 million.\nAfter some offseason OTA work when Jones impressed enough to generate the promise that he could be an immediate impact player, fate stepped in and not gently.\nJune 10, 2010 happened.\nEarly that morning, Jones was headed home to his new house in New Orleans following a night out with friends when the tires of his new Ranger Rover apparently got caught in the groove of a streetcar track on Carrollton Avenue.\nAn extensive investigation showed no indication of alcohol in Jones' system. It's possible he dozed off right before the accident, but he can't recall clearly exactly how the accident unfolded. That means he doesn't know precisely what happened during a one-car wreck when Jones' car was split in two and the front wheel axle jabbed into Jones' leg through his left heel and pierced his calf and thigh.\nA delicate and life-saving 11-hour surgery followed after Jones -- in excruciating pain -- was extracted from the vehicle. That was the first of 19 surgeries over the next three years that left his leg mangled and scarred but amazingly functional.\nFootball got one more try and when that didn't get off the launching pad, Jones returned to the diamond. He held a handful of free-agent tryouts for pro scouts and attracted the attention of several, including Cincinnati.\nWhen Jones entered the draft instead of signing as a free agent, the Reds grabbed him in the 9 th round of the 2013 draft with the 285 th overall pick. Higher than he was selected in 2007 after his senior year at Southern Lab (13 th round) or 2010 (50 th round) once he declared for the NFL Draft.\nChad Jones takes a new path: Video The former LSU star has moved onto baseball after a nasty car accident derailed his NFL career.\nBy mid-summer 2013, Jones was making progress in the Arizona Instructional League, despite being much older than most of his teammates.\n\"He's so big and strong and such a good athlete, so the physical part of it was never a problem,\" said Reds pitching instructor Tom Brown , a Louisiana native and Skip Bertman's first pitching coach at LSU from 1984-88.\n\"There was never a doubt he had the physical tools he needed. It was the mental side of it that beat him him up at times. He was coming to the ballpark every day with no real chance to get in a ballgame, and then as soon as he was just about to that point, something else would happen.\"\nIndeed, right as Jones was starting to round into shape early in 2014, his body abruptly put things on hold again when tendons in his left elbow tore and brought comeback No. 2 to a halt.\nBrown said Jones was throwing as good as he had seen him since he joined the franchise before \"life jumped up and slapped him in the face again.\"\nUndeterred, Jones underwent elbow reconstruction (Tommy John) surgery with LSU graduate and world-renowned surgeon Dr. James Andrews on May 20, 2014, and the recovery clock of a full year began.\n\"Hearing that news, that I needed more surgery, was terrible for me,\" Jones said. \"Mentally, I was ready to go, but my arm was holding back. Last year was supposed to be a big year for me. A lot of those (Cincinnati front-office) guys were looking forward to seeing me take the next step.\"\nThat was the physical part of the equation. The thing with pitchers working their way back from the Tommy John procedure is that it takes incremental progress and that creates mental hurdles as treacherous as the physical ones.\nAnd patience.\nSpring arrived and Jones tested the elbow, but persistent soreness forced him to shut down again.\nChad Jones show the scars and damage left from a grisly injury suffered in a car wreck in 2010. Randy Rosetta, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune \"Chad has what I call thoroughbred syndrome,\" said Brown, whose father Charlie Brown was the legendary high school football coach at Neville High in Monroe.\n\"He's one of those guys that has so much athletic ability and his expectations are really high, so it bothered him to come back throwing 85 mph. It takes a long time to get past there and he's starting to get to that point.\"\nFinally feeling ready to throw, Jones went to the mound last week and tested his again reconfigured body.\nNot long stints, as he will be limited to 20-25 pitches per outing. But it was exactly the step Jones has been waiting for.\nAnd waiting is something that, for better or worse, Jones has mastered.\n\"What I've been through, it's definitely given me some patience,\" Jones said. \"I understood the rehab process about as well as anybody. When your body tells you to back off, you back off. It's definitely hard for me to have to go through that again, but I still had the mental toughness I needed to keep pushing.\"\nWhich brought Jones to where he is now.\nFormer LSU standout Chad Jones won a national championship with the baseball and football teams in his short college career. NOLA.com | Times-Picayune achives The low pitch limit is a fit because Jones projects as a left-handed specialist on the mound, and he has the velocity and kind of movement that could be an avenue to a big-league bullpen.\nThree scouts asked about Jones' potential said he absolutely could make his way to MLB if his health issues are finally behind him.\n\"I know I can perform when I get on field now,\" Jones said. \"I'm feeling ready physically and it's time to show what I can do. Things are looking very promising now that I know I'm healthy.\n\"I'm all put back together and brand new. I'm looking forward to next season and maybe getting a chance to knock on that door finally.\"\nChad Jones takes a different approach on a new playing field\nMainieri has no doubt Chad Jones could pitch in the big leagues\nNOLA native, ex-LSU Chad Jones standout still chasing a dream", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:27:25.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
