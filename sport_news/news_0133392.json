TORONTO — Fed up with his own bat, Hanser Alberto grabbed one belonging to teammate Delino DeShields.\nGood choice, rookie.\nAlberto, the seldom-used backup infielder, lined a tiebreaking single to center in the 14th inning, helping the Texas Rangers beat the Toronto Blue Jays, 6-4, for a 2-0 lead in the best-of-five AL Division Series.\n\"I didn’t even ask him for it,\" Alberto said, smiling at DeShields sitting beside him at the postgame interview. \"Good wood, too, you know?\"\nIt sure was. DeShields then picked the bat up and put it to good use, driving in another run with an infield hit after Liam Hendriks replaced La Troy Hawkins (0-1),\nThe underdog Rangers will try to sweep the Blue Jays at home in Game 3 on Sunday. Martin Perez will start for Texas against Marco Estrada.\n\"This is an uphill battle but it’s been done before,\" Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin said.\nSan Francisco was the last team to do it, coming back to beat Cincinnati three straight times after losing at home in the first two games of their 2012 NL Division Series.\nAlberto, batting last and only in the lineup because star third baseman Adrian Beltre was out with a strained back, made an error that led to Toronto’s first two runs but redeemed himself with his big hit in extra innings.\n\"We were pretty confident going into the second game regardless of Adrian getting hurt,\" DeShields said. \"We were kind of bummed out about that, but we kept our heads up.\"\nAlberto, 22, who made his big league debut this season, also had a sacrifice fly.\n\"It’s extremely special for him,\" Rangers first-year manager Jeff Banister said. \"Really, a guy that has sat at the end of the bench for us, an extra player.\"\nTexas shut out the highest-scoring team in the majors after the fifth inning. The victory for Banister’s team made road clubs 5-0 in the playoffs to that point — the only previous time that happened in the postseason was the 1906 all-Chicago World Series, STATS said.\nKansas City snapped that skid a little later Friday with a 5-4 victory over Houston in Game 2 of their Division Series. Rangers relief pitcher Keone Kela (1-0) worked one inning for the win.\nCecil done for series? \nBlue Jays reliever Brett Cecil tore his left calf muscle during Friday’s AL Division Series game and might be done for the postseason.\nCecil, Toronto’s top left-hander in the bullpen, was injured while tagging Mike Napoli in a rundown that ended the eighth inning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:20:45.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
