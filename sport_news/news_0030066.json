It reminds me of that. It’s all starting to come together. It’s not only the pitching, but people who can produce runs, catch the ball. When you start to put that all together, that’s when you have a team over 162 games that is primed and ready to go. The playoffs, you just don’t know, because it’s all the best teams at their best. So, they are going to have to turn it up a notch.”\nThe addition of Gary Carter helped the Mets get over the hump.

It’s so tough to get through the playoffs now.”\nFellow TBS analyst and World Series champion Pedro Martinez agrees that the Mets are a “dangerous team.” Martinez pointed to the importance of Steven Matz pitching in the series to get out the\nDodgers big lefty bats and a curiosity to seeing the 22-year-old Syndergaard on the playoff stage.\nNoah Syndergaard Photo: Ray Stubblebine “Syndergaard is a kid that is going to be a bulldog, a big horse in the future. He’s the youngest one, but his demeanor on the mound is impressive,” Martinez said. “I can’t wait to see him in the future. He has the mental toughness and approach of a big-time pitcher. If he does it now it would be surprising, but I expect him to be better in a few years. Anything he accomplishes here would be over-achieving.”\nThe decision to pitch Syndergaard in Game 2 on the road — where he has been significantly less effective than he’s been at Citi Field — pushed Matt Harvey to Game 3. The controversial righty angered captain David Wright when he missed Tuesday’s workout.\n“The issue for [Harvey] is this is a really hard game to pitch without a target on your back,” Darling said. “And Game 3 is always the most important, you’re down by two you’re saving the season, you’re up two you can take your team to NLCS, if you’re 1-1 it becomes the pivotal game of the series. If Matt throws nine shutout innings, do you think anyone is going to care?”\n  los angeles dodgers ,  matt harvey ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  noah syndergaard ,  ron darling", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:04:56.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
