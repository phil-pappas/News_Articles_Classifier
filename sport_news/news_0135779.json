Donald Trump’s biggest fan may be a Columbian immigrant — but a day after she enthusiastically gushed about the GOP hopeful on stage at a rally, some skeptics wondered if the billionaire paid for her support.\n“I'm Hispanic, and I vote for Mr. Trump! We vote for Mr. Trump!” a woman shouted at a Las Vegas rally Thursday. “Yes! Mr. Trump! We love you! We love you all the way to the White House!”\nThe Republican frontrunner pulled the overly enthusiastic woman — later identified as Las Vegas resident Myriam Witcher — on stage after he spotted her proudly holding a copy of “People” with the Trump family on the cover.\nWitcher could not contain her excitement. She shrieked as she ran to the lectern and emotionally sang her support for Trump into the microphone.\nWhen the seemingly random audience memebr mentioned she was originally from Colombia, Trump — who has been sharply criticized for his anti-immigration rhetoric — quickly realized the supporter was almost too-good-to-be-true.\n“Is this a set up? Did I ever meet you before?” he asked her.\nWitcher refused to answer the question. Instead, she shrieked into the microphone.\n\"I swear to you, I think she's totally beautiful and great,” he said hugging her. “I never met her before, I swear.”\nThe frontrunner then signer her magazine and kissed her on the head.\n“That’s my relationship with Hispanics,” Trump declares.\nBut despite Trump’s insistence that Witcher was a total stranger, skeptics doubted her status as the billionaire’s No. 1 fan.\nTrump’s campaign reportedly paid scores of actors to cheer him on during his presidential campaign announcement. Witcher could be his latest hire, critics said.\n“I wonder how much Trump actually paid her for her to be a \"spontaneous hispanic supporter\" in the crowd,” one Twitter user wrote.\n“Apparently Trump paid a Hispanic woman to go on stage and proclaim she loves Trump. It is the most obv actor he's gotten yet,” another wrote.\nThe Daily News could not immediately reach Witcher for comment.\nThe Las Vegas Sun talked to Witcher before she was pulled up on stage. In the pre-rally interview she said she supported Trump’s promise to boot illegal immigrants from the country. The Colombia native said she waited years to move to the U.S. legally.\n“I’m Hispanic, Latina, and I love me some Trump,” she told the newspaper. “He’s the perfect man, a businessman.”\nmwagner@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Donald Trump readies down-the-stretch 2016 primary strategy Donald Trump sends ‘sweating’ Marco Rubio water, towels 5 products available in the Trump Campaign Store", "external_links": ["http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:38:33.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
