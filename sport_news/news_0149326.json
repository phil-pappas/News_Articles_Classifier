Then in last Tuesday’s game, Lee had five goals — four in the first half — as Lourdes cruised to an 8-2 win over Central Wisconsin Christian. \nAll-time team achievement \n“When I played basketball when we were conference champs.” \nGoals for this season \n“I just hope that I can help out the team by doing what forwards are supposed to do. Not to be selfish but to play as a teammate rather than individually.” \nPaul’s thoughts \n“Last week everything started from the tournament we had (last) Saturday and from there we played well as a team and everyone stepped up. They were ready to go and so we played well as a team and won both games. That got us the confidence for the game on Tuesday against CWC. Our team played well and I got lucky, I had good chances.” \nPaul’s favorites \n• Pro/college athlete: Stephen Curry, Golden State Warriors \n• Pro/college team: Golden State Warriors \n• TV show: Shark Tank \n• Favorite quote or piece of advice: Prove them wrong \nWhat if ... \n• You could be any celebrity on Earth for a week. Who would it be? Cristiano Ronaldo \n• If you could listen to a song to get you hyped up for the biggest athletic event of your life, what would it be? Jump Around \n• You could meet one famous person, who would it be? Taylor Swift \nQuick Q&A \n• Who inspires you the most? My dad \n• Who’s the toughest opponent you have ever faced? For soccer, St. Lawrence Seminary \n• Why are sports important to you? It keeps me motivated and sports really builds up team work and I value the leadership that it requires \n• What’s your strength as a person? I like to stay positive and push myself to the best \n• What do you still need to work on? Shooting \n• Do you have any pre-game rituals? I say a little prayer before every game \nCoach Peter LaCourse’s thoughts \n“I think when he came to us last year there was lots of opportunity for growth and he’s really taken advantage of those opportunities. The best thing about him that I’ve learned is that he’s a learner, he’s really literate. He goes out of his way to expand his knowledge, which helps him as a learner. As a player, he’s very competitive and very surreal. He’s also well-rounded, he’s top of his class so I’m glad to see the success he’s having on the field, I know he enjoys playing the game a lot and he’s a fan of it.” \nAlex Wolf: (920) 426-6661; awolf@gannett.com; on Twitter @Wolfa07 11 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://oshko.sh/1LeFIvc TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:12:21.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
