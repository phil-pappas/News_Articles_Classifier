Golden Tate returns Tate was a key contributor as a receiver and punt returner from 2010 to Seattle’s Super Bowl season in 2013 but ended up departing for Detroit after the season when the Lions handed him a 5-year, $31 million contract. He responded with a career year, nabbing 99 receptions for 1,331 yards and four touchdowns in 2014, establishing himself as a viable safety net for quarterback Matthew Stafford opposite Calvin Johnson.
