Photo: AP\nAfter landing at Heathrow Airport in London early Friday, the New York Jets will disembark and make a left toward customs, where six lines will be devoted to their delegation of 220 people. To safeguard against any mishaps later, passports will be collected after everyone clears, and then a brigade of Virgin Atlantic representatives will escort the Jets to seven buses waiting outside.\nThis will be the procedure because Aaron Degerness, the Jets' senior manager of team operations, walked this route in June, when he made his second scouting trip to London in advance of their game Sunday against the Miami Dolphins at Wembley Stadium.\nDegerness learned which gate the plane would pull into, which door the team would exit and where the jet bridge would deposit the group. He also learned that when the Jets flew home, their walkway would meander past duty-free shops, and that worries him, if only a little.\nNew York Jets head coach Todd Bowles.

Just keep walking,'\" Degerness said. \"Those are the things that keep us up at night - that we get through security, someone stops at duty free, and we leave Ryan Fitzpatrick because we didn't know he wasn't there.\"\nAdvertisement In that unlikely event, the Jets have a solution: As each player boards the plane, a team official will cross off the player's name with a highlighter.\nThe Jets learned in November that they would be playing in London, and they have spent the past 11 months planning for about 65 hours overseas, an undertaking that Degerness said involved about 10 times the work that preparing to play at Miami would have required.\nJeremy Kerleyof the New York Jets scores a touchdown against the Philadelphia Eagles. Photo: Getty-Images\nIf the Jets were playing in South Florida, for instance, they would not have needed to pack more than 5000 items - ranging from cereal and extension cords to gauze pads and wrist bands - onto a ship containing supplies for all six NFL teams playing in London this season.\nThey would not have needed to list the value and country of origin for the contents in every trunk or bag. Or find an industrial launderer to pick up soiled practice clothing at one location and deliver it clean to another. Or fly in the chef at their London hotel to observe how food is cooked and served at team headquarters.\nOr order 350 rolls of toilet paper to replace the thinner version used in England.\n\"Some may say that's a little over the top or whatnot, but it didn't really cost that much, so why not?\" Degerness said. \"We're basically trying to replicate everything that we're doing here over there.\"\nThat planning began soon after the game was announced. The process included photographing Wembley Stadium and calling on a sleep specialist who advised players how to minimise jet lag.\nFrom the outset, Clay Hampton, senior director of team operations, started soliciting advice from counterparts with teams that had played in London. A valuable resource was Hamzah Ahmad of the Jacksonville Jaguars, who on October 25 will play at Wembley for a third consecutive season.\nIn a telephone interview, Ahmad, the Jaguars' director of football logistics and facilities, said that in their initial conversations, Hampton had asked him to consider: \"What are the basic things that we don't think about on a day-to-day basis? That's what you plan for.\"\nThat meant reminding players to call their cellphone providers and credit card companies before taking off and to plug in electrical adapters, lest the higher voltage fry their Xboxes or favourite hair clippers. It meant shipping over condiment staples that could be difficult to procure, like hot sauce and barbecue sauce. It also meant considering whether to distribute the per diem in pounds or dollars (the Jets stuck with dollars).\n\"It's one of those things you have to go through,\" Hampton said. \"Until you go through it yourself, you're never going to know.\"\nJets officials made two reconnaissance trips to London. On the first visit, at the end of February, Degerness and Hampton scouted potential practice sites and about six hotels recommended by the league. At the time, they did not know whether coach Todd Bowles would prefer a long trip or a short one, so they evaluated each option.\nBowles ultimately favoured a brief stay so he could hold the week's most critical workouts, Wednesday and Thursday, at the Jets' practice centre here.\nDegerness analysed how teams that had travelled to England had fared based on the length of their trip and which lodging they chose and reported his findings to Bowles, who opted to set precedents. The Jets will be the first NFL team to stay at their hotel and are the first NFL team to practice at the London Irish rugby club.\nFor those practices, the NFL helps provide field equipment, like game clocks, pop-up dummies and lifts that elevate video cameras, and it also supplies projectors and copy machines for meeting rooms. But teams develop packing lists on their own.\nHampton and Degerness collaborated with equipment manager Gus Granneman, who met with his staff before training camp to determine how much apparel - and what kind - to take. Extra T-shirts and shorts, sizes large through XXXXL, were necessities, they concluded, as was assembling a third full set of gear for a walk-through Saturday at Wembley.\nAny supplies that contain alcohol or are considered combustible (like batteries) are not permitted to be stowed as plane cargo. They were sent on the ocean freighter, which left the New York area in August.\nAccounting for cooler weather, Granneman packed sideline coats and hand warmers - things he said he had never considered, and never would again, for a road game against Miami.\n\"It's almost like a winter game,\" Granneman said. \"It's like going to Buffalo this time of year. You probably take the same stuff.\"\nAll that stuff, though, cannot be cleaned the same way. At the equipment managers' meetings in March, Granneman spoke with colleagues from the Dolphins and the Atlanta Falcons, both of whom played in London last year, and asked for their advice. Laundry was, and remains, his primary concern.\nThe Jets are accustomed to their tailor in Rutherford, New Jersey, and Granneman, who worked in NFL Europe for three years as the equipment manager for the Barcelona Dragons, knows he must give detailed instructions.\n\"You're always scared about going to another country and your laundry comes back in a ball or something like that,\" he said.\nGranneman said something as simple as temperature instructions must be explained to the laundry operator in specific degrees.\nHe added: \"You don't even tell him low heat. You say, 'I want this at 100 degrees Fahrenheit, whatever it is Celsius,' because 'low heat' might be something entirely different to him.\"\nGranneman and his staff planned to stay late Wednesday arranging trunks that they would start loading onto a truck at 8am Thursday, and they expected to work at a frenetic pace all the way through Sunday night, when the Jets return to Heathrow for their flight home.\nThey know where their buses will drop them off, which escalators to ascend and where to pass through security - almost as if they have done it before.\nNew York Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:30:11.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
