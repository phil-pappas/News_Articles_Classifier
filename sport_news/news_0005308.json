Women’s Soccer League thriving in Frederick 0 Staff photo by Sam Yu \nTracy Hathaway, left, of the Blood Sweat and Beers team and Tricia Paredes of the Kickin’ Big team converge on the ball during a Women’s Soccer League game at Chuck Foreman Field at Ballenger Creek Park. Staff photo by Sam Yu \nGabby Alico of the Kickin’ Big team prepares to strike the ball as Jen Kitchen of the Blood Sweat and Beers team approaches. \nMaura King is a soccer mom, but in a different sort of way. \nThe 58-year-old Montgomery County resident watched her daughter grow up playing the sport, going with her when she played travel club soccer. When King turned 40, she thought she’d give it a try, playing in an adult league in Germantown. \n“I got hooked,” said King, who has four other children and one grandchild. \nTurns out, she’s not the only soccer mom who has decided to get into the game. \nKing is one of many women with children who are playing adult league soccer. While it was convenient for King to play in Germantown, there were women in Frederick County who had to travel as long as an hour one way to play. \n“The travel was hard, and the ladies wondered why there couldn’t be a local Frederick County league,” Keith Tapley, recreation specialist for Frederick County Division of Parks and Recreation, said in an email to the News-Post . \nThe county heard the pleas. \nFrederick County Division of Parks and Recreation started a four-team women’s adult soccer league this year, with all matches played at Chuck Foreman Field at Ballenger Creek Park. The response has been overwhelming. \n“Before this league started, we had to go to either Howard County or Montgomery County to play soccer,” said Kenda Sovero, a defender for Kick’n Big, one of the teams in the county league. “I didn’t have the opportunity to play outdoor, so I had to play indoor soccer.” \nTommi-Leigh Starick, of Frederick, agreed that an adult women’s soccer league could be started in the county, so she took her case to the county parks and recreation officials, Tapley said. \n“As the spring season progressed, Tommi-Leigh wanted information to be able to show there were enough women that wanted to play to warrant a league,” Tapley said. From there, Starick went about putting together a survey to see if a women’s league would be feasable. \nAvailable play dates and overall interest were a few of the questions asked in the survey, Tapley said. The response was good, with as many as 80 speaking in favor of starting such a league. \nThe next step was getting at least half of those interested to commit to the league, seeing how many teams could be formed, Tapley said. \nThe information was turned over to Eric Appel, county parks and recreation’s recreation supervisor. He got the league organized over the summer months. \nInitially, the league age was set as over-30, “but (the league) agreed that, especially for this inaugural season, we would be flexible on that age requirement.” \nEach team has a 22-player roster. The season has two weeks left. \nTeams play two 40-minute halves. There is no overtime, and no slide tackling is allowed. \nMary Booth, 51, of Frederick, also had children who played soccer in high school and college, but she never considered playing until a friend urged her to start about eight years ago. She plays just about every position. \n“Wherever I’m needed,” Booth said. “I really enjoy it.” \nThe ball doesn’t necessarily have the zip on it, as opposed to how the game is played on the high school and college level, but for the older players, it gives them a chance to continue to play the sport they love, sometimes in the presence of their family. \n“As long as my body lets me do it, I plan to keep on playing,” King said. \nTapley said the response was so great, some players went on a waiting list. \n“We still have people coming to us, interested in playing,” he said. \nWith the success of this inaugural season, expansion of the league is being considered. \n“We will look at the possibility of expansion in the future as we determine the level of interest from the different ages, skills,” Tapley said. “We could be looking at competitive divisions or age-based divisions.” Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:29:26.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
