Most notably, the 2006 Calciopoli scandal resulted in Juventus' relegation to Serie B and penalties for several other top clubs. \n\"Football keeps on reminding us that it's not just a rolling ball but also scandals, investigations and a series of trial cases,\" Italian Olympic Committee president Giovanni Malago said. \"This saddens us.\" \nAndrew Dampf can be followed at http://www.twitter.com/asdampf \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:05:32.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
