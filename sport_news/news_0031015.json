He'll still count $4.05 million against Philadelphia's cap even if he's sent to the American Hockey League. \n\"We're caught in a tough place here,\" Flyers general manager Ron Hextall said. \"We had to make a tough decision putting our best team on the ice, creating a roster spot and some cap space. It was a tough decision.\" \nHextall said there was a chance MacDonald could return to the Flyers. \nRaymond, caught in the Flames' logjam at forward, has two years left at a cap hit of $3.15 million. \nThe Boston Bruins waived forward Max Talbot, and the Winnipeg Jets waived defenseman Jay Harrison. Goaltender Dustin Tokarski was put on waivers by the Montreal Canadiens, with Mike Condon winning the backup job behind Carey Price. Former Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman Tim Erixon was waived by the Pittsburgh Penguins. The Edmonton Oilers already made their money-saving moves, sending defenseman Nikita Nikitin and goalie Ben Scrivens to the minor leagues after they cleared. Nikitin has one year left at a cap hit of $4.5 million; Scrivens has a year left at $2.3 million. Advertisement Canadiens: Forward Zack Kassian has entered a substance-abuse program after being involved in a motor vehicle accident. Kassian, 24, was placed in \"Stage Two of the Substance Abuse and Behavioral Health Program,\" according to a statement from the NHL and NHL Players Association. He is suspended without pay until he is cleared for on-ice competition by the program administrators. \nBlues: St. Louis signed forward Scottie Upshall, who had been in training camp as a tryout, to a one-year, two-way contract. Upshall, 31, is a 12-year veteran and had 15 points in 63 games with Florida last season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T06:55:25.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
