When you have finished many games, people remember more about the games you have not finished,\" said Dhoni after he failed to complete the job in the final over of the chase with India needing 11 runs. Disappointed at not getting the job done, Dhoni said, \"It is a gamble (playing the role of a finisher). Sometimes it pays off, sometimes it doesn't. But that is my role in the side. \"You have to play big shots. If the ball is coming on, you can use the pace of the bowlers and get away with it. But on wickets like these, where the average bounce is low, it becomes difficult to hit. Having said that, the shot selection wasn't great in the final over,\" the skipper conceded. He, however, sounded happy with the overall look of the batting line-up. \"I think our batting was really good. Rahane batting at 3, Virat at 4, followed by myself, Raina and Binny. It looks like a settled line-up with a lot of power and experience to chase big totals. That is why I have said that Rahane needs to bat higher up the order. That way our batting looks very strong on paper.\" The skipper was, however, disappointed with the team's bowling effort. Pacers Umesh Yadav, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Binny were hammered by AB de Villiers (104) as India conceded more than 100 runs in the last ten overs. \"As far as bowling is concerned, I really missed Ashwin's six overs in this game. Things were under control in the middle overs. But the death overs were simply not good. It is a bit disappointing as reverse swing was on offer. They should have executed their plans better, hitting-the-deck delivery or yorkers could have been used effectively,\" said Dhoni, adding that it was a 260-270 pitch. â€”PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:21:31.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
