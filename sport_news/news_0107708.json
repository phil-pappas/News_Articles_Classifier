La. – Do not go “Back to the Future” or “Back to the Past” because the LSU movie, “Back to the Present,” is being made now. \nNever in the history of LSU sports has it had perhaps the single best player in each of the big three sports at the same time – tailback Leonard Fournette in football, forward Ben Simmons in basketball and pitcher Alex Lange in baseball. \nFournette is running away with the early Heisman prognostication. Simmons has already won the Southeastern Conference Player of the Year before making a layup and may contend for national Player of the Year in the 2015-16 season. And Lange was the SEC Freshman of the Year last season and could be up next season for the Golden Spikes award that goes to the nation’s best college baseball player. \nIn 1988-89, LSU did have Tommy Hodson become an All-SEC first team quarterback and enter the ’89 season as a Heisman candidate while having Chris Jackson become just the second freshman ever to become a first team Associated Press All-American while also winning the SEC freshman of the year award. That was followed by pitcher Ben McDonald winning the Golden Spikes award and becoming the first player chosen in the 1989 MLB Draft. \nBen Simmons, considered the nation's top recruit, cast his lot with LSU some time back. (Photo: USA Today) \nBut the sports year LSU is reveling in at the moment could become the best ever. Fournette will win the Heisman with No. 5 LSU (6-0, 4-0 SEC) either winning the national championship or coming very close to it just as Simmons begins to show his swagger around the SEC. If he is as good as advertised, LSU could reach or come close to the Final Four. Lange helped take LSU to the College World Series last year at 12-0 with a 1.97 ERA and 131 strikeouts in 114 innings. If he improves and gets help, LSU could be back in Omaha to close out something they could be writing about in Grays Sports Almanac for decades to come. \nSo enjoy the moment and Saturday’s 6 p.m. game against Western Kentucky (6-1, 4-0 Conference USA) at Tiger Stadium on ESPNU. Here are five things to keep an eye on: \nJun 16, 2015; Omaha, NE, USA; LSU Tigers pitcher Alex Lange (35) celebrates the win after pitching a complete game against the Cal State Fullerton Titans in the 2015 College World Series at TD Ameritrade Park.

THE RECORD – This has been said before here, but really, this time, really, the Tigers’ tailback phenom could break LSU’s single game rushing record of 250 yards set by Lafayette’s Alley Broussard against Ole Miss in 2004. Western Kentucky has a great passing offense with quarterback Brandon Doughty and is capable of scoring a lot quickly against what has been a porous LSU secondary. So, LSU may want to keep the ball out of his hands by keeping it in Fournette’s hands, and Doughty may keep the Hilltoppers close as they are averaging 44 points a game for sixth in the nation. That means Fournette could play most or all of the game. Western Kentucky is 103rd in the nation in total defense with 438 yards allowed a game and is 77th against the run with 172 allowed a game. This might be it, Alley. \n2.BRANDON DOUGHTY VS. LSU SECONDARY – The senior quarterback for Western Kentucky is averaging 387 yards passing a game for third in the nation and is second in the nation in total passing yards with 2,709. He is also a starting quarterback. LSU’s defense has been struggling against backups all season as it is 10th in the SEC in passing efficiency. This game could be an extremely valuable teaching point for the Tigers’ secondary, which must play better to beat Alabama offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin’s attack on Nov. 7. \n3.BRANDON HARRIS VS. WESTERN KENTUCKY SECONDARY – This could be the LSU quarterback’s last chance to air it out a bit to get ready for the big games – Alabama on Nov. 7 after an open date this week, Ole Miss on Nov. 21 and Texas A&M on Nov. 28. Western Kentucky is 106th in the nation in passing defense with 265.4 yards allowed a game. \n4. LSU DEFENSIVE LINE – The Tigers need to pressure Western Kentucky’s quarterback to make the secondary’s job easier. But Doughty has been sacked just once in his last three games because he gets rid of the ball so quick. LSU defensive end Lewis Neal, who is second in the SEC with seven sacks, needs to do something about that. \n5. WATCH THE FAKE – LSU coach Les Miles tends to like to put a few years between his fakes, and he just called one of his best ever last week. So, that’s all the more reason for the Mad Hatter to try one this week since Western Kentucky won’t be expecting it. And it will give Alabama one more fake to worry about. \n“He should wear a top hat I think,” said LSU kicker Trent Domingue, who scored the winning touchdown on a 16-yard run off a fake field goal in the fourth quarter of a 35-28 win over Florida Saturday. “They give him the name the Mad Hatter for a reason.” \nPREDICTION: Fournette breaks the record with 281 yards because he has to as Western Kentucky keeps scoring before falling, 38-27.
