He said he was overanxious playing at the Garden for his first time.\n“We’re pretty hopeful we’ll have him back by Friday [against Boston],’’ Fisher said.\nThe Sixers were also not going to play Jahlil Okafor, the No. 3 pick in the draft, selected one slot before Porzingis.\nOkafor has looked heavy during the preseason. Porzingis and Okafor battled during the Las Vegas summer league, with the Latvian blocking three of his shots.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under kristaps porzingis ,  new york knicks", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:32:26.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
