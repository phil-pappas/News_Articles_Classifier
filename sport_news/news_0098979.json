Everything is working great. I’m very grateful for the opportunity to be able to play this well, to be successful,” he said. \n“I don’t want to get carried away by success obviously because I want to be playing on this level for many more years to come.” \nFederer lost only four times in 2005, achieving one of the best winning percentages on record and claiming two grand slams, but an ankle injury stopped him closing out the year in style. \nJohn McEnroe had only three defeats in 1984, one in the French Open final, compiling the best winning percentage in the Open era of 0.965. Ten years earlier, Jimmy Connors went 93-4. \nDjokovic has become only the third man, after Federer and Rod Laver, to reach all four grand slam finals in the same year. \nHis points tally of 16,785, nearly double that of second-placed Murray, is a tour record, as is his prize money, set to top $US16 million ($A22 million). \nIt might not be long before he challenges Nadal’s tally of 14 majors and strives for Federer’s record of 17. \n“Every time I step on the court, knowing I’ve had an amazing record this season and also in these tournaments in the previous years makes me play my best and makes me come out on the court with less doubts in my mind, I would say,” Djokovic said. \nJust don’t ask him how opponents can beat him. \n“It’s a good question, but I have no answer,” smiled the Serb.
