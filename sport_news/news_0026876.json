The Sooners will look to continue their recent success at the regional championships. A Sooner has won the singles title in each of the last five years, including last season’s repeat performance from senior Axel Alvarez. In total, OU won 17 matches in last season’s tournament. Junior Alex Ghilea will look to carry the torch for Oklahoma. Ghilea is the highest ranked Sooner in the field at No. 50 and drew the tournament’s No. 3 overall seed. Ghilea will have a bye in the first round of singles and is slated to play the winner of Carlos Bautista of Tulsa and Chris Schindler of Nebraska not before 3 p.m. Thursday. Ghilea is 3-2 in singles so far this fall. Two other Sooners join Ghilea in Fayetteville. Junior Sam Gray is slated to face Shane Trebisky of SIUC in the round of 124 not before noon and redshirt freshman John Milstead will square off with Alex Koca of Creighton not before 11 a.m. Sophomore Spencer Papa and senior Austin Siegel were slated to compete this weekend as well but withdrew. Papa was the tournament’s No. 9 overall seed.
