(Ozarks Sports Zone) -- Tonya Peck didn’t need to say much to motivate her team entering Thursday’s Mid-Lakes showdown with Strafford. Naturally, there’s the Fair Grove-Strafford rivalry, one of the best in the Ozarks. Both teams entered with lengthy winning streaks, with Fair Grove, ranked No. 6 in Class 2 holding on to a 10-game streak and Strafford, ranked No. 2 in Class 2, entering with a 13 consecutive wins. The Lady Indians had dropped just one set since Aug. 29. The winner put itself in position to likely win the Mid-Lakes title and grab the top seed in Class 2 – District 10. But, if that wasn’t enough, there was always last year, when Strafford ended Fair Grove’s season and the Lady Eagles’ bid for back-to-back Final Four runs. A loss that Haley Stallings still hasn’t quite gotten over.“Honestly, nothing has ever felt worse,” said Stallings. “I walked into the locker room and the reality of the loss kicked in. At that moment I realized my junior season was over, there was no second chance; that was it. Coach had us come in the next morning and write letters to ourselves to describe how we felt. I remember writing about how it just felt like everything that we had worked so hard for that season had just been taken from us in just one game. The seniors made a decision that this year we are not going to feel this way again.” After the two powerhouses split the first two sets it seemed like history was repeating itself, as Fair Grove watched the Lady Indians recover from a 7-1 deficit, scoring eight straight and 15 of 23 to force a 16-16 tie until a message in an earlier timeout resonated with the Lady Eagles.“My kids have done a great job all year keeping their composure and staying calm,” said Fair Grove head coach Tonya Peck. “We do scenarios in practice all the time and this is one of them, where we are down six or seven points and have to come back. I just told them to calm down. We have done this before, we did it yesterday in practice, let’s just do it now.” Peck’s team scored nine of the set’s final 11 points, earning a 21-25, 25-23, 25-18 road win against Strafford on the very same court that their season ended just 11 months ago.

FAIR GROVE – CLICK HERE The win also marked the seventh time in the last nine meetings that Fair Grove has defeated Strafford with Peck winning four of five against former Missouri State standout Ashley Bough.“Strafford’s great and we knew that coming in and we knew what we had to do; Ashley’s done a great job with that program,” said Peck. “That was a fun game. The atmosphere was great, it was back and forth with two talented teams. Volleyball is crazy. But, we’ve got to continue to play. I told the girls that this isn’t the end and we need to build on this.” Strafford started the night on fire, scoring 11 of the game’s first 15 points using a variety of different hitters. Entering the match, Strafford’s four top hitters all had 70-94 kills with at least a .290 hitting percentage. All-stater Chloe Rear, who finished with a team-high 14 kills, was joined by senior Kaylee Larimer and juniors Rilie Vote and Gracie Morton in attacking from all angles and keeping Fair Grove guessing defensively.“It’s a great thing to have that kind of balance,” said Bough. “I told them we need to mix it up and use our offense. In that first set Rilie and Chloe didn’t get set that often and we won. Having those kinds of options is great.” Fair Grove rallied, but never really threatened Strafford in the first set, which couldn’t have been more the opposite in the second set, with the Lady Eagles jumping out to an 11-5 lead. Strafford responded by scoring six of nine, creating a trend for a back and forth set. Setting up Fair Grove’s third-set rally was the incredible run by Strafford after falling behind 7-1, forcing Bough to call a timeout.“I’ve learned that I can get down and be negative but that usually doesn’t help the situation,” said Bough. “I told them they can either feel defeated and give up or they could see the advantage of winning that first set and being on our home court and come out with some fire. They get so focused on the score so we really preached just worrying about the next play.” Bough was less than satisfied with the loss, but is hopeful that her team understands that the season is far from over. Roughly a year ago Strafford was in the exact same position, losing the Mid-Lakes title with a loss to Fair Grove, but bouncing back to beat the Lady Eagles in the district championship, a season that would end with a school-record 35 wins and Class 2 Elite Eight run before losing to eventual state champ MV-BT/Liberty in the quarterfinals.“The good thing about this time of year is that it’s not over year and hopefully we’ll have a chance to play them again,” said Bough. “You can’t live on your mistakes; you have got to keep moving forward. It hurts to lose and yes I’m mad about losing but I’m going to take what I’ve learned and use it as motivation moving forward and I want them to do the same. I have all the faith in the world that my kids will respond. They’ll come back, work hard and put themselves in a position to make those plays the next time they’re in that situation.” Just two wins shy of a seventh consecutive 20-win season, Peck and Fair Grove continue to put together another sensational season, which has now become a routine thing for the Lady Eagles. But, with a senior class that that has two MLC championships, two district titles and a Final Four run under its belt already, along with 104 wins and counting. The play of all-state seniors Stallings and Jorden Stacey has been expected, but the emergence of freshman Alana Findley, who leads Fair Grove in kills and blocks, has provided a spark at the net that gives Fair Grove the necessary firepower to make a Final Four run. Peck hopes that this is just one of several marquee wins in what could be a historic season.“I’ve been telling our girls if you want it you have to work for it and they definitely did that tonight,” said Peck. “Obviously I know they want it, but I don’t think they realize how much I want it for them as well. It has nothing to do with me; I just want it for them so bad. This has been a special, special group of kids.” Strafford will travel to Conway in nonconfenrence action on Monday, while Fair Grove will look to continue an unblemished Mid-Lakes run with a visit from Ash Grove.
