They allegedly purchased legitimate cards for $1, placed unlimited or monthly rides on them and then sold them to riders at discounted cash prices, according to the indictment.\nMelvin Summers Jr. Summers is the son of one of the co-defendants indicted in June 2014 , James said. Melvin Summers Jr., Jedadia Byrd, Robert Clark, Christina Carney, Michael Dallas, Stephanie Finger and Pierre Metteaux face felony racketeering charges for a similar scheme, James said. Dallas has already entered a guilty plea.\nThe first group of alleged computer hackers was arrested in December 2013. MARTA Police Chief Wanda Dunham said more than 400 cards had been seized.\nMembers of the first group indicted referred to the alleged scam as the “Underground Railroad,” according to the indictment.\nDistributors were stationed at various MARTA terminals to sell the cards at H.E. Holmes, Five Points, Chamblee and Doraville stations, according to the indictment.\nThe first set of indictments are expected to go to trial early next year, James said.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2013/12/27/50/fb/melvinsummersjr.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T14:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:03:15.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
