The book is 25 years old. The passage spans all of two sentences on Page 244 of “Raw Recruits,” and it has sat there largely unnoticed and publicly undisputed for a quarter of a century.\nUntil now.\nBut in the wake of allegations of staff-sponsored escort services for University of Louisville basketball players and recruits, a tale from Rick Pitino’s distant past has resurfaced with embarrassing implications and rapid denials.\nAccording to the 1990 book written by Alexander Wolff and Armen Keteyian, Pitino’s Boston University team made at least one unscheduled stop following a road game for adult entertainment.\n“After one upset victory at Rhode Island,” the book says, “Pitino was so juiced he ordered the team bus to stop at a strip joint on the way back to campus. There he led his players in wolf whistles, even disbursing dollar bills so they could stuff them into the dancers’ G-strings.”\nThe story is unattributed and, according to Pitino, largely fictitious. Yet in the context of Katina Powell’s claims about being paid to provide team sex services by U of L’s former director of basketball operations, Andre McGee, it amounts to more fuel on a growing wildfire.\n“It never happened,” U of L spokesman Kenny Klein said after consulting with Pitino. “The team walked in to get food, thinking it was a restaurant. They found out it wasn’t and walked out.”\nWhether the specific details are still relevant 35 years after the fact is a fair question with no definitive answer. Rick Pitino is certainly a different guy at age 63 than he was at 27, less brash, more chastened, less impulsive, more mature. Still, given the documented indiscretions already on Pitino’s record, any additional allegations of past improprieties could make his future more tenuous.\nThe only trip that could meet the description outlined in “Raw Recruits” involved a Jan. 24, 1980 game at Rhode Island that Pitino’s Terriers won, 74-63. Though Boston University was 3-0 against Rhode Island during Pitino’s tenure, his other two victories against the Rams took place in 1979, in Boston, and in an early round of the 1980 ECAC North Tournament in Portland, Maine.\nBasketball analyst Glenn Consor, a captain on BU’s 1979-80 team, disputed the “Raw Recruits” anecdote when contacted Wednesday through social media.\n\"Do not remember ever going to a strip club after a game,” he wrote. “In fact, I don't remember ever stopping anywhere after a game. We always went back to Boston.”\nWolff, a staff writer at Sports Illustrated, said he would seek permission before sharing the source of the strip joint story, but that so much time had elapsed that he could no longer remember who it was.\n“The book was thoroughly vetted and lawyered,” Wolff said. “We were sued, but we had our ducks in a row, and the plaintiff ended up dropping the suit.\n“... I will say the Rick Pitino who is portrayed in the book, it was a different era, and he was on the make. The point of that anecdote is to show that he was a hard-charging coach. If there’s any lesson here, it’s that it was a long time ago.”\nKeteyian, now a correspondent for CBS and Showtime’s “60 Minutes Sports,” has digested Katina’s Powell’s claims from the perspective of an author whose most recent book, “The System,” describes similarly sexually charged recruiting practices.\n“It details the hostess program at the University of Tennessee under Lane Kiffen through the eyes of Lacey Pearl Earps, who was the uber-hostess of the football program her senior year,” Keteyian wrote in an e-mail Wednesday. “Lacey was singularly responsible for Bryce Brown, then the top running back recruit in the country, signing with UT. ... While Lacey said she never slept with a player she made clear the overriding sexual intimation with top recruits was: ‘You come to our school and this is what you can expect to get.’\n“Another hostess, Charlotte ‘Charli’ Henry, told me she left the UT hostess program after one year because she felt pressured to sleep with incoming recruits, to do ‘whatever it takes’ to help the program.”\nIn some ways, Keteyian suggested, the allegations against Louisville are more innocent because they involve prostitutes rather than students.\n\"On the surface, it appears Louisville just skipped a sexy hostess program and went straight to the professionals,” he wrote. “And given the high-stakes world of college basketball recruiting – and I'm not trying to be glib about this – it makes sense. This is like Hostess 5.0.\"\nWolff’s impression of the current crisis is that Pitino “sounded like someone who really didn’t know what was going on.” In that, he and Pitino’s first BU point guard are in agreement.\n“I (have) and always will have Rick's back,” Consor wrote. “He made me into the best player I could possibly be, and toughened me up when I needed it. Knowing him like I do, I do not believe he knew anything about this escort. He would never approve of something like that. No way.”\nTim Sullivan can be reached at (502) 582-4650, tsullivan@courier-journal.com or @TimSulllivan714 on Twitter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:31:08.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
