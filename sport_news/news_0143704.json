(Courtesy Photo - MCLA) \nNORTH ADAMS &GT;&GT; Tony Skiffington said he has a six-month job \"interview\" at MCLA. \nSkiffington was named interim head coach of the men's basketball team, replacing Jamie Morrison, who stepped down officially Monday morning. \nSkiffington spent the last five years on Morrison's staff. He has been an assistant basketball coach at Hoosac Valley and McCann Tech and a former assistant football coach at Hoosac, along with coaching youth sports in Northern Berkshire County. \n\"I definitely want to do this longer than this year,\" Skiffington told the Eagle Monday afternoon. \"I had numerous discussions with [MCLA athletic director Laura Mooney] and she wanted to do this on an interim basis. I didn't expect anything more. \n\"I told her that I'm looking at this basically as a six-month interview. I have a great opportunity that some guys who might come in for an interview don't have.\" \nMorrison submitted his resignation earlier this month, but it became official on Monday. Morrison finished seven years at MCLA, and while he had a 65-117 record in those seven years, he was 17-58 in his first three years. That stint includes a 17-10 season in 2010-11, and a berth in the ECAC New England Division III semifinals. Two years later, Morrison guided the Trailblazers to a 14-13 mark and they got to the MASCAC title game. The Trailblazers lost to Fitchburg State 80-72, for the right to play in the NCAA Division III Tournament.

Haskell is the only 100% Native American university in the country that competes at the NCAA or NAIA level. \nBut after seven years in North Adams, Morrison said it was time for a change. \n\"The landscape has changed at MCLA a little bit,\" said Morrison. \"President [Mary] Grant is no longer here and [former athletic director Scott Nichols] is no longer here. There were some people on campus who were really great resources for our program have also departed in the last few months, or are getting ready to depart. \n\"I felt like it was time. The landscape has changed and maybe it was time for me to make a change as well.\" \nFor his part, Skiffington said that he's talked to the returning and incoming Trailblazers and said they're a little excited. \n\"I recruited pretty much most of these kids,\" said the interim coach. \"Of the [veterans], I didn't have a hand in recruiting Paul Maurice, but Khalil Paul, I recruited out of Troy (N.Y.) High School. He went to Columbia-Greene [Community College] and then came here. \n\"I have a great rapport with him and with some of the younger kids as well.\" \nThe Trailblazers will likely begin practice Monday night, Oct. 19. Skiffington said he will try to practice weeknights at 8 p.m. because that is in synch with their game times. MCLA opens its season at Southern Vermont on Friday, Nov. 13. MCLA will play the next four games at home, including a Nov. 24 date with Route 2 rival Williams. \nOf MCLA's first eight non-league games, six are against teams with winning records, two (Wesleyan, WPI) went to the NCAA Tournament and two others (NYU, Southern Vermont) played in the ECACs. \nAs to Morrison's future, the now former MCLA coach said he isn't going to coach anywhere in 2015-16, but he has a few potential job irons in the fire. If not, he'll go to watch basketball, work with teams and improve his coaching skills.
