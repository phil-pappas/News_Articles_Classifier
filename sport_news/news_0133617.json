The bobblehead captures the iconic image of Hunter falling from a stool on the sideline when Hunter’s son, RJ, sank a game-winning 3-pointer taking the number-14 seeded Panthers into the third round of the tournament over the third-seeded Baylor Bears last March. Coach Hunter had injured his leg a week earlier while celebrating the team’s victory in the Sun Belt Conference tournament, and had been forced to use a stool on the sidelines at practices and games as a result. “Like millions of Americans, I have always been captivated by the NCAA Tournament, and this was one of the most memorable moments this year,” said National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum CEO and co-founder Phil Sklar. “R.J.’s long-range three-pointer followed by Ron falling off his chair made Georgia State’s upset win even that much more memorable and exciting.” The cost of the bobbleheads are $25, plus shipping. $1 of the proceeds from sales of the bobbleheads will go to Samaritan’s Feet , a charity Coach Hunter has supported for nearly the past decade. Only 2,015 of the special edition bobbleheads have been produced, and each one is individually numbered. The bobbleheads are available online at www.bobbleheadhall.com/product/ronhunter . during the second round of the 2015 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament at Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena on March 19, 2015 in Jacksonville, Florida.
