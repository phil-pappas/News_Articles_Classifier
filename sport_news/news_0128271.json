But Whalen snapped the ball anyway to Anderson, who didnâ€™t seem to be expecting it and was grabbed immediately by Patriots running back Brandon Bolden for a 1-yard loss.\nOfficials also flagged the Colts for illegal formation, since none of the shifted players were on the line of scrimmage, but that was the least of their problems. The Patriots took over and quickly marched for a touchdown to make it a 13-point game early in the fourth quarter.\n\"The whole idea is on a 4th-and-three or less we would shift,\" Pagano said. \"Either catch them misaligned or with 12 men on the field.And if you get a certain look you can make a play.\n\"But we weren't lined up correctly and had a communication breakdown between the quarterback out there and the snapper. It's on me, I didn't coach it well enough.\"\nWas the ball suppose to be snapped?\n\"We were just going to take a delay of game,\" he said.\nVIDEO PLAYLIST: LATEST FROM THE NFL NFL Week 6 Bold Predictions: Lions will finally get a win | 01:22 USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero gives some predictions you might not be expecting.\n1 of 11 VIDEO PLAYLIST: LATEST FROM THE NFL NFL Week 6 Sunday Statement: What you need to know | 01:52 USA TODAY Sports' NFL reporters offer need-to-know analysis leading up to kickoff of Week 6 in the NFL, plus fantasy advice you can't miss.\n2 of 11 VIDEO PLAYLIST: LATEST FROM THE NFL NFL Inside Slant: Saints still alive | 00:59 USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero breaks down New Orleans' big win against Atlanta on Thursday night.
