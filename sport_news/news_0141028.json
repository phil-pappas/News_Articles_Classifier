The skid has put in peril their chance of getting home-field advantage in the NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. \nNew York and Los Angeles are among four teams in major league history to make the playoffs after getting no-hit twice in one season, according to STATS. The others were the 2010 Tampa Bay Rays and 1917 Chicago White Sox, who won the World Series.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T05:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:44:42.602+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
