Up next is a home game Friday night against UConn, which won its opening two games, but dropped in the last two weeks against Missouri and Navy. The Huskies are certainly beatable, but the Cougars will need to rebound quickly and start fast to shake off the cobwebs from last week. Here's a position-by-position look at this week's matchup and which team will have the edge heading into Friday's game:\n\nQuarterback\nTanner Mangum came back to reality last week after a sterling start to the season, throwing for only 55 yards and an average of two yards per attempt against the Wolverines. His receivers were almost entirely snuffed out by Michigan's coverage and extra weight will fall on him to win this game as BYU's top running backs deal with injuries. He'll have another tough matchup this week against the Huskies, who surrender only 125 yards passing per game.\n  \nN.C. State transfer Bryant Shirreffs is the guy under center for UConn. He's had a productive season with 847 yards and four touchdowns to only one interception while completing 65 percent of his passes. Shirreffs is also a rushing threat with 115 yards on the ground this season, a concern after BYU was chewed up by Michigan's rushing attack last week. Still, Mangum has better weapons and should rebound this week. \n\nEdge: BYU\n\nRunning back\nThe status of several BYU rushers is up in the air, Adam Hine likely slated to miss the game Friday night after suffering an ankle injury against Michigan. Algie Brown participated in pregame warmups against the Wolverines and would be invaluable if he could return against UConn, but his status is unknown as well. Up next are Francis Bernard and Carter, Bernard rushing for 30 yards on four carries last week. The Cougars will get a break this week facing a UConn team surrendering nearly 171 yards per game on the ground.\n\nSophomore Arkeel Newsome seized the lead back spot for the Huskies last week against Navy, rushing for 69 yards on 14 carries and adding 51 yards in the passing game. Ron Johnson was the top choice in the previous weeks, rushing for 131 yards and three touchdowns so far this season. Along with Shirreffs potential to break a run, the Huskies have an edge here. \n\nEdge: UConn\n\nWide receivers\nBYU's pass catchers were abysmal last week, getting lost in physical coverage to the tune of 12 total catches for 55 yards between nine receivers. The leader — Devon Blackmon — caught only one pass for 14 yards. UConn's pass defense is strong, but the Cougars have the variation in size and speed needed to exploit certain matchups to help Mangum out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:18:09.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
