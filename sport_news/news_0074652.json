She has written about the experience in a new book, “Tiger Heart.” File photo She calls the enterprise The Learning Tea and it has helped 11 young women with medical care, safe housing, tutoring and college educations.\nThe story of her journey is told in a memoir, “Tiger Heart,” a book that Christie wrote with Journal-Constitution reporter Shannon McCaffrey. Parts of the story first appeared last year as a two-part series in the AJC’s Sunday feature called Personal Journey.\nKatrell and McCaffrey will discuss the book and sign copies 7 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 15, at the Margaret Mitchel House Museum, in Midtown, 979 Crescent Avenue NE, Atlanta. Tickets are $10.
