(Photo: Submitted) \nEstero High’s cross country teams left the District 3A-12 championships at Palmetto Ridge on Wednesday with more than a few successes. \nThe girls won their first district title since realigning out of 3A-11, the boys finished third and each qualified for the Region 3A-3 meet in Holloway Park in Lakeland on Oct. 30. \n“Overall, it wasn't pretty but we got the job done,” Estero head coach Ben Pignatone said. “As a coach, you're never satisfied. I’m happy and I'm proud of them for the effort.” \nJunior Arye Beck captured his first district championship by leading the boys field in 16:37, a personal record by 10 seconds. It was also his first win since 2013 and arguably the biggest of his career. Senior Jake Dorn was seventh overall in 17:17. \n“That’s huge for his momentum going into the region,” Pignatone said. “He’s been having some great workouts and he’s a big team player. Hopefully he’ll get even faster.” \nIn the girls race, senior Daley Cline clinched her first district title, too, stepping over the finish in 19:37, just one second off her personal best in 2015. \nIt came after a second-place performance in 2014 and a third-place outing in 2013. She was followed by teammate Megan Giovanniello, who timed in at 19:47. Freshman Alayna Goll was seventh in 21:04. \n“I’m really proud of all of our girls,” Pignatone said. “Our fourth girl (Abigail Barroso) PR’ed by a lot. That will all help in the future when everyone gets to regions and states. I’m hoping these girls roll on and get faster.” \nFHSAA District 3A-12 1. Arye Beck, Estero, 16:372.
