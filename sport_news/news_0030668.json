BYU jumped on Houghtaling's team early and often, rendering Wagner helpless throughout the contest, particularly in the first half when the Cougars played a lot of their starters while forging a 49-0 lead.\nThose same starters were largely pulled for most of the second half, allowing Wagner a bit of success — most notably a touchdown drive that was capped with a 1-yard touchdown run from Matthias McKinnon.\n\"I think defensively some of the guys played OK,\" Houghtaling said. \"We just didn't finish enough plays or make enough plays.\"\nAs far as BYU's faster-tempo-type play aiding his team moving forward, Houghtaling said, “I hope so. We’re 0-7 now, so I hope it improves our play. I think maybe the team speed of BYU might help us next week. It’s unusual. We’ve never played a game like this, this late in the year. It could be a positive the rest of the way.”\nWhat will unquestionably serve as a positive, in Houghtaling's mind, is what his players were able to experience off the field.\n“With the exception of the game, the kids got to experience a lot that they probably never would have experienced had we not played the game,” Houghtaling said. “Most of the guys had never been out hereso with the exception of the last 60 minutes, I think they enjoyed it and it may be something they never do again in their lifetime.”\nDespite the timing of the game, and the apparent mismatch involved, Houghtaling feels it was in line with what he pitches his players before they sign on to play for Wagner.\n\"It was a great student-athlete experience,\" he said. \"We talk about that a lot in recruiting. Give these guys a chance to come out and play in front of a crowd like this, in this stadium with the tradition they have here. That's a huge advantage for those guys and it is going to help our program out down the road. It was a positive experience.\"\nEmail: bgurney@desnews.com\nTwitter: @BrandonCGurney", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team33.html"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:07:36.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
