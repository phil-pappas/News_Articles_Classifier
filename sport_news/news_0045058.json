Montgomerie tied for 15th at 3 under after a 72. Jeff Maggert, 39 points behind Montgomerie, withdrew during the second round because of a lingering left calf injury. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:29:06.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
