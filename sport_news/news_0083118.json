It was Joe Benedict’s night. The Sandy Creek sophomore rushed for six touchdowns and 205 yards on 24 carries and Sandy Creek ran past West Canada Valley 40-14 in a Class D crossover game on a rainy and windy Friday night at West Canada Valley schools. Benedict has rushed for nearly 1,000 yards and 17 touchdowns for the Comets (4-2 overall) this season. Sandy Creek has won four consecutive games. Josh Chapin scored both of the Indians’ touchdowns – one on the opening kickoff of the second half and another on a 70-yard run in fourth quarter. The loss snapped a three-game winning streak for West Canada Valley (4-2). Chapin finished with 111 yards rushing on 25 carries. Teammate Shawn Pierson added 53 yards rushing on 13 carries. Sandy Creek jumped out to a 21-0 lead in the first half. Benedict scored on runs of 6, 8 and 34 yards. He finished the half with 89 yards on 15 carries. West Canada Valley couldn’t get anything going early, gaining the first of its two first-half first downs early in the second quarter. Pierson had 33 yards rushing. Chapin added 22 yards on the ground in the half. The Indians were forced to punt three times and fumbled once in the half. A botched punt set up Sandy Creek’s first touchdown. Benedict continued to run in the second half, adding three more touchdowns. Chapin was able to find some room in the half, but West Canada Valley couldn’t slow down Sandy Creek. West Canada Valley closes out the regular season Oct. 17 at Class D East rival Westmoreland.
