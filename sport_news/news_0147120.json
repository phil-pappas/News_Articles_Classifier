(AP) - The Mississippi State Fair Commission has filed an emergency complaint seeking an injunction to force the Jackson Police Department to provide security during this year's annual fair, which begins Wednesday.\nThe Clarion-Ledger reports ( http://on.thec-l.com/1KR1LXg ) the police department announced this year it wouldn't provide the service during the fair because of budget cuts. Police Chief Lee Vance said it costs the city about $300,000 in personnel and overtime costs during the annual state fair. Vance said his department would continue with its normal police patrols during the fair.\nThe Hinds County Sheriff's Department is responsible for providing security on the fairgrounds during the fair, and that will continue. The city's police force normally assists with traffic and security outside the fair gates.\nA hearing is set for Tuesday on the Fair Commission's complaint.\nInformation from: The Clarion-Ledger, http://www.clarionledger.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://on.thec-l.com/1KR1LXg"], "published": "2015-10-05T14:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:22:58.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
