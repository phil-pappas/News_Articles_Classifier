(Darren Calabrese/The Canadian Press via AP). Texas Rangers' Adrian Beltre hits an RBI-single during the third inning of Game 1 of the American League Division Series baseball action against the Toronto Blue Jays in Toronto on Thursday, Oct. 8, 2015. ... \nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - Third baseman Adrian Beltre is a late addition to the Texas Rangers lineup for Game 4 of the AL Division Series. \nBeltre wasn't in manager Jeff Banister's initial starting lineup. But about an hour before the start of Monday's game against the Toronto Blue Jays, the Rangers announced that Beltre will start at third base and bat third. \nBeltre missed Games 2 and 3 after exiting early from the series opener Thursday with a strained lower back. \nBanister had said earlier Monday that Beltre had taken soft-toss swings in the batting cage, but that running was \"most problematic\" for Beltre. \nTexas leads the best-of-five series 2-1. The Blue Jays have to win Monday to force a deciding Game 5 in Toronto. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
