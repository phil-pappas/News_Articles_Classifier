It came on the final day of the season and capped a pennant race with enough drama to rival that of 1978.\nThe 1949 American League race included a big blown lead, a controversial call and a superstar leaving his hospital bed to help rescue his team.\nThe Yankees took the league lead on opening day and at first did not look likely to relinquish it. On July 15, they were up by six and a half games, and fans could be forgiven for looking forward to the World Series.\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage Blue Jays’ Title Leaves Buffalo Bills With Longest Playoff Drought OCT. 1, 2015 On Baseball: With Some Luck, the Flawed Yankees May Have a Prayer OCT. 1, 2015 Analysis: Mets Still Playing for Home-Field Edge SEPT. 30, 2015 But the lead gradually dribbled away. Despite more than their share of injuries, the Yankees had a good August, finishing the month 17-12. But the Red Sox were better at 23-8. September was much the same story. It did not help that the great Joe DiMaggio was out for three crucial weeks with pneumonia. (He also missed the first two months of the season with a heel injury.)\nPhoto Yankees pitcher Vic Raschi was surrounded by his teammates after they beat the Red Sox. Credit Associated Press On Sept. 25 the lead was gone, after the Sox beat the Yanks, 4-1, at Fenway behind Ted Williams’s 43rd home run and a four-hitter by Mel Parnell.\nStill hopeful Yankees fans thronged Grand Central Terminal to greet the team as it arrived that night from Boston on Track 17. “So aggressive were the fans in their efforts to reach the ball players,” The New York Times wrote, “that the police and station guards had to escort several of the team to side exits to avoid accidental injury to the already crippled squad.”\nThe optimistic fans had their hopes dashed the next night at Yankee Stadium. The Sox took over first place with a 7–6 win, Johnny Pesky scoring on a squeeze by Bobby Doerr . The call of safe at the plate incensed the Yankees. Outfielder Cliff Mapes, who had not even played in the game, confronted plate umpire Bill Grieve afterward, and the two had to be separated. “How much did you bet on the game?” Mapes yelled.\nUmpire Cal Hubbard ( described as “exasperated” by The Times) opined: “How can a team that walks two men, makes an error and then fails to cover first base on a play blame the umpires for losing? Bah!”\nYankees players and Manager Casey Stengel were fined a total of $500 for their intemperance.\nThe Yanks won two of three against the Philadelphia Athletics, and the Red Sox matched that in Washington. Boston’s lead was still one game with two to play.\nThe tension in the pennant race riveted both cities. In an article on reaction in New England to the Soviet Union getting the bomb, The Quote: : “People appeared almost unanimous in their opinion that if the Russians had the atomic bomb and intended to use it, there was nothing that they, individually, could do about it. A more immediate pressing concern was whether Ted Williams of the Boston Red Sox would hit any home runs against the New York Yankees.”\nContinue reading the main story Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Pneumonia had put DiMaggio in the hospital, and he had lost 18 pounds, but he decided it was time to return. The Yankees proclaimed it Joe DiMaggio day, and for an hour before the game he was lauded and showered with gifts, including 300 quarts of ice cream and a speedboat . His brother Dom, who played for Boston, stood at his side, at times helping him to stay upright .\nDiMaggio was penciled in at the cleanup spot, but it was the Red Sox who jumped into the lead, 4-0, chasing starter Allie Reynolds in the third inning. But the Yankees’ ace reliever, Joe Page, held them scoreless the rest of the way, and the Yankees fought back to tie it, with DiMaggio scoring the first run after hitting a ground-rule double. The tie was broken in the eighth inning when the unsung left fielder Johnny Lindell homered, and the Yanks hung on to win, 5-4.\nThe pennant race was tied with one game to go. The final game of the year, Oct. 2 in Yankee Stadium, would determine whether Boston or New York played in the World Series.\nThe Yankees grabbed a 1-0 lead in the first, thanks to a leadoff triple by shortstop Phil Rizzuto (invariably referred to as “Little” or even “Lil” Phil in the newspapers of the day). Starter Vic Raschi, known as the Springfield Rifle, held the slim lead. In the eighth, the Yanks seemed to lock up the game with four runs, including a Tommy Henrich home run.\nBut the Red Sox season was not quite done. In the ninth inning, Doerr socked a two-run triple over the head of DiMaggio, who had not looked his best running or throwing in the outfield. At that point, DiMaggio who was 0 for 3 since a first-inning triple, took himself out of the game, complaining of shin pain. “Gosh, we had only a three-run lead, and I didn’t want to hurt the club by falling on my face if another fly had been hit to me,” he said.\nThe Sox got one more, but Raschi knuckled down and got the outs that won the game, 5-3 , and the pennant. The Red Sox had lost by a single game for the second straight year.\nOver in the National League, the Brooklyn Dodgers assured a Subway Series by winning their pennant on the final day as well. DiMaggio was only 2 for 18, but the Yankees won the series, four games to one, the first of five straight World Series titles for the Bombers.\nFor the Red Sox, who had come so close to glory, the future was not as bright. Boston would not make its next World Series appearance until 1967 and would not win again until 2004.\nNow the Yankees again face a season coming down to a single game. It will be decided by Alex Rodriguez, not Johnny Lindell, and Masahiro Tanaka, not Vic Raschi, but as usual with the Yankees, the weight of history will not be too far away.\nLoading...
