His insights and perspective on the Red Sox organization and the players make him one of the best analysts in the game.”\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below Remy’s workload in 2016 will be fewer games than he has usually broadcast in a season in which he did not miss time for health reasons or personal matters. Dennis Eckersley and Steve Lyons are also expected to serve as color analysts for a number of games next season. The broadcast will feature a three-man booth for some games, with Eckersley or Lyons joining Remy and O’Brien.\nRemy will be joined by a new partner in the booth. Dave O’Brien, who spent nine seasons on the Red Sox’ radio broadcasts on WEEI, is replacing longtime play-by-play voice Don Orsillo in the booth. The move caused significant backlash when news broke in late August that NESN did not intend to bring Orsillo back.\nOrsillo, who formed a popular tandem with Remy for 15 years, has since joined the San Diego Padres’ broadcast team.\n“NESN and the Red Sox have been very good to me over the years and I hope to continue for a long period of time what I consider to be the best job in the world of broadcasting,” said Remy in a statement. “I also look forward to welcoming my new play-by-play partner Dave O’Brien to the NESN team.”\nRemy, who turns 63 in November, has been associated with the Red Sox organization for 37 years—eight as a player, one as a minor league coach, and the past 28 as a NESN broadcaster.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:05:11.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
