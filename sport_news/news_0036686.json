But that \"after years of uncertainty about the Dodgers' long-term commitment to him -- Mattingly has worked under two different ownership groups and two different general managers -- he informed the team earlier this week that he preferred to move on.\" \nLos Angeles was 446-363 under Mattingly, finishing with a winning record in every season and winning the last three NL West titles. But the Dodgers have not reached the World Series since winning the championship in 1988. \nThe 54-year-old former Yankees star ranks sixth in wins among Dodgers managers. He was a holdover from the previous front office regime, having been manager Joe Torre's hand-picked successor in 2010 after he coached under the Hall of Famer for seven seasons in New York and Los Angeles. \nThe franchise with baseball's highest payroll, a record $289.6 million as of the end of the regular season, managed just two playoff victories before losing 3-2 to the New York Mets in a decisive Game 5 of their NL Division Series last week. \nInformation from the Associated Press was used in this report", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:15:49.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
