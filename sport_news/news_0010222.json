(Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images) \nTORONTO – In the spring of 2013, Chris Young reported to Viera, Fla. for his first of two spring trainings with the Washington Nationals. An accomplished major leaguer diminished by injury, he pitched for a couple months at Class AAA Syracuse. He came down with a hard-to-solve shoulder problem. He recovered. He didn’t pitch in the major leagues for more than a year. \nThe experience seems wholly separated from the circumstance Young finds himself in now. It is not, he assures people. Tuesday afternoon at Rogers Centre, Young will take the mound for the Kansas City Royals in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series. At the apex, Young draws a connection to his nadir. \n“Without that opportunity with the Nationals,” Young said, “I’m not sure I would be here.” \nYoung credits the Nationals with ferrying him from the potential downside of his career back to prominence. When Young arrived with the Nationals in 2013 on a minor league deal, he had yet to recover from a confounding shoulder injury he suffered with the New York Mets in 2012. \nThe nature of Young’s injury initially confused the Nationals’ medical staff, too, when they shut him down in Syracuse. The Nationals helped Young find a specialist who diagnosed him with thoracic outlet syndrome. He underwent surgery and rehabbed under the Nationals’ watch. General Manager Mike Rizzo brought Young back in 2014. Given the Nationals’ loaded rotation, Young took the opportunity as a chance to showcase his health. \n“I’m extremely grateful to the Nationals for that,” Young said Monday evening. “Mike Rizzo was just tremendous. He even made calls to teams at the end of camp, when he said, ‘You’re not going to make our staff, but you belong in the big leagues.’ And it led to the opportunity in Seattle. Like I said, I don’t know if I’d be here without that. It was tremendous of them to do that.” \nYoung landed with the Seattle Mariners, and over 29 starts – his first big league action since 2012 – he punched up a 3.65 ERA. The Royals scoped him up this winter at age 36 for $675,000 plus incentives, and he became one of the best bargains in baseball. In 123 1/3 innings spent swinging between the bullpen and rotation, Young posted a 3.06 ERA and a 1.086 WHIP. \nThe Royals chose Young over Kris Medlen because he allowed one earned run over 11 1/3 innings in his final two regular season starts, and Manager Ned Yost believed he pitched well against the Blue Jays as he allowed three runs in six innings in his lone start against them, back in July. “We feel like he gives us a good chance to win,” Yost said. \nAnd so here is Young, still throwing deceptive, chest-high fastballs at age 36, a 6-foot-10 survivor. He kept going hoping it would end with a moment like a playoff start. That is what he has now. \n“I love the game,” Young said. “It’s just the element of competition, being out there. As I said, there’s nothing that I found that I love more to do for a living than playing baseball. And I’m just grateful for everything the game has given me and the opportunity to continue to play. Certainly there have been some challenges, it’s not the way you’d script a career, by any means. But hopefully the best is yet to come.” Adam Kilgore covers national sports for the Washington Post.
