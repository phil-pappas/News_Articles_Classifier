When T.J. Ward blitzes, he should come with a warning label. He morphs into a hybrid: part linebacker, part defensive back, full on rage. \nFacing a potential upset, clock ticking toward its death, Ward bolted from the left side Sunday, sacking Minnesota's Teddy Bridgewater, stripping the ball and protecting the Broncos' undefeated record. \nWard celebrated with his right hand in the air followed by a mudwalk celebration toward the sideline. For the second consecutive week, the coaches voted Ward the Broncos' defensive player of the game. He leads NFL defensive backs with two sacks. He has made three tackles for losses. \n\"Heck yeah it does matter. It means more to me now than ever before,\" Ward said of the staff's recognition. \"You are playing with so many great players, guys like (DeMarcus Ware) DWare, Von (Miller), Aqib (Talib), Chris (Harris), for me to have the most plays made, that means a lot.\" \nWhen the Broncos signed Ward to a four-year, $22.5-million contract, this is the player they sought. A thumper, a playmaker. \n\"I wasn't allowed to be that guy last year,\" Ward said Monday. \nWard carried out his role last season for defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio, exercising restraint, following the plan. It turned him into an undersized linebacker rather than a disruptive safety. Del Rio left to become the coach of the Oakland Raiders, this Sunday's opponent, and took his 4-3 defense with him. Defensive coordinator Wade Phillips installed a 3-4 alignment, emphasizing pressure. Advertisement \nIt caffeinated Ward. \n\"Why do I like blitzing? Because I am good at it,\" said Ward. \nTeammates witnessed it early in the offseason. They recognized in practice that Phillips' philosophy would increase Ward's impact. \n\"T.J. can blitz, man. That's what he do,\" cornerback Aqib Talib said. \"He plays around that box (with the linebackers). Wade knows what he can do, and he puts him in position to do what he does best. We definitely knew this was coming.\" \nThe strategy appears to be working. Ward owns 19 tackles, 13 solo, in three games. At 5-foot-11, 200 pounds, Ward brings a physical presence. But his intelligence sets him apart. What might look like freelancing is controlled chaos. On the Vikings' final snap, Ward crept toward the line of scrimmage next to outside linebacker Von Miller. \nWard refused to reveal too much to Bridgewater. He stood opposite of the tight end, creating the impression he was in man coverage. On the snap, Ward read running back Adrian Peterson. Once he fanned out for a pass, Ward finished like Mariano Rivera, bringing closure to another nervy Sunday. \n\"It's all about timing and anticipating who is going to block you, and beating the block,\" Ward said. \"I thought I had a chance to get loose. I knew that Adrian Peterson was going to block me. Once he went out on the route, I knew I was free.\" \nWard earned Pro Bowl honors last season but wasn't himself. His personality fits the current defense's aggression and expectations. The Broncos lead the NFL with 18 sacks by 11 players. And Ward remains convinced they've left meat on the bone. \n\"We are trying to get more. Yes, more. I am telling you we have missed a bunch of sacks,\" Ward said. \"We missed about seven on Sunday.\" \nThis season began in a way inconceivable to Ward. He was suspended one game for violating the personal conduct policy for an incident 15 months prior when he was charged with misdemeanor assault and disturbing the peace. The charges were dropped in a plea deal. Ward took responsibility for his actions. Missing the opener — he was \"miserable\" watching the Baltimore Ravens from home — sprinkled kerosene on his fire this season. \n\"His level of leadership, his passion for the game, it's obvious,\" free safety Darian Stewart said. \"What he brings is big for us. It's what we need. We feed off it.\" \nTroy E.
