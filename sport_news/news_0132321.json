A swoon in 2011 when a Pirates team that had stood first in late July staggered the rest of the way, losing 43 of its final 62 games.\nAnother flop in 2012, when the Pirates were first in late July and remained strong playoff contenders in mid-August before dropping 36 of their final 52 games for a 20th straight losing season, had a similarly unsettling effect.\n\"When we finished poorly, it undid a lot of the good from a fan basis and media basis that we had created by being in first place late in July,\" Huntington said. \"We believed we were doing some good things to establish a foundation, but success just doesn't happen fast enough at the major-league level for anybody.\"\nExcept maybe Gerrit Cole. The Pirates took Cole, a right-handed pitcher, as the first overall pick in the 2011 amateur draft. He made his major-league debut June 11, 2013. Four months later, after the Pirates again started fast (26 games over .500 on Aug. 8) and hung in enough to stay there with a 94-68 final record, he would be starting two games in a National League Division Series the Pirates lost to the Cardinals three games to two.\n\"What a ride that was,\" Cole said.\nIt hasn't stopped.\nCole, now the team's pitching ace at 25, is scheduled to be the starting pitcher in Wednesday's wild-card game against the Cubs as the Pirates make their third straight postseason appearance after a 20-year drought that included seven last-place finishes. Only the Cardinals (five) and Dodgers (three) have active postseason streaks as long or longer than Pittsburgh's.\nThe Tribune's Mark Gonzales picks out his top 15 moments from the Cubs' special season.\n\"It was a big deal to make it two years ago,\" Cole said. \"Now it's kind of expected. We have built that sustainable kind of success.\"\nThey have done it with a core group of players who have grown together while adding enough veterans to help get the team over its psychological hump.\nThe starting infield and outfield has six players either drafted (three in the first round) or originally signed by the Pirates. That includes the team's lone 2015 All-Star position player, center fielder Andrew McCutchen, 28, a first-round draft pick 10 years ago.\n\"When you're struggling as an organization, it's tough to see the plan, but everyone believed in it,\" said second baseman Neil Walker, 30, whom the Pirates took in the first round of the 2004 draft. \"Going through '11 and '12, having some success and then finishing in a bad way, prepared us for '13 and '14 and now.\"\nMcCutchen is among four current Pirates who endured the 105-loss season and the successive fades that followed.\nJoe Maddon on Cubs' 'phenomenal' season, playing on the road Joe Maddon on Cubs' 'phenomenal' season, playing on the road.\nJoe Maddon on Cubs' 'phenomenal' season, playing on the road.\nSee more videos \"Nothing was discouraging,\" McCutchen insisted. \"We continued to improve, even if the record may not have said that. We learned, we learned, we learned, we got better, and we knew what to expect.\"\nCole and relievers Tony Watson, 30, and Jared Hughes, 29, all are organization products. But the pitching staff includes three key players from other teams, starters Francisco Liriano and A.J. Burnett (both free agents) and closer Mark Melancon (trade). Liriano, 31, and Burnett, 38, came to the Pirates — in Burnett's case, came and then came back — with the postseason experience to temper the anxieties of the playoff newbies.\n\"One of the biggest assets I felt we had as an organization and there still was a passionate fan base,\" Huntington said. \"That passion showed itself in anger and venom at times our first handful of years here.\"\nTheo Epstein and Jed Hoyer heard the same from Cubs fans for the first three years after taking over as, respectively, the Cubs' president and general manager after the 2011 season. The first winning season under their regime also has taken the team to the playoffs, as it had done for Huntington in Pittsburgh.\nIn other ways, the Cubs and Pirates have achieved their current success similarly, with a core of homegrown position players to which key starters (in the Cubs' case, Jon Lester and Jake Arrieta) and the current catcher (Miguel Montero) have been added through free agency or trades.\nA big difference is money. The Cubs gave Lester, 31, a nine-figure, six-year contract when he signed as a free agent last December. In trading for Montero, 32, six days earlier, the Cubs took on $40 million for the final three seasons of a six-year contract he had signed with the Diamondbacks.\nWe were not able to go out and spend $155 million on a pitcher,\" Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said, referring to Lester. \"In the free-agent market, I don't think we will be shopping in the same stores.\"\nLike many small-market teams, the Pirates face considerable payroll constraints.\nThey could afford four-time All-Star catcher Russell Martin for two seasons but lost him as a free agent in 2015 to Toronto. The Blue Jays gave Martin a five-year deal that averages $18.75 million over the final four seasons.\nHis replacement, Francisco Cervelli, who came in a trade with the Yankees and has another season before free agency, is making $988,000 in 2015. Cervelli finished the regular season with an OPS and WAR just slightly below Martin's numbers: .771 to .787 and 3.1 to 3.3.\n\"Every team in baseball needs to create its own regulars and its own starting pitchers,\" Huntington said. \"But smaller markets need more of their own players, they need to hit more consistently on trades and even more consistently on the few free-agent acquisitions they make. When we miss on a free agent, we can't just go throw more money at the problem.\"\nThe Pirates paid Liriano, now the No. 2 starter behind Cole, $7 million combined his first two seasons, 2013 and 2014. With the team winning, they signed him through 2017 in a three-year, $39 million deal.\nMcCutchen has been considered one of the best young players in baseball since going 2-for-4 in his 2009 major-league debut. In 2012, he signed a six-year deal worth what now seems a bargain $51.5 million.\nAnother significant difference between the Pirates and Cubs is postseason appearances.\nSince 1908, when the Cubs last won the World Series, the Pirates have won five, most recently in 1979. Since 1945, when the Cubs last won the National League pennant, the Pirates have won three (and the three ensuing World Series).\nBut, for better and (largely) for worse, the Cubs reached the postseason four times and had nine winning seasons during the Pirates' 20-year failure to do either. Now the Pirates are looking to go deeper than their division series loss in 2013 and wild-card game loss in 2014.\nHuntington dumped his first managerial selection, John Russell, for Hurdle after 2010. What seemed to be turning into a magical Pirates debut for Hurdle proved only ephemeral sleight-of-hand both that year and the next because of lack of depth and the young players' inexperience with handling the mental and physical grind and pressurized end of a long season.\n\"It is kind of like if your car is on the side of the road,\" Hurdle said. \"To get it moving, you've got to push it. To start the push is hard. Really hard. Once you get the tires rolling, it becomes much easier.\"\nThen, as Cole put it, what a ride.\nphersh@tribpub.com\nTwitter @olyphil\n Major League Baseball Pittsburgh Pirates Chicago Cubs Free Agency Gerrit Cole Andrew McCutchen Francisco Liriano", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5611b63f/turbine/ct-joe-maddon-on-cubs-phenomenal-season-playing-on-the-road-20151004", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5612cf8b/turbine/ct-pirates-cubs-sustained-success-spt-1006-20151005", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56127bb3/turbine/ct-cubs-moments-2015-season-photos-20151002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56117eed/turbine/ct-cubs-moments-2015-season-photos-20151002-005", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560e92cc/turbine/ct-cubs-moments-2015-season-photos-20151002-006"], "published": "2015-10-05T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:58:40.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
