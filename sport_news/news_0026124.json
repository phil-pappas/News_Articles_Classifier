After Michigan's latest win, though, the coach couldn't help but heap praise. \n\"The fellas really came out ballin' right from the start,\" Harbaugh said.

They allowed a season-high 21 points in the first quarter alone and struggled on offense, too.

(AP Photo/Tony Ding) \n\"That definitely sparked everything,\" Peppers said. \nMichigan ran for scores on its first two possessions on Drake Johnson's 1-yard plunge and Jake Rudock's 2-yard scramble to make it 21-0. Jourdan Lewis picked off a pass, snatching the ball away from the intended target, late in the second quarter and returned it 37 yards for a score. \nKenny Allen kicked a career-long 47-yard field goal to cap the Wolverines' opening drive in the second half, giving them a 31-0 lead. Michigan padded the cushion with Derrick Green's 4-yard TD run that ended a 12-play possession that took 7-plus minutes off the clock.

Ross, a key reserve, will have to sit out the first half next week against the Spartans. \nRudock passed a test against a highly touted defense, completing 17 of 23 passes for 179 yards without a turnover. \n\"He's playing his best football,\" Harbaugh said. \"He's playing really confident, really good.\" Northwestern quarterback Clayton Thorson (18) looks downfield for a receiver during the first half of an NCAA college football game against Michigan, Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015, in Ann Arbor, Mich. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) \nMichigan's De'Veon Smith had eight carries for 59 yards, after missing a game with an injured right ankle, and likely would've played more if the game was close. \n\"We didn't want to put too much on him,\" Harbaugh said. \nA.J. Williams had four receptions, doubling his previous career high, for 48 yards and six other Wolverines also caught passes.

Justin Jackson was held to a career-low 25 yards rushing on 12 carries for the Wildcats, who were averaging a Big Ten-best 248.8 yards on the ground and were held to 38 at Michigan. \n\"That was one of the statements we wanted to make,\" Peppers said. \nThe Wildcats gave two other quarterbacks a chance to play, and none of them were able to do much against Michigan's defense.

So that's disappointing, obviously. It starts and ends with me.\" \n___ \nFollow Larry Lage at http://www.twitter.com/larrylage \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:06:21.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
