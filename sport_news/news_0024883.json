The Vikings' victory required an overtime period and resulted in some soaked spectators, but plenty of talent was on display on both teams. Below are news, notes and general takeaways from the game. I was impressed with... Florida commit Vosean Joseph is adding size. He's packed on roughly 10 pounds of what appears to be muscle since the onset of the season. The Miami Norland linebacker still has a way to go before he's physically ready to contribute in the SEC, but he's certainly on the right path. On Friday, he was the center of the Norland defense. He recorded a safety early in the game that accounted for his team's only first-half points and showcased some impressive closing speed. Joseph, who could often be seen providing words of encouragement to teammates, is clearly an on-field leader for an impressive Norland defense. It's impossible to coach the sort of length and frame that comes with Florida State commit Emmett Rice . Rice plays next to Joseph in the Norland linebacker corps and was nearly as effective as his Florida-bound teammate. Rice's game is his quickness and his long arms that allow him to close on ball carriers in a hurry. Rice, who moves incredibly well, is a sure tackler that seems to be adding strength. He has the length that Joseph lacks but is probably a touch less developed as a linebacker at this juncture. No idea how well you can see this, but I assure you it's Florida commit Vosean Joseph recording a safety. H... https://t.co/Qp6SoqzVHM - Rob Cassidy (@Cassidy_Rob) October 16, 2015 I was surprised by... Montray Smith made few big plays for an sputtering Carol City offense on Friday night. The Chiefs managed just six points in the game, but that one score was in large part thanks to Smith who used his impressive 6-foot-3 frame and solid speed to make a deep catch along the sideline as part of his team's two-minute offense. At this point, the biggest surprise about Smith is his lack of scholarship offers. For the time being, he holds just two. Carol City quarterback Stephen Calvert returned from injury on Friday and played relatively well despite what the scoreboard indicates. It was far from his best game but he showed some impressive elusiveness and flashed his trademark accuracy in spots. Calvert was the victim of a collapsing offensive line at times and was also hurt by a few drops from his receivers. Other notes... For a 2019 prospect Nayquan Wright has no problem with a heavy workload. Wright carried the ball early and often on Saturday and has the quickness and power to develop into a special player. Just a freshman, Wright already holds a handful of major scholarship offers and you can see what that is by watching him carry the ball. Defensive back Val Mayes of Norland says that Louisville remains the leader in his recruitment. The Cardinals, like most other programs, intend to play Mays at safety should they land his commitment. Schools such as N.C. State and FIU are also in pursuit of Mays. Emmett Rice remains committed to Florida State and is fresh off of his official visit to Tallahassee. Still, the four-star linebacker intends to take an official visit to West Virginia on Nov. 6. Syracuse and Missouri may also get official visits from Rice. Vosean Joseph, a Florida pledge, will possibly take visits to Syracuse and West Virginia, both of which remain involved in his recruitment. Joseph plans to take his official visit to Florida on the weekend of the Gators' game with Florida State or the weekend it hosts Georgia . \nRob Cassidy", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:23:44.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
