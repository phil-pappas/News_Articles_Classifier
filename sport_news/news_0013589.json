I thought we had mature players that could get it done and handle it,” Kingsbury said after Tech’s 30-20 win over the Jayhawks. \nThe victory wasn’t assured until safety Jah’Shawn Johnson scored on a 27-yard interception return with 4:07 to play.

Really we all just choked on that side of the ball is the only way to put it — drops and penalties and fumbles, not interested in playing hard. That’s on me as a head coach,” Kingsbury added. \nThe Red Raiders did gain a healthy 584 yards to KU’s 475. However, quarterback Pat Mahomes II was sacked five times on a day he hit 30 of 51 passes for 359 yards with one touchdown and one interception. Entering the game, Tech had allowed just two sacks all season, ranking third in the country in that category. Press Conferences & Post-Game Interviews Postgame: David Beaty proud of Jayhawks after home loss to Texas Tech \nFirst-year Kansas football coach David Beaty explains why he was proud of how the Jayhawks played in a 30-20 home loss to Texas Tech. \n“Offensively we lose Le’Raven (Clark, tackle to injury) and we just fall apart,” Kingsbury said. “Their D-line got after us. Our offensive line played terribly. We were lucky to win the game.” \nKingsbury was hard on himself after the narrow victory. \n“Poor coaching. I did a bad job this week getting them ready to go. The 11 a.m. kickoff ... I thought I had a good plan in place. Obviously didn’t. That’s on me,” he said.

They will be a really good team going forward. I feel some people came out flat and expected Kansas to not be into the game because of the way the season is going right now. It was the complete opposite. They came out here with energy. The crowd was in it and we had to respond.” \nJackson was impressed with the defense wrapping up the victory late. \n“On the defensive side of the ball we said, ‘We’re not going to lose this game. Put it on our shoulders for once to make the push and not have the offense have to carry the load,’” he said. \nKingsbury — he said running back DeAndre Washington (160 yards, 22 carries, one TD) was the only Raider to have a good game offensively — promised the Raiders would correct what hindered them versus KU. Tech travels to Oklahoma on Saturday. \n“Offensively, we took a huge step back but I’ll get that right. We can get the offense going this week and that won’t happen again,” the former Tech quarterback said. \n— See what people were saying about the game during KUsports.com's live blog .
