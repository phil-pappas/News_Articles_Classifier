After suffering an injury in the season opener against Southern Utah on Sept. 3, Hines was forced to miss Utah State’s second game of the season against Utah.\nUpcoming Games USU Football USU football stats & schedule USU @ SDSU Qualcomm Stadium, San Diego Oct. 23, 8:30 p.m. 1 Day 12 Hrs 2 Mins 29 Secs Deshane Hines couldn’t wait to get back on the field. After suffering an injury in the season opener against Southern Utah on Sept. 3, Hines was forced to miss Utah State’s second game of the season against Utah.\nThe 5-foot-10, 185-pound senior cornerback from Fremont, California, doesn’t ever want to go through something like that again.\n“It was really frustrating,” Hines said. “When I went down I was just like, ‘I’ve been waiting so long for this season and preparing.’ I was praying it wouldn’t keep me out for a long time. I realized how much football meant to me and how I need to be on the field. It hurt me when I couldn’t play in the Utah game. I wanted to help the team win and to not be able to contribute was tough.”\nFortunately for Hines and the Aggies , he was back on the field the third week at Washington. The son of Carnedius and Sharon Hines recorded a career-high seven tackles and forced his first career fumble against the Huskies.\n“He’s a young man with a lot of football savvy,” Utah State cornerbacks coach/defensive passing game coordinator Kendrick Shaver said. “He brings leadership to the back end and he is my best technician back there. His football IQ is second to none in my room. I can’t say enough about him. He’s a great young man. He’s no maintenance. You talk about low maintenance, but he’s no maintenance. You don’t have to worry about him being on time for anything and he’s taking care of his schooling. He’s going to graduate in December.”\nBryant Hayes, a close friend and teammate of Hines, is another Aggie who has had to miss playing time during his senior campaign. The 5-9, 175-pound cornerback from Compton, California, was suspended the first two games of the season and did not play against Washington.\n“It hurts,” Bryant said, when asked about not being able to get on the field yet. “When I got the news about being suspended, it hurt. But, that made me realize how much football means to me, rather than other things. I love football and not being on the field with my brothers and teammates hurts. I won’t do anything else to jeopardize my playing time because I let my teammates down. It was a big learning process.”\nHines and Hayes formed a close bond when they were teammates at the College of San Mateo, helping the Bulldogs to a 10-1 record and No. 6 national ranking during their sophomore campaigns in 2013.\nHayes led the College of San Mateo with four interceptions that season, to go along with 17 tackles, while Hines recorded 34 tackles and four pass breakups.\n“You see him on the field and he’s all over the place,” Hines said of Hayes. “He’s quick. He’s like a little rabbit everywhere and covers guys up. I remember at San Mateo, nobody was ever able to catch a ball on him and that has carried over to Utah State. When he comes back, you’re going to feel his presence.”\nShaver agreed.\n“When we recruited B.J., we had in mind a certain type of player to recruit, a young man that could come in and play our nickel spot and a young man that could come in and match up against smaller receivers on the inside,” Shaver said. “We went out with strict marching orders to go find a guy like that. He matched the mold and was playing the nickel spot at his junior college. He had the feet, he had the quickness and the twitch. He’s another young man that has a very high football IQ. He brings that unique specialization to the nickel spot.”\nComing out of the College of San Mateo, Hines was the first to sign with the Aggies. Not long after, Hayes joined his good friend in Logan.", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team100.html"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:30:02.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
