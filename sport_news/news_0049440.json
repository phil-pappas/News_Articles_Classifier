Komen Inland Empire’s annual Race for the Cure will happen Oct. 18 in Lake Elsinore as planned after a religious rights advocacy group withdrew its threat to take the city to court over an alleged conflict of interest.\nAdvocates for Faith and Freedom, which has offices in Murrieta and Santa Ana, demanded in early September that the city rescind its contract allowing Komen to stage its event in Lake Elsinore. The 5K and 10K walks and races, of which The Press-Enterprise is a sponsor, raise money for breast cancer research and breast health programs.\nAdvocacy attorneys contended Councilman Brian Tisdale, who voted in favor of the contract, had an economic conflict because his wife, Sharon Tisdale, is president of Komen Inland Empire’s board of directors.\nPrior to the vote, however, City Attorney Barbara Leibold had advised Brian Tisdale there was no conflict since his wife is an unpaid volunteer. Tisdale made no mention of the relationship when the contract came to the council on Aug. 25.\nThe panel voted 3-2 to host the event at the city’s minor-league baseball stadium and lake levee, with two council members dissenting because they opposed in-kind contributions supporting the activities.\nAdvocacy attorney Marty Nicholson said this week that after receiving a letter from the city defending Tisdale’s position, the firm decided against pursuing further action.\n“I don’t intend to crucify a family that is actively trying to help the community with their leadership, knowledge, skills and abilities,” she said. “That wasn’t my intent, but I do think City Council members from the city of Lake Elsinore need to have better information from the city attorney.”\nTisdale has maintained such a statement was irrelevant because there was no actual conflict.\n“It’s always disappointing when people come after you, and they’re not willing to do a little research to understand the situation,” he said this week.\nThe advocates’ objection to Lake Elsinore’s support for the races stemmed from the national Komen organization’s ties to Planned Parenthood. Komen affiliates in other parts of the country have paid the family planning nonprofit for mammograms and other breast health activities.\nKomen Inland Empire traditionally had staged its event -- which attracts thousands of participants and spectators -- in Temecula at The Promenade mall. This year, however, Temecula’s City Council approved the races on the condition that the organization guarantee none of the funds raised would go toward Planned Parenthood and the revenue would be limited to Riverside and San Bernardino counties.\nInland Empire President Katie Parker, however, said keeping all the money locally would violate a contractual obligation with the national organization. She said this region’s chapter has no relationship with Planned Parenthood.\nBecause of Temecula’s demands, Komen Inland Empire moved the event to Lake Elsinore.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9690 or michaelwilliams@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvwzqu-b88534135z.120151008113534000g31cf897.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://www.komenie.org/race-information/", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvwzqu-b88534135z.120151008113534000g31cf897.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:16:05.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
