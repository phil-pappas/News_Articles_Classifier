Enlarge... \nVassalboro — Despite battling cold, windy, wet conditions, two Midcoast high school golfers — along with a handful of other area student-athletes who qualified and participated — elevated their games to the tune of earning state individual championships on the links Saturday, Oct. 17 at the Natanis Golf Club. \nCamden Hills freshman Cole Anderson finished with the low score in Class A and Oceanside's Nick Mazurek tied for the low score in Class B during the Maine Principals' Association Interscholastic Schoolboy and Schoolboy championships. \nAnderson shot even-par 72 to best a field of 40 golfers in Class A, including runner-up Dylan Burton of Messalonskee (74). Anderson, one of the most talented golfers in his age group in the country, finished with the low round of the 93 boys competitors from all three classes. \nMazurek shot 2-over par 74 to tie with Cape Elizabeth's Ryan Collins (74) in Class B. There were 31 golfers in that class. \nNine Midcoast student-athletes participated in the 18-hole event on Saturday at Natanis. \nThe Class A and B boys played the Tomahawk course and the girls and Class C boys the Arrowhead course. \nBesides Anderson and Mazurek, other area boys state qualifiers were Camden Hills' Julian Starbird (82, tied for 16th in Class A), Belfast's Alex Fritz (84, tied for 16th in Class B), Medomak Valley's Adam Wilcox (88, 24th in Class B) and Mount View's Austin Higgins (85, tied for 20th in Class B) and Ross DeLorenzo (82, tied for 12th in Class B). \nArea girls who qualified were Mount View's Cassidy Gerrish (96, tied for 19th) and Belfast's Madison Hemingway (118, 40th). \nBailey Plourde, whose summer home course is the Samoset Resort Golf Course in Rockport (the same as Anderson), finished first among the 42 girls state competitors with 70, the low round overall among the 135 male and female golfers. She is a sophomore at Lincoln Academy in Newcastle. \nMazurek was co-state champion for the second straight year, this fall in Class B and last season in Class A. In fact, according to Mariner coach Keenan Flanagan, Mazurek may be the first Maine high school golfer to win state individual golf titles in two different classes in back-to-back years. \nIn Class A, Anderson was the champion and Messalonskee's Burton the runner-up. Anderson finished at even-par 72 as he carded nine pars, three bogeys, one double-bogey and five birdies. \nThe Windjammer had his round at 4-under par at one point in the early going. He finished at 3-over par 39 on the front nine holes and 3-under par 33 on the back nine. \nAnderson birdied the 526-yard, par-5 third, 320-yard, par-4 11th, 373-yard, par-4 12th, 163-yard, par-3 13th and 503-yard, par-5 15th. Thus, he birdied three straight holes and four of five on the back side. In fact, he birdied four holes and parred three others to start his round. \nHe finished plus-2 on the par-4s and minus-2 on the par-5s. Anderson doubled-bogeyed his next to final hole, the ninth as he started his round on the 11th hole. \n\"Played really well today,\" Anderson said. \"Got off to a really hot start, birdied four out of my first five holes, which really got me into a good spot. I had been struggling lately with my ball striking but I hit it really well today, which freed up my putting. I struggled a little bit on my back nine and gave back the four birdies I had made, but the wind picked up a lot, so I expected to make a few bogeys. It was also pretty cold, which made it a little more challenging. \n\"It's been an awesome season and this was a great way to finish it off. Coach Mac [Paul MacDonald] has been a great role model for me, as well as [senior] Julian Starbird. Julian really pushed me this year, whether it was in practice or in matches. He's a big reason I had as good of a season as I did, and I'm definitely going to miss him next year. It's a great feeling knowing I have the game to compete with any of the juniors in the state as a freshman. I'm looking forward to the future and seeing what I can do in the years to come.\" \nCoach MacDonald said, \"To make the cut to participate in the individual state Class A final golf match is noteworthy, to say the least, but to win it as a freshman is quite an accomplishment. Since the beginning of the season Cole has had his sites set on participating in the states team competition as well as the individuals. Today he executed a great game plan and played within himself. \n\"Cole started the day with three straight birdies followed by a number pars. His short game was good getting up and down in some clutch situations. His course management was close to flawless. As a freshman Cole certainly plays beyond his years of age 14. He puts the time in to practice. His hard work dedication to the game, coupled with being a very posed golfer, enabled him to be recognized as the state of Maine Class A golfer of the year. Congratulations Cole.\" \nIn Class B, Mazurek and Cape Elizabeth's Ryan Collins were co-champions and Mount Desert Island's Kyle Lamson the runner-up. \nMazurek, who started on the eighth hole, finished plus-2 74, with 10 pars, five bogeys and three birdies. He birdied three of the four par-5s — 490-yard first, 526-yard third and 481-yard 14th. On the flip side, he finished plus-3 on the four par-3s. \nIn Class C, Mattanawcook Academy's Logan Thompson (77) was the champion and Houlton's Ryan Dee (78) the runner-up. \nFor girls, Plourde was the champion and Greely's Erin Holmes the runner-up. Plourde finished at minus-2 70, with a round that included 10 pars, three bogeys and five birdies. She birdied the 385-yard, par-5 first, 361-yard, par-5 fourth, 245-yard, par-4 sixth, 397-yard, par-5 15th and 360-yard, par-4 18th.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:20:47.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
