State officials said this week they didn't immediately know what blew up.\nA soundless 40-second video turned over by US Ecology to state officials showed bursts of white smoke and dirt flying from several explosions on Oct. 18 from the dump in the brown desert about 110 miles northwest of Las Vegas.\nA state fire inspector, Martin Azevedo, surveyed the site on Wednesday.\nHis report, obtained Friday by The Associated Press, described moisture in the pit and \"heavily corroded\" 55-gallon drums in and around the 20-foot-by-30-foot crater. Debris from the blast spread 190 feet. Two drums were found outside the fence line.\nJon Bakkedahl, state radiation control supervisor, said previously the material that exploded was probably buried in the mid-1970s.\nFederal records say 4.7 million cubic feet of materials was buried before the 40-acre waste site closed. Officials say there are 22 trenches up to 100 feet deep and 800 feet long, with pits capped by up to 10 feet of clay and dirt.\nThe permit was for low-level solid radioactive waste, including contaminated tools, protective clothing, machine parts, medical items and laboratory supplies.\nUS Ecology, which was formerly known as Nuclear Engineering Co., said this week the Nevada radiological waste facility operated \"under a different name and different ownership,\" and referred questions about the fire to state officials. Nuclear Engineering Co. changed its name in 1981 to US Ecology.\nThe company today has 15 hazardous materials treatment, storage and disposal facilities around the country - including a 40-acre hazardous materials dump accepting toxic polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, adjacent to the closed Beatty radioactive disposal site.\n\"We offer a service that is required for businesses to comply with complex state and federal regulatory requirements that were established to ensure waste is managed safely and properly,\" company spokesman Dave Crumrine said in email replies to questions.\nNevada state emergency management chief Caleb Cage said operating records for the damaged trench, No. 14, were in Department of Health and Human Services archives and weren't immediately available.\nThe scramble to find the paperwork illustrates problems posed by lax regulation and oversight in the years before and immediately after the federal Environmental Protection Agency was established in 1972. The Beatty dump is not an EPA superfund cleanup site.\n\"Regulations and waste management practices have evolved since the 1960s and 70s,\" a US Ecology statement noted.\nFormer Nevada Gov. Robert List ordered the Beatty low-level waste facility shut down in 1979 and launched a probe after a radioactive cargo fire on a truck parked on U.S. Highway 95 at the facility gate.\nThe fire came three years after employees were dismissed for pilfering radioactive building materials, tools and even a portable cement mixer, according to a 1994 report prepared by the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory.\nOperations at Beatty resumed \"only after assurance was given by the federal government that the rules governing shipments ... would be enforced,\" according to the Idaho lab report.\nList expressed doubt that anyone will ever know what's really underground at the site. \"Good luck with that,\" he said. \"What we found when we did our investigation was they had very, very skimpy records about what was there.\"\nFormer U.S. Sen. Richard Bryan, a Democrat who was governor from 1983 to 1989, remembers \"an ongoing series of problems\" at the Beatty site, including several episodes involving leaking trucks.\nThe radioactive dump covers half an 80-acre property turned over to the state in 1997 and now administered by Health and Human Services. It is an island amid federal land. Nevada leases a surrounding 400-acre buffer from the federal Bureau of Land Management.\nUS Ecology was fined nearly $500,000 by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2010 at its hazardous industrial waste recycling and disposal plant after inspectors found leaky containers and operating logs showing smoke emissions containing hazardous wastes had been improperly vented in 2008. Inspectors also found poor record-keeping.\n\"US Ecology fully cooperated with the EPA, remediated all areas of concern, and the matter was closed,\" Crumrine said. \"We are confident there was no impact to human health or the environment.\"\nCrumrine said the facility was fined one other time since 2005, paying $6,200 after the state found an open container.\nBryan recalled hearings about what was being sent to the site when he was state attorney general and List was governor.\n\"At no time was there any statement made by the company or by any federal official that what was buried at Beatty had a potential to catch fire,\" Bryan remembered.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
