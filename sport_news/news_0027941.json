Back | Next Related Links SLIDESHOW: Pulse of the People: Breast cancer survivors By Jennifer Menster At first, Hope Byrd thought it was a conspiracy.\nWhy were so many women who work at the Chatham County Courthouse getting breast cancer?\nBetween 2008 and 2014, seven co-workers were diagnosed with breast cancer almost to the year of one another.\nByrd has been cancer-free for two years. The “baby” of the group is Vicky Carney, who’s been cancer-free for a year and a half. Deborah Luten-Beasley has been cancer-free for seven years and, along with “mother hen” Mary Ann Boyd, a five-year cancer survivor, often provides the most experienced advice.\nDebbie Byers, who tragically lost her husband in the Imperial Sugar refinery explosion, is a four-year survivor. DeeDe Odom, who lost her husband to lung cancer just a few months before her diagnosis, is a three-year survivor. The outspoken, passionate “leader” of the group, Valerie Murchison, is a five-year survivor.\nAll these women work within a floor of each other at the Chatham County Courthouse on Montgomery Street in downtown Savannah.\nByrd’s doctor told her it was no conspiracy. The American Society Cancer estimates one in eight women will get breast cancer in their lifetime, and that in 2015, 231,840 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be reported.\nConspiracy talk aside, the cancer survivors at the courthouse have formed an ever-lasting support group.\n“I had so much support at work that I don’t know what I would have done without that support,” Byrd said. “The other ladies at work who are breast cancer survivors were such a good support system. They kept me going. When I felt bad, I would go to them and they would pep me up and tell me to keep going.”\nA life-saving push\nIt was a typical busy day at the courthouse for Odom. Busy enough that the Rincon resident was going to skip her scheduled mammogram appointment even though the mobile unit was parked right outside.\nShe told her neighbor across the hall, Murchison, that she decided not to go to her appointment. Murchison, who was diagnosed with breast cancer five years ago, wasn’t going to let her friend miss that appointment.\n“I pushed (DeeDe) to go get that mammogram,” Murchison said. “I told her you better go or I am not speaking to you anymore.”\nIt was a potentially life-saving push.\nThe day following her mammogram, Odom got a call that she would need to come in for more testing. She later learned she had breast cancer.\nIt was an especially scary realization for Odom. Just four months earlier, her husband died of lung cancer.\n“(I thought) ‘Why me?’ because I had just lost my husband to cancer four months before that,” Odom said. “He’s gone and now I have to fight this battle. I have two kids. I didn’t want them to have to help me fight this battle after just losing their daddy.”\nOdom was surrounded by support of her family, friends and co-workers, especially Murchison. They all reminded her she was strong and could handle her battle.\nJust like she was there for Odom, Murchison had support from fellow co-workers. She turned to Luten-Beasley and Boyd.\nMurchison started experiencing stabbing pains in her chest in mid-2010. It never entered her mind it could be a tumor. She had a mammogram in March that came back negative.\n“I have a history of fibromyalgia so when my chest started hurting, I thought it was fibromyalgia,” Murchison said. “Well, we went on vacation to Universal Studios. I was working like normal. Finally, I went to the doctor.\n“It was a hard pill to swallow,” Murchison said. “They had to explain to me why I had had a mammogram in March, and six months later I had cancer progressing so fast.”\nLuten-Beasley was the first person, besides her husband, Murchison told. She was a rock for Murchison on questions about diagnosis, surgery and insurance. Boyd was her tough love coach.\nMurchison remembers crying in her office one day, worried the cancer was going to return. Boyd walked in, closed the door behind her and told Murchison to suck it up.\n“Every time I had a pain or ache, I thought the cancer was coming back,” Murchison said. “Mary Ann would tell me to ‘suck up the tears; there’s nothing wrong; it can’t come back that fast.’ Mary Ann did not bite her tongue. That was great.\n“When each of us got cancer, we never knew that we would be able to help each other out,” Murchison said. “God knew. I needed Deb and Mary Ann. When I was diagnosed, they helped me. I was here when DeeDe needed me. We pull off each other — and God.\n“To me, I was never a cancer patient. I was a person with cancer.”\n‘Deal with it and go on’\nThe seven survivors at the courthouse share different stories of diagnosis, surgery and emotions. Some cried a lot. Some cried only alone. Few shed very little tears.\nFor Carney, 41, of Port Wentworth, cancer was an inconvenience, but it didn’t slow her from her normal routine.\n“I never halted what I was doing,” Carney said. “I was running until the fourth treatment and my legs were so swollen I couldn’t run.\n“To me, I was never a cancer patient. I was a person with cancer.”\nCarney learned she had cancer when her puppy jumped on her chest and caused an unusual, lingering pain. She ignored it for a while, but when the pain was there three months later, she couldn’t ignore it any longer.\nWhen the doctor called a few days following her mammogram, Carney knew it wasn’t good news. She also knew right then cancer wasn’t going to slow her from living life.\n“I looked at cancer like a part of life,” she said. “You deal with it and go on.”\nCarney didn’t want a lot of people to know she had cancer and didn’t want help or sympathy from others. She was living on her own at the time, doing the dishes, laundry and cooking meals.\nWhile she chose to do a lot of tasks on her own during her battle, Carney acknowledges the importance of support and how helpful it is to most breast cancer survivors.\n“There were always people I could call, but I didn’t want people to clean my dirty laundry,” Carney says. “I had one friend who would bring me food. I remember waking up with a bacon sandwich on my shoulder. I ate that bacon like someone was fixing to steal it.”\nLike Carney, Byrd didn’t want people to know she had cancer because she didn’t want special treatment or sympathy.\nByrd, 50, of Savannah, learned she had breast cancer two years ago. It was the subtle and not-so-subtle influence of two co-workers that led Byrd to get a lump she had discovered checked out.\nShe told one co-worker about the lump. Byrd kept making up reasons for not going to the doctor. This co-worker, who lost a sister to breast cancer, told her to stop making excuses and get the lump checked. Byrd said she is glad she went when she did.\nThe other influential co-worker was Murchison.\n“I remember a couple of days before I found out, Valerie had walked by me dressed in all pink,” Byrd said. “I thought she looked so beautiful. A few days later, I got the call to come in (to the doctor’s office). I told the doctor to go ahead and tell me. I knew it couldn’t be good with the doctor calling me.”\nByrd said the doctor told her over the phone. At the time, she was a smoker. Byrd immediately grabbed her pack of cigarettes and threw them away.\nThat was almost two years ago. She goes for reconstruction surgery on Nov. 6.\nGet yourself checked\nWhile these seven co-workers at the Chatham County courthouse share different stories about the discovery of their cancer and their battles with cancer, one thing is certain: Support is crucial.\nWhether it was a push to get a mammogram, a pink flag hanging on their door at work or a tough love message, these ladies found strength through each other.\nThey continue to support each other, and Murchison thinks of the group as spokeswomen for the county. They have participated for two years in the “Ladies in Pink Fashion Show” hosted by Dillard’s to benefit the Susan G. Komen Foundation and encourage everyone to go get a mammogram.\n“Cancer is no joke, especially breast cancer because it can spread,” Murchison said. “It is so common in women now. Cancer doesn’t care if you are black, white, short. Cancer is the big C.”\nTo schedule your mammogram at one of five locations in Chatham and Beaufort counties, call 912-819-PINK.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14821801.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14821802.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14822076.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14821800.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14821800.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14821802.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14821801.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14822076.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:10:47.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
