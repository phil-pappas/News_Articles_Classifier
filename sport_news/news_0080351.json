We'll beat around the bush, skirt around an answer and stall until the question goes away - but we hate saying \"I don't know.\" \nBut... \nWhen it comes to choosing the top college football team in the Top 25, I don't think anyone really knows that team's identity yet. \nThat, of course, is where \"opinion\" takes over - but I don't even have a strong opinion about any of the top 10 teams, at least not yet. \nOften, when most teams are six games into the season, a clear-cut favorite has emerged. This year? Not so much. AP Top 25 College Football Poll \nI've continued to place Ohio State at No. 1, in large part because no team has clearly identified itself to me as the Buckeyes' replacement at the top. As long as OSU keeps winning - and no other team convinces me they should be ranked No. 1 I'll probably keep scribbling the Buckeyes in at the top spot. \nNote to the rest of the college football world: We're accepting applications for No. 1... \nBaylor and TCU have been steamrolling opponents, but has either team recorded a signature win? Utah may have the best resume in the top 25, but are the Utes really the best team in the land? I'm not sold, and neither are most voters. \nHey, Clemson and Texas A&M each received a first-place vote this week. They're both undefeated with a couple of quality wins each, so why not? \nThe coming weekend brings a number of compelling matchups - No. 10 Alabama at No. 9 Texas A&M, No. 8 Florida at No. 6 LSU and No. 7 Michigan State at No. 12 Michigan to name three. No. 2 Baylor hosts previously-ranked West Virginia, and No. 1 Ohio State hosts Penn State - so both teams at the top have opportunities for quality wins. But we may have 2-3 more teams with legitimate claims for the top spot (if A&M & Michigan State both win, plus the Florida-LSU winner - that would be three undefeated teams coming off marquee wins), so things might not be any more clear by next week at this time. \nAs for local teams, I have Duke in at No. 22 and Carolina's schedule will give them a chance to crack the poll in the next week or so (assuming they keep winning, of course). \nHere's my top 25 ballot, with the actual AP rankings in parentheses. The only real disconnect between my ballot and the overall is that I voted 5-0 Temple in at No. 25 (they do have a win over Penn State), while the full AP Poll has Cal at No. 23. \n1 Ohio State (1)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:32:06.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
