PAUL, Minn. – When your team has a problem scoring goals, you turn to … your goaltender?\nFrederik Andersen is pretty skilled at handling the puck for a goalie and always looks for opportunities to spring a forward with a long outlet pass, but it isn’t likely that he is going to help the Ducks in their desperate search for offense.\nWhat he’s about is stopping pucks from going in, and Andersen is expected to return to the net Saturday against the Minnesota Wild. And the Ducks are among a few teams that need a spark to start fulfilling some high expectations.\nThe Ducks fell to 1-4-1 with their loss Thursday in Nashville and their one goal against the Predators marked the fifth time in their six games that they’ve scored one or none. And Anton Khudobin could not deliver another quality start in their net.\nAndersen has had a week off since his last appearance. The goalie that proved he could handle the No. 1 job last season insisted there was no injury issue holding him back from playing. He has waited patiently while Ducks coach Bruce Boudreau tried to get Khudobin untracked.\nNow with a team that’s underachieving, Andersen looks to reclaim what was his and give the Ducks a lift.\n“Every time you go into the net, you’ve got to give them a chance to win,” Andersen said. “That’s the bottom line as a goalie. That’s your only job. Try and stop the pucks so you can give them a chance to win. Keep giving them a chance to get the first goal or keep it 1-0 or whatever the score may be.\n“Keep it close enough that you can be in reach.”\nIt is what Andersen has done in his three starts. He’s allowed only five goals on 93 shots in them and – adding a 20-save outing in relief of Khudobin on Oct. 14 – has a sparkling 1.57 goals-against average and .947 save percentage.\nThe problem is, in the three losses he has taken, Andersen has received a grand total of one regulation goal from his teammates. The six goals for the Ducks in six games is their least ever over a similar stretch to open a season.\nMaybe the spark that is needed is Andersen stealing a win with some stellar goaltending and getting a goal scratched out for him if it has to come to that. But that isn’t his mindset when he takes the ice.\n“You never go in like that,” Andersen said. “You just got to go in and make one save at a time. If you look at it after the game as if I’ve stolen one, it’s good. Whatever. Bottom line is you got to go in and do your job. That’s what I’m here for. That’s the bottom line.”\nFollowing the 5-1 loss to Nashville, Boudreau said “in all likelihood” he would turn back to Andersen on Saturday after giving Khudobin a second straight start as a reward for his 34-save effort in the Ducks’ only win, 4-1, against the Wild at Honda Center.\nAndersen was diplomatic, saying it isn’t his job to decide who plays when and added, “I’m not going to start being a child about anything.”\n“It’s always the coach’s (decision),” Andersen said. “I respect his opinion and his reasons for who he might play. I only look at this way, that whenever I get back in there, I want to make sure I don’t give him a reason to take me out again.”\nLINES JUMBLED AGAIN \nLooking for a way to jump-start his ailing attack, Boudreau took his four lines and did a juggling act Friday.\nRyan Getzlaf and Corey Perry were split, with Getzlaf centering Mike Santorelli and Chris Stewart. Perry was on the second line with center Rickard Rakell moved up and Patrick Maroon on the left side.\nMeanwhile, Ryan Kesler and Jakob Silfverberg stayed together as a pair but were wearing orange jerseys that usually identify the third line. The two had a new linemate in Jiri Sekac, who got his first goal Thursday.\nIt seemed drastic but Boudreau has always taken the proactive approach instead of keeping slumping lines together and hope they generate some chemistry. He’d rather try to find combinations that work.\n“Right now when you’re struggling to score goals, it’s a hard thing to do,” Boudreau said. “I told the players today that I hate moving the lines as much as I’m moving them right now. It just kills me. But until we find something that works and clicks, we’re going to have to do it.”\nThe four players who are expected to do the bulk of the goal scoring – Getzlaf, Perry, Kesler and Silfverberg – have yet to put the puck in the net. A day after Getzlaf and Perry said it was time they led the Ducks out of their funk, Kesler joined right in.\n“It starts with me, Silfvy, Getzy, Pears,” Kesler said. “It starts with those guys. We have to turn the ship around. It’s a team game but we have to lead them in the right direction. So it’s on us.”\nDAY OFF \nLeft wing Carl Hagelin and defenseman Josh Manson did not practice Friday, with both getting the day off for maintenance. Both are expected to be available against Minnesota.\nContact the writer: estephens@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T14:40:33.898+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
