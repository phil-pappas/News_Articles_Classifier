(Photo: David Zalubowski, Associated Press) \nWith their last-place finish in the American League Central Division, the Tigers aren’t going to have anyone in any postseason rankings.\nBut, they do have a few former teammates.\nIf it wasn’t injuries or their bullpen issues, the Tigers’ decision to trade off a few big pieces to beef up their thin farm system all but sealed their fate as outsiders as baseball begins its postseason Tuesday night.\nAnd all but gave a few teams the boost they needed for the playoffs.\nTwo of those pieces — outfielder Yoenis Cespedes and left-hander David Price — ranked Nos. 5 and 6, respectively, in the Sporting News’ list of top 50 players in the postseason , which came out Tuesday.\nCespedes was sent to the New York Mets in a deal that netted the Tigers pitchers Luis Cessa and Michael Fulmer, who dominated after arriving in the Tigers system in the July 31 trade.\nCespedes did the same in New York, where he bashed 17 home runs with 44 RBIs — comparable to his Tigers totals (18-61), despite 173 fewer at-bats.\n“Perhaps the greatest trade deadline acquisition of all time returns to the postseason,” Jesse Spector of the Sporting News wrote, “where he looks to build on his .920 OPS.”\nPrice, who was sent to Toronto for pitching prospects Daniel Norris, Matt Boyd and Jairo Loubert, drew similar — no, make that identical, — praise from Spector, who also called Price, “perhaps the greatest trade deadline acquisition of all time.”\nPrice went 9-1 with a 2.30 ERA and 1.01 WHIP with the Blue Jays after the trade, striking out 87 in 741/3 innings.\nOther former Tigers on the list include Mets outfielder Curtis Granderson (No. 29), Yankees reliever Andrew Miller (34), and Rangers first baseman Prince Fielder (49).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T00:18:17.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
