Vick left in the third quarter with a hamstring injury and Pittsburgh's offense took off when Jones took over. Jones hit Bryant for an 8-yard score to give the Steelers the lead. The two hooked up later for an 88-yard strike as the Steelers (4-2) won their second straight. Jones completed 8 of 12 passes for 168 yards and the two scores. Bryant caught six passes for 137 yards in his first action of the season. Le'Veon Bell ran for 88 yards and rookie Chris Boswell kicked three long field goals for the Steelers. Carson Palmer threw for 421 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions. John Brown caught 10 balls for 196 yards but the Cardinals collapsed in the second half. \n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
