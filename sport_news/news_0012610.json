Quarterback Eli Manning hit wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. for a 13-yard touchdown pass, and it was 7-0. \nThe Eagles then went three-and-out on their opening possession, with quarterback Sam Bradford overthrowing a pair of open receivers. The Giants got right back to work, taking over at their own 37 and marching down to the Philadelphia 23. \nBut then, the game changed. \nManning threw to tight end Larry Donnell, who had the ball ripped from his arms for an interception by Eagles linebacker DeMeco Ryans. \nAnd the Eagles wrestled away the momentum and, eventually, the game. \nFrom there, the Eagles -- despite playing sloppy football -- scored the next 27 points, rolling to a potentially season-changing win that has the Eagles, and no longer the Giants, sitting in first place atop the NFC East. PLUS : Giants TE Daniel Fells doing well in recovery from MRSA \nThe Giants blew a spectacular opportunity. They could have all but knocked the Eagles out of the divisional race with a win. Instead, they are now looking up at the Eagles, and facing a crucial game Sunday against the Dallas Cowboys at MetLife Stadium. \nAnd, it is not like they lost to a star quarterback. Quite the opposite, in fact. Manning had a rough night, getting sacked four times and throwing a pick-six. \nBut Eagles quarterback Sam Bradford was downright horrific. Despite having a wealth of time to throw, thanks to the Giants' mostly punchless pass rush, Bradford overthrew receivers, underthrew receivers and was picked off three times. Bradford finished 24-for-38 for 280 yards and a TD to go with the three picks -- for a passer rating of 61.3. \nThe Giants could not do anything with the handful of openings they received. They committed three turnovers (running back Rashad Jennings fumbled away a reception) and punted eight times. \nTheir three-game winning streak is now kaput. They are once again in second place in the division. They still can't get after the passer. They committed too many self-inflicted dumb penalties to list. \nAnd yet, they were about to run away with it early. \nTurning point : The Ryan interception was pretty big, but you can also point to Eagles cornerback Nolan Carroll's 17-yard interception return for a touchdown to make it 14-7 in the first half as a big moment. That gave the Eagles a lead they would not relinquish. \nThe game was over when : Eagles running back DeMarco Murray bounced around the right corner for a 12-yard touchdown run to give the Birds a 17-point lead with 6:13 left in the third quarter. You could talk yourself into the abysmal Giants offense scoring 10 points, but 17 to get back into the game was clearly a bridge too far. \nFirst half recap : Operating out of a two-tight end formation and going no huddle, the Giants marched right down the field to start the game, moving 80 yards on eight plays capped by Manning's 13-yard touchdown pass to Beckham, giving the Giants a 7-0 lead four-and-a-half minutes into the game. \nThe Giants then looked in position to make it 14-0 after the Eagles went three-and-out. But Manning's pass to tight end Larry Donnell was ripped out of Donnell's arms by Eagles linebacker DeMeco Ryans for an interception. \nThe Eagles then put together a scoring drive, aided by Giants defensive end Damontre Moore getting an inexcusable roughing the passer penalty on what would have been a failed third down attempt. \nAfter catching a break with the penalty, Eagles quarterback Sam Bradford made the Giants pay, hitting wideout Riley Cooper for a 32-yard touchdown strike to tie the game at 7 with 3:33 remaining in the first quarter. \nThe Eagles then grabbed a 14-7 lead when Eagles cornerback Nolan Carroll jumped a route and picked it off before returning it 17 yards for a touchdown. \nThat was the start of a parade of ineptitude by both clubs, putting together 12 minutes and 26 seconds of woeful football to close out the half. \nAfter the interception, the following transpired: \n• The Giants lost a fumble when running back Rashad Jennings coughed up a pass reception that was recovered \n• Bradford overthrew a wide-open receiver by a country mile and was intercepted by Giants cornerback Jayron Hosley. \n• The two teams traded punts for five consecutive series, with the Giants punting three times, the Eagles twice. \n• Eagles kicker Caleb Sturgis connected on a 37-yard field goal with three seconds left in the half, giving Philadelphia a 17-7 lead at the break. But the kick came after Giants defensive tackle Cullen Jenkins got hit for roughing the passer, and Bradford took a sack on first-and-goal after holding on to the ball too long. \nInjuries and inactives : Linebacker Jonathan Casillas left the game with a neck injury and did not return. He was hampered by a neck injury during the preseason. Safety Brandon Meriweather left the game in the first half with a knee sprain, but returned after halftime. Defensive tackle Johnathan Hankins suffered a leg injury, but returned as well. Prior to the game, defensive end Robert Ayers Jr. was inactive for the fourth straight game. He did make the trip to Philly, however, which could be a sign he is getting close to a return.

Kickoff is set for 4:25 p.m. The Giants lost to the Cowboys, 27-26, in the season-opener in Arlington, Texas, when, well, you know what happened . \nJames Kratch can be reached at jkratch@njadvancemedia.com or by leaving a note in the comments below.
