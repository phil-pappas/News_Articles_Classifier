(AP) - Five Louisiana parishes, led by St. Tammany, are among the 20 counties with the highest Medicare per capita spending in the country. That's according to a report from the Kaiser Family Foundation.\nSt. Tammany ranked No. 10 at $11,146 in 2013, the latest data available.\nThe figures were adjusted to account for differences in Medicare prices and beneficiaries' health risk.\nThe 20 highest-spending counties and parishes have significantly more post-acute care providers - skilled nursing facilities and home health care services - per capita and significantly fewer physicians than the 20 lowest-spending counties.\nTangipahoa was No. 12 at $11,066; followed by Rapides, No. 14 at $10,938; Bossier, No. 16 at $10,918; and Ouachita, No. 19, at $10.891.\nThe Advocate reports ( http://bit.ly/1G2Q8xL ) the U.S. average was $9,343.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
