The Employees' Provident Fund Commissioner has sanctioned me pension. I have received Rs 2,50,000 as commuted pension and the rest of pension is paid to me in monthly instalments. I had also contributed to a pension scheme of the Central Government. I shall be receiving monthly payments under the said scheme. Is the commuted pension received from the PF commissioner taxable? Is the contributory pension received under the government scheme taxable? — Krishan Kumar Your queries are replied hereunder: (a) Any payment in computation of pension received under any scheme of any employer other than that of the Central Government or the state government is exempt from tax. (i) In a case where the employee receives any gratuity, the computed value of one-third of the pension which he is normally entitled to receive, and (ii) In any other case, the computed value of one-half of such pension. (b) The amount of pension received under the Central Government contributory scheme is taxable. I get reimbursement of domiciliary medical expenses from my company incurred by me and my wife on production of doctor's prescriptions, consultation fee and cash memos from chemists. As and when I or my wife are hospitalised, the company reimburses me the medical expenses. Are these reimbursements taxable?— Rajiv The reimbursement of medical expenses to an employee by the employer to the extent of Rs 15,000 in a year is exempt from tax. In respect of expenditure on hospitalisation, the amount paid by the employer in respect of an expenditure incurred by an employee would be exempt from tax, if the medical treatment is in a hospital maintained or approved by the government. In case the treatment is in respect of prescribed diseases or ailments, the expenditure incurred would be exempt, if the same has been incurred in any hospital approved by the Chief Commissioner having regard to the prescribed guidelines. My father-in-law has gifted Rs 3 lakh to my daughter (minor) out of his retirement benefits for investment in Kisan Vikas Patras (KVPs) in her name. KVPs were taken from the post offices. I am her guardian till she becomes a major. The maturity period is more than eight years when the amount becomes double i.e Rs 6 lakh. I am a housewife and have no income from other sources. Can I distribute the interest accrued during each financial year in the income-tax return till its maturity? If the interest income is much below the exempt limit for women during the relevant financial year, is it essential to file a return? — Brij Gupta The accrued amount of interest on Kisan Vikas Patras gifted by your father-in-law to his granddaughter (i.e. your daughter) has to be included in your income in accordance with the provisions of the Act. If your total income, including the accrued interest on Kisan Vikas Patras so gifted to your daughter, is below the taxable limit applicable to you, you need not file the income-tax return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:10:53.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
