(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer) College football » Utes, Cougars and Aggies are a combined are 15-4, leading to bigger second-half goals for all three programs Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (10) My annual midseason review of college football in Utah embraces the reasoned outlook of BYU receiver Devon Blackman, who recently made sure to clarify that the trials he has faced in adapting to Provo's culture are in a different category than those endured by Jesus Christ or rapper Tupac Shakur. Devon's right. Proper perspective is important in any discussion. That's especially true during a season when there's some danger of getting ahead of ourselves, with Utah contending for a College Football Playoff berth and Utah State in the conversation for a New Year's 6 bowl bid. Much football remains to be played. VIDEOS Check out all the Trib TopJobs Yet considering that Utah, BYU and USU have combined for the best first-half record (15-4) in the state's modern college football history, Utahns all should be enjoying what's happening around here — disregarding a fan's instincts to devalue the rival programs and resent their success, of course. What's clear is that more crazy stuff is bound to occur, in a season when Michigan punter Blake O'Neill, formerly of Weber State, produced an ending that will be remembered for the wrong reasons by fumbling and enabling Michigan State to score the winning touchdown on the final play Saturday. Already, BYU's Tanner Mangum has delivered five fourth-quarter victories, Utah has beaten Oregon by 42 points and, in a 32-minute stretch covering two games in Utah, Boise State has lost nine turnovers and been outscored 59-10. Utah Thnk about this: Travis Wilson entered the season needing 12 victories to become Utah's all-time winningest quarterback. USU's Chuckie Keeton needed four wins for a similar distinction. And now Wilson has a much better shot than Keeton at his school record. Wilson missed one game, so he's 5-0 this season, making him 20-12 for his career. He's within range of Brian Johnson's 26 wins with six regular-season games left, plus a potential Pac-12 championship game and whatever follows for Utah. That's wild stuff, for a guy who was benched twice last season. What's next? The Rose Bowl, becoming a consolation prize? In their fifth Pac-12 season, two years removed from winning exactly two conference games, the Utes are ranked No. 3 in the AP Top 25. Utah made nice progress last year, but nobody could have seen this coming. Is Utah the third-best team in the country? No. Are the Utes' accomplishments worthy of their ranking? Yes. That's not a contradiction. And if they keep winning, the Utes will deserve an opportunity to answer that first question differently. Utah is a complete team, maybe more so than anybody else. These Utes are resourceful, making critical plays in the style of the 2008 team, and their talent level is increasing — although that '08 roster was loaded with more NFL prospects, until proven otherwise. The Utes have grown offensively, as they proved Saturday against Arizona State. The Sun Devils held Devontae Booker to 17 yards on his first 13 carries, but Wilson responded by passing for 297 yards and Booker eventually broke through with two long touchdown runs. Utah and Stanford clearly are the Pac-12's best teams, pointing toward a championship game at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. The question is whether the winner would get a College Football Playoff semifinal bid to the Cotton or Orange Bowls, with one Power 5 champ being snubbed. It would be difficult to imagine an unbeaten Utah team being left out of the committee's top four, regardless of what happens elsewhere. If the Utes (or Stanford) have a loss or two, other variables would come into play. Regardless, one of those teams — maybe the title-game loser — will play in the Rose Bowl. BYU September started wonderfully and ended badly for the Cougars, while October has been more fun than anyone expected in Provo. And now Wagner is coming to town Saturday. The Seawolves (0-6) may be the worst team that has ever visited Utah in any sport, with competition from St. Katherine College's basketball team, which lost 107-36 to Weber State and 124-51 to Utah in 2013-14. After two byes, in essence, the Cougars will resume what has turned out to be an entertaining schedule. Two defining games remain: Nov. 14 vs. Missouri in Kansas City and Nov. 28 at Utah State. If BYU finished 10-2, that would be a satisfying season, going into the Las Vegas Bowl against a Pac-12 team. Other than the offense's dreadful day at Michigan, Mangum has proven to be a nice discovery in replacing the injured Taysom Hill. In all five of BYU's wins, Mangum has come through in the fourth quarter, with his team behind or tied. So the annual discussion has gone from wondering where the Cougars would be with Hill to where they would be without Mangum. As a 22-year-old freshman, Mangum can enter the NFL draft after any season, so his future is interesting. Same with Hill, who has a choice to make with another year of eligibility. I don't picture Hill staying at BYU, out of consideration to Mangum. Personally, I'd like to see him play at Michigan, but taking an NFL opportunity seems more likely for him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:31:39.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
