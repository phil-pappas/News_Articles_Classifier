O.B. Cole first opened the pharmacy’s doors on Aug. 13, 1877, on Evergreen Street in Kingston Center. The next owner, Henry Breach, ran the business as Breach and Loring until Frank Jordan purchased the pharmacy around 1913. Jordan’s Pharmacy had been moved to 65 Summer St. when Leon P. Tura bought the business in 1937. In 1961 he opened for business in a brand new building, Tura's current location at 85 Summer St. At the close of business Tuesday (Oct. 13), Paul Tura and his brother, Tom, put their key into the door for the final time. Wednesday their inventory and files would be transferred to Stop & Shop in Kingston. Stop & Shop sought them out and presented a reasonable offer, Paul Tura said. He and Tom will work at Stop & Shop and are comfortable with the arrangement. Two of their technicians will also be joining the Stop & Shop Pharmacy staff. “We’ve had an excellent relationship over the years with Stop & Shop,” he said. “You might be in competition, but you help each other out. After all in this business we’re all about serving the public’s needs.” He said Stop & Shop was interested in their innovate customized prescription blister card programs. In 1981, Tura’s was the first retail pharmacy in the South Shore area to have its own in-house pharmacy computer system, with modules for both retail and nursing home pharmacy services. A 13.9 megabyte hard drive initially ran all the retail and nursing home scripts. Through the years the Tura family has enjoyed serving its loyal customers. “It’s been a wonderful experience,” Paul said. “We’ve had really great customers.” The Turas have even maintained their own museum in the back of the store with mementos from the pharmacy’s past. It includes a complete set of prescription bottles inscribed with \"Henry Breach, pharmacist, Kingston, Mass.\" Breach’s great-great-grandson, who spent part of his summers in Plymouth with his grandmother and is now retired and living in Hawaii, looked the Turas up a few years ago and even found his great-great-grandfather’s grave in Evergreen Cemetery. The oldest memento in the collection is a book that dates back to O.B. Cole when he started it all 138 years ago.
