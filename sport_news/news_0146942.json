That led to progress for the passing game in the 9-7 victory, even though the running game put forth its worst performance to date. “We have got to separate from man-to-man better,” coach David Cutcliffe said. “We have got to throw it more consistently, but (quarterback) Thomas (Sirk) is playing under tough circumstances time and time again. We’re going to figure out the personality of this offense, and that’s part of it.” The Blue Devils averaged 10.8 yards per completion. Sirk completed half his passes for 195 yards without an interception. The downfield throws were much more prevalent in the first half. Of Sirk’s 18 first-half attempts, six went for more than 10 yards, including four of 18 or more. Sirk threw 18 passes in the second half as well, but only three went for more than 10, the longest of which was a 13-yard gain. “I was happy to see our receivers and tight ends compete down the field,” Sirk said. But Duke ran for just 33 yards on 35 attempts against the Eagles’ top-ranked defense. Sirk ran for just 5 yards Saturday, the first time this year he hasn’t eclipsed the 50-yard mark. Shaquille Powell led the Blue Devils’ rushers with 18 yards on 14 carries. Jela Duncan and Shaun Wilson each carried the ball four times, gaining a total of 21 yards. Cutcliffe said center Matt Skura told him after the game that Boston College’s defensive line was the best he has ever played against. “We didn’t want to very often pack the line of scrimmage — we wanted to spread the field,” coach David Cutcliffe said. “We felt we were really close. If we would’ve been a little more successful throwing the ball, and looking back, we could’ve run a few more screens to give them more chances, then that would’ve been a lot of our run game. “We had 33 yards rushing, part of that is the sacks, which I don’t like. But give a great Boston College defense their due.” The Blue Devils converted 4 of 17 third downs (23.5 percent), but that’s nothing new against the Eagles. Boston College has held all of its opponents to four or fewer third-down conversions. “We just have to come out and be consistent,” Sirk said. “It’s going to take consistency the rest of the year. That’s something we have to continue to get better at.” By Tommy Hamzik", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T08:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T12:18:17.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
