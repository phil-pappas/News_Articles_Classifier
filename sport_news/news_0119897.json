(Photo: PTI) New Delhi: Responsible for shaping up Vijender Singh ahead of his eagerly-awaited professional debut, globally renowned trainer Lee Beard is mighty impressed by the star Indian boxer's technical know-how and the sheer power he puts into his punches.\nBeard, who has formerly trained pro stars like Ricky Hatton and Floyd Mayweather Sr, has been grooming Vijender for more than a month in Manchester.\nVijender will be making his pro debut come Saturday against Britain's Sonny Whiting.\n\"In my analysis, Vijender is technically a very talented boxer. You rarely see a natural talent like him.\nCan't wait to start new life with pro debut: Vijender Singh\nThat's something which is very impressive about him,\" Beard said in an interview from Manchester.\n\"He is a very experienced guy at the amateur level. He knows his punches and he punches very hard. All in all, I rate him as a brilliant boxer and I have very high hopes from him,\" he said.\nBut Vijender is not without faults either and his jabs is something that Beard worked on during their training stint, which has been on for more than a month.\n\"Every player has his own strengths and weaknesses and it's not that I am trying to teach him anything. But I have tried to make sure that his jabbing is better. That was one area which needed to be worked on.\nI had another opportunity and that's why I have turned a pro: Vijender Singh\n\"Besides, I have also tried to make sure that his body attacks are more precise and effective. These are some of the areas that we have together worked on in the last one month or so,\" Beard said.\n\"He is a hard-working guy. Although he is making his pro debut at 29, I would say he is in a very good space. He has been getting used to the new routine, new technique, new environment quite smoothly,\" he added.\n Vijender Singh Boxing sports Sonny Whiting AIBA Boxing India Also Read Abhijeet Gupta shares UAE chess lead ICC World T20: India beat England by 20 runs in second warm-up game My son is a fighter, will not quit, says Yuvraj Singh's mother Sreesanth is still waiting to meet board", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Boxa.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151008/sports-other-sports/article/vijender-singh-impresses-british-trainer-lee-beard", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Boxa.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-12T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:26:51.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
