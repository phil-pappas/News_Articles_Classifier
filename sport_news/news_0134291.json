Doctson caught a 32-yard pass in the first quarter from quarterback Trevone Boykin for the first of his two touchdowns on the evening.\nThe second scoring reception carried far more weight. With the score knotted up at 45-45, Boykin ran for a nine-yard gain to the TCU 45. On the following play Doctson hauled in a 55-yard TD snag to push the lead to 52-45 with just over a minute on the clock. Kansas State lost a fumble on the following possession to seal the deal for TCU.\nIn total, the senior receiver caught eight passes on the evening for 155 yards and two touchdowns.\nHonorable mention: QB Patrick Mahomes, Texas Tech (33 of 46 passing, 428 yards, 5 TDs in 66-31 win over Iowa State); QB Seth Russell, Baylor (18 of 27 passing, 246 yards, 3 TDs; 5 carries, 6 yards, TD; did not play in second half in 66-7 win over Kansas); QB J.W. Walsh, Oklahoma State (2 of 3 passing, 10 yards, TD; 4 carries, 17 yards, Game-winning overtime TD in 33-26 win over West Virginia)\nFollow Brandon Wheeland on Twitter: @BrandonWheeland\nOn Twitter:\n @BrandonWheeland", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/brandonwheeland", "https://twitter.com/BrandonWheeland"], "published": "2015-10-12T06:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:44:38.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
