Comments \nATHENS, Ga. â€• Mark Richt made his final comments of Alabama week after Wednesday's practice in Athens. We'll touch on some of the highlights as the Bulldogs prepare for the 2:30 p.m. CT Saturday game in Sanford Stadium. \n-- One of the mysteries from Alabama's game plan surrounds Bo Scarbrough. The freshman running back was suspended the first four games but is eligible for Georgia. Nick Saban on Monday said they would \"try to create a role for him.\" Richt was asked about that dynamic Wednesday. \n\"Bo's a very talented guy,\" Richt said. \"We certainly watched his high school tape and were very interested in him but it turned out he chose Alabama. I don't know if they have plans for him or not quite frankly but before his career is over, I think he'll prove to be a really great back.\" \nRELATED: Nick Saban's Wednesday comments on Georgia \n-- Bulldogs QB Greyson Lambert has had good focus this week, always taking good notes in meetings. \"Certainly not perfect but you can tell he's locked in and you appreciate that.\" \n-- It's a big weekend for recruiting, but Richt said the winner doesn't necessarily get the recruit just because of the scoreboard. Recruits see where he would fit watching the game. And \"somewhere in his gut, he's going to be cheering for one team over the other.\" If they're unsure, it comes down to how they fit into a given team's framework. \n-- Richt said he's getting a lot more ticket requests this week, but that's up to his wife and assistant. \n-- The weather is uncertain for Saturday but Richt said that doesn't factor into the practice/preparation. Georgia doesn't have an indoor complex and it practiced in the rain Tuesday and Richt can see some benefit. But unless the wind is out of control, they won't change a game plan. \n-- Richt said defensive back Rico McGraw is probable for Saturday with a knee injury. \n-- Middle linebacker Reggie Carter is expected to miss the game with a shoulder injury. \n-- Nick Chubb is going for a record 13 straight 100-yard games but Richt said they aren't worried at all about getting it. They'd love for him to tie Herschel Walker's mark but they can't let that enter the thought process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:24:54.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
