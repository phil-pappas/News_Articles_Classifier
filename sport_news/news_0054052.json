Myers' second chance also went wide right. Then in overtime, his 48-yard attempt went wide left. \nHasselbeck took advantage of the field position to drive for the winning score. \nVinatieri became the first NFL player to reach 1,000 points with two different teams. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
