New Mariners general manager Jerry Dipoto made the announcement.\nServais worked the past five seasons as an assistant general manager for the Los Angeles Angels and worked alongside Dipoto for most of that time. Dipoto resigned as Angels GM on July 1.\nThe hiring makes Servais the 10th full-time and interim manager for the Mariners since the club’s last playoff appearance in 2001.\nServais spent time with Houston, the Cubs and San Francisco during his playing career.\nAfter the Mariners won 87 games and missed the postseason by one game, Seattle finished in fourth place in the AL West. The regression led to the firing of general manager Jack Zduriencik in late August.\nSeattle also reportedly interviewed former Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek for the job.\nHoops: Popovich named U.S. coach\nGregg Popovich , who has led the San Antonio Spurs to five NBA titles, will replace Mike Krzyzewski as the U.S. men’s basketball coach following the 2016 Olympics. USA Basketball said yesterday that Popovich will take over starting with 2017 training camp and lead the Americans into the 2019 Basketball World Cup and 2020 Olympics if they qualify.\nKrzyzewski guided the Americans to consecutive Olympic gold medals and two world titles. . . .\nMiami Heat guard Gerald Green was fined $25,000 by the NBA for making menacing gestures in an exhibition game.\nMisc.: Ex-Louisville assistant resigns\nAndre McGee resigned as assistant coach at University of Missouri-Kansas City yesterday, saying he could no longer do the job as he fights “false” allegations by an escort that he hired dancers to strip and have sex with recruits and players while coaching at Louisville, where he played.\nAlso, Rick Pitino , McGee’s former boss at Louisville, said he will skip ACC media day next week on the advice of counsel because of the allegations. . . .\nBrett Stegmaier topped the leaderboard in the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open in Las Vegas in only his fifth career start on the PGA Tour. . . .\nJustin Rose shot a 4-under 66 to grab a 1-shot lead at 9-under 131 after the second round of the Hong Kong Open. . . .\nJi Eun-hee took a 1-stroke lead over Lydia Ko in the LPGA Taiwan Championship in Taipei. . . .\nJimmy Roberts , a five-time Stanley Cup champion with the Montreal Canadiens and an original member of the St. Louis Blues, died yesterday. He was 75. . . .\nThe 34th annual Alumni Reunion-Hall of Fame banquet of the Boston Park League will be Nov. 13, at Lantana’s in Randolph.
