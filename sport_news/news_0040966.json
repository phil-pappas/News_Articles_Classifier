(Photo: Submitted) 10 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nBELLEVUE - Seniors Megan Brugnone and Lauren Raifsnider decided before the season that Bellevue would qualify to the state tournament. \nRaifsnider told her teammates at districts that their practice round wouldn’t be the last of the season for 18 holes. They were right all along. \nThe Lady Red finished 11th in Division II Saturday on the Gray Course at Ohio State. It was Bellevue’s first trip to the state tournament. \n“It’s an amazing experience and feeling to go down there with my teammates to finish my senior season,” Raifsnider said. “We set it as a goal the first practice. At Ashland, we beat our team record (at 357).” \nThe Lady Red finished second at sectionals and districts this season. Brugnone advanced to districts as a junior. \nThe girls made each other better throughout the season. \n“We bonded this year,” Raifsnider said. “We’re all proud of each other and Coach (Walt Snyder) was proud. We kept pushing. We’ve played together and we know how to help each other with our games. I’ve golfed with all these girls since I started as a sophomore. \n“We push each other and keep each other calm. We golf during the summer and we know what the others need to hear.” \nBrugnone finished 45th in Columbus at 192 (91-101). Claire Berry shot 198 (92-106), Raifsnider 202 and Laini Carlson 206. \n“We’ve played in downpours or when it’s hot,” Raifsnider said. “Not when it’s this cold or windy.” \nBrugnone and Raifsnider each flirted with the 9-hole program record during the season, but it was Kennedy Miller who led the girls to state. \n“Kennedy stepped up,” Raifsnider said. “She really changed her game up and helped us out when we needed her. She really improved and she has a great future. Her 88 at districts was our ticket to state.” \nBellevue’s goal will be different next year. It will be trying to repeat history rather than make history. \nCortland Lakeview won the state tourney at 694. Shelby’s Alexis Jones was the individual champ at 152 (78-74). \nmhorn@gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:10:45.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
