I think he believes in that that when you are nearer to an interval or close to end of the game people bring the fielders in and he is comfortable hitting over the top.\" \nWaqar said Misbah wants to go out on a high note. \n\"He has said before this series,\" said Waqar of Misbah hinting retirement at the end of this series. \n\"You never know that, this might be his last series so he wants to make the most of it, we don't know what he wants to do but, of course, the way he is batting Pakistan need him.\" \nHe added: \"I think we had a good day although we had hiccups early on but it was good the way Misbah handeld things. He accelerated the innings when needed and when it was needed to control he did that.\" \nThe first match of the three-Test series ended in a draw in Abu Dhabi last week.
