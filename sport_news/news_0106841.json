(AP) - Ignacio Piatti scored in the 55th minute and Montreal secured a playoff berth with a victory over New England. \nPiatti’s goal was an entirely individual effort from winning the ball at midfield and weaving through a series of defenders to shielding New England’s Scott Caldwell with an arm bar and finishing into the top right corner from outside the 18-yard box. \nThe Impact (14-13-6, 48 points) moved ahead of the Revolution into a fourth-place tie with D.C. United in the Eastern Conference. \nThe Revs (13-12-8, 47 points) extended their winless streak to four and missed a playoff-clinching opportunity in front of a regular-season record crowd of 42,947 at Gillette Stadium. \nWith one game to go, New England leads its only challenger for the final playoff position, Orlando City, by three points and has an eight-goal advantage in the differential tiebreaker. \nCREW 2, TORONTO FC 0 \nTORONTO (AP) - Ethan Finlay and Federico Higuain scored to help Columbus beat Toronto. \nThe Crew (14-11-8) ended Toronto’s club-record winning streak at four games. Toronto dropped to 15-14-4. \nFinlay opened the scoring in the 40th minute and Federico Higuain connected in second-half stoppage time. Finlay put Gaston Sauro’s header past a sprawling Joe Bendik for his 10th goal of the season. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:23:30.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
