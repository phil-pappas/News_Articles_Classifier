The clock was stopped as the officials marked off the penalty down to the St. Joseph 6-yard line, still shy of a first down. \nWith 21 seconds remaining, BC coach Nunzio Campanile began walking out on the field thinking he was granted a timeout. \n\"I actually intended to call a timeout, then I realized I didn't have one,\" Campanile said. \"They stopped the clock for the first down/penalty. They stopped the clock so I started walking out there.\" \nThe officials were trying to figure out if it was a first down, so the clock wasn't running. St Joseph coach Augie Hoffmann said the clock never should've stopped, but acknowledged the Crusaders still probably would've had a chance to run another play before attempting a field goal. \n\"It was hysteria over there,\" Hoffmann said. \"At the end of the day, they still would have had time to try the field goal, but you just don't know what would've happened.\" \nBergen Catholic freshman Mike Kearney kicked a 21-yard field goal as time expired to tie the game at 10 and force overtime. \nâ€” Mark J.
