NCMP heads to Fort Dodge for diving on Oct. 29 and swimming on Oct. 31. \n“We haven’t been to Fort Dodge for a meet in years. It may have been when the girls’ state meet was still in Fort Dodge,” NCMP head coach Sarah Patterson said. “It’s a good pool that holds a lot of memories for me and (assistant coach) Chris (Forsyth).” \nJoining the Aquagirls and host Fort Dodge will be Algona, Boone, Cedar Falls, Charles City, Sioux City Metro, Spencer and Storm Lake. Diving competition begins at 5 p.m. Oct. 29 and swimming competition begins at noon Oct. 31. \n“There is only one team seeded ahead of us in the power rankings that is in our district — Cedar Falls. We should have a great chance to be super competitive. Where ever we are assigned, we always try to go in and make it our pool,” Patterson said. \nOther regionals are at Indianola, Johnston, Linn-Mar, Southeast Polk and Clinton. Indianola’s regional will dive at Fort Dodge also. \nThe IGHSAU diving and swimming championship meet is Nov. 6-7 in Marshalltown. \nContact Jocelyn Sheets at 641-792-3121 ext. 6535 or jsheets@newtondailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:31:15.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
