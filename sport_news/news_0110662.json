(AP Photo/Gregory Payan) (Gregory Payan / Associated Press) Luke Rhodes has started 30 consecutive games and 39 out of 41 in his career at W&M. \nWILLIAMSBURG — William and Mary linebacker Luke Rhodes, who has started 30 consecutive games and 39 out of 41 in his career, is out indefinitely with a sprained knee. \nRhodes, who was injured in the second quarter of the Tribe’s 34-18 win over New Hampshire last week, underwent an MRI on Monday. W&M coach Jimmye Laycock said Tuesday that although Rhodes will not require surgery, he’ll be out “for a while” but should return this season. \nNo. 17 William and Mary plays Hampton University Saturday and will host fourth-ranked James Madison in a CAA showdown on Oct. 31. \n“He’ll basically rest and rehab it, and we’ll get him back whenever we can get him back,” Laycock said. “Right now, they’re saying there’s a very good chance he’ll be back this year. How much, I don’t know. We’re not labeling it right now as a season-ending injury.” \nTaking his place at middle linebacker will be senior Zach Fetters, who had two tackles and an interception against UNH. \nRhodes is the Tribe’s fourth-leading tackler with 27 stops, 4 1/2 of which were behind the line of scrimmage. He was the only FCS player named to the Butkus Award preseason watch list as the top linebacker in the country. \nRhodes, one of only 11 players in W&M history to be named captain in multiple seasons, was helped off the field with 4:29 left in the second quarter on Saturday. He watched the second half from the bench on crutches with a brace on his knee. \nWithout its leader, the Tribe’s defense held New Hampshire to only a field goal in the second half. \n“The attitude was next man up,” defensive tackle Isaiah Stephens said Saturday. “(Rhodes is) a big part of the defense, everybody knows that, as the senior captain. We missed him a lot, but we had to keep on balling. We knew what to do.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:48:01.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
