JOHN FTIZHUGH â€” SUN HERALD | Buy Photo \nOcean Springs is indeed the No. 1 team on the Coast at this point of the season, but you get the feelingthere's plenty of drama ahead in the coming weeks with No. 3 St. Martin and No. 2 Gulfport ready to make a run at the top spot. \nHowever, I'm thinking this week may be a little more drama free compared to the games played so far. \nPatrick's Picks had a 10-3 record a week ago to make my overall record 72-21 this season. \nHarrison Central-St. Martin and George County-D'Iberville may be the two toughest games to pick this week, but I'm going to give it a shot. \nSt. Martin 35, Harrison Central 24: The Red Rebels (3-4, 2-0) are as hot as any team on the Coast at the moment with three wins in their last four games, but No. 3 St. Martin (6-1, 1-1) showed last week that its offense will again be tough to handle in a 63-20 win over Hancock. \nGeorge County 31, D'Iberville 21: George County (4-2, 0-2) has to be a motivated group coming off last week's heart-breaking 42-35 loss to Gulfport. The Rebels are as talented on offense as any team on the Coast and I see a win at D'Iberville (3-4, 1-1) Friday night. \nOcean Springs 28, Biloxi 10: The Greyhounds' defense put in a stellar performance in last week's 24-0 win over D'Iberville and it's difficult to see the Indians doing much better. Ocean Springs is looking more and more like a team built to win in the postseason. \nGulfport 28, Hancock 13: The No. 2 Admirals (4-2, 2-0) will be a heavy favorite on their home field. Hancock (3-4, 0-2) has had a rough go of it after winning their first three games of the season. \nGautier 27, Stone 17: Gautier (2-4, 0-2) has lost three straight, but all three were tight games against good competition - Biloxi, Picayune and Pearl River Central. I see the Gators breaking through on the road against a Stone team (2-4, 0-2) that has also lost three straight. \nHattiesburg 31, Picayune 24: This game could set up as one of the more entertaining games Friday. Hattiesburg quarterback Julian Conner is doubtful for the game, according to PineBeltSports.com. If he doesn't play, the Maroon Tide (3-3, 2-0) has a decent shot at an upset of the Tigers (6-1, 2-0). \nPearl River Central 35, Long Beach 10: The Blue Devils (5-1, 2-0) are going to be hard to handle the rest of the way in Region 4-5A. Long Beach (1-6, 0-2) continues its stretch of difficult region contests with Gautier and Picayune waiting the next two weeks. \nPascagoula 38, West Harrison 10: Pascagoula should handle its business on the road Friday night. The real meat of the region schedule starts next week when Hattiesburg comes to War Memorial Stadium in Pascagoula. \nPoplarville 31, Forrest County AHS 14: The No. 10 Hornets (4-2, 1-0) have won four straight and you have to expect them to take down FCAHS (1-6, 0-1) with relative ease. St. Stanislaus 38, Bay High 17: St. Stanislaus surprisingly had a tough time with Vancleave last week in a 47-29 win. The Rockachaws will likely make it look a little easier in the \"Battle for the Crab Trap.\" \nEast Central 21, Pass Christian 14: East Central (4-2, 1-0) moved into the Sun Herald Top 10 this week at No. 9 and we'll see how it handles success after last week's 34-21 win over Moss Point. Pass Christian (4-2, 1-0) has the defense to hang with the run-heavy Hornets. \nMoss Point 27, Vancleave 21: Moss Point (3-3, 0-1) was dealt a loss in the region opener last week, but it has a good shot to make a run at the postseason. Vancleave (2-5, 0-1) will be playing with a little more confidence after hanging with St. Stanislaus last week. \nResurrection 28, Stringer 10: After back-to-back bye weeks, Resurrection Catholic finally takes the field again. The Eagles (5-0, 1-0) should be a heavy favorite in each of their remaining region games games and Stringer (4-3, 3-0) may be the toughest test left. \nPerry Central 42, St. Patrick 10: Perry Central (4-3, 0-1) put a scare in undefeated Tylertown last week, losing 27-22. St. Patrick is still winless at 0-7 and 0-2.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:52:44.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
