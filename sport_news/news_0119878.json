He’s also currently third on the Dallas depth chart when it comes to the running back position. So he's not exactly the biggest star on the team. But according to him, that didn’t stop a Texas police officer from pulling him over yesterday morning simply to take a picture with him on the side of the road.\n“Got stopped just to take a picture,” he wrote on Instagram.\nUnfortunately, that’s all Michael has said at this point, but we’re guessing there’s going to be a much better back story for this photo. We’ll let you know what it is whenever Michael is asked about it this week.\nSend all complaints, compliments, and tips to sportstips@complex.com .\n[ via Shutdown Corner ]", "external_links": ["http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/cowboys-running-back-christine-michael-gets-pulled-over--poses-for-pic-202520844.html"], "published": "2015-10-12T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:22:54.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
