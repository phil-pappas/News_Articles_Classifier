One of the procedures involved doctors scraping the infection out of the bone, which has resulted in some bone loss.\nJust two days ago, doctors were concerned they might have to amputate to stop the infection from spreading and save Fells’s life. Fells has been in the hospital since 2 October, when the infection was first discovered.\nAccording to Ralph Vacchiano of the New York Daily News, a source close to Fells believes that the damage done to the foot is so serious that Fells’s “playing days are all but over.”\nThe Giants dedicated Sunday night’s victory over the 49ers to Fells, and the team presented him with a game ball via Skype from their Monday morning meeting. Fells tweeted the team good luck from his hospital bed on Sunday night, and Giants coach Tom Coughlin and others from the team have visited him in the hospital.\nCoughlin was upbeat about Fells’ chances of recovery. He said he was told the tight end’s condition was improving, and that he had shown steady improvement after the infection had spread to a bone in his leg.\n“I don’t think he’s out of the woods,” Coughlin said. “I didn’t say that. I think these three straight days are really a wonderful sign, but there are more tests to be done. And again, the response to the antibiotic is critical.”\nAccording to NFL .com sources, Fells suffered a toe injury, then an ankle injury, and was given a cortisone shot as treatment. After a week of ankle and foot pain, Fells’s wife took him to the emergency room on October 2 with a 104F temperature, and doctors discovered that his ankle was infected with MRSA, a dangerous infection that is resistant to many antibiotics.", "external_links": ["http://espn.go.com/newyork/nfl/story/_/id/13878761/doctors-optimistic-daniel-fells-newyork-giants-lose-foot-mrsa-infection"], "published": "2015-10-14T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:46:21.986+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
