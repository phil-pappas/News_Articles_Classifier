I thought he looked sharp today.” \nBrees is officially listed as probable, as is a number of Saints. \nSafety Jairus Byrd (knee), who has not played since week 5 of last season, is listed as probable, along with cornerback Keenan Lewis (hip), wide receiver Brandin Cooks (ankle), defensive end Cameron Jordan (back) and linebacker Dannell Ellerbe (toe). \nGuard Jahri Evans (knee) is OUT and has not been seen at practice this week. \nNew Orleans (0-3) looks for their first win of the season Sunday night when they Dallas (2-1) at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.
