So it was never (meant) to be offensive, not at all. That’s it.” \nHis on-air comment drew the ire of many from north of the border and quickly picked up steam on social media. Former star slugger Larry Walker, a native of Maple Ridge, B.C., posted his thoughts on Twitter. \n“I won 7 gold gloves. I think part of winning them was cause I could catch,” he tweeted from his verified account. \nReynolds said he was surprised at how the comment became such a hot talking point. \n“I don’t have much to say about it,” he said. “I don’t want to inflame this thing. It was just a simple comment that was a joke in the game.” \nBaseball Canada also sent out a tweet during Game 3 that included pictures of Walker, Colorado Rockies slugger Justin Morneau of New Westminster, B.C., and Toronto native Joey Votto of the Cincinnati Reds. \n“Amazing how we produced three MVPs for a country that doesn’t play a lot of baseball! #TeamC.” \nReynolds was asked if he had any words for Canadians who may have been upset by the comment. \n“Happy Thanksgiving,” he said. “I mean that’s it. I don’t have much more. I’ll talk about it during the game if it comes up. I had no idea this was going to go (viral).” \nGame 4 was scheduled for later Monday afternoon. A deciding Game 5, if necessary, would be played Wednesday in Toronto. \nThe Blue Jays have two Canadians on their playoff roster: Toronto native Russell Martin and Dalton Pompey of Mississauga, Ont., \nReynolds spent 12 seasons in Major League Baseball. The two-time all-star won three Gold Glove awards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:50:52.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
