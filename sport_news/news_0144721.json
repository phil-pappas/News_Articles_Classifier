The poster put up outside Sena Bhavan, the Shiv Sena headquarters, was circulated on the social media and picked up television channels much to the discomfiture of the BJP leaders in Maharashtra. After several BJP leaders complained, the Mumbai police got the poster pulled down. Officials from the Dadar police station said they were asked to pull down the poster to avoid violence between cadres of the two parties. Before it was removed, passages from the poster calling Modi a “dhongi” who wanted to play cricket with the terrorists from Pakistan too made it to social media networks. “Those who raise slogans in favour of Pakistan must go and live there,” one of the lines in the poster said. Later, Shiv Sena leader and Maharashtra environment minister Ramdas Kadam hit out at Maharashtra BJP chief Raosaheb Danve for supporting cricket matches between India and Pakistan. “Has Modi taken to supporting matches between India and Pakistan after becoming PM?” Kadam asked. He added that the Sena was only carrying forward Bal Thackeray’s legacy of opposing sporting and cultural ties with Pakistan till it ended cross border terrorism. The Shiv Sena went on to say it would not allow Pakistan actors Mahira Khan and Fawad Khan to promote their respective films, “Raees” and “Ae Dil Hai Mushkil” in Maharashtra. The party also forced the organisers of a Pakistan food festival to call off the event scheduled in Pune.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:12:43.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
