Haffey/Getty Images \nAvowed Red Sox fan Mayor Bill de Blasio is sticking up for injured Mets second baseman, Ruben Tejada. \nDe Blasio said Dodgers player Chase Utley was “guilty as sin” after the infielder slid into Tejada, whose leg was broken in the collision, during Saturday night’s game 2 of the National League Division Series. \n“I mean, that is a tackle,” the mayor said during the Columbus Day Parade Monday morning about Utley’s slide into second base during the seventh inning. “I was astounded.” \nMajor League Baseball suspended Utley for two games, but the Dodger quickly filed an appeal — allowing him to keep playing pending the hearing. \n“I guess he has a right to appeal,\" de Blasio said. \"That appeal should be immediately dismissed.” \nUtley's agent defended the play. \n\"Chase did what all players are taught to do in this situation — break up the double play,\" Utley's agent, Joel Wolfe, said, according to ESPN . \n\"We routinely see plays at second base similar to this one that have not resulted in suspensions. Chase feels terrible about Ruben Tejada's injury and everyone who knows him knows that he would never intentionally hurt anybody.\" \nDe Blasio said Mets fans should give Utley an old fashioned New York cheer during game 3 Monday night at Citi Field. \n“I think the people of New York City will let him know how they feel,” the mayor said. “He deserves all the boos he gets.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:23:59.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
