Below him is Russian President Vladimir Putin. (AP)\nSochi, Russia — Lewis Hamilton took a huge step toward retaining his Formula One title by winning the Russian Grand Prix on Sunday as his main rival Nico Rosberg failed to finish.\nHamilton can now win his third career title at the next race in Texas, while his Mercedes team retained the constructors’ title after a season in which the silver cars have dominated almost every race.\nHamilton started second behind Rosberg but took over the lead when his Mercedes teammate experienced a throttle problem that forced him to slow to a crawl and then come into the pits to retire.\nHamilton then cruised to victory by 5.9 seconds over Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, with Sergio Perez third for Force India, 23 seconds further behind.\nHamilton’s 42nd career win took him past his boyhood hero Ayrton Senna on the all-time list, and the defending champion said he had taken the time to enjoy his drive to victory.\n“I was really taking it in, just looking at the car,” Hamilton said. “I don’t know how many times I’ll be in that position again, so really cherishing the moment and feeling really blessed. I love driving this car and I love where we are at the moment.”\nIt was Hamilton’s ninth victory of the season and the 12th for Mercedes. With four races to go, Hamilton leads Vettel by 66 points and Rosberg by 73.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:56:52.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
