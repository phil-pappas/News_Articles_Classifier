The Bears never gave themselves a chance against the Bruins. \nBut quarterback Jared Goff, who threw three touchdown passes, vowed things will be different starting a week from Saturday at home against USC.

It's going to be a lot better from here on.\" \nThe Bears haven't beaten the Trojans since 2003, when Aaron Rodgers was their quarterback. \n\"Our guys are hurt and not happy with the way we performed,\" Cal coach Sonny Dykes said. \"We'll come back with a better sense of purpose, and we'll play well against USC.\" \nThe question is why they didn't play better Thursday night after getting five extra days to prepare. \nUCLA (5-2, 2-2) was coming off consecutive losses, including a 21-point thrashing at the hands of Stanford a week earlier. But it was the Bruins who came out of the gate fast.

If we want to beat good teams like this, we've got to start faster.\" \nHoping to secure its sixth victory to become bowl eligible and win in Southern California for the first time in six years, Cal was outplayed in every way. \n\"We didn't protect Jared very well,\" said Dykes, whose quarterback was sacked five times. \"We did not do a good job on first down -- didn't run the ball particularly well. That's putting a lot of pressure on our offensive line and quarterback.\" \nThe Bears converted a field goal on the game's first series, then totaled just 29 yards and one first down on their next four possessions. \nThe Bears' performance on defense -- where they have been much-improved this year -- was just as listless. Cal didn't force a UCLA punt until midway through the third quarter and didn't make the game-changing plays that have become a staple this season. \nThe Bears entered the week leading the Pac-12 with 21 takeaways but didn't force a turnover until Griffin Piatt recovered a fumble by Soso Jamabo with 6:22 left in the game. Cal sacked Rosen just once. \n\"We're better than we played today,\" linebacker Hardy Nickerson said. \nThe whole thing left Dykes a bit mystified. \n\"I thought our guys were fresh and excited to play, and clearly that wasn't the case,\" he said. \nUCLA piled up 357 yards and 21 first downs in the first half. The Bruins then got the ball first to start the second half and marched 80 yards before Rosen threw his third TD pass of the night, a 21-yarder to Devin Fuller that made it 33-10. \nRosen finished 34 of 47 for a career-high 399 yards. \nDykes called for Harry Adolphus to run on a fake punt play on fourth-and-10 from the Bears' 25, trailing 20-3 with six minutes left in the second quarter. The Australian rugby player was stopped well short of the first down, and the Bruins cashed in with a field goal. \n\"Bad call on my part,\" Dykes said. \"We had three to block one, and we didn't get it done.\" \nCal had no turnovers against the Bruins after committing six at Utah. Goff, intercepted five times by the Utes, was 32 for 53 for 295 yards. His three touchdowns give him 73 for his career. \nSafety Stefan McClure left the game with a shoulder injury, and linebacker Michael Barton sprained a knee. Dykes did not know the severity of either injury. \nUCLA scored 40 points against Cal for the first time since 2005, when the Bruins won 47-40.
