I knew they were going to be on fire, so I had to watch my back. I really focused toward this race because none of these guys wanted to lose.\" \nFor the rowers, this was their last opportunity to make a true statement as 2015 slips away. Borch, who finished seventh in the doubles at the London Games, has spent most of this season racing doubles, so he was anxiously awaiting the chance to mix it up with Drysdale and Synek, both of whom have concentrated on singles races. \nTop American lightweight Andrew Campbell finished fourth. \nCrow, like most of the participants more used to racing lengths of 2,000 meters and up, said that it was rewarding to come back to Philadelphia and defend her crown. She said that the short nature of the sprint adds an element of excitement that longer races simply don't provide. \n\"Very rarely do we get a chance to race the sprints,\" Crow said. \"So it's great for the spectators, and it's great for us, too, because we get a chance to show our skills. It's great to just have the chance to really mix it up and get the burn in your muscles. \n\"But this, you have to remember, is very competitive,\" she continued. \"It's fun, but it's a chance to send a message.\" \nThe regatta concludes on Sunday with high school and masters races. \n@JmitchInquirer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:17:33.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
