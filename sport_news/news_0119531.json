So they did what any reasonable group of NFL fans would do in their situation— blame the star quarterback’s girlfriend for the problem!\nMany Seahawks fans took their frustrations out on Ciara , who is obviously dating (and not having sex with! ) Russell Wilson . One fan went as far as to start a GoFundMe petition to break up the happy couple. And others took to Twitter to voice their displeasure with Ci-Ci and Wilson’s relationship.\nFortunately, all is well in Seattle again, as the Seahawks have climbed out of their early 0-2 hole to pull themselves back to .500 at 2-2. But Ciara was just asked the “Ciara Curse” that she seems to have put on the Seahawks, and she dismissed it as “silly.”\n“You know what? It comes with the territory,” she told Rolling Stone . “I think that this is a job; I wake up everyday doing exactly what I love and what I dreamed of. So the best thing to do is focus on that. You also realize when people say negative things about you [that] you’re still living your dream. When people say those types of comments, you know, that’s silly. It’s clearly silly.”\n“It’s happened to people in our world,” she continued. “It’s not a new thing when people say things—it comes with the territory. I choose to focus on the positive and focus on the cool things that are truly happening. That’s how I live my life, and I have to say life is good. Clearly those things don’t make any sense.”\n“Clearly silly”? “Clearly those things don’t make any sense”? Hmmm…Maybe so. But isn’t it kind of funny that Ciara waited until things were looking up for the Seahawks again before she dismissed all of the curse talk?\nYou buying it, Seahawks fans?\n Rolling Stone ]", "external_links": ["http://www.rollingstone.com/sports/news/does-ciara-think-she-cursed-the-seahawks-thats-silly-20151008#ixzz3o5IcCztJ"], "published": "2015-10-10T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:56:20.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
