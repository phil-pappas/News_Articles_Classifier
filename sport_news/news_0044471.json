In a fairly common procedure in South Africa for offenders sentenced to five years or less, he would have been moved from jail after one-sixth of the sentence to serve the remainder under correctional supervision at home.\nBut the justice minister intervened two days before Pistorius was to leave jail and ordered a review on a legal technicality, saying the parole board met two months too early. After a seven-week delay, officials reviewing Pistorius' case on Monday sent it back to that original parole board to consider all over again.\n\"We cannot understand ... why the matter is now to be referred back to the parole board that has no reason to make a different decision from the one that was made in the first place,\" the Pistorius family said.\n ", "external_links": ["http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/AP/RWS/jsonline.com/MAI/330875311/E/prod/PC/Basic/AT/A"], "published": "2015-10-06T11:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:03:59.071+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
