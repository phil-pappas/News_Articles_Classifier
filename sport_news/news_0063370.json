(AP) - New York's attorney general has reached an agreement with a Manhattan developer that requires offering new leases to 82 tenants in the 20-story building being converted to condominiums.\nThe attorney general's office says the 150-unit building on the upper East Side was bought almost two years ago by developer 165 E 66 Residences LLC, which began inserting early termination clauses into market-rate lease renewals.\nThe office says New York law protects tenants in buildings that are converted to condominiums, giving them a right to buy their units and in most cases prohibiting eviction purely because the building is being converted.\nThe signed settlement also requires the developer pay the money to New York City's Department of Housing Preservation and Development for housing initiatives for low-income people.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:40:33.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
