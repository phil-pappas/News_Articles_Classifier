However, the courts overturned that suspension and Brady was declared eligible a week before the season began.\nAnd now Brady and the Patriots are playing like it's 2007. Yes, they are a team on a mission just like they were after the \"Spygate\" controversy.\nThat 2007 team went 16-0 during the regular season, including a 48-27 Week 6 victory over the Cowboys at Texas Stadium, before falling in the Super Bowl. This year's team seems to be committed to running the table again, and making the Cowboys another victim along the way.\nBrady is playing as though he wants to neutralize Deflategate theorists who overlook his long, impressive championship pedigree.\nThe Patriots are unbeaten with a franchise record 119 points through three games. They didn't let their foot off the gas in a 51-17 thrashing of Jacksonville in the game before their bye week.\nThey opened the season with a 28-21 victory over Pittsburgh, and followed with a 40-32 win at Buffalo, a game that was 37-13 in the fourth quarter.\nBrady is averaging more than 370 passing yards a game, completing 72.2 percent of his passes with nine touchdowns and no interceptions. He has a 119.6 passer rating, and was a no-brainer pick for AFC player of the month honors for September.\nBrady has plenty of weapons. Tight end Rob Gronkowski is the best at his position, and has a team-leading 308 receiving yards and four touchdowns. Receiver Julian Edelman averages 10 catches a game.\n\"Obviously, it's good to be 3-0,\" Brady told reporters last week. \"I think before we really get to know what we're all about, what the other teams are all about, it's good to win the games however you can win them.\n\"That's what you've got to be able to do this time of year. But we've got a long road ahead, and I think everyone's got to be tuned into what we're trying to do in order to accomplish what our goals are.\"\nIt's no secret that Bill Belichick ranks among the top coaches in the game, arguably the best going today.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Belichick has an impressive record following a bye week. Give him extra time to prepare and scout, Belichick is going to make the most of it.\nThe Patriots are 11-4 in games following the bye week during Belichick's tenure, including 6-2 on the road.\n(c)2015 Fort Worth Star-Telegram\nVisit the Fort Worth Star-Telegram at www.star-telegram.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1733633", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1733633&h=Patriots%27+perfect+start+helps+shut+%27Gate%27", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1733633&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:13:48.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
