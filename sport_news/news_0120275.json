The first of those came Wednesday. \nThe Wildcats have spent the past few years assembling talent, and they finally got their signature victory, winning 2-1 at Thomas Worthington in the first round of the Division I tournament. Thomas did not have an impressive record, but its No. 20 seed illustrated the type of respect the program has in the area. \n\"We have talked about all year, probably since the middle of the year, that we didn't think we were getting much respect from people until they played us,\" Quackenbush said. \"When they played us, they knew we were good. We had a lot of coaches tell us that. We outplayed them, but we weren't getting the results.\" \nNewark is fighting to earn that same respect one victory at a time. The Wildcats played No. 5 seed St. Charles in a second-round match Saturday night. \nThe Wildcats have improved in all phases as a team filled with juniors and seniors capitalizes on the experience gained from three years of varsity play. This fall, Newark was strong in nonleague play against smaller Division I foes and generally held its own in Ohio Capital Conference-Ohio Division play despite being winless with just two ties. \nThe tournament victory was a critical mark of progress. The Wildcats appeared on the cusp the past two seasons, but they fell at home to lower-seeded teams. \n\"It brings the spirit up because the past few years we haven't done as well in the tournaments,\" senior goalkeeper Killian Slone said. \"Because we did well, they will strive to do better next year. ... Instead of being individually talented, we have become more of a team able to play off each other and work together. That benefits us in the long run.\" \nThis season, Quackenbush could have looked for an easier victory in the first round, but he put the Wildcats in a challenging spot to see whether they could not only grab one win but possibly even advance farther. \nThe Wildcats delivered, scoring twice in the final 25 minutes to stun Thomas. \n\"That's what we are good at: When we get the ball on the ground, settle the ball and find feet, we are a really good team,\" Quackenbush said. \"That is what we did in the second half.\" \nThings change next season as they do for all Newark programs. The move to the new OCC-Northeast Division should be beneficial, with New Albany expected to be the top program while Newark attempts to contend with Big Walnut, Groveport and Canal Winchester, but it will not mean automatic success. \nThe Wildcats have the pieces to make 2016 a breakout season with a junior class led by Jed Quackenbush, Quinn Anderson, River Schneider and Drew Harvey. Now, they have the starting point. \n\"I think our springboard is winning this game and competing like we have throughout the OCC even though we didn't get the results,\" Jon Quackenbush said. \"Other than Gahanna, we had a legitimate chance to win every game.\" \nTell Kurt Snyder what you think at ksnyder@newarkadvocate.com. 7 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1S38xfl MORE STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:51:31.830+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
