Robinson’s family has not filed a suit.\nChris Nowinski of the Concussion Legacy Foundation confirmed the diagnosis in Robinson’s case and said that 88 of 92 N.F.L. players whose brains have been tested there have shown evidence of C.T.E., along with 33 others who played college or high school football.\nSTEELER FINED OVER TRIBUTE Steelers defensive end Cam Heyward said he was fined by the N.F.L. for paying tribute to his late father.\nHeyward wrote on Twitter that the league penalized him for having the words “Iron Head” on his eye black during a game. His father, Craig Heyward, spent a decade as an N.F.L. running back and went by the nickname “Ironhead” for his physical style of play. He died in 2006 at 39 after a lengthy battle with cancer.\n“I’m just trying to draw attention to the disease that took my father’s life,” Heyward said.\nAROUND THE LEAGUE New England Patriots offensive lineman Nate Solder was placed on season-ending injured reserve after injuring an arm against the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday. ... The Indianapolis Colts reinforced their ground game by re-signing running back Ahmad Bradshaw. ... The Atlanta Falcons will be without linebacker Justin Durant and center Mike Person for Thursday night’s game against the New Orleans Saints.\n ", "external_links": ["http://a1.nyt.com/assets/article/20151014-102019/images/foundation/logos/"], "published": "2015-10-15T05:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:44:50.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
