We break down the top 10 teams and people who can't stand New England. \nAtlanta at New Orleans: Falcons defensive end Jonathan Babineaux spoke about the Falcons-Saints rivalry this week, saying: \"It's two brothers that don't get along. I think we're similar and have been throughout the past years. All these games that we've played amongst each other, it's less than seven points. Sometimes, it's less than three points. It's always a close battle, no matter what our record is. It's always going to be a great matchup.\" All that, and I’ve got the Falcons winning by 20. \nThe Pick: Falcons 42, Saints 22 \nSUNDAY \nCincinnati at Buffalo: Can we start the Adam Jones Pro Bowl campaign yet? Can I put his name in ink next to Aqib Talib ’s as the AFC’s starting cornerbacks? Revis and Chris Harris, Jr. may disagree, but few players have had more of an impact on defense as Jones this season. Bills keep it close, but Cincinnati’s rolling. \nThe Pick: Bengals 20, Bills 16 \nDenver at Cleveland: With public pressure mounting, a fan base ready to explode, and TMZ reports knocking on the door — the Browns have resisted making a quarterback change, sticking with a plan they laid out in August. McCown is the starter and mentor, and Johnny Manziel is the long-term answer who’ll be on the bench until he’s fully ready to be an everyday starter. Unlike so many teams that rush the need to start the young guy, the Browns are waiting until this one is ready. And in the meantime, McCown’s been awesome the past two weeks. It’s going to be a hostile environment for Denver on Sunday. It’s time the Broncos ’ anemic offense isn’t bailed out by their outstanding defense. \nThe Pick: Browns 20, Broncos 17 \nChicago at Detroit: I know Week 4's Monday night’s loss to the Seahawks ended in heartbreaking fashion, but you can’t respond by losing 42-17 at home. The Lions fans are bringing paper lunch bags to the stadium and it’s only October. This can get worse. Two division games at home in a row. Fail to show up for this one and the Vikings game next week, and that could be a very interesting London week that follows. I’m taking the Bears and am fascinated to see how this Lions team responds to last week’s disaster. \nThe Pick: Bears 24, Lions 20 \nHouston at Jacksonville: Bill O’Brien is going with Brian Hoyer , but as we’ve learned, that can change at the drop of a hat or with one bad pass. The Jaguars are getting healthier. Julius Thomas should be the guy to watch this week, fantasy football owners. Put that down in ink. \nThe Pick: Jaguars 27, Texans 23 \nKansas City at Minnesota: The Chiefs suffered a devastating blow in losing Jamaal Charles for the year and I’m not sure it’s something they can bounce back from. The offense has been struggling enough, and now it loses its top weapon. The Vikings are winners of five straight at home. Make it six. If they keep winning in that college stadium they’re playing in, they may have to delay the opening of WILF WORLD next year. \nThe Pick: Vikings 24, Chiefs 13 \nWashington at New York Jets : Sheldon Richardson is back and that’s an embarrassment of riches for a defensive line that’s been as good as any in football this season. But I can’t dismiss the Redskins just yet. They entered their Week 5 contest in Atlanta as the sport’s top rushing team, but left as No. 12 with just 51 yards on the ground. This one won’t be pretty, but I think Washington wins in its second trip to New York in four weeks. The NFC East is still very much up for grabs; offensive coordinator Sean McVay draws up the game plan and the players deliver with a big win for the Redksins, here. \nThe Pick: Redskins 26, Jets 24 \nArizona at Pittsburgh: What a Monday night win for the Steelers. Up against it the whole game, struggling to move the ball, the defense — which has struggled all season — keeping them in it, Michael Vick bursts out for a 24-yard scramble in crunch time, and Bell gets it done in the end. Just awesome. It won’t be so easy against this loaded Cardinals team, though. You can have the others, but this is your game of the week, and after a week of practicing in West Virginia, I think Bruce Arians wills his team to victory in the stadium he used to call home. Oh, and by the way, Chris Johnson is second in the league in rushing. What magic power does GM Steve Kiem have out there in the desert? \nThe Pick: Cardinals 24, Steelers 20 \nMiami at Tennessee: I have no doubt at all that interim head coach Dan Campbell can motivate this Dolphins team to win a few games right off the bat with a more aggressive, angrier style of football. Whether he can sustain that over the course of a whole season is another story. Hey, Ken Whisenhunt is 4-28 in his last 32 games as an NFL head coach. Not picking him to win on Sunday, either. \nThe Pick: Dolphins 27, Titans 17 \nCarolina at Seattle: One of the things I’ve always loved about Russell Wilson is the way he pulls things out in the fourth quarter. Yet, the Seahawks have failed to hold fourth-quarter leads in all three of their losses this season, including a 17-point lead last Sunday in Cincinnati. Wilson has beaten Cam Newton every time they’ve played. The Seahawks are inching towards “Must Win” mode. I think Wilson gets it done here. \nThe Pick: Seahawks 24, Panthers 16 \nSan Diego at Green Bay: The Packers allowed a season-worst 191 rushing yards last Sunday, but Todd Gurley isn’t in that Chargers backfield. I love the idea of a Rivers-Rodgers shootout, but I just don’t see this San Diego offense being able to keep up with Green Bay at Lambeau. The Pack have won 12 straight at home and I don’t see them losing there all season. \nThe Pick: Packers 37, Chargers 20 \nBaltimore at San Francisco: Unfamiliar territory for the Ravens here. Tough two weeks ahead, too. In San Francisco followed by in Arizona? I don’t know. I rarely question Joe Flacco and John Harbaugh, but this team is so banged up that I didn’t recognize them Sunday vs. the Browns. Colin Kaepernick and Co. need this one. I think they get it. Name to watch here? Outside linebacker Aaron Lynch , who was all over the field for the 49ers last Sunday. \nThe Pick: 49ers 23, Ravens 17 \nNew England at Indianapolis: The Patriots outscored the Colts 88-29 in two meetings last year, and that was before the Colts tattled on the Patriots about the air pressure in footballs. If you think the Patriots are above making this one personal, you don’t know the Patriots. \nThe Pick: Patriots 38, Colts 20 \nMONDAY NIGHT \nNew York Giants at Philadelphia : The Eagles aren’t the people’s favorites they were in August anymore and after Sunday’s two red-zone interceptions, Sam Bradford was being compared to Ryan Leaf. But Philadelphia bounced back, blew out the Saints and got their second win. I think they take advantage of the Giants’ myriad of injuries on Monday night and DeMarco Murray nets his second big game in a row. The NFC East is wide, wide open. \nThe Pick: Eagles 31, Giants 20 \nReader Email of the Week NFL supports Breast Cancer Awareness Month by going pink \nPeter, \nI can’t get over the fact I drafted CJ Anderson in the first round of my fantasy football draft. Fantasy football guys on TV are like weathermen. No accountability. I could list a dozen of them that said CJ Anderson was the breakout guy this year and here we are, five weeks in, and he’s not even starting on my team. \nDylan, Monticello, New York \nDylan, \nIt’s a great little niche and one that I can’t hate on. Those guys all do the work and have legions of fans. I tried watching one of the fantasy football TV shows you’re talking about recently and they had all these acronyms I’ve never heard of and were referring to players by their first names and I quickly realized I work in a different world than they do. My advice as always when it comes to fantasy football is to read and listen to the beat reporters. I can’t name any in Denver who were putting C.J. Anderson ’s name alongside Matt Forte or Adrian Peterson . \nWeek 6 Cheat Sheet Trivia Answer of the Week \nFran Tarkenton and Peyton Manning are the only other quarterbacks in NFL history to start out 4-0 four or more times.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:29:36.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
