(WZZM)- There are many reasons why Austin Spratling from Kellogsville High School wants to attend college, to build a better future, to obtain a career in the criminal justice field and to make his parents proud. As this weeks Meijer Scholar Athlete, Austin has already achieved the latter statement by being a positive role model in his school and community. \nThe senior has maintained a 3.7 GPA, all while taking multiple honors courses. He is a member of the National Honors Society, and a youth leader for his church. Meijer Scholar Athlete: Austin Spratling \n\"Faith is a big part of my family and what I believe,\" said Austin. \nSports has been another big part of his life as well. He's excelled in football as a rare four year varsity starting quarterback, and has helped the Rockets to a 2-0 conference start this season.( 3-2 overall) The 6-foot athlete has also been on the varsity basketball team for four years and the varsity baseball team for three, all conference for two. \n\"I'm a very competitive person. Whether it's just playing ping pong or out on the football field, I'm very competitive. I get mad over the littlest things when it comes to sports and I just love the brotherhood too. We're a big family, JV and Varsity,\" said Austin. \nAt the center of his football family is his head coach Don Galster, who Austin credits for teaching him many lessons that transcend beyond the football field. \n\"He has taught me, no matter what happens in the game or what happens in a specific play in school, you know that's in the past and you got to get over it and get to the next play. Don't let something push you down and not get back up, always get back up and push back harder,\" said Austin.
