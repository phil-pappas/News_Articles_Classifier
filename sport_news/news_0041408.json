And his own conducting baton. Twice during the program at Umstattd Performing Arts Hall, Swann took over the podium from Maestro Gerhardt Zimmermann. The first time was to conduct the fight song for USC, Swann’s alma mater. The second time was for a more questionable purpose. \"Sacrilegious as it may be, I’m going to conduct the Cleveland Browns fight song,” Swann said almost sheepishly, his team of glory, the Pittsburgh Steelers, of course being the archrival of the Browns. After asking the audience to not capture the moment on video, he led the orchestra with notable flair and confidence. Later, Swann did an impressive job narrating “Freddie the Football,” a comedic novelty number with lots of orchestral starts, stops and sound effects. Swann gamely told the story of Freddie, mocked for his shape by all the round balls, but who goes on to be the official game ball of the Super Bowl. In introducing Swann, Zimmermann fondly recalled watching him and Terry Bradshaw play with the Steelers, mentioned Swann’s four Super Bowl rings and noted that Swann’s “spectacular balletic catches” with the Steelers were the result of dance lessons he’d been forced into by his mother while growing up. For his part, Swann thanked Canton “for having me back,” and said he’d visited with the McKinley Bulldogs football team Thursday afternoon. The pops concert, titled “Soundtracks of the Gridiron,” attracted about 570 people. The program was an enjoyable hodgepodge of football-related music suitable for a full symphony orchestra, and enhanced by NFL Films visuals on a large screen above the stage. A montage of scenes from the popular football film “Rudy” accompanied a suite of five themes from the film’s score composed by Jerry Goldsmith. As the orchestra -- dressed in long-sleeved gridiron T-shirts -- played the rousing Ohio State fight song, accompanied by much clapping along, video of script Ohio unfolded overhead. In the lobby before the concert, a group of female friends from Jackson Township were sporting football garb. “I watched Lynn Swann in Pittsburgh for years. We lived there when he was in his glory days,” said Marian Mann. Nancy Maddox, in an OSU sweater and Swarovski crystal pin, quipped that she’s a Buckeyes fan “if they’re winning.” Another symphony regular, Nancy Pryce, was wearing a Michigan Wolverines sweater. “I’m taking my life in my hands,” she joked. “I think it’s a wonderful idea to merge forces with the Hall of Fame. We’ve seen Dave Baker (the hall’s executive director) come to concerts.” Page 2 of 2 - And there Baker was Thursday, enjoying the concert from an aisle seat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:40:39.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
