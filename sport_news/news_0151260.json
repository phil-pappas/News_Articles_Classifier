Fans will have a chance to have their photo taken with the trophy throughout the game between the Pirates (3-0) and the Bruins (2-1). \n“This trophy is something that people only get to read about or see on television and it is a special opportunity for our fans to see it up close, especially on a Division III campus,” said Bob Castle, the Pirates’ assistant athletics director for development and sales. \nFirst awarded in 1935, the trophy was later named for John Heisman, who had been active in college athletics as a football player; a head football, basketball and baseball coach; and an athletic director. \nIt’s given out each December by the Heisman Trophy Trust to that college football player who “best exhibits the pursuit of excellence with integrity.” The current holder of the trophy is former Oregon quarterback, and current Tennessee Titan, Marcus Mariota. \nThe Heisman will be on display at Wendle, located 8900 N. Division St., through Monday. Thomas Clouse", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:20:40.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
