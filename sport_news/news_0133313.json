Down by a goal, Providence tied the game when Frankie Vatrano scored with 1:49 to go in regulation. In overtime, with the teams playing three-on-three, Wilson took a pass from Derrick Pouliot and beat Providence goalie Zane McIntyre from in tight. Oscar Sundquist received the second assist. “Two young teams. Goalies played well. We had some good looks in the first period. They had them in the second. Our young guys battled. Could have gone either way at the end,’’ said Providence coach Bruce Cassidy. Murray, who was American Hockey League rookie of the year, goalie of the year and a first-team all-star last season, was terrific in stopping the first 39 shots he faced before Vatrano beat him with a shot from the left wing boards. Alex Khokhlachev assisted. “Our line was getting opportunities all night,’’ said Vatrano. “(Khokhlachev) gave me a great pass earlier on that shift and I hit the post. Then he made a nice play on the wall. Butchie was telling us all night to get pucks to the net. It was a good feeling (when the shot went in).’’ Wilson, a former UMass-Lowell winger, opened the scoring at 6:44 of the second period on a turnaround shot after Conor Sheary, a former UMass-Amherst player, dug the puck off the boards. Kael Mouillierat was credited with the second assist. Providence, with nine rookies in the lineup, went 0-for-6 on the power play. “Our power play was disjointed, to say the least. I can’t say I’m shocked. It wasn’t good all week (in practice). We’ve got some issues there. On paper we’re not a team that’s going to score five a night 5-on-5. We’re going to need that part of the game,’’ Cassidy said. Rookie goalie McIntyre made 39 saves. Cassidy was pleased with his play. “He looked a little bit nervous playing the puck at times, but he controlled his rebounds, stood in there pretty well and made some good saves,’’ he said. The P-Bruins and Penguins played a scoreless first period in which Providence had the better of the chances and ran up a 17-9 advantage in shots. The P-Bruins had some good zone time, but failed to score on three first-period power plays. Wilkes-Barre/Scranton didn’t get its first shot — a long wrister that Providence’s McIntyre gloved easily — until nearly halfway through the period. Page 2 of 2 - The P-Bruins were able to get some good chances off the rush, but either misfired or were held off by Murray. Providence had a good chance when Zack Phillips found Khokhlachev in the neutral zone and the center from Moscow shielded the puck with his body and cut in on Murray, who made the save Justin Hickman and Vatrano also had good opportunities that were stopped by Murray. The first fight of the season broke out with 10:20 to go in the first as Providence’s Anthony Camara and the Pens’ Steve Oleksy went at it with neither winning a clear decision. After Wilson’s second-period goal, McIntyre made a nice save when Sheary broke in alone and went to his backhand. The former North Dakota netminder made another good stop on Will O’Neill with 9:44 to go. With the teams playing with four skaters each, Austin Czarnik had two glittering chances on a 4-on-3 power play. Murray stopped his first shot and Czarnik fired his second shot wide. After Providence’s Anton Blidh drew a holding penalty by Pouliot after some good work on the end boards, Murray kicked out a Tommy Cross slapper and then denied Vatrano. The P-Bruins had another good opportunity in the last 10 seconds of the period as Hickman tipped a point shot by Chris Casto, but Murray kicked it out. Providence outshot the Pens, 13-12, in the second period. Providence’s Malcolm Subban missed the game with a lower-body injury and is questionable for the P-Bruins next game, at home against Portland on Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:18:29.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
