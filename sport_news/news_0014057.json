First, just appreciate college football's regular season, which delivers drama and excitement on a weekly basis like no other sport. \nIt's a regular season that gives us zany, game-winning touchdowns by dropped punt snaps and blocked field goals on seemingly a weekly basis. At this rate, the band will be out on the field very soon at a stadium near you. The regular season scoffs at your weekly playoff projections, sticking out its tongue to mock us for daring to predict where this season will take us. You can't turn away, even on this Saturday with a \"lesser\" slate, because you never know what you might see. \nGeorgia Tech had lost five straight games. Undefeated Florida State had won 28 straight ACC games dating to 2012. Seminoles All-American kicker Robert Aguayo had been 20 of 20 on his career in field goals attempted during the fourth quarter. \nNaturally, Aguayo's 56-yard field goal was blocked by Georgia Tech 's Patrick Gamble . Naturally, Georgia Tech coach Paul Johnson did one of those, “No, no, get away from the ball” waves, as did some players, content to live for another day in overtime. So naturally, Georgia Tech's Lance Austin gravitated toward the ball, saw it there all by itself, and thought, “Huh? Why not?” Seventy-eight yards later, Austin was in the end zone. \nGo make a play; figure out what the heck happened later. That's the story of another chaotic week of a wild college football season. \nUSC freshman linebacker Cameron Smith had allowed 82 percent of his targets being completed coming into Saturday, according to Pro Football Focus. So of course, he intercepted three of Utah quarterback Travis Wilson 's passes, including a pick-six touchdown. For the first time since 1975, an unranked USC team beat a top-3 opponent. Of course, Utah was actually the underdog Saturday as the betting line increased to a touchdown before kickoff. Talent is talent and the Trojans have more of it. Imagine if USC athletic director Pat Haden had made the right decision in August and not allowed Steve Sarkisian to even start this season. \nThe Pac-12 is now the first Power Five conference without an undefeated team. USC 42, Utah 24 doesn't doom the Pac-12, or even Utah, for a playoff spot. Don't fall into that trap and definitively write either off. But the Utes, which still have a win over Michigan , now have a serious blemish and the Pac-12 now left itself open to the playoff doubters. \n“Let me not talk about one loss or undefeated or two loss,” Pac-12 commissioner Larry Scott said a couple days ago before Utah's loss. “I believe the Pac-12 champion will have the toughest road to the playoff because of the nine-game conference schedule, the strength of schedule, and the fact we have a championship game. I think we're as deep as advertised. Teams that early in the season the media thought would be on top of our conference wound up not being so at this stage.” \nUtah and Stanford are the Pac-12's only one-loss teams. Washington State, which has its first three-game winning streak in the Pac-12 since 2003, may be Stanford's biggest challenger in the North. That's not good news. Don't forget, Washington State lost to Portland State in Week 1. \nThe Pac-12 hasn't done much out of conference. Stanford has a loss to Northwestern on its resume and will need to become this year's Ohio State as an improving team that looks impressive each week. So far, so good. Stanford still has a potential resume builder Nov. 28 against Notre Dame . Oregon lost to Michigan State . Washington fell to Boise State . Arizona State lost by three touchdowns to Texas A&M. USC dropped a game at Notre Dame. Oregon State got blown out by Michigan. Utah beat Michigan in Week 1, but that's about it for the Pac-12. \nUSC's win over Utah helps Notre Dame. If the Irish run the table, it's hard to see how a one-loss Pac-12 champion can get in the playoff ahead of Notre Dame. The Irish would have wins over USC and Stanford and a two-point loss at Clemson , the possible ACC champion. \nThe ACC's playoff hopes? They now rest squarely on the shoulders of Clemson, which quietly looks like a legit playoff contender. Given Florida State 's loss, there's a smaller margin of error for the ACC if Clemson loses. It's debatable whether the Tigers could recover from a loss given the caliber of the ACC. Also, some of the luster got taken off Clemson-Florida State in two weeks. Now the ACC needs Clemson to beat Florida State and win out. \nThere are 12 undefeated teams remaining in college football -- more than any other year at this time during the College Football Playoff/BCS era, which dates back to 1998. Last year through eight weeks, Mississippi State , Florida State, Ole Miss and Marshall were the only undefeated teams. Eventual national champion Ohio State was ranked 13th in the AP Top 25. \nSo sure, it's time to start paying attention to the playoff race. But don't forget to enjoy the journey. Take a lesson from, of all people, Georgia Tech's normally cranky coach. As police escorted Johnson off the field after the Florida State stunner, Johnson stuck out his tongue, gave a goofy smile and shook his head side to side. By now, we all feel a little punch drunk this season. \nWhat We Learned This Week \n1. Baylor 's quarterbacking future becomes cloudy. A special season for Baylor turned complicated Saturday when standout quarterback Seth Russell suffered a neck injury. According to Baylor, Russell has a fracture in one of the bones of his neck and will see a specialist on Monday. Russell has thrown for 2,104 yards and 29 touchdowns in his first year starting while gaining some Heisman Trophy attention. The injury occurred with six minutes left in the fourth quarter of Baylor's 45-27 victory over Iowa State as Russell was scrambling and attempted to bully his way to a first down. For the time being, true freshman Jarrett Stidham takes over at quarterback and wide receiver Chris Johnson returns to quarterback to become his backup. Stidham, a highly-recruited player, is 24 of 28 for 337 yards with seven total touchdowns and no interceptions; he has played in every game this season. \nIt's a good thing Baylor burned Stidham's redshirt early to get him reps. It's not clear how long Russell will be out. The Bears are off next week before a Nov. 5 road trip at Kansas State. Still looming for Baylor is a three-week stretch against Oklahoma , Oklahoma State and TCU . All is not lost for Baylor, but its first test of adversity this season just hit. \n2. Jake Coker can lead a game-winning drive. Alabama survived. Every year, there's one or two games an Alabama quarterback must win with a late drive. Coker's came Saturday with Alabama trailing Tennessee 14-13 and under six minutes to play. Already with one loss, the Crimson Tide's national championship hopes were hanging by a thread. Coker hit fade routes downfield to ArDarius Stewart and Calvin Ridley ; the duo made key athletic catches before Derrick Henry scored the eventual winning touchdown. Alabama's terrifying defensive line sacked Joshua Dobbs twice and forced a fumble on the Vols' final drive to secure the 19-14 victory. \nAlabama is going to need more explosive plays to win a national championship. It wasn't a pretty win, but it's not always pretty this 2015 season for a lot of playoff contenders. Coker showed he can make the necessary clutch throws, and as scary as Saturday was for Alabama, that's a welcome development heading into a Nov. 7 showdown against LSU . \n3. Ole Miss will keep making the SEC sweat. The SEC needs Ole Miss to lose again or seriously risk getting shut out of the playoff. If that sounds cold, well, such is life in the playoff era. The Rebels, however, showed some heart and throttled Texas A&M 23-3 even without injured defensive lineman Robert Nkemdiche . (Curiously, Texas A&M's lifeless offense replaced struggling quarterback Kyle Allen with Jake Hubenak , not freshman standout Kyler Murray . Kevin Sumlin told reporters the decision to play Hubenak as backup as “based on practice.” Keep an eye on this story.) \nDespite two losses, Ole Miss controls its SEC West fate. If this is the Ole Miss team that consistently shows up, it's conceivable the Rebels could win out against this schedule: at Auburn , vs. Arkansas , vs. LSU, at Mississippi State. If the two-loss Rebels win the SEC, the conference may need help getting in the playoff. The longer Ole Miss keeps winning, the more the SEC will sweat. \n4. J.T. Barrett stars at quarterback. Urban Meyer's pick of Cardale Jones to start the year surprised me. As good as Jones was last year, it was a small body of work and Barrett's running ability always seemed like a better fit in Ohio State's offense. Back as the starter Saturday, Barrett showed no signs that he'll let Meyer make a switch again. Barrett completed 14-of-18 passes for 224 yards and three touchdowns, plus he ran for 101 yards and two scores. The Buckeyes rolled 49-7 over Rutgers and their offense is clicking again. There's two more exhibition games left -- Minnesota and Illinois -- before Ohio State's two-game regular season arrives against Michigan State and Michigan. Barrett and this offense could be rolling by that point. \n5. Tragedy strikes Stillwater again. It's difficult to comprehend what happened Saturday morning in Stillwater, Okla. Police say a drunk driver plowed her vehicle into a crowd attending Oklahoma State's Sea of Orange homecoming parade. Four people, including a 2-year-old child, were killed and 33 others injured. The Cowboys played their homecoming game against Kansas with heavy hearts and won 58-10. \nOklahoma State considered postponing the game. Even as the contest began, some of the bodies remained at the scene of the crash less than three blocks from the stadium. Sadly, Oklahoma State is used to tragedies. Two plane crashes in 2001 and 2011 killed members of the Cowboys' men's and women's basketball programs. This latest tragedy is so heartbreaking because it's preventable. It's simple: Don't drink and drive. Oklahomans will band together to help each other out, as they always do. Prayers to everyone impacted by something so senseless. \nStat of the Day I \nSince being ranked No. 3 by the College Football Playoff committee in Week 11 of 2014, Auburn has a 5-7 record over the past year. The five wins: Samford, Louisville , Jacksonville State, San Jose State and Kentucky . Auburn's 54-46 loss to Arkansas in four overtimes makes Gus Malzahn the leading contender to become the SEC West coach who finishes last while making at least $4 million. The Tigers have already lost to the two teams directly ahead of them, Arkansas and Mississippi State. Only a collapse by Ole Miss will keep Auburn out of last place. \nStat of the Day II \nPittsburgh 's game-winning drive to beat Syracuse went 19 plays for 89 yards, taking 9:20 off the clock. The Panthers extended the eventual game-winning drive when punter Ryan Winslow converted a pass for a first down on a fake punt. Pitt, Duke and North Carolina remain undefeated in ACC play atop the Coastal Division. The three teams all play each other over the next three weeks. By that point, we will either have more clarity or be more confused about who will play Clemson or Florida State for the ACC championship. \nScore of the Day \nClemson 58, Miami 0. The Hurricanes hit rock bottom with their most lopsided loss in school history. Clemson is legit and a real threat to go undefeated and reach the CFP. Still, it's inexcusable for Miami to be this bad. “I told the team that's completely my responsibility for not getting them ready to play,” Hurricanes coach Al Golden explained to reporters. It's pretty clear Miami needs to fire Golden. Maybe the Hurricanes can't be a dynasty again, but they certainly should be taking better advantage of the football talent in South Florida. Miami plays in such a weak division that it could be an instant ACC Coastal champion by hiring the right coach. \nDivision Tiebreaker Chaos \nWe're getting closer to your favorite time of year: getting headaches trying to understand tiebreakers that determine conference championship game participants. This week we examine the possibility that the Big Ten East champion may not be known until four days before the Big Ten Championship Game. How and why could this happen? Say Ohio State, Michigan State and Michigan all finish with one conference loss. This is certainly possible. Michigan State's only defeat could come against Ohio State on Nov. 21, and the Buckeyes' only loss could be a week later at Michigan. \nUnder that scenario, the Big Ten tiebreaker would be the final CFP rankings of the regular season.The highest-rated team in the committee's rankings would win the division, unless the two highest-rated teams are within one spot of each other. In that case, the head-to-head result of the top two ranked teams would determine the Big Ten East representative. Those CFP rankings don't get released until Tuesday, Dec. 1 at 7 p.m. ET -- four days before the Big Ten Championship Game in Indianapolis. Think logistics might be a nightmare for fans and teams? \nQuote of the Week \n“You can't believe what just happened! What a time to be alive!” -- ESPN2 announcer Mark Jones on Georgia Tech's blocked field goal return for a touchdown to beat Florida State. \nFollow and read more from Jon Solomon on Facebook and Twitter .
