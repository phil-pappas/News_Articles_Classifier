Bowling Green is led by senior quarterback Matt Johnson, who has six 300-yard passing games in his six starts under second-year coach Dino Babers. Johnson’s eye-opening effort was a 491-yard, six-touchdown bonanza in Bowling Green’s shocking 48-27 win at Maryland Sept. 12.\nUMass (1-3, 0-0) counters with Blake Frohnapfel, who is averaging 303.5 yards passing per game. Frohnapfel set a program mark for passing yards (589) and equaled the mark for touchdown throws (five) against the Falcons in last year’s narrow 47-42 loss in Amherst.\nJohnson’s favorite target is sophomore Roger Lewis, who has posted three 200-yard receiving games in the last four games, including a 10-catch, 201-yard effort and a touchdown in last week’s 28-22 road win over Buffalo. UMass senior Tajae Sharpe last week set his school’s single-game mark for catches (15) and extended his career record to 211 receptions. Sharpe is working on a 39-game consecutive streak with at least one catch, third-longest in Division 1.\n“Bowling Green is a really good football team. They have a real good offense. They have good running backs and a good receiver and a good offensive line. When you look at the other side, it’s like looking at ourselves,” said UMass tri-captain Jovan Santos-Knox. “They have a good receiver in Lewis just like we have Tajae (Sharpe).”\nConsidering the game might hinge on which team holds onto the ball best, consider that BG owns a turnover margin of plus-2. UMass, which has lost all three prior meetings, enters at minus-3. That’s where Santos-Knox should make an impact. The linebacker, who has been added to the watch list for the Nagurski Award (given to the nation’s top defensive player), paces the Minutemen in tackles (33), tackles for loss (four), and sacks (two) this season.\n“He’s just a model player you look for in recruiting,” said inside linebackers coach Charles Walker. “His leadership has gotten better. He’s one of those guys players look up to. He plays hard. He’s emotional. He channels everything he has out onto the field.”\nWhile BG is confident, armed with a pair of wins over Big Ten competition (Maryland and Purdue), the UMass contingent is also riding high after its 24-14 home win over Florida International one week ago.\n“The coaches put together a great game plan last week. We went out and executed. We gave a lot of attention to detail. We were ready. The preparation was the key,” said Santos-Knox. “Everyone has confidence. Everyone was out here at practice firing around this week. Everyone is playing loose. Without a doubt, everyone is confident. It was a huge confidence boost.”\nStill, UMass coach Mark Whipple remains cautious.\n“They’ve got great players. Matt Johnson was the Player of the Year in the league before he got hurt last year. Their skill guys are just better. The wide receiver is way more explosive. When they get in the red zone, we have to make them kick field goals,” Whipple said.\n“Bowling Green is very stout up front. They’ve got a bunch of guys. Their offensive line is big. They mix it up with their tight end. They’re the best team in the league. We have a huge challenge in front of us. We have to play as hard as we did last week.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:39:19.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
