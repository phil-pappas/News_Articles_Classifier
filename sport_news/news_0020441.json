The 15-team field, which includes a pair of Louisville teams, will play two rounds of 18 holes on the first day, followed by one round on Tuesday that starts at 9:15 a.m. \nThe Louisville Red team, teeing off first, consists of Molly Skapik, Laura Restrepo, Katie Mitchell, Shannon Gramley, and Olivia Cason. Louisville's Black team features Lexie Long, Louise Oxner, Ellen Kehoe, Jacqueline Twitty, and Meredith Moir. \nAdmission is free to the event, and live results will be available on Golfstat.com. \nLouisville enters the tournament tabbed No. 19 by Golfstat, the highest-ranked program in the field. More than half (eight) of the 14 schools are currently ranked in the top 70 by Golfstat, including six rated at No. 51 or better. \nHistorically, the Cardinals have fared rather well at the event. Louisville won its third-consecutive team title last year, compiling the best third-round score for the victory. \nThe Cardinals, collectively, have a pair of top-five finishes that includes a third-place showing last week at the Tar Heel Invitational. Louisville finished ahead of a host of Golfweek's top-50 programs, including No. 2 Alabama, No. 11 Virginia, No. 14 Tennessee, No. 28 Oregon, No. 30 LSU, No. 34 South Carolina, and No. 35 Auburn. \nSkapik had the best performance of her young career, posting a collegiate-best 2-under-par 214 to tie for third. She opened the event with a personal-best 2-under-par 70. Restrepo and Mitchell each tied for 18th, while Long tied for 29th. \nOver the course of the season, Mitchell leads the Cardinals in stroke average (72.88) in eight rounds of play. Restrepo is second on the team in average (74.25), and Kehoe, a freshman, has the third-best average at 75.20. Mitchell, Cason, and Skapik each have recorded three rounds even or below par. \nFor the latest information on Louisville women's golf, log on to GoCards.com, or, for up-to-the-minute updates, follow the team's Twitter account at www.twitter.com/UofLWGolf or on Facebook at www.facebook.com/LouisvilleWomensGolf.
