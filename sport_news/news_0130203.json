He’s a professional,” Hines, who played 77 Tests for the Scots, said. \n“They are there to do a job. He thinks he has seen something. \n“World Rugby have put him there because they are happy with his neutrality. \n“That’s for them to sort out and not us.” \nRegardless, Scotland remained shattered at the news two of their best forwards would be unavailable to take on the Wallabies. \nA spokesman for the national team said they were “disappointed” by Judicial Officer Christopher Quinlan QC’s decision, adding: “We will consider carefully the full written judgment before making a decision on any future action.” \nThey have 48 hours to appeal.
