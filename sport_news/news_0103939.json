Opelousas has scored once, in its 69-8 district loss to Carencro. \nJosh Guidry, a former Opelousas assistant and now the head football coach at Beau Chene, said the game is important for reasons other than bragging rights. \n“For us, it’s a must win. If we win, we’re in the playoffs. We’ve played probably the best (in 4-4A) already and now we are focused in getting into the playoffs,” Guidry said. \nGuidry said his scrutiny of the Opelousas High situation indicates an opponent that is trying to find solutions. \n“They have some athletes; it looks like they are just trying to put it together within a new system,” said Guidry. \nThe Tigers in their first season under head coach Dwight Collins, are playing primarily sophomores and freshmen on both sides of the ball. \nCollins said his team has had some positive moments. Then come the mistakes and bad decisions that have plagued Opelousas all year. \nBoth teams have had quarterback difficulties. \nOpelousas has lost quarterback Hunter LaCroix indefinitely due to a knee issue. The Gators have been shuffling their healthy quarterbacks back and forth all year. \nBeau Chene has used Deontrae Eaglin and the reliable Savion Broussard at quarterback. That leaves a backfield of Charles Williams, Markaylin Milburn and Jylon Henry. \nOpelousas will have freshman Shaun Charles at quarterback if LaCroix isn’t in the lineup. Other potential offensive threats for the Tigers include George Dominick. \nDefensively Guidry likes Opelousas linebacker Marlon Young. \n“Opelousas High has enough talent to have us worried.,” Guidry said. \nThe Gators won’t throw much, according to Guidry. Beau Chene’s Flex Bone offense likes to keep the ball on the ground and the Gators rarely pass. \nOpelousas has also kept close to the ground. The Tigers’ have had trouble putting offensive drives together and have scored 35 points, an average of less than a touchdown per game. \nRecent Series History \n2014: Beau Chene 23, Opelousas 6 \n2013: Beau Chene 12, Opelousas 8 \n2012: Opelousas 29, Beau Chene 0 \n2011: Beau Chene 39, Opelousas 15 \n2010: Beau Chene 7, Opelousas 0 \n2009: Opelousas 23, Beau Chene 12 Read or Share this story: http://www.dailyworld.com/story/sports/high-school/2015/10/22/ohs-beau-chene-fight-first-district-win/74414244/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:14:45.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
