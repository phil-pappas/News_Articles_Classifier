Rex Ryan is still living a charmed life.\nSunday morning on Fox, he was on the right end of a total Twinkie Munch courtesy of Terry Bradshaw.\nWhile the size of Rex’s tuchis has shrunk, Bradshaw still had plenty of room to plant a few verbal kisses.\nA couple of hours later, as the Bills were stumbling and bumbling their way to a 24-10 loss to the Giants, who were poised for another fourth quarter gag job, Daryl Johnston and Kenny Albert failed to link Ryan to Buffalo’s totally undisciplined play.\nPerhaps the Fox voices forgot about his last few years with the Jets.\nUnder Ryan’s “leadership” Sunday, Buffalo committed 17 penalties, the third most in franchise history.\nThis gave Johnston, the analyst, plenty of time to comment about Ryan’s influence on this “style” of play. It also gave Albert plenty of openings to ask Johnston the following question: Why do Rex Ryan teams routinely play out of control?\nBills linebacker Preston Brown provided a slam dunk set-up after being flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct late in the fourth quarter. “That’s just emotion without discipline and Rex Ryan is not going to be happy with this (Brown’s penalty),” Johnston said. “His team has created a lot of their own issues.”\nNot going to be happy?\nSoon after those words left Johnston’s lips, Fox had a shot of Ryan raging on the sidelines in a place he should not be. Was the coach doing his best Preston Brown imitation? Or had Brown just been mirroring Ryan’s emotional stylings when he engaged in unsportsmanlike conduct?\nNow, with Fox’s camera still on a fuming Ryan we expected Johnston, a Gasbag who usually gets it, to make the connection. Instead he said: “Rex Ryan better watch it. Like some of the players on his team, he’s about to get hit with one (a penalty). He’s outside the coach’s box.”\nLike we said, Rex is still leading a charmed life.\nEven Rex seemed to be buying his own jive after the game, when he talked to the media about the 17 penalties.\n“I guess you guys write the stories, so you’ll write it the way you want to write it,” Ryan said. “The one thing I know for a fact is we’ve got heart. The discipline things, you know I get it. You get 17 penalties, that’s obviously a sign of lack of discipline. I think, though, that’s not the real deal.\n“But, you know, hey, it is a free country. Write what you believe.”\nPerhaps this all has something to do with Ryan’s future. For if the Bills continue down this path, Ryan could find himself in TV sooner than anyone thinks.\nAnd no one wants to rip a colleague-in-waiting, right?\nCBS VERY LUCKY\nNews shows like “Meet The Press” and “Face The Nation” routinely deal with world crisis on Sunday mornings.\nNFL pregame shows took on similar crisis-like tones Sunday while reporting that (Oh My God) Andrew Luck (Oh My God) was going to miss his first game ever (Oh My God) and not play against the Jaguars because of a shoulder injury.\nCoverage of this story, and all the repetitive reports, sucked the air out of these shows. After all, it’s hard producing compelling TV when the subject also includes an oral history of Matt Hasselbeck’s career. Yet there was a huge angle all the “insiders” and “outsiders” and “in betweens” left on the table.\nMike Marsland/WireImage Dan Marino. Enlarge Mike Marsland/WireImage David Hasselhoff. Enlarge Dan Marino (l.) and David Hasselhoff attend Jets vs. Dolphins in London Sunday.\nThe suits at the NFL, who also own and control every word coming out of the NFL Network, and the execs at CBS, were jumping for joy. Holding Luck out of Sunday’s tilt means he’ll likely play on NFLN/CBS’s “Thursday Night Football” against Houston, not exactly a matchup that resonates nationally.\nSunday, Indy was in a small potatoes, regionally televised game.\nWithout Luck’s presence in prime time Thursday, those ratings would head south of Houston.\nNow, with the intrigue attached to Luck coming back (after Indy gutted out a win without him), to match wits with J.J. Watt, maximum eyeballs will show up.\nSee, there’s no business like Luck business.\nOH BROTHER\nOn NFLN’s “GameDayFirst” Brian Billick, who has actually made this show SORT of watchable, gloated about his 2004 Ravens kicking the crap out of Eli in a 2004 Week 14 game.\nBillick claimed he told Ryan, then Baltimore’s defensive coordinator, to call the dogs off. “(I said) Rex I don’t want to call Archie and Olivia Manning and tell them we killed their son,” Billick said. “I said Rex, let’s don’t kill this kid. Rex still didn’t back off.”\nAnd the Giants have been getting even ever since.\nPRACTICE, PRACTICE\nWonder who spent more time standing in front of a mirror rehearsing lines designed specifically for a particular moment Sunday.\nWas it Ian (The Bird) Eagle on CBS who, moments after the Jets beat Miami 24-17, said: “There was no Jet lag in London.”\nOr was it ESPN’s Trey Wingo, who opened “Sunday NFL Insiders,” saying: “It looks like they ran out of luck with Luck out in Indy.”\nWow, incredible stuff. And we bet they actually write their own material.\nTROUBLE AT BIG HOUSE\nWhen it comes to allowing viewers into their personal lives, no pregame show does it better than Fox’s “NFL Sunday.”\nNow, we ain’t saying Mike Strahan gets into details of his divorces, but last week, Bradshaw copped to taking the wrong meds before the show started. That became evident when his performance could best be described as semi-coherent (and that’s being kind).\nThen on Sunday, Strahan, cryptically, insinuated host Curt (Big House) Menefee was having some problems at home. A couple of minutes after Strahan’s “revelation,” Menefee addressed it.\n“So I don’t have trouble at home (with my wife), I DON’T have trouble at home — Michael,” Menefee said. “I just want to make sure everybody knows that right now.”\nOkay. Perhaps the snoops from the Daily News’ “Confidential” column might want to look into this matter.\nTOO MUCH TIME\nYou know CBSSN’s “Tops” needs to be cut down from four to two hours when London Fletcher has time to do an extended riff on the person who stole his brand new bike when he was 10 years old. Fletcher: “If I EVER find out who stole my bike it is on.” Riveting TV…..We are confused. Was NFLN’s Mike Robinson’s spot with Tyrod Taylor an interview or a tribute to the Bills QB? Reality tells us it was a waste of time……Check out this fascinating conversation: NFLN’s Melissa Stark asked Billick if he has “a selfie stick.” Billick: “Yeah, but I use it for something else.” Stark: “We’re not going there.” Guess she knows what he uses it for….Shaun O’Hara summed up the state of the NFL in one line on NFLN saying: “Ryan Mathews is running like he wants to get paid. DeMarco Murray is running like he already got paid.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:17:47.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
