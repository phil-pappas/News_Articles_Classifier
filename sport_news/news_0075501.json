Puskar) By   (0) Comments \nNEW YORK (AP) - The Chicago Cubs' return to the playoffs has drawn the largest television audience in the short history of baseball's wild-card game. \nThe Cubs' 4-0 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Wednesday night in the NL wild-card game on TBS averaged 8.3 million viewers, topping the previous high of 7.6 million set a night earlier for the Astros' win over the Yankees in the AL game on ESPN. \nThe viewership is up 48 percent from the 5.6 million for last year's NL game between the Giants and Pirates on ESPN and 60 percent from the 5.2 million for the AL game on TBS between small-market Kansas City and Oakland. \nIt's the most for a Major League Baseball game on cable since the 2011 NL Division Series between the Cardinals and Phillies. \nBaseball added the wild-card round in 2012.
