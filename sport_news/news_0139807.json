(Mike Mulholland | MLive.com) Comments \nPISCATAWAY, N.J. â€” Michigan State true freshman tailback LJ Scott admits he doesn't know exactly what to expect from this week of practice and next Saturday's game at Michigan. \n\"The fact that I'm a freshman, I don't really know how things are, how things are with Michigan and Michigan State,'' said the 6-foot, 233-pound Scott. \"I know it's a big rivalry, and I know there's going to be some hate out there, but I'm just trying to be a piece to the puzzle and help the team out and get the 'W,' \" \nThe No. 4-ranked Spartans (6-0, 2-0 Big Ten) play at No. 18 Michigan (5-1, 2-0) at 3:30 p.m. on Saturday in Ann Arbor. \nScott figures to be the starting tailback as Michigan State looks to win its 10th straight football game and capture a seventh win in the last eight meetings with the Wolverines. \nMSU coach Mark Dantonio was holding Scott out of the game at Rutgers on Saturday night on account of him missing practices due to a mild knee injury. \nBut when starting tailback Madre London went down with an injury with 9:45 left in the third quarter, Scott was pressed into action, ultimately scoring the game-winning touchdown in the 31-24 victory with 43 seconds left. \nScott's first carry of the night came two plays after London was helped off the field, and Scott burst into the end zone for a 1-yard touchdown that put the Spartans on top, 17-14. \n\"I was just trying to stay ready at all times and cheer on my team for the first half,\" Scott said. \"I had just gotten a little banged up and missed some practice time.\" \nSophomore Gerald Holmes saw action ahead of Scott on Saturday, finishing with 37 yards on five carries including a 30-yard run. \nJunior tailback Delton Williams also saw his first playing time of the season, getting two carries for 6 yards. \nBut it was Scott on the field with the game on the line, and he responded by picking up a blitzer on Connor Cook's pivotal 29-yard, third-down completion to R.J. Shelton on the game-winning drive. \nScott came through with an edge block on the next third down play in the series, helping to spring Aaron Burbridge for a 10-yard gain on an end around on a third-and-2 from the Rutgers 38. \nScott closed the game out from there, gaining 9 yards on the next play, and then after being stopped for no gain, getting a corner for 16 yards and then bulling for the 3-yard touchdown that lifted MSU to the win. \nDantonio admitted he was preparing to set up for a potential game-winning field goal on the drive, making sure to center the ball on one play, but Scott had other plans. \n\"I was thinking touchdown, it just happens,\" Scott said. \"Once you get me the ball, I try to do big things and help the team out. \n\"I'm still trying to get better each day and take more in mentally. Stuff is starting to get a little easier.\" \nThis week, however, will not be easier. \nMichigan recorded its third straight shutout on Saturday, beating Northwestern 38-0, and the Wolverines entered the day ranked in the nation's top 10 in scoring defense, rushing defense, passing defense and total defense. \nScott admits he grew up an Ohio State fan, but he didn't say much about how he viewed Michigan as a rival. \n\"Like Coach D said, there isn't much to say,\" Scott said. \"When that time comes, you'll know it's here.\" \nScott is MSU's leading rusher this season with 70 carries for 418 yards and six touchdowns.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T14:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:43:30.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
