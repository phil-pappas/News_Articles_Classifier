Lourdes opened the season with a two-point win over Diller-Odell, then had a bye week before dismissing Friend, in a road game, and Sterling and Omaha Christian, in home clashes. The start has virtually assured the Knights’ inclusion in the 2015 playoffs. Lourdes qualified for the playoffs last year and lost in the first round at Heartland. Lourdes enters tonight’s game as the favorite and many are pointing to the East Butler game on Oct. 22 as the biggest challenge of the Knights’ season. Coach Andy Fedoris won’t be taking this one for granted, however. McCool Junction doesn’t have a win this year, but Fedoris said the Knights’ foe has players with imposing size and will present challenges. The drive might end up being the biggest challenge. Lourdes plans to leave at 3 p.m. today for the journey.The Knights will arrive at 5 p.m., stretch their legs, then get geared up and get ready for the contest. “It’s kind of like a playoff game for us,” said Coach Fedoris. “It’s two hours of our life driving there, we might as well go all out when we get there, have some fun while we are there, and make that two hour trip home a little bit easier.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:48:53.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
