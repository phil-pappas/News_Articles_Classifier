The MC had announced during a massive rally on October 2 that the use of polythene bags would be banned completely in the town from October 10. However, nothing has changed so far, and piles of polythene bags with garbage could be seen in the town. The MC had also decided to levy a hefty penalty on shopkeepers and residents found using polythene bags to carry things but the situation in the town belies this claim. Polythene bags can be seen lying at Gun Hill and on Camelâ€™s Back Road and shopkeepers in most of the markets can be seen selling things in polythene bags without any fear of the administration. MC Health Officer Dr RK Singh said they had not started penalising the offenders but would start a campaign soon to ensure the ban on polythene bags is implemented in the town earnestly. MC employees found guilty of dereliction of duty in disposing of garbage littered in various areas of the town would be punished, he added. Environmentalists have also resented the lackadaisical attitude of the MC for its failure to streamline the segregation and disposal of garbage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:16:56.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
