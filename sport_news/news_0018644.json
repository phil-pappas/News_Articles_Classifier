Or blowing off practice. Or missing any film work or optional workouts. \nIt’s a good trait to have in your best player. And a 50-mph serve doesn’t hurt, either. \n“She doesn’t settle for second-best in anything,” Stokes said of the 5-foot-11 sophomore from the St. Louis area. “She’s the epitome of what you want in a student-athlete.” \nIt was only a little more than a year ago when Johnson rolled into town, carrying with her the label as the most highly touted high school player to ever sign with Missouri State’s volleyball program. \nShe was named a high school All-American by two different organizations as a senior, and the Missouri Gatorade Player of the Year after helping lead Lafayette High School to three state championships. \nSince arriving on campus, it’s clear she has lived up to expectations. Johnson helped lead the Bears to a 20-12 finish as a freshman, being named Missouri Valley Conference Freshman of the Year and to the All-MVC first team. She was an honorable mention All-America pick by the American Volleyball Coaches Association, the first MSU freshman to earn such honors. \nThis season has been more of the same. Johnson has been named MVC Player of the Week, the league’s Defensive Player of the Week, and twice collected MVC Scholar-Athlete of the Week recognition. \n“She deserves all the accolades she gets, because she puts in the time in the classroom, on the court and really with everything she does in her life,” Stokes said. “She does it all to the best of her ability, and is just a great person.” \nIt may be her work in the classroom that is most impressive. Despite missing regular class time when the volleyball team is on the road, Johnson has compiled a 3.98 GPA as she works toward a career in the medical field as a cell and molecular biology major. \n“You just have to stay dedicated and diligent and realize that, yeah, I’m here to play volleyball, but school ultimately takes the greatest priority here, so you’ve just got to get it done,” Johnson said. \nJohnson and the Bears will be back home this weekend, hosting Loyola on Friday and Bradley on Saturday at Hammons Student Center. MSU has seven of its remaining 12 matches at home, then will host the Valley Tournament on Nov. 26-28. \nThe top six teams in the Valley qualify for the league tournament, and the Bears are tied with Southern Illinois for third place, with a 4-2 league mark, one game behind 5-1 Loyola and Wichita State. One of the big early season victories for MSU was a win over perennial power Wichita State on the road. \nIn the RPI released on Monday, Missouri State sits at No. 39, the highest ranking of any Valley team. \n“Being able to claim that victory over Wichita was huge, especially with it being at their place,” Johnson said. “Every opponent you go up against is going to be formidable in their own way. I think we’re really confident in our whole group. \n“I think our chemistry on and off the court is really great, and I think that plays in our favor.” \nThat chemistry helped Johnson play a key role, even as a freshman, on this team. \nShe picked Missouri State over Missouri and Creighton, largely because of the family atmosphere in the program, in addition to the run of success the Bears have had under Stokes, and being close enough for her family to watch her play in person – her parents have missed two matches so far in her career. \nWhen Johnson came on board and quickly took her position as a starter and six-rotation player – she is one of the rare players who never leaves the court – it would have been easy for upperclassmen to be resentful of a young player taking so much playing time. \nBut that never happened. \n“We go by the mindset of ‘Team Before I’ and ‘You Before Me,’ “ Johnson said. “That’s one of the principles that we talk through at the beginning of the year. I think that really shines through with all that we do and every match that we play. \n“Everyone understands that at the end of the day, we’re here to win matches. And whoever is going to be on the floor to get that done, that’s who we want out there.” \nYou don’t need to see much to realize why Johnson needs to be out there for the Bears to be successful. \nShe has 334 kills in 19 matches, easily tops on the team and best in the Valley, and she has 16 career 20-kill matches, third-best in MSU history. \nProbably more impressive is her serve. She employs a top spin jump serve that she can place anywhere on the court. Stokes said it’s typical to see service aces when those types of serves reach 40-42 mph, and Johnson regularly exceeds 50 mph with her deliveries. \nThe coach said it is pretty regular for Johnson to make a play that makes her take a second to process it. Something of a “wow” moment. \n“Sometimes she’ll come up with an amazing shot and get a kill or get the other team out of system where you’re kind of like, ‘That was a pretty impressive shot.’ “ Stokes said. “Or she’ll see the court, the team’s defense on the other side and she’ll drop in a tip that you didn’t expect her to see.” \nEven with the level of play Johnson has risen to over the last year and a half, her coach said she’s not at her ceiling. There’s plenty of room for improvement … which may be a frightening prospect for the rest of the Valley. \n“I definitely think she’s got some room to get better, and she knows that,” Stokes said. “We’re going to see a lot more teams doubling up on her, tripling up on her. It’s going to make it more challenging for her to score, and she’s done a phenomenal job. \n“We can’t expect her to be phenomenal every single night of the week, but she’s been doing an incredible job and carries a very big load for us.” \nMissouri State volleyball \nWhen: 7 p.m. Friday vs. Loyola (ESPN3), 7 p.m. Saturday vs. Bradley \nWhere: Hammons Student Center \nPromotions: It’s Dig Pink weekend, where volleyball programs partner with the Side-Out Foundation for breast cancer awareness.
