Carty said Amankwaa nearly tripped, but he regained balance to give the Raiders a 15-6 lead with Zachary Eilbacher's extra point making it 16-6. The Raiders went on to win 29-18 to keep their drive to make the Central Group V playoffs alive. \n\"It was an awesome play and it was nice to have some breathing room,\" Carty said. \nThe big return Amankwaa's second of the season. He returned an interception 50 yards for a score in the 42-0 win at Hunterdon Central. \n\"He's becoming a real player for us and he's really just learning how to play the game,'' said Carty, pointing out sophomore defensive back \nCharles Amankwaa is David's brother. The Amankwaa's, Ryan Melillo and Luke Jansen make up the team's secondary. \nThe Raiders (2-4) moved into seventh in the sectional field one spot ahead of Edison (2-3). The Raiders play host to Elizabeth (4-2) Friday night with the Minutemen out to bounce back from a 31-0 loss at Phillipsburg and fortify their spot in the North 2 Group V field. \nOTHER NOTABLE PLAYERS: \nWestfield senior back Jack Curry ran for 216 yards and four touchdowns on 38 carries in the Blue Devils 34-6 rout of Westfield in a battle of Mid State-38 Watchung Division unbeatens. Westfield is 5-0. \nMontgomery senior Mitch Chugunov caught nine passes for 146 yards and two touchdowns in a 26-6 win over Scotch Plains-Fanwood. \nRidge senior back Kermit Hoffman ran for 114 yards and three touchdowns on 17 carries and caught four passes for 68 yards in a wild 43-32 win over Plainfield in Bernards. \nSomerville's Jeremiah Lynch caught an 81-yard touchdown pass from QB Mike Tarver, returned a kick 82 yards for a score and added a two point conversion run in a 26-20 victory over Summit.
