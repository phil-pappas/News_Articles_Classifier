Junior goalkeeper Colin Webb had his busiest shift in goal this season, making six saves during the game to deny Maryland, who had scored in five straight games prior to Friday.\nIU, which spent additional time on finishing in training during the past week, came close to scoring in the 10th minute when junior defender Billy McConnell’s shot hit the post.\nTwice Niedermeier denied junior midfielder Tanner Thompson, who had five attempts on goal. Redshirt junior midfielder Phil Fives also tested Niedermeier twice during the game but was also unable to find a way past him.\n“I thought it was a good game, I thought Maryland was excellent and was very good going forward, and I thought our team defense was very good,” IU Coach Todd Yeagley said. “It was a game where both teams were trying to establish territory and rhythm and so it’s a high paced game, and I thought we could have been a little bit better with in our poise in the final third.”\nThe draw means the Hoosiers are still at the bottom of the Big Ten standings and will return to Bill Armstrong Stadium on Tuesday night as they prepare to face Louisville in non-conference action.\nLionel Lim", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:42:35.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
