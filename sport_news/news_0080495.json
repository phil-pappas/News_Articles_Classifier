But the unlucky streak would continue after quarterback Kody Kegarise was picked off by Cocalico's DJ Fabiani inside the 5-yard-line with thirty-five seconds remaining. \nThen the tide began to turn. \nWith 1:11 left in the third quarter, Barons' defensive back Drew Eshleman picked of Haines near midfield and returned it to the Eagles 29-yard-line. \nThe Barons ultimately were able to punch it in with Camacho from the 1-yard-line to make it a two-point game. \n\"In the first half, we were kind of soft and messing up on our keys. At halftime, coach gave us a talk about tradition and not letting our former players down and we picked it up,\" Camacho said. \nThen to add a little flair, the Barons pulled off a reverse pass to Kegarise to convert on their two-point attempt and tie the game. \n\"I was a little bit scared to run it. We practiced it earlier in the year but we didn't practice it this week so I was a little scared to run it but I got a little encouragement that we should,\" Hahn said. \"I told the kids that if we scored, we were going for two to get back in the game. I didn't want to be down 15-14 because then we'd start pressing.\" \nAfter another key defensive stop, the Barons offense finished the job with 4:57 remaining when Camacho took a handoff 20 yards to the house to put his team up 21-15 (conversion no good). \nCamacho led all rushers with 155 yards in addition to his three touchdowns. \n\"Damon is a great athlete and a great player for us but if he doesn't have Sam Martin (TE), DaShuan Neville (OL), Adam Kline (OL), he's not as good.\" \nBut it wouldn't be a Cocalico/Manheim Central game without a little drama at the end. \nHaines and the Eagles drove down the field in hopes of a game-winning touchdown/extra point and got inside the Barons 15-yard-line. \nHowever the Barons defense would make one more stand and forced an incomplete pass on fourth-and-five. \n\"I thought our pass protection was OK but they just had everything covered,\" Eagle coach Dave Gingrich said \"We thought we had a good play called and they covered it well.\" \nThe win keeps the Barons within one game of first place Solanco (8-0, 5-0) with a Week 10 head-to-head matchup looming but must take care of Garden Spot next week. \n\"It's important for us to get this win and to shake the loss from last week (L-S). We are battling a lot of injuries as were doubting ourselves. To get it is huge.\" \nMeanwhile, Cocalico drops to 3-2 in the Section Two race and has a date with the Golden Mules next week. \n\"It should hurt. Nothing I'm going to say tonight is going to make it feel any better. I'd be disappointed if they weren't upset tonight,\" Gingrich said. \n\"We all should be. I am. We'll wake up tomorrow and we'll get right back on it and start to get ready for Solanco.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T18:44:48.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
