He added another 85 yards and a score on the ground. Dungey is a springy athlete who isn’t bashful about using his feet — or leaving them, if he elects — to pick up extra yardage. \nUnfortunately for the Orange, this leaves the promising signal caller exposed far more often than it would like. Dungey ran the ball 17 times against South Florida and 18 times against Virginia after sitting out Week 4 following a helmet-to-helmet hit against Central Michigan . \nSyracuse uses Dungey exclusively in the shotgun and pistol formations in order to best utilize his legs and option skills. But this leads to an inordinate amount of contact. He was sacked three times on Saturday, and the Cavaliers connected on helmet-to-helmet hits twice on Dungey — including on his eye-popping 26-yard touchdown run where he hurdled All-ACC safety Quin Blanding into the end zone . \nStephen Bailey of Syracuse.com counted 20 hits on Dungey during the game , including nine hits Dungey failed to avoid. Dungey was hit on 30.8 percent of the team’s 65 plays. Offensive coordinator Tim Lester, a standout quarterback at Western Michigan, said all he can do is continue teaching Dungey how to protect himself. \n“He did go from 46 to 84 percent (success) on run reads,” Lester said. “But I called 32 pass plays and he only threw 22 times. So that needs to change.” \nLester said Dungey made three great throws under pressure against Virginia, including an 18-yard pass to Steve Ishmael and a touchdown pass to Erv Philips. But Lester also said Dungey took three sacks on Saturday because he held onto the ball too long. \n“I know it’s been a big topic,” said head coach Scott Shafer. “We’re trying to teach him to get rid of the ball in certain situations. And, with that being said, to let him play to his strengths. So there’s a fine line there. Just trying to win every game and also teach the kid how to protect himself as well.” \nLester told the media on Tuesday that Dungey’s hurdle touchdown was on a stick draw. Virginia dropped back in coverage and Dungey scrambled into an opening. The Orange ran that play five times on Saturday, including on the touchdown pass to Philips . Dungey is currently 10th in the country in passing efficiency. \n“He’s got a really high efficiency rating, but his yards per completion is huge, and that’s really high,” Shafer said. “Almost 14 yards per completion, those are real throws. That’s not one of those offenses where a guy has a high completion percentage but 20 percent of his throws are behind the line of scrimmage.” \nNASSIB’S BROTHER LEADS NCAA \nFormer Orange quarterback Ryan Nassib’s younger brother Carl is the talk of college football — piling up 11.5 sacks, 15.5 tackles for a loss and five forced fumbles at defensive end for Penn State. \nNassib didn’t have a career start in high school or college before this season, but the former walk-on now leads the country in three major categories and was named to ESPN.com’s midseason All-America team . The Nassib family resides in West Chester, Pa., so the decision for Carl to begin his college football career at State College makes sense. But did the Orange have a chance to get him? \nThe answer is yes, Scott Shafer explained on Thursday, but the player Carl Nassib has become is nothing like the stringbean prospect he was out of high school. \n“He came to camp, and we were probably just like Penn State,” Shafer said. “We felt like he was a little ways away — that he was still developing. He’s a long bodied guy still growing into his body. \n“Our numbers weren’t in a position to pass an offer to him so we tried to get him to walk-on. And he chose (Shafer stopped to grit his teeth) Penn State.” \nNassib, now a redshirt senior, entered Penn State at 218 pounds. He has since bulked up to 275 pounds, evolving from a scout-teamer to one of the top defensive ends in the country. \n“People work hard for a while and expect results to come out like that,” Nassib told ESPN. “And it’s difficult to work hard every day for long periods of time and not really see the fruits of your labor until later in life. But those are the really lucky people that strive to be the best they can be and, one day, they look at themselves and they are.” \nShafer might not like that Nassib is making a world of difference for Syracuse’s famous rival, but after coaching Ryan between 2009-13 and helping him get to the NFL, the coach is elated for the family’s continued success. \n“I’m just happy for him,” Shafer said. “The Nassib family, they’re the best. He’s doing a great job over there.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T01:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:56:09.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
