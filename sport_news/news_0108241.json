Los Angeles County prosecutors will not file felony charges against a Saudi prince — citing a lack of evidence implicating Majed Abdulaziz Al-Saud of sexually assaulting a woman, according to a local report.\nThe case is now with the city’s prosecutors to file misdemeanor charges after the 29-year-old prince’s arrest at a raucous Beverly Hills party the night of Sept. 23.\nA woman accused Al—Saud of trying to force her to perform oral sex on him at a mansion he rented, leading three anonymous women to come forward in a civil lawsuit with additional claims of their own, according to the Los Angeles Times .\n“The decision by the D.A.’s office not to file charges shows that the accuser’s stories cannot be substantiated. The sheik is very happy to put it behind him and move on with his life,” Al-Saud’s attorney, Alan Jackson, said in a statement to the Times.\nPolice were called to the 22,000-square-foot property when a neighbor allegedly saw a terrified woman scaling a fence to safety. He was detained for several hours after authorities interviewed several people at the home, but later released on a $300,000 bail.\nHe had been arrested on a charge of forced oral copulation.\nnhensley@nydailynews.com", "external_links": ["http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-saudi-prince-beverly-hills-20151019-story.html"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:49:06.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
