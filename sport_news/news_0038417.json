As he made his way through the crowd, one man put his arm around Collins, pulled him close and said, “I love you” before planting a serious kiss on the 66-year-old’s cheek.\nCollins — managing in his first postseason — gave Mets fans plenty of reasons to “love” him as all his in-game gambles and maneuvers played out exactly as he hope. \nMets fan plants one on Terry Collins. Tells him \"I love you.\"' pic.twitter.com/v5OTBWhBIq \n— Jimmy Traina (@JimmyTraina) October 16, 2015 \n\nHe stuck with starter Jacob deGrom after the young righty was hit hard and allowed two runs in the opening inning, and DeGrom didn’t surrender another run in his six innings of work. He allowed six hits and struck out seven. Noah Syndergaard tossed a scoreless seventh and Jeurys Familia, who ended up batting in the top of the ninth, recorded two perfect frames to earn the save.\nMets fans weren’t always this happy with Collins and his handling of pitchers, especially his use of Bobby Parnell as the team tried to clinch the division title. \nMany times during his five-year tenure they called for former Mets second baseman Wally Backman to take over as the club suffered through four losing seasons. Amazin’ fans also were frustrated when they saw home field advantage slip away in the closing weeks this year as Collins rested starters and tried Jonathan Niese out of the bullpen.\nAll of that was forgotten with the team now as Collins has the Mets four wins away from its first World Series appearance since 2000. \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  terry collins", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:12:56.362+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
