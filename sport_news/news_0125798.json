It will also have off-line capabilities and special features. \nDisney signed a new agreement with YouTube, which will ensure that select Disney content is available on YouTube Red, according to a YouTube spokesperson. \nAlthough Disney is ESPN's parent company, ESPN hasn't been able to join the subscription side of YouTube because of rights and legal issues with various sports leagues. \nOnce YouTube Red goes live in the U.S. on October 28, companies that have not agreed to its terms will have their content blocked on the regular YouTube site. \nBecause ESPN was unable to join YouTube Red it was forced to remove its videos from YouTube. \nSpokespeople from ESPN and YouTube could not comment on whether ESPN would eventually be part of the subscription-based service. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T05:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:56:23.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
