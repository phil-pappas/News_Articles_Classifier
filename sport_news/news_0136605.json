The victim said when approached the pair, they began to yell obscenities at him. Police said seconds later, the older boy pulled a pistol from his waistband and threatened to shoot the victim if he didnâ€™t leave them alone.\nDuring the course of the investigation, officers saw the pair in the 3000 block of Chartres Street. The juveniles were apprehended without incident. The victim arrived on the scene a short time later and made a positive identification on both suspects.\nThe young pair was booked into the Juvenile Division for aggravated assault and illegal possession of a firearm by a juvenile. The 6-year-old's charges were entered at the Juvenile Division under the state statute as a form of data collection, police said. Police said he is not at the age of culpability - 10 years, under state law - to be arrested, but he still had to be processed. He was then released to a legal guardian.\nThe Eighth District Investigation Unit in conjunction with the Juvenile Division is in charge of the ongoing investigation.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
