Every game. \nThe Bears take to the road this weekend against Lamar after a 28-13 home defeat to McNeese State in which they had a 13-7 lead going into the fourth quarter. After Lamar, UCA, which dropped to 3-3, 2-2 in the Southland, has three of its next four games at home (Southeastern Louisiana, Stephen F. Austin and Sam Houston State). \n“We have our destiny in our hands,” said Campbell at Monday’s weekly Bearbacker luncheon. “As far as the NCAA playoffs, if we take care of business, one week at a time, we’ll be in the NCAA playoffs (with a possible 8-3 mark). After our last loss (Oklahoma State), we got a lot better. And McNeese State is a championship football team.” \nAgainst the undefeated on Saturday, the Bears held a 13-7 lead and seemed to have the Cowboys on their heels and were driving when a snap bounced off the leg of Jatavious Wilson into the hands of Wallace Scott for a scoop and score. \nMcNeese took advantage of field position and a turnover to tack on two more touchdowns. \nIn addition to the defensive touchdown, the Cowboys drove 46 and 16 yards for the final two scores. The Cowboys managed only 160 yards of offense on 61 plays for the game. \n“For three quarters, we played them exactly like we want to play them,” Campbell said. “We executed our game plan. But you can’t make mistakes after a football team that good.” INJURIES \nThe Bears came out of the physical contest with some injuries but Campbell expects a full crew for the Lamar game. He said quarterback Hayden Hildebrand re-inured his left should but is better abnd will start. “He will have problems with that shoulder the rest of the year each time he is hit on it and aggravates it,” Campbell said. \nWilson injured an ankle but he is expected to be recovered for Saturday. \nSenior quarterback Taylor Reed, who injured a shoulder against Nortwestern State, dressed out for the first time since that game Saturday and he is expected to return to the lineup within the next few weeks. \n“We’ve played six games and it’s a physical game, so you are going to have bumps and bruises,” Campbell said. “Our guys are doing a good job of knowing the difference between being hurt and being injured.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:26:39.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
