Photograph by: DARRYL DYCK , THE CANADIAN PRESS \nThe Saskatchewan Roughriders have gone from a parade to a charade. \nGrey Cup champions in 2013, the Roughriders have now descended to the point where they pretend to have a chance of making the CFL playoffs, when in actuality all realistic hopes evaporated more than a month ago. \nFalling 46-20 to the host B.C. Lions, as the 2-12 Roughriders did on Saturday, is embarrassing enough. But, establishing that there is delusion to complement the confusion, the Roughriders keep clinging to the faintest of hopes after a game in which they trailed 40-5 at three-quarter time. \nTake a knee. \nTake an Advil. \nFans, take solace in the fact that the Toronto Blue Jays are preparing for the playoffs, Connor McDavid is poised to make his NHL regular-season debut, and the athletic calendar is so jam-packed that this is the best time of year to be a sports fan — if not necessarily a supporter of the Riders, given recent misadventures. \nTake anything the Roughriders say with a grain of salt, because their actions do not correlate with their words. \nSupposedly playing to win, and with desperation, the Easy Riders were eviscerated by a team that is virtually guaranteed to lose unless it has the extreme good fortune to discover that (whew!) Saskatchewan is next on the schedule. \nThe Lions have won only five times this season, with three of the victories coming at Saskatchewan’s expense. \nMost recently, the Lions won despite starting rookie quarterback Jonathon Jennings — only a few weeks removed from being a third-stringer — against a Saskatchewan team that countered with veteran Kevin Glenn because, we were assured, he gives the Roughriders the best chance to win. \nGlenn fumbled away the ball on Saskatchewan’s opening possession. \nFor variety, he threw an interception the second time Saskatchewan had the ball. \nThe vaunted Worst Coast Offence proceeded to erupt for three consecutive two-and-outs — on such a night, a punt constituted a breakthrough — en route to becoming a one-and-out proposition. \nOne more loss in the Roughriders’ final four regular-season games and they are officially, relievedly sunk. Even if the Roughriders can miraculously run the table, they will need an extraordinary amount of help from other teams. \nAny dreamer who clings to the notion that the Roughriders retain even a scintilla of a chance of making the playoffs — regardless of the mathematics — might also want to believe in the Easter Bunny, Santa Claus, and most politicians’ campaign promises. \nPerhaps the Roughriders should endorse the Liberals, being that Justin Trudeau’s platform prescribes a deficit. Surely, the Roughriders can relate to that after being sliced and diced for a season-high 46 points on Saturday. \nImpressive feat, that. A team which has the CFL’s worst defence has somehow reached a new low. \nThis occurred against a quarterback who was making only his second pro start. Even so, Jennings looked like Warren Moon, throwing four touchdown passes and, for good measure, hauling in a 21-yard scoring toss from receiver Austin Collie. \nYes, it is true. A Lions receiver threw a touchdown pass before a Saskatchewan quarterback on Saturday. \nHow sad is this? \nWhat’s that? An entire month remains before the merciful conclusion of this sorry season? \nOh, lovely. \nMore of this “we still have a chance” sedative. \nMore realistically, the Roughriders have a chance of setting a franchise single-season record for losses, with 16. \nThey have a chance of becoming irrelevant by Thanksgiving weekend, despite leading the CFL in revenues and, evidently, empty sentences. \nThey have everything but a plan, it seems. \nWith four obligatory games on the regular-season schedule, the Roughriders still do not intend to hand over the starting quarterback’s reins to 23-year-old Brett Smith. \nThat is the prevailing mindset even though player development should be the priority if anything is to be salvaged from the league-mandated games that remain — the first of which is Friday’s road date with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. \nInstead, the 36-year-old Glenn will continue to start for a team that is, for anyone who has even a tenuous grasp of reality, finished.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:55:09.099+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
