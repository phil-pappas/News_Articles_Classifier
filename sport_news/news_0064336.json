The striker netted a header to equalize in the 62nd minute, before tapping home from an Adrian Winter feed in the 70th minute. The brace took his tally to 17 goals for the season, which has long since smashed the previous rookie goal-scoring record of 11.\nWith the win, Orlando City pulled to within one point of Montreal for the sixth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. Montreal has two games left in the season, while Orlando now has one game remaining.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:23:41.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
