He was 13. (Source: KEYE via CNN) \nAUSTIN, TX (KEYE/CNN) - University of Texas mascot Bevo XIV has died. \nThe Texas Longhorn steer was diagnosed bovine leukemia last week and died Friday at a ranch with his predecessor, Bevo XIII, nearby. \nBevo XIV was 13 years old and began his tenure as the Longhorns' live mascot in 2004 at 2 years old. He also made an appearance at the second inauguration of President George W. Bush. \nThe university said the search for the next mascot, to be named Bevo XV, will begin immediately. \nTributes to the famous cow have poured in from a variety of places, including Texas' bitter rival Texas A&M, which tweeted a picture of Bevo with its own live mascot, a collie named Reveille. Condolences to @UTAustin on the passing of @BEVO_XIV . Mascots are truly special. ???? pic.twitter.com/0S3BBmwbr3 â€” Texas A&M University (@TAMU) October 16, 2015 \nCopyright 2015 KEYE via CNN.
