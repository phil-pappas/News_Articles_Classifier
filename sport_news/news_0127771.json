Hoiberg said Rose is set to return to the team on Wednesday morning.\nFrom the Chicago Sun-Times : “[The Friday] follow-up went very well,’’ Hoiberg said. “They’ve advised him to continue to let that sight heal, and they think the best way for him to do that is to stay at home at this time. We plan on him being back on Wednesday morning.’’\nHoiberg went on to say: “It doesn’t change the [two-week timetable for Rose’s return]. Everything is the same on that. And then after those two weeks he should be able to resume full activity.”\nRose turned 27 on Sunday.\nHappy Birthday @drose ! pic.twitter.com/ENRv46JLtW\n— Chicago Bulls (@chicagobulls) October 4, 2015", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/chicagobulls/status/650675824866234368", "https://twitter.com/drose", "http://t.co/ENRv46JLtW"], "published": "2015-10-05T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:04:06.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
