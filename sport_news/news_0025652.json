On our end we did something we hadn’t done all year, we double man marked. We played a 3-3-2 with a double man mark on their strikers and it worked for the most part.” \nThe Blackhawks (3-14-0) had some scheduling conflicts with players as well as some injuries and were only able to dress 15 players. That paired with some calls that went against Fort, like Wilke’s penalty kick in the first half, it was too much to overcome for Fort. \nFreshman Javi Meza helped put Fort on the board, forcing an own goal with a good play down the wing, cutting the ball back and taking a shot before a poor clearance from a Lake Mills’ defender put the ball in the net in the first half. \nFort wraps up the regular season this week, taking on Monroe on the road on Tuesday before heading home on Thursday to face Hartford. Tuesday’s game is at 5 p.m. while Thursday’s will be played at 7 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:08:59.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
