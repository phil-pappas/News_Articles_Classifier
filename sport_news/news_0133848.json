Cal plays at UCLA a week from Thursday. \nDykes met individually with several players the past couple days and said everyone understands the game was a missed opportunity. He has no concerns about the psyche of quarterback Jared Goff, who threw a career-high five interceptions. \n\"His state of mind's fine,\" Dykes said. \"He's disappointed. His performance wasn't indicative of the kind of player he is. \n\"Kenny Lawler feels the same way,\" Dykes said of the Bears' standout receiver. \"Kenny's dropped a couple balls the last couple weeks. He's ready to get back out there in practice and makes sure it doesn't happen again.\" \nThe one player who needs an emotional boost at this point, Dykes said, is senior running back Daniel Lasco, who has barely played the past four weeks after injuring his hip. Lasco was expected to be ready against Utah, but fumbled on his first carry and did not see any further action on offense, although he was on the field for special teams.

Might get him a little bit of live action this week, let him get tackled, which I think is important for running backs to do some. Just get back in the flow of it.\" \nAn 1,100-yard rusher last season, Lasco actually returned from the injury more quickly than his coach expected. \n\"I think in some ways it probably hurt is confidence a little bit before he was completely healthy,\" Dykes said. \"He's the ultimate team player. He wanted to get back and help our football team as quickly as he could. \n\"He just hasn't been himself. That position is all about playing with confidence and playing fast and being able to see things and read things. He's just not there yet.\" \n-- Senior defensive tackle Mustafa Jalil has sat out two of the past three games with a sore knee, but could get the chance in practice this week to regain a rhythm. \n\"He had little run where he didn't feel good, couldn't move around,\" said Dykes, who otherwise characterized the Bears as fairly healthy.\" \n-- Dykes expressed sadness about both the circumstances that led to Steve Sarkisian being fired by USC and South Carolina coach Steve Spurrier's decision to retire. \nOn Sarkisian, who is reported to be battling an alcohol addiction, Dykes said, \"I hate it for Steve and I hate it for their players and coaches and all the families. That's a hard thing to go through. You just hope he can get well. He's a really bright football coach and he'll have a bright future. It's just a sad thing to go through.\" \nDykes was an assistant at Kentucky in 1997 and '99 when Spurrier was flying high as coach. \n\"He's one of the old guard left in college football and you hate to lose him,\" Dykes said \"He's kind of a larger than life personality. He was great for the game.\" \nBut Dykes isn't sure we've seen the last of Spurrier, now 70. \n\"I wouldn't be surprised if Coach Spurrier ends up coaching somewhere again,\" he said.
