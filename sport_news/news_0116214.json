We'll see next time. Maybe it's better.\" \nCeltic were 2-0 down to Molde inside the first 18 minutes in a game which saw former Manchester United favorite Ole Gunnar Solskjaer take over for a second spell in charge of the Norwegian side. \nMohamed Elyounoussi made the most of a poor Dedryck Boyata pass before finding Ola Kamara who drove the ball past goalkeeper Craig Gordon after 11 minutes. \nSeven minutes later it was 2-0 thanks to Vegard Forren's left-footed effort. \nKris Commons reduced the deficit in the 55th minute for Celtic but Molde restored their two-goal advantage just a minute later through Elyounoussi. \nFenerbahce recorded their first win in the same Group A thanks to a last minute Fernandao strike against Ajax. \nMolde lead the way with seven points, three ahead of Fenerbahce while Ajax and Celtic have two points each.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T19:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:35:45.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
