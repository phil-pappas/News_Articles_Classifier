By Mike Lowe Staff Writer Read Article 1 of 8 New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady goes over the top for a touchdown against the New York Jets during the first half Sunday in Foxborough, Mass. The Associated Press \nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. — Tom Brady threw two touchdown passes in the fourth quarter as the New England Patriots rallied for a 30-23 victory over the New York Jets at Gillette Stadium Sunday afternoon. \nThe Jets led 17-16 entering the fourth quarter and extended the lead to 20-16 with 12:50 left on a 30-yard field goal by Nick Folk. But that came one play after Brandon Marshall dropped a possible touchdown pass for the Jets. \nSure enough, the Patriots came back and took the lead with 7:16 left when Danny Amendola went up to catch an 8-yard touchdown pass from Brady with 7:16 left, making it 23-20. \nAfter forcing a punt, the Patriots sealed it when Brady threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to a wide-open Rob Gronkowski with 1:13 remaining. Amendola had three key catches on that drive for 31 yards. \nNew England is now 6-0 for the third time in team history, the others being 2004 and 2007. They won the Super Bowl in 2004 and lost in the Super Bowl in 2007. \nThe Jets dropped to 4-2. \nThe Jets took the lead at 17-16 with an impressive drive in the third quarter, scoring on a 9-yard pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick to Chris Ivory, who was uncovered in the right flat. The Jets converted all three third-down opportunities on the drive. \nNew England had a nice drive to start the third, but Julian Edelman dropped a sure touchdown pass, forcing the Patriots to settle for a 24-yard field goal by Stephen Gostkowski. \nNothing came easy for the Patriots in the first half. Even Gostkowski almost had a blip when his PAT kick after New England’s touchdown went in off the right goal post. \nBut New England’s defense, stung for two long scoring drives by the Jets (15 plays, 5:19 on the first one; 14 plays, 7:35 on the second), regrouped and kept the Jets in check the rest of the half. \nThe Patriots offense finally got untracked in the second quarter when Tom Brady scored on a 1-yard sneak with 6:24 left in the second quarter. Brady set up that score with another run, this one an 11-yard scramble. That tied the game at 10. \nThen the defense forced a Jets’ punt and the Patriots took a 13-10 lead on Gostkowski’s 46-yard field goal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:18:04.811+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
