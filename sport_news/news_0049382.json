(AP) - Darrelle Revis switched sides in the rivalry between the Patriots and Jets and helped New England win a Super Bowl in his only season there. \nThen he switched back. \nAgain manning the defensive backfield for New York, where he played the first six years of his career, Revis has helped bolster a defense that is No. 1 in the league. And for Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who has faced Revis in both practice and games, there’s no question which he preferred. \n“He’s been an incredible playmaker since he’s been in the league,” Brady said this week as the Patriots (5-0) prepared for the Jets (4-1). “I got a firsthand look at that last year every day in practice, and it was great to have him play a part here. But he moved on, so now he’s our competition again.” \nRevis made the Pro Bowl four straight years before missing most of the 2012 season with a torn ACL. The Jets traded the cornerback to Tampa Bay that offseason, and after one season with the Buccaneers in which he returned to Pro Bowl form - but won only four games - he signed with the Patriots. \nFor a team that resists big-name and big-money free agents, the signing was a departure - one that paid off. Revis solidified the secondary and helped New England win its fourth championship, intercepting Andrew Luck in the AFC title game and then adding a sack of Russell Wilson in the Super Bowl. \n“When you don’t coach a guy, you don’t just have that day-to-day relationship with him. You just see him the times you compete against him,” Patriots coach Bill Belichick said. “He was a pleasure to coach and really has a great understanding, instinctiveness to the game, studies his opponents well, always well prepared, very professional. Obviously, he’s a great player.” \nNew York and Boston have been rivals for more than a century - not just in football, and not just in sports. But the NFL “border wars” that flared up between Belichick and mentor Bill Parcells had cooled before Rex Ryan took over the Jets. \nStill, he couldn’t make much of a dent in a Patriots reign that has earned them 11 AFC East titles in 12 years. Revis switching sides might not be enough to change that, but with a victory the Jets would tie New England atop the division. \nHere are some more things to look for in Sunday’s game: \nSMALL TALK: Ryan arrived in New York vowing to challenge the Patriots’ supremacy. Though the Jets did reach the conference championship game in back-to-back seasons (2009-10), they only went through the Patriots once and never won a division title. \nUnder new coach Todd Bowles, the Jets have taken a quieter approach. \n“It’s as big as you want it to be,” Revis said. “For us, it’s still early in the season. We’re still trying to get better and better each week. It is a big game because it is a conference game, but at the same time, it’s still early in the season. … Whoever’s on the schedule that week, that’s who we’ve got to play.” \nIVORY SHINES: Jets running back Chris Ivory is off to the best start of his NFL career. \nHe’s coming off his first back-to-back 100 yards rushing performances, and his 312 yards rushing combined over the last two games are the most by a Jets player since Thomas Jones had 331 in 2009.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:58:50.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
