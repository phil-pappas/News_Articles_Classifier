OK?\nArizona State beat UCLA, Southern California beat Arizona State, Stanford beat USC, Northwestern beat Stanford. Get it?\nThe USA TODAY Sports 1-128 Re-rank is supposed to get easier with each week. Instead, it's getting more and more difficult to peg the best teams in college football â€” though it is easy to find the nation's worst, which is New Mexico State, Idaho, Kansas, Georgia State, UTEP and Wyoming, in one order or another.\nFollow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. For now, it's only fair to reward those teams that have remained unbeaten through five weeks. That's why Alabama moves up just one spot to No. 11 despite an extremely impressive win at Georgia. (And the Rebels are No. 10, one ahead of the Crimson Tide, because of the reason listed above.)\nThe Gators storm from outside the top 25 to No. 9. Northwestern, Clemson and Texas A&M join Florida and Jim McElwain inside the top 10.\nNew to the top 25: Florida and Iowa.\nOut of the top 25: Texas Tech and Memphis.\n58 CONNECT 54 TWEET LINKEDIN 3 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read //usat.ly/1LdJnJQ", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/09/03/USATODAY/USATODAY/635768715971618409-football-four-promo2.jpg", "http://footballfour.usatoday.com/", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4531416110001_thumbnail-for-video-4531378785001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LdJnJQ&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/34f3c12e46e775b6bc7e523d797ba40d553715a7/r=540&c=540x304/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4531416111001_video-still-for-video-4531378785001.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/635795999554111013-USATSI-8839222.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/71980614b0a2ffa3bf17db0314c4ef761338e541/c=612-350-3776-2729&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/635795999554111013-USATSI-8839222.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4531416111001_video-still-for-video-4531378785001.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LdJnJQ&text=NCAA%201-128%20Re-rank%20is%20getting%20murkier%20by%20the%20week&via=enquirer", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2015/10/29906170001_4531416111001_video-still-for-video-4531378785001.jpg", "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/sports/ncaaf/2015/10/04/73342438/", "http://imgur.com/BAZzzCJ.png", "http://archive.azcentral.com/ic/news/projects/css/linkset.css", "http://usat.ly/1LcgOwf", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1f602284233b97c28e15b66bbefaf727473a16eb/r=500x349/local/-/media/2015/10/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/635795999554111013-USATSI-8839222.jpg", "http://usat.ly/1LdJnJQ"], "published": "2015-10-05T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:31:21.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
