Anything after that, there's a ton of adjustment, a ton of all those things. That certainly is what has made Mike Leach very successful at what he does and why they do what they do.\" What the Ducks need to do to salvage the season \nHelfrich said bringing pressure in multiple ways will be crucial for the defense. \n\"You have to vary things enough. You have to be standard enough in your own minds, so you play fast and free, and not just constantly thinking about a formation adjustment or a coverage adjustment, whatever that might dictate by coverage,\" Helfrich said. \"And then you have to make the quarterback uncomfortable, whether that's hitting him, pressuring him, confusing him, creating turnovers. Just all those things you have to do to get in their head.\" \nWashington State opened the season with a 24-17 loss at home to Portland State. After that stunner, Leach was on the hot seat. \nThe Cougars responded by beating Rutgers and Wyoming, and after a bye, they almost pulled an upset at California last week, falling 34-28 in Berkeley. \nWashington State almost derailed Oregon's Pac-12 championship last season in Pullman, but the Ducks escaped with a 38-31 victory with Marcus Mariota carrying the team on his way to winning the Heisman Trophy. Helfrich comfortable using two QBs again 'if it makes sense' \nThis season, Washington State will need to prepare for multiple quarterbacks. \nOregon sat graduate transfer quarterback Vernon Adams last week with a broken finger, and played both junior Jeff Lockie and sophomore walkon Taylor Alie. \nHelfrich said Sunday he would be comfortable using multiple quarterbacks again \"if it makes sense.\" \nWashington State ranks ninth in the Pac-12 in points (26.5) and yards (393.5) allowed. \nThe Cougars rank sixth in the conference in rushing defense, allowing 155.8 yards per game. However, they haven't seen a rushing attack like Oregon's yet this season. The Ducks lead the conference, averaging 300.4 rushing yards per game. \nWashington State will try to end a couple streaks on Saturday. The last time the Cougars beat the Ducks was in 2006. And the last time they won at Autzen Stadium was in 2003. \nThose are long droughts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T02:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T06:22:19.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
