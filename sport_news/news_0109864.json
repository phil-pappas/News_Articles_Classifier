The teams traded touchdowns on two of the game's first three drives, but Tennessee (3-4, 1-3 SEC) went until there were less than six minutes remaining in the game to score again. \nA four-play, 75-yard drive that spanned one minute and 15 seconds gave Tennessee a rare lead over Alabama (7-1, 4-1), but the Crimson Tide moved the ball on a tired defense to have the last word once again. \nSeveral times, the Vols looked poised to take the lead or tie the score only to come away with no points. Kicker Aaron Medley continued his disappointing sophomore season by missing a kick from 43 yards out and, twice, from 51 yards away. \nThe 7-7 game stayed that way until halftime, but on the first Alabama drive after the break, quarterback Jake Coker hit his first four passes to bring the Crimson Tide to the Tennessee 1. \nThere, the Vols' defense stood tall, stuffing Henry and then breaking up Coker's third-down pass attempt. \nAlabama settled for a field goal, which allowed the Vols to grab a one-point lead on Jalen Hurd's 12-yard fourth-quarter run. \nBut Henry put the Crimson Tide back on top late, and Alabama held off the Vols on their final possession. \nReach Matt Slovin at mslovin@tennessean.com or on Twitter @MattSlovin.
