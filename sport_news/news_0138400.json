The Sports Quotient 15 hrs ago Ben Tarhan © Jared Wickerham/Getty Images The Chicago Cubs celebrate their NL wild card victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. With the completion of the 2015 AL and NL wild card games on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, the MLB completed its fourth installment of the winner-take-all games.\nAdChoices When the wild card games began in 2012, they were unlike anything Major League Baseball had ever seen before. Sure, elimination games have existed as long as the World Series, but a one-game series was a new idea.\nFans weren’t really sure what to expect, and through eight games, it’s really hard to make a definitive judgment on the best way to win the play-in game, but why not take a shot?\nOne thing is certain, the wild card games have been memorable. The 2012 NL wild card game gave us Braves fans showering the field with garbage after a phantom infield fly call. 2013 featured the long beleaguered Pirates winning their first postseason game since 1992. The 2014 AL wild card game was a 12-inning affair. Then this year featured dominant performances from Jake Arrieta and Dallas Keuchel.\nThis year’s and last year’s results indicate that strong pitching is a prerequisite. Stock the top of your rotation with a Cy Young candidate and reap the rewards, right?\nMaybe not.\nIn 2012, fringe Cy Young candidate Yu Darvish started the AL wild card game for the Rangers against the Orioles. Darvish was good, if not dominant, pitching 7.2 innings and allowing just two runs, but was still saddled with the loss.\nJohnny Cueto pitched for the Reds in 2013, facing off against Francisco Liriano. Cueto was not a Cy Young candidate in 2013 because he missed most of the season due to injury, only starting 11 games, but he was and is still considered an ace pitcher. Despite his best efforts, Cueto couldn’t make it out of the fourth inning against the Pirates in a losing effort.\nMadison Bumgarner, Jake Arrieta and Dallas Keuchel are all special exceptions. Arietta just pitched one of the most dominant second halves we have ever seen, Bumgarner followed up his wild card complete game in 2014 with an unbelievably dominant playoff run, and Dallas Keuchel is the clear-cut AL Cy Young award winner in 2015. These three pitchers are unmatched among the other five wild card game starters.\nBut what about a strong regular-season offense? That must carry over.There are eight wild card losers through four years: the 2012 Rangers, 2012 Braves, 2013 Indians, 2013 Reds, 2014 A’s, 2014 Pirates, 2015 Yankees and 2015 Pirates.\n© Provided by Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC So being a good offense for 162 games doesn’t necessarily guarantee you will be able to outscore your opponent for nine innings on one night in October. In fact, scoring hundreds of runs in the regular season doesn’t even guarantee one run in the wild card game.\nIt’s only fair to point out the 2014 AL wild card game, which saw the A’s score eight runs in 12 innings but fall 9-8 to the Royals. Clearly the offense held up its end of the game there.\nThe MLB postseason is notoriously random. The 2001 Mariners won 116 games and didn’t even make it to the World Series, while the 2006 Cardinals won 83 games and won the whole thing. Through four years of wild card games, it’s clear that the elimination game follows a similar narrative: It’s just as random as the rest of the playoffs.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://thesportsquotient.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:54:56.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
