( Armando Trovati, The Associated Press ) \nFour-time World Cup overall champion Lindsey Vonn returns to Europe Tuesday for the World Cup, but it is uncertain whether she will race in Saturday's season-opening giant slalom in Soelden, Austria. \nVonn fractured her left ankle two months ago while training GS in New Zealand, forcing her to miss a subsequent downhill training camp in Portillo, Chile. She has not been on snow since the accident. \n\"I'm going to go over there and get on snow and see how I feel and make the decision then,\" Vonn said in a phone interview Monday. \"Obviously it's asking a lot, but I left New Zealand skiing very well in GS, so I don't want to rule it out until I get on snow.\" \nVonn, the winningest female in World Cup history , turned 31 on Sunday. With 67 World Cup victories, she will begin the season only 19 behind the record holder, Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden (86). She broke Annemarie Moser-Proell's women's record (62) last season. \nJohn Meyer: jmeyer@denverpost.com or @johnmeyer Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:31:40.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
