He began the game with 267 strikeouts and broke the mark set by Hall of Famer Ed Walsh in 1908 when he struck out 269 batters. \nSale's record came on an eventful day for the White Sox. Earlier Friday, general manager Rick Hahn said he expected manager Robin Ventura to return, and also announced the team would not be retaining bench coach Mark Parent after the end of a disappointing season. \nSale allowed Jefry Marte's second-inning homer while giving up five hits and striking out seven to end his season with 274. Entering play Friday, Sale led the American League in strikeouts and was second in the majors behind only Los Angeles Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw (294). \nSale (13-11) had been struggling recently. Friday was his first win since Aug. 21 and he snapped a four-game losing streak. He was helped by J.B. Shuck's diving catch in right field of a drive by Dixon Machado that ended the seventh. \nDavid Robertson picked up his 34th save in 41 tries and Chicago won for only the second time in six games. \nAlfredo Simon went eight innings and gave up two runs and five hits to lose his third consecutive decision. Simon (13-12) couldn't keep Detroit from losing its fifth in six games, though it did lead early. \nMarte gave the Tigers a 1-0 lead when he led off the second with a home run into the bullpen in left. Chicago went in front 2-1 in the third on Adam Eaton's two-run double. \nTRAINER'S ROOM \nTigers: DH Victor Martinez (left quadriceps soreness) was held out of the lineup and is day-to-day. He left Monday's game against Texas after sustaining the injury while advancing from first to third and hasn't played since. \nWhite Sox: C Tyler Flowers will have right knee surgery next week to remove floating cartilage. \nUP NEXT \nDetroit RHP Justin Verlander (5-8, 3.39) faces Chicago RHP Erik Johnson (3-1, 3.45) on Saturday. Verlander has won his last two starts, allowing four earned runs in 13 innings. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T05:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:45:54.746+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
