The defense is back to making plays.\nAfter questioning the Sooners' relevancy earlier this season, ESPN personality Paul Finebaum did penance by wearing an OU hat on-air after the Sooners' win at Tennessee.\nAs the Sooners look ahead to Saturday's AT&T Red River Showdown with Texas at the Cotton Bowl Stadium, OU seem poised to join No. 2 TCU and No. 3 Baylor as real-deal national contenders.\nOr the Sooners could be fool's gold, like last season. Oklahoma climbed as high as No. 4 in the AP poll early in the season, then dropped five of their last nine games with embarrassing losses to Baylor and Clemson.\nMaybe this is the Oklahoma team everybody expected in 2014, arriving a year late.\nESPN analyst Kirk Herbstreit jumped on the Sooner Schooner early, picking Oklahoma before the season to be one of the four teams in the College Football Playoff.\n\"I think Oklahoma is going to surprise everybody,\" Herbstreit said at the time.\nNeither coach Bob Stoops nor his players exactly embraced the West Virginia win as a statement game.\n\"I don't know about that,\" center Ty Darlington said. \"It was definitely a start today, great way to start conference play, but now we've got eight more conference games in a row, so we're going straight down the gauntlet and will have plenty of more opportunities to make statements.\"\nWhile Oklahoma (4-0, 1-0) enters on a hot streak, Texas (1-4, 0-2) is more of a hot mess. The Longhorns haven't been this bad this early in the season since the Eisenhower Administration. En route to 1-9 finish in 1956, Texas suffered a 45-0 loss to No. 1 Oklahoma.\nTexas sits near the bottom of a bunch of national defensive stats. No team in the Bowl Subdivision has allowed more first downs.\nEven social media has been a problem. Freshman cornerback Kris Boyd issued an apology through the school Sunday for a halftime Twitter excursion during a 50-7 loss to TCU. The retweet suggested Boyd and fellow freshman Malik Jefferson consider a transfer to Texas A&M.\n\"In NO way did I intend to be disrespectful or disloyal,\" Boyd said in part. \"I deeply regret my actions and want to reassure everyone that I am 100 [percent] committed to this team and program. ...\n\"I promise everyone that I will learn and grow from this.\"\nDon't expect Oklahoma to look past Texas, no matter the records.\n\"Yeah, it's always a game you want to play in as a little kid and now it's finally here,\" Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield said. \"Even with how they're playing right now, you can't go in there and take them lightly.\"\nJust two years ago, with the Mack Brown era on life support, Case McCoy led a 36-20 Texas win over the 12th ranked Sooners that wasn't close.\nEven for a team with big ambitions, rivalry games can become roadblocks. And few rivalries match Texas-OU.\n\"We know they are moving a little slow but every year they are ready for us,\" Oklahoma linebacker Eric Striker told reporters. \"We can't sleep on them.\n\"That's one team that you know you have to be ready for -- this one.\"\nThree takeaways Three takeaways from this past weekend in the Big 12:\n-- Baylor junior quarterback Seth Russell leads the nation in passing efficiency and ranks eighth in total offense (363.3 yards per game).\n-- Oklahoma State defensive end Emmanuel Ogbah has 6.5 sacks this season through five games and is tied for fifth nationally. He's been remarkably consistent with 11 sacks in his last 13 games.\n-- The 30 points allowed by Texas in the first quarter against TCU was the most since Houston scored 31 on the Longhorns in 1987.\nOn Twitter:\n @ChuckCarltonDMN", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ChuckCarltonDMN"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:30:59.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
