Working collaboratively, the Promotion Club of Jamestown, Tuolumne County, California State Parks and Railtown recently completed the “Walk of Fame” in Jamestown. To celebrate the completion of the project, the community is invited to dedication at 11 a.m. Saturday at the walk’s starting point — Rocca Park on Main Street in Jamestown. Festivities will include appearances by local officials and light refreshments will be provided. Afterward, participants will be invited to enjoy the walk with many of those involved in its creation. The “Walk of Fame” project was the vision of a group of involved community members led by Jim O’Neil. Taking advantage of a planned sidewalk improvement project, the group worked diligently to raise enough private donations to fund having brass medallions created and embedded in the sidewalk from downtown Jamestown to Railtown. The California State Railroad Museum Foundation sponsored two medallions — one at the beginning and one at the end of the “walk”— and joined a number of other sponsors to provide funds for creating an eye-catching mural design that is currently in development. From Railtown, visitors to the park can enjoy the walk on their way to downtown Jamestown for food and shopping. From downtown Jamestown, people can follow the walk to visit the “Movie Star” steam locomotive Sierra No. 3 at Railtown. The walk currently has 30 medallions, but was built with the capacity to add more medallions over time. The walk begins in downtown Jamestown with an informational kiosk providing images and details of the county’s rich film heritage. The group is also working on plans for a historic mural at the corner of Seco and Main Streets, highlighting Jamestown’s history and role as a gateway to Tuolumne County. Tuolumne County, the Sierra Railway and Railtown 1897 SHP — whose historic shops, Roundhouse and famous Sierra No. 3 locomotive — have long served as a filming location for the film and television industry with more than 150 movies and television shows filmed at Railtown. Commemorated on the “Walk of Fame” are 30 productions, including “High Noon” (1952), “Petticoat Junction” (1963), “Back to the Future III” (1990), “Lassie” (1954), “Little House on the Prairie” (1974), “My Little Chickadee” (1940), “Unforgiven” (1992), and even a medallion dedicated to Huell Howser. Also Saturday, Railtown will host special apple harvest-related activities that aim to help to connect the history of local agriculture with the railroad. Activities for the day include interpretive displays of “fruit crate art” throughout the park; a slide presentation about the growth of the local apple industry and its roots to the railroad; live “original old-timey” music by the group Faux Renwah; hands-on arts and crafts for kids, and more. Citing a climate and soils perfect for the production of apples, the Sierra Railway promoted the early development of apple orchards in the region through continuous advertising and even encouraged people to move to Tuolumne County and grow apples. As added incentives, the railroad offered a bonus to those planting new orchards of 10 acres or more, free apple saplings, and also produced an informative booklet on apple cultivation. Eventually the railway’s efforts paid off and, at one point in time, the demand became so high that Tuolumne County apples weren’t even available for local residents to purchase. The apple harvest activities at Railtown 1897 are free with regular park admission: $5 for adults, $3 for children ages 6 to 17, and free for children ages 5 and under. Additionally, steam train rides behind the “Movie Star Locomotive” Sierra No. 3 are available that day at 10:30 a.m., noon, 1:30 and 3 p.m. Cost is $15 for adults; $10 for children ages 6 to 17; and are free for children ages 5 and under (train ride tickets include park admission). For more information, call 984-3953 or visit railtown1897.org. Additionally, a new Jamestown Art Walk will be held from 4 to 8 p.m. Saturday on Main Street. Businesses will host area artists with mini “galleries” to share and sell their art. There are at least 15 artists confirmed for the event, which aims to celebrate National Arts and Humanities Month — the month of October. The Tuolumne County Arts Alliance has provided funding for music. Tell River and Minor Birds will be performing in Rocca Park at the newly-restored gazebo, and guitarist Nicholas Lefler will be performing at Gianelli Vineyard’s tasting room, 18158 Main St. Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:17:00.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
