The college then activated its emergency-alert system, informing students and employees of the threat. The alert was followed by a message on Twitter, asking everyone to evacuate.\nShortly afterward, Rogue officials sent out an evacuation notice for the Riverside campus , which spans four blocks in downtown Medford, and for the Table Rock campus in White City.\nAll have been advised to take their backpacks, computers and cell phones and have been urged not to wait at transit stops adjacent to the campuses.\nOregon State Police have launched a criminal investigation, but no results or details have been released.\n-- Rick Bella rbella@oregonian.com\n503-294-5915; @southnewshound", "external_links": ["http://www.roguecc.edu/Maps/DirectionsTRC.asp", "http://www.roguecc.edu/", "http://www.roguecc.edu/Maps/DirectionsRWC.asp", "http://www.roguecc.edu/Maps/DirectionsRVC.asp", "https://twitter.com/southnewshound", "http://www.oregon.gov/osp/Pages/index.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-05T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:36:54.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
