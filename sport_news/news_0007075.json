Which is no surprise. We all have to eat, after all. And although the slated Nov. 25 closure of the Haggen store at 1120 Campbell St. won’t leave shoppers without an option, we have over the decades become accustomed to having two major grocery chains — Safeway and Albertsons — from which to choose our staples. This history is the main reason we’re optimistic that when Haggen closes its Baker City store — which was, until mid-May, an Albertsons grocery — customers won’t have to wait too long before they’ll again have stores facing each other across Campbell. Moreover, we hope the 50 or so Haggen employees — almost all of whom previously worked for Albertsons — can soon find jobs with a new grocery company here. Haggen announced this week that it has asked a Delaware bankruptcy court to approve the company’s plan to try to sell more than 100 stores, including the Baker City location, by auction in November. We’re not grocery industry insiders. But considering the city’s retail track record, and the relative stability of its population, we think we’re on pretty firm ground, economically speaking, in predicting that the local customer base is sufficient to continue supporting two full-service grocers. Haggen’s failure might suggest otherwise, except the company’s problems are not at all unique to its Baker City store. In fact Haggen plans to close the vast majority of the 146 stores it bought early this year from the newly merged Albertsons-Safeway corporation. It seems a clearcut case of a company that tried to grow too quickly. We’re pleased to see that two chains have already bid to buy 36 Haggen stores in California and Nevada. We hope a competitor sees similar potential in Baker City.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:05:04.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
