He said it appeared that any threat of violence was contained at McCurdy.\nThere were also reports of a threatening Web posting.\nApodaca said panic may have been caused by students and parents sharing inaccurate information.\n“It appears to be negative rumors that spread like wildfire and took off,” Apodaca said. “It was a harmless thing with stupid words chosen by kids. It appears that there was no direct threat to students and staff, but we take threats like this very seriously.”\nStill, there was enough concern for Superintendent Gutierrez to shut down EVHS on Wednesday “after careful consideration and a lengthy conversation with the investigating officer,” according to a statement posted on the district’s website that was later removed.\n“At the current time, we do not have any reason to believe any of our elementary schools or our middle school is in danger, and all schools, other than the high school, will be on a regular schedule on Wednesday,” Gutierrez added in the statement.\nApodaca said that police have a person of interest in the case, a student who has been suspended by McCurdy, but that investigators have not talked with that student. Police were patrolling both schools Wednesday, and Apodaca said Española police, State Police and the Rio Arriba and Santa Fe county sheriff’s offices ramped up patrols in Española and the surrounding areas and will continue to do so in the coming days as a precaution.\nA volleyball game between EVHS and Los Alamos High School was played in Los Alamos on Wednesday night instead of Española.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:28:01.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
