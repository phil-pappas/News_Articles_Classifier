(AP) - An Albright College football player has been suspended from school and jailed on attempted homicide and other charges for allegedly stabbing a teammate with a corkscrew during a fight at a dormitory. \nThe Reading Eagle (http://bit.ly/1PpGzej ) reports 18-year-old Marquis Stewart, of Bethlehem, was arrested after the incident about 2 a.m. Sunday in Crowell Hall. \nThe victim, another freshman football player, 18-year-old Dhameer Madison, of New Castle, Delaware, was taken to Reading Hospital where he was in stable condition. \nPolice say the men fought after an earlier altercation that investigators didn’t describe. \nAt some point, Madison allegedly punched steward, who then grabbed a multi-tool device and used the corkscrew portion to stab Madison three times in the left rib cage. \nA school spokesman says Stewart is suspended. Online court records don’t list a defense attorney. \n___ \nInformation from: Reading Eagle, http://www.readingeagle.com/ \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T14:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:44:41.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
