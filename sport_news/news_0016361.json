Bye weeks and injuries (sorry, Jamaal Charles owners) are wreaking havoc on fantasy squads.\nHere are the waiver targets for Week 6.\nCharcandrick West , RB, Kansas City Chiefs (Yahoo! 13 percent owned, CBSSports 8 percent)\nJamaal Charles owners are scrambling to find a replacement after the running back suffered a torn ACL Sunday. While Knile Davis opened the season as the Chiefs' No. 2 back, his workload has been taken over by West in recent weeks , according to The Kansas City Star. West also has better hands than Davis, according to the report, which would make him much more valuable in PPR leagues. While the Chiefs may go with a committee in the backfield, West should be the most consistent back. Also, Minnesota has allowed 125.5 rushing yards a game (7th most in the NFL) and 4.7 yards per carry (5th most).\nTeddy Bridgewater , QB, Minnesota Vikings (Yahoo! 44 percent, CBSSports 41 percent)\nBridgewater came off his best game of the season against the Broncos when he threw for 269 yards and a touchdown. Against Kansas City, he faces a team who's allowed the most passing TDs (13) and an average of 284.6 yards a game (6th most). Now back from their bye week, the Vikings may be getting back receivers Mike Wallace, who suffered an injury against Denver, and Charles Johnson, who's recovering from a rib injury.\nMarvin Jones , WR, Cincinnati Bengals (Yahoo! 36 percent, CBSSports 43 percent)\nAdvertisement Quarterback Andy Dalton likes to spread the ball around as four different players were targeted eight times against the Seahawks. One of them was Jones who pulled in five catches for 61 yards. Buffalo has allowed 10 receiving TDs (4th most) and an average of 274 passing yards (9th most) this year.\nGary Barnidge , TE, Cleveland Browns (Yahoo! 53 percent, CBSSports 59 percent)\nMr. \"I can catch footballs with my legs\" has become a favorite target for quarterback Josh McCown. Barnidge has had 26 targets in the last three games, resulting in 20 receptions for 319 yards and three TDs. Facing the top-rated Broncos defense will limit his chances this week, but look for him to be a consistent producer the rest of the year.", "external_links": ["http://www.kansascity.com/sports/nfl/kansas-city-chiefs/article38869491.html"], "published": "2015-10-13T12:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:05:36.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
