The Memphis native had never been on a winning team in high school or college. \n\"I got lucky being drafted by Green Bay,\" said Hathcock, a defensive back and special teams standout. \nDid he ever. \nThe Packers were the defending NFL champions, winner of titles three times in the previous five seasons. Aptly nicknamed \"Titletown,\" Green Bay was the league powerhouse poised to continue a run that would ultimately produce an unprecedented three consecutive titles. \nWhen Hathcock first heard Green Bay head coach Vince Lombardi speak in the Packers' initial team meeting at training camp, he was amazed, and not in a good way. \n\"He held up a ball and said, 'This is a football,'\" Hathcock, now 72, said with a laugh. \"I thought he was crazy.\" \nBut the hall of fame head coach was making a point. \n\"The basics, the fundamentals,\" Hathcock said. \"That's what he stressed and what he started with: blocking and tackling.\" \nThe defensive back would be one of only three of the Packers' 20 draft picks to crack the talented roster, along with co-No. 1 selections Jim Grabowski (fullback, Illinois) and Gale Gillingham (tackle, Minnesota). \nLinebacker Dave Robinson said he knew Hathcock belonged. \n\"You could see he was a player with the speed and ability to make this team and we were pretty good,\" Robinson said. \"He did everything the Packer coaches asked of him and he was a good guy off the field and a good teammate on it. Dave was always a Packer at heart.\" \nHathcock would only play one season as a reserve defensive back before being traded to the New York Giants in 1967. \n\"Lombardi had great leadership and he assembled like-minded players and developed team chemistry,\" Hathcock said. \n\"I didn't get to really see a lot of coach Lombardi because he was a very offensive-minded coach who seldom came in and talked to us on defense. He'd talk to the whole team in meetings 10-15 minutes every day and that was very inspirational.\" \nLike all rookies during training camp, Hathcock had to take his turn entertaining the veterans with a song. But there was one problem. \n\"I can't sing, I can't carry a tune at all,\" he said. \"So all the veterans booed me.\" \nHathcock then made up a song about the fact that he couldn't sing. \n\"I looked around and Coach Lombardi was laughing, so I knew he had a sense of humor,\" he said. \nLombardi had little patience for fumbling, as Hathcock found out in one of his first practice sessions. \n\"Donny Anderson was our punter — a left footer,\" he said. \"The ball rotation is different and I dropped one. Well, Lombardi started yelling at me to get off the field so I did. After a while, (defensive coordinator) Phil (Bengtson) said I could come back to practice.\" \nHathcock remembers the pat on the back he received from the head coach that bolstered his morale. \n\"He said that I'd be a vital part of this organization,\" he recalled. \"That meant a lot, as I really didn't talk to him much one-on-one.\" \nThe Packers, led by league MVP Bart Starr, were dominant in fashioning a 12-2 record and winning the Western Conference title by three games over the Baltimore Colts. Green Bay's only losses were to San Francisco (21-20) and Minnesota (20-17). \n\"Bart had a such a great season (2,257 yards, 14 touchdowns, 3 interceptions, 105.0 passer rating), but what was more impressive than his ability was his character,\" Hathcock said. \nThe Packers defeated the Cowboys in Dallas, 34-27, as Starr threw four touchdown passes in the NFL championship. \n\"It was a great championship game and Dallas and Don Meredith had five downs from the 6 (-yard line) and couldn't get in the end zone against our defense,\" he said. \"Robinson hit Meredith and Tom Brown made the interception in the end zone.\" \nThe Packers then moved on to face the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFL-NFL World Championship game in Los Angeles, later dubbed Super Bowl I. \nAt the time, Hathcock didn't understand the historical significance of Green Bay's 35-10 victory in the inaugural meeting on rival league champions. \n\"To me, every game was important — every play, every quarter, every game,\" he said. \"We didn't know how special it was to beat Kansas City in Los Angeles. There were 65,000 fans and a lot of vacant seats. And I remember the guy with the jet pack (a pre-game demonstration).\" \nHathcock earned a Super Bowl ring, and a highlight to him was the reunion of that team at Lambeau Field last September during alumni weekend against Seattle and the ensuing weeklong, whirlwind tour to visit Packer fans. \n\"It was such a great experience to reconnect with my teammates and meet Packer fans,\" he said. \"We went to a practice and Aaron Rodgers stopped by on the sideline and said hi to us and I shook his hand. Then players like Randall Cobb and coach (Mike) McCarthy. \n\"That was nice to do. They have a lot of respect for us and what we accomplished and that's neat.\" \nHathcock is looking forward to seeing Starr, health permitting, and Rodgers at Lambeau Field on Thanksgiving night for Brett Favre's number retirement against the Bears. \n\"Those three players were just so talented and important to the success of the franchise,\" he said. \"It will be incredible to see them on the same field. That will be a special moment.\" DAVE HATHCOCK FILE \nPackers years : 1966 \nJersey No. : 45 \nPackers highlights : Member of Super Bowl I team. Reserve defensive back and special teams standout.
