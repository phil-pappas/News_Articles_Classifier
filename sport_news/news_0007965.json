Villaruel   16, 2015 - 12:00am \nCARSON CITY, California — Two-division world champion Donnie 'Ahas' Nietes of Cebu's famed ALA Boxing Gym and his Mexican challenger Juan 'Pinky' Alejo will meet each other in flesh for the first time in the final press conference of the historic 'Pinoy Pride 33:Philippines versus the World' fightcard this Thursday morning (Friday Philippine time) at the Carson Civic Center. \nThough cool and silent since they arrived in the Golden State, Nietes (36-1-4, 21KOs) and Alejo (21-3, 13KOs) are expected to trade verbal jabs two days ahead of their 12-round championship bout headlining the breakthrough Pinoy Pride event of ALA Promotions and ABS-CBN in the United States set to take place on Saturday night (Sunday morning in Philippines) at the StubHub Center. \nArmed with vast experience, sheer talent and hard training capped by a torrid sparring session with fellow countryman Brian Viloria, the 33-year-old pride of Murcia, Negros Occidental expressed confidence of hurdling his WBO light flyweight title defense for the eight time against Alejo in his US debut. \n“ I am 100 percent confident that I will win. This is the fight I have been waiting for a long time to fight in America and showcase my boxing skill in front of the world. My family and ALA Boxing Promotions inspire me to excel in every fight I have been to. For this fight, it is very imperative that we win so that we can give honor to our country and to our countrymen,” said Nietes in a report by US-based Filipino sportscribe Rod Mijares posted on philboxing.com. \nUnbeaten in 11 years that eventually earned him a record-establishing feat as the longest reigning Filipino world boxing champion, Nietes really know the significance of this bout where he stakes practically everything in his career. \nAside from Nietes, celebrated brothers 'Prince' Albert and Jason \"El Niño\" Pagara, as well as rising ALA star Mark 'Magnifico\" Magsayo are also primed and ready to showcase their fistic skills in the boxing mecca of the world.   \nAlbert Pagara, the reigning IBF Intercontinental super bantamweight champion and unscathed in 24 fights spiked with 17KOs, will slug it out with Nicaraguan power-hitter William Gonzales (27-5, 23KOs), while his older brother Jason (36-2, 22KOs), the WBO International super lightweight title-holder, will face off with Santos Benavides (25-7-2, 19KOs), also of Nicaragua. \nMagsayo (11-0, (9KOs), on the other hand, will put his IBF Youth featherweight crown on the line against Mexican Yardley Suarez (13-0, 8KOs) in an exciting showdown of two young undefeated prospects.
