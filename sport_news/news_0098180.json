The 29-year-old eventually served out the set to win it 6-3. \nAllertova, a finalist at the WTA Guangzhou Open, had her serve broken twice more in the second set before claiming a break in the sixth. \nBut the world number 110 used all of her experience to seal the match, winning the set 6-4 and advance to semi-finals as she looks to secure only her second WTA singles title. \nNext up for Flipkens is seventh seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova after the Russian defeated Serbian qualifier Aleksandra Krunic 6-3 6-3. \nIn a week where seeds have crashed out early Pavlyuchenkova, the highest seed left in the draw, needed three breaks of serve to emerge victorious. \nElsewhere Germany's Anna Lena Friedsam advanced to her first WTA semi-final since winning the Investec Ilkley Open in August after a comprehensive straight-sets victory over Russia's Magarita Gasparyan. \nFriedsam, who has yet to drop a set in her previous two meeting against the Russian, needed an hour and 13 minutes to win 6-3 6-4, seizing three of five break point opportunities. \nThe German will face world number 59 Johanna Larsson after she came out on top in her tightly contested quarter-final beating American Madison Brengle 7-5 7-6 (8/6).
