While the Jayhawks are still in rebuilding mode -- which they have seemingly been in since the end of the 2008 season -- Texas Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury said Monday the Red Raiders won't be taking the winless 'Hawks lightly.\nHere are five things to know about Kansas:\nRecord: 0-5, 0-2 Big 12\nLast: Lost to Baylor, 66-7, on Oct. 10\nKey number: One -- the number of wins Kansas has all time vs. Texas Tech (34-31 in 2001).\n1. Quarterback of the future? The Jayhawks turned to true-freshman quarterback Ryan Willis on Saturday, and despite the lopsided score (66-7), he earned a heap of praise from quarterback guru and Baylor coach Art Briles.\n\"If I was a Kansas Jayhawk, I'd be a little bit excited,\" Briles said after the game . \"I think the guy's really good -- looked really good today.\"\nWillis, a 6-foot-4, pro-style quarterback who turned down offers from Kansas State and Illinois to join Kansas, was 20-of-36 passing for 158 yards, one touchdown and one interception. He replaced Matt Cozart one week earlier after the upperclassman left with a sprained left shoulder ion a loss to Iowa State.\n2. Running free. There are only two teams in the Big 12 that allow an average of 200-plus yards rushing per game: Texas Tech and Kansas. The Red Raiders have seemingly struggled for the past decade to stop the run, but the past two years have been catastrophic -- Kansas hasn't fared too much better. The Jayhawks allow an average of 257.4 yards on the ground per game, including 281 in a 66-7 loss to Baylor last weekend. Kansas has allowed a 100-yard rusher in four of its five games this season -- good news for Red Raiders running back DeAndre Washington, who chips in 97.7 yards per contest.\n3. Discipline. There's only a handful of Big 12 statistical categories Kansas is in the top half of, but its most impressive stat has been its ability to keep yellow off the field. The Jayhawks average 5.4 penalties per game (fewest in the Big 12) under first-year head coach David Beaty. Kansas also is plus-2 in turnover margin this season, meaning teams cannot expect to get too many freebies from the Jayhawks. Kansas however, hasn't been able to take advantage of its clean play -- the Jayhawks rank last in the Big 12 in both scoring offense and defense.\n4. Texas represent. The Jayhawks turned to former Texas high school football coach David Beaty -- a Garland native -- to turn around a program that hasn't been to a bowl game since 2008 and has lost 60 of its past 72 games. Beaty, known for his recruiting chops, will likely look south when building his program. Kansas currently has an impressive 45 players on its official roster from the state of Texas, easily the mos-represented state (Kansas is second with 26). Leading Kansas rusher Ke'aun Kinner (Little Elm) is one of a handful of Texans to keep an eye on Saturday.\n5. Bad start to the season. Kansas nearly rallied from a 31-7 deficit against FCS power South Dakota State to start the season -- but the Jayhawks are the owners of one of the most gut-wrenching final plays of the season. Down by three with two seconds left, quarterback Cozart tried to clock the ball to either give Kansas a long field-goal opportunity or touchdown heave. Instead, he fumbled the ball and hopped on top of it -- meaning the clock kept running. Kansas hasn't recovered since the, losing all five of its games as the Jayhawks seem destined for their worst season in school history.
