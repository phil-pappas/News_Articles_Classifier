He hasn't.\nHudler tallied twice in Tuesday's 2-0 exhibition victory over the Colorado Avalanche at the Saddledome, a good sign as he tries to build on a career-best offensive campaign that was capped by a shoeless (and hilarious) acceptance speech as the 2015 Lady Byng Memorial Trophy winner.\nThe national anthem was likely still echoing in the rafters when Hudler opened the scoring Tuesday. He and linemate Johnny Gaudreau played keepaway with the puck on their first shift, with Hudler finishing off a dandy give-and-go by cranking a one-timer over Calvin Pickard's shoulder just 24 seconds after puck-drop.\nHudler's second of the night was a tap-in. After fanning on his shot attempt from the slot, Flames newbie Michael Frolik slid a pass to his Czech countryman, who was parked at the post for an easy finish.\nFrolik, who signed a five-year, US$21.5-million deal with the Flames on Canada Day, has hit the scoresheet in each of his three pre-season appearances with his new squad — totalling two goals and two assists.\nTuesday's contest didn't do much to help solve the Flames' goaltending conundrum, with Jonas Hiller and Karri Ramo splitting a shutout against a roster than better resembles the Avs' affiliate in San Antonio.\nHiller made 15 saves as the starter, while Ramo stopped all 14 shots fired his direction.\nAll that remains on the Flames' pre-season slate is a home-and-home set against the Winnipeg Jets, starting with Thursday's meeting at MTS Centre.\nwes.gilbertson@sunmedia.ca\nwww.twitter.com/SUNGilbertson\n3 STARS\nFlames RW Jiri Hudle r — Star right-winger scored twice, but he'll save his hat-tricks for the regular season.\nFlames C/W Sam Bennett — Played some wing.

Follow below this story.

But with three games remaining in the exhibition slate, we'll be soon getting to the short strokes.\nLINEUP NOTES: Calgary will skate last season's top trio of Johnny Gaudreau, Sean Monahan and Jiri Hudler, at least to start the game before the mixing begins.\nAmong the bubble boys in the lineup are forwards Markus Granlund, Paul Byron, Drew Shore and Garnet Hathaway and defenceman Ryan Wilson.\nJonas Hiller is to start in goal but give way to Karri Ramo.\nThe Avs are bringing a rather no-name group, with Nathan MacKinnon the headliner, local product Conner Bleackley and former Flames Reto Berra and Blake Coumeau.\n(NOTE: The Avalanche announced in the afternoon that Curtis Glencross - the former Flames left-winger, who is with them on a tryout basis - will indeed be part of the lineup in Calgary.)\nBURNING QUESTION: Now that the big wave of cuts have been made by the Flames, who now is able to pull away from the pack battling for the sixth and seventh defenceman spots and fourth-line and 13th/14th forwards?\nPLAYERS TO WATCH:\nAvalanche: Conner Bleackley is a High River native who is also captain of the WHL's Red Deer Rebels and a 2014 first-round draft choice.\nFlames: Sam Bennett is slated to start on the left wing on a line with Mikael Backlund and Michael Frolik but move to centre at some point in the game.\nFlames Lines\nFORWARDS\nJohnny Gaudreau-Sean Monahan -Jiri Hudler\nSam Bennett-Mikael Backlund-Michael Frolik\nMicheal Ferland-Markus Granlund-Josh Jooris\nPaul Byron-Drew Shore-Garnet Hathaway\nDEFENCE\nMark Giordano-Dougie Hamilton\nKris Russell-Dennis Wideman\nRyan Wilson-Deryk Engelland\nGOAL\nJonas Hiller\nKarri Ramo\nFlames beat Avalanche 2-0 in pre-season matchup\n2 sec. 3 sec. 4 sec. 5 sec. 6 sec.
