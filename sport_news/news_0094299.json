We need to bounce back and beat TCU on Friday and go have a great week at the conference tournament. If we do that, we’ll keep playing.” \nThe Cowgirls ended the match outshooting the Jayhawks 15-13, however KU managed to put more shots on target at 4-3. Twenty-nine fouls were called between the two squads in what was a physical match in addition to six yellow cards, four of which were on the Jayhawks. \nKansas will now close out the regular season when the Jayhawks host TCU at 7 p.m. Friday at Rock Chalk Park. \nIt will be the final home match for seniors Liana Salazar, Ashley Williams and Courtney Dickerson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:50:39.147+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
