We can’t worry about Saturday’s result.” \nEven if coach Eddie Jones’ players don’t progress to the knockout stage, they’re among the stars of the World Cup. \nIt all started on the first weekend of the tournament, on a sunny afternoon on the English south coast, when Japan stunned two-time champion South Africa with a 34-32 win in Brighton. It turned the form-guide upside down. \nJapan had previously only won one World Cup match. Now they’re aiming for three in four matches. \nSuddenly, rugby, a niche sport in a country where baseball, soccer and sumo wrestling dominate, is in vogue. \nLast Saturday, 25 million people watched on TV as Japan beat Samoa 26-5. \nThat beat the previous national TV audience record for a Rugby World Cup match - set by the French for their team’s loss to England in the 2007 semifinals - by more than four million. \nIf Samoa does Japan a favor and beats the Scots, then the TV viewing record could well be eclipsed on Sunday night - even if the 8 p.m. kick off local time in Gloucester is 4 a.m. in Tokyo. \nHere’s a look at Sunday’s four games at the Rugby World Cup: \n___ \nARGENTINA vs. NAMIBIA (2-0, both in RWC), Leicester, 1100 GMT \nArgentina has already qualified for the quarterfinals, courtesy of New Zealand’s win over Tonga on Friday, and selected a team with that in mind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:09:14.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
