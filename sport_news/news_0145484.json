(AP Photo/Alan Diaz) \nDAVIE, Florida — Kevin Coyle's replacement as the Miami Dolphins' defensive coordinator wasn't ready to explain Thursday how he's going fix what's wrong. \n\"I found out about an hour ago that I got this job,\" Lou Anarumo said. \"It's a little bit early to say.\" \nDon't fault Anarumo if he felt a bit overwhelmed. He has lots of problems to address after being promoted from defensive backs coach when new interim coach Dan Campbell fired Coyle. \nThe moves came after the Dolphins fired head coach Joe Philbin on Monday and promoted tight ends coach Campbell. The Dolphins have a bye this week and next play at Tennessee on Oct. 18. \nCoyle was widely criticized for the decline of the defense since he joined the Dolphins in 2012. They gave up 317 points that season, followed by 335 and 373, and after four games they're on pace to allow 404 this season. \nMiami (1-3) ranks last in the NFL in rushing defense at 160.5 yards per game, and last with one sack despite the offseason addition of $114 million tackle Ndamukong Suh. \nCampbell has said the defense needed to become more aggressive and physical. He described Anarumo as the right man for the coordinator's job. \n\"Lou and I see eye to eye about what we need to do defensively moving forward,\" Campbell said. \"It's a move that is going to help us win games.\" \nAnarumo has been with the Dolphins since 2012. Before that he was defensive backs coach at Purdue from 2004 to 2011. \nHe said he was surprised to be promoted to defensive coordinator, but added such a job has been his ambition. \n\"I've been working toward this,\" Anarumo said. \"As an assistant coach, you're always looking to advance. You set goals for yourself, and this is certainly one of them.\" \nAnarumo acknowledged he needs more impact from an underachieving front four that includes Suh, tackle Earl Mitchell and ends Cameron Wake and Olivier Vernon. \n\"Every one of those guys up front has demonstrated in their career that they can be productive players,\" Anarumo said. \"That's going to be our charge as coaches — to get that out of them going forward.\" \nJeff Burris, a defensive assistant since 2013, was promoted to assistant defensive backs coach. The latest moves complete this week's shake-up of the coaching staff, Campbell said. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:44:58.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
