We doubt anybody saw Marco Estrada (you mean that guy they got for Adam Lind?) limiting the Kansas City Royals to three hits into the eighth inning, for example. Or Chris Colabello hammering a home run that looked, for the longest time, to be the only run that Estrada would need.\nOh, yeah, and how about that Troy Tulowitzki three-run double? I beg your pardon? Troy (bleeping) Tulowitzki, playing for the Blue Jays? And try this on for size: Wasn’t that David Price warming up in the bullpen in the seventh inning?\nBut life is what happens when you’re making other plans. That’s it in a nutshell for this 7-1 victory over the Royals in a bounce-back, must-win, Game 5 that keeps Toronto’s playoff run alive. As a result, the ALCS goes back to Missouri for Game 6 on Friday and possibly a Game 7 on Saturday, with the Royals leading the best-of-even series 3-2.\nBUFFERY: Forget Tulo's glove, it's his bat\nSIMMONS: Estrada powered by electric Rogers Centre\nLONGLEY: Royals crying foul over 'missed' call\nRUTSEY: Blue Jays coming alive in Game 5s\nA day after the Blue Jays were waffled 14-2 by the Royals in Game 4, Estrada imposed his will on the dangerous Kansas City lineup, painting the corners of the plate all afternoon. Over the first 6.2 innings, he faced the minimum 20 batters. The one base-runner he allowed was erased on a double play.\n“It’s been a while since I pitched (at home),” said Estrada. “And I forgot how great our fans are. It was pretty loud today. I had a lot of adrenalin going. The fans got me going early on and made it a lot more fun.”\nHe ran into a spot of trouble in the eighth, allowing an opposite-field home run to Sal Perez, followed by a single by Alex Gordon, but Aaron Sanchez put out the fire without further damage. Roberto Osuna pitched a perfect ninth to close it out.\nAfter a loss in Game 1 at Kansas City, Estrada was beating himself up for his lack of command and promised to be better in his next opportunity. He was not only better, he was extraordinary, striking out four, pitching to contact and getting tons of awkward swings from the Royals.\nNot only was Colabello the first player to score in this game, he was the only player on either team to advance beyond first base through the first five innings. He came to the plate in the bottom of the second with one out after Edwin Encarnacion had popped out to first.\nColabello looked at a strike, then swung right through Volquez’s second offering. With the count 0-2, Volquez tried to spoil Colabello’s timing with a changeup and the big first baseman was all over it, ripping it into the lower deck in left-centre for his second home run of these playoffs.\n“We definitely needed that,” said manager John Gibbons. “In a game like this, you score first, even though it was not a lot of runs, you can breathe a little easier. You’re not scrambling.”\nMeanwhile, Estrada was pitching the game of his life. An aspiring free agent, the meter on his next contract was spinning like a Las Vegas slot machine, the dollar values rising with every pitch. He was asked if, at any time Wednesday, he thought about this being his last game as a Blue Jay.\n“No,” he said. “That hasn’t crossed my mind at all. It didn’t cross it in Texas when we were down 2-0. It hasn’t crossed it now. Why would I put something like that in my head?\n“My only thought was to keep telling myself: ‘You’ve got to go nine innings today, try to shut them out, give these guys a chance to win.’ That’s all that’s going through my mind.”\nAfter retiring the first nine batters he faced, Estrada gave up a single to Alcides Escobar, leading off the fourth inning. Escobar was immediately erased on a 4-6-3 double play and the Estrada steamroller cruised on, killing the Royals softly. He erased nine more men in a row after that twin-killing before he issued a two-out walk to Lorenzo Cain in the seventh.\n“He’s got pinpoint control,” said Gibbons. “That’s a big part of his success and I thought he was sticking his fastball much better tonight.\n“He’s pitched like that all year. The fact that it was an elimination game, he really rose to the occasion. He’s a master at what he does. It doesn’t always look pretty, but he’s mastered it.”\nThe tense pitchers duel continued into the bottom of the sixth inning when Volquez finally blinked.\nHe walked Ben Revere to lead off, then plunked his old friend Josh Donaldson on the elbow. Jose Bautista followed with a terrific 10-pitch at-bat that included five consecutive foul balls before he looked at ball four, a close breaking ball that just missed.\nThat loaded the bases for Edwin Encarnacion, who also worked Volquez for a walk to drive in Toronto’s second run. That was it for Volquez. He handed the ball to reliever Kelvin Herrera. After he struck out Colabello, Tulowitzki stepped in and smashed the first pitch he saw, a 98-mph fastball, into the left-centre gap for a bases-clearing double to give Estrada some breathing room at 5-0.\n“Lately, I’ve been making some good swings,” said Tulowitzki, acknowledging his own struggles at the plate. “It’s a tough game and sometimes you go through some rough patches.”\n“I’m so happy for him.” said Colabello. “Big-time players step up in big-time moments and that’s the calibre of player he is.”\nBautista drove in a sixth run for Toronto in the seventh and Kevin Pillar drove in a seventh in the eighth.\nBefore Wednesday’s game, the Blue Jays had a massive obstacle ahead of them. Now the mountain is a bit smaller.\n“We’re all aware of where we are and how far we’ve come,” said Colabello. “Nobody here is ready to go home yet. We got down 2-0 in the first series and found a way to rally.\n“At this point, all we’re trying to do is get to the next game. You can’t overtake three games in one. If you think about it that way, it seems insurmountable. But if you play it one pitch at a time, one inning at a time, try to win each inning, win at-bats, it seems a lot more manageable. We did that today and now we’re going to K.C.”\nGame 5 is in the books and it’s on to Game 6. By now, the Blue Jays know better than to try to anticipate how it will all unfold.\nALCS Game 5, Blue Jays vs. Royals\n2 sec. 3 sec. 4 sec. 5 sec. 6 sec.
