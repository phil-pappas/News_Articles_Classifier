Hillsboro held steady at 386 students but saw an overall loss in district enrollment, which means the percentage of homeless students actually increased.\nBeaverton, as usual, had the highest number in the state with 1,380. The district has held the top spot for more than five years. It did not, however, have the highest percentage of students considered homeless, with about 3.5 percent. Gaston School District had the highest percentage of homeless kids in Washington County at nearly 9 percent, which was 48 students. Statewide, it was 3.6 percent.\nHomelessness comes in a variety of forms, including kids living from couch to couch, staying with relatives, sleeping in cars, in shelters or on the street.\nOnce a student is identified as homeless, the districts work to make sure he or she receives free breakfast and lunch at school, provide help finding a place to live, provide transportation assistance to the same school from wherever that new home may be, and other resources.\nDistrict homeless liaisons said they saw more families camping and living in motels last year because of the lack of permanent housing and that trend is continuing this school year.\nDistrict No. Homeless Percentage Banks SD 13 7 1 Beaverton SD 48J 1380 3 Forest Grove SD 15 100 2 Gaston SD 511J 48 9 Hillsboro SD 1J 386 2 Sherwood SD 88J 39 1 Tigard-Tualatin SD 23J 188 1 2141 \"We're seeing far more people unsheltered and living in hotels,\" said Lisa Mentesana, Beaverton School District homeless liaison. \"Daily we're getting calls that people can't find housing when they're moving to the area.\"\nThe same is true in Hillsboro and Tigard.\n\"Even if they have vouchers for housing, they can't find anything here,\" said Susan Stark Haydon, Tigard-Tualatin School District spokeswoman.\nFamilies living in tents and motels have jobs and cars, but affordable apartments are limited and other housing options are too costly.\nLiaisons in Beaverton and Hillsboro said parents have told them that landlords have given them notices to move, then renovated the apartments and increased the rent between $200 and $500 per month, which the families can't afford.\n\"Landlords are cherry-picking tenants because they can,\" Mentesana said.\nBoth women said they have a surprising number of people camping. Hillsboro has six families in tents and trailers. Beaverton has five families living in tents.\n\"Never in all the years I've been doing this have I seen this many people in tents,\" said Mentesana, who started in 2006.\nHousing is not part of a liaison's duties, but districts can give parents gasoline cards to drive their kids to school or send a school bus to their location. Most school districts also have connections with organizations that can provide food and clothing.\nBeaverton is assisting with passes to a recreation center so the camping families can shower, as well as giving them coins for laundry.\n\"We're putting out a call to action to provide them with tents and sleeping bags,\" she said.\nMentesana said it's going to take a community effort to resolve the housing shortage, from property management companies to local government and the school districts.\nAnd she's open to ideas.\n\"I'm encouraging the whole community to think about this in a creative way,\" she said, and offered her email address for suggestions.\n-- Wendy Owen\nwowen@oregonian.com\n@bvrtnreporter\n@wowen1\n503-294-5961", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/bvrtnreporter", "https://twitter.com/wowen1"], "published": "2015-10-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:31:53.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
