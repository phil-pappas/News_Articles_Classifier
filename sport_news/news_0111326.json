I don’t feel like I’m making a sacrifice not going to Alabama. We all feel good about my future and going to Notre Dame.\nRecruiting: Full coverage Signing Day 2016: Feb. 3 U-M football, hoops recruits MSU football, hoops recruits Photos: Michigan's 2016 football recruits Photos: MSU's 2016 football recruits Photos: 2015 Sound Mind Sound Body More recruiting news On Jan. 9, his parents, Phillicia and Ken, will drop him off in South Bend, Ind., and the plan is to make enough of an impression in winter conditioning and spring practice to get into the two-deep for the Fighting Irish.\nAn All-State player and Free Press Dream Team member a year ago, Kareem enters the playoffs with 16 sacks, 52 total tackles, 34 tackles for loss, five forced fumbles and four pass deflections. Ken Kareem keeps all of his son’s stats.\n“Academically we feel Notre Dame is a great place and, with the football history, it’s tough to deny it’s a great program,” said Ken Kareem.\nKhalid said there was nothing negative about the recruiting process, “just making the right decision was the key because it’s something that influences the rest of your life.”\nPlaying for Harrison and legendary coach John Herrington should have Kareem ready for the study part of playing college football.\n“We watched a ton of film,” said Kareem. “That’s one of the things that I will remember about playing for Coach Herrington. He made sure we watched film and were prepared.”\nContact Perry A. Farrell: 313-222-2555 or pafarrell@freepress.com.
