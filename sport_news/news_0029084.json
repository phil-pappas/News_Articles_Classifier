Manziel wasn't charged, and Crowley told police she didn't want to press charges against the former Heisman Trophy winner.\nUPDATE: Manziel, Crowley respond: 'We are all good'\nSgt. George Ruple told Northeast Ohio Media Group that alcohol was involved.\nRuple, who pulled Manziel over, said the quarterback told him he had only two drinks a little earlier in the day. Ruple said Manziel did not appear to be impaired.\nManziel spent 70 days in a Pennsylvania rehab facility during the offseason for treatment of an unspecified condition.\nBrowns general manager Ray Farmer released a statement Friday night.\n\"It is a matter that we take seriously and have expressed our concerns to Johnny directly,\" Farmer said. \"Those conversations will remain private and we will refrain from further comment at this time.\"\nManziel started and won one game for the Browns this season and is currently backing up starter Josh McCown. Manziel made two starts last year during a turbulent rookie season.\nAccording to the police report, officers noticed an abrasion on Crowley's arm, but said it was caused by Manziel restraining her from jumping from the car.\nBrowns linebacker Paul Kruger arrived at the scene while Manziel was being questioned.\nThe Browns had been impressed with Manziel's attitude and commitment this season. That wasn't the case during his rookie season when he struggled on and off the field, leading to speculation about the first-round pick's future.\nColleen and I got into a dumb public argument on the way home Monday afternoon. It probably looked more interesting than it was and...\n— Johnny Manziel (@JManziel2) October 16, 2015 I know I would stop and check if I saw a couple arguing on the side of the road. It was embarrassing but not serious...\n— Johnny Manziel (@JManziel2) October 16, 2015 and when we talked to the police and they realized everything was alright and I was sober, we went home together and everything is fine.\n— Johnny Manziel (@JManziel2) October 16, 2015\nBefore things get blown out of proportion.\nA photo posted by Colleen Crowley (@coll_crowley) on Oct 16, 2015 at 3:15pm PDT", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/p/86jZOzlA-y/", "https://twitter.com/JManziel2/status/655166174418870272", "https://twitter.com/JManziel2/status/655165925822480384", "https://twitter.com/JManziel2/status/655166124254994436", "http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2015/10/johnny_manziel_responds.html", "http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2015/10/johnny_manziel_pulled_over_by.html"], "published": "2015-10-17T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:41:19.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
