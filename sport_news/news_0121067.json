Rangers-Blue Jays, ALDS Game 2: 14 innings\nThe game began like a tit-for-tat between two siblings trying to one-up each other.\nTexas scored two in the top of the first, so Josh Donaldson blasted a homer in the bottom. Texas tacked on another run in the second, so Toronto responded with two of their own. But the game would stall at 4-4 after Mike Napoli's RBI single in the eighth.\nA hero eventually emerged in 22-year-old Hanser Alberto, who lined a game-winning single into right-center off Jays reliever LaTroy Hawkins in the top of the 14th. Texas would add one more run to make it 6-4, and Ross Ohlendorf struck out the sid to end the game.\nPhoto: Nathan Denette, Associated Press 9.

Dodgers-Red Sox, 1916 World Series Game 2: 14 innings\nBabe Ruth's legend began not as an otherworldly slugger in pinstripes, but as an imposing pitcher from Beantown.\nRuth would have scoffed at pitch counts and innings restrictions as much as he would have laughed at modern-day nutritionists. The Babe pitched all 14 innings of the Red Sox 2-1 win.\nThis would be the third of four Red Sox World Series titles in seven years — after 1918, they famously wouldn't win another until 2004.\nPhoto: Getty Images 8.

Yankees-Red Sox, 2004 ALCS Game 5: 14 innings\nSpeaking of 2004, it was looking like the Curse of the Bambino would prevail yet again after the Yankees took a 3-0 series lead. But something different was in the Boston air this night.\nWith the game tied 4-4 in the bottom of the 14th, David Ortiz walked to the plate with two outs and smacked a single off Esteban Loaiza to center field. Johnny Damon flew in from second base, the game-winning run.\nThis momentous victory proved to be a worthy precursor to an improbable run that would finally net Boston another World Series title.\nPhoto: AMY SANCETTA, AP 7.

Astros-White Sox, 2005 World Series Game 3: 14 innings\nThis was a particularly brutal World Series for the Astros. They were swept 4-0, but never lost a game by more than two runs.\nGame 3 might have been the metaphorical back-breaker in this series. Seventeen total pitchers threw 482 pitches, but it took just one misplaced ball from Astros reliever Ezequiel Astacio in the top of the 14th to decide the game.\nGeoff Blum smashed a solo home run off Astacio, another run walked in to push it to 7-5, then Mark Buehrle came in to shut it down with two-on and two-out.\nPhoto: MARK J.

The Yanks would lose the series 3-2, but they'd begin a run of four World Series title in five seasons the next year.\nPhoto: TIMOTHY CLARY, AFP/Getty Images 5.

Braves-Mets, 1999 NLCS Game 5: 15 innings\nGoing up against the Braves in the '90s meant pitching duels. 1-0. 2-1. 3-2. All were typical Braves box scores.\nThis matchup between NL East rivals didn't disappoint in that regard. The Mets had to use nine pitchers to keep up with Atlanta, who got seven quality innings out of Greg Maddux and stellar work from the bullpen.\nThe Mets hung around though, and with the bases loaded in the bottom of the 15th, Robin Ventura launched a ball that in all actuality was a grand slam, but only counted as a single since a mob of his teammates never allowed their man of the hour to reach home plate.\nPhoto: SUZANNE PLUNKETT, AP 4.

Astros-Mets, 1986 NLCS Game 6: 16 innings\nWe all know how things ended for the '86 Mets, how Mookie Wilson's dribbler slipped right through poor Bill Buckner's legs, how the Mets won their second World Series. But before they could get there, they had to survive a grueling 16-inning marathon in the Astrodome.\nBoth teams scored a run in the 14th, then the Mets scored three in the top of the 16th, but the Astros clawed in the bottom, getting two runs off Jesse Orosco before he finally stuck out Kevin Bass to end the game — and the series.\nPhoto: RAY STUBBLEBINE, AP 3.

Braves-Astros, 2005 NLDS Game 4: 18 innings\nThe Braves sure as hell made the Astros work to close out this series.\nDown 2-1 and on the verge of being eliminated from the playoffs, the Braves scored 6 runs in the first eight innings, but couldn't cross the plate over the final 10.\nChris Burke's walk-off homer ended the Braves' bid to stay alive and became the catalyst that drove Houston to its first World Series appearance.\nPhoto: ERIC GAY, AP 2.

Giants-Nationals, 2014 NLDS Game 2: 18 innings\nThis single 18-inning game provided what amounted to two game's worth of pitchers' duels. In 119 at bats, the Giants and Nats combined for 17 hits, a .143 batting average.\nEventually someone had to come through, and finally, in the top of the 18th, Brandon Belt belted the game-winning home run.\nSan Francisco would move through the NL and defeat Kansas City in the World Series for their third title in five years.\nPhoto: Alex Brandon, Associated Press 1.

Image 10 of 10 Rangers-Jays 14-inning game historic 1 / 10 Back to Gallery The Rangers' 6-4 14-inning victory over the Blue Jays was many things.\nLong. Angst-ridden. Exciting. Emotionally charged. Long.\nThe Rangers' top of the 14th charge behind Hanser Alberto — a 22-year-old rookie who hadn't recorded a hit since Aug. 30 and was using the wrong bat — might be the lasting legacy of this game, but like any extra-innings slog intensified by postseason play, there will be plenty to remember.\nBoth benches and bullpens briefly emptied in the bottom of the 13th when Josh Donaldson and Keone Kela engaged in a verbal spat after the Toronto slugger's deep fly went foul.\nThere was the controversial review involving Rougned Odor, who looked as if he had been thrown out out at second base after taking too wide of a turn.There appeared to be a sliver of light between Odor's foot and the bag as the tag was being applied, but the call was upheld and Odor remained at third to be driven in by Alberto on the very next play.\nAs these types of games tend to be, it was a devastating loss for Toronto and a momentum-shifting win for Texas.\nThe 14-inning marathon qualifies as the longest postseason game in Rangers history, and only the ninth in MLB history to go at least that deep.\nWith the Rangers' historic victory now in the books, here's a look at the company they've joined.\nClick through the slides to see the longest games in MLB postseason history.\nnmoyle@express-news.net\nTwitter: @NRmoyle", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/34/8767268/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/33/8767203/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/33/8767203/3/920x920.jpg", "http://news.nationalpost.com/sports/mlb/texas-rangers-hanser-alberto-borrows-a-bat-to-drive-in-winning-run-against-toronto-blue-jays", "https://twitter.com/NRMoyle", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/00/64/7605558/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/33/8767196/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/33/8767200/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/32/8767130/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/32/8767164/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/33/8767190/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/33/8767190/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/33/8767196/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/33/8767185/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/33/8767200/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/33/8767185/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/34/8767268/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/00/64/7605558/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/32/8767130/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/34/32/8767164/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T18:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:37:20.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
