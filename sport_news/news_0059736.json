(Courtesy of APD)\nThe only survivor of an alleged botched robbery that left three other alleged robbers dead last month has gone missing.\nIt’s a bizarre twist in an already bizarre story that began when Eduardo Ramirez-Llamas, 22, said he and three other men set out on Sept. 7 to rob Justin Mack, who lives on Washington near Gibson SE, police say.\nPolice said Llamas-Ramirez told them Mack was a drug dealer, and officers said they later found heroin and methamphetamine in his home. They charged him with drug trafficking, but those charges have since been dropped, according to online court records.\nThe alleged robbers wore masks and armed themselves with guns, before forcing their way into the home, according to a criminal complaint.\nAccording to police, Mack grabbed a gun and shot two of the robbers: Christopher Gonzalez, 18, and Joshua Valker, 25. Both men died.\nRamirez-Llamas fled to the car the group had arrived in and police found him near the crime scene pretending to be a witness, according to court documents.\nThe fourth alleged robber, identified in court records as Nicholas Leckey, was found a few blocks away, dead of a gunshot wound to his head. Police believe he committed suicide after the robbery.\nRamirez-Llamas was booked into the county jail, charged with armed robbery, among other things. Court records show he bonded out Sept. 9.\nOn Sept. 21, he had been at his apartment with his girlfriend and new baby. He left his apartment around 10 a.m. to go to the gym, his family told police.\nHis family hasn’t heard from him since.\nRamirez-Llamas’ sister Vanessa Ramirez said family members reported him missing the next day.\n“Everything was normal. He told his girlfriend he was going to go to the gym like always,” Ramirez said Tuesday. “After he left he never came back.”\nIt’s unclear if he ever made it to the gym.\nPolice began investigating the disappearance, and officers found his gym membership card, a broken bottle and his cell phone in the parking lot of his apartment building, next to his car.\nRamirez said he used that bottle for protein shakes.\nOfficer Tanner Tixier said police believe foul play could be involved in Ramirez-Llamas’ disappearance, or he could have staged his disappearance to abscond from the charges against him.\nHe hasn’t missed any court dates and the case against him is proceeding, Tixier said.\nRamirez-Llamas’ attorney is listed in court records as Thomas Clear. Clear didn’t respond to calls Tuesday.\nRamirez said she believes something sinister happened to her brother. She said she heard that someone wanted to kill him.\nTixier said officers have no evidence that someone wanted to kill Ramirez-Llamas because of the alleged robbery, but said it’s a possibility and one the reasons they are investigating his disappearance.\nMack has an arrest history dating back to 2009, but he has never been convicted of a felony, court records show.\nAfter Mack shot and killed the two alleged robbers, police searched his home and found two safes. When officers opened the safes they found more than two ounces of heroin and less than a gram of methamphetamine, according to a criminal complaint.\nMack was charged with two counts of drug trafficking, but those charges have since been dropped, according to online court records.\nRamirez said her family is distraught.\n“We’re just waiting to see what anyone can tell us,” Ramirez said. “We’ve tried talking to everyone who knows him, but no-one’s been able to tell us anything.”\nPolice have asked anyone with information to call 242-COPS or the missing persons unit at (505) 924-6095.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/eduardo-148x175.png"], "published": "2015-10-14T02:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:28:01.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
