Caddies offer detailed course knowledge including yardage and green reading and also handle clubs and flags, fill divots and rake bunkers. \n“We’ve been providing expert caddies to the most prestigious private clubs and golf destinations for 23 years,” said Dan Costello, vice president of sales and marketing for CaddieMaster. “We are assembling a team of highly vetted and trained caddies to complement the golf experience for players at Tiburόn and Ritz-Carlton guests.” \nTiburón Golf Club, offering two Greg Norman-designed golf courses, was carved from 800 acres of prime Southwest Florida real estate. The courses reflect Norman’s appreciation for pristine natural settings and his passion for great golf. The Black and The Gold courses contain a combination of stacked sod-wall bunkers and tricky coquina waste bunkers. \nTiburón features a 27,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style clubhouse with fine dining, private member locker rooms and lounge areas, and a fully-equipped golf shop. The member-only Fitness and Health Club offers a state-of-the-art cardiovascular and strength training equipment, a spacious aerobics room, massage treatment rooms, men’s and women’s locker rooms, steam rooms and a club room for private member functions. \nCertified as an Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary by Audubon International, Tiburón reflects a strong commitment to enhancing and protecting the natural resources. \nTiburón Golf Club at The Ritz-Carlton Golf Resort, Naples, annually hosts the Franklin Templeton Shootout, the LPGA CME TOUR Championship and is home to the Tiburon Golf Performance Group, featuring top industry professionals in golf instruction, custom club fitting and building, sports psychology and fitness. \nFor more information, call 239-593-2207 or visit www.TiburonGCNaples.com.
