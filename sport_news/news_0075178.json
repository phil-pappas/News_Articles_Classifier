But this time, the Wildcats have company.\nAdChoices Kentucky and North Carolina finished in a dead heat atop the coaches poll, a first in the preseason since USA TODAY began administering the poll in 1991. The Tar Heels have one more first-place vote — 12 to the Wildcats' 11 — but both teams wound up with a total of 749 poll points. It’s the first time since 2011 and fourth time overall that the Tar Heels are rated No. 1 by the coaches in the preseason poll.\nIf the balloting is any indication of the action to come on the court, this figures to be one of the most wide-open campaigns for the ultimate prize in some time.\nFive teams received at least one No. 1 vote, the most in a preseason poll since the 2004-05 season when there were eight. Maryland claimed five firsts and checks in at No. 3. Defending NCAA champion Duke will open at No. 4, picking up three No. 1’s. Rounding out the top five and claiming the remaining first-place nod is Kansas.\nIn addition to the Tar Heels and Blue Devils, Virginia checks in at No. 6 to give the Atlantic Coast Conference three representatives in the top 10. The Big 12 also had three with No. 7 Iowa State and No. 8 Oklahoma joining the Jayhawks.\nOverall the Big 12 has five clubs in the top 25, sharing the lead with the Big Ten. The ACC has four altogether, and the Pac-12 and SEC have three each. The Big East has a pair, with single ranked squads from the West Coast (No. 11 Gonzaga), the Missouri Valley (No. 12 Wichita State) and American (co-No. 24 Connecticut).\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:45:08.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
