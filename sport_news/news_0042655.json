They ran out their regular lineups and best available starting pitchers. Toronto’s Marco Estrada pitched well, but simply made more mistakes than Kansas City’s Edinson Volquez, whose pitches were darting and diving throughout his six innings. \nOn a chilly night in Kansas City, baseball’s best offence managed just a pair of singles off Volquez, and one more off three K.C. relievers. \nGibbons called the game “the Volquez show.” \n“His ball (was) ducking and darting everywhere,” Gibbons said. \nThe Jays’ batters love hard fastballs, and almost nothing Volquez threw was straight. On occasion, especially in the fourth inning, Toronto hitters thought the wrinkles on Volquez’s pitches were fooling umpire Tony Randazzo. Jose Bautista was especially vexed, openly displaying his displeasure on the field and in the dugout after taking three called strikes. But Randazzo’s calls were consistent and MLB’s Gameday pitch tracker found no fault with his strike zone. \nEdwin Encarnacion left the game after three at-bats after aggravating the left middle-finger injury that has bothered him off and on for much of the season. The Jays called it a ligament strain. X-rays were negative. Encarnacion is listed as day-to-day. \n*** \nKansas City scored twice off Estrada in the third on two doubles and a single. Salvador Perez hit a solo homer in the fourth. LaTroy Hawkins yielded the other two runs in the eighth. \nEstrada allowed three runs on six hits in 5.2 innings. He said he had difficulty locating his fastball, especially down in the strike zone. He also found himself in an unusual position: the Jays’ offence gave him no support. \n“The guys had some hard-hit balls, but they were right at people,” he said. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t get anything done today. It’s something we’re not used to. I’m not too worried about it.” \nChris Colabello hit three balls hard and had one single. \n“Perez’s ball barely snuck out,” he said. “Balls that went up in the air seemed like they weren’t carrying very much, but you’ve still got to approach your at-bats the same way.” \nThe series continues here Saturday at 4:07 ET, with Toronto’s David Price starting against Yordano Ventura. Price, an 18-game winner and the league’s ERA leader, has drawn a lot of attention for his post-season futility, summarized by a 5.06 ERA in 12 playoff games over six years. In the ALDS, he allowed eight earned runs in 10 innings. \n*** \nAfter the Jays fired Gibbons in mid-2008, ending his first managerial stint in the majors, the Royals new manager, Trey Hillman, hired Gibbons — an old friend — as bench coach the following season. Gibbons stayed on when Hillman was dismissed and Yost was hired in May 2010, and remained through Yost’s hard-headed phase. \n“I love Gibby,” Yost told reporters before Game 1. “You guys that work around Gibby know what kind of person he is. He’s a tremendous guy. He’s a funny guy. He’s a loose guy. He’s a very smart guy.” \nThe echo from Gibbons: “I love Ned. Ned took good care of me … He kept me around. And I loved my time here.” \nTheir personalities differ. Yost is not especially funny, nor particularly loose. But Gibbons said they are more similar than appearances indicate. \n“We have a lot of the same values,” Gibbons said. “We do a lot of things the same way. We take the same criticism a lot of times.” \nIn September, with the Royals heading to the World Series, Jerry Crasnick of ESPN.com wrote: “On the list of managers who are maligned by their team’s fan bases, Yost, Atlanta’s Fredi Gonzalez and Toronto’s John Gibbons probably win the gold, silver and bronze medals.” \nAs the Royals’ bench coach for three seasons, Gibbons saw the nucleus of the Royals’ current team reach the majors — no pitchers, but the position players comprised “some of the best young talent I’d ever seen,” he said. \nGeneral manager Dayton Moore built around the likes of Perez, Eric Hosmer and Mike Moustakas, and traded for up-and-comers Lorenzo Cain and Alcides Escobar, then went out and added the pitching that completed the puzzle. \nAnd Yost was the right man to bring the kids along, Gibbons said. \n“He’s done a tremendous job with this group,” Gibbons said. “One thing, they all came up young, and I probably never seen a guy that had as much patience and believed in his guys when they were young here, and he stuck by his guns, literally. And it’s paid off for him. \n“They went to the World Series last year. It could go either way this year.” © Copyright (c) National Post Original source article: Toronto Blue Jays shut out by Kansas City Royals in ALCS opener", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:39:24.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
