As a team we will do our best to put him in the right condition, building a group of riders around him.\"\nKittel's move was made possible after another top sprinter, Mark Cavendish of Britain, left to join African team MTN-Qhubeka who will be renamed Dimension Data next season.\nThe 27-year-old Kittel has eight Tour de France stage wins to his name. He missed most of this season because of a virus.\n(Reporting by Julien Pretot ; Editing by Tony Jimenez )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T14:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:23:17.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
