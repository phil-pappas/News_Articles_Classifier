He's playing really well. He's playing at a high level, and we've got a lot of confidence in him.\" \nHoyer made his second start this season on Sunday and it was the first time he both started and finished a game. \nHe won the starting job out of camp, but was benched during the season opener after struggling early in that game. But Mallett had a tough time in his three starts and Hoyer took over in the last two of them before regaining the starting job last week. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:05:20.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
