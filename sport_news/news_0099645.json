It's an unbelievable feeling,\" Friesen said. \"When we came around for four wide there at the beginning of the race and all the people that were here, it absolutely gave me chills. Crossing that stripe, I just can't believe it. If I never win another race or even get to run another race in my life I'm a happy camper.\"\nEarly on it looked like Larry Wight might become the youngest Syracuse 200 winner, but driveline failure sent him behind the wall after leading the first 49 laps. Billy Dunn, the 2013 winner, took over from there but lost the lead when he pitted, handing the top spot to 2004 winner Tim Fuller who surrendered the lead when he finally came down pit road on lap 112.\nMatt Sheppard, the 2009 winner, took over from there and led until Friesen passed Jimmy Phelps for second and then Sheppard for the lead in the same lap. Friesen credited his crew for the work they did on his final pit stop to tighten up his car.\n\"We weren't very good in the beginning,\" Friesen said. \"We pitted and took that second pit stop and really adjusted to the track conditions and then we were spot on. We could get rolling on the bottom and those guys were on the top. That was the key.\"\nSecond-place finisher Kenny Tremont noticed how good Friesen was in traffic as he tried to run him down with his late race charge.\n\"I just couldn't deal with the lapped cars. I just wasn't as maneuverable as Stewie,\" Tremont said. \"I tried the top but I just gave up too much ground. I knew where the bite was and there were some tight spots where you could actually hook up and put some throttle to it and go. And then there were some slippery spots you had to tip-toe through. All in all we had a great day.\"\nSaturday's winner Phelps spent most of the day in second spot until Tremont passed him with 27 laps to go, but inconsistency was an issue for him at times in the 200-lapper.\n\"There was a stretch there where we had some long runs when we were in second where I felt really good,\" Phelps said \"Then it just seemed like we got on a little of a stint there toward the end where I had to really creep it down into (turn) three and I'd get free. Then once it got better in three, (turns) one and two went away from me. I don't know. We had a great car. Tires just cycled around at the wrong time I guess and Stewart is on his game here.\"\nBut after his first Syracuse win the day before, he was not too disappointed with the outcome.\n\"We got the win last night and came back and actually raced for a win and ended up in the top three on the podium,\" Phelps said. \"We're tickled pink.\nEarlier in the day the Syracuse 200 winner's cousin James Michael Friesen won the 30-lap sportsman championship, leading all 30 laps. There have been 17 different winners in 17 sportsman races on the mile during Super DIRT Week.\nNew Yorker Rob Yetman prevented a Canadian sweep as led all but one lap on his way to a third straight win in the pro-stock championship. He led the first 23 laps until Adam found his way by in heavy lapped traffic to lead as the white flag waved. But that same traffic that helped Adam get the lead bit him on the final lap, allowing Yetman to get by on the backstretch and take the win.\nThe first and last lap of the final DIRT 200 at the fairgrounds The last DIRT 200 race at the fairgrounds was held on Sunday", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:04:56.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
