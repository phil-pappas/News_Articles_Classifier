The Eagles (6-1, 4-1) have done most of their damage on the ground this season, with Tyray Devezin and Trey Moore running behind a big offensive line, but Irwin said he has a plan to contain that.“When we’re on defense, we need to get them in passing situations,” he said. “When they’re able to run the ball effectively enough and throw with play action, it’s hard to tell whether they’re running or passing. If we can make them a little more predictable, that’s an advantage for us. If not, it’s going to be difficult to stop them, because they’ll throw it on running downs and vice versa.”Making that task more difficult for the Trojans is Patrick Ferris. The sophomore quarterback had a breakout game last week at Milton, completing 12 of 14 passes for 210 yards and three touchdowns.Lassiter will look to throw the ball, too, with Bradley Riopelle and Cooper Cross both seeing time at quarterback this season. Either could start tonight.“We’ll let it be a game-time decision,” Irwin said. “They both practiced well over the last two weeks, so we’re not going to say at this point. It’s always a possibility that we could see both of them.”Regardless of who plays quarterback, Svehla said his main concern comes from the playmakers Lassiter deploys on the outside.“Our defensive coaching staff has spent an awful lot of time in film getting us ready for this one,” he said. “Lassiter has some really, really good weapons. They have some really good receivers and some big bodies as well. They can catch the ball in traffic. It makes us nervous, but, hopefully, our kids will start out by recognizing formations, making sure we get lined up correctly and staying disciplined with our drops.”Irwin said he has confidence in either of his quarterbacks to utilize those weapons, but he knows Etowah is a hard team to beat for a largely one-dimensional offense.“I don’t think we can just line up and run the ball at them,” Irwin said. “I think we have to find our spots to try to run it. We’re going to have to be balanced. I don’t think we’re going to need a dominant running game, but we need to be able to mix one in every now and then.” — By Alex ResnakGame: Pope (0-6, 0-4) at Roswell (6-0, 4-0), 7:30 p.m. Last year: Roswell 44, Pope 21All-time series: Roswell leads 16-3Prediction: Roswell 48, Pope 10Pope will have its hands full tonight when it visits third-ranked Roswell for a Region 5 matchup at Ray Manus Stadium tonight.The teams couldn’t be more different, with the winless Greyhounds, averaging 11.5 points per game, going up against an undefeated Hornets team averaging 46.8 points. Defensively, Pope is allowing 44.3 points per outing and Roswell is holding teams to 7 per game.Tonight’s game appears to be a mismatch on paper in every conceivable way, but the Greyhounds don’t have any plans on switching things up in an attempt to try and find an advantage.“This week of practice has been no different than any other week,” Pope coach Kyle Adkins said. “(Roswell’s) a good team over there. They have playmakers all over the field and their coach is doing a great job with those guys. They’re a talented team, but we’re not treating this game any differently. It’s like any other game and we’re going to prepare like we have since the season started.”It’s been an adjustment process for Pope under its first-year coach. Adkins has also had to make adjustments in getting acclimated to his team and what they’re able to accomplish. The developing relationship has gone well so far.“I think the guys are adjusting well to the system and to my coaching style,” he said. “We graduated a great senior class last year that started a lot of games. We’re young this season and the guys are still working into being able to compete in this region.“Right now, our lack of body and size up front has caught up to us. This region has some incredibly large individuals to go with great coaching.”Most of the large individuals occupy the line of scrimmage, which is where Adkins believes games are won or lost.“It doesn’t matter who you run your offense or how you run your defense,” he said. “Whoever blocks and tackles the best and goes after the ball, usually wins.”— By Carlton D.
