Comment Posted Oct. 20, 2015 at 10:17 PM Updated at 10:42 PM Posted Oct. 20, 2015 at 10:17 PM Updated at 10:42 PM PORTLAND - On a wet and rainy Tuesday afternoon, Belding and Portland met at Portland High School for the Division 3, District 36 boy’s soccer opener. Belding came out with a 9-1 mercy victor over the host Raiders to move onto the next round of district play. The Raiders had trouble keeping up in the second half, only down 4-1 at the half. It was the lack of depth that hurt Portland in the end. “We moved the ball well in the first seven minutes,” said Portland head coach Chris Roof. “Guys get tired, so you’ve got to move people around, you lose your depth.” Belding had the lead right from the get-go, up 2-1 with 19 minutes to play in the first half. It stayed that way for awhile. It wasn’t until there was 6:16 left in the first half that Belding would tack on two more goals. On a penalty kick, senior Fabian Corona found the back of the net on a shot to the right of sophomore keeper Beau Rich. Just about three minutes later, sophomore Edgar Tovar found the back of tenet. On a crossing shot to the right of Rich on a pass from senior Chris Ornelas, Tovar rifled a shot four a 4-1 lead with just three minutes until the half. Senior Chris Ornelas scored just two minutes into the second half on a wicked shot from near midfield for a 5-1 lead. After that goal, Portland kept Belding off the board for the next 20 minutes of the second half and had some great chances of their own. Within the first 10 minutes, Portland had four opportune chances to shorten the lead, but two saves from junior keeper Jonathan Silva kept the three goal lead for Belding. Then with 20:58 left in the game, Tovar got his second goal of the game. A shot that found the left side of the net past Rich gave Belding a 6-1 lead. Tovar then scored with 18:31 to play on a goal that went through new keeper Charles Devlin, after replacing Rich due to an injury. It slipped through his hands as he did his best to keep the ball out of the net. Rich was then ok to go back in, but allowed the eighth goal just four minutes later. Tovar then ended the game with an easy shot that rolled past Rich as he tried to make the save in the final 10 minutes of the game. A 9-1 win mercy for Belding put them into the next round against Kentwood Grand River Prep. They defeated Wyoming Kelloggsville 6-1. Also in the district, Lakewood lost 8-0 to Grand Rapids South Christian and Wyoming Godwin Heights beat Grand Rapids West Michigan 3-1.

Only one senior is expected to be on the team next year and with a young core of sophomore and freshmen, should be able to start building a program that could include a junior varsity team next year.
