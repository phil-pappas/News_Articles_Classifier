Lions, during which they outscored the Leos 20-3 in the second half. Winnipeg will be making one roster change. C Dominic Picard is out after suffering an unknown injury last week against B.C. Matthias Goossen will start in his place, and Tommy Griffiths will come on the roster to serve as the sixth offensive lineman. The Bombers had a season few 43 penalty yards in last week's win over the Lions. Field goal kicker Sergio Castillo was 5-for-5 in his pro debut last week, and he was the first Bomber to kick a game-winner as time expired since Troy Westwood did it against Saskatchewan on July 10, 2003. Winnipeg's last three games have been decided by three points or fewer. \nOttawa RedBlacks The RedBlacks are coming off a 38-35 loss to the Toronto Argonauts on Oct. 6 at TD Place. This will be the fourth straight home game for Ottawa, even though it was technically the road team last week against Toronto. The RedBlacks will make five roster changes. In are P Ronnie Pfeffer, S Jeff Richards, LB Nick Rosamonda, WR Reggie Dunn and LB Jordan Verdone. Out are RB Jeremiah Johnson, DE Ettore Lattanzio, DE Marlon Smith, DT Justin Phillips and P Brett Maher (released). Ottawa pummelled Winnipeg 42-20 in their meeting last year at TD Place. It was one of only two RedBlacks victories in their inaugural campaign. Quarterback Henry Burris is attempting to become the oldest quarterback in league history to lead the league in passing yards. He would be 40 years and six months if he can do it, breaking Anthony Calvillo's record of 39 years and three months. \nTHE BIG MATCHUP \nRedBlacks front four vs. Bombers offensive line \nOttawa has a league leading 45 sacks, and Winnipeg will be without veteran centre Dominic Picard, who is out with an unknown injury. Matthias Goossen will make his second career start and will have to make the correct calls at the line of scrimmage to ensure Matt Nichols survives the contest. \nBY THE NUMBERS \n68-10 — Ottawa's points for and against in the third quarter of its last seven games \n381 — Passing yards needed for Henry Burris to reach 60,000 in his career Winnipeg \nComp Att Yds TD INT \nNichols 231 388 2,693 13 12 \nRECEIVERS \nRec Yds Avg Long TD \nMoore 62 742 12.0 64 2 \nAdams 45 649 14.4 79 3 \nDenmark 47 593 12.6 75 2 \nRUSHERS \nAtt Yds Avg Long TD \nMarshall 109 466 4.3 26 4 \nNichols 14 88 6.3 23 0 Ottawa \nComp Att Yds TD INT \nBurris 373 521 4,365 18 9 \nRECEIVERS \nRec Yds Avg Long TD \nWilliams 63 919 14.6 84 3 \nSinopoli 70 863 12.3 33 2 \nJackson 65 839 12.9 55 5 \nRUSHERS \nAtt Yds Avg Long TD \nBurris 57 224 3.9 14 6 \nPowell 10 55 5.5 10 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:16:02.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
