Source: Getty Images\nRiley says she was worried at the time that her husband would be caught match-fixing as there were many players involved and Vincent “had a tendency to talk to anyone who listened.”\nAccording to Riley, Cairns assured her there was no way they would get caught because “everyone was doing it in India”.\nCairns’ lawyer, Orlando Pownall QC, questioned whether Riley might have ulterior motives for testifying against his client.\nHowever Riley said she and Vincent did not part on good terms and that “I certainly wouldn’t come to a perjury trial to lie”.\nShe also counteracted suggestions that her memory was hazy due to alcohol by saying, “When I’ve had a large meal it doesn’t matter how much I drink, I’m as clear as a bell.”\nRiley didn’t let her ex-husband off the hook during her testimony, admitting Vincent “hated Chris Cairns” because he believed he owed him money.\nFormer New Zealand cricketer Chris Cairns. Source: AP\nShe also said Vincent gave his explosive evidence in the hope it would allow him to escape charges he himself faced for match fixing.\nIn her evidence, Riley detailed the first occasion Vincent admitted to her that he had been involved in match fixing during the now-defunct Indian Cricket League.\n“He was crying,” Riley said. “He told me that he had lied, that he had taken the money for the match-fixing.\n“He told me that he had stuffed a game up. He just hadn’t played how he was supposed to play.\n“He said that he was working with Chris - Chris Cairns.”\nLast week, Vincent, together with current New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum and bowling coach Shane Bond, gave testimony that they either knew or believed Cairns had been involved in match fixing.\nFormer Australia captain Ricky Ponting is due to give evidence in the trial soon.\nKilling the Ball: Inside Matchfixing 26:01 Play video\nAn investigation into how a match-fixer and his syndicate corrupted global football from amateur matches, through professional leagues and all the way to the FIFA World Cup.\nOovvuu 29 May 2015 TV/Crime TV/Current Affairs TV/Sport More stunning allegations in Cairns trial", "external_links": ["http://resources1.news.com.au/images/2015/10/20/1227575/421517-9c411f2a-76bc-11e5-8562-88a509acffad.jpg", "http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2015/10/20/1227575/420242-8d06f282-76bc-11e5-8562-88a509acffad.jpg", "http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/chris-cairns-trial-lou-vincents-ex-wife-gives-stunning-testimony-in-london-court/story-e6frf3g3-1227575421571", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http://videomam.news.com.au.s3.amazonaws.com/generated/prod/05/29/2015/122445/image1024x768.jpg?count=3&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc"], "published": "2015-10-20T19:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:37:21.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
