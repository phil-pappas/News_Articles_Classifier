But thanks to a second-half comeback, now the Hilltoppers' regular-season finale on Friday night at home against Bow is going to mean a heck of a lot more. Somersworth rallied from a five-point halftime deficit and a 10-point hole early in the fourth quarter to save its season with a 28-24 win at Division III rival Epping-Newmarket on Saturday. \"This was such a big game, for me especially, because I'm a senior,\" said Somersworth quarterback Matt Menz. \"To have a chance at the playoffs, that's awesome.\" Menz ran for 94 yards on 20 carries with three touchdowns. Ray Mills scored the winning touchdown with 4:51 to go in the game, rumbling in from 15 yards out to put the Hilltoppers up 27-24. Will Paradis-Collins drilled the fourth of his four extra-point attempts on the day to make it 28-24. \"I was going up the middle, I was hit, and I spun out of it, and I kind of walked up the middle,\" said Mills, who ran for 85 yards on 21 carries. \"No one stopped me.\" Epping-Newmarket went three-and-out on its next possession, and Somersworth sealed the win when Connor Santos landed on a fumbled punt return for the home team's third turnover of the day with 1:58 to go. From there, the Hilltoppers ran out the clock. \"We weren't good in the first half,\" Somersworth coach Dan Hodsdon said. \"We were better in the second half. I mean, it's the little things that make big differences, and we were able to secure those little things in the second half.\" Menz and Travis Perrin each blocked an Epping-Newmarket extra point, and the Blue Devils failed on a pair of 2-point conversion attempts. The failed conversions proved to be the difference in the game. \"Earlier in the year, those were situations where we found ourselves on the other side of,\" Hodsdon said. \"We finally found a kicking game, and those points in these big games are huge. Will's done a really nice job.\" Somersworth improved to 4-3 and will be in the playoffs with a win over Bow (6-1) on Friday. The loss bumped Epping-Newmarket (2-5) from the playoff chase. \"Menz took over in the second half,\" Epping-Newmarket coach Justin Leonard said. \"And they made some good halftime adjustments. He made a lot of good cuts and they continuously dragged our tacklers. We'd make contact, they'd drag us another 2, 3 yards.\" The Blue Devils scored on the first offensive snap of the game when Jake Bisaillion threw a lateral to George Bradley, who heaved the ball down field and hit a wide-open Noah Armstrong in stride for a 57-yard touchdown and a 6-0 lead just 16 seconds into the game. Somersworth went three-and-out on its first drive, but Aiden Anderson intercepted a Bisaillion pass to give the Hilltoppers the ball at Epping-Newmarket's 27-yard line. Eight plays later, Menz ran 8 yards for a score, giving the visitors a 7-6 lead. Armstrong returned the ensuing kickoff to the 50-yard line, and the Blue Devils scored seven plays later on a 3-yard scramble by Jeremy Espo for a 12-7 Blue Devil lead. The Hilltoppers got the ball all the way to the Epping-Newmarket 11-yard line just before halftime, but a Menz pass on 4th-and-8 was intercepted by Armstrong in the end zone with 10 seconds to go in the half. Epping-Newmarket led 12-7 at the break. The Blue Devils scored on their first possession of the second half, this time a 33-yard run by Espo to expand the home team's lead to 18-7. A lengthy Somersworth drive — which included Menz scrambling 4 yards on a fake punt on fourth down — ended with a Menz touchdowns, this time from 3 yards out to pull within four at 18-14 with 9:33 to go in the fourth quarter. Any excitement on the Somersworth sideline was soon quashed when Armstrong took the ensuing kickoff the distance for a touchdown, and the Blue Devils led 24-14 with 9:19 to go. Menz wasted no time on the Hilltoppers' next drive when he ran 65 yards for a score on second down, cutting Epping-Newmarket's lead to 24-21 and capping a wild 1:18 sequence in which three touchdowns were scored. Somersworth forced the Blue Devils three-and-out on their next drive (highlighted by a monster sack by Kiki Oroh), setting the stage for Mills and his game-winning touchdown. Epping-Newmarket finishes its season next Saturday at home against Farmington-Nute.
