Trends suggest voters may send more Punjabis to the House of Commons than Punjab sends to Indian Parliament. As many as 44 Indo-Canadians are in the fray, of whom 36 are Punjabis. The number of members in the House of Commons has been revised from 308 to 338 this time. In 2008, record 10 Punjabis were elected to Canadian parliament while the number came down to eight in 2011. Punjabis are pitted against each other in around 10 ridings (constituencies). Edmonton-based editor of Asian Times Dr Prithvi Kalia says he expects 16 to 18 Indo-Canadians to get elected this time of whom 15 could be Punjabis. Punjabis have made enough space for themselves in all three parties — Conservatives (Right Wing), Liberals (Centre of the Left) and New Democratic Party (Left). The New Democratic Party has fielded 10 Indo-Canadians, Liberals 20 and Conservatives 14 candidates. They have made their presence felt in cities such as Calgary, Brampton, Abbotsford, Surrey, Kamloops and Mississauga. The approach of all three parties is almost identical on a number of issues, including military ties with the US. The dominant issue this time remains right wing and pro-corporate agenda, says Kalia. Mounting poverty and social inequality have been put on the back burner even by parties having Left leaning. Over the years, 19 Punjabis, some of them repeatedly, have become members of Parliament and ministers in the Federal Government. They have been elected members mostly of Provincial Assemblies such as British Columbia, Ontario, and Alberta. Ujjal Dosanjh created history by serving as the Premier of the British Columbia from 2000 to 2001. In 2011, eight Punjabis — Parm Gill, Bal Gosal, Nina Grewal, Tim Uppal, Deepak Obhrai, Devinder Shorey, Jasbir Sandhu and Jinny Sims — were elected to Canadian parliament. Bal Gosal and Tim Uppal were ministers in the outgoing Stephen Harper government. Among prominent losers in 2011 were: Ujjal Dosanjh, Ruby Dhalla, Gurbax Malhi, Navdeep Bains and Sukh Dhaliwal. Malhi became the first turbaned Sikh to be elected a Liberal MP in 1993 from Bramalea-Gore-Malton riding. He remained MP for 18 years. He has quit active politics and his daughter Harinder Malhi is now a Liberal Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP or MLA) from Brampton-Springdale, otherwise known as “Singhdale” because of large concentration of Sikhs. Gurbax Malhi says Canada provides ample opportunities to its citizens. Due to large concentration of Punjabi population, there are about 10 constituencies where the three main parties have fielded Punjabi candidates. Key contest is among Tim Uppal, Amarjit Sohi and Jasvir Deol in Edmonton-Mill Woods; Devinder Shorey, Darshan Kang and Sahajvir Singh Randhawa in Calgary-Skyview riding; Sukh Dhaliwal, Jinny Sims and Harpreet Singh in Surrey-Newton; and Naval Bajaj, Raj Grewal and Harbaljit Kahlon in Brampton East. In Brampton North, Param Gill, Ruby Sahota and Martin Singh are in race. Martin is a white-turned-Sikh and is married to a Sikh woman from Amritsar. In Vancouver South, Harjit Sajjan and Amandeep Nijjar besides Wai Young, a candidate of Chinese origin, are in race. Sajjan, a Liberal candidate, is a Lieutenant Colonel who served the Canadian Army in Afghanistan. He has taken leave from the army to contest the election. “In the election campaign, I cannot use my army background and rank to have any electoral benefit. That is condition one has to abide by to contest the election if one is serving in the army in Canada,” said Sajjan. Shaky Canadian economy remains a big issue in these elections. Following a fall in oil prices in the international market, the country is facing closure of oil operations at many places leading to layoffs. Another issue is balance budget or deficit budget. Conservatives and the NDP have promised balanced budget while Liberals are offering deficit budget and securing of loans to start new infrastructure projects to generate employment. Liberals are currently leading the popularity charts because of their deficit budget stand. The recent passage of C24 Bill by Parliament has unnerved immigrants, including Punjabis. Under the law, new immigrants will have to wait longer, probably eight to 10 years instead of earlier four to six years to acquire citizenship apart from paying higher fee. It also allows the government to take away the citizenship if an individual is perceived to be a threat to national security. Another Bill, C-51, makes promotion of terrorism an offence and allows police to arrest anyone without warrant. Harry Bains, a trade unionist and a NDP MLA from Surrey-Newton says PM Stephen Harper is facing criticism for damaging the neutral image of Canada by becoming a part of the American Bloc. The passage of C-24 and C-51 Bills has violated the Canadian Charter of Rights.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:10:13.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
