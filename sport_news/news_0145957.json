Tuukka Rask was outstanding for the B’s. In just his second start of the exhibition season, Rask stopped all 15 shots he faced in two periods of work, including four clean breakaways and various other dangerous chances.\nAlex Ovechkin’s in-close goal on Jeremy Smith tied the game, 1-1, with 2:34 left. After a scoreless OT which saw chances at both ends and a B’s power play, the Caps scored on the first two shots of the shootout (T.J. Oshie, Evgeni Kuznetsov), while Ryan Spooner and David Krejci were stopped, giving the home team the 2-1 win. The Bruins’ lone goal was from Loui Eriksson, set up at the goalmouth by Patrice Bergeron in Period 1.\nRask didn’t see a ton of shots, but most were were high-quality bids. He was very pleased with his game.\n“It really felt like there were no easy shots,” said Rask. “There were a lot of scoring chances. Obviously we made a lot of uncharacteristic things out there, giving up those breakaways especially. But it was fine. I felt great. I felt calm and I was reading the play and seeing the puck very well.\nThe Bruins used the top three lines they’re expected to employ in the season-opener: Patrice Bergeron centering Brad Marchand and Loui Eriksson, David Krejci between David Pastrnak and Matt Beleskey, and Ryan Spooner joined by Jimmy Hayes and Brett Connelly. The No. 4 trio had Joonas Kemppainen in the middle with Chris Kelly and Tyler Randell, which also could be the plan for Thursday. The scratches were Max Talbot and Zach Trotman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:58:59.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
