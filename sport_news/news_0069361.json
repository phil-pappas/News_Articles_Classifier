It's thet first NLCS since 2007 without the St. Louis Cardinals, Los Angeles Dodgers or San Francisco Giants, precisely the sort of fresh blood neutral fans crave in the postseason.\nFor the Mets, it's about the young pitching. The team's four postseason starters - Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard, Matt Harvey and Steven Matz - have an average age of 25 and in the Division Series, combined for 42 strikeouts in 30 ⅓ innings. That's not to mention closer Jeurys Familia, who tossed 5 ⅓ perfect innings in the series.\nMeanwhile, the Cubs got nine home runs the division series from players aged 26 or younger. Anthony Rizzo, Kris Bryant and Kyle Schwarber are the big names, but Chicago is getting contributions from some of its lesser-known youngsters like Jorge Soler and Javier Baez.\nAces vs. sluggers.\nWhile some of these players are already bona fide stars, we may point back to the 2015 NLCS as the point we witnessed several more come of age.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAftJTU.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfsIBi.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfqA7S.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Who", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfvHai.img&quot;}}", "http://vamp.csprt-origin.com/msn-sports-video/raw_rss.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;baseball_mlb&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Blue", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Rangers", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Who"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:24:35.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
