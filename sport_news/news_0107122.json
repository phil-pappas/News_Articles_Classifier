Ward, Aqib Talib, Darian Stewart, Chris Harris Jr. and Bradley Roby around, but he's been exactly that so far. \nAfter being named special teams captain again this summer, Bruton has made a big play on defense in each of Denver's three wins so far. \n\"It's been awesome, hasn't it?\" coach Gary Kubiak said. \"I know as a coach, I haven't been around him long, but it's been special. I came here, he's been a backup, he's been a special teams player, he's been a captain, but yeah, has he played well defensively. \n\"He's a great example of a pro who continues to stay the course and battle and thinks of himself as a starter and not just a special teams player. It has really showed up. We're only three weeks deep and he has been a factor in every week. (I'm) just very proud of David. He's a leader on the team and doing a great job.\" \nIn the opener, he broke up Joe Flacco's pass to tight end Crockett Gillmore that Stewart snatched away for a game-ending interception in the final seconds that sealed Denver's 19-13 win over the Ravens. \nAt Kansas City the following week, Bruton punched the football from Jamaal Charles' grasp at the Denver 6, the first of five takeaways in Denver's 31-24 victory. \nAnd last week at Detroit, he snared Matt Stafford's pass at midfield intended for Calvin Johnson with the Broncos clinging to a 17-12 lead with 3:37 remaining and the Broncos drove down for an insurance touchdown. \n\"He got some experience last year in our nickel and dime packages and now he's really put it all together,\" linebacker Brandon Marshall said. \nBruton said he figured he'd parlay his increased playing time on defense last season with a new coaching staff to get a fresh shot at earning a bigger role in 2015. \n\"I've been heralded as a special teams guy for years and I can't necessarily downplay it. I've been here in the league and here with the Broncos for that reason for so long,\" Bruton said. \"Having a fresh set of eyes, going out there and competing and still building on what I started last year, it's great. I'm relishing the opportunity and the moments and taking full advantage of any chance that I get.\" \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nFollow AP Pro Football Writer Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T08:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:05:44.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
