have finally seen the light at a time when it appeared there was no light at the end of the tunnel, the team looking completely lost and disjointed with two games to prepare for the post-season. \nIn the CFL, only the absolute inept fail to qualify for the playoffs and while the Argos aren’t exactly in that lower-tier class, their play of late has inspired no one. \nQuarterback Ricky Ray isn’t going to suddenly make this team block better, pressure the quarterback better, turn a team that is fighting among themselves into a disciplined, more detail-oriented group, but the Argos need to know what they’ve got in Ray and what exactly can be extracted before the playoffs begin. \nThey got a glimpse in Friday night’s 34-2 embarrassment at the hands of the Montreal Alouettes and now they’ll be able to better assess their quarterback position. \nBy no means should Trevor Harris take the fall for an offence that produced one touchdown in back-to-back losses to Calgary and Montreal because there’s plenty of blame to be spread. \nIn a passing league on an Argos team whose identity is its passing offence, a change was needed and in steps Ray, who will start this Friday night against visiting B.C. when the Scullers play their first home game in Toronto since Sept. 11 and next week against visiting Winnipeg. \nThe Argos can’t finish first in the tightly grouped East Division with Hamilton and Ottawa concluding the regular season with a home-and-home matchup. \nThe Argos, currently third, can finish second and play host to the East semifinal. \nWhen they won the Grey Cup in 2012, Ray and the offence found its rhythm in the next-to-last game of the season, went on to host the semi and then went into Montreal to upset the Alouettes. \nThis year’s Argos team isn’t as talented as the 2012 edition and a fight that broke out during practice last week coupled with players losing their cool along the bench during the game would suggest this team is nowhere near as close-knit as the 2012 title version. \nThe one constant is Ray, who last started a game in the 2014’s penultimate kickoff in Montreal when John Bowman delivered a blow that would knock Ray out with a concussion. \nOff-season shoulder surgery then put in doubt Ray’s return, but he’s battled back and he’ll now take the first-team reps when the Argos resume practising on Monday. \nIf he protects the football and runs the offence with efficiency, there’s no way the Argos won’t start Ray in the playoffs. \nIf he can’t make every throw and force defences to honour the deep ball, Harris then will step back in. \nIf Harris continues to struggle like he has in his past two appearances, then the Argos have a deeper problem at quarterback, with both Harris and Ray eligible for free agency. \nAt one point, the Argos thought they had two starters and were looking at losing one to free agency, much like they lost Zach Collaros to Hamilton in 2014. \nThere were great late-game drives Harris produced in Regina and Ottawa, a five-touchdown performance, stretches of accuracy and high-end quarterback play that had many talking about Toronto’s fourth-year player as a potential candidate for the league’s MOP award. \nBut he’s hit a rut, much like the entire Argos team in all three phases. \nHead coach Scott Milanovich said on Sunday he decided to turn to Ray hours following his team’s beatdown by the Als in Hamilton, where the Double Blue have now lost five games in five visits. \nHe first spoke with Ray and then Harris. \n“This is hard,’’ said Milanovich. “I don’t know if there’s a right decision in this case. A big part of me feels for Trevor when I spoke with him (on Saturday). I’ve been on the other side of that conversation and it’s hard. \n“It’s undeniable that we’re not in this situation we’re in without the way (Harris) has played. It’s just a difficult situation for all and the good thing for the team is that we’ve got two good quarterbacks. That’s where we’re at.” \nThe Boatmen need to find out where Ray is at and now is the perfect time to evaluate their future hall of famer with two games left, two games indoors where the weather won’t be a factor. \n“We need to find out what Ricky is capable of doing before we get into the playoffs and then we, I, make the decision as to who gives us the best chance to advance when we get there,’’ added Milanovich. \nRay’s experience helped him on Friday when he entered the game late in the third quarter. \nHe knows the system and said he felt no discomfort on Saturday after throwing for the first time in a real game in almost one full calendar year. \nRay basically played with one arm last year and should have won the league’s MOP, throwing to a receiving group that had no consistency in the wake of injuries. \n“I’m good enough to play,’’ said Ray. “That’s all that matters. At this point it doesn’t do me any good to think about where I’m at, what I can do, what I can’t do. I’m just going to go out there and play and do my best, try to do whatever I can to help this team win.” \nHarris has thrown for a league-high 32 touchdowns, but his 18 picks also lead the CFL, including nine games in a row in which an opponent has recorded an interception. \n“As a competitor you obviously want to be out there and you want to compete,’’ said Harris. “Any time you’re taken off the field it’s a little disappointing, but at the same time I don’t play for Trevor Harris. I play for the Toronto Argonauts and I believe in who we have at the top and that’s what it comes down to. I believe in what we have here and now that we’re in the playoffs I believe we’re going to start catapulting.” \nPerhaps, but in two straight weeks it’s been more a case of capitulation and incompetence. \nARGOS BENCHING RECEIVER TORI GURLEY \nNo one should ever and likely will never criticize Scott Milanovich for not doing the right thing, no matter which player is being disciplined or shown the door. \nA few weeks ago, he sat out Vidal Hazelton when Toronto’s first-year receiver repeatedly lost his composure on the field. \nThis time it’s Tori Gurley, who leads the Argos with 791 receiving yards and leads all receivers in the CFL with 10 touchdowns. \nThere are several highly competitive players on the Argos who at times don’t know how to channel their frustrations. \nIt got out of hand Friday night in The Hammer, where the Double Blue were hammered by the Alouettes. \nShortly after he named Ricky Ray as his starter for this week’s game against B.C., Milanovich announced his decision to not play Gurley against the Lions. \n“Third time now where he (Gurley) exhibited behaviour on the sidelines I consider to be not acceptable,’’ said Milanovich. “He will not be available this week.” \nPlayers know where they stand with Milanovich, who commands attention and demands a lot. \n“I like Tori,’’ he said. “It’s no different with Vidal, but there’s a place where you have to draw a line in the sand.” \nMilanovich wasn’t about to play the role of sporting psychiatrist in analyzing his players. \n“The one thing I will say about both of them is that I think they are good people, good teammates with good hearts,’’ said Milanovich. “They are also extremely competitive and some of that needs to be harnessed a bit.” \nDepending on the ratio, the obvious move is to insert Diontae Spencer, the odd-man out Friday. \nHARRIS NOT BITTER ABOUT SITTING \nQuarterback Trevor Harris was coming off a five-touchdown game, coming off a night when he helped the Argonauts sweep the Ottawa RedBlacks and to boot he did throw for close to 400 yards. \nThen came an efficient game in Montreal, where the Argos would win their third in a row to position themselves to battle for first and a potential bye into the East Division final. \nAll of a sudden, things turned south in losses to Calgary, where the offence never crossed midfield in the opening half. \nIt hit rock bottom a week later against the Als in Hamilton. \nAnd now comes the decision to turn to Ricky Ray at quarterback. \nAlways a stand-up guy, Harris didn’t offer any excuses when asked on Sunday to assess his performance the past two weeks. \n“Struggled a little bit as you can see,’’ he said. “It’s been tough, but it’s a long season and there are always things you can improve on, even early in the season when things are going well and everyone is saying good things about you, but there are still things to improve on. \n“It’s all part of the learning process and obviously I’ve got to take whatever comes in stride and make myself a better quarterback.” \nThe biggest knock of late has been his decision-making, which invariably leads to a turnover. \nHarris has got away with poor throws because the Argos came up with big plays on defence or on special teams. \nAnd to his credit, when a game needed to be won Harris drove the team on late scores this season. \nIn some ways, Harris was trying to do more when so little was being produced, be it no run game, no big plays on defence, no big returns, or at least those returns that weren’t being called back on a penalty.
