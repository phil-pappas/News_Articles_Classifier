But the second half saw South Africa score eight tries — including Habana’s treble and more to Bismarck Du Plessis, Jesse Kriel, Lwazi Mvovo and two from Francois Louw — as they added 50 more points.\n“The first half we couldn’t get going and made one or two errors, but the second-half performance was as polished as I’ve been involved in with a Bok team,” said Habana, a veteran of 114 Tests.\n“As nice as it is to score tries, we can be really proud of our defensive effort,” added Habana, who helped French club Toulon win the last two European Cups.\nThe loser of the Pool A game between Australia and Wales on Sunday morning (AEDT) at Twickenham will play South Africa in a quarter-final. Habana could have beaten Lomu’s record but, with 13 minutes left, he botched what would have been his fourth try with a knock-on.\nSouth Africa coach Heyneke Meyer added: “I am so proud of Bryan, as a player and human.\n“He is a great ambassador for South Africa, has peaked at the right time and we need him.”\nSouth Africa captain Fourie du Preez described Habana as “a great finisher”.\nAFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:46:32.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
