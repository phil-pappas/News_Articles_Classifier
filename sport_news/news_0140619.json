(AP) \nIt was all there for the taking for the Blue Jays. Game 6 of the ALCS against the Royals in Kansas City. Ninth inning. Trailing by one run -- but with a rally brewing. \nRussell Martin singled to center off Royals closer Wade Davis, who was back in the game after a 45-minute rain delay (he had already worked part of the eighth inning for Kansas City). Dalton Pompey came in as a pinch runner for Martin and promptly stole second ... then stole third. Nobody out. Runner 90 feet away. \nAfter Davis issued a walk to Kevin Pillar, Dioner Navarro struck out, but Pillar took second on the strike-three pitch to put two runners in scoring position. Still just one out. Ben Revere -- acquired at the trade deadline to give Toronto a contact hitter at the top of the lineup -- then struck out swinging, which brought up Josh Donaldson. But the American League MVP Award candidate grounded out to third for the final out. The Majors' best offense failed to deliver. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nThe Jays finished 0-for-12 with runners in scoring position in Game 6, losing 4-3 in a game that included a brief rain delay, and ultimately, an anti-climatic ending for the AL East champs. \nPrior to the game, John Gibbons was asked about what the Jays -- who scored a combined three runs in the first two games of the series at Kauffman Stadium, both losses -- could do in order to manufacture more offense. \n\"I don't know. Bunt more?\" the Jays manager joked. \nToronto wasted opportunities all night, but relied once again on its right fielder to give the team a chance to force a Game 7 on Saturday. With one out in the eighth inning, Bautista hit a game-tying two-run homer off Royals reliever Ryan Madson, becoming the first Blue Jay ever to hit two home runs in a single postseason game. It was just the sixth time since the start of the 2014 season Kansas City has given up a lead of two or more runs in the eighth inning or later. And then, the rain came before play resumed in the bottom of the eighth, when Lorenzo Cain scored from first base on an Eric Hosmer single to put the Royals ahead once more heading into the ninth. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nEven before all of the back-and-forth in the final two innings, this Game 6 had its share of dramatic moments. The storyline heading into Toronto's fifth elimination game of these playoffs was all about starter David Price, who took the mound for perhaps the final time in a Jays uniform, with an 0-7 record as a postseason starter. A familiar script played out early, as Price allowed solo home runs to Ben Zobrist and Mike Moustakas -- the latter of which initiated a review (the call stood) and turned a Royals fan in right field into a celebrity, albeit for 15 minutes or less -- as the Royals raced out to a 2-0 lead. But Price settled down after that, and left with two outs in the sixth inning after striking out eight while allowing five hits and three runs. The Royals went to their bullpen in the sixth after 5.1 innings from Yordano Ventura, who stared down Troy Tulowitzki after a strikeout to end the fourth and jawed with Jays first base coach Tim Leiper after he was pulled from the game. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \n\"I hope that quiets some things down for David,\" Gibbons said afterwards. \"Like I said before, he's having a great career, he's going to go on to have an even better career. He stepped up tonight.\" \nThe Jays battled back all night, in an effort that was indicative of their postseason run. Remember that this team came back and won three straight against Texas in the ALDS after losing the first two games at home, and then fell behind in the seventh inning of the deciding fifth game of that series on a disputed call that allowed the Rangers to score a go-ahead run. \nAgainst the Royals, the Jays again lost the first two games of the series, with Game 2 an especially painful loss after taking a 3-0 lead into the seventh inning. They fell behind 3-1 after a 14-2 defeat at home in Game 4, but forced a trip back to Kansas City, and left two runners in scoring position in the ninth, in a game that they will probably not forget anytime soon. \nEven so, the team kept its chin up and took a cue from its manager, who stayed classy from beginning to end. \n\"I really couldn't be more proud of a group of guys,\" Gibbons said. \nThe Jays returned to the postseason for the first time in 22 years this season, were one game below .500 at the All-Star break, had two 11-game win streaks during the regular season, and rejuvenated a fanbase for a magical run in the second half ignited by the Trade Deadline acquisitions of Price and Troy Tulowitzki, and the return of Marcus Stroman in September after the Jays starter suffered an ACL tear in spring training. Donaldson, who finished 0-for-5 in Game 6, might win the AL MVP Award. Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion delivered stellar seasons, and the Jays have two promising bullpen pieces in Aaron Sanchez and Roberto Osuna. \nBut the appreciation of a 93-win season will have to come later. In Game 6 of the ALCS, the Jays had a chance to tie or take the lead in the ninth inning, and squandered a chance to extend their postseason run once more. In a year full of memorable offensive moments, they needed one more rally. \nInstead, they're going home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T18:23:27.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
