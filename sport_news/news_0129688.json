(Photo: Joseph Vasquez) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nIf there’s an argument out there that theorizes that the Tulare Union Redskins are not Tulare County’s best team in 2015, it could be silenced by the end of this week. \nIn terms of claiming rights to 2015 Tulare County supremacy, Tulare Union has the opportunity Friday night to seize it from the team who had all legitimate claims to it in 2014 — the Dinuba Emperors. \nThe Redskins (4-0) host Dinuba (3-2) at Bob Mathias Stadium. Game time is 7:30 p.m. \nTulare Union and Dinuba have occupied the top two slots in the Times-Delta/Advance-Register Tulare County Top 5 poll for most of the season; however, the Emperors fell to No. 3 this week following a 28-27 loss to Porterville. \nAside from Tulare County supremacy, Tulare Union is also trying to build its case for one of the top two seeds in the Division II playoff bracket. \nDefending Division II champion Ridgeview (4-0) is the heavy favorite for the No. 1 seed — the Wolf Pack are ranked No. 4 amongst all the state’s Division II teams by CalHiSports — and Tulare Union is the popular choice right now to be the No. 2 seed. \nAnd a win over Dinuba, the 2014 Division II runner-up, should bode well for the Redskins in the playoff seeding meeting. \nBig question about Tulare Union: Will Romello Harris play? \nHarris, who suffered a broken finger early in Tulare Union’s 45-19 win over Kingsburg on Sept. 18, averaged nearly 316 yards rushing per game over the Redskins’ first three games. Harris is ranked as the nation’s No. 42 running back recruit for the Class of 2016 according to the composite rankings of 247sports . \nEven if Harris doesn’t play — and there aren’t many indications that strongly suggest that he will sit out — the Redskins have plenty of firepower waiting in the wings. \nIn Harris’ absence, Tulare Union sophomore Kazmeir Allen had a phenomenal performance versus Kingsburg with 321 yard rushing and four touchdowns. Allen averaged 17.8 yards per carry. \nAside from getting a healthy Harris back, a big key for Tulare Union is establishing its passing attack as a viable threat. \nTulare Union junior quarterback Josh Guerrero has thrown for 515 yards with four touchdowns and four interceptions. \nThe Redskins have two of the area’s better receivers in sophomore Emoryie Edwards (22 catches, 273 yards, three touchdowns) and senior Elijah Dailey (17.6 yards-per-reception average). If Tulare Union can force defenses to respect the pass, it’s going to be nearly impossible for teams to keep Harris under 200 yards. \nThe one Tulare County team that had did the best job of containing Harris last season was Dinuba. Harris rushed for 107 yards on 32 carries (3.3 yards per carry, Harris averaged at least 6.9 yards per carry against every other local team in 2014) and one touchdown in the Emperors’ 26-14 win over the Redskins. \nDinuba is hoping to build its case for receiving the top playoff seed amongst the county’s Division II contingent, and a win over Tulare Union is imperative in that regard — Dinuba is ranked No. 6 in the latest Central Section Division II poll by Calpreps. \nThe Emperors’ top offensive players are senior quarterback Isaac Leppke (60.5 completion rate, 521 yards passing) and senior running back Elijah Benham (521 yards rushing, nine touchdowns). Benham has rushed for 280 yards and five touchdowns over Dinuba’s last two games. \nThis is Tulare Union’s homecoming game. \nHere’s a look at some of the other top story lines in Tulare County high school football this week: \nSid Hosking Trophy Watch: Mt. Whitney gained the early lead for the Sid Hosking Trophy (Visalia city champion amongst the city’s four West Yosemite League schools) with last week’s 22-14 win over El Diamante. But 2014 Sid Hosking champion Golden West (2-2) aims to begin a successful defense by defeating Redwood (0-5, 0-10 Friday night at Giant Chevrolet-Cadillac Mineral King Bowl. Golden West (2-2) has bounced back from two losses to begin the season with back-to-back wins over Reedley (43-34) and Delano (14-0). Gonzalo Rodriguez has been the breakout star this season for the Trailblazers. Golden West is hoping for a similar bump it enjoyed last season when it defeated Redwood in its league opener (20-14). The Trailblazers went on to a third-place finish in the WYL and a semifinal appearance in the Central Section Division IV playoffs. Redwood is looking to avoid its first 0-6 start since 2006. The Rangers will need to win three out of their last five league games to advance to the Division II playoffs. The Calpreps.com computer believes this game should be very competitive, projecting a 24-23 Trailblazer win. Redwood’s offense struggled without star running back Justin Williams (401 yards rushing, 6 total touchdowns) in last week’s 41-6 loss to defending WYL champion Lemoore. \nA WYL surprise? Nothing like throwing a monkey wrench into the WYL title race than an upset of preseason favorite Hanford (5-0, 1-0) this week, right? Well, El Diamante (2-3, 0-1) will have its opportunity Friday night when it hosts the Bullpups at Groppetti Automotive Visalia Community Stadium. Hanford is without receiver/defensive back star Ju’Wuane Hughes (broken arm), but scoring doesn’t appear like it’s going to be a problem. The Bullpups trounced Hanford West 55-27 to open WYL action last week. Hanford accumulated 604 yards of total offense, 490 of those on the ground (Joseph McDaniel rushed for 312 yards and three touchdowns on 25 carries). Hanford is ranked No. 7 amongst the state’s Division III teams by CalHiSports . Miners are still trying to establish an offensive groove (14 points or less in four of their five games). They played without leading rusher Keylan Liles last week against Mt. Whitney, and starting quarterback Joey Vink was injured late in the game against the Pioneers. \nGut-Check Time: CVC’s hopes for a Central Section Division IV title were given a reality check in its last outing, as the Cavaliers fell 27-6 to fellow Division IV school Chowchilla. The Cavaliers (3-1) host Fowler (2-1) in Friday’s homecoming game. Fowler is ranked No. 2 amongst the section’s Division V teams by Calpreps. Although the Cavaliers are considered a favorite over Fowler, it’s difficult to project any highly probable wins for the Cavaliers from here on out. CVC starts Central Sequoia League action next week, and its first two league games are against Dinuba (3-2) and Exeter (4-1). CVC is averaging 219 yard rushing per game. Kolin Stock is among section leaders with 654 yards rushing and seven rushing touchdowns. \nBear Hunt: Tulare Western (2-2) closes out non-league play with a trip to Selma (game time is 7:30 p.m.). Mustangs are looking to shake off last week’s second-half collapse against Madera — a 24-0 Tulare Western halftime lead transformed into a 45-24 Madera win. Tulare Western’s sophomore running back duo of David Alcantar and Mason Bernardo have combined for 477 yards rushing and three rushing touchdowns. Senior linebacker Elijah Alonzo leads the Mustangs with 41 tackles. Selma (4-1) has already matched last year’s win total under first-year head coach Matt Logue. The Bears have done it with offensive firepower. Selma is averaging 45 points per game, and has scored at least 41 points in each of its four wins. Defense isn’t shabby either. Since a season-opening 38-28 loss to Kerman, Selma has allowed just 29 combined points over its last four games. Tulare Western won last year’s meeting, 40-0. \nBarometer Game: Exeter (4-1) gained some local attention with last week’s 41-24 home win over Mission Oak. Monarch freshman quarterback Alec Trujillo had quite a varsity debut with 233 yards passing, and accounting for three touchdowns. Anthony Torres has a team-high 292 yards rushing for the Monarchs. Exeter is on the road Friday to take on Wasco (2-2), one of the better small school programs in the section. Wasco is coming off a 42-14 loss to Bakersfield Christian last week. Exeter won last year’s game, 33-14. \nBye Week: Mission Oak (2-3), Mt. Whitney (3-2), Woodlake (3-2).
