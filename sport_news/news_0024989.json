Had a goal and an assist. \n2. MATT CARKNER, BRIDGEPORT: Veteran defenseman had two assists and was plus-4. \n3. BEN HOLMSTROM, BRIDGEPORT: Captain had two assists in the third period. \nUNSUNG HERO: Defenseman Kevin Czuczman saved a goal with his helmet. \nUP NEXT: Tuesday vs. Springfield, 7 p.m,. \n— MICHAEL FORNABAIO \nThree more goals turned the season's second game into an easy one against an NHL goalie, Dustin Tokarski. \nKearns' first shift back wasn't with his regular linemates. Jared Gomes took the first shift with Beck and Whitney after Kearns got out of the box. Kearns was in Gomes' spot with Ben Holmstrom and Ross Johnston. \n\"Energy,\" Thompson said. \"You get Kearns out there, Gomes, they generate energy. They just work hard. It was just a simple 'go out.'\" \nKearns finished off a third rebound to make it 3-1. After Beck took advantage of a St. John's turnover to score the fourth Bridgeport goal, Gomes got the fifth, reunited with his regular linemates, after Holmstrom won a puck battle. James Wright finished the scoring. \nAttendance was 2,108. \nUntil the outpouring, it seemed the game was might be remembered for a wild few minutes in the second period. Jeremy Gregoire fell over Bridgeport goalie Stephon Williams (33 saves) at 5:49, drawing some attention from the Sound Tigers. \nOff the faceoff to Williams' right, Kearns started throwing punches at opposing centerman Angelo Miceli. \n\"He was hooking me. I actually thought he wanted to fight me,\" Kearns said. \"It ended up, he didn't. I wasn't planning on jumping him.\" \nAll 10 skaters came together. Connor Crisp jumped in to defend Miceli — who later scored his first pro goal — and was ejected as the third man into the altercation. \nOn the power play, Williams aggressively played a chance that kicked to the high slot to Charles Hudon. Hudon's shot hit Bridgeport defenseman Kevin Czuczman's helmet and bounced down to the crease, where Justin Florek covered it (though Bridgeport thought he was pushed onto it). \nGiven a penalty shot, Hudon hit the crossbar. \nMike Halmo deflected home Alan Quine's shot -- Kirill Petrov got the second assist, his first point in North America -- to give Bridgeport a lead in the first period, though the IceCaps had an edge in shots most of the night. \n\"They played well,\" Kearns said. \"They were fast, as scouted. We got physical, which really opened up some room.\" \nSt. John's 0 1 0—1 \nBridgeport 1 0 5—6 \nFirst Period—1, Bridgeport, Halmo 1 (Quine, Petrov), 6:46.
