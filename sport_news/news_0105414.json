Schilling's one-word response, simply \"ISIS\" without any other details or explanation, soon went viral. It has since been retweeted nearly more than 1,700 times and was \"favorited\" more than 2,000 times. ESPN, which suspended Schilling in August after he tweeted a re-post of a meme featuring an image of Adolf Hitler that compared Muslims to Nazis, did not release any comment on the ISIS tweet and Schilling has not followed up with any additional comments on the issue since Tuesday's debate. \nAlthough he did take exception to a tweet later Tuesday night accusing him of \"rooting\" for ISIS, responding \"how is that even remotely what you got from that?\" He followed that up with another tweet early Wednesday morning after another Twitter user asked for clarification on whether he supports ISIS or not, responding with \"thats not a serious question right?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:25:26.910+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
