Meridian got after us pretty good. We asked the kids at halftime, can we play 24 minutes of our football?” \nThe Mountaineers came out the second half and were much more physical, amd eventually rewarded by two 10-yard TD passes from Mason Bass – the first to T.J. Bass with 4:46 left in the game and then to Thomas Barbo to make it 21-19 at the start of the fourth quarter. \nThe senior quarterback made the big play on defense too, intercepting a Meridian pass with eight minutes left, leading to the go-ahead score – a two-yard punch-in from Mason Bass. He converted the two-point try to make it 27-21. \nBut Meridian wasn’t rolling over. \nThe Trojans took the next drive 72 yards, capped by Nikolas Dritsas’ 10-yard TD catch off a deflected pass from Simon Burkett to give Meridian the lead back at 28-27 with 2:04 remaining. \nDuring the drive, however, a mystery minute was suddenly added to the clock, which ended up favoring the Mountaineers because on the Mounties’ next possession, they took the ball 87 yards to score the game-winning touchdown – a 16-yard pass play from Mason Bass to T.J. Bass with 51 seconds left on the clock. \n“I knew the whole time we were going to win,” Barbo said. “We are a really good second-half team. We never give up.” \nWhen coach Ron Lepper was asked about the clock error after the game, he just grinned. \nHe’d much rather have his quarterback’s four touchdowns – three in air and one on ground – Carson Engholm’s 120 rushing yards and Barbo’s seven catches for 184 yards be the story of the game. \n“It was a lot of fun,” Barbo said. “Mason threw some great balls to me, the offensive line did a great job blocking for him.” \nThe Trojans made a good effort at a last-minute game-winning drive but a Burkett pass in the red zone was overthrown with no time left on the clock. \nBurkett finished 15 for 31 with 166 yards and two passing touchdowns – Alan Eyoub caught his first TD pass to put the Trojans up 7-0 in the first quarter – while running for 63 yards on six carries and a 39-yard rumbling score in the first half. \nMount Baker faces Lynden Christian next Friday while Meridian will play Nooksack Valley. \nMount Baker", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:47:58.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
