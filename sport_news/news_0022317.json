Staten Island has always been home to some of the toughest players in the city, so it’s no wonder that one of the borough’s teams made it all the way to Yankee Stadium for the PSAL Championship Division title game.\n Just because Tottenville lost there, take nothing away from the Pirates, who have become one of the most steady teams in the city under the guidance of longtime coach Jim Munson. Despite a storm of controversy surrounding his squad, Munson kept the Pirates on the path to the title game. And we’ve got to hand it to Curtis star Kevin Austin, who’s 20 TDs helped the Warriors reach the PSAL Championship Division semifinals. Player of the Year: RB Kevin Austin, Curtis, Sr.: There might not have been a more electric playmaker in the city than Austin. He was a legitimate home-run threat for the Warriors, possessing the ability to rip off a 70-yard-plus touchdown at any moment, which he did several times. No running back in the PSAL had more rushing yards or touchdowns than Austin, who after the playoffs finished with exactly 1,500 yards on the ground and 20 touchdowns. He stepped up his game in the playoffs, helping Curtis to a semifinal appearance in the Championship Division with 551 yards and five touchdowns in three playoff games.

RB Mario Villafane , Port Richmond, Sr. OL/DL Foster Yates , Curtis, Sr. Coach of the Year Jim Munson, Tottenville: Munson has made Tottenville one of the elite programs in the city, consistently in the mix for a PSAL Championship Division crown. He led the Pirates to their second title game appearance in four years after being bounced from the last two postseasons in the semifinals. They fell just a point short to Erasmus Hall at Yankee Stadium. The Pirates (10-1) boasted the city’s best defense, surrendering a minuscule 7.8 points a game and notching four shutouts, plus a dynamic offense led by senior signal-caller Brandon Barnes and senior running back Augustus Edwards.
