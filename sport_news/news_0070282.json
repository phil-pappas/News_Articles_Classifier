(Photo: Geoff Burke/USA TODAY Sports) \nPHILADELPHIA It’s not that Zach Ertz was taking a shot at Jimmy Graham last year when he responded “probably not” when asked if Graham would get a lot of playing time in the Eagles’ offense. \nAt the time, the comment seemed ridiculous, and Ertz was criticized for it because Graham is considered one of the best receiving tight ends in the NFL. But Ertz’s point was that the Eagles’ system requires tight ends to block, something Graham rarely had to do for the New Orleans Saints the previous five seasons. \nGraham, in fact, always saw himself more as a wide receiver. He even tried to be classified as one when New Orleans put the franchise tag on him. Graham lost the appeal -- and a few million dollars in salary -- based on the pay scale for a tight end compared to a receiver. \n“It was probably something I shouldn’t have said at the time,” Ertz said Thursday about Graham. “He’s a heck of a player.” \nBut Ertz’s words have proven to be prophetic after Graham was traded to Seattle last March. Graham is struggling this season because the Seahawks are asking him to stay in and block more, and his receiving numbers are down. \nErtz’s receiving numbers are down, too, compared to this point last season. But as the Eagles prepare for their game Sunday against Graham’s former team, the Saints, Ertz is playing more because he has worked diligently to make himself a better blocker. \n“We want to establish the run game,” Ertz said. “It helps when you have a very good run-blocking tight end. I want to be a dominant tight end in this league. If I want to be dominant, I have to be on the field more, and run blocking here is the No. 1 priority as a tight end.” \nErtz has played 63 percent of the snaps this season, a good deal more than Brent Celek, who’s at 46 percent. That’s a switch from Ertz’s previous two seasons in the NFL when Celek, considered an elite blocker, played much more than Ertz. \nDespite the additional playing time, Ertz has 10 receptions for 104 yards and no touchdowns this season. He had 13 catches for 220 yards and 1 TD through four games last season. \nEagles coach Chip Kelly said the production dip is misleading. For one, Ertz had hernia surgery on Aug. 13 and missed all four preseason games, returning just in time for the season-opener against Atlanta. \nThe other reason is a product of the Eagles’ struggling offense overall. \n“I think he started slow coming off the injury,” Kelly said. “He didn’t have preseason camp … I think he’s progressed nicely. We were happy that we got him back. He’s obviously a weapon for us. He is doing a better job blocking. I think that’s part of what he has really wanted to improve on so he can be on the field more, and he has been on the field more. \n“But I think the numbers for everybody on offense are down just because we haven’t been successful.” \nThat was evident last Sunday against Washington. The Eagles had a first down at the Washington 11 in the second quarter when quarterback Sam Bradford found Ertz in the corner of the end zone. The play was called back because of an illegal formation penalty on Nelson Agholor. \n“That’s when you kind of feel sick to your stomach a little bit,” Ertz said. “But you have to pick yourself up and move on.” \nAnd Ertz has moved on. He was like Graham coming up through high school and college, mostly a receiving tight end who rarely worried about blocking. Now, he’s on the verge of becoming a strong pass-catching tight end and a good blocker. \n“I was a high school receiver slash a little bit of tight end and a basketball player,” he said. “Then I go to Stanford and we have three tight ends, and one of them was a really good blocker. They kind of used him for in-line stuff and they used me in the slot. It’s kind of been a learn-on-the-job-type thing and I’ve learned a lot over the past couple years.” \nAnd that’s why he’s playing more. \nWing tips \n>> It looks like the Eagles won’t have to shuffle their offensive line for the game as left tackle Jason Peters was listed as questionable with a quadriceps injury, but expects to play after going through practice Thursday and Friday. Right tackle Lane Johnson, dealing with a knee injury, is listed as probable. Johnson was expected to take some practice reps at left tackle just in case Peters can’t go. \n>> The Eagles listed inside linebackers Kiko Alonso (knee) and Mychal Kendricks (hamstring ) as out, meaning that DeMeco Ryans and Jordan Hicks will play practically the entire game. Defensive end Brandon Bair is out with a groin injury just as fellow defensive ends Cedric Thornton (hand) and Taylor Hart (shoulder) are returning. \nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com .
