They learned that a juvenile female had invited an 18-year-old male into her home without her parents’ knowledge. When her father discovered the male, he called police and told them he would hold him until they arrived. The teen was allowed to call his parents.\n Instead, deputies learned that he called Harris, who forced his way into the home, hitting the girl’s parents with the door in the process. Harris then retrieved the 18-year-old and fled the scene.\nWhen deputies found Harris, he claimed he had nothing to do with the incident and began walking away. As deputies tried to stop him, he resisted and tried to strike deputies in the face. Deputies said Harris continued to violently resist, but they were eventually able to place him under arrest.\nHarris was booked into the Lafourche Parish Detention Center. He was released Sunday night after posting $10,300 bond.\nThere was no evidence that the 18-year-old committed a crime, and he was not arrested in the incident.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
