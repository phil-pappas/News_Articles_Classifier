Through his first two NFL games, the second-round draft pick from Ohio State has only five receptions for 53 yards despite being targeted 15 times. \nSmith sat out the first two games while still recovering from fractured ribs suffered during the team’s second training-camp practice in late July. But he and the Jets believe he’s ready for a breakout performance, perhaps Sunday against visiting Washington. \n\"It’s hard to tell; you never know,\" Smith said Wednesday when asked if he thinks he’s getting close to having a big game. \"I feel like I’m practicing very well each and every week. … My time’s going to come, so I’m just going to stay patient and leave everything up to God.\" \nQuarterbacks coach Kevin Patullo acknowledged the chemistry between Smith and veteran quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick is a work in progress. \n\"Getting used to [Smith’s] play speed and style is a little different\" for a quarterback, Patullo said. \"He’s one of those guys that kind of just glides and you don’t realize how fast he is. So for a quarterback, that’s difficult to judge. … So it does take time and it’s getting better. It’s definitely improving.\" \nInterestingly, Fitzpatrick and Smith gave similar answers when asked about their chemistry, each referencing other wide receivers on the team. \n\"We just have to keep working on it,\" Fitzpatrick said Wednesday. \"That’s with everybody, from Brandon [Marshall] and down the line. Everybody has to come to practice every day to work and continue to get better. I think if we continue to get better, then that’s all you can ask for.\" \nSmith said Fitzpatrick must have a rapport \"not just with myself, but with all the guys — Eric Decker, Brandon Marshall, and all those guys. It’s all about us getting in a rhythm, us getting better, and us making it easy on the quarterback.\" \nThey were all on the same page Wednesday. Now they must get there on game day. \nSmith was put at a disadvantage when he suffered the rib injury while making a catch July 31. He missed all of the preseason games while rehabbing, thus being deprived of valuable time with Fitzpatrick. The Jets didn’t want to rush him back, so he also sat out the first two games even after returning to practice. \nHe finally made his pro debut in a loss to Philadelphia on Sept. 27, and had three catches for 39 yards. He had only two receptions for 14 yards against the Dolphins, and was victimized by eight-year veteran Bowman’s professional shove against him while they jockeyed for position on an underthrown pass. \n\"I had a step on him,\" Smith said. \"I started to come back to the ball and the guy ran into me and I fell down. I felt there was supposed to be a flag, but this is the NFL and you never know what’s going to happen. That was just one of those plays where they didn’t call [a penalty]. … That was just one of those things. You learn from it and keep moving forward.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:50:33.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
