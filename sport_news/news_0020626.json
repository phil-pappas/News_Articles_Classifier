Offensive coordinator Clay Helton was appointed interim coach Sunday. \nUSC hasn’t elaborated on Sarkisian’s problems, but the second-year coach had an embarrassing public display in August at a pep rally where he appeared to be intoxicated while giving a speech. Sarkisian later apologized and said he had combined alcohol and medication, but promised not to drink again during the season. \nSarkisian’s unsteady appearance Sunday prompted Haden to make the program’s fourth coaching change in just over two years. \n“After careful consideration of what is in the best interest of the university and our student-athletes, I have made the decision to terminate Steve Sarkisian, effective immediately,” Haden said in a statement. \n“I want to add how proud I am of our coaching staff and players and the way they are responding to this difficult situation. Through all of this we remain concerned for Steve and hope that it will give him the opportunity to focus on his personal well-being.” \nHelton, Sarkisian’s offensive coordinator, will officially lead his first practice Tuesday as the Trojans (3-2, 1-2 Pac-12) prepare for their annual rivalry game at No. 14 Notre Dame. \nSarkisian went 12-6 at USC, where he started as an assistant coach under Pete Carroll with the program’s dominant teams of the past decade. \n“This is an opportunity for Sark to get right and to get well,” Carroll said Monday. “We’re pulling for him. He’s up against some big challenges and he’s got to go ahead and take care of it. It’s not about coaching now. It’s about his personal life and getting things in order. I know he’s committed to taking the right steps to do that, and it’s hugely important for him.” \nCarroll said he had communicated with Sarkisian recently. \n“I’ll be there to support him,” Carroll said. “I knew him before, and (he has) a lot to offer the world. It’s been hard on him, and he’s made it hard on people around him, too. He knows that. He’s got to take the steps to take care of business now.” \nSarkisian spent five years as Washington’s head coach until 2013, when he left the Huskies for a reported five-year contract to return to his native Southern California, describing it as “a dream come true to be back in the Trojan family.” \nSarkisian never faced significant public scrutiny for alcohol use in Seattle, although his enthusiasm for nights out became part of his identity among fans and boosters. An AP review of Sarkisian’s expense reports from his years at Washington showed a steady acquisition of alcohol on his trips, ranging from mild indulgences to lavish liquor purchases, sometimes before lunch.
