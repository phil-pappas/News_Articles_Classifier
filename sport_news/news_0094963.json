Yankees need to look for new right-handed middle relievers.\nCarlos Beltran, RF/DH, $15 million \nTurns 39 in April and in final season of three-year, $45 million deal. Productive at the plate but exposed in outfield.\nDellin Betances, RHP, Pre-arbitration \nWill continue to provide great value at the back of the bullpen.\nGreg Bird could open 2016 in Triple-A. Photo: Charles Wenzelberg Greg Bird, 1B, Pre-arbitration \nFilled in admirably at first base, but nowhere to play if Mark Teixeira and Alex Rodriguez return, which could leave him back in minors.\nChris Capuano, LHP, Free agent \nDesignated for assignment four times, but used in important spots down the stretch. Change of scenery may be in order.\nStephen Drew, 2B/SS, Free agent \nFuture is up in the air after second concussion in two years ended season.\nJacoby Ellsbury, CF, $21.1 million \nBrutal second half after returning from a right knee sprain. Entering third year of seven-year, $153 million deal.\nNathan Eovaldi, RHP, Arbitration \nFine season until derailed by elbow inflammation. Under team control until 2017 and due for a raise from $3.3 million salary.\nBrett Gardner, LF, $13 million \nIf Yankees make major addition, Gardner more moveable than expensive counterpart Ellsbury.\nDidi Gregorius, SS, Arbitration \nShook off a shaky start and performed well in Derek Jeter’s old job.\nChase Headley had a down year at the plate and in the field. Photo: Anthony J. Causi Chase Headley, 3B, $13 million \nHopes to rebound from worst year defensively, as well as a dreadful final month at the plate.\nSlade Heathcott, OF, Pre-arbitration \nOft-injured rookie showed flashes, but hasn’t proven he can stay healthy enough to be fourth outfielder.\nJacob Lindgren, LHP, Pre-arbitration \nRookie underwent elbow surgery in June, but could be back next season.\nBrian McCann, C, $17 million \nSet a career high in homers, but faded after terrific first half. Yankees will look to rest him more in future seasons.\nBryan Mitchell, RHP, Pre-arbitration \nAnother young righty who is thought of highly. Is this the offseason he is traded?\nJohn Ryan Murphy, C, Pre-arbitration \nEmerged as capable backup and solid right-handed bat and could fill the same role next year.\nAndrew Miller, LHP, $9 million \nNasty slider made him effective in the closer’s role after signing a four-year, $36 million contract.\nIvan Nova, RHP, Arbitration \nMade $3.3 million in a tumultuous season coming back from Tommy John surgery. Yankees expected to bring him back.\nJames Pazos, LHP, Pre-arbitration \nWent from unknown to wild-card roster.\nCC Sabathia is owed $25 million for 2016, if he continues playing following a stint in alcohol rehab. Photo: Getty Images Michael Pineda, RHP, Arbitration \nInconsistent right-hander will look to finally become a dependable starter. Made $2.1 million in 2015.\nRob Refsnyder, 2B, Pre-arbitration \nIf Yankees acquire a veteran second baseman, he could be sent down for more seasoning.\nAlex Rodriguez, DH, $20 million \nDespite second-half swoon, was most dangerous hitter in lineup at times. Two years, $40 million left on contract.\nBrendan Ryan, IF, $2M club option/$1M player option \nYankees will look to upgrade infield depth this offseason.\nCC Sabathia, LHP, $25 million \nSeason ended in stunning fashion when he checked himself into alcohol rehab facility. Expected back for 2016 with $25 million vesting option set to kick in for 2017, barring shoulder injury.\nLuis Severino, RHP, Pre-arbitration \nAfter flying through minors, Severino could be a vital member of the rotation. Yankees refused to move him at trade deadline, but things could change in offseason.\nChasen Shreve, LHP, Pre-arbitration \nHave to determine whether his horrific end to the season was aberration or sign hitters figured him out.\nAdam Warren: rotation anchor or trade bait? Photo: Paul J. Bereswill Masahiro Tanaka, RHP, $22 million \nEffective despite pitching with a partially torn elbow ligament. Can opt out after 2017 season, but is key member of next year’s rotation.\nMark Teixeira, 1B/DH, $22.5 million: \nResurgent season came to end after fracturing leg in August. His bat — and glove — were sorely missed. Has full no-trade clause.\nAdam Warren, RHP, Arbitration \nFrequently has come up in trade talks, but Yankees are reluctant to move him. Figures to be key piece to 2016 staff but is valuable trade piece.\nJustin Wilson, LHP, Arbitration \nHard to imagine best addition to bullpen last offseason — besides Miller — does not return.\nChris Young, OF, Free agent \nHad .972 OPS versus lefties, which could earn more than $2.5 million Yankees gave him last offseason.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under adam warren ,  alex rodriguez ,  andrew bailey ,  andrew miller ,  brendan ryan ,  brett gardner ,  bryan mitchell ,  carlos beltran ,  cc sabathia ,  chase headley ,  chasen shreve ,  chris capuano ,  chris young ,  dellin betances ,  didi gregorius ,  dustin ackley ,  greg bird ,  ivan nova ,  jacob lindgren ,  jacoby ellsbury ,  james pazos ,  john ryan murphy ,  justin wilson ,  luis severino ,  mark teixeira ,  masahiro tanaka ,  michael pineda ,  nathan eovaldi ,  new york yankees ,  rob refsnyder ,  slade heathcott ,  stephen drew", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T13:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:29:54.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
