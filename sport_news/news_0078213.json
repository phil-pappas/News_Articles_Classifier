We put a horse out there in front of him ... Madam Aamoura ... he needed a target.\"\nWith Martin Garcia in the saddle, American Pharoah galloped straight off from the quarter mile chute and was set down approaching the five-furlong pole, well behind stablemate Madam Aamoura, a 3-year-old filly.\nAmerican Pharoah then zipped through splits of 12.20, 24.00, 35.00, 47.00, 59.80 and 1:11.40.\n\"This is the first time since the Aug. 29 Travers that he's let this horse roll,\" said highly respected private clocker Gary Young. \"The previous works here were maintenance works.\n\"This was serious. He started out about seven lengths behind the target and he went by the target like a freight train by a hobo at the three sixteenths. He looked good throughout.\"\nBaffert had initially planned to ship American Pharoah to Kentucky well ahead of the Oct. 31 Breeders' Cup Classic, which will be run at Keeneland in Lexington.\nHowever, uncertain weather in the Bluegrass State caused Baffert to keep his prized colt in Arcadia \"until the 25th or 27th (of October),\" the trainer said.\nAmerican Pharoah entered the pantheon of U.S. thoroughbred racing's all-time greats by winning the Belmont Stakes wire-to-wire in June to become the first horse to capture the coveted 'Triple Crown' in nearly four decades.\nIn winning a seventh straight race, American Pharoah became the 12th horse and first since Affirmed in 1978 to sweep the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes.\nAfter making his farewell racing performance in the Breeders' Cup Classic, the muscular son of 2009 Kentucky Derby runner-up Pioneerof the Nile will then retire to stud.
