In luge, she's an elite athlete. In taekwondo, she's a rookie. \n\"When she came to class, in the beginning, we didn't know she was an Olympic athlete,\" said Master Seoung Min Rim. \nThat changed quickly when Rim witnessed McRae's strength and power on the mat. \n\"Taekwondo is really good for hand-eye coordination,\" he said. \n\"It helps you control your mind better and breathe better. And because she travels a lot as an Olympic athlete, learning how to defend herself is a bonus.\" \nMcRae, a 23-year-old from Victoria and a graduate of Calgary's National Sports School, decided to try taekwondo in March. \nShe had battled depression after the Sochi Olympics as she dealt with some family issues, and her emotional struggles manifested in her results with a lone sixth-place finish her best performance of the 2014-15 season. \nAccording to McRae, the physical benefits of taekwondo are already showing in the gym, but the mental aspect is perhaps even more important. \n\"It helps a lot,\" she said. \n\"In here, you have to be focused 100 per cent of the time to be able to get the kicks and the punches and everything correct. I still struggle with memory and memorizing things, but I know that it's slowly getting better and better as we go along here.\" \nCanada's luge athletes left the Sochi Olympics a dejected bunch. Trailblazer Alex Gough finished an agonizing fourth in the women's event, just head of McRae. \nTristan Walker and Justin Snith slid into fourth place in the men's doubles. And in what was considered Canada's best bet for a medal, Sam Edney, Gough, Walker and Smith finished one-10th of a second out of third place in the team relay. \nOnly 22 at the time, McRae was seen as a reason to be optimistic about Canada's chances on the luge track in Pyeongchang. \n\"Kim is one of the most driven athletes I've met in a long time,\" said Edney, the elder statesman of the team at 31. \"She's just a workhorse when it comes down to it. \n\"She's quite a shy individual until she gets to know the people around her. I think that's something that's coming out of this new lesson in life for her, this taekwondo. The personal strength and personal confidence, I think she'll apply both to her life and sport.\" \nOnly seven months into her martial- arts journey, McRae has traded her white belt for yellow and then, just last week, upgraded again. \nAnd while an Olympic medal, preferably gold, ranks as her top priority, she is also shooting for another goal in time for the Pyeongchang Games. \n\"Master Rim would like to see me in a black belt by 2018,\" she said. \"But we'll just slowly progress as we go along.\" \nOn the ice, McRae clearly benefits from training with Gough, the first Canadian to win gold in a luge World Cup race and the first Canadian woman to win a medal at the luge world championships. \nShe hopes the lessons learned in martial arts will help her move into Gough's league, a legitimate medal contender in every race she enters. \n\"Following in her footsteps is hard at times, just because she is that much better,\" said McRae, who has one World Cup medal, a bronze, on her resume. \"I feel like I'm always playing catch-up. It pushes me in the gym every day, trying to compete with her and be with her on the world stage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:43:56.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
