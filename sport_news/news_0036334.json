First, her last words were to forgive her attacker, which caused him to convert to Catholicism and later become a Franciscan lay brother, according to a website on the U.S. pilgrimage.\n\"She is known for forgiving even in the midst of her physical suffering,\" Edward Flavin, director of communication for the Joliet Diocese, said.\nSecond, Goretti is attributed with having performed the most miracles, the brochure says.\n\"As for how miracles are attributed to St. Maria Goretti or any saint, a person was sick, a cure was out of the question, prayers were directed to a particular person (not necessarily yet a saint or even beatified), the sick person is cured and doctors have no natural explanation for it,\" Flavin wrote in an email.\nRemains of St. Maria Goretti, the youngest Catholic saint, arrive in Chicago Remains of St. Maria Goretti, the youngest Catholic saint, arrive in Chicago.

At St. Francis of Assisi, the veneration is from 9 a.m. to midnight, Wednesday with a Mass at 7 p.m. In Plainfield Thursday, veneration is from 10 a.m. to the 11 p.m. night prayer. There will be a rosary at noon and 9 p.m., a Divine Mercy Chaplet at 3 p.m., and a Mass at 7 p.m.\nFor more information about Saint Maria Goretti and the U.S. tour, visit www.mariagoretti.com .\nErin Gallagher is a freelance reporter.\nCopyright Â© 2015, Daily Southtown Pope Francis", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561c57d3/turbine/ct-st-maria-goretti-catholic-saint-chicago-video-20151012", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561c5378/turbine/ct-sta-youngest-saint-st-1013-20151012"], "published": "2015-10-13T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:26:11.945+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
