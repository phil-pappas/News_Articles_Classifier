John Collins / Baker City Herald Kayla Bolen welcomes her daughter, Presley Diana Rose Bolen, who was born on Oct. 17 at St. Alphonsus Medical Center-Baker City. Local Officials Seek To Prevent Babies From Dying From Co-Sleeping By Chris Collins This e-mail address is being protected from spam bots, you need JavaScript enabled to view it Kayla Bolen left St. Alphonsus Medical Center Tuesday with a plan aimed at ensuring the safety of her newborn baby girl as she sleeps. Presley Diana Rose Bolen was delivered by cesarean section at 8:53 a.m. on Oct. 17, 2015, just two days after her mother’s 28th birthday on Oct. 15. Rick Torres is the baby’s father. Presley is Kayla’s first child, so she’s been studying proper parenting techniques while awaiting Presley’s arrival and in anticipation of taking her home. “I’m just excited for us to have a new life together,” Kayla said. While at the St. Alphonsus Birth Center, nurses explained, as they do for each new mother, the details of safe sleeping. The information is based on guidelines from the National Institute of Health and Human Development Safe to Sleep (formerly Back to Sleep) program and the American Academy of Pediatrics, said Sommer Sargent, obstetrics supervisor at the Birth Center. Kayla said she has a bassinet for her baby to sleep in at home. She said she wasn’t aware of the recommendation to keep blankets and toys out of her baby’s bed, but on thinking about it, she agreed that it makes sense. Sargent came to the Baker hospital in 2008, the same year a Baker County baby died of Shaken Baby Syndrome. A short time later, the hospital implemented the “Period of Purple Crying” program to help parents better understand their baby’s prolonged bouts of crying. In 2009, three babies died of positional asphyxiation linked to co-sleeping with their parents. Soon the hospital stepped up its program to educate parents about safe sleeping. Again this year, two babies have died in cases linked to co-sleeping. Those deaths have spurred District Attorney Matt Shirtcliff to roll up his slee ves to try to do more to keep babies safe. “It’s not an accident when it’s avoidable,” he said of co-sleeping. “If any baby can die from this we’ve got to preach ‘don’t do it, don’t do it, don’t do it.’” Shirtcliff said he wants parents to realize that when they leave the hospital, they should be just as concerned about having a crib for their baby to sleep in as they are about having a car seat ready to take them home in. “If they don’t have a crib, we’re gonna get them one,” he said. In a search for ways to do that, Wade Swiger, an investigator who works in Shirtcliff’s office, happened to place a call to Judith Bannon of Pittsburgh, executive director and founder of Cribs for Kids. It just so happened that Bannon and her associate Judy Rainey, were planning a trip out West and agreed to add Baker City to their travel plans. Cribs for Kids, which started as a nonprofit, has been transformed into a business that works with 600 partners nationwide to provide cribs for parents who need help providing their babies with a safe place to sleep, Bannon said in a telephone interview from Pittsburgh Wednesday. Bannon says she believes, as has happened many times in her experience with Cribs for Kids, it was “the hand of God” that led Swiger to call her that day. “What a wonderful group of people,” she said, about meeting members of the Baker County multidisciplinary team, which includes representatives from law enforcement, the medical community, schools and social services agencies, “I was so impressed with the hospital, the police department, the home visiting programs and Matt and Wade,” Bannon said. As a result of the Oct. 13 meeting with Bannon and Rainey, community partners have agreed to form a Cribs for Kids program in Baker County. The program provides Pack ’n Play systems that provide a safe sleeping environment at a reduced cost of $49.99 purchased wholesale through Graco Co., a Pennsylvania firm. Each Pack ’n Play will come with a crib sheet, a sleep sack, a pacifier and safe sleep information, Bannon said. The items will most likely ship from a distribution center in Hesperia, California, to save on costs, she added. Bannon, 70, was working for the nonprofit organization SIDS of Pennsylvania when the Back to Sleep program was initiated and the number of baby deaths declined by 50 percent. Still, a review of child deaths in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, showed that 90 percent of babies who died of SIDS or accidental suffocation were not found sleeping in their own beds. Many of the families who had lost their babies were low-income and could not afford the expense, Bannon said. Through her association with her own district attorney, Bannon went to work to secure cribs and eventually partnered with Graco and others to establish Cribs for Kids. She and her daughter, Jennifer, have collaborated to produce a book titled “Five Ladies and a Forklift” detailing how it all came about. The book, which leads others through her business model, will be released in December through Amazon, she said. In the early days, Bannon said she and her associates “were spending every cent we made on cribs.” Through their partnership with Graco the company has grown and “for under $50 you can save a baby’s life.” During the Baker City meeting, Bannon said she learned that St. Alphonsus Medical Center already is doing many of the things recommended by Cribs for Kids to ensure that parents understand how to keep their babies safe. Shirtcliff said soon a community-wide effort supported by doctors at Eastern Oregon Medical Associates, the hospital and social services agencies will work toward establishing the model that no baby leaves the hospital without a safe place to sleep. The Bith Center already sends a free Halo SleepSack Swaddle home with each family. And the proper procedure for safe sleep is modeled for parents in the hospital where sleep sacks are used and the babies are placed on their backs in bassinets next to the mother when they are sleeping — never in bed with their mother. “The recommendation is you don’t bed share, but you room share,” Sargent said, in explaining the Safe to Sleep standards. Babies should only be placed on a firm mattress in a safety approved crib covered with a fitted sheet. And, no matter how many afghans are knitted or special quilts created by grandmas, aunts and friends they should not be placed in the bed with babies. Nor should stuffed animals or pets. “Blankets handmade by a relative or dear friend are very important,” Sargent said, but they should not be used in the baby’s bed. The Northeast Oregon Compassion Center at the Nazarene Church at 1250 Hughes Lane will distribute the Play ’n Packs to families who need a safe crib for their babies, Shirtcliff said. Fundraising efforts will help pay for the cost of the Play ’n Pack beds. The educational campaign also will extend to information displayed on a billboard on 10th Street warning against co-sleeping, posters and informational fliers distributed throughout the community, and lessons taught during health classes at the high school. “We hope to get the message out that co-sleeping is lethal,” Shirtcliff said. “I’m responsible for reviewing child deaths and I want to stop them.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T12:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:10:56.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
