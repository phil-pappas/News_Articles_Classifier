In college football, Oregon and Alabama are out of the Top 5 (the former out of the Top 25 entirely). In the NFL, the New England Patriots are defending champions and looking poised for a repeat. And in baseball, the New York Mets, Chicago Cubs and Houston Astros are in the playoffs. (Even the Ridgecrest sports world had a throwback, as yesterday’s Homecoming game remembered the 2005 CIF Championship-winning squad.) But those moments all define the nature of sports to go full circle. A lot of people lost a ton of money playing favorites in MLB (so discrepant was the Washington Nationals’ finish that it cost their manager, Matt Williams, his job). And now that the NFLis one-fourth of the way in, the question is what is going to take place in the league that will bring back memories of a few years ago. Here are some things to watch out for: • The Carolina Panthers are undefeated and, for now, have no signs of slowing down. They have won their games by an average of nine points. Two Panthers are on the NFLleaderboard in interceptions (Josh Norman with four and Thomas Davis with two). One of the last times that the Panthers were mentioned in such a positive light was when they faced the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXVIII - that was after the 2003 season. • The San Francisco 49ers, after enjoying some time at the top of the NFCWest, returned to their pre-Jim Harbaugh ways. Before the current-Michigan coach took over the program, the team had lost five consecutive games to start the season. Currently, the 49ers are 1-3 to start the 2015 season. It’s probably not something that surprises many people. With the 49ers suffering the worst offseason of any team in recent memory, their preseason 100-1 odds to win the Super Bowl spelled out the pessimism of many. •The Detroit Lions are 0-4. The last time they started the season as such, the won their next game. That’s good news. The bad news is that the last time they started 0-5, they didn’t taste victory all season. That was 2008. At least Lions coach Jim Caldwell has never ended the season like that. Maybe 2-14, but that’s no 0-16.
