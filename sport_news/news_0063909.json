The Panthers scored in every quarter to defeat Waitsburg, 42-14. “Asotin is one heck of a good team,” Cardinals coach Troy Larsen said. “They are a smaller, athletic group that just flew by us. We’ve got to get that fixed.” The Panthers returned the opening kickoff to their own 40. Eleven plays and four-and-a-half minutes later, Panthers quarterback Blake Magnuson went in from the 3 for his first of three rushing touchdowns, and the Panthers took the lead for good at 7-0 with 7:30 left in the first period. The Cardinal offense went three-and-out on both of its first-quarter possessions. “We had a pretty good week of practice, but we came out flat,” Larsen said. “Our line struggled with their athleticism and quickness.” Magnuson went in from the 2 to cap a 49-yard march and give the Panthers a 14-0 lead with 8:35 left in the second quarter. Waitsburg got it going on its ensuing drive. Quarterback Jacob Dunn hit a short three-yard pass to Jordan Garrity, followed that up with a 24-yard completion to Nickolas Kitselman, and then hit Brandon Penner down the near sideline for 39 yards to the Panther 17. Waitsburg lost a yard, but on the next snap, Dunn rolled right and fired to Penner, who made a hands catch to narrow the Asotin lead to 14-6 with 5:20 left in the half. “When Jacob had time, we could pass on these guys,” Larsen added. “Then, they put seven guys back there. We have to maintain our focus and intensity.” Asotin answered as Josh Storey took the ensuing kickoff 82 yards to the house. The Panthers ran it in for the 2-point conversion and took a 22-6 lead to intermission. Although Travis Crockett got off a 10-yard scamper and went 38 on a draw play, the Cardinals came up empty to open the second half. The Panthers, after a Penner punt pinned them at their own 14, put together an 86-yard march with 6-foot-3, 215-pound Colton Ball, who led the Panthers with 81 rushing yards, going the last 3 yards for a Panther 28-6 lead after three. To open the fourth, two Panther pass interference penalties, and a Dunn-to-Crockett swing pass for 17 yards helped move Waitsburg to a fourth-and-3 at the Panther 13. Dunn connected with Russel Jarvis for 12 yards and a first down at the Asotin 1, Dunn took it in and the Cardinals were down two scores, trailing 28-14 with 9:32 left. Asotin did it again on the ensuing kickoff, as Magnuson broke it for 65 yards before stepping out of bounds on the Cardinal 17. Four plays later, Magnuson went in from the 4 and the Cardinals were down 35-14 with only eight minutes left. “That quarterback (Magnuson) was a pretty shifty quarterback that controlled the game,” Larsen said. “Whenever I thought we were getting back into it, he would pull something off and dart up the field again.” The Panthers added a late score to run the final to 42-14. “You give them (Asotin) a lot of credit,” Larsen said. “(However), we are a new group of kids that have never been in this situation. We are having a hard time bringing it every time. We are battling ourselves a little right now. We’ve got to be smarter football players and we’re getting there. We just don’t have the experience yet.” Penner punted six times for the Cardinals and averaged 37.5 yards per kick, and Crockett ran 17 times for 118 yards to pace the Cardinal effort. Waitsburg (4-3, 1-1 league) travels to Pasco and Edgar Brown Stadium Thursday to close out the regular SE2B season against Tri-Cities Prep. “They take our league’s first and second (for the crossover with District 9 to determine state berths),” Larsen added. “We have to beat Tri-Cities Prep. Everything we want is still out there in front of us. It’s up to us to go get it.” Asotin 42, Waitsburg 14 Asotin 7 15 6 14 — 42 Waitsburg 0 6 0 8 — 14 Aso — Magnuson 4 run (Storey kick).
