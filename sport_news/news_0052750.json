(Don Markus) \nBetween Jones, Barrett, Elliott, Bosa, Lee and the like, Ohio State has plenty of big names on both sides of the ball. Is there anyone that flies a little under the radar that could have a big game for Ohio State? Who else should Maryland fans familiarize themselves with? \nCurtis Samuel gets overlooked, but the hybrid back is quite dangerous. Fellow hybrid Dontre Wilson has played better lately after being a disappointment his first two seasons. On defense, defensive end Tyquan Lewis is an emerging star and has benefited from the extra attention offenses must pay to Joey Bosa. Backup defensive end Sam Hubbard is another guy who's made an impact. He's a former lacrosse player. \nIs there anything to Urban Meyer not mentioning Maryland in his Monday press conference? \nNot really. I don't think it was a deliberate slight. It might have a case of \"if you can't say anything nice...,\" but there was enough that needed to be addressed following the Indiana game that it's more about the Buckeyes for Ohio State than any opponent. And you can blame us in the media as well. Nobody asked him about Maryland. I know that he does have respect for Randy Edsall, the pride of Glen Rock, Pa. (I proudly worked for 10 years at the York Daily Record.) \nBONUS QUESTION: This is Maryland's first trip to Columbus. What should Terps fans making the trip do or see during their weekend in Columbus? \nOhio Stadium, dubbed the Horseshoe because that was the original shape of the stadium before the south stands were filled in, is one of the iconic football stadiums in the country. Walk around and stop at the Rotunda. The place was built in 1922 and renovated in 1999. As for Columbus, people are surprised by what a nice city it is. It's the 15th largest in the country and there's a lot to do. The hip section of town is called the Short North, just north of downtown and south of campus. Get some Jeni's ice cream. There are tons of great restaurants. If you like shopping, Easton Town Center is a nice outdoor mall. The NHL's Blue Jackets open their season Friday night at Nationwide Arena against the Rangers. If you can scrounge up a ticket, go. They're finally going to be good this year, we think. \nBill can be followed on Twitter at @ brdispatch .
