By Associated Press Do you like baseball’s one-game playoff format for wild-card teams? Yes: 53% View Results \nYovani Gallardo grew up watching the Texas Rangers, often going to their ballpark and dreaming of one day pitching in big games for his local team. \n\"Even with my cousins, it's one of those things we always talked about, having that goal for myself to put on the Ranger uniform and pitch important games,\" Gallardo said. \"Obviously the one goal that we all have as an athlete, to win the World Series. This is the first step.\" \nWhen the Rangers open their first AL Division Series since 2011, Gallardo (13-11, 3.42 ERA) will be on the mound Thursday in Toronto. \n\"To have this opportunity to start Game 1, it's a big accomplishment,\" he said. \nGallardo was 10 years old when the Rangers made their playoffs debut in 1996, winning the first of three AL West titles in four seasons. \nBy time they made their only World Series appearances in 2010 and 2011, Gallardo was pitching for the Brewers. Milwaukee took him in the second round of the 2004 amateur draft out of Trimble Tech High School in Fort Worth, less than 20 miles from the Rangers' ballpark. \nThe Brewers traded Gallardo to his home team last winter for an infielder and two young pitchers. Gallardo started the opener, which like his first playoff appearance for the AL West champs was on the road. \n\"I like the body of work, I like the groundball, I like the veteran pitcher in that slot,\" first-year Rangers manager Jeff Banister said of Gallardo starting the playoff opener. \"He's been a guy for us all year that has grinded out innings for us, has kept us in ball games. He's put us some consecutive innings of zeroes also.\" \nTexas was 2-4 this season against the Blue Jays, with Gallardo getting both wins against the AL East champions. Toronto had six hits and hit .136 in 132/3 scoreless innings against the right-hander. \nGallardo was 1-2 with a 2.08 ERA in five playoff games for the Brewers. His first was his start in the 2008 NL Division Series opener against Philadelphia and Cole Hamels, the ace left-hander who is now his teammate and the Rangers' scheduled starter for the second game in Toronto. \n\"I pretty much remember everything,\" Gallardo said. \"Cole and I were just talking about that the other day. We're out there shagging, just talking about the '08 season.\" \nRoyals-Astros: When the Houston Astros had recorded the final out in Yankee Stadium on Tuesday night, they flooded onto the field in a wild celebration, all their years of losing finally a memory. \nIt looked a whole lot like the scene in Kansas City a year ago. \nNow, the long-suffering Astros will try to accomplish what the once-beleaguered Royals did by building on their wild-card victory over the Yankees. They visit Kansas City to begin a best-of-five AL Division Series against the Royals on Thursday night at Kauffman Stadium. \n\"It kind of reminds us of us last year,\" Royals third baseman Mike Moustakas said Wednesday, \"young and hungry and out there trying to prove to everybody that we deserve to be here.\" \nThe Royals certainly accomplished that 12 months ago. \nAfter ending a 29-year postseason drought, the plucky bunch of youngsters swept all the way to the World Series, where they fell in seven games to the San Francisco Giants. But it was the Royals' dramatic, extra-inning victory over the Oakland Athletics in their AL wild-card game that instilled in them a belief that they could play with anybody in baseball. \nMuch like Tuesday night in the Bronx seemed to galvanize the young Astros. \nThey clowned around before the first pitch, then took care of New York when it was time to get serious, before resuming their playful antics with a rousing 30-minute postgame party. \n\"You know, we did it in a little more dramatic fashion than they did,\" Royals manager Ned Yost said of the wild-card win, \"but they played a very solid game, took advantage of mistakes, excellent pitching and defense. Both teams play with a lot of passion and energy.\" © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
