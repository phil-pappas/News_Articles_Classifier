Brazil’s most recent win over the Chileans came in March, a 1-0 friendly victory in London which followed last year’s World Cup second round win.\nOne critical factor for Brazil could be the absence of suspended captain Neymar, who was banned after being sent off in a stormy Copa America battle with Colombia in June.\nYet Brazil has showed no sign of tension during the build-up, holding relaxed open training sessions before large crowds of journalists and fans.\nChile by contrast has drawn a veil over its preparations, with coach Jorge Sampaoli restricting press access to training to just 15 minutes each day at the team’s Juan Pinto Duran complex.\nArgentina meanwhile will get a taste of life without their superstar captain Messi when it takes on Ecuador in Buenos Aires.\nMessi, who was scapegoated in some quarters for another Argentinian tournament failure in the Copa America, is sidelined for the game after suffering a serious knee injury while playing for Barcelona last month.\nIn other matches Thursday, Uruguay will have to grapple with the absence of Suarez and Cavani as it faces a daunting trip to the thin air of La Paz to face Bolivia.\nColombia, meanwhile, which faces Uruguay in its second match next week, meets Peru in the port city of Barranquilla without Real Madrid star James Rodriguez, meaning the attacking burden is likely to fall on out-of-form Chelsea striker Radamel Falcao.\nUS blanks Panama 4-0\nKiesewetter sparked the offense with a goal and an assist in the second half, and the United States beat Panama 4-0 in CONCACAF Olympic qualifying on a rainy Tuesday.\nAlready through to the semifinal round, the Americans didn’t have much to play for and rested several of their starters.\nIn another match, Arichel Hernandez Mora scored twice, including in the 87th minute, and Cuba tied Canada 2-2. — Agencies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:39:25.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
