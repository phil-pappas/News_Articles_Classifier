But good luck stopping them all. Dakota is running over football teams both literally and figuratively this season. And it’s the depth of the Indians’ ground attack that is making the Indians so tough for opponents to contain. “Most years it’s usually one guy they’re keying on,” Dakota senior fullback Jared Packer said, “but having three backs that can run the ball hard and get yards is something that a lot of teams aren’t really used to.” Packer, along with fellow senior Greg Krulas and junior Matt Holste, have gained a combined 2,048 yards and rushed for 33 touchdowns for the Indians in a season where they’ve dominated seven of eight opponents. Dakota’ s only loss was by one point to unbeaten Lena-Winslow. In their seven wins, they’ve outscored opponents by an average of 43 points, and it’s been largely due to the performance of the backfield trio. “We really balance each other out this year,” Krulas said. “In games where our running backs can’t get it, it’ll be a fullback night. And when our fullbacks can’t get it, it’s a halfback night. Teams can’t really stop us both.” “We just kind of line up and come at people pretty quickly,” Dakota coach Rick Schmitz said. \"We’ve got a good group of kids. We’ve stayed somewhat healthy and I think that’s all part of it. We’ve got a good group up front on the offensive line and we’re pretty quick. We’re not real fast, but we’re quick. That makes a huge difference.” Krulas leads the team with 879 yards on 102 carries and he’s scored 11 touchdowns. That’s one fewer than Packer, who’s reached paydirt a team-high 12 times while grinding out 714 yards on 100 carries. Holste hasn’t gotten the ball handed to him as much, but he’s certainly made the most of his chances. He’s carried it 64 times, gained 455 yards and also scored 10 touchdowns. “We just run tough,” Krulas said. “Jared and me — I think it’s a little bit of the wrestler in us — we know how to put our shoulder down and really bust through tackles. But Matt, he’s only a junior and he’s got some of the best vision I’ve ever seen in a running back. He hits holes that you wouldn’t find. The cutbacks that he hits are unbelievable.” Page 2 of 2 - Whether it’s by pounding the ball up the middle or bouncing to the outside for extra yards, Dakota’s backs are finding plenty of room to run and rack up big yardage. Much of that is a credit to the blockers who are creating the holes. “It kind of starts in the middle with our center and our guards and they’re really important to us because we move so much,” Schmitz said. “Our guards and tackles do a lot of pulling, and now our tight ends have become a huge part of opening holes with their down blocks and kick-out blocks. Everybody has a job to do, and for us to do well, everybody’s got to do their job pretty efficiently.” And no one understands more than the running backs just how important the offensive line play has been. “Without the line we couldn’t do anything,” Packer said. “I think our line has improved a ton compared to last year. A lot of plays you see, even after the backs are on the ground, we’ve got linemen pushing guys back five yards further. “They’re smaller, but the way they get around and the way they hit the hole, there’s just always five or six yards there,” Krulas said. \"There’s a hole every time.” By Adam Kradle", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:24:33.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
