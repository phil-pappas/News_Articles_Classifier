He also was injured.\nIn addition, Palardy was good on only one of three field-goal attempts on a day when there was no wind and the temperature was 22C.\nIn all, the Argos used three punters: Alix, Dave Stala and Palardy. In Stala’s one attempt, his punt sailed just 26 yards, and the Argos quickly handed the job to Palardy.\nThis makes five kickers that the Argos have used as fill-ins since Waters got injured in the first game of the season. Stala, Ronnie Pfeffer, Michael Palardy , Justin Palardy (no relation) and Alix.\nAlix, who suffered a hamstring injury later in the game, said he was having trouble with his drops prior to the kick.\n“The ball felt sticky and I couldn’t release the ball right,” said Alix, who said he first hurt his hamstring about a month ago with Ottawa. “I couldn’t get my leg straight. I’m not trying to find an excuse.”\nSome questioned why the Argos would release Pfeffer when Waters returned, but the Argos say they didn’t have any room on the practice roster. Pfeffer landed in Ottawa, where he sits on the Redblacks’ injured list.\nWhen Waters suffered a recurrence of his first injury, the Argos put in an emergency call to American Michael Palardy, who didn’t turn out to be so good at field goals.\nSo, a few days later, Justin Palardy arrived to handle field goals.\nThe Argos then released Michael Palardy (due to import-non-import ratio reasons) after a one-game punting trial, in which he averaged an impressive 48 yards on six punts.\nAlix came in and in his first game in Ottawa on Oct. 6, he seemed okay, averaging 43.3 on six punts. Then it all went wrong in Montreal. Two of his punts were shanked, one going just 18 yards.\nPalardy normally doesn’t punt, but his one attempt travelled 52 yards, and he says he’s up for the dual kicking/punting roles.\n“I can punt,” Palardy said. “When I first came into the league, I was Hamilton’s punter (in 2010) and I punted at last year’s camp (in Ottawa). It’s just like riding a bike really: Step back, catch it, kick it.”\nNOTE: It was confirmed Tuesday that the Argos will host the defending Grey Cup champion Calgary Stampeders on Saturday (4 p.m.) at Hamilton’s Tim Hortons Field.\n ", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:11:25.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
