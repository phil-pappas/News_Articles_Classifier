That’s the norm for this Ramapo soccer quartet these days; they always seem to be together. \nFriday evening, a scoreboard still lit up under the quickly darkening sky signifying the Green Raiders’ 2-0 win over the Braves served as the backdrop. It provided more proof of this group of talented defenders’ recent dominance. \nTold it was their 10th straight shutout and 12th of the year, Scaglione and her teammates looked at each other momentarily and humbly laughed. The group was unaware of their shutout streak. \nOr that it had been over a month (Sept. 16 in 1-0 loss to Northern Highlands) since an opponent had scored on them. \n“We definitely like to have them,” Scaglione said of posting zeros, feats that also would not be possible if not for the play of goalie Lizzy Stellakis. “We just try keeping the other team’s goal totals as low as possible.” \nThere are many reasons behind the success of the Green Raiders defense, particularly in the last season and a half in which it has accumulated 29 shutouts in 38 games, and allowed just three goals in 14 matches this year. \nThere’s talent and trust. Chemistry and communication. Experience and selflessness. \nThere’s coordination and confidence. Racano said they’re “tenacious.” Brogan added they’re “focused.” \n“But tell them the real reason,” coach Paul Heenehan said, laughing, while joining the conversation with four of his seniors. “They don’t give up goals because they’re scared of me. That’s the bottom line.” \nMore laughter ensued, partly because the longtime coach was joking. But partly, too, because he wasn’t. A lot of thought and a lot of work has gone into this lights-out defense. \nIt’s Heenehan who created a completely revamped system at the beginning of last season, after the Raiders previously had been a more offensive-oriented team in years past. \nThe “umbrella” defense, as Heenehan now calls it, is a play off the four-back system. And while it might feature four backs, he prohibits anyone from ever calling it a “flat back” system. \n“It should never be flat. If we’re flat, we’re wrong,” said Heenehan, whose current defense is predicated around the speed and versatility of the Cornell-bound Adams and features movements and shifts dependent on other defenders’ runs upfield. “And as soon as we introduced it last year, it clicked immediately. \n“The goal this year is to shut people out.” \nA 2-1 loss to Indian Hills on Sept. 12, they say, served as the wake-up call they needed. Heenehan said it was a “perfect indicator” for his team that the past, referring to last year’s 17 shutouts and run to the Group 2 final, meant nothing. \n“From that game on, the mentality was how we can’t just go into games thinking we’re going to win,” said Brogan. “We had to work even harder at that point.” \nWhat also makes Ramapo’s “umbrella” defense, and Ramapo (11-2-1) in general, so successful is the freedom Scaglione, Brogan, Racano and Adams all have. \nThey don’t just prevent goals, they help create them, too. \nScaglione, headed to Towson, takes essentially nearly every restart kick. Brogan handles almost every throw-in. \nRacano, bound for Lehigh, is a frequent threat to make long runs down the sideline. And Adams, well, “she just does everything else,” Scaglione said with a laugh. “She’s Abby Adams. She’s just a wall.” \n“She controls the whole defense,” said Brogan, also a star basketball player at Ramapo. “She tells us when to step up, tells us when to drop, communicates who has who. She keeps us all in line.” \nIt’s an often-unheralded group, and that’s OK with them. \nRight now, they’re subscribing to the old adage, “defense wins championships.” \nAnd the way the Green Raiders back line is playing, Ramapo could be in line for a couple of them in the coming weeks. \n“I think they’re enjoying what they’re accomplishing,” Heenehan said. “But it’s almost as if they’re afraid to enjoy it too much because there’s so much left to play for.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:11:02.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
