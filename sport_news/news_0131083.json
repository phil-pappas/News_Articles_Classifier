The longtime coach hammers the sentiment home to his group early in a season.\n\"I would never tell an upperclassman that it is a rebuilding year,\" Duddy said. \"I don't think a senior wants to hear that it is a rebuilding year. That doesn't work.\"\nScott Kohler first remembers the message being delivered when he was a sophomore. The Knights had lost a lot of seniors to graduation, and many assumed the upcoming year would be one full of growing pains.\nNorth Penn ended up winning 14 games and earned the seventh seed in the District 1 Class AAA tournament.\nMore coverage Latest high school sports scores Local high school standings More coverage: New Jersey high school sports More coverage: Southeastern Pa. high school sports So, no, the Knights don't do rebuilding.\n\"We don't ever look at our team and say, 'Oh well, this isn't the year,' \" the senior midfielder said. \"No, this is the year.\"\nA similar uncertainty surrounded this campaign. With 15 seniors gone - five who went on to play in college - how would the team fare in the always tough Suburban One Continental Conference?\nAt 11-4-2, the Knights have answered the doubters.\n\"The expectation when you put on the jersey on game day is to win,\" senior defender Kyle Shue said. \"We don't care who we play. We expect to win. We are expected to at any level.\"\nWin.\nUnder Duddy, that's just what North Penn has done. The Knights have missed the district playoffs only twice in his 16 seasons, and Duddy cannot remember the last time his team finished a season below .500.\nThe recipe for this success is not one filled with superstars and flashy players. Rather, North Penn teams are filled with hard workers, squads that grind a game out in the midfield and outhustle their opponent.\n\"We like to defend, like to get behind the ball, like to tackle. It is something we take pride in,\" Shue said. \"The goal scorers get the big headlines, but we have a lot of guys who like to do the little things, do the dirty work.\"\nBut there is one thing that has eluded this consistently tough-to-beat team. The Knights have underperformed in the postseason, and haven't earned a state playoff berth since 2005.\n\"We keep knocking on the door and hopefully we are going to break through it,\" Duddy said.\nTwo weeks ago, the Knights looked set to break it. The only losses North Penn had suffered were to undefeated Central Bucks East.\nNow, explosive striker Mike Kohler is out with an ankle injury, starting keeper Jordan Katz suffered a concussion, and the team has dropped two of its last three.\n\"We were all definitely feeling great and feeling good about potential for this year - this may be our year. This could be our year for states even,\" senior midfielder Colin Jerome said. \"I don't think our mentality has changed just because we've had a bad week.\"\nNorth Penn will refocus, regroup.\nThe Knights certainly won't be rebuilding. They don't need to.\nrallysports@phillynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:22:51.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
