It's back to business as usual. And with that, coach Justin Fuente and his players addressed reporters at the team's weekly media luncheon today.\nHere are a few quick thoughts.\n-- The first question for Fuente was about the immediate aftermath of Saturday's 37-24 win over Ole Miss. Instead of explaining what happened, I'll just let Fuente do the honors.\n“Well, I walked out and obviously there were a lot of people still at the stadium celebrating and having a good time,\" Fuente said. \"I didn’t need to go be with them to revel in that or take pride in that. I went ahead and headed home, but I thought it was really cool that there were a bunch of people out there still hanging out, having a good time, celebrating the victory.\n\"I went home and obviously the first thing that happens is your telephone starts to blow up and starts to buzz. I was just telling Paxton (Lynch), I actually this morning just called my wife and said, ‘Babe, if you need me, just call the front desk, call Sherri (Schwartz, assistant to the head coach). But I’m turning this thing off.’ I just turned it off and put it in a drawer. So it was an outpouring of support, and I appreciate that -- from the coaches to former players, and people in the community that just wanted to say job well done, basically. And that was a neat thing, and I returned every single one of them. It was a really nice deal.\n\"Then I went home and relaxed with my family. Watched a little bit of games. Put the kids to bed. Then my wife and I and a couple of friends slipped out for about an hour and a half, and just kind of relaxed. It was a relatively empty place, but there were a few people in there and they were very complimentary.\n\"The thing that sticks out, and somebody asked me about this the other day: It’s one thing to say, ‘Great job coach, great win.’ Those sorts of things. It’s another thing when somebody says -- and I don’t take the credit for this -- but when somebody says, ‘Thank you for what you’ve done for the city.’ That brings a different tone, you know? And it’s not me. It’s a whole group of people. It’s a group of kids, it’s a group of coaches, administrators, the university. But at least for me, that’s taken a little bit differently than, ‘Nice win, coach.’ ”\n-- I wrote about this in today's paper , but one of the biggest challenges Memphis will face this week will be dealing with the attention. They've gotten some of it to this point, but nothing like this. Asked about that today, Fuente said he needs to set a good example. Remember: He's being rumored for open jobs with Power Five teams. He has to handle the spotlight just like players do.\nFuente said he addressed this at a team meeting yesterday. He spoke about the hype honestly. He told players that he had called coaches to ask them about handling it. He got advice from former Texas coach Mack Brown (who will call Friday's game for ESPN) and TCU coach Gary Patterson. Then Fuente relayed an analogy to reporters that he said he would illustrate to the team later today.\n\"We try to paint the picture of this,\" Fuente said. \"After the last several wins, I’ve walked into the locker room and the kids have been dancing. Singing and dancing and having a great time. Not one time have I walked in that locker room at halftime and seen them singing and dancing. And that’s where we’re at right now. We’re at halftime. We're at halftime of the season. We have a lot of work to do.\"\n-- Fuente was asked about the defense's improvement last weekend. What changed? He pointed to two main factors: Pressuring the quarterback and preventing big plays. After the first two drives, he said, Ole Miss racked up yards but rarely in big chunks. Even big-chunk plays were slants or crossing routes in front of -- not behind -- the safeties. Fuente also praised the coaching staff, including defensive coordinator Galen Scott, for putting together a tremendous game plan and ensuring that it was executed well.\n-- In other odds and ends: I reached out to an ESPN spokesperson about television ratings for Saturday's game. He said Memphis-Ole Miss, and the other game at that time slot between Northwestern and Iowa, pulled a combined 2.3 rating on ABC. The games were shown regionally, so Memphis was on ABC in some areas of the country and ESPN2 in others. The network does not have figures on how one game fared over multiple networks. But, there you go. (Just for comparison's sake: Ohio State and Penn State received a 3.5 rating on ABC on Saturday night.)\n-- As of this writing, Memphis is an 11-point favorite over Tulsa in Vegas. Sounds about right. I'm more interested to see the over/under number. These are two high-octane offenses that should put up a TON of points.\n-- The American Athletic Conference announced that the Halloween game between Memphis and Tulane will kick off at 6 p.m. and be televised on CBS Sports Network. (Also, for future reference: The other TBA game times will likely also be announced 12 days before. So we should have a game time for Navy next Monday afternoon, for example, and so on.)", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/JUuqRaFj7MM"], "published": "2015-10-19T22:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:32:57.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
