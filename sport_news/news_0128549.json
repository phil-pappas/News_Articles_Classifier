Seeking support from the saint community as well as the local, Bharati assured that by mid 2016 and within the next four years clear impact of the project would be visible to all. Terming deployment of special Territorial Army for the cause of Ganga as a step that would give a major boost to the clean Ganga drive, Bharati said the Territorial Army played a significant role in increasing green cover and now it would do the same in protecting the Ganga from getting polluted. She also met Gayatri Shantikunj spiritual ideologues Dr Pranav Pandya and Shail Jiji regarding the project. Lauding the efforts of the Gayatri Shantikunj for its clean Ganga drive, currently being carried out from the Gangotri till the Ganga Sagar, Bharati said three phases of the drive had been successful without any government or major financial support. “The way Gayatri Shantikunj volunteers are carrying out this cleanliness and awareness drive along the banks of the Ganga should be replicated in the Namami Gange project too. The government alone can’t make the Ganga clean as it needs help from institutions like the Gayatri Shantikunj to achieve the desired results,” Bharati said. She was also briefed about the cleanliness drive by Dev Sanskriti University, flagship educational wing of Gayatri Shantikunj, Dr Chinmay Pandya, Shefali and Kedar Prasad Dubey.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:09:40.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
