Posted: Thursday, October 1, 2015 3:37 pm Men's soccer looks to get their first ACC win against Clemson Miguel Pineda, sports staff writer collegiatetimes.com | 0 comments \nThe Virginia Tech men’s soccer team has had a tough run this season, filled with both close games that slipped away and also dominating victories over talented competition. \nWhether it was losing against No. 3 UNC at home in double overtime or it was on the road beating No. 10 Xavier, this team has pushed itself to be better. \nDespite a 4-3-1 record, Virginia Tech is optimistic about the remainder of the season. After a rough 4-1 loss against Boston College, the Hokies will head to South Carolina to face Clemson. \nThe Tigers this year have compiled a 7-1-2 record and are third in the Atlantic division. Clemson has also recently been ranked in the top five in four national polls, making the team a very tough opponent for the Hokies. To add to Virginia Tech’s battle, the men have to play Clemson at home, where the Tigers have not lost yet this season. \nAlthough this season has featured many ups and downs for the Hokies, there is plenty of good news. Virginia Tech has six players who have scored more than two goals this year, and goalie Ben Lundgaard has 25 saves, meaning that Virginia Tech can dish out goals as well as protect against them. Despite Virginia Tech sitting in the fourth spot in the Coastal division, a win against Clemson could potentially move them up in the standings. \nInterestingly enough, the Hokies and the Tigers have had a fairly even history against each other. Of the 12 games these teams have played against each other, Virginia Tech has won three, tied four and lost five. \nThe last time these two teams played was Sept. 23, 2013, at Thompson Field. The final score was 0-0 in double overtime. The last time the Hokies beat Clemson was Sept. 20, 2009, at Clemson 4-2. \nEven though Clemson is ranked higher, the history between these two teams shows that it can be an even matchup. \nThe Hokies' aggressive scoring style has helped them to propel over some of their competition this season and will be key against Clemson. \nAlessandro Mion, a redshirt junior, had two goals during the Hokies' recent win against Delaware. After playing defensively, he moved to offense and has earned himself a 0.833 shots on goal percentage. \nSophomore Ricardo John, an explosive forward, has been taking numerous shots per game and scored Virginia Tech’s lone goal against Boston College. \nThe team’s leading scorer this year, Merlin Baus, is also expected to help the offense out. With his four goals and four assists this year, his play is key to the Hokies' offensive abilities. Defensively the Hokies must work as a complete unit in order to defend against Clemson’s power offense, which has 24 goals so far this season. \nThis game would be a huge victory for Virginia Tech. It would make a statement that the Hokies are contenders for the ACC championship and can play against big soccer programs. \nA win on the road at Clemson could potentially change Virginia Tech’s season for the better. After the Hokies road trip to South Carolina, they come back home to play West Virginia at Thompson Field. Clemson’s Riggs Field is celebrating its 100th anniversary and will have a special ceremony before the game starts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T22:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T20:57:26.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
