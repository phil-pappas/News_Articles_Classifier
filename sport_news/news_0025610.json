The NFL allows players to wear pink during the month of October. Williams' mother, Sandra Hill, passed away in May 2014. \nAccording to ESPN, Williams chose to dye the tips of his hair pink and reportedly bought 53 mammograms at hospitals in Charlotte, where he played most of his career, and his current city of Pittsburgh. Williams’ mother died at the age of 53. \nTo read the original story from ESPN, click here .
