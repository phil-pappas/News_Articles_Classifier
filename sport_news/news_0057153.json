(AP) — A man who was beaten by San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies after he fled on a stolen horse has been arrested again.\nFrancis Pusok was jailed Wednesday on suspicion of assault — a day after an Apple Valley homeowner said Pusok punched him in the nose and knocked him down.\nThe homeowner told deputies he'd evicted members of Pusok's family who'd been squatting and was changing the locks when Pusok arrived.\nAn email to Pusok's lawyer wasn't immediately returned.\nPusok also faces more than a dozen charges after he allegedly led authorities on a three-hour car, foot and horse chase in April. It ended with Pusok being punched and kicked on the ground.\nPusok reached a $650,000 settlement with the county and three deputies were charged with assault.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:07:50.671+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
