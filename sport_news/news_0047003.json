I helped start Deep Creek Flyfishers, one of the biggest fly-fishing clubs in California, and I even taught basic fly-fishing classes for a number of years. I have tossed flies for a variety of fresh and saltwater species all over the West, landed a couple of northern pike on big gaudy streamers in Minnesota, and even caught a lake trout on a dry fly in Saskatchewan. Just one. Now please don’t think that I’m some sort of expert. I’ve decided I’m more like the blind pig in a forest with a big acorn crop. I used to think that I was a pretty good trout fisherman and could reliably get a few bass, bluegill or crappie on flies. Since I’ve been trying to catch carp of flies, I’ve decided that trout are truly very stupid fish, which is probably why fly-fishermen target these species. To make ourselves feel better, we huddle together and talk about how difficult the fishing has been and write books explaining the intricacies and difficulties of fly-fishing for trout. I won’t go so far as to say we are just pretending and deluding ourselves about the trout, but I will say that when compared to carp, even I’m a trout Pied Piper. I recently did a story for California Fly Fisher magazine that detailed all of the carp I have ever landed on flies, by hook or crook, but it was still a very short story because the total is fewer than five. This is a sore spot with me considering how often I try to catch carp, so I won’t say how many fewer than five. If you press me on the issue, you might get a hand gesture that could be misconstrued as an answer to the question by someone naive. Esteemed scientists have said that after we humans manage to wipe ourselves off the planet along with most other species that at least two animals will survive — carp and cockroaches, one on land and one in the water. Carp are already found just about everywhere and they compete well against most other species so the takeover might happen before we are gone. In the interim, I’d sure like to figure out how to catch them consistently. They are big, strong fish that pull with more vigor and intensity than most other freshwater gamefish. The few I’ve hooked have reminded me of hard-pulling ocean fish like bonito. So I try to catch them every time I see they are present where I’m fishing. I might go to a local county or city park lake to catch tiny bluegill to try and ease jangled nerves for an evening. Then a carp cruises past, or I see them stalking along a shoreline, obviously feeding, and I frustrate myself skulking after them until I can’t see because of the dark. I come home in worse shape than when I left. Even the Labrador senses the frustration and stays away from me. Carp have a widely varying diet that consists of vegetable and meat forms. They might siphon algae off the face of a rock one minute, and then share a peanut butter and jelly sandwich some kid hurled into the water the next minute. They will eat aquatic insects and crawdads and even minnows. In fact, there are not too many things they can’t process as food. So a fly tied well to imitate some form of food in a particular park lake should interest carp. Right? That’s mostly theory in my experience. Yet, there is a growing legion of fly anglers across Southern California who have “discovered” this gamefish. Many call them “golden bonefish” because we fly anglers have snobbed up our sport a little and catching a lowly carp seems beneath us. At least until you actually catch one, and then you realize you are battling an amazing fish, a golden bonefish, one of the mostly highly evolved, intelligent fish species on the planet. Consistently catching them on flies now qualifies you for MENSA membership. I have been fortunate to know Glenn Ueda of Huntington Beach for a long time. He taught me how to catch Lake Skinner striped bass on fly-lined baits on two- and four-pound test spinning gear decades ago and the tactic still works like a charm. He’s a versatile, expert angler who is at home with a fly rod as a jig stick. He is one of the best anglers I have ever seen at figuring out how to catch any species of fish, fresh or salt, in any given situation. An avid fly angler, Glenn has fished most of the popular species from bonefish and permit on tropical flats, to trout on the most famous rivers in the West. He has caught yellowtail and yellowfin and bonito of flies. Stripers and largemouth bass aren’t safe when he’s around. He’s one of a handful of fly anglers who regularly catches corbina in the surf with fly gear, and now that he’s retired, he’s just getting better, if that is actually possible. Fishing with Glenn is a humbling experience, especially when you think you are pretty good at something and he comes to your home turf and shows you how it’s done by a real master. I mention Glenn here because I have been trying to catch carp off and on with fly gear, mostly unsuccessfully, for decades. Glenn decided to try to sport for the first time this year because we have so many urban waters near our homes that are jugged with big carp. Between March and this week, I think Glenn is now over 100 carp, including a number of “doubles,” as the British call carp over 10 pounds. The point in all of this is that carp are a great gamefish increasingly being admired by true expert anglers, and I didn’t want my inability to catch them stop you from getting into the game.
