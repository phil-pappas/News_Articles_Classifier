The defense held Miami to just three points in the second half and the pressure applied by the defensive line was a key ingredient to the Bearcats success.\n\"We won the ballgame on defense in the second half, there's no doubt about that,\" UC coach Tommy Tuberville said.\nTuberville also praised a defensive line that controlled the line of scrimmage with three and four-man fronts.\nDefensive tackle Alex Pace, out of Glenville High School, was consistently disruptive.\n\"Being disruptive was needed,\" Pace said. \"I tried to be a strong and powerful guy. I used my abilities to bull rush that guard, and make plays on the quarterback in the backfield. They mostly tried to single block me, but it didn't work.\"\nPace finished with three tackles in the victory. He has 15 tackles in five games.\nWinning behind the defense is new to UC. It gives up 30 points and nearly 400 yards per game. One of the biggest disappointments was last week's 53-46 loss to Memphis.\n\"That was a bad game for us,\" Pace said. \"We bounced back.\"\nPace is one of many Northeast Ohio natives worth watching in Division I college football.
