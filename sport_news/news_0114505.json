Safety Shalom Luani fumbled an onside kick and the Beavers recovered. Granted, Luani responded by intercepting OSU quarterback Seth Collins the next possession and returning it 84 yards for a touchdown, then grabbing another, en route to Pac-12 defensive player of the week honors.\nBut on WSU's penultimate offensive series, punter Zach Charme got his attempt blocked, which led to a Beavers touchdown that made the final score appear respectable in a game that was never close. \n\"Yeah, we need to address it, and we need to do it in a punitive fashion,\" said WSU coach Mike Leach on Monday of the special team woes. \"And some of those guys on those teams need to feel very uncomfortable. We'll see that they do.\"\nAsked to evaluate special teams at the midway point, Leach offered an honest assessment. \n\"I think spotty,\" he said. \"I think our scheme is simple enough and you know we're breaking in a bunch of new people. Then when we really focus and do our jobs, we play really well. But then when we don't I think our focus breaks down, I mean they're too big. And they're too inexcusable. The same people who play really well the two or three plays before, then all of a sudden one play, you'll have five guys take a play off.\"\nThe latest breakdowns were noteworthy in part because the Cougars have struggled on special teams under Leach (and going back years). In 2014, special teams coach Eric Russell was fired in October after WSU allowed two kickoff return touchdowns, and missed a potential game-winning, 19-yard field goal in the final minute of a 60-59 loss to Cal.\nAfter serving in an interim role, Eric Mele was promoted to a full-time special teams coach this season. But the results haven't changed much. In a 37-34 win over Rutgers, receiver Janarion Grant in the fourth quarter had a 100-yard kickoff return for a touchdown and a 55-yard punt return score that gave the Scarlet Knights a lead with less than two minutes remaining before quarterback Luke Falk orchestrated a 90-yard game-winning scoring drive. \nAgainst Cal, a fake punt proved disastrous when Charme fumbled and it was returned for a score. Wide receiver Kyrin Priester fumbled a punt in the second half of the season-opening loss to FCS-level Portland State. And well, you're starting to see the pattern. \nWSU ranks 62nd nationally in kickoff return defense and 113th in punt return defense, by average. A bright spot has been sophomore kicker Erik Powell, who is 7-for-10 in field goals. \nIf the Cougars (4-2, 2-1 Pac-12) hope to continue trending upward, fixing the special teams, or at least, limiting the scope of the errors, must come next. \n\"The biggest thing is it needs to be an identity for us to be committed to special teams,\" Leach said. \"And I know coach Mele is. And several key players are but the things is we need to make it compelling to everybody because we've done some really good things on special teams. It's just the errors have been gigantic.\"\nStanford gametime set, will College Gameday take notice? \nWSU will host No. 10 Stanford Oct. 31 at 7:30 p.m. Pacific Time in a game televised by ESPN.\nReports suggest WSU, along with seven other campuses, is a candidate to host College Gameday, the hyper-popular ESPN morning show led by hosts Rece Davis, Lee Corso, Kirk Herbstreit and Desmond Howard. \nThe show has never visited Pullman despite the Ol' Crimson WSU flag being waived on 170 consecutive shows dating back to Oct. 18, 2003. \n\"It's kind of a big deal if they come to campus, I guess,\" Leach said. \"I'm sure there would be Coug flags flying all over, as there is on College Gameday... it's difficult to watch, because we're always preparing for a game. We're always getting ready to do our game, so I hear about College Gameday from my relatives and stuff. If we were on College Gameday that would be exciting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:47:46.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
