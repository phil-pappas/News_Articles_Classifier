Barrett running the show, it remains a mystery why the Ohio State coach stuck with struggling Cardale Jones as his starter for so long. \nBarrett, who replaced the ineffective Jones last weekend, was named the starter by Meyer, a move that likely will be permanent after he backed up that performance with another sterling effort, guiding the defending national champions to a 49-7 thrashing of Rutgers at High Point Solutions Stadium in front of a sellout crowd of 53,111. \nMeyer said Barrett — the redshirt sophomore quarterback who led the Buckeyes into the playoff picture last year before a fractured ankle ended his season prematurely — only now has begun to resemble the player who finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting last year. \n“I just didn’t play well [during training camp],” Barrett said. “It was all on me.”\nBarrett’s rounding into form now, and he appears to be the antidote for what has been ailing inconsistent top-ranked Ohio State. \nAfter throwing for three touchdowns and rushing for two more, not to mention accounting for 324 all-purpose yards, Barrett has found pay dirt nine times in the last two weeks — one more score than Jones produced as the starter over the season’s first seven weeks. \n“That’s just who he is — everything he does seems to somewhat be perfect,” running back Ezekiel Elliott said. \nRutgers (3-4, 1-3 Big Ten) is closer to the cellar than the penthouse, but Ohio State struggled with Indiana, Northern Illinois and Maryland with Jones under center. The Buckeyes (8-0, 4-0), the first unanimous preseason No. 1 in the 65-year history of the Associated Press college football poll, finally look deserving of the honor. \nNot only was Barrett excelling, but the defense shut down Rutgers, harassing quarterback Chris Laviano all evening.\nWide receiver Braxton Miller turned in a dynamic performance — including an acrobatic 45-yard reception in which Miller lost the ball on the way down, but somehow regathered it while lying on his back with a defender on top of him. \nRutgers committed a comedy of errors. On the Scarlet Knights’ opening drive, kicker Kyle Federico hit the left upright on a 29-yard field goal attempt. They had a punt blocked, committed seven penalties for 55 yards (Ohio State wasn’t charged with any), Laviano threw an interception and Piscataway, N.J., felt like Columbus for large stretches, chants of “O-H-I-O” filling the stadium.\n“It felt like a home game for us,” said wide receiver Michael Thomas, who caught a 50-yard touchdown pass from Barrett in the first half. \nBarrett’s only hiccup was twice running into teammates, once causing a fumble some already have dubbed “The Buck Fumble.” But, perhaps, Ohio State fans are not used to a quarterback as potent with his legs as his arm. \nBarrett forces the opposition to pick its poison. His sleight of hand in the read-option gave Rutgers fits — the Scarlet Knights shut down Elliott in the first half, but Barrett ran wild — and with the box stacked to stop the run, receivers ran free. \nElliott dominated the second half, rushing for 125 of his 142 yards, as Rutgers protected against Barrett. \n“Any time you got a guy who can throw and run, that’s a problem,” Meyer said. “That’s what J.T. gives us.” \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under college football ,  ohio state buckeyes ,  rutgers scarlet knights", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T13:53:23.802+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
