(AP) - A street art campaign replacing the ubiquitous handicapped symbol with a modernized, action-oriented logo is catching on with officials across the country.\nProponents see it as an opportunity to emphasize people's abilities rather than their disabilities.\nThe new icon has been adopted in various cities. Last year, New York became the first state to replace the universal symbol. Connecticut could be the next.\nDespite the support, the upgraded symbol faces opposition from some in the disability rights community. And the international body that oversees such standards has come out against the new symbol.\nThe now well-known logo of a stick figure sitting rigidly in a wheelchair was first designed by Danish graphic arts designer in 1968 and later revamped. The United Nations designated it an international symbol of disability in 1974.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:17:06.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
