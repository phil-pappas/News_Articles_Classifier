No. 3 Maryland led the way, followed by No. 13 Michigan State, No. 15 Indiana, No. 17 Wisconsin and No. 24 Purdue. Michigan was the top team among others receiving votes. Iowa and Ohio State also got votes.\nThe Big 12 matched the Big Ten with five teams in the poll, while the ACC had four (with three of the top six, including North Carolina, sharing the No. 1 spot with Kentucky). The SEC and Pac-12 had three each.\nMSU coach Tom Izzo, the dean of Big Ten coaches entering his 21st season, cited the depth of quality in saying the league might be as good as it has ever been.\nAnd Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany brought up nation-leading attendance and seven Final Four teams in the past seven seasons in asserting: \"Big Ten basketball is about as healthy as it could be.\"\n■ Big turtle on campus: Some analysts have pegged Mark Turgeon's Maryland Terrapins as a possible No. 1 team, and the Terps got five first-place votes in the coaches poll. Maryland will have earned it if it's still ranked near the top at the end.\n\"We have an unbelievably tough schedule,\" Turgeon said. \"We've challenged our guys. And then we had an unusually hard Big Ten schedule, I think. It goes in cycles. I think we play six of the top-seven teams on the road.\n\"So we have a really tough schedule. I think we'll stay humble because of our schedule, which will make us continue to work hard.\"\nMaryland's nonleague opponents include UNC, Georgetown and Connecticut. In Big Ten play, Maryland faces MSU once, at the Breslin Center on Jan. 23. Maryland also travels to Indiana for their only meeting, on March 5.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nHarbaugh, Izzo shared ideas, respect, support over years\n■ Big jump: Crean said former Michigan big man Max Bielfeldt has been a \"tremendous addition to our team,\" and highly touted freshman big man Thomas Bryant made enormous strides in his first summer in the program despite a sore arch in a foot that cost him some time.\n\"I've never had anybody that made the jumps he made athletically,\" Crean said of Bryant. \"He went up 9 inches in his vertical jump in seven weeks, and (I've) got guys that have not gone 9 inches in four years.\"\n■ Football and basketball scheduling: Delany said the Big Ten is seeking more prime-time, non-Saturday opportunities for football scheduling \"within the tolerances of (schools') ability to host those games.\"\nOn the basketball front, he said a league schedule of more than 18 games is unlikely, and also that there hasn't been enough support for protecting rivalries in basketball.\nMSU and U-M will meet once this season, in Ann Arbor. The 2016-17 league schedule has not been announced, but it's possible the Spartans and Wolverines could meet twice again.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nLess time demands on players? 'It's a joke,' Izzo says\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nU-M's Beilein: 'We're not close,' 'gap to make up'", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/326f7eb2019422a6859dd15bf42c2b8faee9997b/c=816-0-4080-3264/local/-/media/2015/10/15/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635805067238434913-AP-Michigan-Practice-Basketb.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5ea615877a756dbf84ab85a2d7bbea6aeb376da7/c=101-0-701-600/local/-/media/2015/10/15/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635804650838844425-harbaugh.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8a453994630c2bcc4343b109144f9f1813e6d69b/c=150-0-2544-2394/local/-/media/2015/10/15/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635805024156730750-AP-Big-Ten-Media-Day-Basketb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T06:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:27:55.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
