Shannon Green Contact Reporter Orlando Sentinel George O'Leary has stepped down as interim athletics director and the school is searching for a new AD \nOffseason moves and injuries already marked UCF’s 2015 season as one of change, but George O’Leary’s announcement Monday that he’d step down as the school’s interim athletics director suggests this season also is about letting go. \n“Right now, I want to coach football and, again, I looked at the AD thing and put my time into it, but it’s not something that basically I’m gonna have a real interest in and that’s why I made that decision,” O’Leary said Monday. “And again, I’ll say it, it was my decision alone in making that, and I’m fulfilling the contract in doing that.” \nO’Leary, who recently signed a contract extension through 2020, said he signed a contract with the school that gave him until Oct. 15 to decide whether he wanted to pursue the athletics director position full-time. \nUCF has not responded to an Orlando Sentinel public information request submitted in May seeking all football coaches’ contracts. \nThe school announced it has hired a national search agency to fill the athletics director position while O’Leary focuses on mentoring the football team. \nGrant Heston, UCF vice president for communications and marketing, will oversee the search and athletics department operations for the university.

That turnout was the lowest at a home game since Nov. 25, 2011,, when UCF beat UTEP 31-14 in front of 21,127. Orlando News Now: George O'Leary steps down as UCF interim athletics director \nGeorge O'Leary is expected to announce that he will step down as UCF's interim athletics director during his weekly press conference today, two sources told the Orlando Sentinel. \nGeorge O'Leary is expected to announce that he will step down as UCF's interim athletics director during his weekly press conference today, two sources told the Orlando Sentinel. See more videos \nO'Leary replaced Todd Stansbury, who left to lead Oregon State's athletic department this summer. UCF President John Hitt told the Orlando Sentinel last month O'Leary's term would run through December, and then the school would evaluate his performance and to see if the football coach still wanted to pursue the job full-time. \nHe became the first acting head coach to juggle athletic director duties at UCF since Gene McDowell and was among a small fraternity of football coaches who have taken on the daunting challenge, including Barry Alvarez at Wisconsin and Tom Osborne at Nebraska. \nThe dual role initially presented an exciting new challenge for the 69-year-old coach. But O’Leary’s attention was drawn farther into football as the Knights started to collapse under the foundation of a young team forced by an excessive amount of injuries to starters. \nOverall, UCF has used 26 first-time starters this season, the most of any team in the nation. \n“You know what the challenge is, . . . [it’s] what we’re used to,” O’Leary said. “We’re used to 30 wins in the last three years and all [of a] sudden it’s like a culture shock the other way. You’re losing and so you’re trying to change that type of thing. Same with our fan base. You know, they’re basically spoiled a little bit as far as some things, and we’re going through some growing pains right now, which is what it amounts to, but the kids, you just got to everyday, go on the field and get one step better.” \nUCF will try to take the next step forward at undefeated Temple Saturday. Kickoff is at 7:30 p.m. and the game will air on CBS Sports Network. \nE-mail Shannon Green at sgreen@orlandosentinel.com.
