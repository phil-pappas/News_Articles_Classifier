Mike Pence, will now launch a national search for a replacement. Gorajec’s assistant will fill the role in the meantime. \nWeatherwax said nearby states like Ohio have done a better job of promoting the sport. He said the next executive director will focus more on “economic development.” \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:47:37.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
