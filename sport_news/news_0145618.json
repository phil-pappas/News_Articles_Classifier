Under this kind of pressure, some teams might struggle to live up to the hype. Paramus, however, is not even listening. \n\"Honestly, outside factors like rankings are never a concern,\" head coach MariaElena Bellinger said. \"We are focused on what we need to do and what is in our own control. The only rankings that count are the final rankings at the end of the season, when all of the playing is done.\" \nStill, Paramus is off to a remarkable start. They leveraged their impressive record to the No. 3 spot in the most recent Top 20 by The Record. \nA strong nucleus of stars makes this team go, starting with the captains, Maria Bellinger and Rianna McNamee. Bellinger, the coach's daughter and reigning Player of the Year as chosen by The Record, entered the season holding the Paramus records for kills in a single season (462) and career (1,093), marks she set in 2014. \nMcNamee has played a role in making things run smoothly from her middle hitter position. \n\"We have already made a few adjustments to the lineup in order to find the combination that works best,\" coach Bellinger said. \"We are led by our captains.\" \nA few other seniors and juniors are making their presence felt. The efforts of seniors like setter Kristi Garino and defensive specialist Lauren Andersen, along with those of juniors such as outside hitter Alexandra Ehrenberg, middle hitter Dominique Petruzzella and libero Tiffany Foo, validate Bellinger's claim that the team is \"receiving contributions at all positions.\" \nSophomore opposite hitter Kerri Dolack is a key cog in this year's Paramus machine, and should continue to develop into a pivotal player for Spartan success. \nThe team's goals are both lofty and reasonable. Each of the past three years, Paramus has come tantalizingly close to garnering a state championship. Whether it was a loss in the State Group 3 semifinal like in 2012 and 2013 or the sectional-final defeat last season, the Spartans have been within striking distance of the coveted title in recent years. \nThis time around, Paramus, which finished 2014 with a 24-5 record, is looking to get over the hump. \n\"As in any year, of course, the team has their sights set on winning championships,\" Bellinger said. \"The seniors are determined to overcome the hurdle and earn a state championship.\" \nParamus has been tearing its opponents apart, utilizing its prolific offense to gain a very competitive advantage this year. \n\"Our greatest strength is our offensive dominance,\" Bellinger said. \"When we are in control running our offensive, we have multiple weapons that are difficult to stop.\" \nEverything worked smoothly Oct. 1 when the Spartans defeated No. 4 Northern Valley/Demarest, 27-25, 19-25, 25-15, taking revenge on the team that has knocked Paramus out of the state tournament each of the past two seasons. \nBellinger will look to continue exploiting holes in other teams' defenses, but is also cognizant of where the Spartans need to continue taking more steps in the right direction. \n\"We need to continue to work to improve, stay healthy and remain focused on the opportunity to achieve goals, no matter who the opponent is,\" Bellinger said. \nIt is reflective of the team's overall mentality. A goal-oriented approach to 2015 is allowing Paramus to push all the right buttons. \n\"The success and tradition of the program is always an edge in setting a standard that the team is not willing to let go,\" Bellinger said. \"They understand what they represent beyond themselves and are invested in upholding the tradition.\" \nNow, as the team's past successes and current accomplishments come together, the former having laid the foundation for the latter, Paramus can ignore the outside noise and just keep winning.
