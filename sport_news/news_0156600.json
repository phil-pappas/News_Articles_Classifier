The pros already know and understand how to use MENAJI, but the male consumer should also know how easy these products are to use,” said MENAJI President Pamela Viglielmo.\nMENAJI Training began at a Los Angeles beauty store Frends Beauty Supply, founded in 1940 by the original owner Sig Frends, and one of the world's largest professional beauty establishments open to the public, supplying the majority of the large-budget films and TV shows. The store features more 20,000 different professional beauty supply products within its 15,000 square feet of space.\nFrends staff said that their professional clients who use only the very best products said that MENAJI is ideal for their male clients because there is no down time, doesn’t cause redness, is undetectable and can even be taken on location.\nViglielmo says that the company knows that looking young and healthy to most guys means a bar of soap and tanning, with the occasional anti-aging cream. But if they were a little better educated, said Viglielmo, they might also try a safer sunless tan, which might be a better solution than harmful UV rays.\n“Men who dress well and work out, want to present themselves at their best to the world,” said Viglielmo. “They are taking the step to include skincare that delivers immediate results in their routines. To provide better outcomes for them, we initiated a training at Frends for their staff on the ease of application and instant benefits of MENAJI.”\nFrends Beauty Director of Marketing Matt Morelli said, \"We're excited to begin working with the MENAJI brand and the team behind it. Men's grooming isn't a new concept, but it is one that we think needs more attention because - guys, a bar of soap doesn't always cut it. I'm a man's man and I admit, I tried it and it is amazing. With so many brands at Frends Beauty specifically formulated for women, we're happy to offer a line that caters to the needs of men as well.\"\nAbout MENAJI\nMënaji Advanced Men’s Skincare, is an iconic, unique brand of men’s skincare that is the original a category creator for Hi-Def, undetectable, camera-ready men’s cosmetics.
