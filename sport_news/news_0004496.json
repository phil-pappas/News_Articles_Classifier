(Mark Almond) Comments \nUAB men's golfer Lee Hodges has been named the Conference USA Men's Golfer of the Week following his individual win at the Shoal Creek Invitational, the league office announced Wednesday. \n\"I'm really proud of Lee Hodges who gets his first collegiate win,\" Murray said following the tournament. \"He beat out Will (Cannon) and Taylor Eyster . Lee's knocked on the door for a while now and I know he's been really anxious about getting that first win. It's a great reward for him.\" \nThe sophomore, who had previously recorded four top-5 finishes in his career (third three times, second once), broke through to capture individual medalist honors in the 66-player field. \nAfter an even-par first round, Hodges carded four birdies en route to a 4-under, 68, in Monday's second round. His third round was highlighted by three birdies, including one at the par-3 eighth when his tee shot dropped within inches of the pin. \nThe award for Hodges marks the second of his career (other came on Sept. 24, 2014) and the first this season. \nHodges and the Blazers were the only team to finish under par at 13-under, 851 for the tournament. The Green and Gold put together a tournament-record 12-under, 276 in the final 18 holes, defeating defending champion North Florida by 15 strokes. \nUAB returns to the course next week at the Jerry Pate National Intercollegiate, Oct. 5-6 in Birmingham.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T21:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:04:20.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
