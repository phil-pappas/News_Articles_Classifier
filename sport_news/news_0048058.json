He does a lot for the team.\" \nSwansea have now gone four games without a league win but manager Garry Monk felt it was a much improved performance from last weekend's 3-1 defeat at Southampton. \n\"We were much more like ourselves,\" Monk said. \n\"We talked all week about getting back to our level, and you could see the passion and the desire we had to win the game was massive. \n\"We have performed fantastically in many games already this season, but we've had a couple where we were well below our standards. \n\"According to some people, a three-game run is a blip, but I know my players have quality. \n\"It's just a question of getting that out of them on a consistent basis. We saw it here and hopefully now we can go from strength to strength.\" \nTold about Pochettino's view that Spurs had dropped two points, Monk replied: \"They were never in the lead, so I don't know how. \n\"Without the two free-kicks, I think we would have won the game and we certainly didn't deserve to lose it. \n\"It took an incredible save (from Hugo Lloris) at the end to deny Fede (Fernandez) a winner, and I thought overall we performed very well.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:48:54.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
