Nichole Cox from Glen Lake won it all in Division 4 last year with a strong performance on the final day. As a sophomore, Cox bested Farwell's Bria Colosky by a single stroke to win the title. Early success did not surprise her coach. \n\"Really, right away as a freshman, the first day we're on the first tee and she's take a swing at a drive and it's just powerful,\" Glen Lake golf coach Paul Christiansen said. \"There's just the woosh of the driver, and one gal just went, 'wow.' Well, it's kind of been that way ever since.\" \nAs a junior this season, Cox has finished with the best score in six of her eight events this season. She's also averaged a score of 74 during the process. \n\"I had a friend tell me that junior year was the year that you really dropped a lot of strokes,\" Cox said. \"I've done so well over the summer and I think I've matured, so it's nice. I've played really well this year.\" \nThe Division 4 finals tee of Friday and conclude Saturday at the Forest Akers East golf course on the campus of Michigan State University.
