But Stroman insists it’s true.\nNot many bombshells are dropped by players or coaches during playoff series — the old “don’t give the opposition any ammunition” school of thought — but Stroman dropped a small one on Thursday prior to Game 1 of the ALDS.\nThe son of a New York City detective who, if he’s not smiling, must be asleep, said that when he’s pitching, he’s motivated by the dark arts — negativity of all things, which actually prompted a couple of media types to laugh during his pre-game availability on Thursday.\nStroman made the comments when asked if he was worried about not being able to reel in his emotions on the mound for Game 2, given his age and inexperience. Friday’s game will be his first ever MLB start in the post-season.\n“No, I think I’m going to be all right, I think I’ll be good,” said Stroman, who spent Wednesday night at the Maple Leafs’ opener smiling and waving at the Air Canada Centre faithful. “I feel like I do a good job of being able to bottle it up and use it kind of when I need to. Like you said, I’m a very emotional kind of pitcher. I wear my heart on my sleeve, that’s how I’ve always been. I pitch with a lot of hate and anger and emotion in my heart, it’s just something that I’ve always kind of built myself on, and I’m just excited. I can’t wait to get out there. I wish I could put it in words.”\n“Hate?” someone asked Stroman.\n“Hate, yeah, a lot of anger, a lot goes into it,” he said. “I’m 5-foot-8, a lot of people doubt me, so that’s with me every single pitch on the mound.”\nStroman was a standout for Patchogue-Medford High School on Long Island and then excelled at Duke University before being drafted by the Blue Jays 22nd overall in the 2012 draft.\nDespite his success and incredible stuff, there were always questions about Stroman because of his diminutive stature. All his life, he’s had to fight that stigma and still uses it for motivation — although he’s certainly the nicest, most pleasant Angry Young Man in sports today.\nStroman said the anger and hate on the mound go all the way back to his days playing high-school ball in New York.\n“Yeah, absolutely,” he said. “I kind of found that it shows off the confidence that I have in myself and ... something that my father kind of raised me on. He knew I wasn’t going to be the biggest guy in the room, so he told me to play with a chip on my shoulder — kind of don’t worry about what others say.\n“So I pitch with a lot of emotion in my heart and I feel like that’s something that I need for me to be me. I do a good job of being able to bottle it up where it’s not too much, but it’s not too little.\n“(Mark) Buehrle is always trying to get me to do less, but I’m always trying to tell him I need more to get me going. I’m just excited, man, and this is an unbelievable opportunity, especially where I came from this past year. I’m just ecstatic just to be here. Not just to be here, but I’m ready to go out there and compete and dominate.”\nDespite the inner anger he uses as motivation, Stroman has made a ton of fans in Toronto, Canada and across the league, for his talent and his personality — and his improbable comeback this season after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in spring training and undergoing surgery.\nIt was expected that he’d miss the entire 2015 season. But not only did he make it back — just in time to replace a fading Buehrle — he managed to finish his degree at Duke at the same time. Since returning on Sept.12, Stroman has gone 4-0, posting a 1.67 ERA and 0.96 WHIP in 27 innings.\nOne of his biggest fans is the man against whom he’ll be squaring off on Friday, Rangers ace Cole Hamels.\n“You have to give Stroman some serious credit for what he’s done this year. I was in Clearwater just down the street from when he injured his knee and from what he’s been able to do, it’s absolutely tremendous,” said Hamels.\n“I think it shows his true character, just for the fact of being able to go to school and playing the game of baseball. That’s something that I don’t think I could have done, so he’s definitely got something pretty special within him.”\nHamels, a late-season acquisition like David Price of the Blue Jays, has been just as valuable to the Rangers since touching down in the Lone Star State. He has gone 7-1 for Texas with a 3.66 ERA in 12 starts since being traded to Texas on July 31 in a multi-player swap.\nFriday’s match will feature an experienced lefty in Hamels versus a greenhorn righty in Stroman. In 13 post-season games with the Phillies, Hamels has posted a 7-4 record with a 3.09 ERA and is looking forward to a raucous crowd at the Rogers Centre.\n“This is a tremendous city and stadium,” Hamels said. “This is the reason we play baseball. No matter what team we play for, we want to be able to play in front of a high-octane crowd and this is what Toronto offers.\n“I enjoy the moments that I get to go out there and throw a baseball, but you get to play in front of huge crowds that are watching every move that you make, either in appreciation or for the other end, of disdain. So this is what it’s all about.”\nEmail: steve.buffery@sunmedia.ca\nTwitter: @beezersun\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nBLUE JAYS\nStroman to pitch Game 2 'with a lot of hate and anger'\nBy Steve Buffery , Toronto Sun First posted: Thursday, October 08, 2015 05:36 PM EDT | Updated: Thursday, October 08, 2015 06:54 PM EDT\nWhen you watch Marcus Stroman on the mound at the Rogers Centre on Friday afternoon, smiling and smacking his gum like an excited cub scout, remember, he’s full of anger and hate.\nHard to believe, we know.
