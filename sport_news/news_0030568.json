It is currently a wait and see if those workers will like it enough to approve it.\nUnion members were trickling in and out of the UAW Local 12 Union Hall for a morning meeting Wednesday. The UAW has released some details already about but Wednesday members hoped to get clarity and even make up their minds.\nThis is the second deal the UAW has received from fiat Chrysler. The first one was voted down by about 60 percent of the members nationwide. That led to the potential of a strike, which was avoided by this last minute.\nThis current deal moves to close the wage gap between newer and more experienced workers. It also has a signing bonus, promises to invest billions in its plant and a moratorium on outsourcing. But for each member, the concerns and the issues vary.\nActual voting begins October 20th.", "external_links": ["http://media.graytvinc.com/images/local12.jpg", "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/4D9/BAB/4D9BAB5F249C43E48A4B128D68D210F0.mp4", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x480&iu=/301721715/WTVG&ciu_szs&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&ad_rule=1&vpos=preroll&env=vp&output=xml_vast2&unviewed_position_start=1&correlator=", "http://up.anv.bz/latest/scripts/anvload.js", "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/353*198/local12.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:08:17.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
