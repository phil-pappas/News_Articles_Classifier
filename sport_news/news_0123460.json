After goalless opening two quarters, Nick Ross broke the deadlock for New Zealand in the 41st minute. But the hosts’ joy was short-lived as India equalised two minutes later through a field goal from SV Sunil (43rd). The first quarter of the game witnessed a series of attacks from India, who dominated the entire session. Skipper Sardar Singh broke through the hosts’ defence from the right flank but his attack was foiled by Alex Shaw. In the 11th minute, India were awarded a penalty corner but Rupinder Pal Singh’s effort missed the target. New Zealand then put some pressure on the Indian defence with a long pass from Blair Tarrant, who found Nic Woods in a goal-scoring position but his effort was denied by an alert Indian defence. The dying moments of the first quarter saw Akashdeep Singh get a chance to open the account but his attempt went wide of the post. In the second quarter, the Black Sticks dominated the early part with an attack from the left side, which earned them a penalty corner, but goalkeeper PR Sreejesh made a good save. This was followed by a counter-attack from India but an unmarked Dharamvir Singh’s attempt was blocked by the New Zealand goalkeeper. Akashdeep then pierced through the defence but his attempt was thwarted as both the teams failed to open their account by the half-time break. After the change of ends, both the teams tried hard to break the deadlock but could not find a way through. Finally, in the 41st minute, the game witnessed its first goal from the stick of Ross, who collected a pass from Steve Edwards and finished off the move to give the hosts a 1-0 lead. Two minutes later, India drew level through Sunil. The last quarter saw some desperate moves from both the sides but without any success. — PTI Johor Cup: India colts have great start, beat Pak 5-1 Johor Bahru: Defending champions India began their campaign in style by thrashing arch-rivals Pakistan 5-1 in the fifth Sultan of Johor Cup junior hockey tournament.
