(Photo: Clarence Tabb Jr., Detroit News) \nAuburn Hills â€“ Point guard Reggie Jackson did a splendid job of leading the Pistons Wednesday night. He finished with 10 points and 11 assists during a 99-94 preseason loss to the Charlotte Hornets at The Palace. \nHowever, he could not hit the broadside of a barn, finishing 3-for-15 from the field. \nHe battled a Hornets team (7-0) that is playing as if the regular season has already begun. The Pistons are 2-5. \nJackson must put his best foot forward every time he hits the floor. But he must improve his outside shooting or defenses can cheat and take away the inside from him. \nJackson had an exasperated look after finally hitting a long jumper in the fourth quarter. He missed all eight of his 3-point attempts. However, he found teammates off the pick-and-roll when he penetrated the lane against the Hornets. \nBad shooting cost the Pistons overall. Jackson missed a 3-point attempt with 1:56 remaining with the Pistons up one, and he got trapped inside the lane and missed another errant shot. The Hornets responded with five straight points to go up 96-92. \nThe Pistons trailed 97-94 with 12 seconds remaining but Jackson missed another step-away 3-pointer, sealing the win for Charlotte. \nPistons rookie Stanley Johnson didn't reach his goal of starting for the Pistons just yet. \nCoach Stan Van Gundy is going with veterans Marcus Morris and Ersan Ilyasova at the forward spots when the season begins Tuesday night in Atlanta against the Hawks. \nHowever, Johnson can be a spark off the bench. He showed some early flashes through defense. Sometimes it is tough selling a rookie on defense, but Johnson earned accolades from that end of the floor Wednesday. \nSo did Andre Drummond, who got in early foul trouble but stayed with 6-foot-11 center Al Jefferson, who often makes things difficult for the Pistons. On this night he shot 5-of-15 and finished with 17 points and six rebounds. \nJohnson made a couple first-half steals that led to fast-break opportunities for Johnson and his teammates. He capped a couple with dunks and was fouled while driving to the hoop a third time. He is still trying to find his shooting touch, but Johnson has attacked the rim with gusto. \nHowever, he wasn't nearly as good in the half-court game and finished with six points and was 2-for-7 from the field. \nEventually the time for Johnson to start will come. But right now Van Gundy is sticking with his surefire threesome of center Drummond (21 points, 15 rebounds), Jackson (10 points, 11 assists) and shooting guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. \nCaldwell-Pope twisted his left foot in the first quarter and was taken into the training room; X-rays were negative. He returned to the bench late in the third quarter but did not play. It is not known if he will play in Friday's final preseason game at The Palace, against Atlanta, but he is expected back for the season opener. \nThe Pistons need his scoring punch. KCP spent the first two years of his career trying to find himself. However, he has been one of the Pistons' best players and finished with eight points in just 10 minutes. \nThe Hornets placed four players in double figures, led by Nicolas Batum (18 points and 10 rebounds), Jeremy Lin (18 points, five assists), Jefferson (17 points, six rebounds) and Troy Daniels (15 points).
