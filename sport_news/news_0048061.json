This isn’t your average triathlon. It includes basketball shooting, golf and bowling. The cost is $75 per person with two, three or four-person teams competing. The fee includes the basketball shooting competition, lunch before golf, 18 holes of golf with cart, a pizza dinner at the bowling alley and three games of bowling including shoes. The winning team of each event gets as many points as number of teams. For instance, with 10 teams, the winning team in golf (lowest scratch core) receives 10 points. Second place receives nine, third eight and so on. The sames goes for basketball and bowling. In the case of a tie, the points are divided equally. If two teams tie for second, nine and eight points are added together and divided by two. The team with the highest total points for all three events wins. Basketball is at Clinton High School with check-in at 10:30 a.m. and competition at 10:45 (15 free throws and 3-pointers per player). Golf is at 1 p.m. at the Ledges (7111 McCurry Road, Roscoe). Bowling is at Cougar Lanes in Clinton.
