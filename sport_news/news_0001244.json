The major highlight of the fair was the launch of women entrepreneur portal ‘Himani’, a Department of MSME, Government of Uttarakhand, initiative. While inaugurating the event, Chief Minister Harish Rawat said the CII fair helped local businesses and trades explore new opportunities. Talking about ‘Himani’, he said the portal would provide all information regarding schemes and policies of state departments to women entrepreneurs. It would provide information on various marketing platforms and upcoming promotional activities, including fairs, exhibitions, buyer-seller meets etc. The best feature of this e-platform is that “It enables the women entrepreneurs of Uttarakhand, including the women SHGs and NGOs to display and market their products online and sell them nationally,” Rawat stated. Labour and Small Industry Minister Harish Chandra Durgapal said “The state Department of MSME is working hard towards empowering women entrepreneurs.
