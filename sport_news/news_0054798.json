This is what I’m doing. I love the Ravens, I love being here. It’s not a consideration.” \nThe Ravens’ 1-4 start is their worst under Harbaugh, but the Super Bowl-winning coach has little reason to leave, it seems. He has a 73-44 regular season record and has six playoff appearances in seven seasons with the Ravens. \nHarbaugh last coached in college at the University of Indiana in 1997. \n——— \nVisit The Baltimore Sun at www.baltimoresun.com \nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.
