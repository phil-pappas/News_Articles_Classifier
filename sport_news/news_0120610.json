I think he's (Nadal) going to answer better. But from what I've seen, he's saying it's not necessary,\" the Serb said at Wimbledon.\n\"He has won 14 Grand Slam titles. He's one of the best players in the game with his uncle Toni who has been with him for his entire career.\"\nNadal himself insists he can get back to the top, and is using the end-of-year swing starting in Beijing as \"practice\" for next season.\n\"I think I am working well. I am very motivated to go for that challenge that brings me the chance to overcome a tough situation for me,\" he said on Sunday.\n\"I love that feeling, and I am going to fight to make that happen.\"\nToni Nadal was speaking while promoting the Rafa Nadal Academy, which will open in his home town of Manacor in Mallorca next May.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-05T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:18:02.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
