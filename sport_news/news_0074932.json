(WKYT) – Former Wildcat Nazr Mohammed’s NBA career appears to be over. \nMohammed was in Lexington on Saturday, helping with instruction at the inaugural Jr. NBA Clinic. \nAfter 17 NBA seasons, Mohammed talks like he’s ready for retirement. \n“Right now I’m just relaxing, hanging with the family,” Mohammed said. “I’m staying in shape, just in case I change my mind. As of this moment, I’m not thinking about playing.” \nMohammed spent the past three seasons in Chicago. He was a first-round pick by Utah back in 1998. \n“I've been fortunate to play so long, and I've been fortunate to be with some great organizations,” Mohammed said. \nMore than 150 kids attended the Jr. NBA Clinic, which is affiliated with the National Police Athletic League. \n“As I get older, having kids, I know it's important to give back. So whenever you can, whenever you have the time, if you can give back and kind of pay forward what's been given to you.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:04:23.793+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
