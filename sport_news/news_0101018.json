Shea-USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nHOUSTON -- Governor Greg Abbott may have drawn a balk for his false start on a tweet about the Houston Astros Monday afternoon. \nGovernor Abbott, or someone in his office, tweeted congratulations to the Houston Astros when the team had a 6-2 lead heading into the eighth inning. It may have seemed logical considering Houston was just six outs away from a trip to the American League Championship Series. \nTweeet sent by Greg Abbott Congratulating Astros on victory. (Photo: Twitter) \nThere was just that little thing of closing out the final two innings of the game. Houston took the lead into the eighth inning and proceeded to blow the lead en route to a 9-6 loss to the Royals. \nThis is where the term oops might come in handy. \nAfter the Royals rallied in the eighth, the tweet, which came from the account @GovAbbott , was quickly deleted. The @GovAbott handle is for \"official news form the Office of Texas Governor Greg Abbott and is verified by Twitter.
