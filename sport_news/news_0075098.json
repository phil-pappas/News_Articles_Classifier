(AP) - Marshawn Lynch will miss a second straight week for the Seattle Seahawks due to a hamstring strain. \nThe team on Friday officially ruled Lynch out for Sunday's game against the Cincinnati Bengals. \nLynch injured his hamstring in the second quarter of the team's 26-0 victory over the Chicago Bears in Week 3. Lynch returned to limited participation in practice on Thursday but is not ready to return. He will not travel with the team to Cincinnati. \nBackup Fred Jackson is listed as questionable after suffering a high-ankle sprain last week against Detroit. Seahawks coach Pete Carroll was optimistic that Jackson would be able to play. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
