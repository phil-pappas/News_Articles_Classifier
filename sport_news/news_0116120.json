The Buckeyes (8-0) have been No. 1 all season, but had been losing first-place votes in recent weeks. This week, Ohio State had 39 first-place votes in the poll released Sunday after routing Rutgers. Baylor, Clemson, LSU and TCU - the rest of the top 5 - also received first-place votes, as did No. 7 Alabama. Utah had its highest regular-season ranking after climbing to No. 3 last week, but dropped 10 spots after losing to unranked Southern California. Florida State also dropped after its first loss of the season, falling eight places to No. 17. The Seminoles lost 22-16 to Georgia Tech on a blocked field goal that was returned for a touchdown on the game's final play. ___ AP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org (Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
