Roy M. King, LSU’s athletic band director, confirmed the news on Wednesday. \nSouth Carolina was forced to move the game from Columbia, S.C., to Baton Rouge, La. because of the devastating flooding that took place in Columbia and across the state this week. The South Carolina pep band announced it will be unable to travel to Louisiana for the game. UPDATE: Unfortunately, due to time and travel challenges involved, a pep band will not go to LSU. — USC Bands (@TheCarolinaBand) October 7, 2015 \nLSU coach Les Miles offered his support to the university and the state on Wednesday. \n“We want to support South Carolina in anything they want to do,” Miles said during the SEC teleconference. “We have been through weather issues here.” \nMiles was forced to travel to Tempe, Ariz., 10 years ago for a game against Arizona State after Hurricane Katrina demolished much of Louisiana. The No. 5 Tigers won that game, 35-31, thanks to a touchdown in the waning minutes.
