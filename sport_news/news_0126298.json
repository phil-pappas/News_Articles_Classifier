A 'Back to the Future' cart PGA 1 day ago Mark Aumann Â© Provided by PGA Oct. 21, 2015 is \"Back to the Future Day\" -- the day Doc Brown and Marty McFly visited the Hill Valley of the future in the movie trilogy. So on this date, why not feature a golf cart designed like the famous DeLorean used as the time machine in the films?\nA Canadian custom car designer, David Heykants of Reed Deer, Alberta, took on the project through his Dual Divisions company.\nAdChoices According to his website , the project took \"patience, late nights, caffeine, patience, and sweat.\"\nYou've got to love something that takes twice the amount of patience than normal.\nThe project was commissed by Red Deer College. And it took a lot of fabrication, according to Heykants.\n\"The Mr. Fusion is entirely made of metal,\" Heykants wrote on his website. \"It also hides a cooler inside. The front end? All metal. The side panels with all the electronic items? Metal. Yes, this cart is built to last.\"\nJust don't try to drive it at 88 mph.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://dualdivisions.weebly.com/delorean-golf-cart.html"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:45:59.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
