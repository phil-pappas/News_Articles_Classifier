Most recently, police say officers were told by witnesses that Jones ran from a crash that hospitalized a pregnant motorist and then returned to his rental car to grab a wad of cash. \nJones pleaded guilty last month to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident involving injury. He will serve up to 18 months of supervised probation. Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:14:54.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
