(Image Source: Leon Halip/Getty Images) \nBig Ten East division power rankings following Week 6: \n(1) Ohio State Buckeyes (2); Record: 6-0 (2-0) \nLast Week: Won vs. Maryland 49-28 \nAre they playing like the best team in the country, conference or division? No, but the Buckeyes have the most talent in the B1G, hands down. What we liked on Saturday? WR Braxton Miller was a factor with five catches for 79 yards and a TD and QB J.T. Barrett was efficient (12 carries, 62 yards; 2 of 26 passing, 26 yards) and very effective in the red zone (3 TDs). But I didn’t like 28 points allowed to a Maryland team that combined for six points against West Virginia and Michigan. \nComing Up: 10/17: vs. Penn State; 10/24: @ Rutgers \n(2) Michigan Wolverines (3); Record: 5-1 (2-0) \nLast Week: Won vs. Northwestern 38-0 \nIt was the defensive battle everyone expected…at least when Northwestern had the ball as the Wolverines did not allowed a point for the third game in a row. The last time any FBS team had three-straight shutouts was 1995, the last time a Big Ten team did it was 1980. WR Jehu Chesson got the party started with an opening kickoff TD and QB Jake Rudock was a proficient 17 of 23 (season-high 73.9 %). \nComing Up: 10/17: vs. Michigan State; 10/24: @ Minnesota \n(3) Michigan State Spartans; Record (1): 6-0 (2-0) \nLast Week: Won @ Rutgers 31-24 \nThe Spartans have simply tested fate one too many times for my liking. The offense isn’t as explosive as we hoped and the defense isn’t as dominant as it once was. Right now they’re not even the best team in their own state, never mind the B1G East. MSU doesn’t have that edge anymore…maybe taking on the underdog role against Michigan will help them rediscover it. \nComing Up: 10/17: @ Michigan; 10/14: vs. Indiana \n(4) Penn State Nittany Lions (4); Record: 5-1 (2-0) \nLast Week: Won vs. Indiana 29-7 \nThe passing game still isn’t very crisp, completing 53.8 percent of your passes isn’t impressive, but they are getting more efficient. QB Christian Hackenberg threw two TDs, ran for two TD, and now has six scoring strikes with no INTs in his past three games. Former walk-on, DE Carl Nassib , had another monster game with two sacks and two forced fumbles. They’re clearly behind the top three and clearly ahead of the bottom three in the B1GE. \nComing Up: 10/17: @ Ohio State; 10/24: vs. Maryland \n(5) Rutgers Scarlet Knights (6); Record: 2-3 (0-2) \nLast Week: Lost vs. Michigan State 31-24 \nYou don’t think WR Leonte Carroo is a difference maker? In his return the senior caught seven passes for 134 yards, including all three of RU’s touchdowns against the Spartans. They were expected to have a strong running game and his presence makes them a much more balanced offense. \nComing Up: 10/17: @ Indiana; 10/24: vs. Ohio State \n(6) Indiana Hoosiers (5); Record: 4-2 (0-2) \nLast Week: Lost vs. Penn State 29-7 \nThe Hoosiers lose a second-straight game and continue to lose quarterbacks as Zander Diamont was knocked out by Penn State and third-stringer Danny Cameron (6 of 16, INT) struggled off the bench. Sound familiar? Whether it’s a reason or an excuse the inability to stay healthy at the QB position may once again derail what once looked like a promising season (we’re talking 6 or 7 wins) in Bloomington. If they can’t turn things around this week, expect the losing streak to reach six games, at least. \nComing Up: 10/17: vs. Rutgers; 10/24: @ Michigan State \n(7) Maryland Terrapins (7); Record: 2-4 (0-2) \nLast Week: Lost @ Ohio State 49-28 \nAs it’s painfully obvious that the Terps are the worst team in the division, maybe the conference, it’s not the biggest surprise that HC Randy Edsall would be fired, although maybe not in-season. It was their fourth loss of the year by at least 21 points, including their third straight. I’m not saying Edsall didn’t deserve to be canned, but their QB issues will remain. Sure, Perry Hills ran for 170 yards and two TDs against OSU but was 10 of 27 passing (37 percent) with two INTs (1 TD). \nComing Up: 10/17: Idle; 10/24: vs. Penn State \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
