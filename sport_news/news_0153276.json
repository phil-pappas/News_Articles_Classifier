The team led the majors in runs in 2014, but slipped to 12th in the league this season.\nA former MVP with the Angels, Baylor has spent 23 years as a major league manager or hitting coach.\nHis season got off to a dubious start in 2014, when he fractured his leg when he slipped during a pregame ceremony. Baylor has been back on the job full time since the middle of the 2014 season, but he was still noticeably hobbled this season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:41:27.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
