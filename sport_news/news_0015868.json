But Napoli was also full of confidence after a 4-0 victory at AC Milan last time out. \nFiorentina started brightly and went close to taking the lead in the 17th minute but Pepe Reina did well to deny Jakub Blaszczykowski with a one-handed diving save. \nNapoli could have gone in front on the stroke of halftime as Higuain's header from Insigne's cross flew just wide of the right-hand post. \nIt did take the lead just 43 seconds after the break, when Insigne burst past Nenad Tomovic down the left and ran onto Marek Hamsik's deep ball before cutting in to fire a low shot into the bottom right corner. \nKalinic leveled with a similar goal, outsprinting the Napoli defenders and running onto a brilliant Josip Ilicic ball over the top, to score his fifth goal in eight Serie A matches. \nBut Napoli was immediately back in front when Higuain beat Ilicic to the ball, played a swift one-two with Dries Mertens and fired past Fiorentina goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu. \nDomenico Berardi returned from injury for Sassuolo and had an immediate impact as he gave his side a seventh-minute lead from the penalty spot after Senad Lulic was harshly adjudged to have brought down Paolo Cannavaro. \nLazio almost leveled immediately but Sergej Milinkovic-Savic headed Antonio Candreva's cross off the crossbar. \nSassuolo doubled its advantage on the hour. Nicola Sansone scuffed a Sime Vrsaljko cross, but Simone Missiroli ran in behind to finish it off. \nThe home side almost sealed the result moments later but Diego Falcinelli's effort crashed off the crossbar. \nIt was almost made to rue that missed opportunity as Lazio reduced the deficit in the 67th when Keita Balde Diao slotted the ball across to Felipe Anderson who placed it into the bottom left corner. \nAny hope Lazio had of snatching something from the match evaporated when Danilo Cataldi was sent off for a second booking in stoppage time. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:26:08.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
