It’s unprecedented and unusual, and few, if any, Jaguars player even knew about the strange setup. \n“Wait, this game isn’t on TV?” safety Josh Evans said. “I didn’t even know that. People have to watch it online?” \nThe game will be televised in the Jacksonville and Buffalo areas. But outside those markets, it can be found online (https:nflstream.yahoo.com) or through a number of digital media players: Amazon Fire TV, AppleTV, ChromeCast, Roku, Samsung, TiVo, Vizio P-Series, XBOX 360 and XBOX One. \n“We’re flying nine hours for a game that’s on the Internet?” Jaguars defensive end Jared Odrick said, drawing laughs from teammates sitting near his locker. \nMaybe that comes with being Buffalo and Jacksonville. \nThe Bills (3-3) have the missed the playoffs for 15 consecutive seasons - the NFL’s longest active playoff drought. The Jaguars (1-5) have six losing records in the last seven years and are a league-worst 10-44 over the last four seasons. \nSo they ended up being part of the NFL’s streaming experiment. \n“I can make it sound good and say it means a lot,” Bills coach Rex Ryan said. “It is just a game for us. We don’t know who is shooting it, seeing it, whatever you say. That is cool we are the first one.” \nBoth teams enter the game with key injuries and trying to fix defensive woes. \nThe Bills will be without quarterback Tyrod Taylor (sprained left knee) for a second straight game. Veteran defensive Kyle Williams, receiver Sammie Watkins, receiver Percy Harvin, running back Karlos Williams and offensive tackle Seantrel Henderson also have been ruled out. Running back LeSean McCoy is playing with a nagging hamstring injury. \nBuffalo also had a number of defensive linemen speak out in frustration about dropping into coverage instead of rushing quarterbacks. \nThe Jaguars are starting to get healthy after playing several games without tight end Julius Thomas, defensive end Andre Branch and defensive tackle Sen’Derrick Marks. The more pressing problem has been mounting consistent pressure on opposing quarterbacks. \nCoach Gus Bradley vowed to blitz Bills backup quarterback EJ Manuel early and often. \n“We have to look at whether what we gain outweighs what we could give up,” Bradley said. “Right now, we have one interception in six games. To bring pressure with the idea of affecting the quarterback to get more turnovers, I think that’s the stage we’re at right now.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:58:55.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
