The Argos are in no hurry to look beyond the remaining five games of the regular season and whatever run the team makes in the playoffs. But each time Harris is able to elevate his game to another level, the name Ricky Ray gets pushed further into the background. \nIt’s been the strangest of seasons for the Argos. No one was sure when Ray would return following off-season shoulder surgery and nobody was quite certain as to the kind of presence Harris would have on the offence as its new incumbent. \nBut Harris’ ability to make plays with his feet was quite obvious on Tuesday night, most noticeably when he was forced up in the pocket, then to run to his left. As he made his way to the sideline, Harris neatly transferred the football from his right hand (his throwing hand) to the left in a fundamentally sound progression that makes it virtually impossible for the opposing defence to strip it and recover it. \nHis arm, meanwhile, was in vintage form as well tossing touchdowns to five different receivers. \nThe Argos won despite losing the turnover battle and committing 20 penalties, unthinkable on a night when the game officials were wretched for both sides. \nWith Harris having cemented his status as the Argos’ starting QB, if Ray does play a down this season, it’ll have to be in relief. However, until Harris lines up in a playoff game — which now seems highly likely barring a bizarre turn of events — the jury will be out on Toronto’s fourth-year quarterback. \nNo team turns its back on a three-time Grey Cup champion quarterback — a future hall of famer no less — but it’s now difficult to see how Ray fits into the Argos’ future plans. Both he and Harris are free agents after this season and the latter’s stock is at its highest, similar to the circumstances when Zach Collaros took over from an injured Ray in 2013 before bolting to Hamilton in free agency. \nMoney doesn’t appear to be an obstacle for the Argos, who figure to have substantial cap room this off-season with the potential of several high-priced and high-profile veterans expected to hit free agency. \nAnd many of the team’s first-year players, who are making pocket change, may be locked up with new deals. \nThen again, the Argos have been quite generous in releasing players seeking another shot in the NFL. \nHarris took his shot at the NFL and he’s now taking full advantage of his position. \nA lot can happen down the CFL’s stretch drive, but Harris has joined Henry Burris in the conversation for MOP in the East and arguably in the league. In three games against the RedBlacks, the Argos won each time with Harris making game-winning plays. Players are often judged against each other and having a 3-0 record against Burris provides Harris with an edge. \nOn Tuesday night, Toronto’s Big Three receiving corps — Kevin Elliott, Tori Gurley and Vidal Hazelton — accounted for 10 receptions and three touchdowns, while the Little Three of Chad Owens, Anthony Coombs and Brandon Whitaker, who returns to Montreal for the first time on Monday, accounted for 21 receptions and 209 yards. \nOn the night, Harris completed 32 of 44 passes for 397 yards and two interceptions. \nThe Argos got a glimpse of Harris in last year’s season finale when he made his first-career start and led the team to a win over Ottawa. \nIn this year’s season opener, he was nearly flawless in helping lead the Argos to a win over Edmonton. \nWhen Harris led the Argos to a late-game touchdown drive in Regina, he came of age. And now he has added to his resume with the performance in Ottawa, an Argos win that has turned the East into a three-way tie with Hamilton holding the tiebreaker over Toronto. \n“It was a great drive,\" said head Scott Milanovich of the 10-play, 74-yard sequence that was punctuated by Owens’ diving one-handed catch in the end zone. “It couldn’t get any better. But the turnovers, that’s where (Harris) needs to clean up, the three or four throws, or the decisions that hurt us. We put a lot of pressure on him and I expect a ton from him. He’s a first-year starter and I’ve got to keep reminding myself of that. He’s doing a great job and I want to keep pushing him to be perfect.” \nThere’s an obvious loyalty factor Milanovich must have for Ray, whose presence lifted the Argos to their Grey Cup run in 2012. \nRay appears to be getting closer, but each time Harris makes winning plays, there’s no reason to think he can’t be the new face of Toronto’s franchise. \nVan Zeyl injured, status unknown \nOne of the more sobering items to emerge from Tuesday’s titillating triumph in Ottawa was the health status of Chris Van Zeyl, Toronto’s tough as nails offensive tackle who injured his calf. \nVan Zeyl has overcome a lot of physical discomfort the past few seasons and it’s unknown if he’ll be able to line up Thanksgiving Monday in Montreal against the well-rested Als, whose season has turned desperate. \nThe Argos, who returned home Wednesday following their 38-35 win over the RedBlacks, have a short week to prepare for Montreal. \nDuring the week of preparation for Ottawa, Van Zeyl was limited. \nIn Ottawa, Matt Sewell lined up at right tackle and the Boatmen went all-in with Americans on offence, dressing five receivers and two running backs. \nJarriel King, an American who has started at both tackle slots and at guard, was injured last week during practice. \nIf Van Zeyl can’t go against the Als, it’s a big loss for the Argos, who still can’t establish a run game and were limited to 48 yards on Tuesday night.
