Akshay Ramesh | New Delhi, October 13, 2015 | UPDATED 22:37 IST Mail A+ A- Dhoni, who is struggling to get going from ball one, has to make the bold decision of giving himself more time in the middle, even if it is going to disrupt the team's rhythm. (AP Photo) \nIndia and South Africa have met each other three times in the ongoing tour and the home team has not been able to record a single win. Not many would have expected such a dismal performance from the Men in Blue, especially after the visitors' loss against a second-string India A team in their warm-up game. \nThe hosts, though, will be looking for their first win of the tour when they take on the formidable Proteas at the Holkar Cricket Stadium in Indore on Wednesday. And there can not a better venue for India to break the jinx in the series as the home team have had a cent percent record at the stadium. \nBut, going up against an in-form South Africa squad, history seems immaterial to the struggling Indian unit. The players have failed to click as a unit. Except Rohit Sharma and off spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, none have made worthy contributions to the team. \nWith Ashwin's injury adding to Dhoni's woes, key players including the skipper himself have to improve their game to stay alive in the series. \nDhoni should lead from the front \nDhoni's lack of form has affected the team the most. His inability to score quick runs in the end overs has been a big concern. Be it the two T20 games or the first ODI, Dhoni has let the side down. With him struggling to middle the ball, the lack of match practise after a three-month break is evident. Dhoni has been saying that he wants to bat higher up the order. But he has not really made the move in the previous encounters. Dhoni, who is struggling to get going from ball one, has to make the bold decision of giving himself more time in the middle, even if it is going to disrupt the team's rhythm. If the skipper is able to contribute to the team's cause with the bat, India will be well placed to seal the game. Dhoni should refrain himself from thinking his brains out and must pad up earlier than usual. \nKohli not amongst runs \nKohli's career average reads a staggering 50.35. He has gone on and scored a ton on 22 off the 162 occasions he has represented the country. But in the last one year, lack of consistency has been troubling him and the team. Failure with the bat in Kanpur meant Kohli's streak of 10 matches without a half-century extended. Kohli's lack of form in the shorter formats of the game has taken many by surprise, for he has been among the runs in Tests. Quite a number of senior cricketers have backed the out-of-form batsman. It would be difficult for him to get back to touch when he is unsure of his batting position. But Kohli would want to bounce back and the team would be well served if he makes the scorers work hard on Wednesday. \nBhuvi's Blues \nBaring the 2015 Cricket World Cup, India have struggled to pick up early wickets with the new ball. The problem was evident in India's foreign tours, where the opposition top-order scored tons of runs. And Bhuvneshwar Kumar's dip in form hasn't helped the skipper in the initial part of the innings. When Kumar's focus shifted from swing to speed, the problems started. \nAlso read: Bowlers need to be proactive against AB de Villiers, says Rohit \nFormer India batsman Sanjay Manjrekar shed light on the medium pacers' issue in quotes published by ESPNcricinfo, which said: \"When Bhuvneshwar arrived on the international scene and got all of us excited in that T20 game against Pakistan, it was his big banana swing that caught the eye. Did anyone notice what speed he was bowling at back then? It didn't matter because he was bamboozling the batsmen with swing.\" \nKumar's form will be critical to India's chances as he is capable of putting the squeeze on the opposition's scoring rate in the death overs, which is a desirable attribute to have going into the World T20 next year. \nHarbhajan Singh should make it count \nHarbhajan Singh was brought into the squad as cover for the injured offspinner Ashwin. And he is expected to make it to the playing XI on Wednesday. The offspinner who has been in and out of the team should see this as a good opportunity and lead the bowling attack. Harbhajan's experience, if used to the fullest, will come in handy in the middle overs and will help Dhoni to rotate the other bowlers around the veteran. A more attacking line and a bigger heart to give the ball some time in the air should trouble South African batsmen. \nCan Suresh Raina be the finisher? \nIndia's finishing woes compounded when Raina, along with his skipper, struggled batting down the order. On Sunday, Raina failed to pick up a googly from Imran Tahir and eventually perished without adding to the tally. Raina has the ability to finish games, snatch the game away from opponents with ease and his performances for his IPL club Chennai Super Kings instantiate the claim. But when it comes to playing with blue jersey, he has not been the same. Off the 189 innings in his career, Raina has stayed at the crease for more than 50 balls on only 40 occasions. In the recent past, he has struggled facing the short balls and the opposition have always attacked him by pitching the ball halfway on the track. Raina has to overcome his shortcomings and repay his captain's faith on him. Dhoni has always defended the Uttar Pradesh batsman and has even said Raina would be best suited to finish games for the team. It's high time the left handed batsman assumes responsibility and provides support to the top-order. \nFor more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @indiatoday and on Facebook at facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in . ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:32:15.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
