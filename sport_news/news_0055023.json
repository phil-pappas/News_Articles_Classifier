His hands apparently never received the memo. The wide receiver had a day to forget on Sunday, dropping six of the eight passes Tom Brady threw his way in the Patriots’ 30-23 victory over the New York Jets at Gillette Stadium. “Performance?” LaFell asked. “If I had to give myself a grade it would be an ‘F.’” No question, LaFell didn’t earn a passing grade. “No excuses,” said LaFell. “I just let the ball get on my hands too much.” Time and time again the ball clanged off his hands, LaFell managing to hold on to just two passes for 25 yards. Placed on the PUP list following offseason surgery on his foot, the game marked the 2015 debut for a player, who, after being signed away from Carolina as a free agent in March 2014, made 74 receptions for 953 yards and seven touchdowns in his first season in New England. “First game, last game, it doesn’t matter. I expect more out of myself and my teammates expect more from me,” said LaFell. “I’m just real down on myself right now, but I’m happy for the other guys around me, stepping their level of play up and (they) held on for us and made plays when we needed it.” Brady by the numbers: Earlier this season, Patriots quarterback Tom Brady hit 400. Brady’s 1-yard touchdown pass to Danny Amendola in the second quarter of the Patriots’ 51-17 rout of the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sept. 27 was the 400th of his career, putting him in the company of Peyton Manning, Brett Favre and Dan Marino as the only players in NFL history to reach that number (Drew Brees has since joined the club as well). On Sunday, Brady hit 213 and 55,000. Making the 213th regular-season start of his career, Brady surpassed Patriots Hall of Fame offensive tackle Bruce Armstrong (1987-2000) for the most starts in team history. Brady’s appearances in 215 regular-season games is also a franchise mark. His 16 seasons with the Patriots tie him with Steve Grogan (1975-1990) for the most in franchise history. With 355 yards passing in Sunday’s game, Brady pushed his career total to 55,312, making him the fifth player in league history to reach 55,000 (Favre, Manning, Marino and Brees rank first-through-fourth). The 300-yard game was the 68th of Brady’s career, third most in league history to Manning’s 92 and Brees’ 90. Oh, yes, with 15 yards, including a 1-yard touchdown, on four carries, Brady was the Patriots’ leading ground gainer in the game. Page 2 of 2 - Gronk’s best: Tight end Rob Gronkowski’s 11 receptions were a career high, one more than his previous best of 10 in the Patriots’ 45-10 playoff win over Denver on Jan. 14, 2012. Gronkowski’s previous best in a regular-season game was nine, something he’s accomplished three times. His aim is true: Connecting from 38, 46 and 24 yards, place-kicker Stephen Gostkowski has now converted 24 consecutive field goals dating to last season, a personal best that is one shy of Adam Vinatieri’s franchise-record 25 straight during the 1996 and 1997 seasons. With three more point-after conversions, Gostkowski extended his league record in that department to 435 in a row. The seven who sat: All seven Patriots inactives for the game were health-related decisions: running backs Brandon Bolden (hamstring) and Dion Lewis (abdomen), wide receiver Keshawn Martin (hamstring), offensive linemen Marcus Cannon (toe) and Shaq Mason (foot), defensive lineman Jabaal Sheard (ankle) and linebacker Rufus Johnson (illness).
