(Image Source: Al Bello/Getty Images) \nWeek 4 preview: \n-Catch it Like Beckham: On Sunday, New York Giants WR Odell Beckham Jr. will be playing his 16 th career game. He has 110 receptions through 15 games, which is already a record for most catches in the first 16 games to start a career. \nHe should also own the record for most receiving yards through 16 games after Sunday. Beckham comes into New York’s contest at Buffalo with 1,574 career yards, just 19 short of Bill Groman’s (Houston Oilers) mark set in 1960-61. In his first 15 games, Beckham has reached the century mark eight times; something Groman did nine times in the first 16 games of his career. \n-Spreading Out the Wins: Through three weeks, 28 of the 32 teams (87.5 percent) have won a game, which is the third-most after Week 3 since the league realigned in 2002. In 2012, 30 teams had a win by the end of Week 3 and there were 29 last season. \nOne of the four teams that were winless heading into Week 4, the Baltimore Ravens, got their first W of the 2015 campaign on Thursday night. The record for most clubs with a victory four weeks into the season is 30, which the league can tie or break this Sunday depending on how the Chicago Bears (vs. Oakland), Detroit Lions (at Seattle) and New Orleans Saints (vs. Dallas) fare. \n-Peyton’s Place: In addition to being one of the most prolific passers in NFL history, QB Peyton Manning is also one of the winningest regular season QBs. The Broncos are 3-0 and if they win this Sunday against the Minnesota Vikings, Manning will start a season 4-0 for the seventh time in his career, a record in the Super Bowl era. \nThe only other active quarterbacks with as many as three 4-0 starts are Tom Brady and Drew Brees , while Fran Tarkenton is second all time with four such starts to a season. \n-Julio’s Schoolyard: Atlanta Falcons WR Julio Jones is doing whatever he wants on the football field. He has set an NFL record with 34 receptions (440 yards, 4 TDs) through three games and needs just seven on Sunday to break Wes Welker’s mark for catches (40 receptions) at the quarter pole. \nPassing Welker for most receiving yards (616 yards) through four games will be a little more challenging, as Jones needs 177 yards on Sunday. Although, he has topped 135 receiving yards in each game this season so don’t count him out. \n-High-Flying Cardinals: Known more for their D over the past few seasons, the Arizona Cardinals have come out swinging on offense this season, riding an NFL-high 126 points to a 3-0 start. The Cards have scored 48 and 47 points in the past two weeks and have put up at least 31 points in every game. \nThey are averaging 42 points per game and need 37 against the St. Louis Rams to pass the 2002 Oakland Raiders (162 points) for the fourth-most points scored through four games. The 1966 Dallas Cowboys have the NFL record with 183 points through four games. \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
