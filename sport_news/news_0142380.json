But for what it lacks in money, the southern club makes up for with a smart recruitment policy and the quality of its training academy. Eleven players from the current professional squad have been nurtured at the club. \n\"We want to keep it up and continue the adventure,\" said Nice coach Claude Puel. \"We'll see where it leads us.\" \nFEKIR'S ABSENCE FATAL TO LYON \nWinless in the Champions League after three matches and already lagging 10 points behind PSG in the league, Lyon is at a low point these days. \nAccording to club president Jean-Michel Aulas, Nabil Fekir's injury is the source of his players' problems. \n\"I can guarantee you that with Nabil we would be on the league's podium and that we would have six more points in the Champions League,\" Aulas said in an interview with L'Equipe newspaper. \nThe problem for Lyon is that Fekir is unlikely to play again before next spring after rupturing his right knee ligaments playing for France last month. \nDER ZAKARIAN's DIZZY SPELL \nNantes coach Michel Der Zakarian was unable to direct Wednesday's training session after fainting upon arrival at the club's facilities. \nDer Zakarian was briefly hospitalized with severe headache and could be replaced by deputy coach Bruno Baronchelli for Saturday's trip to third-place Caen. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:06:09.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
