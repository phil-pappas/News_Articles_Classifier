(Photo: AP Photo) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nPHILADELPHIA Eagles coach Chip Kelly said he has no intention of changing kickers even though Caleb Sturgis missed an extra point and a field goal Sunday. \nThe four points were the difference in the Eagles' 23-20 loss to Washington, just like Cody Parkey's missed field goal was the difference in the Eagles' 26-24 loss to Atlanta in the season opener. Parkey was placed on injured reserve last week with a groin injury, which led to Sturgis' signing. \n\"We're going to stay with Caleb,\" Kelly said Monday. \"We looked at what's available out there and … I think the state of kicking in the league right now is not very good. There have been a lot of changes.\" \nAnd as much as Kelly pointed out that, \"You hit two kicks, we're sitting here 3-1 and everyone's happy,\" he also knows that the Eagles' problems for their 1-3 start go beyond that. He started with an offense that can't stay on the field because it hasn't converted third downs. For the season, the Eagles have converted 26.5 percent of their third downs, which ranks 27 th in the NFL. \n\"We need to execute the plays better,\" Kelly said. \"That's what we need to do.\" \nHow does he know that they can execute better. \n\"I've seen us move the ball,\" he said. \"I have confidence in this group. We just have to do it on a more consistent basis.\" \nKelly also said that he's aware of DeMarco Murray's comments that he's not getting the ball enough. Murray sounded off after the game, when he had eight carries for 36 yards. For the season, Murray has 47 yards on 29 carries. He had 534 yards after four games last season. \n\"We all should be getting more touches on the offensive side of the ball,\" Kelly said. \"But when you only have 51 snaps on offense, there aren't a lot of touches. If we can stay on the field and snap it for 68 or 70 plays, we'd have a lot more balance in our run and pass game because we're on the field longer.\" \nKelly said that's a product of the entire offense. So when asked if it appears to him that the offensive line is in chaos, he replied: \"I don't think it looks like 'chaos', I wouldn't say that word,\" he said. \"I think we've been out of sync a few times. We have the right guys. We're doing the right things … We've got to be able to help those guys out.\" \nSpeaking of the offensive line, Kelly said he didn't have updates on left tackle Jason Peters, who removed himself in the first quarter after re-injuring his quad, or Lane Johnson, who left briefly with a knee injury but finished out the game. \nBut that's a big loss if one or both of those players can't play this Sunday against New Orleans. \nIn addition, Kelly didn't have updates on the other players who left the game with injuries and didn't return _ cornerback Byron Maxwell (quadriceps), inside linebacker Mychal Kendricks (hamstring) and defensive end Brandon Bair (groin) in the first quarter. \nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com .
