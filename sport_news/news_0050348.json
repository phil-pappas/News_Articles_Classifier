In doing so, it provides an effective way for emergency rescue personnel to locate an individual. As a result, it enhances safety and it could help to prevent injuries. The invention features a portable and lightweight design that requires no setup and is convenient and easy to use by both children and adults. It is ideal for use by scouts, mountain climbers, open-water divers, hikers, outdoor enthusiasts, families, etc. Additionally, the SURVIVOR FLARE is easy to carry and store when not in use, and could be sold over the counter in most stores.\nThe inventor described the invention design, \"My design assists rescue personnel in locating individuals in an outdoor emergency situation over sea or land.\"\nThe original design was submitted to the Tampa office of InventHelp.
