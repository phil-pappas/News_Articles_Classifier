Posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 1:07 pm Jaclyn Shambaugh: Scotland and Pinecrest meet in the showdown of the season By Jaclyn Shambaugh - Staff writer \nFinally, it’s here. \nScotland hosts Pinecrest on Friday in what is surely is the biggest game of the season in the Cape Fear region. \nThis rivalry has been growing in proportion to Pinecrest’s success over the last several years. \nLast season was the first time the Patriots looked capable enough to handle the Fighting Scots, but Scotland took a 29-22 win in Southern Pines. \nI expect this year’s game to be just as close. \nThe home-field advantage is slight for Scotland. Sure, the Scots’ crowd will be engaged and likely loud enough to shake that bright new scoreboard. \nBut Pinecrest fans travel well, and the 40-minute drive down U.S. 501 really isn’t much to folks in the Southeastern 4-A Conference, a league that spans five counties. \nBoth teams have put up some astonishing numbers this season. \nThe Patriots are averaging almost 50 points per game and allowing only 13. Scotland’s also strong on both sides, scoring 40 points per game with opponents averaging 16. Pinecrest’s opponents are 20-27 overall, and Scotland’s are 26-26. \nEach team has faced strong opponents, and each has had a stinker or two on its schedule. \nScotland might have the edge mentally. After all, Pinecrest hasn’t beaten Scotland since 2009 in what went on to become a 10-win season for the Patriots and a two-win year for the Scots. \nCoach Chris Metzger has done much to hone the Patriots’ mental strength, and that edge is particularly evident in the way players on the offensive side of the ball can rotate in and out of the spotlight without a hitch. \nThis is one of those weeks I’m glad I don’t have to make predictions about games. That dubious honor belongs to our scholastic sports editor, Earl Vaughan Jr. \nThis is the sort of game that could come down to a turnover, an athletic special teams play or a key defensive stop. \nWhatever the result, I’m betting this will be the best football we see during the regular season, and maybe all year long. \nBears’ defense shines \nGray’s Creek turned in a major defensive effort against Southern Lee in its win Friday. \nGray’s Creek has had trouble in the past with mobile quarterbacks, such as the Cavaliers’ Ishois Times. \nThe Bears didn’t give up much to the Cavs’ running game on the whole, and Times’ 51 yards were the most of any Cavalier. \nThe Bears’ defensive performance bodes well for success as Gray’s Creek takes on the rest of Cape Fear Valley 3-A Conference, where athletic backfields are the norm. \nStaff writer Jaclyn Shambaugh can be reached at 609-0651 or shambaughj@fayobserver.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T09:46:59.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
