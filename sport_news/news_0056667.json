All three teams are 5-0, but Northwestern has more quality wins (Stanford, at Duke, Minnesota) and, with the top defense in the nation, has been more impressive. \nThat resume has the Wildcats at No. 13 in the AP poll . Meanwhile, No. 1 Ohio State, which barely held off an Indiana team that lost its quarterback and running back to injuries, and No. 4 Michigan State, which had to hang on for a three-point win over lowly Purdue, maintained their spot near the top of the national rankings. \nThe first weekend of Big Ten football was full of defensive struggles and nasty weather that led to some ugly games. A pair of West Division matchups took center stage. Northwestern blanked Minnesota, 27-0, and Iowa out-slugged Wisconsin, 10-6, to move ahead early in the division race. \nRELATED : Rutgers football Week 6 opponent: Michigan State at a glance \nCheck out the Week 4 power rankings to see how much teams moved up or down.
