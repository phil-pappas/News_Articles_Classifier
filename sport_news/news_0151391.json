As a result, Martin has a head-start on the playbook.\nHowever, the wide receiver still has catching up to do.\n“I feel like I have a good part down,” he said. “A lot of stuff is similar from Houston, but there’s still some things that I need to learn and I’m going to just plug away.”\nOn Monday, receivers coach Chad O’Shea explained that Martin isn’t just trying to learn one position. In the Patriots offense, it’s critical for the No. 4 wideout to be ready to play inside or outside the numbers.\n“It’s important for each of the guys to know exactly what’s expected of them on that play, and not only the starters, but the guys that are in those backup spots, the guys that are critical to backing up all the spots — like Keshawn Martin,” O’Shea said. “His role for us in the game is to make sure he’s available to know all the spots, so he needs to be on the same page if something is adjusted or there is some type of communication made.”\nWhile learning the playbook is paramount, Martin made his first impact as a Patriot by going off script in the third quarter of last weekend’s 51-17 win over the Jaguars.\nTom Brady was under duress and his pocket was collapsing, so the quarterback tucked the ball and escaped to his left.\nDown the field, Martin had his eyes up and made a savvy move, breaking off his pattern and cutting to the side that Brady was rolling to.\n“I just saw him scrambling so I wanted to get in a position so we could get something going,” Martin said.\nThey did get something going.\nMartin’s rerouting was so sharp that Jags cornerback Aaron Colvin fell down. Brady hit the open receiver in stride, and Martin walked into the Jacksonville end zone for his first touchdown as a Patriot.\nWhile the fourth-year player has been working to learn a number of roles on the offense, one familiar spot we haven’t seen him is returning kicks. Martin made his biggest impact in Houston on special teams, and he’s still prepared to play there if asked.\n“If they want to throw me in there, you know I’m ready for it,” Martin said. “Whatever makes the team win, that’s what I’m going to do.”\nIt’s clear Martin’s work on the field and in the meeting room has impressed the coaching staff.\nOn Wednesday, he trotted out to practice wearing a black jersey — signifying he’d been named one of the team’s practice players of the week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:21:59.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
