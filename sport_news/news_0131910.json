So I guess the answer to your question is no. Ultimately I'm responsible to know the rule. There were consequences to that. Those have been fulfilled.''\nNow that he's permitted to coach on game-day starting this Saturday in a Big Ten clash at Indiana, Flood said he doesn't believe he's on thin ice with university President Robert Barchi, who said after handing down his discipline that termination was considered for Flood's actions.\n\"I feel like I have an excellent relationship with Dr. Barchi,'' Flood said. \"I'll leave his comments for him to comment on. But I feel fully supported.''\nFlood started the 13-minute news conference by thanking university President Robert Barchi for, he said, \"the opportunity to return to the podium and coach Saturday's game against Indiana'' and then declined to go in depth on a number of specific questions pertaining to the report.\nWhen asked whether he knowingly broke the rule, Flood said: \"Dr. Barchi has referenced that to the university. I'm not going to go further into that. Ultimately the important thing is that I'm responsible know it.''\nThe report detailed the lengths in which Flood was warned by the university's academic support about contacting faculty and the independent law firm determined that Flood sought to hide his contact with the professor by using a private email address.\nIt was revealed in the report that Flood admitted he used the address so it would not be subject to the Open Public Records Act.\nOn Aug. 5 — four days before training camp began for the 2015 season — Flood met with the professor to discuss the grade outside the Princeton Public Library.\n\"Coach Flood told the professor that he purposefully didn't wear any Rutgers apparel or insignia so he wouldn't be recognized in public,\" the report said.\nAsked why he went to the lengths he did to conceal what he was doing, Flood said: \"I understand why when looked at out of context, people might feel that way. The issue with the private email was really just to protect the student-athlete, a student-athlete whose academic record had already been, to some degree, on public display when it shouldn't have been.\n\"The meeting with the professor was in on open courtyard in broad daylight. The comment about not having Rutgers gear on was very small-talkish type comment. But it's one of the things I've learned in this process, is that things like that when you're the head football coach, they can be taken out of context.''\nFlood said he's had \"a lot of interactions with the faculty on the practice field, at games, at functions'' but indicated he has never gone to these lengths to contact a professor about a player's grades before.\n\"Nothing of this context before,'' Flood said, \"and certainly not in the future.'\nRegarding the question of why he didn't leave it up to academic support to address the player's academic status, Flood said his intent was \"in the best interest of the student-athlete.''\n\"Going forward I need to make sure that not only do I make them in the best interest of the student-athlete, that I make them within the rules,'' he said.\nFlood, whose program has been under scrutiny amid a string of player arrests, said he doesn't believe his credibility will take a hit when he has to discipline players in the future.\n\"It's something that I addressed with the players,'' Flood said. \"I made a mistake. There are consequences to those actions. And those consequences have been fulfilled and now we move forward just I would with a player.''\nFlood said he has no control over the perception that he didn't take full accountability for his actions.\n\"I don't know if I can completely control perception,'' he said. \"What I know is this: The people that know me personally, the families of our players, the families of the recruits we're currently involved in, that issue doesn't exist. For the people who maybe don't know me as intimately as those groups of people do, I think the healing is going to take time and I understand that. I'm fully committed to making sure that that happens.''\nAfter apologizing \"to the entire Rutgers community, to the students, to the alumni and especially to the faculty,'' Flood said he's fully committed to the \"healing'' process.\n\"Since becoming the head coach in 2012, it's never been my goal to just be the head football coach at Rutgers,'' he said. \"My goal has always been to be a bigger part of the community here at Rutgers, a bigger part of the community in New Jersey, and I've worked very hard to make that happen. If this situation in any way has hindered or slowed that progress toward that goal, I'd just like to say that I'm fully committed as I go forward to making sure that that happens once again.''\nKeith Sargeant may be reached at ksargeant@njadvancemedia.com .
