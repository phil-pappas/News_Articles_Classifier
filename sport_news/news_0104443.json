The coast guard, which then rushed to the spot, recovered the corpses of another two women and a boy, while it was looking for a missing man, it said.\nThousands of refugees -- mostly fleeing war-torn Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq -- attempt daily to cross the Aegean Sea from neighbouring Turkey, a short trip but a perilous one in the inflatable boats the migrants use, often in rough seas.\nAlmost 400,000 people have arrived in Greece this year, according to the UN refugee agency UNHCR, overwhelming the cash-strapped nation's capacity.\nIn a separate incident, a boy, part of a group of about 110 people, drowned when he fell off a boat en route to the island of Farmakonisi. The rest of the people managed to get ashore.\nThe EU has offered Turkey 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) in aid and the prospect of easier travel visas and \"re-energised\" talks on joining the bloc if it helps stem the flow across its territory.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:14:56.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
