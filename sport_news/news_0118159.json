Frank Murtha knew his phone would be ringing soon.\nIn most parts of Chicago, or at least on the city's north side, beating the Pittsburgh Pirates in the National League wild-card game meant it was party time: The Cubbies...\n(Kent Babb) It's been years since we met, and only for a minute or two, in the eye of that maelstrom in 2003; me mocking the poor guy like some empty-headed jay, Steve just rocking and silent in his pain at Wrigley, a Cubs fan who knew what he'd done, facing the animal wrath of the entire Cubs nation, alone.\nThey showed him their teeth, hooting, waving their hands, touching their heads in anguish. It's what we primates do when we're in a crowd that's gone mad. That kind of thing changes people, fans, and columnists too.\n\"Did it change Steve? Not really. He's continued to live the life that he lived,\" Murtha said, then paused.\n\"But then again, was it a life-changing event? Yes. Of course and it's amazing the way he's handled it, amazing that the city won't let it go.\"\nIt's been 12 years since the Cubs were in the National League Championship Series and Steve reached for that foul ball and Moises Alou couldn't make the catch and stamped his feet like a pouty child.\nIt's been 12 years since that night when I went up to him, to my shame, taking notes on a Walgreens receipt, asking in fake astonishment: \"Do you realize what you've just done?\" as the Friendly Confines turned ugly and fans cussed him and the beer came at him in arcs and his life was threatened.\nAnd 12 years of publicity stunts taking advantage of his pain: The slickster who grabbed the ball and sold it, the steakhouse that blew up the ball and used pieces for sauce, everyone cashing in but the man who paid.\nMurtha said Bartman liked a recent column of mine suggesting the Cubs should organize an \"Apologize to Steve\" ceremony at Wrigley for the fans to expiate their guilt; that they serve some tasty goat broth with rice to block the goat curse; and that Cubs executive Crane Kenney receive the Moutza from 40,000 plus fans on national TV for saying his decision to ask a priest for a holy blessing at Wrigley was \"one of the dumbest\" things he'd ever done.\nCubs fans, apologize to Steve Bartman before it's too late John Kass If you're somewhat cruel and evil, it's easy to pull the wings off nervous and vulnerable Chicago Cubs fans.\nThey have a great young team and a top manager and are fighting to make the playoffs.

And the Crane Kenney bit. Every time you or somebody else writes about him, people ask, 'Does he go to games?'\n\"About 40 calls this week, maybe twice that,\" Murtha said. \"Reporters all want the same thing. A, they want to talk to him. B, they ask, 'How's he doing? Can we do an interview?' and then sometimes, it's C.\"\nWhat's the C?\n\"Some TV types want to pay him,\" Murtha said. \"They call it an 'appearance fee.' One called just before you did, dangling $7,500. And I'm thinking, didn't they read about him? Don't they do their research, don't they know he turned down six figure deals. But they don't know a thing about him. They can't comprehend it.\"\nAfter Bartman reached for the ball and caught hell, it was assumed he'd follow the standard postmodern American script and sell his shame for a profit.\nHe didn't. His refusal was a mystery to many, until a word often misused and almost unspeakable was offered:\nHonor.\nIf Bartman had taken the money for the commercials, stuffed that six-figure check in his pocket and became another cartoon to be poked at by half-wits, he'd have receded into the wallpaper like others before him.\nBut he didn't take the money. He didn't sell himself or his love for the Cubs. He issued a statement apologizing to the Cubs and his fellow Cubs fans and disappeared.\nThe meme of sports commentators is all this stuff about Bartman and goat curses doesn't matter, that only the games and players matter and that the rest is foolishness. I know why they say this. The game is the thing.\nBut you can't ignore human hearts. That's part of baseball, that church of baseball feeling that binds generations. And Cubs fans remember because their baseball souls were cleaved by that black cat and Cubs collapse in 1969; others can't forget the smug face of the Padres' Steve Garvey in 1984.\nAnd of course, that night 12 years ago, when they so despised Bartman. And now, I think, most have forgiven him.\nThe only way Chicago can let it go is for the Cubs to get to the World Series. A city waits, and so does Steve.\njskass@tribpub.com\nTwitter @John_Kass\n Chicago Cubs Wrigley Field National League Championship Series Steve Garvey Commentary Opinion", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56195d83/turbine/ct-steve-bartman-20151010", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55f3a642/turbine/ct-kass-cubs-met-0913-20150911", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5626c6cc/turbine/ct-bartman-lawyer-kass-met-1021-20151020"], "published": "2015-10-21T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:21:12.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
