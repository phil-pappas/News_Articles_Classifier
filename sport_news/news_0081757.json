Carson Russell said it had to do with focus, which surely wasn’t wrong. Williams High School saw its 14-point halftime lead slip away amid loads of penalties and a dual-pronged Rockingham County rushing attack in a second half where nothing could go right. The result was a 26-14 loss to the Cougars on Thursday night in Mid-State 3-A Conference football at Burlington Memorial Stadium. It’s the fourth straight loss for Williams (2-5 overall, 0-4 Mid-State 3-A Conference) to begin league play. “It’s tough,” said Gee, a lineman. “They found some points that were working for them and kept attacking there. It really came down to them executing more than us.” The Bulldogs didn’t have an answer in the second half for Rockingham County’s John Harris and Jackie Moore, who combined for 212 yards rushing, and Moore scored three touchdowns. The Cougars had 11 first downs in the second half after recording just three in the first half. “We finally got an adjustment, but it was too late,” Grant said. “We have to learn to finish. I’ll take some of that on me.” After leading 14-0 at the break, the Bulldogs punted on their first drive of the second half. Rockingham County (4-3, 3-1) drove 69 yards on nine plays — all except one were rushes by Moore or Harris — to get on the board with a 1-yard Moore touchdown. Williams went three-and-out, and Rockingham County answered in two plays with a 21-yard touchdown run down the left sideline by Moore. The two-point conversion failed to keep the Bulldogs ahead, 14-13. Two holding penalties put Williams in a first-and-34, after which Russell threw three straight incompletions. Rockingham County then took the lead on a 7-yard run by Zach Bullard, who racked up 54 rushing yards on four carries. Williams was forced to punt once again, and the Cougars tacked on another score with a 2-yard run by Moore. Russell was intercepted with a little more than a minute left. The Bulldogs’ 13 penalties tallied 100 yards. “We kind of shot ourselves in the foot really badly in the second half with penalties,” Russell said. “In the first half, we stopped them on defense, shut them out. We drove down with the ball and did whatever we wanted on offense. The second half, we just killed ourselves with penalties.” After a scoreless first quarter, Torrence Williams scored a 6-yard rushing touchdown to put the Bulldogs up 6-0. On their next drive, Russell punched it in on fourth-and-goal at the 1-yard line, and his two-point conversion pass was complete to Sydney McAdoo for a 14-0 lead. Page 2 of 2 - Williams’ Jacob Grimm missed a 34-yard field goal as time expired in the half. “It was all about executing,” Rockingham County coach Derrick Minor said. “We didn’t come out and execute in the first half. We didn’t change anything we did. We just said it’s time to step it up. We were letting two guys, (Gee and Williams), disrupt our whole team. That’s hat’s off to them. But we had to respond, and we came out and said let’s execute.” By Tommy Hamzik", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:14:34.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
