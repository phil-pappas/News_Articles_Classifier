The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1 percent to 17,217.11 and the Standard & Poor’s 500 fell 0.1 percent, to 2,030.77. \nBenchmark U.S. crude fell below $46 a barrel. \nThe dollar gained against the yen and fell against the euro. \nTHE DAY AHEAD \nMajor business events scheduled for Wednesday \nUNDATED (AP) — Third quarter earnings announcements continue today, with Boeing, Coca-Cola and General Motors reporting results before the market opens. American Express reports quarterly financial results after the market closes. \nJAPAN-TRADE \nJapan’s Sept trade deficit bigger than forecast $95 billion \nTOKYO (AP) — Japan’s trade deficit in September was a worse than forecast 114.48 trillion yen ($95 billion) as exports slowed, especially to China. \nThe trade data released Wednesday showed exports rose only 0.6 percent from the year before to 6.42 trillion yen (53 billion) while imports fell 11 percent, to 6.53 trillion yen ($54 billion). \nMany economists had forecast that the trade balance would be in positive territory for the month. \nExports to China fell 3.5 percent from the year before, while exports to the U.S. jumped 10.4 percent. \nJapan’s trade balance has improved with the fall in prices of crude oil and other fuels. In September, imports of oil, gas and coal fell 36 percent from the year before. \nThe trade deficit in September of 2014 was 961.98 billion yen. \nGENETIC TESTING-23ANDME \n23andMe returns with FDA-approved genetic health tests \nWASHINGTON (AP) — Genetic testing company 23andMe is reintroducing some health screening tools that federal regulators forced off the market more than two years ago, due to concerns about their accuracy and interpretation by customers. \nThe Google-backed company says it will again offer 35 tests that tell users whether they carry genetic mutations for rare diseases like cystic fibrosis, which can be passed from parents to children. \nThe relaunch comes as the Silicon Valley company works to mend its relationship with the Food and Drug Administration, which ordered 23andMe to stop selling its health-related tests in 2013. FDA officials signed off on the returning tests earlier this year. \nCEO Anne Wojcicki said 23andMe submitted studies to the FDA showing that users can understand genetic test results without the aid of a doctor or health counselor. \nThe relaunch is only a partial victory, since 23andMe still cannot offer more than 250 risk reports included in its original product, which purported to tell users if they were likely to develop diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. \nMore than 1 million people have used the company’s saliva-based test kit, a small plastic tube that customers fill with spit and return to the company for processing. \nUNITED NATIONS-BRIBERY SCHEME \nIndictment brings additional bribery charges in UN case \nNEW YORK (AP) — Federal prosecutors beefed up charges Tuesday in a bribery conspiracy case that has ensnared a former president of the U.N. General Assembly, a Dominican Republic diplomat and a Chinese billionaire. \nThe indictment in Manhattan federal court boosts bribery charges brought against 67-year-old wealthy real estate mogul Ng (eng) Lap Seng and Francis Lorenzo, 48, a suspended ambassador to the United Nations from the Dominican Republic, and two others. And it adds a money laundering charge against the men. \nBut no new charges were brought against John Ashe, 61, a former U.N. ambassador from Antigua and Barbuda who served as president of the U.N. General Assembly for one year until a year ago. He faced tax charges when he was arrested two weeks ago on allegations contained in a criminal complaint. \nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon has ordered an audit of two foundations whose leaders are linked to the bribery case. \nHe has said through a spokesman that there will be no tolerance for corruption at the U.N. or in the name of the United Nations. \nFERRARI-IPO Ferrari for sale: Legendary brand races toward share listing \nMILAN (AP) — Ferrari is racing toward a public share offering this week, making it possible for investors to buy a piece of the legendary maker of luxury sports cars and Formula One racing machines. \nThe parent company, mass-market carmaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, will float almost a tenth of the company’s shares on Wall Street on Wednesday under the stock name RACE. \nFiat Chrysler priced the offering at $52 a share late Tuesday, valuing the company founded in 1929 by Italian sports driver Enzo Ferrari at almost $10 billion. \nThe brand, which is based in Maranello, in northern Italy, has grown over the years to become an emblem of high performance and wealth. It has a record number of constructors’ world championships in Formula One and its coveted street cars sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars. \nYAHOO-GOOGLE SEARCH \nYahoo to team up with Google in Internet search, advertising \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Yahoo is leaning on Google’s expertise in Internet search and advertising in its latest attempt to boost its revenue. \nThe proposed three-year partnership was announced Tuesday after Yahoo released its third-quarter results. The numbers represented the latest in a long succession of disappointing performances for Yahoo, with the company’s net revenue slipping 8 percent from the previous year. \nYahoo Inc. tried to team up with Google in search during 2008 as part of its defense against a takeover attempt by Microsoft. The Google alliance unraveled after the U.S. Justice Department threatened to block the partnership on the grounds that it would thwart competition. \nThe new deal still must be approved by antitrust regulators. Yahoo will still rely on technology from Microsoft’s Bing search engine as part of a 6-year-old partnership. \nSEC NOMINEES \nObama nominating 2 women for SEC \nWASHINGTON (AP) — President Barack Obama is nominating two women, both attorneys and academics at Washington-area universities, as members of the Securities and Exchange Commission to fill vacancies on the five-member SEC. \nThe White House announced the nominations Tuesday. \nThey are Lisa Fairfax, a Democrat, who teaches law at George Washington University, and Hester Peirce, a Republican, who heads a financial markets program at George Mason University and was formerly a Senate aide. \nIf they are confirmed by the Senate, four of the five SEC commissioners will be women. \nThe independent agency oversees Wall Street and the financial markets. It is headed by Mary Jo White, a former federal prosecutor and attorney in private practice. White is an Independent. The other two commissioners are Kara Stein, a Democrat, and Michael Piwowar, a Republican. \nGENERAL MOTORS-ELECTRIC CAR \nGM says Chevy Bolt electric range could be over 200 miles \nWARREN, Mich. (AP) — General Motors executives are saying that the company’s entry into the long-range electric vehicle market should go more than 200 miles on a single charge. \nThe company also plans to market the hatchback Chevrolet Bolt as a crossover SUV when it comes out late next year. \nThe comments were made at an event at GM’s technical center north of Detroit announcing joint development efforts with LG Electronics of Korea to design Bolt components. LG Electronics will jointly design and build the Bolt’s electric motor, infotainment screen and other components. LG Chem already has worked with GM on the battery design. \nGM product development chief Mark Reuss (Royce) said the company’s 200-mile range estimate for the Bolt is a bit conservative. He would not give an exact number. \nHTC-NEW SMARTPHONE \nHTC unveils new version of new ‘One’ smartphone \nNEW YORK (AP) — HTC has unveiled the latest version of its One smartphone, touting its combination of sleek design with the latest Android software. \nThe HTC One A9 goes on sale globally in early November and offers an all-metal and glass design with smooth curves. In addition to the traditional smartphone colors of gray, sliver and gold, it also comes in garnet red. \nThe phone is the first outside of Google’s own Nexus line to feature that company’s Marshmallow software at launch. And it’s the first regular-sized HTC phone to have a fingerprint sensor — a feature already standard on phones made my larger rivals Apple and Samsung. \nU.S. preorders for silver and gray phones are now being taken through HTC’s website for $400. The other colors will be available within weeks. \nMADOFF-FUNDS \nMadoff trustee: Allowable claims under $1.1M to be all paid \nNEW YORK (AP) — The trustee recovering money lost by investors with imprisoned financier Bernard Madoff has reported a new milestone, saying a new distribution will mean allowable claims of $1.1 million or less will have been fully reimbursed. \nTrustee Irving Picard made the announcement Tuesday as he asked a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge to approve a $1.18 billion distribution to investors. \nIn a release, the trustee said the distribution will increase the total amount already returned to investors to about $9.1 billion of $17.5 billion in allowable claims. The trustee has recovered or reached deals to recover about $10.9 billion since the fraud was revealed in December 2008 with Madoff’s arrest. \nThe 77-year-old Madoff is serving a 150-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to fraud charges, admitting his Ponzi scheme lasted decades. \nMISLEADING BEER \nBeer money: $20M settlement in lawsuit over Beck’s packaging \nMIAMI (AP) — A $20 million lawsuit settlement has been approved that would give cash to drinkers of U.S.-brewed Beck’s beer over misleading packaging emphasizing its German origins. \nA Miami federal judge approved the national settlement Tuesday. It could mean up to $50 for each household with proof of Beck’s purchases and $12 for those without receipts. A claims website is at www.becksbeersettlement.com . \nBeck’s was brewed in Bremen, Germany, for more than 100 years before its 2002 purchase by the company now known as Anheuser- Busch InBev. Although the beer for U.S. consumers was made in St. Louis, Missouri, beginning in 2012, the lawsuit contended U.S. connections were downplayed in packaging that continued to boost links to Germany. \nAttorney Tucker Ronzetti says consumers were unfairly charged higher import prices for a U.S. beer. \nHULK HOGAN-RESTAURANT \nRestaurant sold; will no longer carry Hulk Hogan brand \nTAMPA, Fla. (AP) — A local real estate investor says he’s closed the sale of the 261-room Best Western Bay Harbor hotel in Tampa that includes the Hulk Hogan-themed restaurant called Hogan’s Beach for $34.5 million. \nBen Mallah told the Tampa Bay Times (http://bit.ly/1jS5WZY) the sale to the Chicago-based Oxford Capital Group closed Monday. \nMallah said the new owners are planning renovations. The Hogan’s Beach sign visible from the Courtney Campbell Causeway has been removed. \nThe sale ends the former professional wrestler’s association with the property. Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, licensed his name to the restaurant but didn’t have an ownership interest. \nEarlier in the year, Hogan was dropped by World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. after a video transcript surfaced showing him making racist comments.
