Signs have been pointing to Elias, 39, beginning the season on injured reserve for a while as he has missed all of training camp with a sore right knee.\nDevils coach John Hynes classified Elias' absence as \"indefinite.\"\n\"Elias, he's still in the same situation right now,\" Hynes said Thursday. \"There's been no update or progress with him right now.\"\nThe Devils are taking a cautious approach with Elias, the club's all-time leader in goals, assists and points, as he rehabs his knee in hope that the injury won't turn into something that causes him to miss time again later in the season. \nElias said last week that he had an MRI on the knee, but \"there wasn't anything there that we didn't already know.\"\nAt this point, though, the Devils don't want to throw him into a regular-season game after he hasn't practiced or played this preseason.\n\"He's skated a couple times on his own, but that's it,\" general manager Ray Shero said Wednesday.\nAlthough the Devils have been transparent about the nature of Elias' injury, they are being vague about Palmieri's ailment, which he suffered when he fell awkwardly into the end boards in the second period of Wednesday night's 4-2 preseason win over the Flyers.\nFollowing the game, Hynes called it \"a little minor tweak.\" After Palmieri did not practice Thursday, Hynes maintained that the team does not view the injury as significant.\nPalmieri likely will sit out tonight's preseason finale against the Flyers at Prudential Center.\n\"It will be a day-to-day, touch-and-go type of thing, but it's nothing too serious right now,\" he said. \"We just held him off the ice today for treatment and just some precautionary things to see how he's feeling.\"\nDefenseman Marc-Andre Gragnani also did not practice Thursday because of a hip flexor injury suffered at Tuesday's practice. \nIn addition, right wing Tyler Kennedy remained away from the team for the second consecutive day for personal reasons. Hynes was unsure whether Kennedy, who is attending camp as an unsigned tryout, will be back in time for tonight's game.\nVERMONT BOUND: The Devils will head to Brattleboro, Vt., on Sunday and Monday for a team-bonding trip. The players will participate in off-ice team-building activities and also practice Monday at a rink in nearby Greenfield, Mass.\n\"It will be fun,\" defenseman Andy Greene said. \"Like we've said a lot, there are a lot of new faces everywhere and it will be good to get away … for a day or two there and get away together and not have to worry about anyone else and just do whatever is in store.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:32:59.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
