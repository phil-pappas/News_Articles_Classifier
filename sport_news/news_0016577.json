Alabama quarterback Jake Coker hit Ridley in stride. Ridley ran the rest of the way for an 81-yard touchdown that gave the Tide a 10-7 lead.\nAlabama followed with 17 additional unanswered points en route to a 27-14 win.\n\"It was huge for us having Calvin just be the playmaker that he is and Jacob throwing a great ball,\" Tide wide receiver Richard Mullaney said. \"It was big for us.\"\nRELATED: Inside the play that 'swung the momentum' during Alabama's win over Arkansas\nRedshirt sophomore Robert Foster and Ridley were co-starters at one of the team's two outside receiver spots early in the season.\nAlabama-Arkansas post game recap with Nick Saban Nick Saban talks about the momentum change after the half.\nRidley — whom Rivals ranked as the top wide receiver prospect in this year's recruiting class — stepped into a bigger role after Foster suffered a season-ending shoulder injury in Alabama's third game Sept. 19.\nAfter posting modest totals of seven catches for 59 yards in the Tide's first two games, Ridley caught six passes for 28 yards against Ole Miss Sept. 19.\nHe caught his first college touchdown the next week, a 15-yard scoring catch as part of a four-catch, 38-yard performance during Alabama's win over Louisiana Monroe.\nRidley has broken through even more the last two games while beginning to establish himself as the Tide's top wide receiver.\nRidley caught five passes for 120 yards and a touchdown during Alabama's 38-10 win over Georgia Oct. 3.\nHe caught a 45-yard touchdown in the second quarter to give the Tide a 24-3 lead after getting behind two Bulldogs defensive backs on a deep route over the middle.\nRidley finished with a career-high nine catches for a career-best 140 touchdowns and the touchdown against Arkansas Saturday.\n\"When I got here, I knew that he was just a special guy — just how fast he is, how great of routes he runs, how he catches the ball,\" Mullaney, a graduate transfer, said. \"And I feel like he's just calmed down into the system and has really gotten to know the plays, feels comfortable out there, and he's just making plays and doing big things for us.\"\nRidley leads No. 8 Alabama with 29 catches and 385 receiving yards through six games.\nRidley and Mullaney are tied for the team-lead with three touchdown catches.\n\"I've always thought he was really talented since the day he got here,\" Coker said. \"Now that he's getting more and more comfortable, it's getting exciting to see what he can do.\"\nJake Coker talks Arkansas win Jake Coker talks Arkansas win", "external_links": ["https://vine.co/v/e27nq2UHuie/embed/simple", "https://vine.co/v/e0t0xh1tmjB/embed/simple", "https://vine.co/v/e0tE76MWPpp/embed/simple", "https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:02:48.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
