The South Korean firm told the AP that it doesn't \"have any comment at the present time regarding Sepp Blatter or our current FIFA sponsorship status.\" \nKia didn't respond when asked if that meant its FIFA deal, which runs through 2022, is no longer certain. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T13:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:52:58.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
