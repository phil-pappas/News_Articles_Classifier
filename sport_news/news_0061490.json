AHL veteran Zac Dalpe broke a 1-0 Moose lead with two goals for Iowa. Manitoba finished the pre-season 1-1-0. \nHead coach Keith McCambridge dressed an experienced roster that should have some resemblance to the one he uses Oct. 9 when the Moose begin their regular season on the road against the Toronto Marlies. \nMcCambridge used forwards Joel Armia, Patrice Cormier, Matt Fraser and Matt Halischuk. Highly touted Jets defensive prospect Josh Morrissey made his AHL pre-season debut. Rookie prospect Chase De Leo, who had two assists in a 3-0 win against Iowa on Friday, played again. Winnipeggers Peter Stoykewich and Brendan O’Donnell also dressed. \nBrandon product Brock Trotter, a forward who is in training camp with the Moose on a try-out deal, did not play. Veteran defenseman Andrew MacWilliam also sat out. \nIncumbent starting goaltender Connor Hellebuyck played for the first time since the Jets sent him to the Moose earlier in the week and made 31 saves. Hellebuyck is coming off a rookie AHL season in which he had a .921 save percentage and a 2.58 goals-against average. \nMoose forward Ryan Olsen’s hard work in front of Iowa goaltender Leland Irving grabbed the game’s first goal. Olsen outbattled net-front coverage and jabbed a loose puck past Irving with 2:19 remaining in the first period. \nDalpe tied the game for Iowa late in the second period. Dalpe’s low, hard shot from the top of the right circle slipped past Hellebuyck at 17:36 for a 1-1 game. \nThen with the Moose working on third period power play, Dalpe grabbed a loose puck before breaking in on Hellebuyck and snapping a far-side shot under the cross bar with 7:01 left. Dalpe had 16 goals in 44 AHL games last season with the Rochester Americans. \n“I liked a lot of things in the game,” Hellebuyck said. “[There are] a lot of things I still need to work on. I didn’t like those two goals. Give them credit, but I think that mids-eason, I’m going to be stopping those every time.” \nBut McCambridge had plenty of compliments for his starting goaltender. \n“[Iowa] funnelled a lot of pucks to the net, a lot of shots coming in,” McCambridge said. “I thought he did a really good job controlling those rebounds, not letting them kick into those high-percentage scoring areas. I thought that Connor was exactly what we always want him to be. He had a really strong night.” \nThe Moose have a final week of practice to fine-tune their line-up and make final adjustments before heading to Toronto. Manitoba’s home schedule begins Oct. 15 at MTS Centre with a two-game series against the Ontario Reign. \n“I really enjoyed both games,” McCambridge said of the pre-season series. “A lot of the systems that were put into place, they really started to get a grasp of it [Saturday].” Sponsored Links Moose lose to Iowa Wild \nPATRICK WILLIAMS, FOR THE WINNIPEG SUN First posted: Sunday, October 04, 2015 12:43 PM CDT | Updated: Sunday, October 04, 2015 12:53 PM CDT \nFARGO, N.D. – Next time the games will count for real for the Manitoba Moose. \nThe Moose wrapped up their two-game pre-season series against the Iowa Wild with a 2-1 loss Saturday at Scheels Arena.
