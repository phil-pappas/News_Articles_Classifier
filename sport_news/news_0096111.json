The Rams set up their blocking pattern in that area and Seattle’s punt coverage unit, not bothering to locate the ball, followed them accordingly. \nThe only problem was the punt was actually headed toward the right side. It was fielded there by Stedman Bailey who, with an open field in front of him, raced 90 yards for a touchdown that proved the difference in St. Louis’ 28-26 win. \nThis type of punt decoy is football’s equivalent to baseball’s hidden-ball trick. It is used sparingly and doesn’t always succeed. But when it does, the victims look ridiculous. \nRecently, it’s been working with increasing frequency. Somewhat astonishingly, the punt-return decoy was pulled off successfully twice within an 18-hour span in high-profile Northwest games last weekend. \nUtah used it to score a touchdown in its stunning rout of Oregon on Saturday night at Eugene. Richard Sherman’s 60-yard return the following afternoon set up a field goal in the Seahawks’ 26-0 win over the Chicago Bears at CenturyLink Field. \nOne of two conclusions can be drawn from these incidents: \n1. Since many coverage teams are trained to follow the blockers rather than the ball, this ploy should almost always work. \n2. Or, since at least some members of the kicking team presumably should be following the direction of the punt, it should almost never work. \nMontesano High School coach Terry Jensen votes for the latter. \n“We teach (that) option, that you must locate the ball,” Jensen observed. “I am guessing, because the return team doesn’t know what direction the ball will be kicked, that if it is kicked to the return side then it is a normal return.” \nIn most cases, a team contemplating a punt decoy will tip its hand in at least one area. \nMost teams will send only one return man deep on punts. If a second safety materializes, there may be trickery afoot. \nSherman, however, disguised his intentions with an incredibly athletic play. According to those who witnessed the Seahawk game in person or via television (I was on the road and heard Seahawk radio play-by-play man Steve Raible also be be faked out by the return), the Seattle defensive back was jamming blockers at the line of scrimmage at the outset of the play, then sprinted downfield at full speed to take the kick over his shoulder. \nWhat isn’t clear is why more members of the kicking unit, even if they are not following the ball, aren’t aware of the punt’s location. Since college and professional punters are exceptionally accurate, it stands to reason that they would let their teammates know where the kick is headed. \n“You would think at that level and talent level, there would be a call as to where the punt would be kicked to,” Jensen said. \nThe increase in punt return decoys, Jensen agreed, might result in some changes in special teams coaching. \nOne piece of advice those coaches should dispense is that keeping your eye on the ball is a pretty good idea in any sport. \nRick Anderson: (360) 537-3926; randerson@thedailyworld.com Rules for posting comments \nComments posted below are from readers.
