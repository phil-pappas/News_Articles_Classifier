He went about his normal business on Tuesday.\nCoach Tom Coughlin said on a conference call with Philadelphia reporters that Beckham was day to day.\n\"The trainers seem to think he's made good progress. He wouldn't practice [Wednesday if there was one], no,\" Coughlin said. \"Hopefully we'll get some work in before the end of the week. ... All we can do is hold out with the fact that he is a very competitive young man and if it's at all possible, he'll be ready to play.\"\nThe Giants players had Wednesday off.\nThese are all positive signs for a player that missed all of the preseason, most of training camp and the first four games of the regular season last year with a hamstring injury. The Offensive Rookie of the Year also missed time this spring with a hamstring problem.\nThe Giants are already without wide receiver Victor Cruz . They can't afford to be without Beckham.\nBeckham injured his hamstring late in Sunday's 30-27 victory over the San Francisco 49ers. He missed most of the final two drives, although he did talk his way onto the field for part of the game-winning march and even drew a crucial pass interference penalty that set up the winning score.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:08:59.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
