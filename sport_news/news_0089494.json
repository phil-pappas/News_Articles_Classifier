Reports from England indicate that Sunderland have taken the Nigerian international striker, who is a free agent after having left Schalke at the end of last season, on trial. New Sunderland boss Allardyce famously brought Austin Okocha to Bolton in 2002 where the Nigerian thrived. Strong, quick and skillful Obasi has had a topsy-turvy career punctuated by unfortunate injuries since breaking into limelight in 2005 with Nigeria’s U-20s. The 29-year-old was one of the standout performers for Nigeria at the 2005 FIFA U-20 World Cup, starring alongside Mikel Obi and Taye Taiwo as they finished second to Lionel Messi’s Argentina. He also won silver at the 2008 Olympics with the Nigeria U-23s, another tournament in which Argentina defeated Nigeria in the final. Obasi also featured for the Super Eagles at the Africa Cup of Nations in 2010, the same year he played at the World Cup. At club level, Obasi played for Lyn Oslo after the U-20 World Cup, then went on to star for Hoffenheim for five years before joining Schalke in 2012.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:41:59.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
