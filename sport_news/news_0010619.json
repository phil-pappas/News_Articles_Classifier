(Nuccio DiNuzzo/Chicago Tribune/TNS) \nPITTSBURGH — Jake Arrieta pitched the Cubs to their first postseason victory in 12 years Wednesday night, a 4-0 shutout of the Pirates in the National League wild-card game at PNC Park. The Cubs advance to the best-of-five NLDS to face the Cardinals, starting Friday in St. Louis. \nArrieta, who had three shutouts in the regular season, allowed four hits and struck out 11. With the bases loaded in the sixth, he prompted Starling Marte to ground into a double play to end the inning and also benefited from a double play to end the seventh. \nRookie Kyle Schwarber drove in the Cubs’ first three runs, including a two-run homer off Pirates right-hander Gerrit Cole in the third inning. Schwarber’s single to left field in the first inning drove in Dexter Fowler for an early 1-0 lead. \nFowler was 3-for-4 with three runs scored and a fifth-inning solo homer off Cole, who pitched five innings. \nThe benches cleared in the seventh inning when Pirates reliever Tony Watson hit Arrieta with a pitch on the hip. Arrieta had hit a Pirates player with a pitch in the fifth and sixth innings. The Pirates’ Sean Rodriguez was ejected following the altercation, which didn’t appear to escalate much beyond pushing and yelling.
