Another fierce competition between Smith and Dixon emerged in an unlikely place.\n“Even in the cafeteria eating food, we had to see who could get the most plates,” said Smith, who also spilled some of the guidelines. “There was a minimum of four plates. You had to try to get more than that.”\nDixon finished his eligibility last season, but Smith, now a junior, remains hungry to lead the Tigers defense without his friend who spent two seasons almost always by his side, literally and figuratively, in the lunch room and at middle linebacker.\n“(Smith) might be one of the most underrated linebackers in America,” SSU coach Earnest Wilson said. “He can play on the line of scrimmage or play in the middle. He has great instincts and his speed and long arms help him cover a lot of distance.”\nAt 6-foot-3 and 235 pounds, Smith has the size to play inside linebacker in the Tigers’ 3-4 defensive scheme.\nBut Wilson said 4.6 40-yard dash speed makes Smith more valuable as a dual threat — coming off the edge as a pass rusher or dropping back into pass coverage.\nSmith leads SSU with 37 tackles and five tackles for losses this season. He’s been particularly productive in Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference play, registering 32 tackles in four league games.\nLast Saturday against North Carolina Central, he had a team-leading 10 tackles, a tackle for loss, an interception and brought down an Eagle kickoff returner in the end zone for a safety.\nEarlier in the season, Smith blocked a punt that was returned for a touchdown against Akron.\n“Marquis makes a lot of big plays,” Tigers linebacker coach Tony Pierce said. “He’s one of our high-motor guys. He’s rangy with his height and arms and he can run. On defense, you’re always looking for guys with (good speed) because we have to run people down.”\nPossibly because the SSU defense has struggled, Smith’s play often goes under the radar. He was voted only third-team all-conference in the preseason despite hovering among the nation’s leaders in tackles for losses (17 in eight games) before suffering a knee injury last season.\nAs a freshman, he registered 124 tackles — winning his bragging battle with Dixon by two — and ranked 11th in the Football Championship Subdivision and third in the MEAC.\nIt was the second-best mark in school history, runner-up only to Tim Rawls’ 136 stops in 1996.\nBut then came the knee injury against South Carolina State, when an opponent hit him from behind on a play away from the ball.\n“I tore the MCL, tore some other ligaments in there and had a bone fracture,” Smith said. “There were times I got down about it, but I just did what I had to do in rehab so I could play this season. I wanted to do whatever I had to, to help this team.”\nSmith, who is majoring in mass communication with a minor in homeland security, continues to play a big role despite not drawing much attention.\n“He’s a quiet leader,” Pierce said. “He’s not going to give you 1,000 words. He’s going to answer you straight and directly on the field, and off the field he’s going to do the right things.”\nMore than midway through his third season, Smith has played in just two wins for Savannah State. One came just three weeks ago against Florida A&M.\nThe Tigers have lost two straight since the victory and have a bye this week before returning to action against Howard on Oct. 31.\nIt’s a perfect time to refocus on fundamentals, Smith said.\nAnd a perfect time to adjust attitudes.\n“We have to learn to finish,” he said.\nThe numbers back up his statement. SSU has cumulatively outscored its first four MEAC opponents 58-50 in the first half this season, but it has been outscored 100-16 in the second half.\n“There’s definitely progress here. That’s not the question,” Smith said. “We just have to fight harder in the second half. We have to dig deep inside and address it. We’ve got four games left, and the most important thing is to get some more wins.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14827778.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14827316.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14827316.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14827778.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T13:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:41:44.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
