O'Connor Herald News Staff Reporter Posted Oct. 16, 2015 at 7:30 AM FALL RIVER — The Chamber of Commerce has a pitch for the PawSox: Come across the Braga Bridge. We will make you feel at home. “We have started poking around, to see if there is an interest in bringing the Pawtucket Red Sox to Fall River,” said Robert Mellion, president and CEO of the Fall River Area chamber. “This is a job for the Chamber, to see if there is an interest and to talk to people to see where the interest might lead.” The PawSox, the Boston Red Sox Triple-A farm league team, is located in McCoy Stadium in the center of Pawtucket’s densely populated Darlington neighborhood. New team owners want to move the team to a new stadium. Their idea for a Providence stadium fell flat, so now a lot of cities are in the hunt. The Worcester chamber began talks with the PawSox a month ago, Mellion said it is time for Fall River to step up to the plate. “I had a conversation with the chamber chairman last night,” Mellion said on Thursday. “We’ll discuss it at the chamber board meeting later this month. I’ll be talking to the local legislative delegation about it, too. Mellion said the chamber wants to create a buzz and get the conversation rolling. Rick Medeiros, an executive with the PawSox, was in the area Wednesday to introduce former Red Sox pitcher Bill Lee to chamber members at a lunch at Whites of Westport. Lee was enthusiastic about a Fall River stadium. “You have easy access to the highway, you have space for parking, and you have a waterfront,” Lee said. “Plus Route 24 is a lot quicker to Fenway than Route 95.” Those are points the chamber will be selling, Mellion said. “There are waterfront locations that can be available,” Mellion said. “The question is if there is interest. This is something that should be explored.” This is not the first time Fall River has made a pitch for the team. A Fall River delegation met with Red Sox officials in 1997 to sell them on 30 acres in the industrial park for a stadium. “My understanding is that they were really close,” Mellion said. “At the last minute, the Rhode Island legislature appropriated $10 million to improve the stadium in Pawtucket.” What came of that effort were market studies by the Red Sox that showed a big influx from Fall River, Somerset and Swansea for every PawSox game, Mellion said. An initial survey turned up several sites that would meet the needs of a modern stadium. There are sites on the city waterfront and in the South End, Mellion said.

I’ve had preliminary discussions with a development team to put together a proposal to bring to the PawSox and the Red Sox.” “This would be huge for Fall River,” Mellion said. “What does Fall River not have? We don’t have a venue to bring people to Fall River. People come to Fall River to work. We don’t even have a movie theater.” The city’s biggest draw is The Narrows Center for the Arts, Mellion said. “People know about the Narrows,” he said. “People from Providence, Easton, Newport go to the Narrows, so we know they will come to Fall River.” The effort, Mellion said, is in its infancy. “We are looking to create a dialogue,” he said. “We have the waterfront, we have the highway, we have the fans. “It belongs here.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:32:05.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
