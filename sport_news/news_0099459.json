Advertisement \nThe Lady Falcons got a huge win Tuesday night against District 23-4A opponent Splendora via a sweep, 25-17, 25-22, and 25-16. \nWith the victory, Huffman moves to 22-8 overall and 8-1 in district, while the Ladycats fall to 23-12, and 5-4 respectively. \n“The thought going into today was just play our game and stay aggressive,” said Huffman coach Kelly Smalley. “They really were able to execute on those things that we talked about.” \nIn the early stages of the match, it was Splendora that came out aggressive, getting out to a 3-0 lead in the first set before the Lady Falcons had time to get on the court. But Huffman’s side battled back to tie the set up at 10-10 before taking its first lead at 14-13. \nThe girls continued to push the Ladycat defense to the brink before opening up an 8-point lead and finishing off the set 25-17. \nNeither side gave ground in the second set, battling back-and-forth after Splendora again got off to a 3-0 start. The teams were tied as late as 20-20 before Huffman went on a 5-2 run to seal the 2-0 lead behind some strong play by the Lady Falcon offense. \nIt was Huffman that got off to the 3-0 start in the third set, but this time the lead held. Splendora had trouble throughout the final frame countering the service of the Lady Falcons en route to a 17-9 deficit midway through, and Huffman would go on to end the match 25-16. \nSplendora was led by Zoe Osteen's seven kills, and Karoline Jones's nine assists. Huffman got eight kills from Ryan Drevnkar, 11 assists from Cameron Taylor, and eight digs from Monica Shelton. \nAfter the match, Splendora coach David Wooldridge acknowledged the playoff feel to the match, saying his side needed a game like this to prepare for the postseason. \n“(Huffman’s) really good, and they’re really well coached; that’s why they’re in the top spot in our district,” he said. “Our kids are learning to win. They’ve had some success, and they’re learning how to beat the upper echelon teams, and how to play with them. \n“What I saw was a group that played their rear ends off tonight. They played hard. We just made some mental mistakes at the wrong time.” \nAs the regular season winds down, Huffman will inch closer to clinching the top overall spot in District 23-4A if it gets a win at Shepherd this Friday, while Splendora will look to bounce back with another home match on Friday against Cleveland.
