(AP) - Lamar Jackson ran for a short touchdown and passed for 230 yards, and Louisville's defense made a big stand late to preserve a 17-14 victory over Boston College on Saturday. \nBoston College had a final chance after recovering a fumble at midfield with 2:18 remaining, but the Eagles turned it over on downs when Troy Flutie was sacked for a 4-yard loss. The play capped a dominant defensive effort for Louisville (3-4, 2-2 Atlantic Coast Conference), which recorded eight sacks, held BC to minus-14 yards rushing and just 79 overall. \nLouisville tied for the eighth-lowest yardage allowed since 1962. \nThe Eagles (3-5, 0-5) forced four turnovers, including Elijah Robinson's 12-yard touchdown return of a blocked punt and a fumble return setting up another TD. They also posted seven sacks and held the Cardinals scoreless in the second half, but couldn't take advantage on a cool, soggy day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:05:04.446+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
