The question Sunday night was, could his condition improve enough in the 17 hours between the end of Game 2 and the start of Game 3 of the American League Division Series against Toronto to be in the starting lineup? \n“We’ll check in with Adrian tomorrow,” Banister said. “We feel like if Adrian comes in and says he’s ready to go, then he’s ready to go.\" \nBeltre missed games two and three of the ALDS with stiffness in his lower back. He left game one moments after hitting an RBI single. \nThe star third baseman was reportedly swinging a bat in the tunnel during Game 2 in Toronto -- a 14-inning affair -- but he didn’t make an appearance. \nHanser Alberto has gone 2-for-8 starting in Beltre’s place. He hit the go-ahead, two-RBI single in the 14th inning of Game 2 Friday afternoon in Toronto.
