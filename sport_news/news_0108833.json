(Photo: MADDY JONES) \nSWANNANOA - By design, the Asheville High boys were perfect on Monday. \nNoah Shore (16 minutes, 24.90 seconds), Davis Turner (16:28.40), Terry Young (16:41.40), Haven Honeycutt (16:42.20) and Collin Kemper (16:46.90) were the first-five runners to reach the finish chute at the Mountain Athletic Conference cross country meet. \nAnd since only five athletes count towards a team score, that meant the Cougars could not have done any better than their conference-record 15 points on a picturesque autumn day at Asheville Christian Academy. \nRoberson was the runner-up boys team with 55 points. The Rams (38 points) won the girls meet, followed closely by Reynolds (40). \n\"I was a little worried about this meet, I've been sick for the last three weeks,\" said Shore, who is a senior for the Cougars. \n\"It's a good feeling to win the way we did. We have a good team that keeps getting better.\" \n\"This team has been setting goals,\" Asheville coach Chris Stroup added. \n\"(A perfect score at the MAC meet) was one of them. We discussed it. No one can ever overtake or beat a perfect score. We had some personal records today from a number of guys. It was a good day for us.\" \nSince the MAC officially recognizes a 3-A and 4-A champion in every team sport, Roberson won the larger classification with the following runners placing in the top-10, individually â€“ Sean McDowell (sixth place, 17:01.90), Philip Schechtman (seventh, 17:10.40) and Michael Zapherson (eighth, 17:11.00). \nAsheville was a repeat overall champion in boys as was Roberson in girls. \nScoring runners for the Rams were runner-up Ashlyn Blakely (19:17.10), Chesley Krug (fourth place, 19:33.80), Camille Long (seventh, 20:26.50), Iris Howell (12th, 20:57.00) and Devin Hickman (13th, 21:01.20). \nIndividual champ Anna Vess from Reynolds (17:52.40) broke away in the race's opening mile. The Rockets harrier has dominated all local meets as a senior and will presumably get a chance to defend her 3-A state championship on Nov. 7. \n\"I'm excited about it,\" Vess said. \n\"I felt pretty good today, I felt strong.\" \nSamantha Boeshore (third place, 19:27.70), Emma Himelein-Wachowiak (fifth, 19:46.70) and Sophie Pruett (ninth, 20:44.60) also placed in the top-10 for the MAC 3-A champion Rockets. \nMountain Athletic Conference meetMonday at Asheville Christian Academy, SwannanoaBOYSTeam scores 1.
