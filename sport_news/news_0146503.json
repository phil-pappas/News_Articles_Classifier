Kiya Townsend scored the winning try in injury time. (KAYLA BAUCHE) \nThe Brandon Barbarians are getting a reputation of being cardiac kids when it comes to Rugby Manitoba women’s championship games. \nLast year, the Barbarians scored the game-winning try with seven minutes left to claim its second-ever league title. This year, they waited for the last play to score the game-winning try and repeat as champions. \nWith time winding down in Saturday’s game in Winnipeg, the Barbarians worked their way forward from a ruck 10 yards out and Kiya Townsend finally broke through to touch the ball down in the goal to give Brandon a 40-36 lead over the Wasps. After the convert was missed, the final whistle blew to give the team the victory. \n\"Nothing like keeping it to the last minute,\" said Barbarians manager and coach Amy Higgins. \"Oh my god yes (it was nerveracking). It’s like my shattered nerves. \n\"As soon as he put his hand up and blew that hard whistle all bets were off. We didn’t know for sure if it was the last play, but I asked the assistant ref and he said we were in injury time so it could be whenever.\" \nIt’s the second straight year Townsend has scored the winning try in the final. \nSaturday’s game didn’t begin like it would have a happy finish for the Barbarians. They gave up two early tries and trailed 17-0 and 24-7 before the players woke up. \nBrandon improved its communication, played much better and cut the lead to three by the half, although a lot of the players didn’t realize they were that close. \n\"At half a few of us asked what the score was and I didn’t tell many girls because we thought we were down by quite a bit,\" said Amy Tuttosi, one of the Barbarian captains. \"It was a matter of scoring more to make sure we could secure the win. We didn’t tell many people what the score was so we were trying that much harder for it.\" \nJamee George celebrated her recent engagement by scoring two tries. Amy Lee added two others while Kristy McKay supplied one. It was the first try McKay has scored in 10 years of playing rugby at various levels. \nSteph Dornn added five conversions. \nDefending their championship meant a lot to the team, especially with the roster turnover this season and the struggle the Barbarians have in September and October every season. Brandon loses some players to their university teams every year, which often leaves the Barbarians struggling to find substitutes to play. \nThat makes deciding when to make a change on the pitch a lot more strategic. \nHowever, the team, which topped the regular season with a 10-2 record before beating the Brumbies/University of Manitoba Wombats 41-5 in the semifinals, came together when it mattered most and got the job done. Tuttosi was proud of her teammates for the way they played all season. \n\"From a personal perspective, this is huge for us,\" she said. \"I’m so proud of our team and how much we’ve built ourselves up this year. We had a lot of rookies come in this year, but the rookies really proved themselves and were a huge part of our team. We bound together so well, it’s more like a family than a team.\" \n» cjaster@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:40:32.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
