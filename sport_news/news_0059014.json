It was a game against their fiercest rivals that they dominated at times and lost on very small margins. They could easily have won. \n\"England have to feel the hurt and pain from that loss, have it simmering in the background, but keep it under control. It cannot envelop you. \n\"The knockout stages have come a week or two early for England, but they have to live in the here and now.\" \nEngland face Australia at Twickenham later today.
