But it doesn't hurt to be cautious when going out trick-or-treating.\nEvery year there are warnings about harmful items being put in kids' candy bags. There have been news reports of people's claims, including one of razor blades in candy, cannabis-laced gummy bears and candy-coated laxatives.\nOther stories of objects found in candy include shards of glass , nails , needles , pins and staples .\nIn September, a Facebook post warning parents about fun-packaged ecstasy pills was circulating the web.\nSome ecstasy pills are brightly-colored with deceiving symbols such as a Superman logo, dominoes and the word Nintendo written across them. These pills may look appealing, but they are deadly, the post alleges.\nMany of these warnings are no more than rumor, but be wary of anything that doesn't come in factory packaging or looks like it has been opened.\nFor more information on candy inspections and what to be aware of this Halloween, check with police, fire departments or hospitals in your area.\nCopyright 2015 Raycom News Network.
