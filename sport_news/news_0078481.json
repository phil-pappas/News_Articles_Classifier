Birney Crum Stadium. \nThe Vikings (4-2, 3-2 EPC) led 28-0 with less than 10 minutes elapsed in the game. Nazareth (4-2, 3-2) fought back after that but was crippled by four turnovers and an inability to score in the red zone. \nTurning point : Nazareth, trailing 14-0, had driven deep into Central Catholic territory in the first half but was stopped by an interception by Thomas Murphy at the Viking 17, which he returned to the 31. On the next play junior Darnell Ferrell took a speed sweep 69 yards for a Central Catholic TD and a 21-0 lead, and the Vikings never looked back. \nTop performer : Central Catholic senior running back Alvin Pacheco piled up 234 yards and four touchdowns of 60, 43, 27 and 21 yards on 21 carries. He was unstoppable. He also threw the lead block on Ferrell’s big run. \nWhat it means: Central Catholic laid down a marker: anybody with ideas of advancing past them to win District 11 Class AAA will be in for a major tussle, and they are not out of contention in the EPC South. For Nazareth, a day to forget and move on, one of those all-around stinkers that happen sometimes. But the Blue Eagles needed to address ball security and run defense. \nBrad Wilson may be reached at bwilson@lehighvalleylive.com . Follow him on Twitter @bradwsports.
