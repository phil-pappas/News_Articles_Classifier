Many in the community have said they were angered by his pro-gun-control remarks hours after the shooting at Umpqua Community College.\n\"I've got some very strong feelings about this, because when you talk to these families, you're reminded that this could be happening to your child, or your mom, or your dad, or your relative or your friend,\" Obama somberly told reporters after meeting with survivors at Roseburg High School. \"And so we're going to have to come together as a country to see how we can prevent these issues from taking place. \"\nHowever, the president added, \"Today it's about the families and their grief, and the love we feel for them. And they surely do appreciate all the support that they've received.\"\nOne woman, leaving the high school after meeting the president, refused to stop for an interview. But she said emphatically, \"It wasn't a discussion, it was a hug.\"\nShe was likely referring to the noisy discussion taking place at the airport – where he helicoptered in from Eugene – and outside the high school, where most of the demonstrators made it clear that they didn't welcome him to Roseburg.\n\"Just by being here, he politicizes\" the shooting deaths, said Chuck Cooper, a retired homebuilder from Oakland, Oregon, arguing that the president's goal was not to console victims but to build support for new restrictions on guns.\nA large banner, \"Obama Go Home,\" was hung at the entrance to the airport, and signs berated his stands on guns while others praised the local sheriff, John Hanlin, for his past insistence that he wouldn't enforce gun restrictions he regarded as unconstitutional.\nPresident Obama arrives in Roseburg President Obama arrived by helicopter at Roseburg airport on Friday afternoon.\nAt one point, a truck raced past the airport crowd as a young man leaned out the window joyfully waving a Confederate flag.\nOthers welcomed the president, albeit in seemingly smaller numbers. About a dozen people who said they were past or present students at the community college waved signs in front of the high school welcoming Obama.\n\"We're about peace and love, nothing political,\" said Sara Garcia, an unemployed Roseburg resident who said she attended the school in 2012.\nInside the high school, the president gave plenty of embraces, passed out commemorative presidential coins and had a particularly emotional exchange with Mathew Downing. He's the 18-year-old Umpqua student who was in the classroom where the shootings occurred but was not fired on after the gunman gave him a package and told him to give it to the police.\nGov. Kate Brown, who accompanied Obama to the high school, said the president told Downing, \"You're here for a reason and don't forget that.\"\nShe said the exchange was so moving she had to turn away. \"I had to give them a moment of privacy,\" the governor said.\nObama supporter hopes to represent 'silent majority' Dulcie Bagley, a resident of Roseburg, shows her support for President Obama.\nBrown said she came away convinced that the survivors who attended the meeting felt that Obama's visit was valuable.\n\"The individuals he spoke to were so comforted by him and so grateful he was present,\" said Brown.\nShe said Obama also met with several first-responders and administrators at Umpqua Community College. Among them, according to one Roseburg High staffer, were the two Roseburg police detectives, Joe Kaney and Todd Spingath , who exchanged shots with the gunman and who are credited with hastening the end of his shooting spree.\n\"It was about the families,\" Roseburg High Principal Jill Weber said after the meeting. \"That was what it was about.\"\nProtesters await President Obama's arrival at Roseburg airport Protesters lined Aviation Drive near the Roseburg airport in anticipation of President Obama's arrival Friday morning. Some said they felt the president is politicizing last week's shooting to support a gun control agenda, interfering with the community's grieving process.\nObama, beginning a four-day West Coast trip, flew to Eugene on Air Force One and ferried Oregon Sens. Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, and Rep. Peter DeFazio, all Democrats. The three lawmakers visited emergency personnel who helped treat the victims at PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center in Springfield.\nObama flew by helicopter to Roseburg for a two-hour visit that brought an unusual crush of security to this longtime logging town. Among them: a contingent of about two dozen emergency-response officers from the Portland Police Bureau.\nBrown met the president in Roseburg and said she talked to him about providing further aid to Umpqua Community College to help it return to normalcy. Beth Schoenbach, an aide to DeFazio, said he talked with Obama about ensuring that the college won't lose the ability to provide federally backed financial aid to students.\nRoseburg Mayor Larry Rich, who joined Roseburg City Council members in issuing a statement of welcome for the president following reports earlier this week that many residents didn't want him to visit, joined the president for the private meeting.\nBut Rich declined to talk afterward, saying, \"It's too emotional.\"\n-- Jeff Mapes\njmapes@oregonian.com\n503-221-8209\n@Jeffmapes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:13:09.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
