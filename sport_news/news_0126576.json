Comment   staff reports Posted Oct. 7, 2015 at 7:19 PM By staff reports Posted Oct. 7, 2015 at 7:19 PM Neosho youth football teams battled Webb City on Saturday, winning five of eight games. THIRD GRADE Neosho Black 42, Webb City Red 0 It was the perfect storm for Black on Saturday: offensively, defensively and on special teams. Offensively, Black ran for 470 yards on 36 carries. Defensively, Black denied Red a single first down all day. On special teams, Logan Decker recovered two onside kicks. Cade Spiva rushed for 215 yards and three TDs on 12 carries, with three runs of at least 30 yards highlighted by a long of 58 on his first carry. Decker rushed for 108 yards and three more scores on nine carries, his day highlighted by a long run of 45 yards. Bostyn Patterson and Hudson Williams added a combined 137 yards on 11 carries, with Patterson good for 70 yards and one conversion run on five carries and Williams 67 yards and two conversion runs on six carries. Black notched its five shutout win of the season. No. 99 Dalton Kesinger and No. 44 Lance Kesinger led the standout Black defense with seven tackles each. Decker added five stops, while Patterson and Spiva each had four, Williams and Daniel Molina each with three, Denver Welch, Finn Versluis, Levi England and Cyres Ludiker two each and Logan Cass and Camp Ramsey one each. Black leads the South Division with a perfect 6-0 record, outscoring its opponents by a dominating 224-14 this season. Seneca, the team that scored all 14 points against Neosho, stands at second at 5-1. Neosho Gold 14, Webb City White 0 Grant Landers and Kanton Smith scored the lone touchdowns and Jayden Nichols added a two-point conversion for Gold. Kaden Edwards led Gold with 56 yards on three carries, highlighted by a long run of 46 yards.

Smith and Edwards connected on a 5-yard pass. Brodie Arthur and Hunter Butler each made six tackles, while Smith and Edwards each had three. Noah Durman recovered three fumbles and Edwards added one. Gold stands in a second-place tie with Lamar at 5-1 and at 2:30 p.m. Saturday, the teams square off at Bob Anderson Stadium. FOURTH GRADE Webb City Red 60, Neosho Black 12 No details were provided. Webb City White 14, Neosho Gold 6 Aiden Brodie managed the only touchdown for Gold and it was an important one for the young man. Brodie scored his touchdown for his mother, who had breast cancer surgery in St. Louis two days before the game. Brodie's TD highlighted a day in which he rushed for 78 yards on 13 carries. Page 2 of 3 - Ryken Shallenburger added 28 yards on seven carries and four tackles on the defensive side. Jonah Reed tallied 16 yards on four carries and three tackles. Jonathan Chrisco led the defense with seven tackles. The North Division includes two teams at both extremes — Joplin Red 6-0, Webb City 0-6 — and then six teams separated by two games: Carthage White 4-2, Webb City White 3-3, Lamar 3-3, Monett 3-3, Carl Junction Red 3-3 and Neosho Gold 2-4. FIFTH GRADE Neosho Black 44, Webb City Red 6 Jeremiah Cobb, Dante Washington, Jared Siler, Connor Ackerson and Dillon Surratt all scored rushing touchdowns for Black. Cobb rushed for 113 yards and two scores on eight carries, averaging 14.1 yards per carry and one touchdown every four times he carried the ball. Washington gained 92 yards on eight carries, with all eight carries worth at least five yards. Talk about consistency with gains of 11, 7, 5, 16, 10, 12, 19 and 12. Washington found the end zone once. Siler tallied 39 yards and one TD on four carries, highlighted by a long run of 25. Ackerson scored a 12-yard TD run and Surratt a 5-yard TD run on their only carries of the game. Mitchell Sandlin added 28 yards on seven carries and Isaac Whitehill three yards on two carries. Washington completed 2 of 5 passes for 37 yards and an interception. Surratt caught one pass for 23 yards and Cobb added the other 14 yards on the other completed pass.

Ackerson led the defense with 5 1/2 tackles, while Sandlin added 4 1/2 and Washington four. Neosho Black's only loss this season came against Carthage Black, 30-0. However, Carthage Black outscored its first six opponents 167-0. Black stands a game ahead of Seneca and McDonald County, this week's opponent, in the South Division. Neosho Gold 30, Webb City White 6 Gold tasted victory for the first time this season and no doubt a 24-point victory over a Webb City team tasted sweet. Austin Rodriguez led Neosho with a pair of touchdown passes and one rushing touchdown, while Bryce Willis rushed for over 100 yards and scored two TDs, one rushing and one receiving. Rodriguez completed 4 of his 8 passes for 40 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. He rushed for 30 yards and one TD, as well as one conversion, on eight carries. Willis gained 117 yards on 11 carries, his longest gains of 35 and 42 yards, respectively, coming on his final two carries. Brock Franklin rushed for 76 yards on 10 carries. Additionally, Kael Smith caught two passes for 28 yards and a touchdown, plus he caught a conversion pass. Page 3 of 3 - Willis caught a conversion pass. Brandon Cargile proved to be a force defensively, between his team-high five tackles and his three fumble recoveries. Robert Beltran, Jason Tice and Willis each made four stops. Beltran and Franklin added interceptions. SIXTH GRADE Neosho Black 30, Webb City Red 20 Logan Whetzell's big day on the ground propelled Black to victory. Whetzell gained 191 yards and scored three touchdowns on 15 carries, averaging 12.7 yards per carry and scoring one TD every five carries. His three longest runs of 59, 43 and 47 yards gave him 149 of his 191 yards. Hayden Crane rushed for 32 yards and one TD on 10 carries, with Nathan Xiong and Tristan Clanton adding 24 and 23 yards, respectively. Xiong scored on a pair of conversion runs and Clanton added one. On the defensive side, Marcus Duncan led with six tackles, while Whetzell added five, Crane four and Talon Mitchell, Elijah Mojica, Clanton, Xiong and Seth Green three each. Clanton added a fumble recovery. Black's win moved them into a three-way tie at 3-3 with Webb City Red and East Newton. Black takes on 5-1 McDonald County this week. Webb City White 16, Neosho Gold 8 Trent Neece's effort proved not to be enough for Gold against White. Neece rushed for a team-high 67 yards on a team-high 17 carries and scored Gold's lone touchdown on a 7-yard run. He added the conversion run. Evan Haskins added 41 yards on nine carries and Tristen Mason eight yards on nine carries. Gold had 107 rushing yards on 36 carries, averaging nearly three yards.
