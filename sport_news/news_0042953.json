Beckman, who won his previous championship in 2012, was in a two-year winless slump until being paired with crew chief Jimmy Prock and crew.\n“When qualifying got shortened because of the weather to one session, I thought that the national record was going to be off the table,” Beckman said during a Wednesday teleconference with the media. “I don't know that I could have hoped for the outcome that we got where we actually made up 103 points, which is slightly more than five rounds, on Del, and I think it just basically put us right back in the championship.”\nNow with three races left – the Texas Fall Nationals (Oct. 15-18), the Toyota Nationals in Las Vegas (Oct. 29-Nov. 1) and the Auto Club Finals in Pomona (Nov. 12-15) – Beckman is right back where he wants to be, closing in on another world championship.\nHOEFER HAS CAREER WEEKEND CW Hoefer of Calimesa used strategy and guile to outrace best friend Jack Swanson of Yucaipa to win the in the Sportsman Class final at last Sunday’s Summit Showdown, capping Hoefer’s career-best weekend of racing during the two-day NHRA Summit Racing Series Pacific Division Finals weekend at Auto Club Dragway in Fontana.\nHoefer, along with class winners Brian Fritz (Super Pro), Tony Marconi (Pro ET), Don Caesar (Motorcycle) and Phil Watkins (Pro ET) move on to race at the NHRA National Championship next month during the NHRA Finals weekend at Auto Club Raceway in Pomona.\nHoefer and the others will face off with winners from the six other NHRA Divisions at Pomona next month.\n“This is by far the best weekend I’ve ever had in racing,” said Hoefer, who has lost out twice trying to get to Pomona. “I’ve been at this for 14 years and this is my first trip to the Nationals.”\nHoefer faced off with Swanson in the Sportsman final of Sunday’s Summit Showdown. Swanson took the early lead but ran too fast, giving Hoefer the win. Hoefer clocked in at 7.683 seconds at 83 miles per hour in his ’91 Firebird. Swanson went 7.896 on his 7.93 dial-in.\nOn Saturday, the Division 7 team from Auto Club Dragway won the team championship.\nHoefer, along with Brian Fritz, Tony Marconi, Don Caesar and Phil Watkins will all advance to the national championship where they will face off with winners from the six other NHRA Divisions across the country. All Summit Division Champions competing in Pomona will receive $3,000 from Summit Racing Equipment and will be competing for an additional $5,000 winner-take-all in each of the four classes.\nWatkins, of Tucson, Ariz., led the list of winners from Saturday’s action along with Rialto’s Ryan Mangus, who led the Auto Club Dragway team to the team championship.\nWatkins, who defeated Hoefer, took the win in Pro and will advance to the national championship via the wild card as the NHRA Pacific Division was drawn for the Pro Class earlier this year. Watkins used a holeshot to run down Hoefer, who was pulling double duty this weekend, driving in both the Sportsman and the Pro classes.\nMangus went seven rounds in Sportsman, defeating Nick Marconi in the final. His win helped lead the Auto Club Dragway team to the team championship by more than 20 points. Auto Club Dragway (84 points) defeated Auto Club Famoso Raceway of Bakerfield (60 points) and Sonoma Raceway (55).\nGET STRAIGHT RHYTHM THIS WEEKEND Touted as the evolution of the sport of motocross, Red Bull Straight Rhythm is a competition that pits 24 of the top riders in the world in head-to-head, best-of-three racing on an “unwound” track (no turns) on the former horse racetrack at Pomona Fairplex, Friday and Saturday in Pomona.\nThe biggest names – Ryan Dungey, James Stewart, Ken Roczen, Marvin Musquin – will battle on a half-mile, straight rhythm section, which features 75 jumps and over 400 feet of whoops.\nFor more information go to www.redbull.com/straightrhythm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:24:21.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
