He never won a Super Bowl while serving as head coach of the Green Bay Packers (1988-91) or Indianapolis Colts (1996-97), but left behind a legacy of goodwill and kindness to those who knew him. \n“They kept saying to me, ‘We just wanted to tell you that [Lindy] was special,’ ” Stephanie said in a phone interview. “It’s just been one call after another. Cowher said he knew whenever he ran into Lindy, he’d get some kind of wit coming out of his mouth. He always cracked a joke, [Cowher] said he never knew what was coming.” \nWhat Butler remembers most about Infante was an incident during his Packers’ 1990 rookie season. Infante caught him smiling at the end of a preseason practice, which didn’t go particularly well, and unloaded on the ex-Florida State safety in front of the team. \nSlideshow: Longtime coach Lindy Infante dies at 75 \nButler was told by Infante to leave the practice field, saying “Just get out of here, you’re not taking this [practice] serious.” A mortified Butler was so shaken, he called former FSU coach Bobby Bowden to discuss the blowup. \n“I told Coach Bowden I didn’t do anything wrong, I’m just a happy guy that always smiles,” said Butler. “Coach Bowden told me not to take it personally. But at the time, my feelings were hurt.” \nA couple days later, as the Packers were getting off the bus in Milwaukee to play a preseason game, Infante waited for Butler to convey his regret for the practice outburst. \n“He looked right at me and said, ‘I’m sorry, I overreacted. Everybody tells me this is your [outgoing] personality. I apologize and I love you,’ “ Butler said. “I almost had tears in my eyes. He told he didn’t want me to carry that [incident] on to the field. The rest of my career, I never forgot that. \n“Most coaches wouldn’t do that, especially to a rookie. It put [Infante] in a different place in my heart. He didn’t just care about football, he cared about you.” \nSeveral Infante work colleagues and ex-players that I spoke with, including South Carolina coach Steve Spurrier, only briefly mentioned football when asked about their memories of Infante. Though he was considered a masterful offensive mind — directing the Cincinnati Bengals and Cleveland Browns to the AFC Championship game as their coordinator in the 1980s — those who knew him focused more on his friendly disposition than his football accomplishments. \n“Lindy was a guy you were always comfortable around, one of the nicest people I’ve ever worked for,” said Glenn Greenspan, the former public relations director for the Bulls, now working in the same capacity for Tiger Woods. \nSpurrier, who owns a Crescent Beach home near Infante, acknowledged Infante was “a very good coach in his day” and remembers the ex-Florida halfback scoring a touchdown in 1960 to help defeat Georgia Tech 18-17. But what stuck out to him was how much Infante enjoyed retirement with his family and had every beach toy imaginable, including a para-glider he often saw him using. \n“Lindy was a good person, and he loved life,” said Spurrier. \nUnfortunately, Infante wasn’t so fortunate in eight years as a pro head coach. Except for 1989, when he was NFL Coach of the Year in Green Bay, he struggled with either an injury-ravaged team (1984 Bulls finished 6-12) or not having a franchise-type quarterback. \nIn a 2010 interview with the Times-Union, he kiddingly called himself “The Before Coach” because he was fired by the Packers two months before they traded for Brett Favre, then fired by the Colts three months before they drafted Peyton Manning. \n“My career might have taken on 15 more years of longevity had either one of those worked out,” Infante said. \nStephanie, who celebrated 50 years of marriage to Lindy in June, considered how different their lives might have been if her husband coached Favre or Manning. Looking back, she’s fine with the tradeoff. \n“Do I wish he had a chance with those quarterbacks? Yes,” said Stephanie. “But do I regret having him retired early [at age 57] and we got to do a lot of things together? No.” \nIn the end, football was a big part of Lindy Infante’s life, but it didn’t define him. Those who knew and loved him understood you don’t need championship rings to be a champion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:45:39.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
