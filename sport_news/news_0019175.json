This week, we had to do the digging instead. Hanneman didn’t just have a bad week in his picks, he had a historically bad week. To put it in perspective, his performance was like saying the Titanic was involved in a fender-bender. It was not a banner week by either one of our fearless forecasters. Jamie Baker, at least, posted a respectable 12-6 record. He correctly picked the winner in the two games he and Hanneman disagreed on, upped his season total to 75-19 and expanded his lead over Hanneman to seven games. Hanneman limped, staggered, stumbled and bumbled his way to a 10-8 record. That’s what got us digging. We couldn’t remember the grizzled veteran, who’s been picking area games for 30-plus seasons, ever having such a bad week. We did find a couple of Week One 9-6 records some years back. But 10-8? We had to go back to 1992 and an 8-9 record in Week Eight of that season to find worse. Hanneman has been trying to rationalize his first-to-worst fall in the Pigskin Picks on his new favorite word: “parity.”“Check out Joe Eitel sometime,” he said the other night, wildly waving his arms and looking just a tad deranged. “Every school in Region 23 has at least one loss. Every single one. Only two teams in Region 24 are still undefeated and only two in Region 20. And we’re only halfway through the regular season!“It just goes to show that with these new fangled spread offenses and such, anybody can beat anybody on any given night.” Parity. Schmarity. We just think the gridiron geezer may have lost it. This is a guy who called one of last week’s games a “toss-up.” Final score? 51-0! With predictions like that, the only digging he’s been doing is his own grave. Our fearless forcasters disagreed on a pair of BVC games this week. Hanneman took Arcadia and Riverdale and Baker likes Cory-Rawson and North Baltimore. Hanneman’s Picks Findlay over TOLEDO ST. JOHN’S — Trojans were young and inexperienced when the season started. They’ll have to play like seasoned veterans from here on out. Arcadia over CORY-RAWSON — Should be a good matchup between 1-4 teams. Looks like Redskins have a few more weapons on offense, though. LIBERTY-BENTON over Arlington — The Division V Eagles will need every win they can get from here on out if they want to be playing in Week 11. HOPEWELL-LOUDON over Pandora-Gilboa — Chieftains made their statement last week. Now they have to back it up. Van Buren over VANLUE — Love those Cats, but I don’t like their chances. McCOMB over Leipsic — Panthers will be tested the second half of the season. I don’t think they’ll be beaten, but they will be tested. RIVERDALE over North Baltimore — Upset special. Falcons played pretty well last week; Tigers didn’t. Buckeye Central over CAREY — Bucks handled Upper Sandusky; Carey didn’t. SENECA EAST over Mohawk — Warriors are 0-2 against 4-1 teams this season. Upper Sandusky over BUCYRUS — Chance for the Rams to rebound from back to back losses and crank up some momentum for the stretch run. Fostoria over ELMWOOD — Redmen can put some points on the board, when they don’t turn the ball over. Western Reserve Academy over Lakota — Pioneers are more club team than OHSAA, but they’ve played some good programs tough. Ada over CONVOY CRESTVIEW — Ada beat Grove; Crestview didn’t. Delphos Jefferson over BLUFFTON — Pirates are 3-0 at home, but Jefferson’s “D” has been extremely tough to crack. Spencerville over COLUMBUS GROVE — Bearcats are to the NWC what Coldwater, Marion Local and Minster are to the MAC. Patrick Henry over ARCHBOLD — If the Blue Streaks thought they were getting a break this week after facing Lake (5-0), Swanton (5-0) and Wauseon (4-1), they’ll be in for a surprise. HARDIN NORTHERN over Ridgemont — Bears should bounce back big from loss to Fort Loramie. OTTAWA-GLANDORF over Defiance — Records, stats, recent history all point to an O-G win. But this Route 15 rivalry is never, ever easy. Baker’s Picks Findlay over TOLEDO ST. JOHN’S — Johnnies are 4-1 but haven’t beaten a team with a winning record. Big TRAC test for the Trojans. CORY-RAWSON over Arcadia — Should be a competitive game. Hornets are coming off a win and a chance to build some momentum. LIBERTY-BENTON over Arlington — Red Devils are struggling a bit on offense and I have to believe the Eagles get it together after last week’s loss. HOPEWELL-LOUDON over Pandora-Gilboa — Someone at Hopewell-Loudon told me to keep picking against them. Sorry Charlie. Van Buren over VANLUE — Van Buren appears to be back on track after back-to-back big wins. McCOMB over Leipsic — One AP voter gave the Panthers a first-place vote in the Division VII poll this week. Smart man. North Baltimore over RIVERDALE — Falcons are getting better and wins will come. I wouldn’t be surprised if they pull off the upset here. Buckeye Central over CAREY — There’s some winnable games on the Carey schedule — this isn’t one of them. SENECA EAST over Mohawk — Could be one of the best games in the area. Take the Tigers in a nail-biter. Upper Sandusky over BUCYRUS — Alliteration time: Rams roll Redmen. Fostoria over ELMWOOD — Redmen start the second half of the season with a win Hudson Western Reserve Academy over LAKOTA — Always tough to gauge a non-OHSAA WRA team when they come to the region. Ada over CONVOY CRESTVIEW — Trying to pick games in the NWC is like walking through a minefield. Delphos Jefferson over BLUFFTON — Tough stretch of games for the Pirates. Spencerville over COLUMBUS GROVE — Bearcats haven’t been tested yet, Bulldogs will have to be at their best in this one. Patrick Henry over ARCHBOLD — Pats get another NWOAL win against a struggling Archbold squad. HARDIN NORTHERN over Ridgemont — I know it’s early, but Polar Bears need to keep winning to stay in playoff contention. OTTAWA-GLANDORF over Defiance — Titans aren’t flashy, they just win.
