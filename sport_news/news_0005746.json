Byrne Wednesday, October 21, 2015 New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick watches from the sideline in the first half of an NFL football game against the Indianapolis Colts in Indianapolis, Sunday, Oct. 18, 2015. (AP Photo/AJ Mast) Tweet \nVictory in the NFL often is a matter of brains over brawn. \nWe witnessed a classic example of a smart team out-muscling a dumb team Sunday night, as the Patriots schooled the Colts, 34-27, in the highly anticipated rematch of the AFC title game that launched Deflategate. \nIn recent years, the Patriots physically steamrolled the Colts. But on Sunday, they won a battle of wits, playing smart, efficient football when the Colts played dumb, inefficient football. Indy’s mental malaise was compounded by a third-quarter panic attack and self-doubting bouts of inadequacy in the face of the Patriots, who dominate this so-called rivalry year after year. \nThe Patriots today are No. 3 on the Cold Hard Football Facts Intelligence Index, our measure of all-around efficiency in all phases of the game, behind only a pair of fellow intellectual heavyweights, the well-coached Packers and Steelers. The middling, milquetoast C-student Colts are No. 16. \nThe Patriots under Bill Belichick are an intellectual dynasty, typically one of the smartest teams in football. New England finished No. 1 on the Intelligence Index last year and used that ability to outwit opponents all the way to a Super Bowl title. \nArmed with this information, Sunday’s game followed a fairly predictable statistical pattern. \nQuarterbacks Tom Brady and Andrew Luck each passed for 312 yards and three touchdowns. The Patriots ran for 116 yards; the Colts 120. Brady was sacked twice for a loss of 11 yards; Luck, three times for a loss of 23 yards. The Pats ended the day with 417 yards of offense; the Colts 409. \nSo the game was an even match physically. \nBut it was a mismatch mentally. The smart team won. The dumb team lost. \nThe Colts, their tiny craniums apparently overwhelmed by the moment, made the biggest gaffe of the game — a comically bad effort some have called one of the dumbest plays in history. \nThe entire football world knows the story of Indy’s inept botched punt. We don’t need to rehash the details here. Suffice it to say, the Colts suffered a mental meltdown in every way: coaching, formation, intuition, execution. You name it. \nBut Indy’s stupidity is only half the story. A dumb opponent might have blown the opportunity handed them, much like the dumb Browns did Sunday against the Broncos. \nThe Patriots, however, are not a dumb opponent. They live to feast on opponent mistakes — as the Intelligence Index proves year after year. The smart Patriots quickly took advantage of the short field, driving 35 yards in just six plays to score a touchdown and build an insurmountable 34-21 lead early in the fourth quarter. \nIt was an instant-classic moment in the history of the Intelligence Index. \nThis indicator is simply a measure of overall efficiency in all phases of the game. A smart, well-coached offense needs minimal effort to score maximum points. The measure we use is yards per point scored. If a team needs 100 yards to score 10 points, they average 10.0 yards per point scored. Great, efficient number. \nThe Patriots in this instance needed only 35 yards to put seven points on the board. Nice, efficient work if you can get it. \nConversely, a smart, well-coached defense forces opponents to use maximum effort to score minimum points. The measure we use is yards per point allowed. If an opponents needs 200 yards to score 10 points, the defenses averages 20.0 yards per point allowed. \nThe Intelligence Index simply measures the difference between the two. Subtract yards per point scored (offensive efficiency) from yards per point allowed (defensive efficiency) and you have overall efficiency, or what we like to call team-wide intelligence. In this case, said team would be plus-10.0 on the Intelligence Index. \nThe Patriots in the Brady-Belichick era routinely have excelled in “bendability” — they make opponents march long distances to gain few points. But the team’s true bread and butter is on offense. The Pats waste few opportunities to put points on the board. They score points with historic efficiency year after year. \nThe 2015 season already has provided more evidence. The Patriots are No. 1 again in offensive efficiency. They produce the equivalent of a single point for every 11.5 yards of offense. \nCompare that to the Chargers, who scored just 20 points Sunday against the Packers despite 503 passing yards by Philip Rivers. Dim-witted San Diego ranks No. 30 in offensive efficiency. The Bolts need a whopping 19.1 yards to score the equivalent of a single point. \nPut in terms of a touchdown and extra point: The Pats need just 80.5 yards of offense to score seven points; San Diego needs 133.7 yards. That huge efficiency difference quickly translates to wins and losses, as each team proved Sunday. \nAt the end of the day, smart teams are well-coached teams. The Intelligence Index merely confirms what most fans suspect: Bill Belichick is a smart coach. Tom Brady is an efficient quarterback. \nThe Pats’ opponents this week, the New York Jets, pose a greater intellectual challenge than the Colts. The Jets are No. 9 on the Intelligence Index, after finishing the 2014 season under Rex Ryan at No. 30. \nThe Jets were among the dumbest teams in football last year; they’re one of the smartest this year. It’s a sign that rookie coach Todd Bowles has the team pointed in the right direction and that the Jets might finally be ready to match wits with the Patriots. \n**** \nCOLD, HARD FOOTBALL FACTS INTELLIGENCE INDEX \nThe Cold Hard Football Facts Intelligence Index separates smart, efficient, well-coached teams from dumb, inefficient, poorly coached teams.
