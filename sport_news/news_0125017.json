They fell behind, 7-0, against Columbia and responded with 42 unanswered points. \nAgainst Yale (4-2, 1-2), they trailed by 10-0 at the end of the first quarter and proceeded to outscore Yale, 34-10, the rest of the way. \nFreshman receiver Christian Pearson, who caught a Penn freshman-record 10 passes last week, caught a pair of touchdowns  one for 63 yards and another for 23  and finished with six receptions for 133 yards. Opposite him, Justin Watson caught eight passes for 105 yards. \nSophomore running back Tre Solomon rushed for a career-high 121 yards on 18 carries. He caught a 17-yard touchdown from Torgersen in the second quarter - when the Quakers scored 20 points - and he iced the game with a 27-yard touchdown run with 8:13 left. \nDefensively, linebacker Tyler Drake continued to play at a high level. After snaring an interception last week, Drake picked off another one Friday and also recorded a sack. \nPenn defensive backs Ian Dobbins helped the defense snuff out third quarter threats. On back-to-back drives, Yale drove to the Penn 10- and 12-yard lines only to have Ian Dobbins and Dylan Muscat end them with interceptions in the Penn end zone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:30:34.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
