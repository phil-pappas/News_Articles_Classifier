Are we talking about playoffs? \nSure, we’re talking playoffs for Major League Baseball. \nI’ve just wondered why we use the word playoffs for the PGA’s FedEx Cup competition, which finished up last weekend with Jordan Spieth winning, or for NASCAR’s Sprint Cup Chase. Never thought of those two sports with playoffs, unless in golf your referring to a playoff at the end of a tournament when golfers are tied. \nJust an observation. \nMy worry for playoffs is how the Kansas City Royals sputtered through September and this final week of regular season play. They won a division title for the first time since 1985 — they were the American League West champions then — controlling the American League Central for much of the season. \nSome out there believe the Royals peaked too soon this season, and they have nothing left for the playoffs this year. Me? I’m a Royals fan — have been since 1969, do or die, win or lose — so, sure I believe in another playoff run. \nIn 2014, Kansas City proved any team can put together a strong run in the postseason. It was a wild card team, winning on the road to reach the World Series. Now, the Royals have to show they are a divisional champion and defending American League champion by winning as the home team in much of the playoffs. \nHome field advantage for the American League playoffs is still up in the air. Following Thursday night’s games, the Royals and American League East champion Toronto are tied. The Blue Jays lost and the Royals won, so they both have 92 victories. The Texas Rangers are leading the AL West but no division champion is determined. The New York Yankees clinched a wild card berth and Houston Astros are in the running for the AL West title or a wild card berth. \nThe National League is cut-and-dried for the playoffs. Divisional champions are the New York Mets in the East, the St. Louis Cardinals in the Central and the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West. How about those Cubbies? The Chicago Cubs will play the Pittsburgh Pirates in the NL wild card game — that’s right the wild card teams play just one game, win or go home. \nPlayoffs for MLB begin Tuesday with the American League wild card game followed by the National League wild card game on Wednesday. The AL divisional playoffs begin Thursday and the NL divisional playoffs start Friday. The ALCS begins Oct. 16 and the first game of the NLCS is Oct. 17. \nThe 2015 World Series with home field advantage to the American League Champion is Oct. 27-Nov. 4. \nSure, I want the Royals to win it all. That’s what you want as a fan, right? As a lifer for the Royals, I’m just happy to see my guys in Blue playing competitive baseball again. They are relevant in the whole scheme of things in MLB again. \nRemember to wear pink to Friday night’s Newton High football game and Saturday’s NHS volleyball tournament. \nContact Jocelyn Sheets at 641-792-3121 ext. 6535 or jsheets@newtondailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:10:11.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
