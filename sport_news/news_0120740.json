But none of the other robbers, the teller wrote in a victim impact statement included in Griffin's file at Hillsborough County Superior Court in Nashua, were anywhere near \"as blatant about their actions\" as was Griffin, the 54-year-old former Newport man who was sentenced last month to three to six years in the New Hampshire State Prison after pleading guilty to a charge of theft stemming from the Sept. 11, 2013, robbery of the Bank of America branch at 356 Daniel Webster Highway in Merrimack. The plea and sentencing capped a lengthy court case rife with twists and turns that came to a head on Sept. 3, when Griffin, on the verge of cementing a plea agreement at a hearing in front of Judge David Garfunkel, rendered the agreement moot when he told Garfunkel he \"wouldn't have hurt anybody\" when the judge asked him if he knew of any reason he shouldn't accept Griffin's guilty plea. Garfunkel, exasperated, immediately rejected the plea agreement and ordered the case to trial. But prosecutors and Griffin's attorney, Anthony Introcaso, instead were able to recraft an agreement that puts Griffin in prison for three to six years, with six months suspended. But since Griffin also gets credit for 723 days of time served in jail, his minimum sentence amounts to just under seven months. He is also ordered, once he is freed, to stay away from the Bank of America in Merrimack and have no contact with its employees. Meanwhile, both the teller and her supervisor submitted victim impact statements to Griffin's file, both of whom describe a man who \"knew exactly what he was doing\" and came across as \"one of the most calm and cocky\" of the several robbers the women said they have encountered in their careers. That Griffin wore a mask - specifically, a mask depicting President Obama - and told the teller he \"was here to make an unscheduled withdrawal\" and that \"we need to redistribute the wealth\" showed the robbery was \"definitely planned out, thought out and ... did not seem like a big deal to Mr. Griffin,\" the supervisor wrote. In urging the court to impose a lengthy sentence for Griffin, the supervisor said the teller \"rethinks (the robbery) over and over,\" how he \"came at her ... so calm and brazen, and with zero care (about) how this would affect the person he approached. \"This is the type of thing that stays with a person for a long time,\" she said of the teller. \"It does not go away. It is scary.\" Dean Shalhoup can be reached at 594-6443, dshalhoup@nashuatelegraph.com or @Telegraph_DeanS.
