On consecutive drives, Rutgers drove 170 yards on 27 plays - a 79-yard touchdown drive and a 91-yard field goal drive - to tie the score and set up MSU’s game-winning march.\n“I wouldn't say they were wearing us down,” MSU senior defensive end Shilique Calhoun said after winning in the return to his home state. “I would say that we weren't in our gaps, we weren't playing the way Spartan dawgs usually play. And I think we lost a little bit of our focus. (The touchdown drive) kind of got us uneasy and kind of thinking of other things and trying to do other people's jobs.\n“But toward the end, we realized we can only do our job and have trust and faith in our teammates that they'll be doing what they need to do, and of course that's what happened. We came up big at the end. I think Malik McDowell had a sack at the end of the game and it just shows if you trust in your teammates, good things can happen. All you can do is do your job. You can't do someone else's job because that's when the defense breaks down.”\nThat’s been a frequent discussion for MSU this season, and MSU coach Mark Dantonio identified two coverage busts that hurt the Spartans in those drives, to go with 81 rushing yards.\n“We’ve got to correct things that we make mistakes on,” Dantonio said, “but I can’t fault the effort of our players or how hard they play or our toughness. We’re gonna keep playing.”\nMSU-Indiana kickoff set : MSU’s Oct. 24 home game against Indiana will kick off at 3:30 p.m., the Big Ten announced Monday.
