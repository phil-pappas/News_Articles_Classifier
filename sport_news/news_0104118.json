Van Gisbergen snares Gold Coast V8s pole \nHolden’s Shane Van Gisbergen has snared pole position from fellow New Zealander Scott McLaughlin for Saturday’s V8 Supercars race on the Gold Coast. \nThe Tekno Autosports driver posted a fastest lap of one minute and 11.5442 seconds on the 2.98km Surfers Paradise street circuit in the top-10 shootout for pole. \nA previous winner on the Gold Coast, Van Gisbergen’s pole is his first P1 for the season. \nHe finished ahead of fellow New Zealander Scott McLaughlin. \nThe Volvo driver will start from second after posting a 1:11.6854, narrowly missing out on pole position to Van Gisbergen. \nChampionship leader Mark Winterbottom qualified third for the 300km race, alongside Nissan’s Rick Kelly. \nWinterbottom’s main championship rival, Bathurst champion Craig Lowndes, will start from sixth position. \nLowndes’s teammate, defending series champion Jamie Whincup, had been hoping to put his Bathurst nightmare behind him where he was penalised late in the 1000km endurance classic for passing the safety car. \nWhincup had qualified second-fastest for the shootout but a ragged lap means he’ll have to start the race from seventh position. \nSaturday’s race begins at 2.35pm AEST.
