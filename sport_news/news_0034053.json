River East was the last unbeaten team left in the Kas Vidruk (AA) Division. \n“We played really great defensively,” said Massey head coach Mike Steeves. “We didn’t give up many yards at all. One of their touchdowns was a punt return and the other one was an interception to the 15-yard line and they scored on that. Defensively, we battled and held them to not many yards. Offensively, we scored on a really important drive to put us ahead and it was something he hadn’t done all year and it was nice to see.” \nRowan led Massey with 191 yards on the ground, including a 65-yard run for a score. He also had three punts inside the five-yard line — and another inside the 10. Rowan unloaded a 63-yard punt in the final 20 seconds to give the Kodiaks a long field and virtually secure the victory. \nMack Adams ran for 45 more yards on six carries, while quarterback David Bachewich had six rushes for 31 yards, a touchdown and also ran for a two-point convert. Bachewich completed three of seven passes for 31 yards. \nJoel Fisseha led the defence with nine tackles and recovered a fumble. Schmidt added four tackles, while Ryan Doherty chipped in with five. \n“The coaches and I talked and it was one of the best games we’ve seen as coaches at Massey,” Steeves said. “It was a true team effort from special teams to offence to defence and it was a great way for the Grade 12s to end their career for Massey on our home field.” \nThe Vikings wrap up the regular season on Oct. 23 when they visit the Steinbach Sabres (4-1). The Crocus Plainsmen (1-4) visit the Elmwood Giants (4-1) today. \n» The Brandon Sun", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:02:56.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
