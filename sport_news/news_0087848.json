Playing a very difficult player. It's not easy when you step on court with him,\" he said. \nHaving come into the match, the Spaniard led the duo's ATP head-to-head 3-1 but Tomic had won their most recent clash on hard-court at Indian Wells and had come off an impressive straight-set win over Ferrer's compatriot Fernando Verdasco in the first round at Shanghai. \nTalking about the past season, Tomic was very satisfied with his improvement. \nThe 22-year-old said: \"I feel very confident.
