He hasn't played in a major league game since Sept. 25 at Cincinnati, when he reaggravated the injury. \nUribe said he feels \"good\" and is \"trying\" to be ready in time for the World Series, which begins on Tuesday, Oct. 27. \nWhen asked if Uribe could potentially make the Mets' World Series roster, manager Terry Collins said, \"I don't know.\" \nPLUS : Why Mets' Yoenis Cespedes missed Friday's workout \nWhile Uribe could offer a dangerous right-handed bat off the bench, Collins pointed out that the Kansas City Royals, one of the Mets' potential World Series opponents , have no left-handed starters in their rotation. Furthermore, Uribe hasn't played in nearly a month. \nUribe's injury opened up a spot on the Mets' postseason roster for outfielder Kirk Nieuwenhuis, who bats left-handed and is 0-for-2 in two playoff at-bats. \nUribe, 36, is one of the few members on the team with World Series experience, as he won two rings with the Chicago White Sox and the San Francisco Giants. \nMaria Guardado may be reached at mguardado@njadvancemedia.com .
