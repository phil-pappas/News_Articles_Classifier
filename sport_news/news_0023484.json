That’s just the family business. \n“I feel a lot of pressure with that,” Hunter said. “But I just try to ignore it and play the best I can.” \nWith that in mind, Hunter headed into the second day of the Class 4A state tennis tournament at Winfield’s T.H. Vaughn Tennis Center just hoping to put her best foot forward. In doing that, though, the Wildcat freshman followed in her brother’s footsteps and became a state champion. \nHunter rolled past Wichita Collegiate freshman Sydney Lair 6-1, 6-3 in the semifinals, setting up a showdown with defending 4A champion and unbeaten Sayaka Smith of Coffeyville for the state title. After a tight 6-4 battle in the first set, Hunter took complete control of the match and posted a 6-1 win in the second to knock off Smith and fill her spot in the family legacy. \n“I knew I had a chance, but I really didn’t expect to win it,” Hunter said. “I was just going to play my best and not really go in with first-place expectations. It was just go out there and play.” \nHunter finished the season 15-1, while Smith lost for the first time in three years and finished 32-1 after going 32-0 last year in winning the state title. \nSmith’s strength is a power game, using strong ground strokes to overpower most of her opponents. But Hunter was able to mix up her game, keeping Smith from settling in, and Hayden coach Christy Sheetz said that was a major key to the victory. \n“Smith plays a hard ground-stroke game and she’s really consistent,” Sheetz said. “Brooklyn took her out of her game. She hit some slices, some drop shots, some lobs and just took Smith’s timing out. That really helped her out a lot. She ws really aggressive with setting up her points, not necessarily her play, and she thought about every single point.” \nHunter, who also doubles as a standout hitter for Hayden’s No. 1-ranked volleyball team, suffered her only loss to Emporia’s Ashley DeBauge at the Centennial League meet. But she made quick work of the Class 4A field, losing just two games during Friday’s first two matches before handling Saturday’s foes. \n“I was a little nervous, but I also knew if my game-plan wasn’t working out, I had a backup I could go off of,” Hunter said. “I was pretty confident because I knew how I wanted to play (Smith). I’d watched her play before and knew what I wanted to do if I saw her. I knew she had just as good of a chance as I did, but I also knew I had nothing to lose because she was the state champ last year and had all the pressure. \n“It’s a big accomplishment for me. It was one of the goals I had and I’m glad I got it done.” \nCLASS 5A \nAfter pulling an upset on Friday to get into the 5A semifinals at Valley Center, Shawnee Heights senior Madison Lysaught couldn’t quite keep the momentum going on Saturday. \nLysaught dropped a 6-1, 6-2 decision to eventual champion Do-Hee Lee of Andover in the semifinals and then fell 3-6, 6-2, 6-2 to Carroll’s Natalie Lubbers in the third-place match, settling for a career-best fourth-place finish. \nSeaman’s doubles team of Sarah Knight and Shyanne Osterhaus took 12th, dropping all three matches on Saturday after reaching the quarterfinals on Friday. \nHeights’ Madison Foster placed 10th in singles and Emporia’s Ashley DeBauge took fifth, rolling through the consolation bracket and beating St. James’ Catherine Rieke 9-1 in the consolation finals. \nShawnee Heights tied for fourth in the team standings with Lansing, each scoring 18, while Emporia finished tied for sixth. \nCLASS 6A \nWashburn Rural’s Avery Munns and Darby Hirsch finished seventh in doubles at the Class 6A meet at Olathe’s College Boulevard Athletic Center, topping Derby’s Mackenzie Hughes and Isabella Smith 9-4 in the seventh-place match. After losing in Friday’s quarterfinals, Munns and Hirsch topped Blue Valley’s Lizzy Meizenbach and Mallory Novicoff 9-2 in the consolation bracket before falling 9-1 to Shawnee Mission East’s Joie Freirich and Lucy Kendall in the consolation semifinals. \nLaura Nicolae took 11th in singles, beating Manhattan’s Lexi Beiker 9-5 in the 11th-place match. \nRural finished fifth as a team, tying Blue Valley West for fourth with 15 points.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T01:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:54:43.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
