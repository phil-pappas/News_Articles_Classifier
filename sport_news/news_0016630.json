Spiral potatoes and loaded nachos were crowd favorites this year. Mt. Vernon native Bill Bekemeier's family created the recipe the festival uses today.\n\"I cooked on this corner in 1968. We've been here quite a few years, this is the old German recipe,\" Bekemeier said.\nHudson said like every year, they sell out early.\n\"We plan to make 350 cases. They'll be 22 in this one today, so we're at 330 plus. Sold out of it in 24 hours basically,\" Hudson said.\nThe event drew 100,000 people to Mount Vernon this weekend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:51:36.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
