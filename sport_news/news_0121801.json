The Mariners lost a close game against Garden Grove, which Westminster – ranked second in the Southern Division – edged in its season opener. \n“It’s out of our hands. I think we deserve it,” Pacifica first-year coach Vinnie Lopez said of the rankings. “I think we’re definitely a playoff team in this division. We’ve got a shot to win the Empire.” \nPacifica stated its case against Westminster (4-1), well aware that the Lions were a common opponent with Garden Grove. \nGarcia ran 18 times from the Mariners’ four-receiver spread attack, racking up 128 yards. The senior had touchdown runs of 2, 9, 14 and 2 yards. \nPacifica running back Marcus Tolbert rushed for 105 yards, including a 29-yard touchdown run, on 14 carries. \nGarcia showed his arm in the second half with touchdown passes of 28 and 27 yards to Matthew Moslenko . \nAfter losing a fumble on their first possession, the Mariners scored on nine consecutive possessions. \nIt was a must-win and I definitely think we proved a point,” said Garcia, who completed 8 of 10 passes for 88 yards. \nPacifica’s defense forced three second-half fumbles, including two on kickoff coverage. The Mariners’ special teams stood out early as Aundree Purnell returned the opening kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown. \n“They’ve been rapidly improving but we also helped their cause,” Westminster coach Ted McMillen said. \nPacifica finished 2-8 the past two seasons but landed Lopez, an ex-assistant at Rancho Alamitos, after his turnaround tenure at El Rancho. Linebacker Jacob Handley said Lopez has been the biggest factor for the Mariners’ start. \n“It’s got to be our coach,” Handley said. “Our coach has got us a great offense, great defense. ... We just do the simple things. We don’t make a whole lot of big plays. We just dominate games.” \nPacifica scored 20 points in the second quarter to lead, 34-14, at halftime. \nThe Mariners made the Lions pay for struggles on consecutive punts, scoring two touchdowns in a span of about 21/2 minutes. \nLeading 20-14 in the second, Pacifica started a series at the Westminster 28 after a punt of minus-1 yard with 7:14 left in the quarter. Garcia ran the ball on four consecutive plays, including a 9-yard touchdown, with 5:56 left in the second quarter. \nPacifica stopped a fake punt on the Lions’ next possession, giving the Mariners the ball at the Westminster 32. Three plays later, Garcia scored on a 14-yard run. \nContact the writer: dalbano@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T16:17:31.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
