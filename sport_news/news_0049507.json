Aldridge had two holes left when first-round play was suspended because of darkness. \nPatrick Rodgers, Patton Kizzire, Chad Campbell, Ryan Palmer, Ricky Barnes, D.H. Lee, Ryo Ishikawa, Greg Owen, Shane Bertsch and Brendon Todd shot 65, and Henrik Norlander also was 6 under with two holes left. \nKizzire is making his first start as a PGA Tour member after winning twice last year on the Web.com Tour and topping the regular-season and finals-combined money lists. He was married Saturday. \nJimmy Walker opened with a 66, and U.S. Presidents Cup teammate Rickie Fowler had a 72. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
