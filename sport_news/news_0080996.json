(Matt Rourke/AP) Travel Deals Les Bowen Posted: Monday, October 19, 2015, 10:19 PM \nDespite an offense that lurched and shuddered, the Eagles entered halftime with a 17-7 lead over the NFC East rival New York Giants, thanks to three turnovers by the visitors, who equaled their total for the season entering the game. \nThe Giants’ opening-series touchdown drive looked ominously easy. They drove 80 yards in eight plays with one Eagles penalty, never even facing third down, mixing runs and short passes. Many of the passes were to the middle of the field, where they found extraordinary amounts of room. \nThe touchdown pass to Odell Beckham Jr. covered 18 yards. Beckham went down at the 2, but no one was close enough to touch him – Chris Maragos was closest – and he rolled into the end zone. His much-discussed hamstring seemed to run and roll just fine. Beckham finished the half with 7 catches for 61 yards. \nEli Manning jogged off the field for the first time 5 for 5 for 59 yards and a TD. At halftime, he was 18 for 25 for 162, the TD and two picks.

They needed a roughing-the-passer call on Damontre Moore to get their initial first down of the game, but then they clicked into gear. Seven plays, 78 yards, capped by a 32-yard Sam Bradford pass to Riley Cooper tied the score with 3:33 left in the first. \nThe Eagles took the lead on another turnover. Manning equaled his 2015 interception total entering the game, when he flung the ball toward Dwayne Harris at the sideline but found Nolan Carroll, who stepped in front and pranced into the end zone for the easiest 17-yard touchdown of his career. \nThe Giants were moving again, aided by a phantom roughing penalty on Cedric Thornton, when Malcolm Jenkins poked the ball out of Rashad Jennings’ grasp and Ryans recovered, just before leaving the game with a hamstring problem. So the Giants doubled their 2015 turnover total in the first 19 minutes, 26 seconds. \nThe Eagles gave it right back, though, on a Bradford overthrow of Zach Ertz that went right into the midsection of Jayron Hosley. \nThe Eagles got their final three points of the half on a 37-yard Caleb Sturgis field goal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:46:21.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
