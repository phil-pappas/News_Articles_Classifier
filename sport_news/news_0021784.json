I don’t think he’s a striker in the way that Kun (Aguero) or (Wilfried) Bony is. But he’s a player who must improve his finishing. \n“I said when he arrived here that he must improve. I’m sure that this season he will score more goals than in previous seasons when he played for Liverpool.” \nPellegrini substituted Sterling after a poor individual first-half performance during City’s 6-1 thrashing of Newcastle United two weeks ago, but he said the move had not left the 20-year-old disheartened. \n“He didn’t lose confidence after the Newcastle game, because I spoke to him as I took him off,” Pellegrini said. “He didn’t play well. But all the players can have a bad day. \n“But I think this game was important for him, and for the team to change his position. Near Bony, he can create more space, because Bony supports very well with the ball. \n“We put Kevin De Bruyne in Raheem’s position and that was good and allowed him to score more goals.” City took advantage of a Bournemouth side who were left in defensive disarray after goalkeeper Artur Boruc had to pull out with a thigh injury 20 minutes before kick-off. \nStand-in Adam Federici was at fault for two of City’s goals, dropping a simple cross at the feet of Bony, who pounced to score the first goal of a double. \nVisiting manager Eddie Howe felt that his team had paid the price for making too many avoidable mistakes. \nBournemouth were 2-0 down inside the first 11 minutes and were well beaten despite Glenn Murray pulling a goal back in the first half. \n“We were not going to underestimate the size of the task we had today (Saturday). We always knew it was going to be very difficult,” he said. \n“It was our first experience of the top four and we didn’t deal with it very well. \n“We’ve made quite a few individual errors and I think if you come to a place such as this, the last thing you need to do is give them goals, especially early in the game. \n“That made it very difficult for us. The pleasing thing is that we showed character in the second half. There was a spell during the first half where I felt we were on top, but we couldn’t maintain it.” \nNext up for City is a Champions League home game with Europa League champions Sevilla on Wednesday. \nBournemouth, meanwhile, have a week to lick their wounds before next weekend’s home game with Tottenham Hotspur.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:56:40.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
