See more sports photos at fnpinfocus.com. \nMIDDLETOWN — Decked out in their bright orange jerseys and pants, seven Middletown seniors posed for a photo after Friday’s football game. \n“We started that when we were freshmen, and we’ve been doing it with the same group of guys ever since,” Knights senior KJ Bromwell said. “My mom took it after one freshman game. We did it JV year, we did it junior year and now we’re doing it our senior year.” \nIt’s hard to imagine a better night to get that senior photo, considering Middletown’s dominating performance in its 41-0 win over Catoctin. \nMiddletown’s offense scored on every possession except two, the defense posted its first shutout since the season opener, and special teams got a pair of field goals from Bromwell. \nThe end result was a convincing win over Catoctin, the third straight victory for a 4-3 Middletown team that most likely will have to win out to return to the playoffs for the first time since 2013. \n“We had one of the best weeks of practice we had all season,” Bromwell said. “We strung four great days together. We came out here, and we just executed like we’ve been wanting to all year.” \nAfter the thorough performance, Knights coach Kevin Lynott was thoroughly pleased. \nI’m proud of how our guys played together as a team,” he said. “Man, there was enthusiasm, there was physicalness. I think that’s the theme of tonight — the physicalness and the togetherness was really fun to watch.” \nThe togetherness was still on display after the game during moments such as the annual photo of Bromwell, Grant Dougherty, Daniel Pirrone, James Early, Louis Prensky, Ryan Parker and Marquis Lauer. \nAs for Middletown’s physical play, there were plenty of examples. \nWhen Catoctin receiver Anthony Bowers got his hands on an incoming pass in the first quarter, he was drilled by Pirrone, whose jarring hit caused the incompletion. \nMatt Pritts sprinted into the backfield and dragged down quarterback Zachary Scott for a sack. Andrew Wenner and Jace Denham also delivered hard tackles for loss. \nMiddletown’s offense also had a show of force. Throughout the game, Knights linemen were opening huge holes. And after going through them, running backs Early and Anthony Orsini often bowled over other defenders for additional yardage after it looked like they were stopped. \n“Just keep your legs turning, get low, keep your legs high, and no one’s going to tackle you,” said Early, who used to play fullback. “That’s fundamental football right there. That’s what our coaches drill in practice.” \nEarly rushed for 137 yards on 14 carries, all in the first half, including touchdown runs of 9 and 23 yards. Orsini rushed for 117 yards on eight carries, scoring on runs of 30 and 20 yards. \nMiddletown’s offense was far from one-dimensional. Quarterback Matt Evich completed 6 of 7 passes for 81 yards, including a 17-yard touchdown pass to Lauer. Tyler Clemmer caught three passes for 44 yards, Lauer had three receptions for 37 yards, and Wenner caught a two-point conversion pass from Evich. \nThe Knights only punted once. The only other possession they didn’t score came when they had a second-and-1 on Catoctin’s 8 as the running clock expired in the fourth quarter. \nBromwell, a former soccer player who switched to football in middle school because his friends played that sport, kicked field goals of 24 and 35 yards. He also made an interception in the end zone with 7:09 left in the third quarter, ending Catoctin’s most promising drive. \nFor the Cougars, Scott completed 10 passes for 101 yards. Seth Gillis, Bowers and Nathan Rednowers all made big catches. Passing helped the Cougars (3-4) move the ball against a Middletown defense that held Catoctin to 79 yards on 28carries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:28:19.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
