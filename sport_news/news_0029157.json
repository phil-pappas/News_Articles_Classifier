Jeff Tambellini notched both of the Crunch goals while Kristers Gudlevskis stopped 27 of 28 shots faced to earn the victory in net for Syracuse. \nTambellini scored the lone goal of the first period when he managed to beat the B-Sens’ Matt O’Connor over the glove hand to give the hosts the 1-0 lead. Syracuse skated to the intermission with a 1-0 lead and an 8-7 advantage in shots on goal. \nWBNG E-News - Sign Up For Our Newsletter! \nBinghamton responded with the only goal in the second period when Cole Schneider recorded his first tally of the year on a shorthanded goal 4:58 into the frame. Schneider managed to outskate a Syracuse defender to the puck in the neutral zone and beat Gudlevskis one-on-one on the backhand. \nA penalty filled third period appeared to yield nothing for either team, but just as the B-Sens returned to full strength Tambellini fired home his second of the night to give the hosts the 2-1 victory. \nBoth Binghamton and Syracuse finished 0-for-5 on the power play while O’Connor stopped 24 of 26 shots faced in the losing effort. \n(Courtesy: Binghamton Senators)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:37:43.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
