(AP) - Ralph Webb rushed for 99 yards and scored the game's only touchdown, leading Vanderbilt coach Derek Mason to his first Southeastern Conference win in 12 tries with a 10-3 victory over Missouri on Saturday.\nVanderbilt (3-4, 1-3 SEC) was powered by a defense that held Missouri to 188 total yards and 10 first downs. Missouri (4-4, 1-4) suffered its third straight loss.\nMissouri drove to the Vanderbilt 13-yard line late in the game before turning the ball over on downs with five seconds left.\nVanderbilt (38:24) nearly doubled Missouri's (21:36) time of possession.\nVanderbilt freshman Kyle Shurmur made his first career start in place of redshirt-sophomore Johnny McCrary, who has thrown 10 interceptions, the most in the Southeastern Conference. He completed 10 of 20 for 89 yards before being relieved by McCrary.\nDrew Lock threw for 108 yards and Andrew Baggett kicked a 35-yard field goal for Missouri.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
