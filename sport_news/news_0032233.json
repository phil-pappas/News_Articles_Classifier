The Bosnian had a short spell in management at SC Neukirchen before becoming Klopp's assistant at the Coface Arena in 2001. He followed his friend to Dortmund, helping in the revival of the club that saw them win two Bundesliga titles and reach the Champions League final in 2013. \nMeanwhile, 43-year-old Krawietz worked alongside their pair at Mainz and at Signal Iduna Park, focusing on video analysis in his role as Klopp's chief scout. \nKlopp, delivering his first press conference as Liverpool manager, explained his decision to take the Anfield reins in a statement to the club website. \nHe said: \"Firstly, I would like to offer thanks to the ownership of Liverpool Football Club for showing faith in me and my staff and presenting us with this wonderful opportunity. They have presented to me a very clear vision and I share their ambitions and model of work. \n\"I am very excited by the challenge we face and eager to start the job and begin implementing our ideas and ways of working with this team. This is a talented group of players and there is still much to compete for this season. \n\"Winning is important but so is how you win and how you play the game. I believe in a playing philosophy that is very emotional, very fast and very strong. My teams must play at full throttle and take it to the limit every single game. \n\"It is important to have a playing philosophy that reflects your own mentality, reflects the club and gives you a clear direction to follow. Tactical of course, but tactical with a big heart. \n\"Liverpool has extraordinary supporters and Anfield is a world renowned home, with an incredible atmosphere. I want to build a great relationship with these supporters and give them memories to cherish. I hope we can feed off each other's energy and that we take this journey together.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T12:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T12:57:36.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
