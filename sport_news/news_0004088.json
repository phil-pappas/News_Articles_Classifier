The Sooners rank seventh in the Big 12, averaging 163.5 yards rushing per game. Last year, they led the league with 261.2 rushing yards per game.\nOU is averaging 40 rushes per game, compared with 43 last season. Quarterback Baker Mayfield averages 11 rushes per game. Running back Joe Mixon is averaging 34 yards a game.\nPerine said the running backs and line have been progressing. He rushed 22 times for 152 yards against Tulsa on Sept. 19, his lone 100-yard game this season. He also caught a touchdown pass in the double overtime win at Tennessee.\n\"If we're putting points on the board, I'm happy,\" Perine said. \"I don't care about anything else.\n\"[Defenses] are going to be more focused on the passing game because our running game isn't going as great as we'd like. And once that happens and we keep chugging away at the run game, eventually that's going to pop, and then defenses won't know what to do.\"\nSizing up Heard: OU defensive coordinator Mike Stoops offered his take on Texas quarterback Jerrod Heard, who will make his fifth start Saturday.\n\"His ability to create on his feet, elude pass rushers and run the football, that's a great strength of his right now,\" Stoops said. \"He has a strong arm, obviously working on the drop-back game, but he's a very dynamic player, and he's very unique in his ability to be that quick on his feet.\"\nSmooth Seibert: OU's Austin Seibert is the only FBS true freshman who is handling his team's placekicking and punting duties, according to the Sooners.\nOut of Belleville, Ill., Seibert is 7 for 7 on field goals and has made all 21 extra-point tries.\nSeibert said he took a trip to Dallas this summer and made sure to swing by the Cotton Bowl, the famed site of Saturday's game.\nHis previous experience with a big-time rivalry?\n\"Probably Belleville West and Belleville East,\" he said.\nTwitter: @khairopoulos\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:07:05.699+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
