Marguerite Rudy, of Mi-Wuk Village, was driving a 2005 Subaru Outback north through the parking lot about 2:30 p.m. when she failed to see Joanna Bergstrom, of Sonora, who was walking east from the parking lot toward a store, stated a Sonora Police Department press release. Bergstrom was knocked to the ground after Rudyâ€™s Subaru struck her. Bergstrom sustained moderate injuries but declined medical treatment.
