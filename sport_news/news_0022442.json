It was a real loose dirt, almost like sand and they just made some big mistakes on how they built the surface.\n“Let’s just say it was not a very successful race, unfortunately for me and the Midget series.”\nGordon never even got past the qualifying session when the event was called off because the race cars were throwing up rocks that endangered both fans and drivers alike.\nWhen told that the Ron Fellows, the co-owner of the renamed Canadian Tire Motorsports Park, and his partner Carlo Fidani had bulldozed the oval track last season, Gordon laughed.\n“I’m sure he did,” Gordon said. “It was pretty evident when we were there that it wasn’t going to work like that. It was one of those things that whoever was involved in it just didn’t know enough about what kind of dirt and clay combinations it took to make a good race track.”\nThe CTMP facility did redeem itself in Gordon’s eyes a couple of years later, however, when he attended the then John Powell Corvette Racing School on the famed road course.\nHe credits that experience, ironically, with helping him beat Fellows in the 1999 Frontier @ the Glen NASCAR Sprint Cup race at Watkins Glen International where he finished first and Fellows second in the No. 87 Nemechek Racing Chevrolet.\n“I will tell you that was one of the highlights of my career,” Gordon said. “I knew his skills and his abilities on road courses, especially at the Glen. To compete against him was exciting.\n“Our equipment was probably superior to his and had he been in my No. 24 car he probably would have beat all of us but he was really strong and pushed me the whole way and at that time to win a road course for me was big but to go do it against one of the elite drivers in the world was very special to me.”\nOne of Gordon’s goals as he enters retirement is to help grow the sport beyond the borders of the U.S.A. and he is a big backer of the proposed Canadian Motor Speedway project now being planned in Fort Erie.\nIn fact he has been in on the design of the 7/8ths mile oval right from the start.\nGordon has high hopes that the facility can attract a NASCAR Truck or Xfinity race to Canada.\n“I think the CMP project might even be more than that,” he said. “I can tell you that through my involvement whenever we actually start building it’s going to be first class.\n“It’s going to be great for Canadian fans, Canadian drivers and for NASCAR and that’s why I am excited to be part of it.”\nHe said he has no doubt it will be a success.\n“Any time I have spent in Canada, whether it was with my old sponsor DuPont or for NASCAR, I see that Canadian are avid NASCAR fans and I think they would love to see more of it,” Gordon said.\nFINISH LINES\nKyle Busch is hoping for a change of luck at Kansas Speedway on Sunday. In 15 Cup starts at the track he has no wins, just one top-five finish and four DNFs. Busch pretty much needs a win this time around as he is 10th in the Chase standings, 10 points back of the eighth and final transfer spot to the next round. ... Joey Logano is sounding all grown up. The 25- year-old driver of the No. 2 Team Penske Ford, who has been in the world’s top stock car racing series since he was 18 at Joe Gibbs Racing. On Friday talking about the challenge of starting over again at Penske two seasons ago he said “challenges are opportunities to do something great” and he has done just that with his win last week at Charlotte.\nNO TIME FOR JAYS GAME\nKANSAS CITY — Sarah Cornett-Ching was one of hundreds of Canadians in Kansas City on Friday as the Blue Jays took on the Kansas City Royals in the first game of the American League Championship Series, but she was otherwise occupied when the first pitch was being thrown at Kauffman Stadium.\nShe was behind the wheel of the No. 2 Tim Horton’s Children’s Foundation Chevrolet across town at Kansas Speedway competing in the ARCA Series Full Throttle S’loonshine 98.9.\n“I will be cheering right up to the start of the race,” Cornett-Ching said.\nIt has been an interesting year to say the least for the 24 year-old native of Summerland, B.C.\nJust 12 months ago she was working as a welder in Peace River, B.C., saving money to fuel her real passion — stock car racing.\nA trip to the Race 101 racing school in Denver last year impressed company owner Tony Blanchard so much he signed her to a one-year contract to race in the full 2015 ARCA Series.\nSo far so good for Cornett-Ching, as she has maintained a top-10 points position despite several broken motors that have plagued her this season.\nShe hopes that her results in ARCA will allow her an opportunity in the NASCAR K&N East Series next season as well as the possibility of some starts in the NASCAR Camping World Truck and Xfinity Series.\n“My goal is to race full time in NASCAR,” she said after practice on Friday at Kansas. “It’s my passion.”\nAlong with cheering for the Blue Jays.\nNASCAR'S Jeff Gordon's favourite Canadian memories\nDEAN MCNULTY, POSTMEDIA NETWORK\nFirst posted: Friday, October 16, 2015 07:05 PM EDT | Updated: Friday, October 16, 2015 07:47 PM EDT\nKANSAS CITY — Jeff Gordon’s eyes light up when he is asked about the one and only race he was part of in Canada.\nBut when asked to describe the Midget event at the then Mosport International Speedway half mile oval in July of 1989 he had only one word: Disastrous.\nDisastrous as in awful, bad, terrible and a whole of other similar adjectives.\nGordon, the four-time NASCAR Sprint Cup champion who will retire from racing after this season, said the Midget series was invited up to the newly constructed dirt track north of Bowmanville that was built along side the Mosport Grand Prix road course.\n“I remember we were excited about going up there,” Gordon said in an exclusive interview with The Toronto Sun inside the No. 24 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet transporter at Kansas Speedway on Friday.\n“Back then any time there was a new track that was on the schedule you were excited that you could bring new fans to support a new race track.\nDespite ALCS hole, Blue Jays feel 'pretty good'\n0\nCavs-\nSun Sports\nMets top Arrieta, Cubs to take 2-0 series lead 0", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-17T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:52:46.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
