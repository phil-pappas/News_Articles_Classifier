She said she was still living in the municipality and had a \"promising\" lead on a new residence within the district.\nThe abrupt resignation, she wrote, was necessary \"to prevent hateful, gossipy people from telling my story their way.\"\nOver the last week, two community activists began questioning Christian about her residence, and shared the information with council members and local reporters.\nNorristown's municipal charter requires that the four district council members \"be and remain a resident of the district in which he or she is elected.\"\nCouncilman Marlon Millner, who had an acrimonious relationship with the council president, said that rather than blaming the gossip mill, Christian should have stepped down months ago - when she knew she was no longer qualified for office.\nEven so, Millner said he was sorry to see her go. \"Despite our strong differences, and political battles,\" he said, \"I can say she did care about Norristown, about the third district, and has served the municipality for many years.\"\nCouncilman Derrick Perry said he was \"in shock\" and didn't know anything about Christian's residency until a constituent emailed him Thursday.\nChristian and the activist who allegedly exposed her did not return requests for comment Friday.\nChristian was appointed in 2007, then won elections in 2009 and 2013 to represent the borough's Third District, on the north side of town bordering East Norriton. Term limits would have prevented her from running again.\nCouncil members are paid $4,000 a year, and the president $6,000 a year.\nThe council, by majority vote, must appoint a replacement within 30 days. An election to fill the remainder of her term would be held at the April 26 primary.\njparks@philly.com\n610-313-8117 @JS_Parks\nwww.philly.com/Montco\nMemo", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:11:14.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
