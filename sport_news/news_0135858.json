If we handle them like horses we get horses,” Klopp said Wednesday.\nKlopp was seemingly under the impression the games were played in a five-day span.\n”Rossiter is a special story. I never heard of an 18-year-old playing three games in five days,” Klopp said. ”That is the problem why he is injured and I don’t think he will be ready until the next international break.\n”I don’t know who I have to talk about this but I will find a way because it is not OK. On my first day I didn’t want to have a call with someone with the FA but for sure this is not OK.”\nFirst Published on October 23, 2015 1:32 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:55:47.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
