The Trojans might be the most talented .500 team in college football, however, and despite Utah’s lofty ranking, it is a 3.5-point underdog. To add to the intrigue, Utah Coach Kyle Whittingham is among the names being mentioned for the U.S.C. job . Utah has been getting it done with defense . The Utes are tough upfront against the run and have 13 interceptions on the season. Keep an eye on Utah running back Devontae Booker, a bruising runner who has carried the offensive load . For U.S.C., this game is the last chance to save the season. Cornerback Adoree’ Jackson is one of the most exciting players in college football and will see more time at wide receiver this week .\nNo. 15 Texas A&M at No. 24 Mississippi\n7 p.m., ESPN\nThe only matchup between ranked teams this week also features two teams coming off losses. The Aggies were blown out by Alabama, while Mississippi lost to undefeated Memphis. The winner of this one stays alive in the SEC West, while the loser is basically eliminated. The Rebels’ star left tackle, Laremy Tunsil, will return after serving a seven-game suspension, and his matchup with Aggies defensive end Myles Garrett might be the most compelling of the weekend .\nWashington at No. 10 Stanford\n10:30 p.m., ESPN\nStanford’s offense has clicked, and the team is suddenly among the hottest in the game. The offensive line has been tremendous, and running back Christian McCaffrey has been unstoppable over his last four games. Last week, he racked up 369 all-purpose yards and four touchdowns in a victory over U.C.L.A. He leads the nation in all-purpose yards and is making the case to be included in the Heisman discussion. The Cardinal offense will be put to the test against a Washington defense that is allowing 16.8 points a game, fewest in the conference.\nNo. 6 Clemson at Miami\nNoon, ABC\nThis one has all the signs of a trap game for Clemson. It is the first real test on the road for the Tigers this season. Their only other trip away from Death Valley resulted in a narrow victory over a Louisville team that is now 2-4. Clemson is in the thick of the playoff hunt, but everyone seems to be waiting for it to slip up . Miami has done a great job forcing turnovers on defense and taking care of the ball on offense. This game features two great quarterbacks, Clemson’s Deshaun Watson and Miami’s Brad Kaaya.\nNo. 25 Pittsburgh at Syracuse\nNoon, ESPNU\nIn his first season as coach, Pat Narduzzi (the former Michigan State defensive coordinator) has the Panthers at 5-1 and in the top 25 for the first time in five years. Their one loss came on the road to an undefeated Iowa team, which needed a 57-yard field goal as time expired for the win.\nNo. 1 Ohio State at Rutgers\n8 p.m., ABC\nHow many 7-0 teams change starting quarterbacks? That’s what Ohio State has done, with Cardale Jones being replaced by J.T. Barrett . The speedy Barrett has looked great lately and has been getting the Buckeyes into the end zone, which was something they were struggling to do.\nNo. 21 Houston at Central Florida\nNoon, ESPN News\nThe Cougars are undefeated, and quarterback Greg Ward Jr. is among the best playmakers in college football. His 14 rushing touchdowns are tied with Leonard Fournette for most in the F.B.S. Winless Central Florida is unlikely to pose much of a threat.\nTennessee at No. 8 Alabama\n3:30 p.m., CBS\nThe Tide are rolling, having beaten two top 10 teams on the road over their last three games. Since a loss to Mississippi, the Tide defense has been lights out, and the team is playing as well as anyone else in the country.\nLoading...
