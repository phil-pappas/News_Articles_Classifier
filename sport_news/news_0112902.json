Posted: Thursday, October 22, 2015 10:20 pm Tigers cruise past Titans into semis By Rick Teverbaugh | The Herald Bulletin Herald Bulletin Posted on Oct 22, 2015 by Rick Teverbaugh \nALEXANDRIA â€” The Alexandria Tigers took control of their volleyball sectional match against the Taylor Titans early and never let up here Thursday night. \nThe No. 1-ranked Tigers stopped their foe 25-12, 25-13, 25-8 and the scores might have been worse had the home team used all of its weapons to their full extent. \n\"We wanted to go to some people who are sometimes shaky for us,\" said Alexandria coach Jeff Harmon. \"I thought those people played very well tonight.\" \nWhile the Tigers went to different sources of points on offense, the Alexandria defense was nearly airtight. For the three sets, Taylor had four kills, none of them coming in the third set. \nIn each of the matches Alex raced to double digit leads and then seemed to level off. The Titans finished the season at 2-24. \n\"We didn't talk to our girls about their record coming in,\" said Harmon. \"But once the match started they could tell that Taylor wasn't very good.\" \nThe first set featured four kills and a block from Megan Miller and a pair of kills from Makayla Alberts and Blaine Kelly. In the second set Alberts had two more kills and a pair of blocks to go with Miller's four kills. Mackenzie McCarty added two more kills. \nIn the final set, after Miller and Kelly got things underway, Regan Lundy had a pair of kills to notch two of the team's final five points. \nThere was one thing that didn't please the coach. \"We had too many service errors,\" said Harmon. \"We need to clean that up.\" The Tigers gave up 14 points on service errors to account for over a third of the Titans' points. \nNext up for the Tigers will be Elwood at 11 a.m. on Saturday. \"They will be better (than Taylor),\" said Harmon. \"Tonight the pace was slow. But we know it will be quicker against Elwood.\" \nThe Tigers also know this season's biggest rival, the Madison-Grant Argylls, won't play until Saturday at about 12:30 p.m. against Eastbrook. A potential fourth matchup of the season between Alexandria and Madison-Grant could be in the works for the sectional title game. \nSaturday's championship match will be played at 7 p.m.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:44:34.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
