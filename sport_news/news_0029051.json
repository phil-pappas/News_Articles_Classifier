I’m just concerned that the temporary fix may not be good enough for him to perform. It’s probably another week until we know about that. \n“(Returning Oct. 24) would probably be a stretch. I’m not going to tell you he’s not, I’m not going to tell you he is. Again, I’m not a doctor. I guess it could turn tomorrow. It’s just moving a little slower than probably we would’ve hoped.” \nConner underwent surgery Sept. 22 to repair a torn meniscus in his right knee, an injury he suffered in the Rebels’ 43-37 win against Alabama. He was expected to miss a minimum of four games, which would’ve allowed him to return for next week’s home game against Texas A&M. \nRebels linebacker C.J. Johnson also underwent surgery to repair a torn meniscus and was projected to miss between four and six weeks. \nBut with Freeze describing Conner’s surgery as a “temporary fix,” Conner may need a second round of surgery after the season that would keep him out longer, should he return this year. \nThe Rebels started sophomore A.J. Moore for two games at Conner’s position before moving Mike Hilton there due to Moore’s performance. Hilton’s move caused them to rearrange their safeties, moving Elston to Hilton’s old spot and inserting C.J. Hampton at free safety. \nConner recorded 10 tackles (1.5 for a loss) in three starts this season. ESPN’s Mel Kiper Jr. projected the junior as a first-round selection in next year’s NFL Draft. \nContact Daniel Paulling at dpaulling@jackson.gannett.com.
