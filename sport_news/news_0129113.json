Three died at the scene and the fourth died three years later. The fifth man survived his wounds.\nThe justices said in a 53-page decision that the judge hearing the case did not adequately cite reasons why anti-psychotic medication should be forced on Warren. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.\nThe justices said Warren’s mental and physical condition could have changed since the June 2014 hearing that resulted in the order to forcibly medicate him.\nState doctors had said they were reluctant to give Warren certain medications because of the physical dangers they posed to him because of his age — in his mid 60s — and his other physical ailments, including high blood pressure.\n“If the State elects to pursue its motion for involuntary medication on remand, the trial court should allow the parties to present additional evidence to ensure that the court’s findings are based on current circumstances,” the opinion said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T16:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:47:59.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
