The game's only two scores occurred in the first half and the Ospreys took the initial lead in the 26 th minute. The Ospreys were awarded a free kick in the middle of the field about 35 yards from the goal. Distance wasn't the issue for Solstad as he fired a missile into the top corner of the net. The goal was the second of the season and he now is the team leader with eight points. The lead for the Ospreys was short-lived as the Eagles were awarded a penalty kick in the box a little over two minutes later. The foul warranted a yellow card issued to Solstad and proved crucial later in the game. FGCU's Albert Ruiz converted the PK for his second goal of the season. FGCU was able to create some chances in the second half including two, well-placed crosses that ended with a pair of headers sailing over top the net. The Ospreys on the other hand thought they put in the go-ahead goal a little under 10 minutes into the second half on another Solstad free kick. This time Solstad's intention appeard to be to cross it across the box but the ball sailed all the way to the back post and one-hopped into the net. The goal was taken off the board after a foul on North Florida was called during the battle in the box. The game quickly changed tones in the 71 st minute when Solstad was called for a foul and issued his second yellow card of the game, an automatic disqualification. The Ospreys played the final 29 minutes of regulation and the 20 minutes of overtime a man down. A total of seven cards were shown in the contest, five of them on the Eagles. \"I'm proud of the guys because went we went down a man, we organized ourselves and got into good shape and in those situations you want to play for set pieces and not concede a goal, which we were able to do.\" Kyle Nasta made a tremendous finger-tip save to keep the Eagles off the scoreboard. A few minutes later, the Ospreys were presented with their best chance of the extra sessions when Josh Castellanos' header just went over the cross bar on a beautiful cross. Nasta was credited with five saves on the night, tying a season-high. The senior now has 133 career saves and only trails Andrew Calise by four on the program's D-1 era career saves list. The Ospreys were the first team to score on FGCU goalkeerp Nathan Ingham since September 25 th . Ingham was coming off back-to-back, shutouts over Stetson and Jacksonville. North Florida will continue Atlantic Sun Conference play this Saturday when they take on Stetson. Game time is set for 7:00 p.m. at Hodges Stadium.
