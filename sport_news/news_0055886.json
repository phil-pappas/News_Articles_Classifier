This time the one from 25 yards out was no good. \nTwo the next three Tide possessions ended in Arkansas turnovers. The first one came when Josh Liddell intercepted Jake Coker. The Razorbacks couldn't do anything with that drive and had to punt it back to Bama. With under five minutes in the half, Coker's cannon got him in trouble again. Santos Ramirez jumped up for the pass at the Alabama 42-yard line. He returned it for 18 yards and then the Crimson Tide got called for unsportsmanlike conduct, putting the Hogs on the 12-yard line. This time, Brandon Allen came through for his defense, finding a wide open Drew Morgan to give Arkansas the lead at 7-3. \nNick Saban gave Griffith a chance to shrink the gap before the half, but the 48-yard attempt missed wide right. \nArkansas went into the half leading by four. \nThe second half saw more of the same from two defenses that weren't willing to give up a yard without a fight. \nWith a little under two minutes to go in the third, Coker found a hole in the Arkansas secondary. He hit a wide open Calvin Ridley for the 81-yard touchdown to put Bama up 10-7. \nThe Hogs offense couldn't find any firepower during their possession so the Tide got it back on Arkansas' 43-yard line. \nFrom there, it was almost all Alabama, they add another two touchdowns and a field goal to make it 27-7. \nAllen finds Reed with 1:37 left in the fourth for a long touchdown to make it 27-14, but it was too little too late for the Hogs to pull off the upset. \nNo. 8 Crimson Tide win their homecoming game, 27-14.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:01:58.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
