Greinke entered the game with a 43 2/3 inning scoreless streak, but deGrom himself snapped it with an run-scoring groundout in the third inning.\nPLUS : Clayton Kershaw on Zack Greinke vs. Jacob deGrom\nIn the end, deGrom also bested Greinke on the mound , firing 7 1/3 scoreless innings while walking two and striking out eight. DeGrom allowed just two hits — a single to Greinke in the third and another single to Andre Ethier in the fifth.\nGreinke, meanwhile, gave up two runs on four hits over seven innings.\nNeither pitcher received a decision in the game, but the Mets went on to win, 3-2, thanks to Juan Uribe's walk-off RBI single in the bottom of the 10th inning .\nWill deGrom be able to upstage Greinke again on Thursday?
