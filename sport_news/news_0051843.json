The Patriots (8-0) took a 55-23 win over the visiting Green Wave (2-6) at Bagwell Stadium in the Region 8-AAAA opener for both teams. Fort Dorchester, ranked No. 4 in the state, took leads of 35-7 lead at the half and 49-17 lead into the final quarter. The meetings between the two teams have grown into one of the area’s most heated rivalries. Summerville dominated the series for sometime until the tide turned on the Green Wave last seasonm when Fort Dorchester earned two victories over Summerville. The Green Wave now leads the series 21-5. Friday’s game featured turnovers by and penalties on both teams. “As kids get real emotional, sometimes you don’t play as well,” Fort Dorchester coach Steve LaPrad said. “I was hoping ours would play a little better but we still did good. They are going to play as hard as they can against us and I knew they were going to give us their best shot, so to put up 55 on them isn’t bad.” Fort Dorchester quarterback Dakereon Joyner continues to impress. The sophomore completed three touchdown passes and rushed for two more TDs. Senior receiver Diondre Champaigne made scoring receptions of 60 and 10 yards. Senior running back Datron James added two late TDs on runs of three and eight yards. Joyner opened the scoring with a 10-yard touchdown run. After the Patriots’ defense made a stop, the QB hit a wide-open Champaigne for big gain and the receiver used his speed to complete a 60-yard TD play. A 40-yard punt return late in the second quarter helped set up a 3-yard Joyner run into the end zone. Then linebacker Derrick Ringlen recovered a Summerville fumble on the ensuing kickoff return to set up the score that shifted momentum to the Patriots for good. Joyner connected with junior receiver Adonicas Sanders for a 7-yard touchdown for a 28-0 Patriots lead. Sanders also had some big kick returns in the game. Lineman Michael Brown recovered a fumble and returned it 54 yards into the end zone before Summerville even got on the board. Summerville finally reached the end zone on a 9-yard run by QB Jonathan Bennett in the final minute of the second quarter. In the second half, Summerville scored on a 6-yard pass from Bennett to Krishaon Jackson, a 37-yard field goal by Garrett Quackenbush and a 36-yard run by Dallas White that cut the Patriot lead to 49-23 on the first play of the fourth quarter. Fort Dorchester’s second-half scores came on a 10-yard pass to Champaigne and the two scoring runs by James.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:49:53.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
