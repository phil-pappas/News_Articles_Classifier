The animals were suffering, behind a home in Bogalusa.\n\"Dogs tied to trees for years, dogs malnourished. Cats in small containers outside for years,\" said Jeff Dorson of the Humane Society of Louisiana.\n\"A lot of these animals have suffered enough.. they were showing visible signs..body sores, hair loss, tumors,\" he said.\nDorson says to treat all the animals could take at least $10,000. He is asking for the public's help as they try nurse them back to health.\nThe women were not arrested but have been summoned to court.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
