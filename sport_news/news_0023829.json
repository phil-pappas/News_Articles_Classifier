It set the tone for the Grizzlies' 38-14 victory over King's Fork in a battle of top 10 teams Friday night.\nThe victory leaves ninth-ranked Grassfield (6-1) tied with Indian River for second place in the Southeastern.\n\"That opening play was huge,\" Grassfield coach Martin Asprey said.\nIt helped the Grizzlies that No. 7 King's Fork was without coach Joe Jones and running back Deshaun Wethington. Both were suspended for a game after being ejected in the fourth quarter last week against Lakeland.\nWethington had missed the season opener, but still has run for 983 yards and 11 touchdowns on 111 carries this season. He is the No. 2 all-time regular-season rusher in South Hampton Roads with 4,589 yards.\n\"He's a special running back,\" Asprey said. \"But we knew his backup was pretty good, too.\"\nSophomore Darran Butts stepped in admirably for the Bulldogs, picking up 145 yards and a touchdown on 22 carries.\nBut Grassfield had simply too many weapons - led by Holloway, who scores about 30 percent of every time he touches the ball. Leading 14-7 near the end of the first quarter, Bigbie ran the same play, resulting in a 77-yard catch- and-run score for Holloway.\nHolloway finished with 148 yards on five catches. He rushed once on an end-around for 16 yards that had King's Fork defensive coordinator Dave Waddell shaking his head and telling his assistants: \"Man, that kid is fast.\"\nGrassfield's quarterback also understands what an asset a player like Grant can be.\n\"We could probably give it to him every time. He's incredible,\" said Bigbie, who finished with 194 yards and two touchdowns on 10-of-21 passing with no interceptions. \"Having a guy like him helps a ton.\"\nBut the Grizzlies were far from one-dimensional.\nShawndell Joyner and ShaJuan Goodman each finished with 72 yards and a touchdown.\nGrassfield led 28-14 at halftime and held the Bulldogs (5-2) scoreless in the second half.\nLee Tolliver, 757-222-5844,\nlee.tolliver@pilotonline.com\nTwitter: @LeeTolliver\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image.
