Barrett and Cardale Jones were successful during the 2014 season. \nJones has been the starter so far this season but Barrett has been involved more and more. \nIn Saturday night’s game, Barrett threw for two scores and ran for over 100 yards with two touchdowns on the ground. \nJones was only 9-15 for 84 yards. \nMeyer said that nothing would be announced Monday because he hasn’t had a chance to sit down with the quarterback to formally review everything. \n“We’re just behind because of the night game…there’s a lot of things going on,” he said. “I have an idea but I want to make sure I visit with everybody and make sure we’re doing the right thing.” \nWhen asked if the offense was running better with Barrett currently, he replied that it was doing better against Penn State. \nMeyer added that anytime there’s a change at a position it’s a delicate decision especially with the quarterback spot. \n“Someone made the comment ‘Do you really care who plays at quarterback’ the other day and absolutely we care,” he said. “It’s not number 16 and 12, those are people that we care about deeply and we’re not ashamed to say that.” \nThe Buckeyes are back on the road this weekend as they will travel to Piscataway, N.J. to face Rutgers Saturday at 8 p.m. ©2015 by 10TV.com.
