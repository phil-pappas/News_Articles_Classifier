The Eagles end the first part of the regular season with a record of 6-1 and they should be one of the top seeds in the Division 3 Southeast playoff bracket. Silver Lake (1-6) will have its next three games arranged by the MIAA scheduling committee. Plymouth North got on the scoreboard a little over three minutes into the game. Myles Uva (three touchdowns) took a handoff from Cam Drew and went around left end and down the sideline for a 62 yard score. Aaron Chase kicked the PAT to put the Eagles on top 7-0. Uva struck again a couple minutes later, following a blocker through the line for a 33-yard score to make it a 14-0 contest. Silver Lake scored in the final minute of the first quarter when Alec Snell found his brother, Carson, open in the corner of the end zone for a touchdown for a 17-yard scoring strike. The kick missed, leaving the score at 14-6. Plymouth North was right back on the scoreboard on its next possession when Drew hit Colin Nicklas with a pass over the middle and he snaked his way 33 yards to the end zone. The kick was blocked and the Eagles were ahead 20-6. Drew struck again on the next possession, leading Spencer Potter perfectly on a 63-yard pass right down the middle of the field to make it a 27-6 contest with five minutes left in the half. Plymouth North was not done as Drew made it TD passes on three straight possessions when he hit Uva with a short pass in the flat and he proceeded to twist and turn his way to a 67-yard touchdown reception. Chases' PAT made it a 34-6 game late in the first half. Plymouth North went back to the ground game in the third quarter as Jake Burkhead broke free for a 67 yard TD run that extended the lead to 41-6 with 2:30 still left in the third quarter. Silver Lake's Phil Lashley added a 27-yard scoring run with 6:33 left and Matt Haite's PAT made the final score 41-13.
