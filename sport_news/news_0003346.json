According to Stoehlker, Blatter commented that \"I don't know anything about this case.\"\nBeckenbauer himself has remained silent since the case broke out one week ago and cancelled a planned appearance at the opening the of the German football museum Friday attended by Niersbach and other DFB officials. His management said Thursday that Beckenbauer would be available to answer questions from a law firm hired by DFB to investigate the affair.\nConsidered one of the best players of his generation, Beckenbauer won the World Cup both as captain and coach of West Germany. His international popularity and connections were thought to have a played a major role in bringing the World Cup to Germany. He toured the world to present Germany's bid.\nZwanziger was responsible for finances for the 2006 World Cup organizing committee. He and Niersbach have had several bitter feuds over the years.\nOn Thursday, Niersbach told a news conference that the payment to FIFA was in return for a financial grant of 250 million Swiss francs to the 2006 World Cup organizing committee. Niersbach said Blatter and Beckenbauer made the deal at a private meeting and that the money was paid to FIFA by French businessman chief Robert Louis-Dreyfus.\nLouis-Dreyfus, the former Adidas chief who died in 2009, demanded the repayment of the loan and was paid back by the Germans one year before the tournament.\nBut Zwanziger, in his comments to Spiegel, claimed the money in fact went to Mohamed Bin Hammam, the now disgraced former member of FIFA's executive committee from Qatar, who at the time was supporting Blatter's re-election bid.\nZwanziger said he had learned about this through a telephone conversation this week with Horst R. Schmidt, who was the vice president of the 2006 organizing committee. Zwanziger did not say why the money went to Bin Hammam.\nAlso Friday, the DFB board stood behind Niersbach after a regular meeting, while demanding a full explanation of the case regardless of who might be involved and even if the truth leads to \"painful findings,\" according Reinhard Rauball, a vice-president of the federation.\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
