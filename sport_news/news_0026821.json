But first, Adams has to wait for his right knee to completely heal.\nAdams' participation in training camp has been limited as he continues to rehab from minor offseason surgery to repair meniscus in the knee. He hasn't lost confidence — just an early opportunity to compete for playing time during the first quarter of the regular season.\n\"It's tough because I was looking forward to getting some run and a lot of action in the preseason,\" said Adams, who suffered the injury during a summer workout. \"But I'm about a week away just as a precaution. It's a long season. They want to make sure I'm 100 percent and that there won't be any setbacks during the season.\"\nIt's difficult to view Adams' training camp as anything but a setback for the Grizzlies' first-round draft pick (22nd overall) in 2014. He mostly played last season with the Grizzlies' NBA Development League affiliate, Iowa Energy. This was supposed to be a time when Griz coach Dave Joerger could extensively evaluate the 21-year-old.\nAdams didn't figure to be in the rotation to start the season with a host of veterans ahead of him at shooting guard and small forward. However, Joerger hoped to further Adams' development with an eye on inserting the former UCLA standout if and when the Griz might need a spark on any given night.\n\"You're looking at the calendar of when we can get him back and the train is moving,\" Joerger said. \"I feel terrible for him. He had a good summer. He worked hard. He's chomping at the bit for an opportunity. But we're encouraged. His time will come.\"\nAdams insists that he's on schedule following the surgery. He participated in the Grizzlies' first training camp practice at the University of California, Santa Barbara. However, Adams mostly rode a stationary bike the rest of the week.\nHis return to action has been slow and deliberate.\n\"Nothing happened out there,\" Adams said. \"I didn't want to play because I wasn't 100 percent. It felt a little funny so before anything happened, I just sat back and chilled.\"\nAdams, who is known more for his skill set than his athleticism, hardly played as a rookie. He appeared in 30 games, mostly at a time when the Griz faced large deficits.\nJoerger often played former Griz guard Nick Calathes (now in Greece) ahead of Adams when 38-year-old Vince Carter went down for six weeks with a foot injury. Joerger's rationale was that using Calathes put another playmaker on the floor.\nStill, there always has been and still remains great optimism about Adams' game. He not only shot 40 percent from 3-point range but his active hands on defense were also on display whenever he played.\nThe organization is as adamant about increasing versatility as it is in promoting two-way players like Adams.\n\"You just tell him to keep depositing your work in your piggy bank because you don't know what's going to happen a year from now,\" Joerger said. \"You don't know what's going to happen the next three months with injuries. And you look at the contract status of our wings and how many guys we're able to bring back. You just don't know. You could go from zero to 60 real fast.\"\nGriz first in affordability\nThe Griz finished second overall among the 122 teams in the four major North American professional sports leagues (MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL) in ESPN The Magazine's 2015 Ultimate Standings.\nA breakdown of the categories considered in the ranking revealed that Memphis topped all teams in affordability for the second straight year and ranked third overall in \"bang for the buck,\" fourth in players, sixth in stadium experience, seventh in fan relations and 13th in ownership.\nAffordability measured the price of tickets, parking and concessions. \"Bang for the buck\" calculated wins in the past two years per fan dollar, adjusted for league schedules. The players' category quantified the Grizzlies' effort on the court and likability off it. Stadium experience assessed the quality of arena and game-day promotions as well as the friendliness of the environment.\nFan relations examined courtesy by players, coaches and the front office toward fans, plus how well a team uses technology to reach fans. Ownership measured honesty and loyalty to core players and the local community.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:43:01.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
