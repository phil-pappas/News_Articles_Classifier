Triple Crown champion American Pharoah will try to close out his career in style by winning the $5 million Breeders’ Cup Classic next week against a loaded field that includes two-time Breeders’ Cup-winning mare Beholder and Keen Ice, who handed him his only loss this year in the Travers.\nTonalist, the 2014 Belmont Stakes winner, and Frosted, who pressed American Pharoah much of the way in the Travers before finishing third, are also among the 10 horses expected to run in the 1 1/4-mile Classic, which will be shown live on NBC.\n\"It’s some good horses in there,\" said Bob Baffert, who trains American Pharoah, \"but that’s what the Breeders’ Cup is supposed to be. It’s supposed to be tough.\"\nAmerican Pharoah is owned by Ahmed Zayat of Teaneck.\nThe Classic field is among a total of 200 horses — one less than last year’s record — which were pre-entered Wednesday for the $26 million, 13-race Breeders’ Cup world championships being held for the first time at Keeneland, which is in Lexington, Ky., on Oct. 30 and 31.\nNew York-based trainer Chad Brown pre-entered a leading 14 horses in the two-day event. Coolmore had 10 horses pre-entered, tops among owners.\nFinal entries and the post-position draw will be Monday at Keeneland. Thirty-two foreign horses were pre-entered.\nAmerican Pharoah will attempt to become the first horse to sweep the Triple Crown and the Classic in the same year. The 3-year-old colt is expected to make his final start at the track before being retired to stud.\nAmerican Pharoah will tackle older horses for the first time in his career, with 5-year-old mare Beholder looming as the toughest challenger. She’s won all five of her starts this year, including dominating the $1 million Pacific Classic over male horses at Del Mar.\n\"I feel confident I have him at that level that he’s going to run a big race,\" Baffert said.\nAmerican Pharoah is set to work once more at his home base of Santa Anita (Calif.) on Monday before traveling to Kentucky the next day.\nBeholder could become the first horse to win three different BC races and the first female to win the Classic since Zenyatta in 2009. She won the 2012 Juvenile Fillies and the 2013 Distaff.\nBeholder was also entered in this year’s Distaff, but trainer Richard Mandella said he intends to run her against the boys in the Classic.\nThe mare was doing better Wednesday after developing a temperature while traveling to Keeneland on Monday.\n\"She was really tense on the flight,\" Mandella said. \"I think that’s what triggered it. With a little treatment, she’s doing great.\"\nThe Classic offers a rematch between American Pharoah and Keen Ice, who rallied to catch the first Triple Crown winner in 37 years in deep stretch in the Travers.\nFrosted gets another shot at American Pharoah, too. Frosted, who was fourth in the Kentucky Derby and second in the Belmont and third in the Travers, is coming off a two-length victory in the Pennsylvania Derby on Sept. 19.\n\"It’s a tough, tough race with American Pharoah and Beholder,\" said Kiaran McLaughlin, who trains Frosted.\nAlso pre-entered in the Classic were English and Irish Guineas winner Gleneagles; Whitney winner Honor Code; Gold Cup winner Hard Aces; Smooth Roller; and Suburban Handicap winner Effinex.\nThe top race Oct. 30 is the $2 million Distaff for fillies and mares. Sixteen horses were pre-entered — two more than the limit.\nDefending champion Untapable, who is 1 for 5 this year, will take on Sheer Drama, Wedding Toast, Got Lucky and Stopcharging Maria among other horses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:00:53.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
