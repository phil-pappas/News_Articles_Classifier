Photo by Allen Sharpe × The University of South Carolina made a tough, agonizing decision this week to move its Saturday football game from Columbia to Baton Rouge. It was a prudent, noble call considering all the flooding and recovery efforts in the Palmetto State. Thanks to the city of Baton Rouge for its welcome mat for the Gamecocks and their fans. Louisianans are good-hearted people from a state that knows recent natural disasters like no other state. Gamecock Nation surely appreciates all the goodwill gestures: - “Geaux Gamecocks; Make Yourself at Home!” billboards. - The LSU band plan to play to South Carolina fight song before the game. - A pre-game “Sandstorm” blast over the PA system. - Ticket proceeds sent to South Carolina. But it all rings hollow, LSU, without the truly right thing to do: Commit on Saturday to giving Columbia the 2020 South Carolina-LSU game scheduled for Baton Rouge. Otherwise, everything else comes off as a bit patronizing for a team that’s nearly a three-touchdown favorite. What Columbia – hotels, restaurants, businesses, stadium vendors – really needs is revenue lost from a suddenly moved home game. The impact this weekend is much greater than losses suffered in Baton Rouge when LSU’s 2015 home opener against McNeese State was cancelled just before kickoff because of bad weather; the cash was in the barn by then. The Columbia business community surely will accept a 2015 rain check for 2020. C’mon, LSU. No need for 2020 hindsight on this one. Bet the good people of Columbia will even put up “Geaux Tigers” billboards along George Rogers Boulevard get the South Carolina band to learn the LSU fight song to make you feel right at home.
