The other player is a senior. \nMack Breed, the assistant coach accused of ordering the players to take down the referee, testified in front of the committee for the first time on Thursday. He said he made a comment on the field that referee Robert Watts should \"pay the price\" for allegedly making a racial slur toward a player. He said he believes that comment was taken out of context by his players. \n\"How many coaches have said to their players, 'Get out there and kill them?' or 'Get out there and knock their heads off'?\" Breed said. \"I don't think any of you believe coaches are literally asking their players to hurt people.\" \nBreed said that after the game, he confided in another coach that he believed the attack was result of the comment he made. He ended up resigning from his position after initially taking blame for the attack. He said Thursday that he would take a bullet for his players. \nBreed teared up as he tried to convince the committee why he should coach again and said he needs to bring his temper under control. \n\"My dad has been coaching a long time and he knows how intense I am, my style of coaching, and he has always told me I don't need to be that way,\" Breed said. \nAfter hearing his testimony, committee members agreed that he was sincere. Instead of giving him a maximum three-year coaching suspension, they suspended him for the rest of the 2015-16 school year. He also faces a two-year probation and a public reprimand. \nWatts also testified before the committee, denying that he made any racial slurs during the game. \n\"I've officiated over 450 games in the state of Texas, and I've never had any issue at all,\" Watts said. \nMembers of the Texas Association of Sports Officials testified that so far they have found no evidence that Watts used a racial slur during the game. \nWatts also told committee members that he is still suffering physically from getting knocked down on the field. He has said he has post-concussion syndrome and anxiety disorder. \nVideo from the game shows the two John Jay High School players lining up behind Watts and then blindsiding him from behind after the snap. \nAttorney Jay Downs said one of the false accusations being circulated is that Watts said \"speak English, this is America\" while John Jay players were talking to each other. \nLast month, Downs gave the UIL committee two family photos. One shows Watts at his wedding with his best man, who is black, and another is of Watts' grandmother, who is from Mexico. \nJohn Jay High School head coach Gary Gutierrez was also punished by the UIL committee, which includes a public reprimand and two years of probation. \nIt is unclear if Watts will eventually face any sort of punishment. \nCopyright 2015 by Click2Houston.com.
