Share This Story Email Comment \nJohnny “Red” Floyd is the century-old tie that binds Middle Tennessee State and Vanderbilt football, yet neither side knows much about that connection. \nFloyd played at both schools from 1914 to 1920, transferring three times and playing a combined six seasons over seven years. He originally was pulled away from MTSU by a crafty recruiting move by legendary Vanderbilt coach Dan McGugin. \nFloyd coached an undefeated team at MTSU between playing seasons at Vanderbilt while both schools sent their finest off to World War I. And, in the 1930s, Floyd returned to MTSU to become the first great football coach in the university’s history. \nOn Saturday, Vanderbilt will play MTSU for the first time at Johnny “Red” Floyd Stadium, the facility that bears the name of their shared gridiron great. \nJohnny \"Red\" Floyd Stadium is named after MTSU's first great football coach, who also played and coached at Vanderbilt. (Photo: J. Intintoli / MTSU) \nIt’s actually the first time since 1920 that Vanderbilt will play in Murfreesboro. That year, the Commodores won 34-0, thanks in part to Floyd, their red-headed halfback and team captain. \n“Most people are just not aware of the many athletic connections between Middle Tennessee and Vanderbilt, particularly in football,” MTSU varsity club director Jim Simpson said. “Our stadium’s namesake, Johnny 'Red' Floyd, is one of the big ones ever since he was recruited away back in our earliest years. But most people just don’t know he’s connected to both universities.” \nIn the MTSU Hall of Fame building, just feet from the stadium that bears his name, the mural of Floyd says he is “counted among the elite of MT athletes, alumni and coaches” in the school’s history. \nAnd in Vanderbilt’s lesser-known archives, Floyd was called “one of the cleanest and most respected gridiron warriors that ever performed on Dudley Field” for the Commodores nearly a century ago. Who was “Red” Floyd Sports, football in particular, were a source of strength for Floyd. \nFloyd was born in 1891 just outside Murfreesboro on Franklin Road in a farming family of eight children. His mother died of tuberculosis when he was 6. His father, a local magistrate nicknamed “Squire” Floyd, remarried, starting a cycle in which “Red” and his siblings bounced between households of nearby family members. But sports, particularly football, were a source of strength for the barrel-chested Floyd. \nIn 1914, he enrolled at State Teachers College, a modest three-year-old institution, that later became Middle Tennessee State University. \nFloyd played in a 0-0 tie at Cumberland in the 1914 season opener. It was MTSU’s only partial blemish that season en route to a 5-0-1 record under coach Alfred Miles, and it was Floyd’s last season there for a while. \nIn the second game of the year with Floyd playing, MTSU beat Vanderbilt’s “B” team 9-6 in a game recorded in the Blue Raiders media guide but not the Commodores’ record book. \nMcGugin made the trip to Murfreesboro on that fall afternoon in 1914 to see his younger players match up with MTSU’s varsity squad. Amid his only losing season of a 30-year coaching career, McGugin kept his eyes peeled on Floyd, a stocky, hard-running halfback. After the game, it didn’t take long for McGugin to convince “Red” to come to Vanderbilt, where he studied law but never practiced it — opting instead to stay in football his whole life. \nVanderbilt coach Dan McGugin, standing, was amid his only losing season in 30 years when he snagged Johnny \"Red\" Floyd from MTSU. Floyd was McGugin's team captain in 1920. (Photo: Vanderbilt) \nIt was somewhat common in those days for players to jump from one school to another and play beyond four seasons of modern-era eligibility. \nThe Vanderbilt coach’s grandson, George McGugin, said he had heard of Floyd, but knew nothing of his grandfather’s maneuvers to get him to West End. \n“Am I familiar with his name and that Johnny ‘Red’ Floyd played for my granddad? Yes,” said George McGugin, a former Vanderbilt player who lives in Nashville. “But did I know the story of how he got to Vanderbilt? No. But I will say it’s very interesting how things happened like that back in those early days.” Big play man at Vandy Floyd single-handedly led the team to victory over Auburn in 1916. \nFloyd played on Vanderbilt’s famed “point-a-minute” team in 1915, a season that started with a 51-0 win over MTSU. \nJohnny \"Red\" Floyd poses for a photo in 1920 Vanderbilt yearbook as part of the 1919 squad. (Photo: Vanderbilt) \nHis signature moment came in 1916 when he “single-handed beat Auburn in the last three minutes of play” in a 20-9 victory, according to a 1921 Vanderbilt yearbook listing his feats. \nOn Oct. 30, 1915, Floyd rushed for 47 yards in the third quarter as part of a four-man halfback rotation that buried Tennessee 35-0, as told in Fred Russell’s book, “Fifty Years of Vanderbilt Football.” \nIn that Tennessee game, Floyd’s teammate, Bennett Jared, suffered a spine injury that killed him a few months later. And one of Floyd’s closest friends, All-American quarterback “Rabbit” Curry, was later killed in combat as a pilot in World War I. \nFloyd tried to follow his Vanderbilt and former MTSU teammates into the war, driving to Atlanta with some classmates to enlist in the Army. But when he attempted to enlist, the Army turned him down because he tested positive for the same tuberculosis that killed his mother. Floyd lived his whole life with a positive test, but never actually contracted the disease. Back to MTSU once again MTSU’s 1918 season was put on hold until the war ended, and Floyd ultimately returned to Vanderbilt. \nIn 1917, Floyd returned to MTSU, where the teacher’s college had been trimmed as male students enlisted in the military. Starved of young men to play football, MTSU kept the team going with Floyd both playing and coaching. The squad posted a 7-0 record and outscored opponents 201-0. It beat Vanderbilt’s “B” team 13-0, thanks to dominant players like “Putty” Overall — who later followed Floyd back to Vanderbilt and ultimately coached Tennessee Tech football, basketball and baseball teams for decades. \nVanderbilt quarterback Jess Neely, right, played with Johnny \"Red\" Floyd at MTSU in 1917 and then excelled at Vanderbilt. (Photo: Vanderbilt) \n“There are all kinds of those stories and connections between the schools,” Simpson said. “Most people don’t know that (former Vanderbilt player and administrator) Jess Neely also played at Middle Tennessee that year (in 1917). Back in those days, all those guys knew each other and played together.” \nMTSU’s 1918 season was put on hold until the war ended, and Floyd ultimately returned to Vanderbilt to lead two more strong teams as a player under McGugin in 1919 and 1920. \nA Vanderbilt yearbook credits Floyd’s defensive play as the driving force in a pivotal 16-12 comeback win over Alabama in 1919. And that next season, Floyd served as team captain for the squad — or as Vanderbilt’s yearbook called him, “the sorrel-topped pilot of the Commodores … (with) a never-say-die spirit.” \nFloyd bounced around Tennessee as a high school teacher until briefly returning to Vanderbilt as McGugin’s assistant coach in 1927 and then serving as an assistant at Auburn. \nAfter the head coach was fired midseason, Floyd was named Auburn’s interim head coach, but he had an ominous start. His first practice was likely on Oct. 28, 1929 — Black Monday — the start of the stock market crash that birthed The Great Depression. \nAfter an 0-4 record at Auburn and then a stint at The Citadel, Floyd came back to Murfreesboro to revive an MTSU football team that had suffered three straight losing seasons. \nJohnny \"Red\" Floyd poses in an MTSU yearbook. Floyd briefly played at MTSU and later served as the school's first great football coach. (Photo: MTSU) \nHis return drew more than 4,000 fans, a record crowd at the time, for a 13-6 comeback win over Cumberland in the 1935 opener, and attendance grew to 6,000 for a 7-0 win over Western Kentucky that October. \nThe newly named Blue Raiders went 8-0 in that 1935 season to claim the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) title, the school’s first-ever football championship. \nFloyd’s offense aired it out more than most teams of the time. Seven of MTSU’s 18 touchdowns in that 1935 season were passes. Floyd’s 1936 and 1937 teams went a combined 13-2-1, led by budding back Charles “Bubber” Murphy, who became MTSU’s all-time winningest coach decades later. \nEven by the standards of the time, Floyd was hailed as the savior of the Blue Raiders program in Murfreesboro. In the 1935 MTSU yearbook, Floyd’s return was penned poetically, if not mythically: \n“Athletics at Teachers College lay at the bottom of the heap. The flowers had already wilted in the vase. The murky depths beckoned. What manner of man (Floyd) was this who stepped forward, picked the groveling invalid from out the debris-strewn waste, grew and perpetuated a lusty bloom and dropped an ironclad lid on the Stygian shadows below? Was this an Horatio Alger hero embodied in the flesh?” \nIt was simply Johnny “Red” Floyd — pride of MTSU football and a lost treasure of Vanderbilt. \nReach Adam Sparks at 615-259-8010 and on Twitter @AdamSparks. \nJOHNNY “RED” FLOYD TIMELINE \n1891: Born on Franklin Road outside Murfreesboro. \n1897: Mother dies of tuberculosis. \n1914 : Debuts as player on football team at State Teachers College (later Middle Tennessee State University). \nSeptember 1914: Plays for MTSU in 9-6 win over Vanderbilt “B” team.
