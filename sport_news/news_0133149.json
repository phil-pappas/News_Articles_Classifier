One of the Mets’ hottest hitters, Daniel Murphy, was at the plate. The tying runs were aboard in the eighth. It was all the Mets could have asked for after flailing away for seven innings against Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw.\nBut Murphy — who homered for the second time in the series against Kershaw in the fourth inning — flied out meekly to right field against closer Kenley Jansen with two on and two out.\nThis wasn’t the Citi Field memory the homegrown Murphy was looking for in what potentially was his final at-bat as a Met in Queens.\nIt was that kind of night — high expectations, but results that didn’t match in an agonizing 3-1 Game 4 loss Tuesday night that forced a fifth and final Game 5 Thursday in Los Angeles.\nIt was the Mets’ best chance to pull even after the Dodgers put up three runs in the third against rookie Steven Matz. After falling behind Jansen 1-2, the free agent-to-be Murphy worked the count full, but couldn’t do much with the payoff pitch.\n“It was a cutter out over the plate,” Murphy said in the quiet clubhouse afterward. “I just missed it. Wished I wouldn’t have.”\nMurphy represented the only run the Mets pushed across with his fourth-inning solo blast, the only Met to get as far as third base. His teammates mustered just two other hits off Kershaw.\n“He didn’t make a lot of mistakes,” Murphy said. “Unfortunately, we didn’t have a lot of traffic out there on him. He threw the ball well tonight, there’s no doubt about that.\n“We didn’t give ourselves a lot of chances. The biggest chance I got against Kenley, and unfortunately I couldn’t finish the at-bat off [right].”\nMurphy’s homer to right field in the fourth inning woke up the comatose crowd for a moment as he turned around an 0-1, 93 mph fastball that got too much of the plate.\nMurphy’s success against the three-time Cy Young award winner was surprising, considering he hit .254 against southpaws in 126 at-bats during the season, and went deep only once.\nBut the playoffs have been another story. Not only has Murphy homered twice against Kershaw — he entered the series a career .300 hitter in 10 at-bats against the lefty, but without an extra-base hit — but he also had a run-scoring single against Dodgers left-hander Alex Wood in the Mets’ 13-7 victory in Game 3.\nOne of the longest-tenured Mets, drafted the last time they made the playoffs in 2006, Murphy is making the most of his playoff debut, and possibly his swan song in Queens. He will be a free agent, and the Mets have less expensive options at the position, such as Dilson Herrera, a young and talented second baseman waiting in the wings.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under daniel murphy ,  los angeles dodgers ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:21:16.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
