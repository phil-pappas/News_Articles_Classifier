The Saints took only six shots on goal, but three of them went in, and that 50-percent ratio was more than they needed in a 3-0 win over Tourtellotte. The win kept St. Bernard (5-3-1, 5-0-1) alone atop the Eastern Connecticut Conference Small Division standings. “We’re not beating East Lyme (in the ECC tournament), that’s not going to happen, so there’s really not much point in us worrying about that,” said St. Bernard coach Shane Clarke. “The Small is always our first priority, that’s what we talk about the first day of practice every year and that’s what we build to. This was a really big step toward that for us. It puts us in prime position. We would have to screw it up pretty good at this stage.” The Tigers (6-3-1, 3-2-1 ECC Small) were the Saints’ nearest competitors for that title and looked like they were going to put a crimp in their plans in the first half. St. Bernard mustered all of one shot in the first half while Tourtellotte had nine. That included a shot that just missed a wide open corner of the net, another that hit the post and one that clanged off the crossbar. “We’ve told them all week that you cannot have missed opportunities with this kind of team,” Spinelli said. “It should have been 3-0 us in the first half.” The problem, according to Spinelli, is that the Tigers have never been able to put a consistent group of players together on the pitch this season because of a rash of injuries. The latest occurred on Oct. 1 when senior stopper Carrine Sosnowski went down with a badly-sprained ankle and complications from that will keep her out for the remainder of the season. In the first meeting between the teams — won by St. Bernard, 4-1, on Sept. 15 — the Tigers were missing four starters, all lost in their season-opening match versus Plainfield. “It wasn’t the best performance in the first half from us,” Clarke said. “We’re St. Bernard. We always pray beforehand and, luckily, it worked this time. Somehow, nothing went in for them in the first half.” On the other hand, just about everything went in for the Saints in the second half. Clarke made a couple of adjustments, including bringing Kara Bassett and Emma Givens in tighter together. That created a few more passing opportunities, which the Saints used to their advantage. Page 2 of 2 - With just 17 minutes gone in the second half, Bassett worked her way through two Tourtellotte defenders and forced Tigers keeper Emily Vincent to commit while Givens was coming on from the right side. Bassett hit her junior classmate with a cross just in front of the net. “I was just lucky to be there to tap it in,” Givens said. Givens repaid the favor 11 minutes later when she found Bassett open in the middle and her teammate blasted a shot home from 20 yards out. “We’re close friends on and off the field, so it’s like we’re working for each other to win it for our team (more) than individually,” Givens said. Mia Londregan made the sacrifice on the third goal as the sophomore worked her way through the Tourtellotte defense and forced Vincent to come out. The keeper tried to get the ball off the foot of Londregan and the resulting collision saw the ball pop free. Bassett sent the ball toward the net and Givens just gave it a little helping nudge for her second goal of the contest. “It’s awesome,” Givens said. “We really needed this win to keep us up top (of the ECC Small).” By Marc Allard The Bulletin The Bulletin By Marc Allard The Bulletin Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 9:08 PM Updated at 10:40 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:57:34.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
