For now, Worsham holds the upper gear.\nWorsham, the current points leader, held on to the No. 1 qualifying position Saturday at the 30th annual AAA Texas NHRA Fall Nationals at Texas Motorplex.\nThe Fall Nationals is the 22nd of 24 events in the circuit's Mello Yello Drag Racing series and the fourth of six races in the Countdown to the Championship playoffs.\nWorsham, a Villa Park, Calif., resident who lives less than 22 miles from Beckman, had a track-record, 3.917-second pass at 323.58 mph on the 1,000-foot run Friday. Beckman is No. 2 at 3.919 and 323.97.\nWorsham heads into Sunday's eliminations at No. 1 in his Toyota Camry. He'll be paired against No. 16 John Hale (4.140 and 304.53) of Addison in the opening round.\nWorsham, 45, joked that the rivalry with Beckman, 49, might be to the point where he'd cut his tires, but \"I'd probably get disqualified.\"\nPRO STOCK: Drew Skillman was the top qualifier in Pro Stock. Skillman's 6.471-second pass in the third session was equal to Jason Line. In a ruling that caused officials to break out the NHRA rule book, Skillman was deemed the record-holder because of his faster overall speed (213.47 compared to Line's 213.40).\n. @drew_skillman talks about his rookie year & running on the same team w/Erica who's fighting for a championship. pic.twitter.com/IdfEOHrKJa\n— #NHRA (@NHRA) October 17, 2015 TOP FUEL: Dave Connolly finished his top run in 3.744 seconds and 329.18 mph, both track records, to start as a No. 1 seed for the first time. Connolly, who won this race last year in Pro Stock, will face Jenna Haddock of Temple to open Sunday's eliminations.\nPRO MOTORCYCLE: Jerry Savoie clocked a track-record 6.765-second pass at 197.79 mph to claim the No. 1 spot after the fourth round of qualifying Saturday afternoon at the AAA Texas NHRA Fall Nationals in Ennis. Both are track records. It was his third career record and his career-best time.\n\"To go .76 is really, really strong,\" said Savoie, 56, of Cut Off, La.\nSpeaking of California rivalries: The Funny Car 16-team field also pits John Force, 66, of Yorba Linda against his 27-year-old daughter, Courtney. In the rivalry, dad and daughter are tied 7-7. John Force won the only pairing this season at Atlanta (Ga.) Dragway.\nCourtney Force on racing her father John Force\n\"We're going to have an exciting race tomorrow morning here at the Texas Motorplex. We're going to have two Traxxas cars up against eachother in the first round and I'll have to race my dad. It's never fun racing a teammate, but on the plus side, it will definitely make it exciting for fans since we have this special Traxxas promotion going on this weekend. We're going to be fighting really hard to get one of the Traxxas cars into the final round so the fans can take full advantage of this promotion and get the discounts offered up this weekend. I'm definitely hoping our Traxxas team can do it. Dad's running pretty solid this weekend, but I think we have a pretty good race car as well.\nWe made two really great passes; one in the right lane and one in the left in the heat of the day. I think that along with our win here last year gives us confidence going into tomorrow. We're going to probably have to push the car a little bit harder to outrun him, but we're up for the challenge and excited to face my dad in round one.\"\nJohn Force on racing his daughter Courtney Force\n\"All our Chevy hot rods are running quick. It is tough I am going to have to race Courtney but we'll have two Traxxas Chevys going at it. The good news is one of these Camaros will go to the second round and we want to get a win so the fans can get that Traxxas Double Up promotion. Texas has been good to me and then I had my crash in 2007. I have said I am not going to quite racing until I win again at the Texas Motorplex. I'll have to beat my daughter in the first round if I want to get that win here but I know it will be a tough race.\"\nCeleb sightings\nJesse James, the former reality star and Sandra Bullock exe, came up from Austin to watch his wife Alexis DeJoria run in Funny Car. Also sighted was IndyCar Series driver Graham Rahal, who was on hand to see his fiance, Courtney Force compete in her Funny Car.\nA blur of pink\nAlexis DeJoria raced her pink PatrÃ³n XO Cafe Incendio Toyota Camry in Funny Car.\nHer car and its chutes are pink to bring attention to Breast Cancer Awareness month. The billionaire heiress was No. 8 in the ladder, three head of pal Courtney Force, who also has a pink Camaro.\nDeJoria's team debuted her pink car in Redding, Pa., earlier this month. It's by now means a Barbie car.\n\"It looks like a florescent pink Highlighter,\" she said. \"The guys on the team are a little wishy-washy about it. They say 'Oh, god, it's blinding.' I think it's cool. Something different out there.\"\nAnd it's for a good cause.\nDeJoria has partnered with Baylor Health Care Systems for a similar program at Ennis. Baylor officials will be at Texas Motorplex on Saturday and Sunday to ticketholders over the age of 40.\nJohn Hale is \"One Bad Texan\", sporting a classic style paint job for the #AAAFallNats . @JohnHaleRacing pic.twitter.com/F6fVnLkaDI\n— #NHRA (@NHRA) October 17, 2015 John Hale's car under wraps\nFunny Car driver John Hale of Addison will be doing double-driving duty at Fall Nationals. On top of his driving duties for Jim Dunn Racing, he will be behind the wheel of his Nostalgia Funny Car in an exhibition race against the Blue Max.\nTo commemorate, the Jim Dunn Racing Funny Car was wrapped to look like Hale's Nostalgia Funny Car - One Bad Texan.\n\"We wanted to celebrate racing with two special-edition cars: one in NHRA competition and one in Nostalgia where John Hale got his start,\" Jon Dunn, Jim Dunn Racing manager, said in a release.\nFunny Car driver crashes, walks away\nBryan Brown of Gainsville was examined and released Friday night after being involved in a crash of his Top Alcohol Funny Car during a qualifying session.\nBrown's 2009 Monte Carlo went out of control and ran into the right-side guard wall near the finish line.
