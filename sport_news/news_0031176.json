The Royals had a thrilling comeback victory on Friday only to face pitching ace Dallas Keuchel in Houston on Sunday as he threw 122 pitches to beat them 4-2. Before that game started, the Kansas City Chiefs broke the hearts of its fans with a very costly 18-17 loss to a poor Chicago Bears team. The loss of Jamaal Charles in the third quarter when the team was driving, deflated the entire team. The team tanked as soon as Charles left the field. It was particularly frustrating to walk out of Arrowhead Stadium and listen to all the Bears fans who dominated the stadium. Since the Royals had a 3 p.m. start time, the Chiefs faithful hit the road early and it felt like we were playing in Chicago instead of Kansas City. On Friday night the high school football playoff picture began to take shape. Rockhurst and Blue Springs are finally beginning to ratchet up their level of play. There is parity throughout all levels of high school football in the Kansas City area. The Fort Osage loss to Liberty North was a surprise to everyone, but the Class 5 state playoffs should be a real horse race with Fort Osage, Staley, Park Hill and Liberty North. Blue Springs South is not in the Kansas City district, which means it will be up against teams from the middle of the state and even the western suburbs of St. Louis. In all sports, whether it is football, baseball, basketball or soccer, you can never really predict an outcome. Sports helps all of us take a break from the worries of daily life and settle in to enjoy the artificial world of sports. Friday night I also saw a much improved Blue Springs team overwhelm a very good Lee’s Summit West team that was definitely favored going into the game. The area scores were indicative of teams who have improved and will begin to become playoff ready in the next couple of weeks. On Sunday, the Chiefs were highly favored but the atmosphere at Arrowhead seemed negative from the start. Many of the Fox Sports personnel were confused by the number of empty seats. They too noticed that the number of Bears fans seemed to outnumber the Chiefs fans. The negative tension in the parking lot after the game created some close calls with altercations, which is way out of line. The Royals’ game Sunday was the another wet blanket as they went down against the Astros in Game 3 of the ALDS before rallying Tuesday and Wednesday to advance to the ALCS against Toronto. Kansas City has a rich history of possessing some of the very best sports fans in America. A favorite phrase of mine has always been, “How do you feel when you lose and how do you feel when you win and how do you want to feel?” It has motivated me throughout my life. Sports will always have its ups and downs. Like everything else in life, it is one step at a time. Page 2 of 2 - Injuries, bad luck and poor choices affect every team in every sport. Fans need to savor the victories but show a little class with the losses. Former Notre Dame Hall of Fame football coach Ara Parseghian said it best: “Class is a quality that others admire because its behavior can be counted on as natural, simplistic, consistent, humane, and of the highest standard in all human relationships; it stands the test of time.” • I am wondering if the big money guys at the University of Texas will allow Texas head coach Charlie Strong to actually coach this week following a huge upset over Oklahoma. Perhaps they should stick with counting their money and allow the guy to build the program up to their expectations over the next few years. • Enjoy all the great sporting events ahead of you the rest of the year.
