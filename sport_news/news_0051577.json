Courts have ruled federal law doesn't allow providers to be excluded from Medicaid because they perform abortions.\nRepublicans in Congress are trying to change that.\nAlthough lawmakers have targeted the group before, they're particularly fired up this year by undercover videos taken by anti-abortion activists of Planned Parenthood officials discussing the distribution of fetal tissues.\nAll of Indiana's eight GOP lawmakers in Congress, as well as Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly , have voted to defund Planned Parenthood.\nThe language is expected to be part of a procedural tool called budget reconciliation that is protected from a filibuster in the Senate, but that President Barack Obama would veto.\nIf the procedural move fails, Republicans may try to insist the defunding measure be included in the budget agreement that will be needed to keep the federal government funded past Dec. 11.\nINDIANAPOLIS STAR\nRenewed fight expected over Indiana abortion clinic rules\nPlanned Parenthood is already barred from using taxpayer money to pay for abortion, except in cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life is in danger.\nNearly 90 percent of the $450 million in annual federal funds the organization receives nationally comes from treating Medicaid patients. Most of the rest comes from the Title X program for family planning services.\nGOP lawmakers, including Rep. Todd Young of Bloomington, have said there are plenty of other health-care providers that could pick up Planned Parenthood's patients.\n\"If the best argument on the other side is that eliminating taxpayer subsidies for Planned Parenthood would create access problems, that is just not the case,\" Young argued on the House floor last month.\nBut Indiana associations representing clinics that serve low-income Hoosiers aren't as confident.\nKristin Adams, president and CEO of the Indiana Family Health Council, which distributes the federal Title X funding in Indiana, said she doesn't know if the funding could be shifted from Planned Parenthood clinics quickly enough to avoid gaps in services. Planned Parenthood got 17 percent of the $5.65 million Indiana received last year in Title X grants.\n\"We would have to do the research and get clinics started up very quickly,\" she said. \"We will make the adjustments as we need to. But it is not going to be an overnight transition.\"\nWhile the defunding measure would increase federal funding for community health centers, Indiana has ranked at the bottom in per capita funding for Federally Qualified Health Centers, so capacity is smaller in Indiana, according to Phil Morphew, CEO of the Indiana Primary Health Care Association.\nMorphew said the short answer to whether community health centers could replace Planned Parenthood is, \"I don't know.\"\n\"That implies that Federally Qualified Health Centers are an alternative for all Planned Parenthood patients, and I don't know the answer to that,\" he said.\nA 2013 study by The George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services found that while most community health centers provide family planning services, the scope of care varied widely. For example, some of the most common types of birth control were not available at the centers, and they have trouble attracting and retaining specialized staff.\nMorphew said there are many reasons why someone might prefer going to a Planned Parenthood clinic, instead of a community health center, including location and an established relationship with a health-care provider.\n\"I would think patient choice should enter into this,\" he said.\nLyndsey Schmid, a 33-year-old child support caseworker in Bloomington, has used Planned Parenthood as her primary care provider for almost two decades.\nAfter first going there as a high school student, Schmid particularly appreciated the fact that, in college, she could pay for birth control on a sliding scale based on her income. But even when cost was no longer an issue, Schmid stayed with Planned Parenthood for the quality of care. The clinic was where she turned to confirm that she was pregnant with her son.\n\"The staff and I were literally hugging. They were so excited,\" she said. \"They truly have an interest in you and your well-being. And that's why I've stuck with them this whole time and have no interest in getting care anywhere else.\"\nPlanned Parenthood, which has operated in Indiana since 1932, has closed clinics in Indiana in recent years. While it had about 40 centers 15 years ago, now there are 23.\nBetty Cockrum, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, said Planned Parenthood has faced the same economic challenges faced by other health-care providers in recent years.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nHundreds protest against Planned Parenthood\nIn addition, the amount of federal and state funding has declined from representing about 80 percent of Planned Parenthood's income to about 22 percent.\n\"When there's this suggestion that other providers will step up tomorrow if we're not there, I dare say I couldn't name another health-care provider who does raise private funding in order to subsidize health care to their patients,\" she said.\nTwo years after Planned Parenthood closed its clinic in Scott County, the community is still trying to get a clinic in the area, which is the center of an unprecedented HIV epidemic linked to opioid addiction.\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has told lawmakers it's \"highly uncertain\" whether Planned Parenthood could replace federal Medicaid and Title X dollars during the one-year ban included in the budget instructions the Senate is expected to vote on soon. As few as 5 percent, or as many as 25 percent, of patients nationally could face reduced access to care.\nPermanently defunding Planned Parenthood would cost the federal government about $130 million over 10 years in increased Medicaid costs because of the thousands of unplanned births that would result, the CBO estimates.\nIndiana could be affected more than most states, according to data provided to the CBO by the Guttmacher Institute, which researches reproductive health and also advocates for reproductive rights.\nIn 2010, Planned Parenthood served 67 percent of Indiana women getting contraceptive service from a publicly funded center, compared with 36 percent nationally. Only Vermont and Utah had higher rates.\nThe institute's figures also show public expenditures on family planning services in Indiana were $53 for every Hoosier woman in need, compared with $124 nationally.\nAnd state-only sources of funding made up 4 percent of public expenditures in Indiana compared with a national average of 12 percent.\nThat's left a gap being filled in large part by Planned Parenthood, said Kinsey Hasstedt, a public policy associate at the Guttmacher Institute.\n\"There are some areas of the country, like you're seeing in Indiana, where Planned Parenthood is often the only game in town,\" Hasstedt said. \"So if Planned Parenthood were to lose its funding, and health centers were forced to close, then these women would be without their chosen provider.\"\nContact Maureen Groppe at mgroppe@gannett.com or @mgroppe on Twitter.\nThe anti-abortion Center for Medical Progress alleges that their undercover video proves that Planned Parenthood makes money off of parts from aborted fetuses.\nPlanned Parenthood's impact on low-income women in Indiana\nLow-income women in Indiana rely on Planned Parenthood for contraceptive services more than in most states, according to 2010 statistics from the Guttmacher Institute.\nPercentage of publicly supported safety-net family planning centers that are Planned Parenthood centers nationally: 10 percent.\nPercentage of publicly supported safety-net family planning centers that are Planned Parenthood centers in Indiana: 30 percent.\nPercentage of women who get contraceptive services from a safety-net family planning center that use Planned Parenthood nationally: 36 percent.\nPercentage of women who get contraceptive services from a safety-net family planning center that use Planned Parenthood in Indiana: 67 percent.\nSources of public funding for family planning services in Indiana versus national average, 2010:\nMedicaid: 65% (U.S.: 75%)\nTitle X: 20% (U.S.: 10%)\nOther federal sources: 11% (U.S.: 3%)\nState-only sources: 4% (U.S.: 12%)\nStates with the lowest public expenditures for family planning services per woman in need, 2010:\nUtah: $31\nNevada: $41\nNorth Dakota: $50\nIndiana: $53\nRhode Island: $57\nU.S. average: $124\nSource: Guttmacher Institute", "external_links": ["http://indy.st/1J2HSNH", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b8dcd8056598948e655c8d202759877cedf54aa7/c=0-130-2996-1823&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/08/22/Louisville/Louisville/635758485008642257-5DS-9864.jpg", "http://bc_gvpc.edgesuite.net/img/963482463001/201507/3917/963482463001_4356533081001_4356380361001-th.jpg?pubId=963482463001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cbf5809c44e56d331cf9d490beea27ad0f3b3e30/c=352-0-1649-1297/local/-/media/2015/06/10/Indianapolis/B9317685784Z.1_20150610192922_000_G6QB1U9AM.1-0.jpg", "http://bc_gvpc.edgesuite.net/img/963482463001/201507/3917/963482463001_4356533080001_4356380361001-vs.jpg?pubId=963482463001", "http://www.indystar.com/videos/news/2015/07/16/30242737/", "http://bc_gvpc.edgesuite.net/img/963482463001/201507/3917/963482463001_4356533080001_4356380361001-vs.jpg", "http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2015/06/10/renewed-fight-expected-indiana-abortion-clinic-rules/71037528/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f35c8c95db56611d590aaf71655e066dfd6fcaad/r=540&c=540x304/http/bc_gvpc.edgesuite.net/img/963482463001/201507/3917/963482463001_4356533080001_4356380361001-vs.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T18:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:04:09.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
