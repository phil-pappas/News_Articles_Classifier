Oh, did that cause some damage? Well, it also saved the Los Angeles Dodgers’ season and left the New York Mets without their starting shortstop for whatever remains of their postseason run. “I think that’s winning baseball,” Utley said.\nMore on MLB\nMets Irate After Takeout Slide Breaks Tejada’s Leg Zack Greinke: Baseball’s Most Obsessively Prepared Pitcher Why Comedians Love the Mets Remember ‘Sad Mets Fan’? That’s an indictment of the culture of a sport in which celebrating with too much outward emotion is a punishable sin while deliberately taking out an opponent’s legs is considered admirable by some. But more than anything, what transpired at Dodger Stadium exposed Major League Baseball’s failure to adequately protect infielders from unnecessary injury.\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates lost one of their best players, third baseman Jung Ho Kang, to a broken leg on a similar play last month. And now the Mets will return to Citi Field for Game 3 on Monday without Tejada, who had to be carted off the field.\nIn any sport, there are injuries that simply can’t be prevented. And even in baseball, which is less about physicality than football or basketball, some collisions are unavoidable. But it is not in MLB’s business interests to needlessly lose talent to injuries. And in that regard, Utley’s slide revealed a failure on two levels.\nThe first was umpires’ inability to enforce a rule that already exists. MLB Rule 6.01 states that if a runner “willfully and deliberately interferes with a batted ball or a fielder in the act of fielding a batted ball with the obvious intent to break up a double play, the ball is dead. The umpire shall call the runner out for interference and also call out the batter-runner because of the action of his teammate.”\nWatch: Chase Utley’s Slide That Broke Ruben Tejada’s Leg It is difficult to watch replays of Utley plowing into Tejada and not conclude that it constituted interference. People will call it a takeout slide, but Utley wasn’t sliding into second base. He wasn’t sliding at all, actually. He ran wide of second base by at least a foot, without so much as reaching to touch it. Then, with Tejada’s back turned to him as he spun to throw to first, Utley lowered himself just enough to undercut Tejada. “That’s not a slide,” Mets outfielder Michael Cuddyer said. “That’s a tackle.”\nMLB chief baseball officer Joe Torre didn’t say how the play was legal beyond deeming it “a judgment play.” But it wasn’t just a failure of judgment by umpires.\nThe play was also an indictment of the current rules, which don’t go far enough to prevent things like this from happening. Players should be allowed to slide into second base as hard as they want without regard for the fielder, and if that makes it harder for the fielder to turn a double play, mission accomplished. But the current interpretation of the rule allows runners to take out fielders as long as they’re in the vicinity of the base. In theory, the runner could be reaching to tag the base with one hand. But in practice, it enables runners to use their bodies as weapons while barely feigning intent to reach base.\nWhat MLB needs is a rule to protect infielders like one of the rules it adopted last year to better protect catchers from collisions at home plate: “A runner attempting to score may not deviate from his direct pathway to the plate in order to initiate contact with the catcher (or other player covering home plate), or otherwise initiate an avoidable collision.”\nTorre said MLB had already planned to test such a rule in its fall instructional league for prospects. The league served as a sort of laboratory as MLB experimented with pace of play rules last year. This year, runners there will be required to slide directly into the base. “We’re always looking to protect players,” Torre said. But if there were any doubt about the need for that rule at the major-league level, it was erased Saturday night.\nFour years ago, San Francisco Giants catcher Buster Posey suffered a severe leg injury on a collision at home plate, and MLB responded by enacting new rules to protect catchers.\nTejada’s injury was the equivalent for infielders: a loss so avoidable as to make change seem not only necessary but inevitable.\nWrite to Brian Costa at brian.costa@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T16:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:38:19.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
