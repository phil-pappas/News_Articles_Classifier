The players are stationed in the city ahead of the third one-day international between the hosts and South Africa. \nA photo posted by BCCI's official Twitter handle shows Pujara posing with the ODI team members. Indian skipper MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli are seen standing next to Pujara. Suresh Raina, Ajinkya Rahane, Umesh Yadav, Amit Mishra and Rohit Sharma were also part of the dinner team. Injured offspinner Ravichandran Ashwin, who is touring with the team, was also among the guests. \nPujara, who is not part of the ODI squad, is a key member of the Test squad. Pujara marked his return to Test cricket with a series-winning century against Sri Lanka in the third and final Test of the tour. India, under skipper Kohli, went on to create history by winning a series on the Lankan soil after 22 years. \nThe ongoing five-match ODI series against South Africa is leveled at 1-1, after Dhoni led India to a 22-run victory in the second ODI in Indore on Monday. Team India had a lovely dinner last evening at the Pujara residence in Rajkot. pic.twitter.com/LHV64sk41c >\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T09:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:04:39.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
