Linderman ready for bout in Oroville Comment By Daily News Sports Editor Bill Choy@SDNBillChoy   By Daily News Sports Editor Bill Choy@SDNBillChoy Posted Oct. 2, 2015 at 7:34 PM By Daily News Sports Editor Bill Choy@SDNBillChoy Posted Oct. 2, 2015 at 7:34 PM YREKA Local professional MMA fighter D.J. “Da Protege” Linderman is set to get back in the cage for a bout a little more than three hours away from Yreka onSaturday. Linderman will face Carl Seumanutafa in a heavyweight battle at the main event at the King of the Cage Total Elimination fights. The event will be held at Gold Country Casino & Hotel in Oroville,Calif. Doors open at 6 p.m., with the fights starting at 7 p.m. “I’m very excited,” Linderman said. “I’m ready to get back fighting again.” Linderman last fought in a MMA bout in April in Fort Lauderdale,Fla. D.J. won the Howard Davis JR’S Fight Time Promotions heavyweight title against former UFC fighter Jeff Monson by TKO in the fifth round. This past summer, Linderman earned an invitation at the last minute to take part in a professional heavyweight boxing bout in Central Point, Ore., in July. Linderman had not fought a pro boxing match in five years, but came out strong to earn a sixth round knockout over Javier Torres. Linderman, who comes into the Saturday fight at 19-9 as a pro, hopes if he can improve on his two bout MMA win streak, he can earn a potential UFC fight if he can win his next two matches. “I know that to get a shot I have to keep that winning streak going,” he said. Currently,D.J. has a match on Nov. 6 in Colorado and another bout the end of November inSweden. His opponent onSaturday, Seumanutafa, is 10-5 as an MMA pro. Linderman said that his opponent is an aggressive standup fighter that is always looking for the TKO.He added that Seumanutafa has earned a TKO in nine out of his 10 wins. D.J. said he needs to be aggressive and tough in the stand up game and try to get him to the ground and be efficient with his kicks and punches to take his opponent down. D.J said he expects a number of friends, family and co-workers to watch the bout. “It will be nice to have people there rooting me on,” he said. Training has gone well, Linderman said. He added that he is grateful to all those who have helped him get ready for his fight, This includes assistance from good friend and fellow local pro MMA fighter Beau Hamilton, who is also getting ready for an upcoming pro MMA bout, which will take place inRedding on Oct. 17. Linderman, who works at Fruit Growers Supply Company, recently met Austin Brown, who was working for another company assisting on a project at his work place for four months. Brown, an MMA enthusiast fromIdaho with knowledge in wrestling and Jiu jitsu, heard about Linderman around three months into his time inYreka, and struck up a friendship with him. He helped spar and train with D.J. for around a month before he had to return home last week. D.J. said that sparing with Brown proved valuable, and said it has helped him a lot to get ready for his bout.
