Due to the close proximity of fixtures Sundaram Ravi, a member of the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires, had previously been selected for the Pakistan versus England series, but will now stand in the fourth ODI between India and South Africa in Chennai on Thursday. Because of exceptional circumstances, both the BCCI and CSA have agreed that two Indian umpires will stand in this game. As a result, there are changes to the Pakistan-England series. Bruce Oxenford and Paul Reiffel will be on the on-field umpires for the second Test which starts in Dubai on Thursday, while Chris Gaffaney has been named as the TV umpire. Oxenford and Gaffaney will stand in the third Test in Sharjah, with Reiffel named as TV umpire. The ICC appreciates the cooperation of all four Boards in facilitating the changes; the BCCI, CSA, PCB and ECB. —- ICC \nRelated posts:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:39:13.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
