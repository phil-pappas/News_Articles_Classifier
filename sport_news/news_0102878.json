(Brian Cassella / Chicago Tribune) Chris Hine Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune How have Blackhawks won two games without Duncan Keith? \nThe Blackhawks have survived two games without defenseman Duncan Keith and despite some forecasts, the product on the ice has not been a disaster. \nThe Hawks have picked up four points in two games with the struggling Ducks coming to town Monday night. \nYoung defenders like Viktor Svedberg and Trevor van Riemsdyk have assumed more ice time and more responsibility without skipping a beat through two games. \nBut if there is an insight into how the Hawks may survive without Keith it became clear in the last two games. The Hawks are going to try to hang onto the puck as long as possible and keep the puck in their opponent's zone. \nIt sounds like a brainless move, and it's something they would do without Keith, but with Keith out, hanging onto the puck takes on added importance. They don't have to play defense if they are always on offense. \nIn their two games against the Panthers and Lightning, the Hawks led in shots on goal 59-39. \nThe Panthers committing eight penalties on Thursday might have had something to do with the Hawks' favorable possession numbers, but Saturday's performance against the Lightning, one of the top scoring teams in the league, was not a fluke. \nAll the action from the United Center. \n\"That's how we play, whether (Keith's) in or out of our lineup,\" coach Joel Quenneville said. \"We said we didn't want to change how we play and that creates (the opponent) defending, sustains the momentum of the game. They're vulnerable to penalties.\" \nThe Hawks could not light the lamp often against the Lightning on Saturday, only winning 1-0 when Jonathan Toews scored a goal 17 seconds into 3-on-3 overtime, but the Hawks had possession of the puck most of the night and limited the Lightning's ability to mount momentum and significant scoring chances. It was the same formula the Hawks used to down the Lightning in the Stanley Cup Final. \n\"That’s the best way to play defense, if you can manage the puck well and have it,\" Toews said. \"As we’ve been saying over the last couple games 'Duncs' has been out, the focus is trying to make up for that void that he leaves when he's not around. It doesn't just land on our defensemen who are assuming a little more responsibility. It's our forwards, too.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T21:23:56.650+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
