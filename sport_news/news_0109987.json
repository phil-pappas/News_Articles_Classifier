Posted: Friday, October 9, 2015 6:00 am No. 4 SU field hockey has overtime setback against No. 1 Millersville Courtesy of SU Sports Information ShipNC.com | 0 comments \nThe No. 4 Shippensburg University field hockey team battle No. 1 Millersville in a competitive Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference (PSAC) contest Wednesday, but the visiting Marauders scored on a penalty corner in overtime to notch a 1-0 victory over the Raiders at Robb Sports Complex. \nShippensburg (8-3, 3-2 PSAC) and Millersville (12-0, 5-0) combined for just eight shots on goal in a contest that was marred with whistles and never quite established a steady flow. The Marauders managed 10 corners to SU’s five, but the majority of the contest was played in the middle of the field – maximizing the importance of each team’s passing. kAm%96 >@DE ?@E23=6 D4@C:?8 492?46 @7 E96 7:CDE 92=7 H2D DEJ>:65 3J D@A9@>@C6 #2;496= |@@C6[ H9@ >256 2 CF??:?8 DE@A @?
