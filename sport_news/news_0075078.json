Maggie Beck / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. When her grandchildren came to live with her more than a year ago, Karen Van Eaton felt like she was starting all over. But she also felt it was in the best interest of the children, both elementary school age, to live with her and her husband in Arnold. Now it feels like the most traditional of families. The Van Eatons are among almost 3 million grandparents in the United States and nearly 300,000 in California who are raising their grandchildren, according to 2012 Census data. Often, the grandparents seek permanent custody. In Calaveras County, the Grandparent Project helps grandparents through the legal and emotional changes that come with the unexpected. Therese May, a facilitator with the Grandparent Project, said 70 people are registered with the project, now in its ninth year. May said many more may be out there. “There are grandparents or caregivers that we don’t know about because some of this is about fear and about pride,” May said. “Some people do not want people in the community or schools to know that things are not going great in their family.” The Grandparent Project began nearly 10 years ago when Bonnie Danielson recognized that a significant number of grandparent and relative caregivers were raising children in Calaveras County. “She is a family therapist and has always worked within the Calaveras County schools with both of those areas of work,” May said. “She stumbled on the fact that there were a lot of grandparents and relatives providing care for children.” The Grandparent Project is unique. It’s not a support group only. The program tailors topics at each meeting based on pressing need. “What I do in the beginning of every year with the two groups that I lead is, I send them a questionnaire at the beginning of the year and ask them to let me know ‘what do you want to know about,’” May said. “Each of the leaders of the group tries to tailor the services that the grandparents or the relative caregivers need.” May, one of three facilitators with the program that meets four times a month in locations throughout Calaveras County, said she brings in an expert to speak every other month. Throughout the years, May has brought in experts from numerous fields, ranging from law and custody to financial advising to mental health and positive role model mentorship. “My perspective is that it’s good for the group to hear from somebody besides me or the other facilitators,” May said. “I could speak on all of those things, but I personally think it’s just good for them to hear from another perspective from another professional.” Though those within the Grandparent Program are not new to raising children, most face a new set of problems unique to those they encountered the first time around. Health concerns, the loss of the golden years and financial issues are all factors that grandparents or other relative caregivers face, but May said they do not complain about the inherited burdens. “They’re an amazingly strong population. I think that it’s currently due to the fact that we just love our grandchildren so much that even if we are 70, and I have two that are 80, we’re not going to give up on those grandkids” May said. “They’re going to be with them as long as they physically and mentally can.” Funding for the program comes from the Calaveras County Health and Human Services Agency through the Mental Health Services Act and is administered by the Calaveras County Office of Education. Funding for the Grandparent Project will continue in 2016, however May said it is unknown at this time what the plan will be for next year. “What we’re going to try and do this year is create some measurable outcomes,” May said. “The question would be, for the grandparents, how has this program helped you? How are we doing as facilitators? We want to be able to get their anecdotal responses to that, and that would drive what changes would happen for next year.” Van Eaton, who is a member of the Grandparent Project, said she and her husband gained custody of the children in December 2014. “My fear was one of the parents changing their mind and coming and knocking on my door and saying ‘I want my kids back now,’” she said. She learned the process of obtaining guardianship through the project. And, she said, they have benefited from the support and experiences of others in the same situation. “The reason for doing that is, and this was told to me from another grandparent, she said, ‘don’t worry about what you’re doing. With doing this, you’re protecting the children.’ I did this with all interest in protecting them and making sure that they’re safe and secure,” Van Eaton said. “It created a lot of stability in our house, and that’s what they needed.” Birth parents can go to court to regain custody but have to prove they can provide a suitable environment. May said it is a difficult process. “If the parents want to get them back after the court has given another relative guardianship, the parents have to prove that ‘I am in a better place, I can take care of my own kids.’ In the nine years that I have been working for the project, it has never happened.” Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:04:12.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
