North Andover at Methuen and Billerica at Haverhill are also equally important and tough to draw a line on as is Cape Ann League clash Pentucket at Masconomet. \nStanding tall above these intriguing matchups, however, is Friday night’s Central Catholic at Andover clash of talented 4-1 clubs, a game which is always huge. For this game, I’m fairly confident. \nAndover is certainly capable of what would have to be an upset, if E.J. Perry gets hot throwing the ball, but the Raiders have, thus far, shown a stronger all-around team. And sophomore quarterback Bret Edwards seems to improve every week and keeps getting better at utilizing his many weapons. \nPREDICTION: Central Catholic 27, Andover 23 \nFRIDAY’S GAMES \nBillerica (5-0) at Haverhill (3-2) \nI’d love to see an upset, and some timely turnovers could make one happen, but Billerica’s running game looks too tough. \nPREDICTION: Billerica 32, Haverhill 19 \nNorth Andover (3-2) at Methuen (2-3) \nLook for some long gainers and plenty of excitement. The Rangers have some momentum, but the Knights should be able to regroup from last week’s spanking. \nPREDICTION: North Andover 26, Methuen 22 \nTimberlane (4-2) at Pinkerton (5-1) \nColleague Mike Muldoon predicted I’d do this, so let’s not disappoint him — I think Timberlane is capable and very well may prevail, but I just can’t pick against Pinkerton at home, especially coming off of a loss. \nPREDICTION: Pinkerton 24, Timberlane 17 \nMerrimack (4-2) at Salem (4-2) \nThis game scares me. Maybe my pick will fire up the Blue Devils. \nPREDICTION: Merrimack 27, Salem 21 \nLawrence (2-3) at Dracut (0-5) \nDracut’s defense is easily exploited. \nPREDICTION: Lawrence 39, Dracut 16 \nLondonderry (2-4) at Spaulding (0-6) \nSpaulding showed last week that it has potential, so the Lancers better beware. \nPREDICTION: Londonderry 31, Spaulding 27 \nWindham (5-0) at Pelham (0-5) \nPelham will battle the best it can, but the Jaguars’ reserves should see plenty of action in the second half. \nPREDICTION: Windham 41, Pelham 7 \nGr. Lawrence (4-1) at Mystic Valley (3-2) \nThis is clearly a tossup so the home team gets the edge. \nPREDICTION: Mystic Valley 24, Gr. Lawrence 22 \nPentucket (5-0) at Masconomet (1-4) \nThe Sachems have been awesome at home, but how will they do on the road? This is my upset special of the week ... and Pentucket fans can thank me any time. \nPREDICTION: Masconomet 21, Pentucket 20 \nTriton (3-2) at North Reading (4-1) \nMaybe I overrated the Hornets, but I look for them to bounce back at home. \nPREDICTION: North Reading 28, Triton 17 \nSATURDAY’S GAMES \nWhittier (2-3) at Northeast (1-4) \nAfter taking a couple of steps forward, the Wildcats may have to take a step backward. \nPREDICTION: Northeast 22, Whittier 20 \nMonadnock (4-2) at Sanborn (1-4) \nThis won’t help but the Indians are better than its record indicates. \nPREDICTION: Monadnock 30, Sanborn 20 \nBrooks (1-2) at St. Mark’s (1-2) \nLook for a big game from Methhuen’s Jalen Martinez. \nPREDICTION: Brooks 34, St. Mark’s 24 \nPhillips Academy (2-1) at Cushing (0-3) \nPhillips is one of the surprise teams of the year. \nPREDICTION: Phillips 29, Cushing 8 \nSeason record: 58-25 With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T09:51:18.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
