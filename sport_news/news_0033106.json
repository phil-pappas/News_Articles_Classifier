It was not a cheerful volume. In it Birkerts wrote of his troubles with the way that, “[t]he stable hierarchies of the printed page – one of the defining norms of that world – are being superseded by the rush of impulses through freshly minted circuits.” Reading, he argued, had already changed in the accelerated pace of modern life, and seemed to promise to change further. This was alarming to him, and he argued that people ought to resist the whole advance of computers on principle. In fact, the last words of The Gutenberg Elegies were “Refuse it.”\n“Which then got me staked out as a kind of Luddite weirdo,” Birkerts says to me ruefully. “But that book came out right at a time when it was sort of a culturally hot topic, so [it got] much more attention that it might have if it had come at another time.”\nHe may be right. In 1994, the internet was still text-based and dial-up friendly, email was just beginning to seep into daily life, and the prospect of everyone carrying around slim and elegant devices on which we’d consume books with the stroke of a finger seemed deeply unlikely. This left a lot of space for dreamers to fill with utopian visions of a degree of interconnection that would bring us all peace and prosperity.\nFor a time, Birkerts got to play the foil to this, in panels and articles, but he tired of the act. He was not really a pundit by training. In fact, he had, until The Gutenberg Elegies, spent most of his life as a book critic, one with the specifically un-showy mission of surfacing forgotten or neglected work. So he returned to his work as the editor of the small literary journal AGNI and continued to write essays, but chose topics closer to his personal experience. That was, for many years, more satisfying to him.\nYet in his new book, Changing the Subject: Art and Attention in the Internet Age , Birkerts is returning to that topic. Intriguingly, he returns to it as someone who has made certain concessions to the internet in his daily life. He has, for example, a cellphone and a (new-ish) Twitter account , which he admits he enjoys. “Here I am in my early 60s,” he says, “and I have discovered for the first time in my life the great fun of taking pictures.” And he admits that when he learned he could press a button and share that picture on his Twitter feed, he says: “Then it was all over for me.”\nOver the course of Changing the Subject, Birkerts will also tell you that he is, like the rest of us now, well-immersed in the world of internet jargon, of apps, of blogs and commentary. And this measure of experience, perhaps, explains why in many ways Changing the Subject is a far more convincing book when it starts to question the pieties of digital evangelism. The essays here collected don’t project, into the future, a worry about lapsed attention. Instead they track it as a live phenomenon – the disappearance of a kind of attention, one which Birkerts sees as integral to the process of writing – in a tone that feels more like the elegies he had promised in the title of that other, more polemical book.\nWe get to talking about essays and their relationship to attention. “I always think of the essay form as a mode of meditation in a way,” he tells me, speaking in his slowly but perfectly constructed sentences. “You go toward whatever is your chosen subject and you find a way to most interestingly and truly meditate about it.” He says he doesn’t want to be bound to the meditation metaphor, not exactly, but he’s got himself going. “You have to be able to sink into your material,” Birkerts continues, “you have to be able to take hold of it at a level which requires, and is, a kind of paying attention.”\nAnd with digital culture, he argues, “That particular quality of mind is under threat.” Then he pauses. “I don’t mean to sound ominous or dire.” And he also doesn’t mean to sound like he is judging the behaviour of others from some superior perch. “If I watch myself through the course of the day and see all the ways in which I am pulled away from that – and I don’t just mean things going on in the screen, the intensity and fragmentation of what it takes to conduct a life – an essay or anything else, any kind of attempt at expression, is a rebuttal to that.”\nHe qualifies further. “I don’t imagine we’re all going to live inside the consumption or making of art. But I think [art] is ... it’s a way of taking something back which is easily taken away from us.”\nAs he is talking I keep thinking about how, years ago, I might have disagreed with him, but now my heart is swelling with the fever of a convert. To be fair, we now live in a more hospitable cultural moment for digital pessimism. As we all try to keep up with all the tweets and the Instagrammers and the irritating arguments some people insist on having on your Facebook wall as though by friending them you have given them some kind of a certificate of entitlement to your time and attention ... Well, it’s certainly starting to be clear to everyone that they distract from longer, more contemplative projects.\nI ask Birkerts if he considers all this distraction antithetical to the novel, too. He does, he admits, but only partly, insisting, “I’m not trying to be crudely binary.” But for him the experience of the novel is the opposite of this sort of distracted, fluttering feeling of contemporary life.\nBirkerts concedes that some novelists manage to engage with digital culture: “I do think there are various people working who are, in very interesting ways, if not in terms of immediate subject matter, at least in terms of the kind of mood or atmosphere of the contemporary that they are trying to capture, is one that is very much aware of digital living. Thinking of, you know, Teju Cole , it’s there in the tone.” Birkerts also points to Mohsin Hamid , too, as someone who he feels is chronicling the mood well.\n“They are writing out of the new culture, but they are not writing directly about it,” Birkerts continued. “They’re finding ways to use language, scene and narrative means to create that particularly sort of slightly weightless sensation that we sometimes get, living as we do. So I do think it’s available as a subject matter. But in order for anyone to get at it as a subject matter, they still have to be in that other attentive and focussed place that creative things come out of.\n“I don’t know that you can write about distraction out of distraction,” he finally concludes. “I think you have to be tuned in and then you can write about it.”\nThat argument made me think of my favourite essay in Changing the Subject, where Birkerts dramatizes and then analyses a moment of insight of his own. In It Wants to Find You, he records himself scrolling carelessly through an essay about Nicholson Baker that appeared at Slate . But when his eyes fall on a sentence which connected Baker’s work to Iris Murdoch’s ideal of “loving attention,” a lot of thoughts he had been having about the moral imperative to read fall suddenly into place. “I registered the flash of implication,” he writes.\nAnd though of course it doesn’t mean he’s totally succumbed to the visions of those mid-90s utopians, it seems significant that he found the gem of insight right there, on the internet.", "external_links": ["http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2012/08/nicholson_baker_s_essay_collection_the_way_the_world_works_reviewed_.html", "http://www.bu.edu/agni/", "https://twitter.com/svenbirkerts?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor", "https://www.graywolfpress.org/books/changing-subject", "http://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/18/books/are-there-books-in-our-future.html?pagewanted=all"], "published": "2015-10-13T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T15:40:01.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
