Governor Beshear was one of about 20 people around to hear it. Thanks to Rob Haynes for filming it and sharing it with KSR. \nIt’s pretty awesome… \nI love working at the State Capitol. Thanks to the University of Kentucky Men's Choir for the concert today. -with Liles Bennett Taylor Christin Miller Julie Garland-Stevenson \nPosted by Rob Haynes on Tuesday, October 20, 2015 Article written by Drew Franklin I can recite every line from Forrest Gump, blindfolded.

I truly HATE IT when someone??? decides they want to keep the words to a beautiful song and then they TOTALLY change the music. Why not just sing the words to My Old Kentucky Home to the tune of Old McDonald Had A Farm…it would have sounded much better than what they did, which to me was very disrespectful!

That was unreal! intheshadow October 22, 2015 at 7:49 pm | Permalink \nAre you a music major at UK, paid to leave your comment? Great lyrics and a beautiful song, that was totally destroyed with some off the shelf made up tune. If you can sing, then you should be able to sing the correct melody. THAT version of My Old Kentucky Home was unrecognizable. UK school of music grad October 22, 2015 at 8:12 pm | Permalink \nIntheshadow – do you know the song? Here’s another performance by the UK Men’s Choir of the same arrangement with a little less reverb. Recognize it now? It’s a pretty basic choral arrangement up until the ending, where it gets barbershop-ish. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xhKpRPjSHAM Micah October 22, 2015 at 7:58   \nThat was awesome. I don’t know what all the complaining is about. this is simply the choral version of the song. The reverb may have been a little much but they did an awesome job! Dave Rust October 22, 2015 at 8:09   \nIncredible. Stopped me and my wife and our tracks. Couldn’t find enough Kleenex. I don’t think I’ve ever heard A better rendition. God bless our state although I have lived in Indiana for 62 years.
