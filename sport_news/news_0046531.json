It was an offer that I've been praying for,\" he said. \"I'm blessed to have it come to fruition that I was offered by them.\"\nAlthough the 6-foot-3, 231-pound junior prospect, out of East Nashville Magnet (Nashville, Tennessee), admitted he is unfamiliar with the inner workings of the Oregon program, Phillips has a personal connection that he expects to provide an insider's perspective.\n\"I don't know that much about Oregon. I know they have a nice program – just from seeing them in the top rankings and on (television) all the time,\" he said. \"I used to train with ( Ugo Amadi ), so I'll have a lot of insight on all things football and about the school. I'll see how it really is up there.\"\nPhillips expects to lean heavily on Amadi to help get him up to speed on what Oregon has to offer.\n\"I don't have a talk-everyday-type of relationship with him. We trained. We worked out when he was here,\" the linebacker said. \"He's a real good guy, and I know he wouldn't lead me wrong if I asked him questions.\"\nEven before that conversation takes place, however, Phillips has scheduled an unofficial visit to Eugene.\n\"I'm going out there for the USC game (on November 21),\" he explained.\nPhillips, who is rated the No. 8 inside linebacker in the nation by Rivals, also holds offers from Illinois, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Ole Miss, Tennessee, Vanderbilt and others, so there is already plenty of competition for the dynamic playmaker.\nStill, after flipping Amadi from LSU in the class of 2015 , Oregon has proven it can snag talent out of Tennessee.\nCan the Ducks do it again in 2017?\n\"Moving doesn't bother me at all. I don't think it will bother my family that much either. They want what's best for me, and whatever program fits me the best,\" Phillips said. \"I have no problem going to Japan if thats' it.\"\n-- Andrew Nemec\nanemec@oregonian.com\n@ AndrewNemec", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jacobphillips_1/status/652121761761374208", "http://www.goducks.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=210124059", "http://t.co/lptIgd4oY2", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ducks?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/AndrewNemec", "http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/player-Jacob-Phillips-165268"], "published": "2015-10-09T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:24:01.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
