A sold-out crowd of 7,026 people had been divided pretty clearly inside of Dahlberg Arena. The left half of the arena was mostly maroon, the right side mostly red. The University of Montana men’s basketball team was about to drop a tough one to EWU, a really tough one. The 2014-2015 title game ended that evening 69-65, advantage Eastern. \nThat night will be a tough one to live down for the Montana basketball community. Coming so close then having to completely reset and focus on a new year will be tough for head coach Travis DeCuire and the Griz, but it’s a challenge they are ready to embrace. \nThis time last year, Montana had just been picked to finish fifth in the preseason media poll and a lowly eighth place by the coaches. They had just lost one of the best players in program history, Kareem Jamar, so the picks weren’t ultra-outlandish, but they still seemed a bit low considering the team still boasted Jordan Gregory, Mario Dunn and Martin Breunig. So it had to have been quite a surprise to the Big Sky Conference then, when the Grizzlies stormed their way to the best regular season conference record, and stopped just four points short of a championship. \nWell, another year, another preseason poll, and this time folks have seemingly made way for Montana. \nLast week, the Grizzlies were picked to win the conference by the media in the poll, and came up just short in the coaches’ poll, picked to finish second just behind Weber State. \nAfter losing Jordan Gregory, one of their most talented and popular players to graduation, it is a bit surprising to see people change their tune so quickly, but I guess that’s what a run like last year’s will do for you. Now that people have recognized the serious threat Montana poses to the conference, it looks like teams don’t want to be blind-sided like they were last season. \nWith Breunig winning Big Sky Newcomer of the Year last season, after averaging 16.7 points and 7.3 rebounds, he will be the undoubted court leader for the Grizzlies. The German Giant can rebound, effectively defend the post, and possesses great athleticism for a big man, with nice handling and obvious dunking ability. \nMario Dunn was an honorable mention in the Big Sky last year, and is a true fan favorite for Montana. The Compton-native is an all-around stat stuffer, with a great knack for rebounding as a point guard. Griz basketball fans have surely been longing to see him take to the court since last spring, but they received a bit of unfortunate news last week when it was revealed that Dunn will be out indefinitely due to offseason surgery that corrected complications from a prior surgery, an operation he had for a scaphoid fracture he suffered last season. \nDunn could be back before the Griz begin their schedule, but there is no timetable for a return and coach DeCuire was quoted by the Missoulian saying “He’ll miss some time, but we’re not sure how much.” \nThis throws a big question mark into the mix for UM, and hopefully Dunn can make a quick recovery. Regardless though, the team is in capable hands behind Breunig and Riley Bradshaw and new Griz signees will have to step up if Dunn indeed misses time. But even with Dunn’s status up in the air at this point, the BSC was still correct in labeling Montana a top dog coming into the season. \nWith that loss last March still certainly brewing somewhere in the back of the Griz basketball organization’s mind, the team has to be motivated like they haven’t recently been. A desire to get back to the top, a coach ready to prove he can once again masterfully lead his alma mater, and a post player from Germany eager to play some basketball. Sounds like fun to me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T09:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:18:04.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
