They were also teammates on the Oregon Ducks . The two teamed up for a bizarre touchdown that helped the Panthers defeat Tampa Bay and remain unbeaten Sunday.\nStewart ran for eight yards on a play before he was hit by Buccaneers safety Chris Conte and fumbled. The ball popped straight up into the air and Dickson - in the right place at the right time - managed to tip the ball toward himself before snagging it in midair and running 57 yards for a touchdown.\n\"I was in the right spot and took it and kept running,\" Dickson told the Charlotte Observer. \"I didn't know if it was legal or not. I just took it to the end zone . If they were going to call it back, they were going to call it back. I was getting in the end zone.\"\nHuh? Jonathan Stewart fumbles the ball, Ed Dickson plucks it out of midair and takes it 57 yards for a TD! #CARvsTB http://t.co/Whfflvh8Kz\nâ€” NFL (@NFL) October 4, 2015 -- Geoffrey C.
