She herself was married to a NBA baller; until today when the announcement of their divorce was made final. \nAccording to Famecrawler: \nIf the whole infidelity thing wasn’t bad enough, the fact that Brent Barry was Tony Parker’s former team mate took the betrayal to a whole new level. \nBrent Barry will pay ex-wife Erin Barry child support until 2013, and they will share custody of their two children. \nNow that Erin Barry’s divorce from Brent Barry is official, will she hook up with Tony Parker? The damage has already been done, and Brent Barry and Eva Longoria know about the affair and have moved on with their lives. \nAccording to the Jersey Chaser: \nSports Illustrated reporter Bryan Armen Graham revealed on Twitter that Erin Barry, Brent Barry’s wife, is the other woman in the Tony Parker-Eva Longoria divorce. Erin Barry is accused of having an affair with Parker. Longoria confirmed to friend Mario Lopez that she found out about her husband’s cheating after finding hundreds of text messages on Parker’s phone with another woman, who she said was the wife of one of Parker’s teammates. \nAccording to her profile on WAG Rankings, a website that rates athlete’s wives: \n“Erin Barry is Brent Barry’s wife. Erin Barry has reached the sort of legendary status among San Antonio Spurs fans that few sports wives ever attain. She is, in many ways, the Jamie Kotsay of basketball. Erin and Brent support a number of charities, but their most public involvement has been with the Spurs 5k run/walk, which they have hosted every year since its inception. The race raises money for the Spurs Foundation, which works to prevent child abuse in the San Antonio community.” \nPaul M. Banks is CEO of The Sports Bank.net , a Midwest webzine.
