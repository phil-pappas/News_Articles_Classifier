The move envisages outsourcing health services to private players where possible thereby supplementing government funding with private investment and improving expenditure in the area. The framework is being developed to attract private partners to run sub-centres and primary health centres under the National Rural Health Mission, provide diagnostic facilities where possible, train human resources in health and build hospitals and infrastructure. Another possible area for outsourcing is hospital cleanliness and waste management. The Tribune has learnt that the framework for PPP in health is in active consultation with the government hoping to roll it out by December-end. It will be operationalised through a PPP cell in the Health Ministry. “The idea is to facilitate private investors who don’t know where to go if they want to partner with the government in healthcare delivery. PPP models are being developed for NRHM services; medical education; human resource training and infrastructure augmentation. Even today we have private presence in the health sector with over 70 per cent medical colleges being private. Creation of a national framework will facilitate transparent investment and better delivery. The framework will roll out through a PPP cell being planned in the Health Ministry. We are eyeing a December deadline,” a top government official said. At present, there is no central framework to enable private entities to invest in health although some states are pursuing their own PPP models to offer health services. States can currently seek funding under the National Rural Health Mission”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:10:49.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
