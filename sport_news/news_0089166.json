The department said in an information sheet on its website that the scores declined primarily because this year's test reflected more challenging standards, particularly in math. \nJoe Mancini said the state exams required students to know math instruction that previously had been introduced two or three years later in the educational process. \nBoth superintendents said they were pleased, given the circumstances, with their districts' performances on the tests, as students tested above state averages almost completely across every grade level. Exceptions were that Ellwood City's seventh-grade math scores (of students now in the eighth grade) were below average, as were Riverside's scores in fifth-grade math (of students now in the sixth grade). \n\"We've done well over the years,\" Anney said. \"I'd like to think we did as well this year under the circumstances.\" \nBecause of issues over the math portion of the PSSAs, the Department of Education will issue school performance profile scores only for schools that have 11th grade students. The school performance profile scores were introduced last year and will be revived again with the spring 2016 test. \nConsequently, only Lincoln Junior-Senior High School and Riverside High School will receive school performance profile scores for this year. \nMancini said the state will use this year's scores as a benchmark for future comparisons but will not compare the 2015 test marks to those of prior years. \nBoth districts' high schools will still receive school performance profile scores -- which include test scores and other factors to provide a school ranking -- because the Department of Education will be able to use the Keystone Exams in compiling scores. \nThe Department of Education has not yet posted the Keystone Exam scores online, but districts are expected to release the final figures at their school board meetings this month. \nFull results for every school in the state and the \"Five Key Points Parents Should Know About the 2015 PSSA\" document can be found online at http://www.education.pa.gov/Pages/PSSA-Information.aspx#.VgxI7H08rgw .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:27:59.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
