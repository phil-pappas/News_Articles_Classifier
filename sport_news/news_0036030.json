The box office was reopened from scratch, and just 42,058 showed on the short notice with events such as weddings, fishing trips and the like scheduled months in advance. LSU’s opponent was also not as worthy as Florida as the Gamecocks came in at 2-3 and 0-3 before losing, 45-24. \n“The game that passed — it felt like the spring game,” LSU tailback Leonard Fournette said this week. \nThis Saturday is different. LSU will be hosting a top-10 pairing for the first time since the No. 5 Tigers lost to No. 1 Alabama, 21-17, in the final moments nearly three years ago. The Tigers lost their first scheduled home game to weather and have won their three previous three home games by an average 22 points. This one projects to be much closer as LSU is a touchdown favorite. \nFournette, who graced the cover of Sports Illustrated this week as he is running away with the Heisman Trophy early forecasts, has never played in such a nationally significant game with SEC West, SEC Championship Game and College Football Playoffs implications. \n“It’s going to be crazy this weekend,” he said. “It’s a special moment, man. And I want you all to know, the tickets cost $110. I tried to buy one for my Auntie. I told her I couldn’t do it. It cost $110. I want you all to know that.” \nAll major college football players are given a limited number of tickets for family and friends. \n“Yeah, but my family’s big,” Fournette said. “She has to wait. I don’t know. I need a sale. I need the price to go down. But the price went up. So, next game, Auntie.” \nLSU tickets are more expensive for premium home games such as Florida. Fournette’s extended family members may have to be satisfied with the lower priced tickets for Western Kentucky a week from today. \n“It’s going to be a great atmosphere out there,” Fournette said. “Coming out there and competing, man, ain’t no better feeling than playing in Tiger Stadium.” \nAP Lightning strikes near Tiger Stadium during a weather delay Saturday.

Kickoff was also at 2:30 p.m. \n“It wasn't really arousing to us,” Fournette said. “But I know for sure, this game is going to be crazy. It’s going to be very intense.” \nThe sun is expected to set Saturday at 6:33 p.m., likely during the first quarter. Temperatures will be in the high 60s or low 70s. \n“It will be dusk,” LSU coach Les Miles said wistfully. “There will be the opportunity for night to arrive, and this should be a great game, a very competitive game. This is a top 10 match-up. This is Tiger Stadium at its best, and we expect that the fishing trips are done. We are coming to Tiger Stadium.” \nFlorida will be without blossoming freshman quarterback Will Grier because of a season suspension he received on Monday for taking performance enhancing drugs. But sophomore Treon Harris is a dual threat who started the season opener and six games last season. \n“That’s what is fun about coaching is putting the pieces together for the guys that are in there,” first-year Florida coach Jim McElwain, a former two-time national champion Alabama offensive coordinator, said. \nThe Gators also field the SEC’s No. 2 defense against the run with 99.2 yards allowed a game, while Fournette is the nation’s leading rusher with 1,022 yards and 204 yards a game. \n“Well, I know I couldn’t tackle him,” McElwain said. “Very excited about the opportunity to go into a great place to play at night against a team that obviously is as good as anyone in the country. They do things right, and they know how to win.” \nLSU and Florida will meet as top 10 teams for the fifth time since 2006. The winner of this game won the national championship or reached the national championship game in 2006, ’07, ’08 and ’11. \n“We’re just ready to play. They’re going to be here Saturday. We’re going to be there. So whatever happens, happens,” LSU safety Rickey Jefferson said. \n“This is why you come here,” LSU defensive tackle Christian LaCouture said. “Both physical football teams trying to move up in the standings and trying to get in the College Football Playoff. Doesn’t get much better than this.” Buy Photo \nThe LSU Tigers face the Auburn Tigers in an NCAA football game at Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, La., Saturday, Sept. 19, 2015.
