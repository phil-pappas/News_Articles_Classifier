And playing in Brooklyn (where the cost of living is, you know, insane), he wanted to make sure he didn't blow all of his money on housing, so he got himself a couple of roommates in order to share the expenses.\n“You can live in a nice, three-bedroom condo with all that in Dallas for like two thousand bucks,” he told The Wall Street Journal . “Three bedroom, three-bathroom in New York, you’re paying eight grand. It’s ridiculous.”\nAs it turns out, Hollis-Jefferson was being frugal for a reason.\nHe and his brother surprised their mother by buying her a house for her birthday, and caught the entire thing on video. Hollis-Jefferson explained how it all went down in a piece he wrote for the New York Post :\nWe were searching for the house for a while. My brother, the realtor, my uncle and a couple others were looking at houses and telling me about it, and I thought this one was the perfect fit.\nWhen I told the woman who owned the house why we were buying it, she cried. Being a mom, she understood what it meant more than us guys do. It was an emotional moment, and then she said, “We can make this happen.” They even bought my mom a cake!\nWe had a lot of our close family and friends and relatives at the house to surprise her. My sister was driving my mom to the house, and we told her to just knock on the door and ask for one of your friends.\nThe realtor opened the door and said, “Oh, who are you looking for?” When my mom said the name, the realtor said, “Oh, OK, come in.” Then everyone popped out and said, “Surprise!” and me and my brother had the cake, and she just started crying. To actually be able to show her the house and stuff on her birthday, it was a dream come true. It was a blessing.\nSend all complaints, compliments, and tips to sportstips@complex.com", "external_links": ["http://nypost.com/2015/10/24/nets-rookie-stars-in-own-version-of-mommas-house/", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/rondae-hollis-jefferson-seeks-a-smooth-transition-to-the-nba-1442343927"], "published": "2015-10-26T21:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:23:36.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
