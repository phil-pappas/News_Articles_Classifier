The Stallions (10-3) needed overtime to defeat the 2-8 Eagles 17-14 a year ago.\n“I told the kids that when you look at the history of this series, it almost always comes down to a few plays in each game that decides the difference between winning and losing,” DeSales coach Ryan Wiggins said. “Every game seems to be very physical and goes right down to the wire.”\nWatterson has allowed only 48 points, 27 of which came in a loss to top-ranked and defending Division III state champion Cleveland Benedictine last week.\nDeSales leads the series, which includes six playoff meetings, 36-22-1. The rivalry dates to 1963.\nBest of the rest Walnut Ridge (3-2, 2-0) at Eastmoor Academy (3-2, 2-0) Eastmoor won eight straight meetings in this East Side rivalry from 2004 to 2011, but Walnut Ridge has taken the past three. The winner will gain a leg up in a City League South championship race that includes Independence.\nLancaster (5-0, 2-0) at Groveport (4-1, 1-1) Groveport has made significant strides after going 7-33 from 2011 to ’14, but its four victories have come over teams with just one combined victory. Lancaster has won 15 straight games in the series.\nPickerington Central (3-2, 1-1) at Pickerington North (3-2, 1-1) This game usually is for larger stakes. This time, it’s for survival in the Ohio Capital Conference Ohio race and Division I playoff contention. Central leads the series 6-3, including a 30-23 overtime victory last year.\nReynoldsburg (3-2, 1-1) at Gahanna (4-1, 2-0) Gahanna can’t afford to look ahead to its week seven showdown at OCC Ohio co-leader Lancaster. Reynoldsburg is fighting to stay in playoff contention.\nHilliard Davidson (4-1, 2-0) at Westland (4-1, 2-0) Westland hasn’t played host to a game this significant since 2006, when it last posted a winning record and made the playoffs. Davidson has won 17 straight meetings in the series, dating to 1995.\nWesterville Central (5-0, 2-0) at Hilliard Bradley (3-2, 1-1) Westerville Central appears to have smooth sailing ahead until a week nine showdown against Hilliard Darby. Warhawks quarterback Gavin Lyon is questionable because of a shoulder injury.\nTeays Valley (3-2, 2-0) at Hamilton Township (4-1, 2-0), 7 p.m. These teams and Logan Elm appear to be the favorites in the Mid-State League Buckeye Division, which produced five playoff teams a year ago. Teays Valley handed Hamilton its only league defeat (35-21) in 2014.\nJohnstown (5-0, 0-0) at Northridge (4-1, 0-0), 7 p.m. Both teams are perched atop their respective divisions in the Dispatch -coaches polls.
