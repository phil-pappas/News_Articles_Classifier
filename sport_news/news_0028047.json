It's worked really well and he's done a great job.\" \nLeusmann is a native of Germany who grew up just outside MÃ¼nster, where he played soccer for 13 years before coming to the United States. Now employed at Ball State, he said he was always interested in coaching and when the position became available, he was approached about being hired. \nIt was more responsibility than he was anticipating. \n\"Being responsible for the results, for the logistics, for getting players on the field, it's quite the daunting task,\" Leusmann said. \"It was throwing me into the cold water, but I liked it.\" \nThe new coach also brought a change in attitude. Tellez said that under the previous coach, players messed around during practice and didn't have a serious mindset. \nHe called them \"jokesters,\" and the situation changed once Leusmann was in charge and directed practices with more authority. \n\"People stopped screwing around in practice,\" Tellez said. \"We started practicing a lot more technical ability, there's a lot more passing and strategy. \n\"There was anxiety when our new coach came in, but things felt unstable with our old coach. A lot of us were thinking, 'How are we going to do from here on out?'\" \nBurris (10-5-2) responded by winning the sectional and faces Crawfordsville (9-9), something Tellez said wouldn't have happened without Leusmann . The atmosphere changed so much that Tellez said he wouldn't be surprised if some of those \"jokesters\" were named team captains next season. \nIt's a testament to Leusmann's coaching, someone who had coached younger players but never coached at the high school level until now. \nAfter a few practices, players started adjusting to the new system he brought in and success followed. Through the process, Tellez said the players have gained respect for the new coach. \n\"I've learned a lot about myself, and I'm glad I've been able to get the players to trust me,\" Leusmann said. \"It's been a great experience and I've enjoyed all of it.\" \nContact prep sports reporter David Polaski at (765) 213-5848 or email him at dpolaski@muncie.gannett.com.
