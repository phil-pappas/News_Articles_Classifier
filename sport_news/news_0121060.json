Fort responded as Jared Collins raced 76 yards on the Indians’ first play and the score was 7-6 after the run failed. \nCody Warner raced 80 yards on the kickoff and the Knights were back in front 14-6. The Indians then drove deep into Knights’ territory but fumbled at the TA 19. Fridley then hit speedster Brenan Hanifee on an 81-yard TD pass that made it 20-6. With the catch, Hanifee broke the school record for receiving yards in a season. \nThe Indians came right back with a drive that resulted in a 5-yard TD run by Trenton Campbell to make it 20-12. De La Cruz then returned the kickoff 90 yards for a score and the Knights were back in front 27-12 at the end of the first. \nTA got three scores in the second with Warner scoring on runs of 10 and 94 yards and Jarrett Price added a 2-yard score and the Knights were comfortably in front 48-12 at the break. \nCollins rushed 12 times for 170 yards and Campbell had six carries for 61 yards for Fort in the first half. Warner tallied 134 yards on five rushes to pace TA. \nHanifee completed his brilliant night with two more TD catches in the third on plays of 41 and 53. Collins scored Fort’s last points on a 39 yard run in the fourth. \nCollins had a game-high 214 yards rushing on 16 carries and two scores while Campbell added 61 yards and a touchdown for Fort. Warner paced the Knights with 148 yards on seven rushes while Hanifee had 175 yards on three catches and three scores. \nThe Indians (0-6) will host Spotswood next week, while the Knights (5-2) are on the road at Waynesboro. \nFORT DEFIANCE 12 0 0 7 — 19 \nTURNER ASHBY 27 21 14 7 — 69 \nFirst quarter \nTA — De La Cruz 13 pass from Fridley (Lowry kick) \nFD — Collins 76 run (run failed) \nTA — Warner 80 kick return (Lowry kick) \nTA — Hanifee 81 pass from Fridley (run failed) \nFD — Campbell 5 run (kick failed) \nTA — De La Cruz 90 kick return (Lowry kick) \nSecond quarter \nTA — Warner 10 run (Harris pass from Warner) \nTA — Warner 94 run (kick failed) \nTA — Price 2 run (Lowry kick) \nThird quarter \nTA — Hanifee 41 pass from Fridley (Lowry kick) \nTA — Hanifee 53 pass from Fridley (Lowry kick) \nFourth quarter \nFD — Collins 39 run (Lowry kick) \nTA — Anderson 11 run (Lowry kick) 8 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.newsleader.com/story/sports/high-school/2015/10/09/ta-scores-big-win-fort-defiance/73696114/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:29:56.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
