The ref was not even close to it.\"\n\"Yes, he had to jump away,\" Lahyani responded.\n\"What can you do these days?\" Kyrgios asked.\nThe violation came at a critical time with the Australian serving at 4-5 in the second set. He dropped his serve at love, losing the set. He went on to lose the match, too, 1-6, 6-4, 6-4.\nAfterward, a much calmer Kyrgios said he didn't think he behaved that badly.\n\"I didn't hit the ball in anger. I just hit it,\" he said. \"Obviously it was pretty close to the line umpire. It wasn't out of rage or anything.\"\nKyrgios has been under scrutiny since he made comments to Wawrinka in Montreal about his friend, fellow Australian tennis player Thanasi Kokkinakis, having slept with Wawrinka's girlfriend.\nAfter an investigation, the ATP said it would impose a fine of $25,000 and a 28-day suspension from tour events if Kyrgios incurred any fines for \"verbal or physical abuse\" or received up to $5,000 in fines for other offenses before the end of February.\nThe Australian will now have to wait to see if his latest code violation results in another fine.\n\"I probably shouldn't have done it. But I didn't think it was too bad,\" Kyrgios said. \"I don't know, can't really change it now.\"", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:49:46.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
