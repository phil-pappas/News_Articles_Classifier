The attack was also witnessed by two passersby.\nThe alleged victim and witnesses told police Ward was agitated with the man for taking too long to get his food order, and that after following him outside, shoved him, punched him in the face, and — after the man had fallen to his knees — threw a bottle and food at him.\nWard is accused of then kicking the victim, straddling him and beating him with his fists.\nHe didn’t stop until a woman outside the taqueria screamed at him — and then he fled the scene, according to a police report. The woman then called police.\nWhen apprehended, Ward told cops that he had asked the man “to please hurry up with his order” because he “was taking a long time,” and was then challenged to take their quarrel outside, according to the police report.\nWard, a 10-year veteran of the department who Brookline police Lt. Philip Harrington said was off-duty at the time of the incident, was released on personal recognizance by Judge Mary Dacey White. White ordered him to have no contact with the alleged victim or witnesses.\nBrokaw had requested $10,000 bail.\nThe alleged victim was treated at Beth Israel Hospital.\nDEVELOPING...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:46:43.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
