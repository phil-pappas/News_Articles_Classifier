Photo by Charlotte Wilder If you want to see some action this weekend during the Head of the Charles Regatta, head to the Eliot Bridge. It’s close to the end of the race, so you’ll get to see exciting finishes. But it’s also notorious for boat crashes thanks to a precariously long curve in the river leading up to it.\n“People do crash,” said Henry Palmer, head coach of the Union Boat Club. “They crash at the Eliot Bridge a fair bit because they get that turn wrong.”\nThe bridge connecting Fresh Pond Parkway to Storrow drive isn’t the only place where boats get into trouble on the 3-mile-long course. The Weeks Footbridge and the Larz Anderson bridges also give rowers a hard time.\n“If you look at a map, it’s an S—you turn one way quickly and less than 100 meters later, you’re turning the other way, and people get jammed up,” Palmer said.\nThe most offending bridges. Google Maps You might be thinking that by “expensive,” we’re talking somewhere in the ballpark of a couple thousand dollars, right? Not so much. A boat that seats eight people can cost in the neighborhood of $50,000. The price tag on a a nice single can run around $14,000.\n“They’re expensive toys,” Palmer said. “Buying a racing single is a bit like buying a top-end road bike. You go, ‘Holy s---, these are expensive!’ It’s largely why masters rowing is very big, because it’s old gentlemen with fancy equipment floating down the river. They love it.”\nFortunately, it’s usually not a sunk cost when boats collide with each other or large structures. Palmer explained that it’s usually the oars that suffer the most in a crash. If the boats do get damaged in a collision, the damage is usually easily repairable.\nThe most dangerous time for a boat, it turns out, is actually when it’s being transported from race to race.\n“There was a case a few years ago where a tree fell and landed on trailer and smashed all the boats,” Palmer said.\nThe key takeaway here? Watch where you’re going, and don’t park your rig carrying hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of boats underneath a tree.\nShare 0 Tweet 0 Advertisement After Confederate flag battle, South Carolina senator questions Mass. banner 10.15.15 | 3:45 PM Hiker reported missing in New Hampshire 10.15.15 | 3:03 PM At Head of the Charles, boats worth $50,000 try not to crash 10.15.15 | 1:56 PM Haverhill police arrest 19 people, recover 15 guns in investigation with feds 10.15.15 | 1:44 PM Teen charged with murdering teacher will be evaluated at state hospital; trial on hold 10.15.15 | 12:06 PM Mass.’s unemployment rate dropped in September 10.15.15 | 11:47 AM Big Dig springs big leaks 10.15.15 | 9:27 AM After nearly 11 years, St. Frances parishioners ordered to leave church 10.15.15 | 8:59 AM Delays on Mass Pike inside Prudential Tunnel 10.15.15 | 8:58 AM Those upside-down billboards are being turned around 10.15.15 | 8:57 AM Marco Rubio used Mike Dukakis to diss Democrats 10.15.15 | 8:41 AM Google is bringing its ‘Street View’ to the Charles 10.15.15 | 8:36 AM Report: Feds questioning legality of daily fantasy sports 10.15.15 | 7:38 AM BU creates task force to address faculty diversity 10.15.15 | 5:59 AM Here’s Don Orsillo’s first day with the San Diego Padres 10.14.15 | 10:34 PM The Lincoln Chafee frog scandal that undermines his one strong debate moment 10.14.15 | 10:09 PM Man convicted of killing South Boston grandmother sentenced to life without parole 10.14.15 | 9:52 PM Harvard student sets new Guinness record for standing on a workout ball 10.14.15 | 9:42 PM Caramel apples are breeding ground for listeria, researchers say 10.14.15 | 7:16 PM Sen.
