Remember, the conditional start players will depend on your roster and league parameters. Use those in conjunction with our weekly rankings to build your best possible lineup, and check out our rest-of-season player rankings as you ponder midseason trade targets. • Join our $2,000,000 Week 5 fantasy football league. First place wins $150,000 this week! Sponsored by FanDuel Indianapolis Colts at Houston Texans\nMust start: Frank Gore, Arian Foster (groin), T.Y. Hilton, DeAndre Hopkins, Texans DST\nA couple of injured stars highlight this Thursday night game. One of them, Andrew Luck, will miss his second straight game with a shoulder injury. The trickle-down effect on Hilton and Donte Moncrief cannot be ignored, and is partially responsible for Moncrief’s exclusion from this section. Matt Hasselbeck was serviceable in his first start, but he was dealing with a virus earlier this week that actually had him in the hospital. We could see Gore’s first true workhorse game for the Colts. Hilton, meanwhile, is no more than a low-end WR2. Gore could have his first true workhorse game. As for Foster, last week was prelude to him getting back on the field at full strength. Roll him out with confidence. And Hopkins owners should get ready for another 15-plus targets.\n​ Fantasy Video Fantasy rest-of-season rankings: Evaluating NFL players for 2015 by Michael Beller", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/Mbeller", "http://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_8361b_1143c_&affid=5767&siteid=8361&adid=1143"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:33:50.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
