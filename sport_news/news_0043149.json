The club faces the Milwaukee Wave at 10 a.m. Thursday, then at the Chicago Mustangs on Friday. \n“We’re working on some things,” Rampage forward/assistant coach Carlos Farias said. “Get these guys to go one-on-one because in indoor, that’s the way it is. We’re teaching that first. As soon as they get the mindset of defending, the offense is going to come.” \nThe offense was slow in coming during the loss at St. Louis. After a scoreless first quarter, the Rampage netted seven goals over the final three frames. The first Rampage goal — and thus, the first in franchise history — belonged to former Iowa City West prep Spencer Nash. \n“It was good to get that started,” Nash said. “And once we got that going, everyone kind of got in. It was just great to get that goal, but good to see everyone else score.” \nNash is one of a handful of unsigned players that received an invitation to training camp. \nAfter graduating from West in 2009, Nash played collegiately for the University of Iowa men’s soccer club team. Last season, he served as a volunteer assistant for the Iowa women’s varsity team. The St. Louis game was his first exposure to the indoor game since he was a youth. \n“With these guys having played in the league before, it was great to kind of hear what they had to say and their input,” Nash said. “They really kind of showed me the way there and kind of led me. It’s a great group of guys to get out there and play with and it’s been great to play in this competitive atmosphere again with all these guys.” \nThe Rampage have signed a couple of players who aren’t expected to join the team until next week. Midfielder Corey Adamson — who scored 10 goals last season with Milwaukee — will be counted on as a veteran scoring presence once he arrives. \nThursday will also be the first action for Farias, 39, who reported to the team Oct. 7. The veteran forward — winner of five indoor titles, including being named MVP of the 2009 championship game with Monterrey (Mexico) — will also wear the hat of assistant coach. \n“I’m going to try to let the guys know the things that I’ve learned all these years that I’ve been playing,” Farias said. “Just to help them, give them advice.” \nThe club is still seeking a third option at goalkeeper after recent signee Alexis Apodaca — an honorable mention all-MASL rookie last season with the Ontario Fury — tore his right ACL on his first day of practice. \nSteven Hamersky — who played at Wichita last season — and Patrizio Paradiso of Rome, Italy are the current goalkeepers in camp. \nl Comments: douglas.miles@thegazette.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:01:02.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
