Hosi Koniyo was in a rickshaw when some masked gunmen shot him at least thrice, the second such attack in less than a week. \"It appears to be a target killing. The Japanese gentleman died instantly,\" Rezaul Karim, the officer in charge of a local police station, said. The Japanese national had been staying in Rangpur for the past six months and was a known face in the neighbourhood because of his philanthropy. He was headed to farm he had set up in partnership with another businessman on the outskirts of the city when he was killed, eyewitnesses claimed. \"Koniyo was alone in the rickshaw. They shot him in the chest, shoulder and hand and then immediately fled the scene on a motorbike,\" said an eyewitness. The rickshaw puller, Koniyo’s business partner, landlord and another resident of the area were briefly detained for questioning, Meanwhile, police have also set up check posts to arrest the assailants. The attack comes within a week Islamic State killing an Italian aid worker, Cesare Tavella, in an almost identical in Dhaka's upmarket Gulshan. While Bangladesh government had dismissed Islamic State’s claim calling it a “one-off” case, intelligence and security forces have yet to rule out the possibility of the jihadists using local sympathisers for such attacks. Bangladesh, a secular country with a predominantly Muslim population, has been grappling with rising Islamic radicalism in the country. It has banned several hardline groups believed to have been behind killing some secular bloggers in the country earlier this year. Four secular bloggers have been killed in this year alone — the last one being in August this year — for what radicals have called “anti-Islamic” writings. Australia, Britain and the US issued travel advisories to their nationals visiting the country. The Australian cricket team also recently postponed their planned tour to the country citing security concerns after Tavella's death. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:34:51.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
