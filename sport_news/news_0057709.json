The Virginia Tech defensive end broke one in the preseason and has jammed fingers on the other. For games, his fingers are taped together.\nSo taking down quarterbacks has been problematic. A senior season that came on the heels of a nine-sack junior campaign has produced zero sacks in a frustrating seven games for the preseason All-ACC pick.\n\"Right now, it's kind of like he's 'Lobster Boy' out there or something,\" said defensive line coach Charley Wiles, referencing a character on the TV show \"American Horror Story: Freak Show.\"\n\"He doesn't have any grip, to a certain degree.\"\nIt's not what anyone envisioned for the 6-foot-3, 223-pounder, who was projected as a potential late first-round pick coming into the season in a hybrid pass-rushing role.\nHe ranked second in the ACC in tackles for a loss (18.5) and third in sacks (9), trailing only Clemson star defensive end Vic Beasley in tackles for loss and Beasley and teammate Ken Ekanem in sacks. He also made 70 tackles.\nBut this year's numbers are modest by any measure: 20 tackles, with only one tackle for a loss, despite multiple opportunities.\n\"It's the dangedest thing I've ever seen this year for him,\" said defensive coordinator Bud Foster, who noted that Nicolas has to be better about wrapping up and not relying on pulling people down with his hands. \"He's been in good position. He's got some good pressure. So you don't want to dwell on it too much.\n\"It's kind of like a guy that fumbles. You don't talk about it too much. The next thing you know, he's fumbling all the time. So we're just going to keep playing hard and hope to finish plays.\"\nDespite the lack of sacks, Nicolas, who declined an interview request this week, has gotten positive reviews for his play. Wiles said Nicolas was the defensive line's top performer last week in a grading system that accounts for factor plays, even if a player isn't necessarily the person who brought the ballcarrier down. Nicolas had four tackles, including a tackle for a loss against the Hurricanes.\n\"He could be through roof,\" Wiles said. \"I mean, if he finished all the plays that he's been in on... he'd probably have five or six sacks.\n\"He's being Dadi other than he hasn't finished some of those sacks that he's had. But all over the field and running and getting off blocks. Being a big-time factor out there. I know if you're the opponent looking at video, you're like, 'We've got to block that kid.' \"\n\"I think Charley has done a great job of letting him understand that he may not have gotten the sack, but he's the reason the sack was made,\" Foster said.\nLast week's Miami game illustrated the frustrations. Late in the game, Nicolas had a free shot at a sack, but flew past Miami quarterback Brad Kaaya trying to go for a strip sack on a key third-down play. He whiffed after Kaaya pulled the ball down, then completed a third-down pass near the goal line that helped set up a game-sealing touchdown.\n\"It's just a millisecond away from a strip sack,\" Ekanem said.\nHe understands how Nicolas feels. The junior, who led the team with 91?2 sacks last season, had five straight games to start this season without a sack. He finally broke through with 11?2 sacks against N.C. State two weeks ago.\n\"It's frustrating all the way around,\" Ekanem said. \"We both like pass-rushing. And I was getting frustrated.... So I know it's killing him inside a little bit. But he doesn't really show it. He's enthusiastic in practice and before games. He does a really good job in handling it.\"\nThis might be a hard week to break out of that slump. Duke has allowed four sacks all year, tied for the fifth-fewest nationally. The Blue Devils protect well, teach their quarterbacks to get rid of the ball quickly and rarely put themselves in third-and-long situations.\nVirginia Tech was able to capitalize on some pass-rushing situations in last year's 17-16 upset at Duke, a game that turned on a play in which Nicolas hit quarterback Anthony Boone's arm, causing a fluttering pass to be intercepted by linebacker Derek Di Nardo and returned inside the Duke 10.\nIt was Nicolas' best game of the season. He finished with nine tackles, 31?2 tackles for a loss, 21?2 sacks and the forced interception on 1 of 2 quarterback hurries.\nThe Hokies would love to see him break out of his sack slump with a duplicate performance Saturday.\n\"Dadi's been playing his heart out,\" Wiles said. \"He's been good. Now he just has to finish some of those plays. I can see it happening.\"\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image. Buy Pilot photos here. \n\nLoading...
