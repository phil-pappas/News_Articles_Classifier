(AP Photo/Julie Jacobson) \nNEW YORK (AP) — A person familiar with Chase Utley’s appeal says the hearing for the Los Angeles Dodgers second baseman has been scheduled for Monday. \nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity on Tuesday because no announcement was authorized. \nThe timing means Utley will be eligible to play for the rest of the best-of-five NL Division Series against the Mets. New York took a 2-1 lead into Game 4 Tuesday night at Citi Field. \nUtley was suspended two games for his rough slide in Game 2 that broke the leg of Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada. He was on the bench and didn’t play in the Dodgers’ 13-7 loss Monday night. \nJohn McHale Jr., the baseball executive who will hear the appeal, informed MLB and the players’ union of the timing on Tuesday.
