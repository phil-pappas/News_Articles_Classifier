Wherever I can help out the team that will give a chance to have a ball in my hands, which I like to do, I would love it.” \nHead coach Mike Pettine said he hopes his success as a kick returner will give him some more confidence. \n\"We’re happy for him that he’s put the work in and he’s practiced well,\" said Pettine. \"He did get results on the field, and we’re hoping that’ll energize him when the time comes for him to play corner for us that he’ll be just as effective.” Copyright 2015 Scripps Media, Inc.
