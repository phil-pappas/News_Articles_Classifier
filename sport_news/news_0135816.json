By Curtis Pashelka Posted: 10/22/2015 02:31:38 PM PDT Updated: 10/22/2015 02:31:39 PM PDT SAN JOSE -- Raffi Torres said he simply wasn't thinking when he delivered a head shot to Jakob Silfverberg of the Anaheim Ducks in a preseason game earlier this month. \nIn his first interview with reporters since he was handed a 41-game suspension by the NHL for the hit on Silfverberg, Torres said Thursday he feels he still can change that part of his game, thought he didn't have much of a case for an appeal and has had support from his teammates and general manager Doug Wilson. \n\"I'm disappointed in myself for kind of losing my head for a second there, and it cost me,\" Torres said inside the Sharks' dressing room at SAP Center. \"So I'll try and put it behind me. I'd be lying if I said I didn't think about it three times a day. ... I put a lot of pressure on myself to be better, to be smarter and I made one mistake out there and it cost me. \n\"I understand that the history didn't help, either. I feel like they had a job to do. I'll deal with it.\" \nTorres took part in the Sharks' morning skate before the team faced the Los Angeles Kings to start a three-game homestand. Torres will not be eligible to return to the NHL until Jan. 14, 2016 when the Sharks host the Edmonton Oilers, and is forfeiting $440,860.29 of his salary this season. \nTorres was given a 10-minute misconduct and a match penalty for his hit on Silfverberg, Torres' left shoulder made direct contact with Silfverberg's face after he released the puck. \nIt was Torres' fifth suspension in his NHL career. He's also been warned twice for illegal hits and fined three times, and his past transgressions played a major role in the punishment. Advertisement \n\"I kind of knew right away,\" Torres said. \"It's one of those things where I need to be staring at the guy's chest, not his head. \n\"Like I said, I kind of lost my train of thought for half a second and I was coming a little too quick and once I saw him pull up, I was, 'Aw, man.' It's hard for me to pull out of those hits. I know I can do it. I just made that one mistake.\" \nTorres said he talked with his agent and the NHLPA regarding a possible appeal. But considering his history with suspensions, and that NHL commissioner Gary Bettman had already reduced his 2012 suspension for a hit on Marian Hossa from 25 to 21 games, Torres didn't feel like it would be successful. Any appeal would've first been heard by Bettman. \n\"It wasn't like this time it was a high stick or a low hit. It's the same hit over and over again,\" Torres said. \"You have to put yourself in their shoes and they feel like 'This guy's just not getting it.' Hopefully this one will be the last and I can try and put it behind you as best you can.\" \nTorres said that he's received support from his teammates and that he talks to Wilson on a regular basis. Wilson signed Torres to a three-year, $6 million contract before the 2013-14 season, but Torres has only played five regular season and seven playoff games since he signed the deal. \n\"I like him around the team,\" Sharks coach Pete DeBoer said. \"He's a good teammate, he's a good guy. The guys respect him, and it's nice to have him around.\" \nTorres has had two major knee surgeries and missed the entire 2014-15 season. He had another surgery in February. \n\"I know why he signed me here. I know what it was to do, and I feel disappointed, like I've been letting him down the whole time,\" Torres said of Wilson. \"He's a big help. He says a few things to me daily, and it helps. It helps me out big time. He keeps me pushing, he keeps me working to know that one day, I'll be able to pay him back.\" \nTorres was bombarded with criticism in the hours and days following the hit, with some calling for him to be suspended for the season or even banned for life. \n\"I've never cared about what people thought about me. If I did, I wouldn't be in the league right now,\" Torres said. \"People that are writing this stuff and putting all this stuff on Twitter, I just kind of think for a second, what kind of people these are. So it just makes me laugh. It gives me more fire inside to come back and play.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:02:36.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
