Little does he realise that he is up against a long history of cleanliness that just happened, without much effort from Indians. Never did Indians, through their history, need to have campaigns of the Swachh Bharat type. There simply were not too many Indians in India to make it grimy. Even open defecation was not the kind of shameful, but unavoidable, public activity in historical times as it has become now. If there are very few people around, privacy and distance from others is not something that needs to be especially engineered. It just happens. In the past, all that the Indians needed to do was to find an open space and the waste took care of itself. Around 330 million Indians living in the land between the Himalayas to the southern seas is a very different thing from 1,200 million Indians living in the much-truncated area that we call India today. This densification of living creates requirements that Indian society had never handled before in its entire existence. The simple task of having 500 toilets in one acre, which is the kind of density that exists in many parts of our big towns, simply changes the scale of things. It means designing sewer systems with the appropriate slope; connecting each house to the sewer drain; setting up a sewage treatment plant and so on. The reality is that there are towns that have sewer drains but no treatment plant, and still others where the sewer drains and plant both exist but the houses have not been connected to the drain. Soon enough, the town begins to drown in its own waste. If one town had defaulted we could have talked of inefficiencies and corruption, but if almost all default then one needs to look deeper. See when Modi set up a task for cleaning up India under Swachh Bharat, how the bureaucrats translated it as the task to build toilets. After all, absence of toilets and the corresponding open defecation was the greatest of eyesores for India. Even the WHO had begun to say that this practice compounded the illnesses that hounded Indians. Actually, building toilets was the easy part. What was difficult was to build systems to manage the toilets, keep them in working condition on a daily basis and ensure that the waste, f√¶cal and other solid, was properly disposed off. Building systems, however, does not come easy to governments in India. Social systems there are aplenty to regulate marriage, work relationships and kinship ties. All of them work on a very small scale, involving a few thousand people at the maximum. Even the military on its campaigns was divided up, with each soldier cooking his own meal and praying separately. Grand religious festivals like the Kumbha, where people thronged in lakhs, were a picture of unmanageable chaos, often resulting in hundreds of deaths that have been recorded in history. It is only now have we been able to learn how to manage the Kumbha systematically. Building systems requires the ability to plan ahead and think in abstractions. But, somehow, we in India find that very difficult to do. Working piecemeal is easy in comparison and that is how urban settlements in India have worked. So whatever money is available is allocated and spent every year, without the existence of any master plan that might provide order to the chaos. Even where master plans are created, these are rarely followed. Cities like Gurgaon had no sewer system till 30 years after it came into existence and which still does not have an adequate city-wide sewer system, is ample testimony to this cultural disability.The focus has been has been almost entirely on blaming Indians for being dirty. Government advertisements exhort people to be clean and to use toilets. Some experts even opine that Indians only bother about ritual purity. This merely amounts to blaming people for the dirt in which they find themselves. So why do Indians find it difficult to build large-scale systems? Does it have anything to do with the fact that traditionally India has existed in tiny communities? Those communities might have had some economic linkages with each other but organisationally speaking, these were self-contained, much like Mumbai town of nowadays is. The writ of the Indian king did not really run here. So if 2,000 years ago, a merchant's son wished to join the Buddhist sangha, he had to seek not only the permission of his parents but also of his guild. And sreni dharma was given a similar status to varnashrama dharma. Whether caste, guild or local board, these were the entities which exercised substantial control over the life of citizens. The authorities of the state did not matter. Only the code of the local community carried any weight. In later times, it seems that some communities even had the authority to impose the death penalty, even though a monopoly over violence should be the single-most important feature of state systems. Existence at such a small scale meant there was little need to build systems to manage a larger population size. The king certainly did not seem to have essayed any such task. Even the grand Mughals mostly left local communities undisturbed, much as the British would do later. Everyone was welcome to handle life their own way. About all that the British did, (and what a game-changer that was), was to introduce a common code for dealing with criminal activities. Indians were comfortably living in small communities of a few thousand houses of a bunch of people who knew each other directly. But, modern living is different. There are numerous systems that need to be structured formally. Whether it is sewage-management systems or traffic-control systems or healthcare systems; all these require the ability to think and plan for the next 30 years at least and to put protocols in place that ensure routine maintenance.It is this ability to design systems and build protocols for their maintenance that seems to be missing in the Swachh Bharat Mission. Anyone who has ever visited a public toilet would testify to this. With Swachh Bharat, Modi has put his fingers on the pulse of the nation, as it were. Now if he can only find a way to address this cultural dysfunctionality, he will genuinely go down in history as a path-breaking leader.
