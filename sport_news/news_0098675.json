I have nothing more to say other than to reiterate that I feel terrible about Ruben's injury. Now my teammates and I are focused on Game 3 and doing everything we can to win this series.\" \nUtley was suspended by Major League Baseball after officials determined that he made an illegal slide to break up a double play in the seventh inning of Game 2 on Saturday night in Los Angeles, flipping shortstop Ruben Tejada's into the air and breaking his leg. \nMORE: Tejada won't need surgery \nUtley has the right to appeal, and under collective bargaining rules, is eligible to play while the appeal is pending. And with Utley's agent pushing for more time to prepare for the appeal, the slow-walking could keep Utley active for the rest of the best-of-five game series. \nThis presents the Mets and starting pitcher Matt Harvey with a dilemma: Although Harvey has vowed to \"do what's right,\" should he risk being ejected and also receiving harsh discipline from MLB ? \nBut there is no dilemma for fans, who will be ruthless toward Utley. \nKevin Manahan may be reached at kmanahan@njadvancemedia.com .
