Heads of government from 54 countries would be staying in New Delhi for the summit, one of the most important international meets organised by India after NAM and CHOGAM in 1983. Sources said ITBP dog teams were scrambled to the Capital after the intelligence establishment had intercepted electronic chatter indicating a possible terror plan to target the meet that begins next week. A very high threat perception was sounded and a tight multi-agency security blanket is being thrown around the city. The ITBP is providing the largest number of dog teams, which would carry out anti-sabotage checks at places where the visiting dignitaries would be staying and attending various events, an officer said. The K-9 teams have already started combing operations, he added. ITBP K-9 units consist of Malinois, Labradors and German Shepherds, who are considered the most elite anti-sabotage dog squads in the country, having undergone a revolutionary type of training devised by ITBP at its National Dog Training Centre at Bhanu near here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:10:24.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
