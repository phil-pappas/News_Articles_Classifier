(AP) - Now that the New York Giants have learned how to finish games, it’s time to take the next step. \nTom Coughlin’s team has to start stringing together wins, starting with a game against a team not playing very well, the San Francisco 49ers. \nOn the surface, Sunday night’s game looks easy. The Giants (2-2) go for their third straight victory and look to hand the reeling Niners (1-3) their fourth straight loss in the nationally televised contest at MetLife Stadium. \n“There’s plenty of next steps, believe me,” Coughlin said of his team’s improvement. “But the next step is the continuation to execute well, the continuation to play well together, to understand the opponent.” \nIn this case what the Giants have to understand is that San Francisco and new coach Jim Tomsula are desperate to right things. It’s a position the Giants were in recently after blowing their first two games in the final minutes. \n“There’s always tough spots,” Tomsula said. “Every season, every year, every career, there’s tough spots. To me, you’ve got to go through them. You don’t go around them. So, roll it up and go through it, keep going.” \nCoughlin has warned the Giants that the 49ers played in the Super Bowl in February 2013. While many players have left, a number still remain and they know how to win. The 69-year-old coach also said the Niners didn’t look like a 1-3 team in their loss to Green Bay last week. \n“A play here or a play there and they are in position at home to win,” Coughlin said. “So you do have to be aware of those things, but I don’t pay any attention to that. They’re 1-3 and they’re desperate to win. And we’re desperate to win.” \nThe start is the 49ers’ worst since 2010. San Francisco has been limited to 28 points in the skid while giving up 107. \nHere are some things to watch in this game: \nBAD BECKHAM: Don’t be surprised if Odell Beckham Jr. comes up big. The Giants receiver was criticized by the Bills for being a “prima donna” last week and he was fined almost $9,000 for throwing a jab at Buffalo safety Duke Williams after being blocked on an interception return. With his image tarnished, expect the 2014 Offensive Rookie of the Year to make amends. \nTENTATIVE KAEPERNICK: Colin Kaepernick’s every drop back is being scrutinized. Tomsula is taking heat for not considering a switch to give Blaine Gabbert a chance to right an offense that has been awful in three straight losses. \nKaepernick has thrown five interceptions over the past two games and taken eight sacks. His wide receivers, Anquan Boldin and Torrey Smith, are hardly hiding their frustrations. \n“I don’t play for job security,” Kaepernick said. “Whether football is here or not, I will be fine. I go out, I play to win.” \nWACKY DEFENSE: The Giants have a split personality on defense. They are No. 1 in the league against the run, yielding an average of 69.8 yards. The pass defense is dead last, No. 32. Opponents are throwing for an average of 316.3 yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:49:38.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
