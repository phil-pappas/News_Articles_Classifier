Jones started all but one game at defensive tackle last year. Their departures left two spots vacant, specifically inside. \nThe hiatus presented an opportunity for junior Torrey Dale. \nThe defensive end played in 13 games in his first two seasons. He combined to make six tackles. \nThis year at defensive tackle, Dale has made seven tackles in seven games. \n“It’s not been anything I can’t handle. I’ve got coach (David) Turner teaching me everything I need to know about playing inside,” Dale said. “I’d say the biggest adjustment is having a guy outside of you, taking on more double teams. You get used to it, but it’s definitely a major adjustment.” \nDale played on the outside throughout the spring. The move came during practices in August. Defensive line coach David Turner asked Dale to move inside in the middle of a walkthrough just weeks prior to the season. \n“I guess I did all right,” Dale said. \nThe defensive tackle position is often a thankless one. Part of the role is to take on double-teams and allow the defensive ends to feast on single blockers. \nThe Kenner, Louisiana native didn’t record a tackle in his first two games this season. He has seven in the last five games. \n“I mean that really helps being in there with guys like A.J. (Jefferson) and Ryan (Brown) who are veterans,” Dale said. “They help lead me in the right direction.” \nDale is listed in the Mississippi State guide at 252 pounds. He’s up to 273 since the move inside. He’s still the lightest defensive tackle on the roster compared to Chris Jones at 308 pounds or Nick James at 325 pounds. \n“I play stronger inside because I just know that there’s someone from the outside that’s probably going to come block me as well as the guy I’m going against,” Dale said. “Making the move from outside to inside, I’m about 273 so I’m a little D-tackle.” \nBut, he’s quicker than most D-tackles too. \n“I’d say I come off quicker than your average D-tackles. You’ve got some freaks like Chris Jones, he’s pretty fast,” Dale said. “I say I give them a challenge with my speed.” \nContact Michael Bonner at mbonner@jackson.gannett.com.
