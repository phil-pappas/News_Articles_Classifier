Both sides are eager to continue collecting as many points as possible ahead of November.\nToronto FC is still in search of a guaranteed home playoff date while Wednesday night's visitors are in position to claim the Supporters' Shield.\n\"We know the possibility of us doing something that has been a goal from the beginning is closer to becoming reality,\" Herculez Gomez said.\n\"We have to take care of business first. New York is a very good team. I personally consider them one of the better teams in MLS. It's not going to be an easy task facing them.\"\nWith both Jozy Atlidore and Sebastian Giovinco away on international duty, it's likely Gomez will feature prominently alongside Luke Moore up front.\nBoth players have been used sparingly ahead of what will likely be a massive opportunity.\n\"It's big,\" TFC head coach Greg Vanney said. \"I look forward to seeing guys step up. This is a real opportunity for guys to see how they'll play into the equation as we move down these really important games coming up.\"\nSights form Tuesday's pre-match training session brought about massive questions as well.\nAfter being released from U.S. national team camp Sunday afternoon, Michael Bradley didn't take part in full training.\nNew York bench boss Jesse Marsch told reporters this week he believes Bradley picked up an injury during Saturday's CONCACAF Cup final.\nVanney, though, chalked up Bradley's potential absence to fatigue, leaving him questionable ahead of TFC's potential playoff-clinching fixture.\nThe potential absence of all three Designated Players leaves Vanney in a precarious situation.\nHis top two scorers are missing. His captain, potentially. And Robbie Findley didn't take part in full training Tuesday.\nAgainst a high-pressing team that's going to compete from start to finish midweek, the Reds will undoubtedly miss having that level of experience.\n\"They love to press,\" Gomez said. \"They love to make the opponent give up silly balls in their end. They counter very quickly and capitalize. They are a very fit team.\n\"If you play into their game and that tactic, they're going to be a better team.\"\nThey're always ready to out-compete the opposition.\n\"You have to be patient,\" Gomez said. \"They're betting that their frantic pace will outdo your frantic pace; That their all out will be better than your all out.\"\nAnd, that their lineup will overwhelm whatever's trotted out against them. Similar to what happened the last time these two sides met.\nSince then, Vanney has moved away from the 4-1-2-1-2 (diamond midfield) formation. There's more clarity in the club's shape.\n\"We've shifted out of a diamond,\" Vanney said. \"We feel the matchups will be a lot clearer. We feel like we'll be able to get good pressure on them around the field and make the game more difficult on them.\"\nIt be hard to make it any easier than it was the last time these sides met.\n\"We should play with a huge chip on our shoulders,\" Gomez said. \"We should make it a goal to not just make the playoffs, but compete in the playoffs.\"\nTo compete, you have to be able to hang with the top teams at home.\nHere's TFC's chance to prove it can.\nKICKOFF - NEW YORK RED BULLS @ TORONTO FC - 7ET - TSN\nMARQUEE MATCHUP\nHerculez Gomez (TFC) vs. Damien Perrinelle (NY)\nGomez hasn't made as much noise as expected after joining Toronto FC mid-summer.\nBut with Jozy Altidore and Sebastian Giovinco away on international duty, the Reds need Gomez more than ever late in the season.\nThe former U.S. international recognized this as his opportunity to show he doesn't belong on the bench.\n\"If that opportunity happens tomorrow night that would be great,\" Gomez said Tuesday. \"It would be something I've been working towards since I got here. It hasn't been easy.\"\nHe'll be matched up against hulking centre-back Damien Perrinelle Wednesday night.\nGAME NOTES\n-Sebastian Giovinco, who impressed in a second-half cameo for Italy Tuesday in Rome, has been texting TFC staff in an effort to play a role in Wednesday night's match. He is schedule to arrive back in Toronto a few hours before the match.\n-Jozy Altidore, who remained with the U.S. national team Tuesday night, arrives back in Toronto early Wednesday and is in contention to make the bench Wednesday night.\n-Red Bull New York is missing defenders Karl Ouimette (Canada) and Matt Miazga (U.S.), as well as midfielder Lloyd Sam (Ghana) due to national team duty.\nLARSON'S LINEUP\nMoore Gomez\nWarner Osorio Cheyrou Delgado\nMorrow Perquis Williams Jackson\nKonopka\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nMLS\nTFC meets Red Bulls with a lot on the line Reds looking to clinch berth; Visitors want to sew up East\nBy Kurtis Larson , Toronto Sun First posted: Wednesday, October 14, 2015 10:09 AM EDT | Updated: Wednesday, October 14, 2015 10:18 AM EDT\nAsk anyone at Red Bull Arena that night.\nAnd, for that matter, any other night Toronto FC has travelled to face Red Bull New York.\nBack on Aug. 15, the Reds were run off the pitch by the Energy Drinks.\nIn a stinging 3-0 setback TFC was out-shot, out-possessed, out-coached and out-competed.\nThe Reds were, well, out-everything'd.\nTwo months on, Toronto FC hosts the Eastern Conference leaders in one of its biggest league fixtures to date.\nThere's something riding on this one for both teams.\nThe Reds need a single point from their final three regular-season games to clinch a playoff berth -- something they'd like to do in style in front of home support.\nMeanwhile, New York needs a similar result to lock up top spot in the East.\nDon't expect a repeat of the \"Disgrace in Gijoin,\" though.
