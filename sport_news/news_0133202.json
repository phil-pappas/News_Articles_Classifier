After completion, the charges will be expunged from her record. Griner and Johnson were married on May 9, but Griner filed for an annulment less than a month after the fact.\nThe WNBA suspended Griner and Johnson for the first seven games of the regular season, though Johnson was on maternity leave.\nGriner was a two-time national player of the year for Baylor women's basketball, including leading the Lady Bears to a perfect 40-0 national championship season in 2012. She won her first WNBA Championship with the Phoenix Mercury in 2014.\nClick here to read the full statement from USA Basketball.\nOn Twitter:\n @ShehanJeyarajah", "external_links": ["http://www.usab.com/news-events/news/2015/09/usa-basketball-to-suspend-brittney-griner.aspx", "https://twitter.com/ShehanJeyarajah"], "published": "2015-09-30T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:00:33.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
