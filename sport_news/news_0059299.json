But I'm very very happy with the way we finished off the game. We can put a full stop now on the round robin and we are off to the finals,\" he added. \n\"We can't afford to make unforced errors so we will look at that and just keep building on our game and try to improve our skill execution.\" \nThere will be particular concerns about how their forwards again buckled under pressure, as they did against Georgia last week, which Australia would have noted after the way their pack excelled when beating England. \nIn the backs, most of the passes stuck and crucial tackles were made as they outscored Tonga seven tries to nil. \nBen Smith, Tony Woodcock, Milner-Skudder (twice), Sonny Bill Williams, Sam Cane and Ma'a Nonu in his 100th Test all crossed the line. Dan Carter landed six of seven conversions. \nIn the first half, every time it looked as if the All Blacks had Tonga on the ropes, the islanders fought their way back using their powerful pack. \nIn a dramatic end to the half Tonga were unlucky not to win a penalty try when stand-in All Blacks captain Kieran Read was yellow-carded for collapsing a driving maul. \nTonga, knowing they had the All Blacks forwards under the cosh, turned down a shot at goal in favor of a scrum.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:03:39.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
