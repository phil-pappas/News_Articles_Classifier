But Rose, who had posted a video of himself over the summer kicking a 70-yard field goal, missed the extra point wide right.\nRose walked off the field holding his head. Heard stood on the sideline with his hand on his hips in disbelief.\nHeard passed for 364 yards and ran for 163 and three touchdowns. He nearly had his helmet ripped off late in the third quarter when a rushing defensive lineman grabbed his facemask, but Texas (1-2) rallied from that point, trailing 45-24.\nKhalfani Muhammad ran for 164 yards for California (3-0), including a 74-yard touchdown.\nSherrington: 45-44 loss to Cal shows UT has lots to fix, but Strong has found a QB\nCarlton: Heard puts on a show, but ...
