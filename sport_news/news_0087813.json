A U.S.-led coalition has been targeting the Nusra Front and the Islamic State group for more than a year.\nThe Observatory's chief Rami Abdurrahman said it was not clear if al-Charekh was killed by U.S. or Russian warplanes. The Observatory, which relies on a network of activists inside Syria, said an Egyptian commander escaped the bombing. It said all four men had been dispatched to Syria by al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri.\nJihadi activists on social media say al-Charekh was killed by a U.S. drone strike.\nAl-Charekh, the alleged leader of al-Qaida's operations in Syria, was one of six men that the U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on last year. He was the 49th on a list of 85 most-wanted militants by Saudi Arabia who are outside the kingdom. The list, issued in 2009, includes 83 Saudis and two Yemenis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T11:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:04:37.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
