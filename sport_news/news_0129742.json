METS\nDetails/TV: Game 3 at New York: Monday at 5:30 p.m., TBS\nAmong the storylines they’re all frothy about in the New York media going into the next two games at Citi Field:\nFrom Mike Vaccaro in the New York Post : “If (Chase) Utley thought he was detested, despised and reviled in New York already, he has no idea what he’s in for. You thought it was ugly when John Rocker returned to the scene after his verbal hate crimes? Maybe you remember Pete Rose leveling Buddy Harrelson back in the ’73 playoffs, and the way he was treated the rest of his career at Shea Stadium? Those were Hallmark cards compared to what’s coming.”\nFrom Michael Powell of the New York Times: “Some press commentators mumbled that Utley’s slide was just ‘good old-fashioned baseball;’ we retreat into cliché to avoid thought. … (Utley) appeared to have one goal: to take out (Ruben) Tejada any way he could. And that is against the rules of baseball. … The sport’s ethos has never been to rattle brain pans and cause rib cages to collapse. It is not football, and thank God for that. … You hope that Matt Harvey, the next of the Mets’ strong young arms scheduled to step forward, realizes that he is of more use snapping Lord Charles curves and 98-mph fastballs in Game 3 than tossing at the cranium of some Dodger player. You also hope an old Met antagonist has not hijacked a series and taken it to a dark place.”\nFrom David Lennon of New York Newsday: “We can’t deny that Utley single-handedly reversed the momentum of this Division Series. He did. … Just don’t tell us it was a clean play, because it wasn’t. … Lawrence Taylor was easier on quarterbacks than what Utley did to Tejada, and now the unlikely pair have something in common. They both snapped an opponent’s leg in two.”\nGame 4 is 5 p.m. Tuesday at New York; If necessary, Game 5 is 5 p.m. Thursday at Dodger Stadium. The NL Championship Series begins Saturday.\nNO. 2: COLLEGE FOOTBALL\nUSC at NOTRE DAME\nDetails/TV: Saturday at 4:30 p.m., Ch. 4\nAfter USC’s Cody Kessler threw for 372 yards and six TDs during a 49-14 win last season over the Irish at the Coliseum, Trojans coach Steve Sarkisian exclaimed: “Our future is ridiculously bright. We’re going to be really good.” And now where are we? With the news of Sarkisian’s leave of absence, and the 3-2 Trojans having lost two of their last three to drop out the Top 25 polls, this annual rivalry game takes on a lot different context. Kessler, who was 32 for 40 passing and setting a TD opponent record against the Irish last season, comes off a game where he just 16 of 29 for 156 yards, no TDs and two picks against Washington in a 17-12 home loss. No. 14 Notre Dame comes in 5-1 after a 41-24 win over Navy. The Irish are ranked 14th in the nation in total yards average per game (504), two spots ahead of USC (495). This is the 86th edition of the rivalry, which Notre Dame leads 45-36-5 for the right to keep the Jeweled Shillelagh. Before USC lost the 2013 game at South Bend, 14-10, it had won the previous five in a row there.\nAdvertisement\nNO. 3: COLLEGE FOOTBALL\nUCLA at STANFORD\nDetails/TV: Thursday at 7:30 p.m., ESPN\nA year ago at the Rose Bowl, Stanford’s Kevin Hogan threw for 234 yards and two touchdowns as the 7-5 Cardinal crushed the Bruins’ hopes for the Pac-12 South title and a College Football Playoff spot with a 31-10 victory on a Friday night. Because of the Pac-12 title game, Hogan has already played four games against UCLA in his career — all wins — and has thrown for 776 yards with five TDs and only one pick. Funny these two should meet again on a weeknight — the first of back-to-back Thursday night games for the No. 18 Bruins (4-1, 1-1) that has coach Jim Mora’s suspenders in a bunch. Both No. 18 UCLA and No. 15 Stanford (4-1, 3-0), leading the Pac-12 North, had a bye week coming into this one.\nNO. 4: NFL WEEK 5\nPITTSBURGH at SAN DIEGO\nDetails/TV: Monday at 5:30 p.m., ESPN\nSome say the matchup to concentrate on is Steelers running back Le’Veon Bell against the Chargers’ Manti Te’o. Unless you’re lost in the whole world of apostrophes. San Diego has a strange connection to current Steelers QB Michael Vick: In 2001, the Chargers had the first pick of the NFL draft, but swapped choices with Atlanta, allowing the Falcons to take Vick. Satisfied instead with the No. 5 overall choice, San Diego took running back LaDainian Tomlinson instead.\nAlso: In Week 6, the Chargers go to Green Bay (Sunday, Ch. 2, 1:25 p.m.) and New England at Indianapolis (Ch. 4, 5:30 p.m.)\nNO. 5: NHL: KINGS vs. VANCOUVER\nDetails/TV: At Staples Center, Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., FSW\nWe haven’t counted the 0-2 Kings out. Yet. Outscored already 9-2 in their first two encounters, both at home, it leads to some obvious questions: Is Milan Lucic the wrong fit? Why does defenseman Christian Ehroff look so lost? And where’s the offense? It’s not as simple as Drew Doughty drew it up following the 4-1 loss to Arizona on Friday when he said: “The bottom line is we didn’t score enough goals.” Now come the 35-year-old Sedin twins, each with more than 1,000 regular-season games played since they came up in 2000. Lifetime against the Kings, captain Henrik has seven goals and 38 points with a plus-minus of 4, while assistant captain Daniel has 16 goals and 40 points with a plus-minus of 8. Jonathan Quick was 3-1-1 against the Canucks last year, giving up six goals in the five games.\nThe five-game season-opening homestand continues with games against Minnesota (Friday, 7:30 p.m.) and Colorado (Sunday, 7 p.m.)\nNO. 6: MLB PLAYOFFS: NATIONAL LEAGUE DIVISION SERIES\nST. LOUIS vs. CHICAGO CUBS\nDetails/TV: Game 3 at Chicago, Monday at 1:30 p.m. or 3 p.m., TBS\nThe last time the Chicago Cubs won a playoff game at Wrigley Field — Oct. 8, 2003 — Mark Prior got the win in Game 2 of the NLCS, a 12-3 triumph over Florida’s Marlins. Sammy Sosa hit a home run. The Cubs then went ahead and lost Games 6 and 7 at Wrigley. Then Game 3 of the 2007 NLDS against visiting Arizona. Then Games 1 and 2 of the 2008 NLDS against the Dodgers, as Derek Lowe and Chad Billingsley throttled them. This is Jake Arrieta’s turn to end that five-game skid. The Cubs have not lost a game when Arrieta was on the mound since July 25. Seriously. Remember how he did in the 2015 All-Star Game? Neither does he. He didn’t make the NL roster of 14 pitchers. Since the All Star break, he has gone 12-1 with a 0.75 ERA. Not counting the complete-game shutout over Pittsburgh in the NL wild-card game last week. With a 22-6 regular-season record, he is surprisingly just 9-5 at home in 15 starts this season with a 1.97 ERA.\nGame 4 is Tuesday at Chicago, Game 5 is Thursday at St. Louis.\nNO. 7: MLB PLAYOFFS: AMERICAN LEAGUE DIVISION SERIES\nKANSAS CITY vs. HOUSTON\nDetails/TV: Game 4 at Houston, Monday at 10 a.m., FS1\nThe Astros’ ability to snatch Game 3 at home behind Dallas Keuchel puts them in position to eliminate the defending AL champs. If Game 5 is needed, it happens Wednesday in Kansas City.\nThe American League Championship Series begins on Friday.\nAlso:\nToronto at Texas, Game 4 at Texas, Monday at 1 p.m., FS1\nAfter the Blue Jays avoided elimination, they’ll hand the ball over to knuckleballer R.A. Dickey to try to send the series back to Toronto for a final game on Wednesday.\nNO. 8: BOXING: GENNADY GOLOVKIN vs. DAVID LEMIEUX\nDetails/TV: At Madison Square Garden in New York, Saturday at 6 p.m. HBO pay-per-view\nWord of mouth has spread about Golovkin (33-0, 30 KOs), holding the WBA, IBO and WBC middleweight belts, from his recent fights at the StubHub Center and the Forum. Now he’s in line to supposedly take over the spotlight of the “pound-for-pound” champ since Floyd Mayweather Jr., has “retired,” and they’re ready to test the pay-per-view crowd to see if he’s reached that golden plateau. Lemieux (34-2, 31 KOs), the IBF middleweight champ, is only one of many middleweights who are trying to attach themselves to “GGG.” After this bout, middleweight fights featuring Saul “Canelo” Alvarez-Miguel Cotto (Nov. 21) and Danny Jacobs-Peter Quillin (Dec. 5) are lined up.\nNO. 9: MLS: GALAXY vs. PORTLAND\nDetails/TV: At StubHub Center, Sunday at 4 p.m., Fox Sports 1\nThe last home game of the regular season for the Galaxy (15-10-6). Last time Portland (12-11-8) trudged down here, they were handed a 5-0 loss in late June.\nNO. 10: NBA EXHIBITION\nLAKERS vs. SACRAMENTO\nDetails/TV: At MGM Grand, Las Vegas, Tuesday at 7 p.m., TWC SportsNet\nIt’s another reason to venture over to Vegas, this time for a game that’s not jammed into the UNLV campus gym.\nAlso this week: Lakers vs. Golden State (at Valley View Casino Center in San Diego, Saturday at 7 p.m., TWC SportsNet and Clippers vs. Charlotte at Shanghai, China, Wednesday at 5 a.m., NBA TV).\nAbout the Author Reach the author at thomas.hoffarth@dailynews.com or follow Tom on Twitter: @tomhoffarth .\nFull bio and more articles by Tom Hoffarth Back to top", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/12/sports/baseball/chase-utley-mets-ruben-tejada-slide-dodgers-phillies.html?_r=0", "http://www.newsday.com/sports/columnists/david-lennon/be-on-payback-alert-for-chase-utley-s-rough-play-1.10947153", "http://nypost.com/2015/10/11/utley-is-about-to-find-out-what-happens-when-you-play-dirty/", "http://twitter.com/tomhoffarth", "http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/persbilde?Avis=LA&ID=33"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:18:07.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
