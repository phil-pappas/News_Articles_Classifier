Under the expanded relationship, Georgia Tech was named a Siemens Center of Knowledge Interchange partner, joining a group of eight research universities. The partners are set to work on a project to enhance the company’s human-simulation software.\nThe Siemens Foundation has collaborated with Georgia Tech’s Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics and Computing for more than 15 years. Siemens has also provided Georgia Tech access to software for its engineering curriculum valued at more than $200 million. The partnership has also focused on improving K-12 science and math education in underserved communities. The school has partnered on more than 20 projects with the company over the past three years in manufacturing, health care and energy.\nAt The Atlantics Bold Bets: Eric Spiegel, right, president and CEO of Siemens USA, talks with Jilda Garton, vice president, research and general manager, Georgia Institute of Technology Applied Research Corporation and George “Bud” Peterson, president of Georgia Institute of Technology, before the Commercializing the Cosmos event where aerospace leaders discussed opportunities and challenges in the next great space age.
