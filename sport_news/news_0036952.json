Back | Next 2006 FILE PHOTOGRAPH/THE CAPITAL-JOURNAL A 36-pound catfish caught in 2006 helped Virgil Brown, of Olpe, and Earl Murphy, of Madison, win a catfishing tournament at Manhattan's Tuttle Creek. By Josh Rouse joshua.rouse@cjonline.com \nI received an email this week from Kathy Damron, of Topeka, about her 3-year-old French bulldog, Gigi, that’s worth sharing. \nAccording to Kathy, Gigi is a native Kansan and “trusted advisor.” \n“Really, there’s very little she can’t do,” she said. “She always has time to listen, is consistently generous with her affection and demonstrates great appreciation for each and every meal. How many people can you say that about?” \nAside from being fond of mealtime, Gigi also enjoys watching Kansas basketball with Kathy and enjoying the great outdoors. \n“We live in Topeka, enjoy walking in our fair city and never bark at other dogs,” Damron said. “Ours is a pretty simple story, but sweet nonetheless.” \nWell Gigi, I too appreciate a great meal and watching Kansas basketball, so you may have just what it takes to be the next Dog of the Year. I mean, how could I say no to that smile? \nIf you’d like to submit your pooch for the Dog of the Year contest, send an email to joshua.rouse@cjonline.com with your dog’s name, photo and story, as well as your own name and location. \nVIRGIL BROWN MEMORIAL — A memorial fishing tournament will take place from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Oct. 24 at the John Redmond Reservoir to honor Olpe angler Virgil Brown. \nThe cost will be $50 per boat, and the event will pay out for first, second and third place, as well as for the biggest fish. \nFor more information on the memorial tournament, contact Ty Wolf at (620) 341-2129. \nAs an interesting side note to this event, which I learned about after Phil Taunton from KVOE radio in Emporia emailed me the flyer, I actually covered an overnight catfishing tournament in 2006 that Brown won at Manhattan’s Tuttle Creek while I was working a semester at the Kansas State Collegian. \nBrown and his fishing partner, Earl Murphy, of Madison, stole the show in that tournament. The defending champions were the last team to arrive for the weigh-in, and when Murphy pulled a 36.65-pound flathead catfish out of his livewell, the crowd gasped. \nBrown and Murphy totaled 98.70 pounds of catfish, outpacing the second-place team of Topeka’s Jim Diehl and Alma’s Delmar Thowe by 17.1 pounds. It was one of the largest catfish I’d ever seen in person, and a tribute to how great Brown and his teammate were at fishing. \nTo read my coverage from the 2006 tournament, go to http://tinyurl.com/ot8gqld . \nJosh Rouse can be reached at (785) 295-5660 or joshua.rouse@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:49:34.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
