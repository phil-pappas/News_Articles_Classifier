He was claimed off waivers by Oakland last season, but was cut before this season. New England re-signed him to the practice squad last month, but released him a few weeks later. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:44:50.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
