Three adults were pronounced dead at the scene, while the fourth victim, a two-year-old boy, died from his injuries at a hospital, according to a Stillwater police statement. Nikita Nakal (23) of Mumbai was identified as among the victims of the accident yesterday by University of Central Oklahoma (UCO) President Don Betz. Authorities identified the driver as 25-year-old Adacia Avery Chambers, who was taken into custody on suspicion of driving while under the influence of alcohol. Chambers drove through barricades set up for the Oklahoma State University’s homecoming parade before she crashed into the crowd, the police said. She first hit a police officer’s motorcycle and then rammed her car into the parade-goers packed on a street corner. Three adults were pronounced dead at the scene, while the fourth victim, the young boy, died from his injuries at OU Medical Center Children’s Hospital, according to a Stillwater Police Department statement. Police named the adult victims as Nakita of Edmond and 65-year-old Stillwater residents Bonnie Jean Stone and Marvin Lyle Stone. Of a further 47 people treated after the crash, 17 remained hospitalised and five were in a critical condition. Some of the victims are children, they said. Megan Lantz of Ponca City, Oklahoma, told the Oklahoman newspaper that about 100 people were standing on the corner at the time the car, going between 72-80 kmph, struck the crowd. Mayor Gina Noble and Stillwater City Council said, “we are heartbroken about the tragedy, and our hearts and prayers are with the families of those who died and are injured.” In a statement posted on the University of Central Oklahoma website, Betz expressed condolences to the family of Nakal. “Nikita Nakal of Mumbai, India, an MBA student at UCO, was among those who died,” he said in the statement. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:07:45.157+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
