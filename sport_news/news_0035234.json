The league now goes as far west as Alaska. \nNorfolk returned to the ECHL as part of a chain of events that began with the American Hockey League forming a Western Division, hoping to bring affiliates closer to the NHL’s western squads. \nThe franchise that became the Admirals — the Edmonton Oilers’ ECHL affiliate — was 26-38-3-5 as the Bakersfield Condors last season. It was sixth in the seven-team Pacific Division. \nThe new Bakersfield Condors are in the AHL, one step above Norfolk in the Oilers’ organization. Last season’s Admirals — the Anaheim Ducks’ AHL affiliate -- are now the San Diego Gulls. \nOf last year’s Bakersfield team, Josh Currie (42 points in 71 games), Jonathan Lessard (41 points in 60 games) and Chase Schaber (33 points in 51 games) are the highest scorers who will begin the year with the Admirals. \nAmong goalies, Ty Rimmer (8-11-1-2 with a 3.20 goals-against average) played regularly for Bakersfield and is now an Admiral.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:05:33.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
