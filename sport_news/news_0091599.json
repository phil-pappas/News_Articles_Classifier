(Photo Credit: Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images) \nHere are the New York Giants who earned a game ball with their effort against the Buffalo Bills in Week 4: \nKerry Wynn had his best day as a pro against the Bills. The second year defensive end from Richmond had eight tackles (seven solo) and two were for a loss. Wynn was all over the field making plays and he should be starting from this point forward even when Robert Ayers Jr. is healthy. \nDwayne Harris helped the passing game out with five catches for 51 yards and a touchdown. The wide receivers didn’t have a banner day against Buffalo’s secondary but if Harris can produce like this on a consist basis the Giants will be able to weather the absence of Victor Cruz . \nMarshall Newhouse In our game preview, we said that Newhouse had to limit Mario Williams if the Giants wanted to function on offense. Well, Williams had a fairly quiet day with just four total tackles. “He’s done a good job,” said Coach Tom Coughlin on Monday. “He’s come in and he’s worked hard and he’s been very good up front in terms of communication. He’s a smart guy. So he’s worked himself in very well.” Newhouse had a very solid performance and he definitely deserved a good pat on the back. \nRashad Jennings gets a game ball for his51-yard catch and run for a touchdown. It was by far the biggest play of his brief Giants career. Not only was it an amazing individual effort by Jennings but it couldn’t have come at a better time. The play gave the Giants a 14-point lead and took all the air out of the Bills and the crowd. \nCoaching Staff We haven’t hesitated from givingTom Coughlin and his staff some heat for their shortcomings earlier in the season. With that said, we’re objective and give credit where credit is due. Coughlin and his staff made the most out of their 10-day layoff before this game and it showed on both sides of the ball but especially on defense. The Giants shutdown Buffalo’s running game beautifully and other than tight end Charles Clay , they kept Tyrod Taylor and Buffalo’s passing game in check. \nFor more New York football insider news be sure to check out the new NUC at NFLDraftBible.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:58:09.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
