Tonight in the Mountain East Conference game of the week at Duval-Rosier Field, the Bobcats put on one heck of a show despite falling by a 31-27 score. Quarterback Ryan Deal (pictured) put on a performance for the ages as he threw for 473 yards and touchdowns with no interceptions. The 473 passing yards was the second best outing in the Mountain East Conference. Wesleyan had two receivers go over the 100-yard mark. Michael Anderson , out of the backfield, caught seven balls for 169 yards and a score. Wesleyan's offense racked up 555 total yards. Freshman sensation De'shaun Burgess continued his solid play after hauling in six passes for 117 yards and a score. The game looked like it was going to be a blowout in Fairmont State's favor after one-quarter of play. Fairmont State jumped out to a 24-7 after 15 minutes of action. Wesleyan's lone score in the opening quarter was a one-yard reception by Marcus Smith from Deal with 1:49 on the first-quarter clock. During the first quarter, the Wesleyan defense gave up 203 yards of offense. The lone score of the second quarter belonged to Wesleyan as Burgess hauled in a pass over the middle from Deal and went 75 yards for the score. The touchdown occurred at the 8:03 mark. Nick Banta 's point-after-try was blocked. The Wesleyan defense locked down on the Fairmont State offense in the second quarter as they gave up just 88 yards in the second 15 minutes. The two teams went into the intermission with Fairmont State leading 24-13. Wesleyan owned the third quarter with two scores as they took a 27-24 lead heading into the final quarter. Anderson hauled in a screen pass at his own 15-yard line and scampered 85 yards for the score with 8:17 showing on the third quarter clock. Wesleyan went for two on the conversion which came up short, but they cut the lead to 24-19. The Bobcats' second score in the quarter was a 27-yard touchdown reception by Anthony Okray that came with 3:23 on the third-quarter clock. Stephan Rogalski hauled in the two-point conversion pass that gave Wesleyan their 27-24 lead. Wesleyan missed a 42-yard field goal, and it took the Falcons just three plays to go 70 yards and retake the lead. Brandon Boyd caught a 20-yard pass for the score with 8:18 remaining in the game. That gave the Falcons a 31-27 lead. Wesleyan moved the ball on their next drive all the way down to the Fairmont State 25-yard line, but failed to complete on a fourth down and three pass with 3:59 remaining Fairmont State after getting the ball back ran out the clock. With the loss, Wesleyan dropped to 0-6 overall and 0-6 in the MEC. The Bobcats will return to action next Saturday, Oct. 17 when they host Urbana at 1:30 p.m. Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:08:00.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
