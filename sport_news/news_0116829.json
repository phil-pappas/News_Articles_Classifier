Well, you can't know of course, but there are some early indicators that you're going to have a great race day.\nLet me share them with you here while I tell you about Randy Bobe's great race at the Bank of America Chicago Marathon yesterday. The 39-year old Keller resident, husband and dad, is an underwriter with Ally Bank, a heck of a nice guy and a very accomplished runner. A few days before the race Randy wrote, \"This has been a flawless training cycle, hitting all my runs, no injuries and my weight has never been better. Everything under my control went well. I hope to run a fast race.\"\nSoon as I read this I knew he would nail it, for two reasons. First he went into the race in perfect shape. We don't always do this. There's often an injury along the way, or life gets in the way and we miss a workout or two. Then there's the problem of overwork, where we finish the training program feeling so much fatigue that we aren't rested and fresh on race day. Believe me, I've seen this happen with runners using a plan like Pfitzinger for the first time.\nAnd second, he was confident, and this is the big key to a PR. It wasn't the foolish confidence that we sometimes exhibit when we hope we have a good race but haven't done the work. Instead, this was the calm confidence of a well-prepared runner.\nHere is the most important thing that confidence will do for you in the marathon. It allows you to control the pace. You can run every mile at your goal pace with no deviation, no putting minutes into the bank, and no apprehension about the final 4 miles. You know you will have enough in the tank to finish strong and evenly.\nBefore Sunday, Randy's marathon PR was 2:48:59. On Sunday he ran 2:47:48, or 6:24 per mile, for a 1:11 PR. But he was running 6:21's at the halfway mark, which meant he hardly slowed at all. And better yet, he told me after the race that he ran the second half deliberately at that pace to ensure he'd get the PR. In other words, he ran conservatively so as not to blow up. You have to be very confident to do that. How often have you \"felt good\" between 13 and 18, only to slow dramatically at 20? That was a very well-executed race.\nLet me also suggest that a few seconds of that PR are owed to Randy's wife Danielle, his most avid fan. Nice going Randy and Danielle, and a big \"Well done!\" to all the DFW-area runners who ran superbly in Chicago yesterday.\nPreparation and confidence.\nSpareribs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:40:39.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
