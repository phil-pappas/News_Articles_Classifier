Among other things, the BJP has promised five decimal land to the landless for housing and laptop to 50,000 meritorious students and two-wheeler to 5,000 girls passing class X and XII examinations “We have prepared a vision document for bringing the state out of backwardness. It will serve as a roadmap for development of the state… We want the deprived sections of the society to be the beneficiaries of development. The Union Government will make the requisite resources available to complete the roadmap enshrined in the vision document,” Jaitley said while releasing the document. Apart from emphasising on agriculture, health, education and information technology sectors, the BJP said it wanted development of rural and urban areas alike, thus, focusing on environment, good governance and employment. Compared to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar’s seven-point development formula, the BJP has come up with 25-point agenda. It also includes a dhoti-sari for the poor and new agriculture and veterinary universities. A team of BJP leaders led by Union Agriculture Minister Radhamohan Singh has prepared the vision document following wide consultations with people going even to remote areas of the state. Making a scathing attack on the governments (Congress, RJD and JD-U) that ruled the state so far, Jaitley said: “They ruled the state for 68 years and always pushed it into backwardness. Neither electricity improved nor industries were set up, forcing the youth to migrate to other states in search of jobs. Electricity is a grave concern here.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:06:40.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
