The 36-year-old veteran filed an appeal that is expected to be heard Monday before Game 3 of the National League Division Series. If Utley loses his appeal, he would miss Games 3 and 4.\nThe punishment stems from a controversial play in the seventh inning of Game 2 on Sunday at Dodger Stadium. Utley slid late and reached high in a successful attempt to take out Tejada on a potential double-play ball. A replay review later ruled Utley safe at second base because Tejada missed the bag -- even though Utley also missed the bag -- and the play keyed a four-run, rally that led Los Angeles to a 5-2 lead.\nTejada's leg was immediately placed in an air cast, and he was carted off the field. The Mets replaced Tejada on their roster Sunday, calling up infielder Matt Reynolds to replace him.\n\"I recognize that there has been much commentary and many questions regarding the unfortunate play in last night's game in which Ruben Tejada was injured,\" Major League Baseball's chief baseball officer Joe Torre wrote in a statement Sunday night. \"As I said after the game, the determination of whether a runner has intentionally interfered with a player attempting to turn a double play is left to the judgment of the umpire on the field, and that judgment call is not subject to review.\n\"I should add that determining where to draw the line between an illegal slide and a legitimate hard play is an extremely difficult call for our umpires.\n\"However, after thoroughly reviewing the play from all conceivable angles, I have concluded that Mr. Utley's action warrants discipline. While I sincerely believe that Mr. Utley had no intent of injuring Ruben Tejada, and was attempting to help his club in a critical situation, I believe his slide was in violation of Official Baseball Rule 5.09 (a)(13), which is designed to protect fielders from precisely this type of rolling block that occurs away from the base.\n\"We have been in discussions with the Players Association throughout the year regarding potential rule changes to better protect middle infielders, and we intend to continue those discussions this offseason.\"\nUtley's agent, Joel Wolfe, responded with a statement that read, \"A two-game suspension for a legal baseball play is outrageous and completely unacceptable. Chase did what all players are taught to do in this situation -- break up the double play. We routinely see plays at second base similar to this one that have not resulted in suspensions. Chase feels terrible about Ruben Tejada's injury, and everyone who knows him knows that he would never intentionally hurt anybody.\"\nThe Mets issued a statement that read, \"The New York Mets completely support the decision made by Major League Baseball to suspend Chase Utley for two games and feel this was the appropriate course of action. With this decision behind us, the team and our fans can now focus on playing winning baseball.\"\nUtley did not start either of the first two games of the NLDS.\n  MLB: Philadelphia 6, L.A.
