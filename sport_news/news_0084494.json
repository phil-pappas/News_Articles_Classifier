By Connor Riley sports@onlineathens.com – published Sunday, October 11, 2015 Georgia not only lost to Tennessee 38-31 on Saturday but the Bulldogs also lost Nick Chubb. While Chubb is out for the season, he isn’t the only player facing injury concerns. \nLinebacker Jordan Jenkins missed most of the second half against the Volunteers on Saturday with what coach Mark Richt said was a groin injury. On his weekly Sunday teleconference, Richt said Jenkins is day-to-day but the team won’t know until later the severity of the injury. Jenkins leads the team with three sacks and 7.5 tackles for loss. -- Richt mentioned the Georgia running backs will have to step up in the absence of Chubb. He specifically said that Keith Marshall and Brendan Douglas will be in line to get more carries as Sony Michel shifts into the starting role. -- Richt brought up the low sack numbers by Georgia and put some of that on the score and down and distance. Georgia trailed for much of the Alabama game and never led in the fourth quarter of the Tennessee game. \n--Richt said Georgia will continue to tweak the punting game, specifically in the type of kicks the Bulldogs try to execute. Collin Barber had several rugby style, or lower to the ground, punts on Sunday which came with mixed results. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:12:14.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
