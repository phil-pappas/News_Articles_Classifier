When I think back to some of the seminal bands I’ve always loved, they all had at least two major records. Rudimental (Dan Harr/Invision) \n“I always dreamed of Rudimental having at least two major records – hopefully it will solidify to the world that we’re serious contenders in the game. We’re not going anywhere – we plan to stick around for a long time.” \nThe late Bobby Womack and Lianna La Havas joined Rudimental – made up of Amor, Piers Agget, Kesi Dryden and DJ Locksmith – for songs on their follow-up to 2013 debut Home. \nMeanwhile, Jess Glynne’s I Cry When I Laugh rose from five to three, David Gilmour’s former number one Rattle That Lock slipped one place to four, and this week’s top five is completed by Stafford rockers Editors, who earn their fifth consecutive top 10 album with In Dream. Tom Smith and Russell Leetch of Editors (Ian West/PA) \nIn the singles chart, Justin Bieber has returned to number one for a fourth week with What Do You Mean, marking its third separate stint at the top of the charts. It becomes only the fourth song in history to achieve this. \nSam Smith’s Bond theme Writing’s On The Wall has fallen to third place, while R City’s Locked Away feat Adam Levine scored a new Official Chart peak at number two. Justin Bieber is back at number one (Francois Mori/AP) \nPhilip George and Anton Powers’s Alone No More has become this week’s highest climber, ascending a massive 120 places to number four, trailed by Ellie Goulding’s On My Mind in fifth.
