(Photo: Jamie Germano/@jgermano1/, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER) Buy Photo Story Highlights The Rhinos are 1-0-1 vs. Louisville this season. Louisville has the USL's top scorer in Matt Fondy (24 goals) and scored a USL-best 55 goals. The Rhinos allowed a USL-low 15 goals and set a USL record with 17 shutouts. 12 CONNECT 10 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe Rhinos had the best defense and top goalkeeper in the USL this season. Louisville City FC had the most productive attack and top goal-scorer. So Saturday's USL Eastern Conference Championship match in Rochester is one of those classic matchups. \nThe unstoppable force meets the immovable object. Ready, set â€” go. \nCan Rochester's suffocating back four and goalie Brandon Miller halt Louisville's multifaceted attack and the USL's top finisher, Matt Fondy? But there's more to it than just that. The winner will host next Saturday's USL Championship because not only were the top-seeded Rhinos (18-1-10) and No. 2 Louisville (15-8-6) the best in the East, but also they ranked 1-2 in points in the 24-team league. \nSaturday's showdown is also a clash between the USL's old guard, the Rhinos, against one of the league's fresh faces in Louisville, an expansion franchise whose popularity in the Bluegrass State should stir memories of Rochester in 1996. Louisville averaged 6,765 fans at Louisville Slugger Field, a baseball stadium similar to Rochester's former home, Frontier Field. That ranked second in the USL, behind Sacramento (11,323) and ahead of the Rhinos (5,570). \nThe league has proudly promoted Louisville's success, something that has been noted in the Rochester locker room. \n\"It's kind of weird. With the season we've had, the media makes us look like underdogs. I think we've been overlooked a little bit, honestly,\" said Tony Walls, midfielder and team captain for the record-setting Rhinos, who matched franchise records for shutouts (17) and fewest goals allowed (15). \"But I try not to get too caught up in that. We have to just focus on what we can control.\" \nThey'll try to foil Fondy, a 6-foot-1 forward whose two goals in overtime last Saturday pushed Louisville past No. 3 Charleston, 2-0, before a franchise-record 8,517 fans. \"Honestly, I could feel them behind us the whole game,\" Fondy said before Friday's workout at Sahlen's Stadium. \"When the goals went in, the place erupted.\" \nThe Rhinos kept the Louisville crowd in check on April 16, rallying for a 1-1 tie. Fondy assisted on Juan Guzman's first-half goal before midfielder Alex Dixon tied it in the second half. In their only other meeting, Rochester won 2-0 at home on June 13 behind goals from its Offensive Player of the Year, midfielder Kenardo Forbes (43rd minute) and its top scorer, Steevan Dos Santos (67th). \nLike Fondy, Dos Santos is riding high after scoring both goals in the Rhinos' 2-0 playoff win over No. 4 N.Y. Red Bulls II. He could be a handful for a Louisville defense that ranked fifth in the USL. \nFondy, 26, a fifth-year pro, is a California native who broke in with Pittsburgh (USL) in 2011, then spent a couple seasons with the L.A. Blues (USL) before trying to catch on in the MLS. His 22 regular-season goals are trumpeted as a league record in the \"new\" USL. Apparently, the merger between the A-League and USL about a decade ago dissolved somewhere over the past few years. \nThat's why Rhinos' standards such as Doug Miller's 23 goals in 1997 and Pat Onstad's 16 shutouts in 1998 aren't recognized by the USL. It's why Miller's 13 shutouts this season are also considered a league record. \n\"That player is hungry every game and you've got to deal with him every game,\" Rhinos coach Bob Lilley said of Fondy. \"We did the first two games, (did) a pretty good job on him. He was still dangerous and I expect he'll be dangerous tomorrow. We have to be on our toes and give him the respect he deserves because you fall asleep one minute, he'll punish you.\" \nFondy has good speed, strength and knack for being in the right place at the right time. \"He's dynamic, his movement is good,\" Miller said. \nBut the Rhinos' defense has made a habit of making potent forwards look ordinary. \n\"They work really hard. They work for each other. Their communication is good,\" Fondy said. \"They've got some good center backs that have been causing me some trouble.\" \nFrom its team color (purple) to its style of play, Louisville may resemble former USL power Orlando City in more ways than one. That's because rookie head coach James O'Connor, 36, played for Orlando City from 2012-14. He brought a couple of former teammates with him in Aodhan Quinn, a midfielder who'll try to dictate tempo with veteran Guzman, and Bryan Burke, a midfielder whose 10 assists were tops in the USL. Kadeem Dacres (6 goals/2 assists), Magnus Rasmussen (8/4) and Niall McCabe (4/1) are other threats. \nRochester will be without two key substitutes, both rookies. Forward Christian Volesky, the team's No. 2 scorer and a key off the bench, and defender Julian Ringhof are out with injuries. Depth has been a strength of this squad, so the Rhinos seem unfazed. Neither played in the playoff opener, either. \nThe Rhinos are 13-0-2 at home this season and have outscored foes 26-5. \n\"This team thinks that we've earned the right to be in this position,\" Rhinos Defensive Player of the Year Grant Van deCasteele said. \"We have an expectation to go out and play well on Saturday and if we do our job I think we'll be in a good spot.\" \nJDIVERON@Gannett.com \nUSL Conference Finals \nMatchup: No. 1 seed Rochester Rhinos (18-1-10) vs. No. 2 Louisville City FC (15-8-6) in the USL Eastern Conference Championship. \nWhen: 7:05 p.m. Saturday. \nWhere: Sahlen's Stadium. \nTickets: From $10. \nSeason series: Rhinos tied 1-1 in Louisville in April and won 2-0 in Rochester in June. \nAt stake: Hosting next Saturday's USL Championship vs. No. 2 OKC Energy or No. 5 L.A.
