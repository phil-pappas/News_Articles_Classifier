(Image Source: Stephen Dunn/Getty Images) \nHere’s a look at the questions that arose in Week 4: \n1) Can UCLA Make the Playoffs Despite Their Losses on D? \nHeading into the season, I thought the Bruins were a really intriguing CFB Playoff sleeper. However, when they lost LB Myles Jack for the season, joining DT Eddie Vanderdoes and CB Fabian Moreau , I thought the mounting injuries were too much. Having an impact interior lineman like Vanderdoes and a playmaking linebacker like Jack were two of the reasons UCLA could be a much-improved team this year despite the loss of their QB. Maybe it will catch up to them over the course of the season but after watching them throttle Arizona in Tucson 56-30—it was 42-14 at the half—I may need to rethink that. \n2) Which UT Knows Heartbreak Better…Tennessee or Texas? \nWow. For the second time this year, the Vols blew a double-digit fourth-quarter lead, this time in the final five minutes when they led the Florida Gators 27-14 (they led Oklahoma 17-3 with 10 minutes to go). Leading 27-21, Tennessee had Florida facing a 4 th & 14 from the UF 37-yard line when they gave up a 63-yard catch and run. Just wow. That doesn’t even cover Butch Jones’s decision not to go for two (up 12) with 10:19 remaining in the game or their inept clock management on their final drive (missed 55-yard FG on final drive). \nWow. Texas says not so fast to Tennessee. A week after a missed PAT wasted what should have been a 21-point fourth-quarter comeback in their 45-44 loss to Cal, the Longhorns special teams did it again. This time it was punter Michael Dickson who dropped the ball in a 27-27 tie with 42 seconds remaining, resulting in a punt of minus six yards, handing the Pokes the ball at the Texas 18-yard line and setting up the game-winning field goal. Just wow. That doesn’t even cover Charlie Strong’s 15-yard penalty with the ‘Horns leading 27-24 and 3:47 left in the game on OSU’s game-tying drive. \nLink: 5 Thoughts From Week 4: TCU’s D, Fournette, Bowl Chances For Auburn & Arkansas \n3) Is Oregon Done as an Elite Program? \nThis may be premature, as HC Mark Helfrich more than held down the fort in his first two season in Eugene but after getting thrashed by Utah 62-20, the Oregon Ducks have fallen out of the AP Top 25 for the first time since 2009 and I’m not sure they’ll be able to get up. They are certainly not going to compete for a playoff spot this season and I have to wonder if they ever will again, on a consistent basis that its. \nThis was their worst home loss since 1977 and most points allowed since 1985. Utah had the better QB play (Oregon QBs were 14 of 30)—when was the last time you said that about an Oregon opponent?—a significantly better defense and the Utes were even more creative than the Ducks with several trick plays and fakes. Without Chip Kelly …without Marcus Mariota …are the Ducks the same caliber program? I’m not saying it’s definitely over but it’s a legit question. \n4) Does Home Field Mean Nothing in the Pac-12? \nIn addition to the big wins by Utah at Oregon and UCLA at Arizona (with GameDay there!), Week 4 saw USC win at Arizona State 42-14, Cal win at Washington 30-24 and Stanford win at Oregon State 42-24 (Friday night). Only one of those games was close and the only Pac-12 team to win at home in Week 4 was lowly Colorado, 48-0 over Nicholls State. So I ask…does home field meaning nothing in the Pac-12? \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
