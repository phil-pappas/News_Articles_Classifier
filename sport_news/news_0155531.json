Both a homage to the masters and a celebration of the new generation of Cuban talent, the performance was transcendent, heartfelt and a whole lot of fun.\nRelated: Buena Vista Social Club: the legends look back\nThe intermittent mixture of sepia-toned black and white photos and video of the dearly departed like Ibrahim Ferrer projected on to an overhead screen, seemed to compete with the onstage action of the living. But soon the two fused into an inter-generational love in, with holograms from a pre-revolutionary past merging with the sounds of septuagenarian musicians stepping lively with younger artists – like promising singer Carlos Calunga – half their age. In an era when a black president is talking to Cubans and there is a Latin American pope, it seems entirely appropriate that pre-revolutionary Cuban music is being both fetishized and reinterpreted by millennial musicians.\nWhile this may truly be the adiós tour for some of the ageing figures, the performance showcased the considerable talents of the young Rolando Luna on piano early on with a moving version of Como Siento Yo. Musical director Jesús “Aguaje” Ramos impressed with a sultry trombone solo in Bodas de Oro, while Barbarito Torres lent his nimble stylings to a percussive El Rincón Caliente.\nThings heated up when Eliades Ochoa came on stage – black cowboy hat and all – for the beloved guajira El Carretero. A certain Cuban country twang infused both his vocals and his considerable guitar prowess. Reaching out to the restrained Canadian crowd he called them familia , and they warmed to him.\nRelated: Buena Vista Social Club to get sequel\nThe incomparable Omara Portuondo arrived on stage towards of the end of the show and wowed with a rousing version of Lágrimas Negras that finally got the crowd dancing in the aisles. Her interpretation of the bolero 20 anos by María Teresa Vera, accompanied with great sensitivity by young Luna, was easily the highlight of the evening and revealed the incredible range and colour of her still powerful voice. It’s hard to believe she once considered giving up singing entirely.\nThe 85-year-old diva enjoyed herself with a playful take on Quizás Quizás Quizás before the club’s “greatest hit” Chan Chan – played in sync with images of Compay Segundo in 1950s Havana – and El Cuarto de Tula closed the show.\nEncores came in the form of the 1930s bolero Dos Gardenias and the popular song Candela that saw the band go from descarga-jazz influenced jam sessions to tightly synchronized harmonies and choreography. While one hopes that it’s not really adiós and only hasta luego , do see the farewell tour before it too becomes sepia-toned nostalgia. You will have no regrets, only pure delight.\nBuena Vista Social Club are on tour until 4 November", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T11:39:54.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
