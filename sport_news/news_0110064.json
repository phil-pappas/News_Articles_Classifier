Micah Leavell was also on the court that day as the Central Bearcats played McCutcheon in the North Central Conference Tournament championship. \nWith no one within five feet of her Oct. 10, Wilhoite rose up for a kill and when she landed, she blew out her left knee. Just like that, Central's best all-around player tore her ACL. Done for the season. \n\"I just turned around and started crying and started praying because I knew with the way she was holding her leg and crying really hard, I knew it was an ACL,\" said Leavell, a senior right-side hitter. \"It was more sad than anything because she's like a little sister and I know she was hurting. \n\"We all have these dreams of winning state this year. And we still can, because we have the determination in our hearts. It was just pretty hard.\" \nAs Marshall and Leavell watched Wilhoite wobble out of The Fieldhouse on crutches after practice Monday, they tried to explain how the Bearcats — winners of 21 straight matches — can move on without Wilhoite when their sectional opener is just three days away. \n\"I think the first day it happened,\" Marshall said, \"everyone was just kind of depressed and no one was going to say they were really down, but I think we were. But now after talking with (Coach Wes Lyon) and Virginia and that little meeting we had, I think we're more… she would've been nice to have — obviously it's always good to have Virginia — but we all need to step up and do our part.\" Buy Photo \nCentral's Virgina Wilhoite hits for a point against Delta during their game at the Muncie Fieldhouse Tuesday evening.

As Lyon said, \"Let's face it, we were right there (with her).\" Without her, it's more of a tossup with Fort Wayne Concordia (27-4), which is also in the top 10 in 4A. \nThe cupboard, though, is far from bare without Wilhoite, who emerged as a sophomore to lead the Bearcats with 271 kills. Leavell, who switched from the middle mid-season, has 251 and 47 blocks. \n\"If she could just step out of this and say, 'Hop on my back, we're going to go,'\" Lyon said. \"… A right-side hitter like her, there's just not too many players like her.\" Buy Photo \nCentral's Amaya Smith prepares to serve against Wapahani on Monday at Wapahani High School.

Middle hitter E'Laisah Young, setter Lacee Adams and libero Kinkaid Padgett are also experienced, reliable players. \nThe Bearcats aren't denying it — there's a void that needs to be filled without Wilhoite. \n\"But it's a good pressure,\" said Marshall, who is second on the team in aces and digs and fourth in kills. \"It's not like an uncomfortable pressure, like, 'Oh God, I have to do this, oh no.' It's like, 'I'm about to get this kill.'\" \nContact sports features writer Ryan O'Gara at (765) 213-5829.
