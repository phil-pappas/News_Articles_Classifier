Addressing a rally at Rajasansi, party leader Sanjay Singh said: “The government has removed the Agriculture Director but took no action against the minister. He should be sacked and arrested immediately.” He said: “The insensitivity of the government can be gauged from the meagre amount of cheques given to farmers as relief.” The rally evinced huge response from locals, mostly youth, who thronged the venue on motorbikes and tractors. Addressing them, Sanjay Singh said: “We cannot arrange buses or food packets like other parties. You have come on your own and that is the reason why leaders of major parties are having sleepless nights.” Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann also accused the government of being insensitive towards the plight of farmers. He said party volunteers would remain present in grain markets after October 10 to create awareness among farmers facing trouble in selling their produce.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:02:51.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
