He was like, ‘Ohio State is nice, it’s a big name and everybody loves it, but I want to play for my home state and in front of my family.’ ” \nSo far, the younger James has had that opportunity just once, appearing in the season opener against Norfolk State. Two other true freshman cornerbacks, Blessuan Austin and Jarius Adams, have played more. \nBut Rutgers' depth is running dangerously thin following an offseason of four dismissals and a transfer, and now an injury to Austin. If Austin does not play, James will be one of just three scholarship cornerbacks available at 8 p.m. Saturday against Ohio State. \n“I’m preparing like I prepare every other week,” James said. “I’m just waiting for an opportunity. The coaches always make the choice for the right reasons. \n\"Jarius is playing, and we dorm together. We’re in the playbooks every night. When I see him go on the field I’m pretty proud. It definitely gives me confidence. I’m just waiting to get on the field as well.” \nIf the time is now, Paul James is confident in the youngest of his five brothers. \n“He fought with the older brothers and made himself tough, and we definitely see that,” Paul said. “We always tested him growing up: ‘Come play with us.’ He’s never backed down. I think, Ohio State walking in the door, he’ll be ready for it.” \nNext year, Rutgers' roster likely will have three players who turned down Ohio State. \nAll-Big Ten defensive tackle Darius Hamilton, who is out for the season but hopes to return as a redshirt senior, did so as a five-star recruit in 2012. Patrice Rene, a four-star commit in the 2016 recruiting class , followed in Ronnie James’ shoes. \n“It shows the value of this program that kids are starting to see,” said Paul, a former walk-on. “They will pick this program over a program like that. It shows we’re coming.” \nStaff Writer Ryan Dunleavy: rdunleavy@gannettnj.com 430 CONNECT 10 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1LOjC2Z TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:08:30.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
