Rosen completed 19 of 28 passes for 284 yards and two touchdowns, leading the Bruins to a 56-30 rout of the Wildcats. Through four games, though, junior running back Paul Perkins remains the centerpiece of the offense, having rushed for 514 yards (10th in the nation) and six touchdowns. Under the guidance of senior quarterback Mike Bercovici, Arizona State was expected to be among the Pac-12’s best offenses, but the Sun Devils rank 11th in the conference in scoring (25 points per game) and were held to two touchdowns in losses to Texas A&M and USC. The Sun Devils might have at least found their running game last week. Demario Richard rushed for season-highs of 131 yards and two touchdowns in a 42-14 loss to USC. EDGE: UCLA\nDEFENSE\nThe injuries keep mounting for UCLA’s defense. Inside linebacker Jayon Brown’s status for this game is uncertain after he left last week’s game at Arizona in the third quarter with back spasms. Brown practiced some this week, but Coach Jim Mora has not said if he’ll be able to play. Brown already was replacing all-conference talent Myles Jack, who suffered a season-ending torn meniscus the week prior. Despite the injuries, the Bruins’ patchwork defense made things tough for Arizona’s offense, holding the Wildcats to 30 points, well below the 54 they were averaging beforehand. UCLA did allow 353 rushing yards, though, the most it had allowed in 10 years. ASU features an aggressive defense that likes to blitz. Last season, the Sun Devils ranked fourth in the Pac-12 in sacks and third in forced turnovers. They already have nine sacks this season. EDGE: EVEN\nSPECIAL TEAMS\nUCLA kicker Ka’imi Fairbairn has put together a nice season. Fairbairn has put 23 kickoffs in the end zone, and his touchback percentage of 79 percent ranks third best in the country. He has made six of seven field-goal attempts, missing a 50-yard attempt. Matt Mengel has been reliable pinning punts inside the 20, but he is averaging just 39 yards per punt. Dangerous return man Ishmael Adams returned to UCLA’s lineup last week. Devin Fuller has also shown some explosiveness in that role. Meanwhile, ASU kicker Zane Gonzalez has missed three of his six field-goal attempts. Matt Haack has shown some leg on his punts, averaging 44 yards per attempt. EDGE: UCLA\nCOACHING\nTodd Graham faced a similar situation last season. After ASU was blown out at home at the hands of one L.A. school (UCLA) in Week 4, it traveled to Southern California to face the other (USC). On that October night, ASU upset the Trojans when Bercovici lofted a decisive Hail Mary touchdown pass to Jaelen Strong on the final play of the game. That was the start of a five-game winning streak and the Sun Devils finished with 10 wins for the second consecutive year. Can history repeat itself? Graham will look to refocus his team after a crushing loss at home to USC last week. Meanwhile, Mora has kept UCLA plodding along, even as the injuries mount. EDGE: EVEN\nINTANGIBLES\nThere are two factors that might put the Bruins on upset alert. For one, UCLA could be poised for a letdown game. After a big win in the Pac-12 opener a year ago at Arizona State, it lost at home to Utah. After beating USC in late November, putting it in line to play in the Pac-12 title game, UCLA lost to Stanford in the regular-season finale. So how will the Bruins respond following an emotional win at Arizona? On the flip side, Arizona State (2-2, 0-1) is in desperation mode. Its hopes for winning the South Division will be on life support if it loses this game. For that reason, the Sun Devils should come out swinging. EDGE: Arizona State\nMATCHUP TO WATCH\nArizona State’s front seven vs. Josh Rosen: There’s little question that ASU likes to bring pressure. According to ESPN Stats & Info, the Sun Devils have blitzed 66 percent of the time on dropbacks, the most in the country. They were leaders in the category last season, as well. Compare that to the average Power 5 program, which blitzes a mere 26 percent of the time, per ESPN. Expect the Sun Devils to go after UCLA’s freshman, who has at times struggled against pressure. BYU brought plenty of it and disguised its looks, and Rosen threw three INTs before halftime. If he reacts quickly and distributes the ball, the Bruins could make the Sun Devils pay. If ASU can rattle Rosen, the Bruins might be staring down their first loss of the season.\nPREDICTION: UCLA 38, Arizona State 34\nExpect points. Both teams feature dynamic offenses, and UCLA hit its stride last week at Arizona. ASU, which was ranked near the top of the conference in most offensive categories last season, should break out eventually. UCLA’s defense is banged up, while ASU’s has given up too many big plays – eight passes of more than 25 yards and seven runs of 20-plus. With the Bruins at home and the Sun Devils still not having found their footing, this should tilt toward the hosts.\nJOEY KAUFMAN\nContact the writer: mlev@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:24:59.490+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
