Joe Biden appears to be waiting in the wings on the chance that she will fail to get dominant traction very soon.\nThe first Democratic presidential debate today, featuring five candidates, may be a ho-hum affair for the great majority of people. Certainly it will lack the magnetic qualities of the first two Republican debates. But it could well provide a defining moment of Clinton’s campaign. And Biden’s, though he probably will not be on the stage. And let’s not forget the churning upswell of Bernie Sanders, who’ll be making, essentially, his national debut.\nDemocratic voters have certainly been entertained by the debate circus in the other party.\nClinton remains the odds-on favorite to secure the nomination. The big money, the ground game, the power people — it all adds up, despite the polls that show lingering strength for Sanders. If, somehow, she cannot finally shake the email-server bulldog snapping at her feet, then the Democratic reset option may well involve Biden.\nClinton just made another one of her transparently calculated stands on a controversial issue, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Although she had championed the trade agreement as President Barack Obama’s secretary of state, Clinton is now playing to the party’s labor-union base — and Bernie Sanders’ core — by voicing opposition to the newly crafted pact. Yet, as usual, she finessed the maneuver and left the door open for reversing her reversal by suggesting she hadn’t actually read the whole thing.\nBut what will debate watchers hope to see on Tuesday night?\nFor starters: solid, convincing analysis and program proposals on boosting jobs and the economy. There’ll be lots of talk about income inequality, social safety nets, the influence of Wall Street and big banks — and there likely won’t be much space between positions espoused by Clinton, Sanders and the others.\nBut voters will also want to hear how the candidates would handle the morass in the Middle East and the rising audacity of Vladimir Putin and the Russian power play over Syria.\nI spoke long distance the other day to a media class at Fontbonne College in St. Louis and fielded one young woman’s plea that the candidates solve her crushing student-loan situation.\nDebate watchers will also get their first real glimpse of three candidates who hardly register in the polls — former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, former Sen. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and former Senator and Navy Secretary James Webb of Virginia. Will any of them present a swashbuckling, Carly Fiorina moment?\nO’Malley has been hammering hard on immigration, voicing an accommodating position — not unlike that of his fellow candidates — and hoping to gain traction with Latino voters. Chafee presumably will explain just why he’s running and how his campaign theme of “prosperity through peace” would really work. Webb’s experience in the military and as a bestselling novelist might make him an intriguing case.\nIf you end up tuning in, see you around the water cooler thereafter.\nSteve Paul is the editorial page editor for The Kansas City Star.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-12T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:07:17.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
