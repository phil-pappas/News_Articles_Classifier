Gen. Abdullah al-Mehanna, as saying that the driver faced over $190,000 in fines after being caught.\nThe statement on Saturday did not identify the driver, but reminded drivers they have a month's grace period to change their license plates to Kuwaiti ones for foreign-bought cars.\nCountries throughout the Gulf use traffic cameras to enforce speed limits and traffic laws.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
