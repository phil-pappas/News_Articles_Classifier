Apparently she was abandoned by her mom, raised by humans with dogs, and now has an extremely cute identity crisis.\nAlso from the surprisingly large Animals With Identity Crises file, we have Pip the baby wallaby – let us pause while we nominate \"Pip the baby wallaby\" to the Cute Phrases Hall of Fame – who, after being abandoned by his mom, got adopted by humans and now thinks a shopping bag is his new mom's pouch. The photos are adorable.\nLess adorable: The McDonald's customer in New Mexico who flipped out – to the point where cops had to be called – when pickles were mistakenly included on his meal . You would think that someone with a palate that sensitive would be avoiding fast food entirely, but you would be wrong. (We know. Our resume includes a stint at McDonald's, and we were yelled at about this exact problem in New York in 1989. And yes, we're still ticked over it. Honestly, people. Just peel the darn thing off and eat your no-we-cannot-make-it-medium-rare hamburger.)\nAlso from the so-large-we-need-a-separate-server-for-it file of Humans Behaving Badly, we have the bride and groom who billed two guests $75.90 for failing to show , taking that execrable \" cover your plate \" nonsense to a whole new level of rudeness. Yes, failing to show is rude, but billing people? Sheesh. These are people we wouldn't trust to raise either Pip the baby wallaby or Pumpkin the raccoon.\nMoving right along, we have some poor soul who was shopping at a flea market, apparently unaware that the simplest things get scary in Florida, and discovered an 8-foot-long python nestled in a stack of clothes . Equally terrifying: the bulge in the snake indicating it had just eaten. We assume there was lots of screaming until the cops were called to remove the snake, but it's possible that Floridians are so used to this kind of thing that they're blasé about it. We, on the other hand, have a shiny new entry in our list of Reasons Why We Will Never Set Foot in Florida.\nAnd to end on a happy note, here are 109 cats in sweaters . Remarkably, few of them are visibly angry.\nThe week in weird will not appear next week. We're not sure what we'll do on vacation, but we plan to avoid Florida.\nHappy weekend! Take care at flea markets!\n-- Mary Mooney\nmmooney@oregonian.com\n503-412-7020; @ MaryKnitsPDX", "external_links": ["http://pix11.com/2015/09/30/woman-gets-bill-for-missed-meal-after-not-attending-wedding/", "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3261123/The-raccoon-thinks-s-dog-Wild-animal-adopted-injured-baby-cub-nursed-health-family-two-pups-thinks-s-house-pet-too.html", "http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/homestead/article36774372.html", "http://www.buzzfeed.com/expresident/109-cats-in-sweaters#.er7QaD7o9", "https://twitter.com/maryKnitsPDX", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/amazing-pictures-show-cute-baby-6580737", "https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-gift-etiquette-cover-plate-rule", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mcdonalds-customer-has-fit-when-order-comes-with-pickles_5609c0c7e4b0dd850308db25?utm_hp_ref=weird-news"], "published": "2015-10-10T20:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:19:07.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
