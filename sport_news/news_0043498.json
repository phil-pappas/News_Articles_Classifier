Kids dying for shoes and the only face this dude makes is I don't care. The time will change!\n— I AM PEACE STAR (@StarburyMarbury) October 5, 2015 \n\nJordan wasn’t Marbury’s only target. The Brooklyn native threw some shade at King James as well, when a Twitter follower pointed out the Cavaliers star’s shoes also sell for well over $200.\n“He’s a follower not even giving that any energy,” tweeted Marbury, who initially launched his Starbury brand in 2006 as a partnership with retailer Steve & Barry’s. With a retail price of just $15, they sold well, but Steve & Barry’s eventually went out of business. Now Marbury is back in business, and they’ll be produced by the same factories that make Jordans.\nHome boy your paying 200 for Jordan's and they make them for 5 dollars. The shoes are made in China in the same places.
