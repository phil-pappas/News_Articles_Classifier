The junior finished the day with 42 yards on the ground on ten carries. \nQuarterback Dakota Prukop was 15-of-21 through the air, throwing for 226 yards and three touchdowns. The junior also picked up 31 yards rushing on just four carries. \nSenior wide receiver Mitch Griebel had a team-high five receptions for 62 yards, while sophomore Justin Paige led the way with 92 receiving yards on just two catches, including a 41-yard touchdown reception in the first quarter. \nAfter its worst performance of the season, the Montana State defense played exceptionally well, allowing a season-low seven points. The Bobcats forced four Buccaneer turnovers, equaling the turnover total through the first six games of the season. \nSpecial teams was also a critical factor in the game. Sophomore running back Nick LaSane blocked a punt that set up Montana State's second touchdown, and sophomore wide receiver Jayshawn Gates had a 97-yard kickoff return touchdown late in the fourth quarter that helped produce the final margin of victory. \nThe Bobcats improve to 4-3 on the season, and they return to Big Sky Conference play next week as they hit the road to play North Dakota in Grand Forks. \nCopyright 2015 by KECI , KCFW , KTVM .
