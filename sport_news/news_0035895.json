With that effort, Casse will point Tepin to the $2-million Mile, one of the more popular races on the season-ending showcase. \n“She was fired up, but she was impressive,” said Casse, who acknowledged after the race that the Mile — and a race date against male runners — would be next up for his prized mare. \nAlso on target for the two-day extravaganza in the heart of North American thoroughbred country are a potential threesome in the Juvenile Fillies Turf, including Airoforce, who captured the $250,000 Bourbon Stakes while Stablemate Siding Spring finished third. \nAlso a likely entrant for that Juvenile Fillies Turf is Conquest Daddyo, a winner of the Summer Stakes at Woodbine in her previous start. \nCasse is also hoping that two-year-old colt Conquest Big E will qualify for the Breeders Cup Juvenile. \n“We felt like coming in we were bringing some live horses,” Casse told the Daily Racing Form. “But you can never predict this kind of success.” \nHE’S FOR THE BIRDS? \nIt’s been a while since he triumphed at the track that made him famous — or anywhere for that matter — but 2013 Canadian horse of the year Up With the Birds heads a group of 20 nominees for the Pattison Canadian International, the final big thoroughbred stakes race of the year at Woodbine. \nThe 78th edition of the historic 1 1/2-mile race, which will be run over the E.P. Taylor Turf Course on Oct. 18, will represent an opportunity for the Sam Son Farm homebred to renew the form he showed here as a three-year-old. \nThe five-year-old, who was trained at Woodbine by Malcolm Pierce but is now under the care of U.S.-based Graham Motion, has a pair of third-place finishes from four starts this year. \n“He’s a lovely horse and Malcolm obviously did a great job with him,” Motion said. “He’s run a couple of really good races for us and my frustration is that I haven’t been able to get him to the winner’s circle yet.” \nAlso on target for the International is Second Step, a Group 1 winner in Germany for trainer Luca Cumani and Sheikhzayedroad, a winner in England, Dubai and Canada, where he captured the Grade 1 Northern Dancer Stakes last year. \nThe Dancer, named after the great Canadian runner and stallion, is a $500,000 co-feature on the International card, one of the highlights of the Woodbine season. \nTAKE A SHOT \nNothing like a free bet, with a shot at $1 million, no matter how high the odds are stacked against. \nThe Woodbine Entertainment Group is offering a free-to-enter shot at a big payday for the Pattison Canadian International card. The Woodbine Million Dollar Megapick requires bettors to predict the exact order of finish in both the E.P. Taylor Stakes and the International. \nIf no one predicts the correct first-to-last finish order, a consolation prize of $10,000 will be shared among those who get closed to the exact order. \nPUCKS AND PONIES \nIt was expected to be a big Thursday night in Buffalo for Sabres general manager Tim Murray, but it’s not the only competition he’s interested in these days. \nA long-time standardbred owner, Murray has had some good success over the years including this year with two-year-old stakes-winning trotter Deep Impact. Murry said he pays attention to pedigree, scouting racing prospects as diligently as he would hockey players. \n“It’s scouting and it’s potential and that’s what we do in hockey,” Murray told Trotinsider. “I love scouting young hockey players and you’re never looking at a finished product. It’s the same (in racing): It’s the dream of seeing a world champion two dams town and trying to duplicate that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:47:36.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
