But Rose's swelling didn't dissipate as quickly as envisioned, so his clearance for activity this week could be merely for running and not practicing.\nThe Bulls have yet to rule him out for the Oct. 27 regular-season opener against the Cavaliers. How well Rose's conditioning responds and he adjusts to wearing a mask will be factors, as will how his vision responds once he begins activity.\n\"He still has some blurred vision in that eye. It’s still very swollen,\" coach Fred Hoiberg said. \"But he’s definitely making progress from when I saw him a week ago.\"\nHoiberg said he planned to review film with Rose following the morning shootaround in preparation for Monday's exhibition against the Pelicans.\n\"He still isn’t able to do anything as far as court work. Hopefully, he’ll get clearance in the next couple days to at least get a sweat going and getting a little bit of running,\" Hoiberg said. \"It will help to get him out here running. Different guys learn different ways. I think it’s very important once we get him back to show him and be able to run (the offense) first-hand to get the timing right. But he’s able to pick it up quick. It’s a lot of the same things we were doing, just adding on different wrinkles and different options. From Derrick’s standpoint, the biggest thing is just getting out of the house. He was getting such cabin fever. The opportunity for him to get back in here is very important.\"\nRose could be seen joking with teammates and coaches in the practice facility. He didn't address reporters because the team had a post-shootaround session with officials, who make the rounds during the preseason to go over points of emphasis with teams.\nHoiberg said the Bulls would start Kirk Hinrich, Jimmy Butler, Tony Snell, Nikola Mirotic and Pau Gasol versus the Pelicans. Joakim Noah will miss his second straight game with a minor knee contusion.\n\"He still has a little bit of stiffness in that knee. It’s nothing serious,\" Hoiberg said. \"He went through shootaround but we’re going to take a cautious approach with him and make sure that knee is 100 percent before we throw him back out there.\"\nThat could be Wednesday versus the Pistons at home. If not then, both Noah and Taj Gibson, who has yet to play this preseason, are likely to play next Monday in Charlotte against the Hornets.\nHoiberg said Gasol's minutes could increase slightly on Monday. He sat out the second half when he made his exhibition debut on Saturday against the Timberwolves.\nHoiberg also keeps insisting Doug McDermott, who has outplayed Snell to this point, will draw a start at some point in the preseason. The coach said he likes Snell's defensive ability to ease some pressure on Butler at the start of games as well as McDermott's scoring punch off the bench.\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Bulls", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561be16d/turbine/ct-derrick-rose-eye-injury-20151012"], "published": "2015-10-12T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:24:47.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
