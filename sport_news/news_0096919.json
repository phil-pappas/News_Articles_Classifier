(Photo by Greg Macafee) Greg MacAfee Reporter COTTONWOOD- When he heard some of his friends and family needed help with their kids, Robert Gonzales decided it was time to get back into something that he had experienced with his son when he was younger. His son was getting into trouble at school, he couldn't get him interested in sports, and disciplining him wasn't working either.Gonzales got him involved in Kickboxing and Muay Thai, and his life changed. He started traveling all over the country with his son to compete. His son's grades came up, he started getting healthier and his life changed for the better. HDH Kickboxing started with three kids, a couple of pads and a mat in the grass at Riverfront Park. After a brief stint in an area donated to them by Jones Ford, HDH Kickboxing has found their new home. The walls are painted red and black, the colors of HDH, four punching bags hang from the ceiling, and a speed bag rattles as a student punches it in the corner. The scenery may have changed, but the goal is still the same for Gonzales and the rest of the club as they look to the future. \"It's about the kids, and it always will be about the kids,\" Gonzales said as his kids got warmed up for another session. With his son, Jesse Duran, warming up a class of about 14 students, Gonzales explained how he has seen everything come together from day one. The original three are still with Gonzales and that group of kids has built to 22-24 kids on daily basis with the ages ranging from 6-16. Gonzales was forced to shut down for a week as his students were slipping on the floor and mats had to be installed, but HDH is back at it on a daily basis.The new gym located at 2593 S Union Dr. in Cottonwood is a place the students of HDH can call home for now, but as more students roll in, Gonzales believes he may have to move to a bigger gym in the future. \"I don't think I'll be here long because it's growing that quickly,\" Gonzales said. \"I might have to cap it here soon just because we have so many kids.\" With so many new kids Gonzales has started all the way at the beginning, teaching the basics of kickboxing. With not much room to have a number of different kids on different levels, everyone is learning the basics all over again. With two different classes a night, 6-12 year olds start at 5 and end at 630. The second class is for members 13 and up and runs from 630-8. Both classes run Monday through Friday.\"It's like a 90-minute workout of kickboxing, we keep the gym at about 85-90 degrees and it just cleanses the body. We're just pouring sweat in there,\" Gonzales said. For the class every student must sign a waiver, and their first day is free. To register for HDH it costs $50, this gets you your first and last week of classes, along with hand wraps, a mouthpiece and an HDH shirt. Every week after the first week is $10. Gonzales has already seen success from some of his students, as one has brought his grades up and continues to step up in the gym, sparring with kids no matter the size. Gonzales said his life has changed since starting up the gym. \"I'm starting to build something, and I don't want to stop anytime soon,\" Gonzales said. The goal will always be the same for Gonzales and the rest of his gym, but expect to hear something in the future from HDH Kickboxing as he plans on bringing something new to the Verde Valley. -- Follow Greg Macafee on Twitter @greg_macafee and Instagram @VerdeValleyNews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:52:14.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
