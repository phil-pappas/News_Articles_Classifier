Sulsberger Memorial Stadium. \nHost Zanesville piled up 28 first-quarter points and rolled to a 69-0 Senior Night win against River View in the East Central Ohio League. \nAccording to joeitel.com, which unofficially figures high school football computer rankings in Ohio, Zanesville clinched a playoff game in Division III, Region 9. \nThe Blue Devils (8-1, 3-1 ECOL) ran for 263 yards behind seniors Leondre Crosby and Derek Grandstaff in a game they held the Black Bears to minus-18 yards in the first half and minus-28 yards total. \nZanesville also got three special teams scores — punt returns from Alessio Amato and Benjamin Kaufman and a kickoff return for a score by Kaufman to open the second half. Zanesville led 49-0 at halftime. \nZanesville, now 8-1 on Senior Night games under coach Chad Grandstaff, now faces a road game finale at Marietta, where they need a win and a Dover upset of rival New Philadelphia to share the Scarlet Division title. The Tornadoes edged Marietta, 28-24, on Friday after trailing 24-21 in the fourth quarter. \nChad Grandstaff downplayed the league title possibilities. \n\"It's more about being able to go 9-1, which has been done 10 or 12 times in schools history and this could be the fourth one I have had in nine years,\" Chad Grandstaff said. \"Wrapping up a home playoff game is our focus at this point. Marietta is a good football team. We have to go down there and play well, and we don't typically.\" \nThat 13-10 overtime road setback to the Quakers lingered well into its Week 8 win at Cambridge, a game when the running game didn't live up to normal standard, but Grandstaff put up one of his best performances of the season. \nEvery element worked in unison against a Black Bears team that went three-and-out on each of its first half possessions, including being pushed back 17 yards in three plays after returning a fumble to the Zanesville 2-yard line. \n\"Last week the week of practice our guys just wasn't themselves and it showed when we played Cambridge. We didn't play well at all,\" Grandstaff said. \"This week we looked like we were back to our old selves and had our swagger back. They looked like the Blue Devils, and obviously tonight they came out and played really well.\" \nCrosby ran only six times in the game, but he piled up 117 yards, including a tackle-breaking 54-yard touchdown through traffic in the second quarter. It came after Derek Grandstaff took an option keeper 64 yards for a score, splitting a pair of defenders in the process. \nEarlier in the second, Amato followed Kaufman's 52-yard punt return for a score down the sideline with a 75-yarder in which he split two defenders, broke a tackle and outran the Black Bears to the end zone. \nFor good measure, Derek Grandstaff was 4-of-4 passing, including a 54-yard bomb to Ja-Quan Mathews that set up the game's second score — Deaunte Goins' 2-yard run up the middle that made it 14-0. Crosby had a 40-yard run earlier in the quarter to set up his 6-yard score to open the game. \nCoupled with the harrowing defensive effort, the Black Bears (1-8, 1-3) were overwhelmed from the start. \n\"We knew River View was struggling this year, but our goal was to come out and play at a high level and execute offensively and defensively,\" Chad Grandstaff said. \"I was pleased with the way those guys did that. They came out and played at that high level and our execution was really good.\" \nCaden Croft was 2-of-12 passing for minus-5 yards and managed just minus-7 yards rushing, as the Black Bears had 20 carries for minus-23 yards on the ground. \nsblackburn@zanesvilletimesrecorder.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:02:10.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
