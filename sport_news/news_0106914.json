Seth Russell struggles. Baylor QB Seth Russell made himself a Heisman Trophy contender last week after 540 all-purpose yards and six touchdowns against West Virginia. Russell actually attempted the most passes of his career (37) but completed only 16 for 197 yards. Russell's long-ball was woefully off all day, and it did not all have to do with the weather. Russell is lucky other players stepped up around him or the Bears could have been in trouble.\n2. Defensive success. The final numbers won't do them justice, but the defense played an outstanding game against an Iowa State offense that had the ball for long stretches of time. The Bears allowed 388 yards of offense, but the Cyclones had the ball for nearly 35 minutes on the day. Baylor held ISU to 4.6 yards per play and forced four turnovers: two picks and two fumble recoveries. The offense failed to capitalize and made the defense's final numbers look worse. That said, Andrew Billings' effect was certainly missed in the middle against the run.\n3. Sloppy play. Hurricane Patricia is starting to come through the Gulf of Mexico and the weather has been terrible across the state. With heavy rain and cool temperatures in Waco, the game became sloppy. The two teams combined for six turnovers, including three interceptions and three fumbles. Receivers also dropped several passes as the ball seemed to slip through their hands on several occasions. With such a rhythm-based offense, Baylor was heavily affected by the weather.\n4. Rushing success. Baylor's running game was outstanding against Iowa State, especially RB Shock Linwood and Russell. Linwood posted 171 yards and a score on 27 carries in one of his most productive games of the season. His quick feet and incredible balance extended several Baylor drives. Russell also added 64 rushing yards and a touchdown. Baylor relied on their ground game with the weather being as bad as it was.\n5. Complacency kills. Baylor was up 35-0 in the second quarter and it seemed like the Bears would simply dominate the Cyclones, as they have several opponents as of late. But Baylor allowed 21 unanswered points and failed to score in the third quarter for the first time since its 49-17 loss to Oklahoma State in 2014. Baylor eventually scored 10 additional points in the fourth quarter, but there are certainly concerns about whether the Bears will be able to put together four quarters this season.\nOn Twitter:\n @ShehanJeyarajah", "external_links": ["http://dallasnews.stats.com/cfb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=201510240079&home=79&vis=19", "https://twitter.com/ShehanJeyarajah"], "published": "2015-10-24T22:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:10:02.662+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
