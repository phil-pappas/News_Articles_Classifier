This time, though, the Patriots didn’t embarrass the Colts, as it was the Colts who did it to themselves.\nTrailing 27-21 with 1:14 remaining in the third quarter and facing fourth-and-3 at their own 37-yard line, the Colts used an illegal punt formation to throw off the Pats, but it backfired in epic fashion. Wide receiver Griff Whalen snapped the ball to safety Colt Anderson, who were isolated together in the middle of the field while the remainder of the formation was banked to the right sideline, but Brandon Bolden stuffed Anderson for a 1-yard loss. Six plays later, Tom Brady scrambled and hit LeGarrette Blount for an 11-yard touchdown that pushed the Pats’ lead to 34-21 in the fourth quarter.\nAndrew Luck diced up the Patriots on the game’s opening series, which was a 13-play, 89-yard drive that spanned 7 minutes, 44 seconds. Luck completed 8-of-9 passes for 62 yards on the drive, including two third-down completions for 13 yards and a 5-yard touchdown lob to Donte Moncrief on fourth down. Moncrief beat cornerback Malcolm Butler on the fade route to give the Colts a 7-0 lead, and the stadium operators fired off their first round of fireworks, confetti and glitter.\nThe Patriots’ pent-up anger after nine months of Deflategate-induced drama, which was launched by the Colts after the AFC Championship game, was ever present on the ensuing drive. Brady and Edelman connected for a 12-yard touchdown to tie the score, 7-7, and the shifty receiver dashed to the back of the end zone to unleash a fastball toward the Colts’ horseshoe logo.\nThe Patriots took a 10-7 lead in the second quarter when Stephen Gostkowski made a 40-yard field goal, and they had slowed down Luck’s offense to seize control of the game by forcing a couple of punts after the scoring drive.\nThat momentum quickly evaporated, however, when Edelman lost control of an easy pass on a crossing route toward the right sideline. Edelman corralled the pass and then juggled it right into safety Mike Adams’ hands for Brady’s first interception of the season. Adams walked into the end zone for a 14-yard, pick-six that put the Colts ahead, 14-10, with 11:30 remaining in the second quarter.\nThe Patriots caught a break right after that when the Colts appeared to recover a surprise onside kick, but the officiating crew, with the help of a replay review, awarded possession to the Pats. Blount closed the quick drive by storming through the right side of the line for a 38-yard touchdown that gave the Pats a 17-14 advantage.\nBut Luck was persistent and continued to soar down the field with another timely response. The Colts’ ensuing drive culminated on third down when Luck scrambled away from the pass rush, and Hilton spun behind Ryan to get free for a 3-yard touchdown connection that put the Colts up, 21-17, with 2:38 to play in the first half.\nEdelman made another significant contribution on the following drive when he took a quick hand-off on a fourth-and-1, creatively spun away from two defenders in the backfield and gained 2 yards up the middle. But the Patriots had to settle for Gostkowski’s 35-yard field goal, which trimmed the deficit to 21-20, after tight end Scott Chandler’s touchdown was negated due to an offensive pass interference penalty.\nThe Patriots grabbed the lead for good on the first possession of the second half. Rob Gronkowski was shut out in the first half but caught a pass over the middle, split two defenders and scored an easy 25-yard touchdown to give the Pats a 27-21 advantage.\nThe defense held from there, keeping the Colts off the scoreboard for their first six second-half possessions until Luck and Whalen hooked up for an 18-yard touchdown with under two minutes to play.\nGronkowski recovered the ensuing onside kick and the Pats killed the clock from there, moving to 5-0, and setting themselves up for a big AFC East showdown with the Jets next Sunday in Foxboro.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:24:16.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
