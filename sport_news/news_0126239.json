Ikhlaq was beaten to death on September 28 for after rumours spread that he had eaten beef. The report also termed the comments made by BJP politicians disturbing and aimed at making “capital out of such outrages”. A three-member team, which visited Bisada village, in its report said: “The team feels that a crowd of large numbers appearing within minutes of an announcement from temple’s loudspeaker and at a time when most villagers claimed they were asleep seems to point to some premeditated planning. The facts point strongly that the whole episode was the result of planning in which a sacred place like temple was used for exhorting people of one community to attack a hapless family.” The Commission said it would be “an understatement” to call the killing an accident — a clear reference to a statement by Union Minister Mahesh Sharma and some other BJP leaders. It added that what was more disturbing was that “responsible” people went to the site of the incident to make irresponsible statements. “All political establishments need to counsel their cadres and sympathisers to desist from making irresponsible statements and making capital out of such outrages,” it said. The commission spoke to the district administration and family of the victim. Quoting district officials, NCM said two more attempts to “incite” people by spreading rumours of cow slaughter were foiled by police. The commission also claimed that Iqlakh’s family had denied they had had problems with other villagers before the incident. “They claimed that the attack was sudden and vicious and the men were particularly and brutally targeted and women were also assaulted and injured. They were, however, all praise for the help provided by the administration,” the report said. Hindus expressed regret over the shameful incident and promised to provide security to Muslim families, but Iqlakh’s brothers found it hard to believe in the backdrop of the murder, the panel’s report said, adding that the family now lived in fear. “The NCM chairman said providing security to Muslim families in the village was at this time paramount and all efforts have to be made to expedite police investigation so that the guilty are brought to book quickly. He also emphasised that all assistance to the victim’s family has to be provided, whether it is legal, material or emotional,” the report said. NCM also called for reviving intelligence gathering to alert authorities of “such conspiracies” to prevent incidents like the Dadri lynching. “It has to be revived with utmost sincerity if we are really interested in restoring communal amity. It is an issue on which both the central and state authorities have to work in tandem without blaming each other,” it said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:07:33.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
