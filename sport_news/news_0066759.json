(AP Photo/Michael Perez) \nPHILADELPHIA (AP) — Two wins in eight days helped the Philadelphia Eagles jump from last to first in the NFC East. \nIt’s that kind of a division this season. \nThe Eagles (3-3) beat the New York Giants 27-7 in a sloppy game Monday night for their third win in four games after a 0-2 start. The Giants (3-3) had won three in a row after they also started 0-2. \nMeanwhile, Dallas (2-3) is winless in three games since losing Tony Romo in Week 2 against the Eagles. The Cowboys also lost Dez Bryant in their opener. The Redskins (2-4) have lost two straight since a comeback win over Philadelphia. \nIt should be a tight race the rest of the way. \n“I don’t think of things globally,” coach Chip Kelly said Tuesday. “Each week is its own individual season. I’m looking at Carolina. I couldn’t even tell you who is winning the AFC until we play those teams.” \nThe Eagles routed the Giants despite another poor performance by Sam Bradford, who threw three interceptions. He had a pair of red-zone picks in a 39-17 win over New Orleans last week. \nBradford already has nine interceptions and only nine touchdown passes. He’s on pace for 24 of each, which would be career highs in both categories. \n“If I knew, I would stop throwing them,” Bradford said about the picks. “It is something that I never really had a problem with in my career. I have never thrown a lot of interceptions, so this is kind of new to me. But we’re going to get it fixed. I’m going to get it fixed. And hopefully we are going to eliminate that from our offense.” \nA strong defense and improved running game has been the winning formula for Philadelphia. The defense intercepted Eli Manning twice, including a pick-6 by Nolan Carroll. \nIt held the Giants to only 247 total yards, 55 in the second half. Last week, the defense forced Drew Brees into three turnovers and held the Saints to 10 points before a meaningless score on the final play. \nOverall, defensive coordinator Bill Davis’ unit has come a long way. They’re ranked eighth against the run and 19th against the pass. \n“We’re really focused on turnovers and points allowed,” Davis said. “That’s what we talk about often and that’s what we know the best defenses do. Right now, we’re getting turnovers at a high rate and the points are down.” \nWhile Bradford has been inconsistent, DeMarco Murray has sparked the ground attack. Murray has 192 yards rushing in the past two games after gaining just 47 in the first four weeks. The key has been the offensive line opening holes for him. \n“I think we’re all on the same page and we’ll continue to get better,” Murray said. \nThe Eagles have a short week to prepare for a road game against the undefeated Panthers (5-0) next Sunday night. \nCam Newton led Carolina to a comeback win at Seattle and should be looking to get even for a rough game in Philadelphia last season. Newton was sacked nine times in a 45-21 loss in Week 10. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n___ \nFollow Rob Maaddi on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AP_RobMaaddi Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:57:29.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
