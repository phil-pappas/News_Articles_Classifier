If the Wildcats and Rebels should both prevail, they will face off in Wilmington in Tuesday's semis. \nIt was just over a month ago that Leland & Gray defeated Twin Valley 2-1 on Hayford Field, ending a streak of 39 victories in a row by the Wildcats and 28-straight at home. But let's not get caught \"looking ahead\" here. \nBuddy Hayford, who has a state high school soccer record 376 coaching victories, got two goals and two assists from senior star Justin Hicks in an easy playdown victory over Oxbow. They two-time defending champs will now be going up against the likes of Jyi Larivee and Noah Swainbank, who accounted for Enosburg's burials in a 2-1 decision over Green Mountain on Tuesday. \nSenior midfielder Owen McDonald, whose grandmother refers to as \"the Blur\" because of his blazing speed, will likely get plenty of attention from Thetford's back line. The No. 13 Panthers are wearing the glass slipper at this point, after using goals from Connor Brown, Dylan Thorburn and Cordell Benjamin to surprise fourth-seeded Williamstown 3-0 in their playoff opener. Advertisement \nJust like the past Survivor winners, it seems like any team that is able to score a goal against the Bellows Falls field hockey team during the Division 3 Tournament should be given a million bucks. \nNo. 8 Montpelier (0-11-3) will have its chance today at 3:45 p.m, when playing in Westminster versus the top-seeded Terriers (10-2-2) in a quarterfinal. \nBellows Falls outscored its opposition by a combined 21-5 this season, playing against strictly Division 1 and 2 foes. Goalies Emma Lober and Brigid Hodsden teamed up for 11 shutouts. \nWinless Montpelier has been blanked in eight consecutive games, with the team's last goal coming in a 2-1 loss to Springfield on Sept. 23. And now the Solons will be asked to penetrate a defensive wall that consists of Emily Stoddard, Murphy Hicks and Paxton Santorelli. The confident Brattleboro Union High School varsity football team probably doesn't really care where today's quarterfinal against CVU (4-4) is played — Cambodia, Australia, Africa, the North Pole. As it is, kickoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. on Natowich Field. \nChad Pacheco's \"Win The Day\" tribe earned a home playoff game by coming from behind to beat rival MAU a week ago, behind a couple of TD strikes and a sneak to paydirt by quarterback Tony Martinez. The Colonels (4-4) also like to feed junior tailback Cheick Diakite, who ran for five scores in both Saint Johnsbury and South Burlington this season. \nBrattleboro's defensive backfield, which had four interceptions versus Colchester, should be tested regularly tonight. CVU signal-caller Andrew Bortnick threw the ball 19 times for 197 yards in a recent loss to MAU, with Trevor Kingston and Sam Mikell each finishing with three grabs and a score. \nIn the other Division 1 quarterfinal showdowns on the gridiron this evening, No. 1 Rutland is hosting No. 8 MAU, No. 2 Middlebury will welcome No. 7 Saint Johnsbury, and No. 6 Colchester will visit No. 3 Hartford.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:57:19.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
