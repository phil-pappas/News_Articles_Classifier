They can win a pillow fight or a rock fight.\nFor most of the first five games this season, they embarked on the March of the Midgets, beating up woebegone teams like the Jacksonville Jaguars and Indianapolis Colts, woe-is-me teams like the depleted Pittsburgh Steelers and Dallas Cowboys, and one woefully dysfunctional Buffalo Bills team led by (who else?) Rex Ryan.\nYesterday was different.\nYesterday the Patriots found themselves in a heavyweight wrestling match with the stingiest defense in the NFL, one ably supported by a running game that prides itself on loosening your molars and beating down your defense. There was plenty of need for dental work in Foxboro after three hours of grimacing and grappling with the New York Jets, but still nothing to worry about. Pillow fight or rock fight, the Patriots have the edge.\nThey have Tom Brady at quarterback and they have a belief that, if they just keep pulling on the rope, eventually plays will be made. Yesterday many were not, because the Jets defense put pressure on the Pats offense like it had not felt all season — resulting in at least nine dropped passes, no running game (when Brady is your leading rusher, that is the definition of no running game) and uncharacteristic struggles on third down on both sides of the ball. For much of the game, the Jets defense was like a vice.\nBut when the game was to be decided, it was decided not by the rib-busting Jets defense or their powerful inside rushing game. It was decided by Brady, who went 14-for-17 for 150 yards and two touchdown passes in the game’s final two drives — and a collective faith that, regardless of how things are going and how much pressure they are feeling, things will usually work out if everybody tends to his business and sticks to the plan.\nDoubt does not creep in, because too many times in the past it has been proven to them that there is no reason to doubt. Panic does not begin to rise, because faith in things seen and unseen trumps it — faith that the road they have chosen will lead to victory if they refuse to deviate from it.\nThe Jets know all about this because they have experienced it time and time again since the launching of the Border Wars back when Bill Parcells abandoned Foxboro for a return to Jersey.\nDuring those years, the Jets have had their moments from time to time, and made life difficult for Brady and his teammates most of the time. Yet, when it’s over, they usually find themselves in the position they did yesterday — shaking their heads.\n“I’m angry because I feel like we had them right where we wanted them,” Jets guard Willie Colon said after the battle had ended in a 30-23 Patriots victory that lifted them to a 6-0 record. “I felt like we were the better team out there, but obviously we were not.\n“They beat us because we didn’t execute. We were out there competing and everyone was out there fighting and scrapping, but we came up short in the second half. They beat us in the X’s and O’s. They executed.”\nThat doesn’t mean the Patriots made every play, because they didn’t. It doesn’t mean there was much to pick between the two teams except at quarterback, where it counts most, because there was not.\nBut what it means is that the margin for error when it comes to beating even a Patriot team without two starting offensive linemen, its best back and one of its best pass rushers is slim. If you do not execute nearly flawlessly and always wisely, they get you.\nThe most glaring example of this came on the play that became the winning touchdown. The Jets ran a blitz off the left side, two rushers splitting tight end Rob Gronkowski. It was a blitz they ran successfully in the first half, but one that left Gronkowski wide open if he didn’t stay in to block. The mistake was showing it to Brady again.\n“I was in pass protection a lot, a lot of blitz zero,” Gronkowski explained. “I just saw they were coming with my guy that had me man (to man) and just leaked out there in the flat. Tom saw it and it was just a good play. Good, smart football. It was a great play.”\nIt was also a wide-open 15-yard pass so easy it was as if Brady was flipping the ball to his son Jack in the backyard. He knew what was coming before it happened, and so did Gronkowski. Mr. X and Mr. O left the Jets hollering “Oh, no.”\nIt was the kind of day that drains you, a physical and mental battle where the one drains the other over time. The Jets won the first three quarters of that battle, 17-16, but lost the final quarter, 14-6 and hence the game. The team that wears down its opponents physically got worn out mentally.\nMaybe the Jets won the fight, judging by the number of Patriot bodies that went flying through the air and the number of passes that were dropped on the ground, but the war? The war went to the Patriots.\n“The second half was where the tempo may have gotten to us a little bit,” Jets cornerback Antonio Cromartie admitted. “The communication part wasn’t always there.”\nIn the end, a Jets defense that had been giving up 15 points a game allowed twice as many, while a Patriots offense that had been scoring 36.6 a game still put up 30. In the kind of rock fight that occurred at Gillette Stadium yesterday, no one would perform as well as they had in previous weeks.\nThe question was which one would slip the farthest? In the end, it wasn’t the Patriots.\n“We’re a very mentally tough team,” defensive end Rob Ninkovich said. “We go into the game understanding you’ve got to play four quarters and you’ve got to stick to the plan. I think just believing in ourselves and knowing that if we continue to fight, at the end of the game we’re going to come out victorious as long as we continue to play hard and believe in each other. We really don’t focus on the other team. We focus on ourselves.”\nThat’s how you win pillow fights in the NFL. And rock fights, too.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Borges%3A+Patriots+win+rock+fight+with+Jets"], "published": "2015-10-26T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T10:20:48.881+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
