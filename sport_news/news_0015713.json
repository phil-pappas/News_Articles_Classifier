Everyone knows about Head of the Charles. It’s going to be one big party on the bank.”\nWhipple, a coxswain who won gold in 2012 in London and 2008 in Beijing — along with a silver medal in Athens in 2004 — has competed “off and on” at Head of the Charles since 2001. She will not be competing this year, but said the range of athletes who will is part of what makes the event unique.\n“It’s very competitive,” she said. “They have the top colleges and a lot of competitive older categories. There’s a lot of old Olympians, but rowing takes practice so a lot of club rowers love to train and beat the Olympians. But then the Olympians come and they say ‘man, I have got to get to work.”\nMass. state troopers set to compete in Head of the Charles Photo Gallery: Mass. State Police practice for practice for the Head of the Charles Regatta The 34-year-old California native highlighted the many booths and exhibits spectators can check out. She will be at the Liberty Mutual Medal Pavillon today from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., next to the USOC booth as part of the “Road to Rio” tour — getting people excited for next year’s summer games in Rio do Janeiro, Brazil.\nThis weekend, the forecast will be a bit chillier than Rio, with temps hovering in the low 50s. But sunny skies are expected for both days of competition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:32:03.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
