Overall, it was a good team win.” \nGary Holmes led the way with 103 yards on just 10 carries, scoring two touchdowns in the first half. Holmes did not play much in the second half but still managed his first 100-yard game of the season and second of his career. \nMark Cato finished the night 8-for-19 for 187 yards, the biggest play coming late in the second quarter when he found tight end Kenny Johnston on a short pass play, and Johnston turned it into a 71-yard touchdown. That play gave the Panthers a 24-0 lead, which held up at halftime. \nFor Johnston, it was his sixth touchdown of the season, tops on the team. \nBut once again the story of the game was the Panthers’ defense, which held Fort Valley State to 168 yards of total offense. And in the first half it was all defense as they forced two fumbles and four three-and-out series. In the first quarter, the Wildcats had managed just four total yards of offense and had zero yards rushing at the half. \nFort Valley State broke up the shutout with 4:18 left in the game when Drelon Freeman found Deion Perry for a 27-yard pass play. \nIt was also a historic night for the Panthers as freshman Antwuan Haynes became the first player to return a punt return for a touchdown in school history when he took a kick 76 yards for a touchdown in the fourth quarter. \n“He’s been a dynamic player and I can’t wait to see what his career ends up to be,” Englehart said. “He is getting a lot of playing time as a freshman and having some productive games, and he is going to be good for us for many years.” \nHaynes finished with 138 all-purpose yards on the evening, leading the team. \nThe Panthers got a scare on the final play of the game as Landon Galloway took a hit and remained down for an extended period of time. But he did get up and Englehart thinks he will be OK. 41 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.flatoday.com/1ROVG0b TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:43:31.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
