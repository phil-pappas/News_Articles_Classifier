He had another spot-on day, completing 17 of 24 for 321 yards with the long touchdown pass to Brandon Tate during a scramble.\nIt was another rough day all around for Kansas City (1-3). Alex Smith was sacked five times, the Chiefs settled for Cairo Santos' club-record seven field goals, and the defense couldn't keep up with another one of the NFL's top passers.\n\nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
