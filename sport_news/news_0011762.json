They could be better, possibly 5-1, if they scored points at Missouri (9-6 loss) or against Navy (28-18 loss at home).More important, signs of the dogged efforts to build a winning culture have been apparent on the heels of a 2-10 season. Although still inconsistent, UConn has had better offensive line play and offensive execution.But the program has come a long way in a year. With six games to go, the Huskies have a shot at bowl eligibility for the first time since the 2011 season. The difficult nonleague schedule, among the top 25 toughest in the nation, should serve them well. The Courant's Desmond Conner grades their first six games in his midseason report card. (Desmond Conner) Desmond Conner Contact Reporter For Diaco, team, a long time coming. \nSTORRS — When Bob Diaco walked into the press room after the Huskies clubbed Central Florida, he had already hit the shower. And for good reason, since minutes before he had a shower of another kind. \n\"Yeah, yeah, got hit with the Powerade,\" Diaco said. \"They could have chosen water. There were some sticky issues there, but it's all good.\" \nSenior defensive end Kenton Adeyemi had orchestrated the move that resulted in UConn's second-year coach getting doused over the head with blue Powerade following a 40-13 win Saturday over Central Florida at Bright House Networks Stadium. \nThe Huskies hadn't won the national championship. They hadn't even won their division. In fact they evened their overall record to 3-3 and 1-1 in the American, which is noteworthy considering where they were last season and that they had won the Diaco-manufactured \"Conflict\" trophy that garnered so much attention over the summer — intentionally. \nBut a dousing after Game 6 against a team that came in a 0-5? \n\"I'm a senior and that was my first trophy game,\" Adeyemi of Wethersfield said. \"I feel like we're a young conference, but a lot of teams in our conference have been playing football for a long time and so why not start up a trophy game? I know they have them in all the other major conferences. Why not start one in our conference; we're just as good as all the other teams. I felt like it was our trophy. He deserved it. We worked so hard over the summer, during the week, put a lot into it. It really was a culmination of a lot of things.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:28:06.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
