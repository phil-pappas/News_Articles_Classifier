He moved into a tie for sixth on the NFL's all-time interception list with Ed Reed.The Broncos' No. 1 ranked defense had another dominant performance, holding the Raiders to 288 yards and one touchdown. They picked off two passes, forced a fumble and sacked Carr four times, giving them 22 sacks for the season.The Raiders built a 7-3 halftime lead, but Denver cut it to 7-6 on Brandon McManus' 20-yard field goal with 11:25 left in the third quarter.

Cutler leads Bears over Chiefs \nQuarterback Jay Cutler threw two touchdown passes in the game's final three minutes to lead the Chicago Bears to a come-from-behind 18-17 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday afternoon.The Bears were down 17-3 at halftime, and trailed 17-6 going into the fourth quarter before Cutler was able to avoid pressure from the Chiefs defense and took the offense down the field for a 22-yard touchdown to wide receiver Marquess Wilson. He then threw the winning score on a 7-yard play to running back Matt Forte with seconds left.The Chiefs attempted a 66-yard field goal on the game's final play, but the attempt by kicker Cairo Santos was well short, barely making it into the end zone. It capped a disturbing afternoon for the now 1-4 Chiefs as they may have lost the engine of their offense. Pro Bowl running back Jamaal Charles left the game six minutes into the third quarter with what appeared to be a serious injury to his right knee.Charles was unable to walk off the field without help as he could not put any pressure on his right leg as linebacker Justin Houston and trainer Rick Burkholder provided support. There was no word on the severity of the injury immediately after the game from the Chiefs. Charles missed 14 games of the 2011 season when he suffered a torn ACL in his left knee playing against the Lions in Detroit.Health was also a factor with the Bears, as they had 16 players on the injury report before the game, and did not have their two best wide receivers and their No. 1 center available. Early in the third quarter, Chicago lost inside linebacker Shea McClellin with a left knee injury.The Chiefs scored touchdowns on offense and defense in the first half, along with a field goal. They reached the end zone the first time on the work of their defense. Defensive linemen Jay Howard and Allen Bailey overwhelmed the interior of the Chicago offensive line, sacking Cutler two yards deep in the end zone. Bailey knocked the ball out of the quarterback's hands and Chiefs linebacker Ramik Wilson fell on the fumble in the end zone for a Chiefs touchdown.Late in the first quarter, the Bears got on the scoreboard with a 44-yard field goal from Robbie Gould that made it 7-3. After that possession, the Chicago offense did not progress past its own 28-yard line for the rest of the first half.Kansas City added an offensive touchdown on a 19-yard pass play from quarterback Alex Smith to wide receiver De'Anthony Thomas to cap a 7-play, 54-yard drive. Santos added a 35-yard field goal to set a 17-3 score at intermission.The Chiefs had the first possession of the second half and drove down the field, largely on the legs of Charles. But that's when disaster struck on a first-and-goal run from the Chicago 9-yard line. Charles was stopped for no gain by outside linebacker Sam Acho, and on the play suffered a right knee injury.Losing Charles seemed to take the wind out of the Chiefs, as they were unable to reach the end zone and a 27-yard field goal try by Santos was blocked by Chicago linebacker Pernell McPhee. The Bears went down the field and eventually picked up a Gould field goal of 30 yards and the score was 17-6 at the end of the third quarter.Cutler kept Bears hopes alive through the fourth quarter and connected with Wilson in the end zone for a 22-yard touchdown. Wilson beat Chiefs cornerback Marcus Peters on the score that capped an 11-play, 88-yard drive. Chicago went for two points, but Cutler's throw to wide receiver Marc Mariani came up short of the end zone, setting the score at 17-12.Kansas City's offense was unable to hold onto the ball, and the Bears moved back down the field with help from a pass interference penalty against Peters. Cutler fumbled the snap and had a Kansas City pass rusher grabbing at his feet, but he found Forte in the end zone for the winner.NOTES: Sunday was just the second home game in five weeks for the Chiefs. ... Bears K Robbie Gould became the leading scorer in franchise history for Chicago, picking up six points against the Chiefs, giving him 1,118 points and passing K Kevin Butler at 1,116 points. Gould grabbed the record with a 30-yard field goal late in the third quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:11:04.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
