Ashley Henson said. But Marsha Lynch, 45, told investigators a handgun fell and discharged when it hit the ground shortly after 5 p.m. Saturday at the family’s home in the Yorkville community, near the Polk County line.\nLynch was taken to Floyd Medical Center in Rome, where she underwent surgery to treat a gunshot wound to her leg, Henson said.\nAn 8-year-old girl died following what authorities believe was an accidental shooting inside a home on Fairview Drive in Dallas. (Credit: Channel 2 Action News) Paramedics hoped to fly Sharia Lynch, 8, to an Atlanta hospital by helicopter, but her condition deteriorated. She died before arriving at Paulding WellStar Hospital, Henson said.\nNo information was released on where the gun was located in the home or how it fell, Henson said in an emailed statement. Two other children and one adult were in the house at the time of the shooting, but were not injured.\n“At this point, detectives are still investigating this case and will speak to the victim and witnesses in more detail once the funeral has taken place,” Henson said.\nFuneral arrangements were pending Monday morning.\n— Please return to AJC.com for updates.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/18/76/7b/image1sdfff.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T20:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:38:34.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
