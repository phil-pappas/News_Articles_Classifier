(AP) - Two inmates at a Louisville, Kentucky, jail could have used a course in knot-tying when authorities say they plotted an escape using bed sheets.\nOfficials say the men escaped to the roof of a minimum-security building Monday night and used a rope made of bed sheets to climb down about four floors. Metro Corrections Director Mark Bolton says 29-year-old Matthew Johnson was climbing down when a knot on the sheets came loose, dropping him about 20 feet. He then fled.\nPolice learned of the escape around 9 p.m., when a hospital worker saw Johnson climbing down.\nThe second inmate, 37-year-old Christopher Cornelius, didn't risk the climb and was found on the roof.\nBolton says Johnson was found hiding in a car during a traffic stop early Tuesday morning. He injured his ankle and back and remained hospitalized Tuesday.\nBoth men were in jail on drug charges.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T03:05:30.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
