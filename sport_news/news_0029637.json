The Sooners handed the Wildcats their worst shutout loss of the Bill Snyder era, winning 55-0. By Emilio Rivera The Capital-Journal \nMANHATTAN — Kansas State coach Bill Snyder’s defense came into Saturday’s game hoping to do what Texas did last week and hold the Oklahoma offense to under 300 yards. \nUnfortunately for the Wildcats, they did allow 300 yards ... by halftime. \nOklahoma’s offense was dangerous coming into the game, with the Sooners holding the best completion percentage in the Big 12. Bob Stoops also boasts the eighth-best offense in the NCAA, with the fifth-best points-per-game mark in the country. \nK-State’s secondary struggled early, allowing Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield to complete 8 of 10 passes for 102 yards in the first quarter. The Sooners’ second touchdown came after a Joe Hubener pass was intercepted and returned to the K-State 16-yard line, and only it took them two-plays to get into the end zone. \nMayfield didn’t slow down in the second quarter, going 10 for 11 with three touchdowns. Oklahoma had built an insurmountable 35-point lead heading into halftime. \n“They got people into positions to throw the ball to, which means that we didn’t cover well. It’s really that simple,” Snyder said. “The defensive schemes are designed to defend against whatever it is they put out there. Obviously we didn’t. We just have to play the schemes better. \n“Oklahoma did a nice job. They knew what they were doing. We showed some weakness and they took advantage of it. I can appreciate that on their part.” \nThe former Texas Tech quarterback Mayfield surgically attacked the K-State secondary, throwing a healthy mix of short and long passes to get his offense running smoothly. He finished the game with a 222.9 quarterback rating, going 20 for 27 with 282 yards and five touchdowns through the air. \nAnd it wasn’t just the pass K-State struggled against, with the Oklahoma run game taking over late. The Sooners gained 232 yards on the ground. \nThe Wildcat secondary could not provide backup for their front-line defenders in the run game, allowing multiple long runs downfield. Four of the Sooners’ six ball carriers managed to find an open lane for at least 10 yards. \nThe defense allowed a total of 568 yards. \nDEFENSE SUFFERS MORE INJURIES — Senior cornerback Morgan Burns returned to action for the Wildcats after missing last week’s game with an injury. But K-State was forced to play freshman Duke Shelley opposite to Burns because of an injury senior cornerback Danzel McDaniel suffered last week against TCU. \nTo make matters worse, sophomore linebacker Elijah Lee was hurt in the middle of the second quarter after he was blindsided by an Oklahoma receiver. And late, safety Kaleb Prewett left the game with a presumed concussion. \nAnd finally, early in the fourth quarter, Shelley had to be helped off of the field. \nSophomore Sean Newlan stepped up for the Wildcats, recording a team- and career-high 14 tackles. \nDEFENSIVE LINE STEPS UP EARLY — The Wildcats’ defensive line made Mayfield panic early in the game, getting immediate pressure on the Sooners’ quarterback. Sophomore lineman and Topeka native Will Geary had two sacks on five tackles in the first half, finishing the day with seven tackles. \n“Well, making plays when you’re down by 30 points, you really don’t get too excited,” Geary said. “I was asking myself the same question, ‘What went wrong?’ It was just that it got out of hand so quick. Our offense couldn’t put any points up, we couldn’t stop them, and Oklahoma just came out and gave it to us.” \nThe interior of the defensive line forced Mayfield to have to escape the pocket on multiple occasions. But their presence didn’t last long, when the Oklahoma offense began to continually beat the pressure and find the seams downfield early in the second quarter. \nHISTORIC STREAKS SNAPPED — By holding K-State without a touchdown, Oklahoma ended the 11th-longest scoring streak in the country. The 234 straight games dated back to 1996 when Colorado beat the K-State 12-0, and the 158-game home scoring streak dated back to 1991 when the Buffaloes topped the Wildcats 10-0. \nAdditionally, K-State had it’s streak of scoring two touchdowns stopped at 56 games. \nOKLAHOMA TRAVEL PLANS — Oklahoma’s charter plane into Manhattan was delayed nine hours at the Oklahoma City airport, resulting in the Sooners not landing in Kansas until after midnight.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:40:06.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
