Hambley Athletic Complex. \nNathan Anderson’s blocked punt that he returned six yards for a score gave Cumberland a 14-7 advantage at the half. Chaplin scored from a yard out and Michael Green’s 88-yard catch-and-run put the Bulldogs ahead, 28-7, with 10:41 left in the third quarter. \nPikeville (2-4) answered the Bulldogs three times in the second half, with Elijah Bell going 39 yards for a score, but Snyder’s 26-yard scamper up the middle on fourth down made it 34-14 CU after a missed PAT. \nJamar Kirksey’s 35-yard scoring run and Quan Weaver’s three-yard TD carry pulled the Bears within 34-27 in the first minute of the final period. Snyder’s interception on the ensuing drive, just his third INT of the year, set-up Pikeville at midfield, but Cayman Russell tackled Weaver on fourth down at the CU21. \nCumberland (2-3) then put together its longest scoring drive of the year, taking more than seven-and-a-half minutes off the clock. Chaplin was the workhorse on the possession, carrying six times for 35 yards. Snyder hit Green over the middle for 13 yards on 3rd-and-11 and Snyder rushed 13 yards for the UPike 8. The drive stalled, but Matthew Alter booted a 24-yard field goal to extend the lead to 37-27. \nThe Bears answered quickly though, with Elijah Bell catching a 60-yard pass on the first play. Three plays later Weaver rushed around right end for the score, but again Pikeville missed the extra point, keeping the Bulldog lead at 37-33. \nNathan Jernigan recovered the onside kick but Cumberland was unable to get a first down to run out of the clock, with Jack Hopkins knocking a third down pass out of the hands of Brandon Mallory. The home team took over at its own 11 with 1:38 remaining and got a first down on the first play of the drive.Weaver rushed for 22 yards on third down but the Bears were called for holding and Jernigan tackled UPike quarterback Hasani Warren scrambling on fourth down to seal the victory. \nSnyder finished 13-of-24 for 198 yards and the two scores and rushed 11 times for 76 yards. Green caught five passes for 162 yards and one TD.Warren completed 19-of-33 passes for 259 yards while Weaver rushed 24 times for 75 yards and two scores. \nJernigan forced a fumble on the opening possession of the game and Tyler Burr, playing in his first game of the season, scooped it up and returned it seven yards to the UPike 16. Six plays later Snyder hit Mallory for a two-yard TD pass and a quick 7-0 Bulldog edge. \nThe Bears answered with a 10-play, 81-yard drive that included a 10-yard scramble by Warren and a 24-yard completion to Jamon Langford. Two plays later Warren weaved his way 17 yards up the middle for a touchdown, knotting the game at seven with 8:51 left in the opening period. \nCumberland special teams provided the only other points of the half, with Alex Campagne forcing UPike punter Damir Karapandzic to change his approach and Anderson blocking his second punt of the year. Anderson picked up the bouncing ball and carried it the final six yards for the score and a 14-7 CU advantage. \nCumberland returns home for the first time in five weeks next Saturday, facing Kentucky Christian at 1:30 p.m. at Nokes-Lasater Field. \nCourtesy Cumberland University Media Relations Department Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T10:51:54.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
