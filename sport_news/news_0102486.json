Two years ago the Gators used a block punt to spark a 12-8 win in a game played at Prairie Basse. \nLast year at Donald Gardner, it wasn’t close, as Beau Chene defeated the Tigers 23-6. \nOpelousas defeated Beau Chene 29-0 in 2012 for the Tigers’ last win in the rivalry. Since 2009 Opelousas is 2-4 against the Gators. \nNorth Central Claims First Win \nThe North Central Hurricanes achieved their first win of the season Friday night with a 40-26 Class 5-1A victory at False River. \nIt was the first district victory for North Central since the 2010 season when the Hurricanes defeated Sacred Heart. \nNorth Central’s victory also produced the most points the Hurricanes (1-6, 1-1) have scored this season. Entering the game with False River 2-5, 0-2), North Central was averaging less than a touchdown per game. \nThe Hurricanes have a tough contest ahead this Friday night as they again travel to Pointe Coupee Parish. This time North Central meets Catholic Pointe-Coupee, which is tied for the league lead with Basile. Both of those teams are 2-0 in district games. \nEunice and Church Point \nPerhaps the area’s most attractive matchup is scheduled for this Friday night in Church Point where the host Bears and Eunice – the two leaders in District 5-3A – meet in a crucial league game. \nBoth are 6-1 and 2-0 in league contests. \nEach team also has a penchant for scoring points. \nChurch Point has been held to two touchdowns only once in seven games. Otherwise the Bears in their six other games have scored an average of 40 points. \nEunice has also displayed somewhat of a scoring matchine. \nIn the Bobcats’ seven games they have averaged 35.8 points. \nEunice has outscored their two district opponents 90-25. For Church Point it’s been much the same, as the Bears have outscored 5-3A teams 87-18. \nArea Week 8 Schedule \nSacred Heart (2-5, 1-3) at West St. Mary (1-6, 1-3) \nFriday’s Games \nBeau Chene (4-3, 0-2) at Opelousas (0-7, 0-2) \nEunice (6-1, 2-0) at Church Point (6-1, 2-0) \nVille Platte (4-3, 1-1) at Northwest (5-2, 1-1) \nPine Prairie (3-4, 0-2) at Port Barre (4-3, 0-2) \nOpelousas Catholic (5-2, 3-1) at Catholic-NI (5-2, 4-0) \nFalse River (1-6, 0-2) at Basile (6-1, 2-0) \nSt. Edmund (2-5, 1-1) at Westminster (4-3, 0-2) \nNorth Central (1-6, 1-1) at Catholic PC (4-3, 2-0) Read or Share this story: http://www.dailyworld.com/story/sports/high-school/2015/10/18/hurricanes-claim-win-false-river/74190460/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:33:34.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
