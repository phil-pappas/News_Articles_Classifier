Texas Tech's 30 points were the least amount the team has scored all season. \nFive different Texas Tech offensive playmakers recorded over 50 yards receiving. Zach Austin led the Red Raiders with 80 yards receiving, Jakeem Grant had 76 yards, Devin Lauderdale had 50, Cameron Batson, 58, and Reginald Davis, 57 yards and a score. \nTexas Tech continued its streak of perfection, as the Red Raiders are 9-0 inside Memorial Stadium, a record dating to 1966. \nKansas (0-6, 0-3) is riding a nine-game losing streak and is 0-6 for the first time since 1988. Before this season, Kansas had only started 0-6 three times in program history, in 1954 and 1988. Head coach David Beaty is still waiting for his first win. \nFreshman quarterback Ryan Willis was 35 of 50 for a career-high 330 yards passing in his second start for the Jayhawks. Willis turned the ball over three times, throwing two picks and dropped a fumble. Running back De'Andre Mann gained 107 yards on 15 carries. \nKansas had its share of bloopers, most of those coming on special teams. \nMatthew Wyman missed an extra point attempt and two field goals, a 52-yard attempt and a 34-yard attempt, and Nick Bartolotta shanked a 22-yard field goal wide right. \nBut Kansas wasn't going out without a fight. Kansas had back-to-back touchdowns in the fourth quarter to put them down by 3. \nWith less than five minutes to go, Willis was backed up in his own end zone, which would have resulted in a safety, but he fumbled. Two Texas Tech defenders wrestled for the ball, but the ball rolled to Mann, who ran out of the end zone for a 4-yard gain. \nBut the momentum quickly shifted. On the next play, Willis threw a pick-six and Kansas' comeback hopes were dashed. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:03:01.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
