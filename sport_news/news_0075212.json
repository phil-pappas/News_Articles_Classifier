They found smoke and flames rising out of the building, said Portland Fire & Rescue spokesman Ron Rouse.\nFirefighters pulled two men from the apartment unit where the fire began, but medics were unable to save either man, Rouse said. One died Friday morning; the other died in the hospital Friday evening. Fire officials declined to identify the men.\nInvestigators determined that fallen smoking material caused bedding to catch fire, Rouse said. The one apartment, part of a larger three-building complex, was 40 percent destroyed, he said.\nSome of the complex's residents have live there for 20 years.\nTom Holiday, who lives next door to the burned-out apartment with his wife, Tamara, and cat, Mongo, said he was in bed when he first heard what sounded like firecrackers. He also smelled smoke.\nHoliday said he and his wife have lived in their apartment for about six years but rarely saw the next-door neighbors. He said they were elderly and stayed inside much of the time. They were assisted by in-home caregivers, Holiday said.\n-- Betsy Hammond\nbetsyhammond@oregonian.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:22:21.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
