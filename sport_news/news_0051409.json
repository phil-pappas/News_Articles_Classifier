I did not expect (Kornfeil) to be on the podium in Silverstone recently and we are happy with the team’s performance this season,” he said. \nRazlan said SIC would still assist Zulfahmi in deciding his career in motorsport. \n“Zulfahmi is an experienced rider and has competed in Moto3, Asia Talent Cup and FIM CEV Repsol International Championship,” he said. \nMeanwhile, Adam who saw action in the Asia Talent Cup and FIM CEV Repsol International Championship this year was delighted with his selection for the MotoGP next season. \n“This is a major breakthrough for my career and I must thank SIC for giving me the opportunity. Though I am replacing Zulfahmi, he (Zulfahmi) will continue to guide in the Moto3 race next season. \n“From young Zulfahmi was my idol. I started racing since the age of seven by competing in the Motocross until 12,” said the rider from Batu Pahat. — Bernama", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T13:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:22:41.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
