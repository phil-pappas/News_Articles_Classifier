(AP) - New York's lieutenant governor is leading a state delegation to Puerto Rico to help the U.S. territory as it struggles with a fiscal crisis.\nNew York Health Commissioner Howard Zucker and Secretary of State Cesar Perales joined Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul for the visit Monday.\nThe trip comes after Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo (KWOH'-moh) traveled to the island last month to offer New York's assistance as it deals with billions of dollars in public debt, much of it related its Medicaid and Medicare programs.\nCuomo says the challenges facing Puerto Rico's public health system are similar to those New York dealt with in the past and the state is \"proud\" to help.\nThe visit is expected to last through Wednesday.\nThis story has been corrected to show Puerto Rico isn't a state.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:48:23.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
