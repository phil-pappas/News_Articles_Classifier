(Photo: Ronald Martinez / Getty Images) \nDetroit — The Tigers season went on life support in Tampa, Fla., on July 29. That’s when then-general manager Dave Dombrowski decided the team would sell off its top free agents-to-be for prospects.\nThat’s when it became clear the goal had changed from trying to win a fifth straight Central Division title to reconnoitering and replenishing for a run in 2016 and beyond.\nTwo days later, David Price, Yoenis Cespedes and Joakim Soria were gone.\nTruth be told, though, the heartbeat of this team had been erratic and faltering since April.\nDETROIT NEWS\nChris McCosky's final Tigers grades\nTo wit:\nAfter the 11-2 start, the Tigers went 33-42 until the All-Star break.\nDetroit went 4-8 after the break, including losing three in a row in Tampa, where front-office personnel had convened to determine whether to buy or sell at the trade deadline. The three straight losses convinced Dombrowski it was time to sell.\nMiguel Cabrera missed six weeks from early July to early August — 35 games — with a strained calf. The Tigers were 15-20 before his injury, 15-20 in the games he missed and 14-21 the first 35 games after he returned.\nYou get the picture. This team, for a host of reasons, never gained traction.\nMany will point to that awful loss to the Twins at Target Field on July 10 as the symbolic night the season died. Hard to dispute it.\nPrice and Anibal Sanchez had beaten the Twins the two previous games, and Justin Verlander, after several rough starts, showed the first real signs of being himself. Home runs by Cespedes, Victor Martinez and J.D. Martinez had the Tigers up 6-1 going into the ninth. They were three outs away from being 45-41, with two more games against the Twins before the All-Star break.\nIt looked, at last, like they were making their move.\nDidn’t happen. Bruce Rondon and Soria imploded, and Brian Dozier’s three-run blast capped a seven-run ninth, sending both teams in opposite directions.\n“Today does not affect tomorrow,” manager Brad Ausmus said that night.\nHe was wrong.\nStarting pitchers Alfredo Simon and Shane Greene got rocked the next two games, and the Tigers never threatened to make another run.\nInjuries started slide \nThe autopsy will show the 2015 season died from multiple wounds, some self-inflicted, sustained steadily for six months.\nAnd it started with injuries.\nStart in the last week of spring training. Justin Verlander in his penultimate spring start, strained his triceps muscle. He was a year removed from core muscle surgery, had a full offseason training regimen and was looking like the elite pitcher he was before surgery.\nJustin Verlander and James McCann   (Photo: Robin Buckson, Detroit News) \nThen he had to go on the disabled list for the first time in his career. He didn’t return until June 13. And it took him seven starts to chip the rust and return to form. By then, the Tigers were in full flounder.\nRondon, a year removed from Tommy John surgery, would follow Verlander onto the disabled list, with biceps tendinitis. He came back at the end of June but was never a consistent contributor. Performance issues aside, his attitude degenerated to the point the team sent him home with two weeks left in the season.\nDesignated hitter Victor Martinez had surgery to repair his left meniscus Feb. 10. He rushed his recovery to start the season on time, but that proved to be a mistake. The knee, and later his quadriceps, hampered him all year. He went from a career year in 2014 (32 homers, 103 RBIs, .335) to a career-worst year (11 homers, 64 RBIs, .245).\nThe Tigers went to spring training believing they had a Murderer’s Row in the middle of their lineup with Cabrera, Victor Martinez, Cespedes and J.D. Martinez. That never materialized. The four never were healthy and productive at the same time.\nOther injuries followed.\nAnibal Sanchez, two years removed from winning the ERA title, had a horrendous year — 4.99 ERA, career-worst 29 homers allowed. Come to find out in August, his right rotator cuff was strained.\nCatcher Alex Avila (knee), right-hander Greene (arterial blockage in his shoulder), shortstop Jose Iglesias (finger) and rookie left-hander Daniel Norris (oblique) were all lost for a significant length of time.\nThe Tigers also had their share of underperforming veterans. Joba Chamberlain and Tom Gorzelanny were signed to one-year deals to help stabilize the bullpen. Both wound up designated for assignment, though Gorzelanny worked his way back.\nThe Tigers signed right-handed pitcher Alfredo Simon, who was coming off an All-Star season with the Reds, to a $5.5 million contract to be the No. 4 starter. His inconsistencies this season led Ausmus to dub him Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.\nWith the injuries and inconsistent production, the Tigers never got hot. They never could put together a stretch of games where they pitched and hit well at the same time. It was one or the other, or neither, all season.\nYou want Jekyll and Hyde? The Tigers led the majors with a .271 team batting average. Yet, they were limited to two runs or fewer 60 times. Their 679 runs scored ranked 10th in the American League.\nThey hit into a league-high 150 double plays. They had 51 runners caught stealing, 27 picked off, 51 thrown out on the bases, 25 at home.\nThose types of self-inflicted wounds cause a team to bleed out over the course of 162 games.\nPitching poured runs \nThe primary cause of death for the Tigers, though, was a congenital lack of pitching.\nGoing into the final weekend of the season, Tigers pitchers had allowed the most runs (797), earned runs (740) and home runs (193) in the American League. Also, opponents’ .270 batting average and 1.38 WHIP were the highest in the league.\nThe starting pitching? Dreadful. Sixteen times a Tigers starter failed to get out of the fourth inning, the most in baseball. The Tigers starters had the highest ERA (4.84), WHIP (1.34), opponents’ average (.268), plus had allowed the most runs (537), earned runs (496) and homers (136) in the AL.\nThe relief pitching? Not much better. They were second to the A’s in runs (260) and earned runs (244) allowed. Opponents hit .272 against the bullpen, highest in the league. Only two teams had fewer saves (35).\nBy the end of the season, the Tigers rotation featured three lefties who spent most of the season at Triple A in the Blue Jays system — rookies Matt Boyd and Norris, and 39-year-old Randy Wolf.\nAfter Soria left, the Tigers shuttled Alex Wilson, Rondon and finally Neftali Feliz in and out of the closer role.\n“It’s been true in baseball for 100 years,” Ausmus said. “Pitching and defense wins championships.”\nAnd a lack of pitching kills seasons.\nThe bright spots \nSo, are there any parts that can be salvaged from this cadaver? Plenty, as it turns out.\nRight fielder J.D. Martinez, for one. He answered those who said he’d be a one-hit wonder by hitting 38 home runs and knocking in 101 runs (with three games left). He became the first Tigers outfielder to knock in 100 since Magglio Ordonez in 2008.\nNick Castellanos   (Photo: Robin Buckson, Detroit News) \nVerlander, who posted a 2.02 ERA over his last 10 starts, showed he can still be the ace of the staff — which, in terms of retooling the roster for next season, may be the most significant byproduct of this season.\nThird baseman Nick Castellanos showed marked improvement defensively, enough to where the Tigers don’t need to shop for a third baseman this offseason. He also showed some mental toughness, fighting through a horrendous early slump and bettering his home run and RBI totals from his rookie season.\nJames McCann emerged not only as the team’s starting catcher, but also as one of the leaders. He hadn’t made an error in 111 games and had thrown out 40 percent of would-be base stealers.\nWilson, Blaine Hardy, Drew VerHagen and Kyle Ryan established themselves as capable bullpen arms.\nNorris, the main get-back for the Tigers in the Price deal, is a dynamic talent. If there is to be a pitching renaissance next season, he will need to play a huge part in it.\nAnthony Gose still has some hurdles to clear (hitting left-handed pitching, being wiser on the bases, getting better reads on the ball in the outfield), but showed he has the tools to not only be the everyday center fielder, but also a capable leadoff hitter.\nAnd, through all the disappointment and tumult, Ian Kinsler showed up and battled every day — even in September when all was long lost. He was hitting .299 with three games left, with 185 hits and his usual stellar glove work at second base.
