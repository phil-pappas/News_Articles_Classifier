Four to six inches of rain is expected to be dumped on parts of South Carolina on Saturday and Sunday.\n“At this time, everything is scheduled as planned and we intend to continue on that path unless authorities advise us otherwise,” Clemson University said in a statement Thursday.\nThe school said it will continue to monitor weather conditions as the weekend nears and that it has been in contact with the National Weather Service and the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nNo. 6 Notre Dame (4-0) is set to meet No. 12 Clemson (3-0) at 7 p.m. Saturday at Memorial Stadium.\nIrish quarterback DeShone Kizer said Wednesday he wasn’t too worried about the potential weather affecting his play.\n“Some of my best games in high school came in the rain,” Kizer said. “It's something that I haven't experienced lately, but we'll prepare for that using wet balls in our practice and understanding that the wind is going to come into play and things like that.”\nA source told the Post and Courier on Thursday that there has been no discussion of moving the game to Sunday.\n National Weather Service", "external_links": ["http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20151001/PC20/151009954", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560d6ae1/turbine/ct-notre-dame-clemson-hurrican-joaquin20151001"], "published": "2015-10-01T20:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:12:02.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
