The Washington Department of Transportation believes they’ve got the answers that will prevent any more issues with the 65-year-old tunnel.\nOn Sunday evening around 5:30, the tunnel’s sprinklers rained down on cars, prompting an hour long closure of Highway 99 in downtown Seattle. It happened once in May, which led to a three car crash and injuries to a woman. In June, the sprinklers malfunctioned twice in two days.\nThe previous issues were blamed on failing mercury switches. The malfunction on Sunday is blamed on a failed regulator.\n“It's hard to keep these systems going,” said Dave McCormick, WSDOT's assistant regional administrator. “But we've identified a spare part, and it's on its way.”\nThe Battery Street Tunnel was supposed to be decommissioned and closed off in December with the completion of the new Bertha Highway 99 tunnel project. But that project is more than two years behind , so the Battery Street Tunnel will remain open.\nKIRO 7 asked WSDOT if drivers should expect more sprinkler malfunctions.\n“No,” said McCormick. “I'm pretty sure we've got this taken care of.”\nWSDOT brought in a consultant familiar with old tunnel systems, and he's making a series of recommendations now being implemented.\n“Once we get through implementing his set of recommendations, I'm confident the system will operate correctly for the rest of its life here over the next few years,” said McCormick.\nThe total cost of repairs and modifications is about $15,000, not including labor, and comes out of the general maintenance budget. There’s no set timeline, but it should take a couple months.\nWant to talk about the news of the day?
