Amari Cooper was shut out in the second half, and Latavius Murray made two big mistakes. \nA little road success had a bitter aftertaste for the Oakland Raiders. \nCharles Woodson’s interception set up Sebastian Janikowski’s go-ahead field goal with 2:05 left, but Oakland was unable to stop Jay Cutler and the Chicago Bears on a 12-play drive to Robbie Gould’s winning 49-yard field goal with two seconds remaining in a 22-20 victory. \nIt was a return to normal for the Raiders (2-2) after they stopped an 11-game road slide with a 27-20 win at Cleveland last Sunday. They were held to 243 yards on offence after they rolled to 469 yards in the victory against the Browns. \n“It’s a fight every week,” Woodson said. “Last week was a great win, to go on the road and get a victory in Cleveland. But the name of the game is consistency.” \nCooper had 134 yards receiving against the Browns, and Murray rushed for a career-high 139 yards. But they struggled against the Bears (1-3), who got their first win under coach John Fox. \nCooper was double-teamed for much of the day and finished with four receptions for 49 yards — all in the first half. Murray juggled a second-quarter pass from Carr right into the arms of Bears linebacker Pernell McPhee, who returned his first career interception 13 yards to the Oakland 15, setting up the first of Gould’s three field goals. \nMurray also dropped a pitch for a costly fumble in the fourth and finished with just 49 yards on 16 carries. \n“I think it starts with turnovers,” said Murray, who was benched toward the end of the game. “I was the root of two of those. It’s hard to win with that so I think that’s where it starts.” \nThe Raiders still had a chance for their third straight victory after Woodson’s 62nd career interception with about 7 minutes left. Consecutive passes from Carr to Michael Crabtree moved the ball to the Oakland 47, and Roy Helu Jr. then broke off a 12-yard run for another first down. \nBut Oakland stalled, and Janikowski connected from 41 yards with 2:05 left for a 20-19 lead. \n“This was just one of those old-fashion NFL fights,” said Carr, who was 20 for 33 for 196 yards and two touchdowns. “Down to the wire. There was no lack of focus, or lack of effort.” \nThe Bears responded with a clutch 48-yard drive to Gould’s ninth field goal in nine tries this season. Martellus Bennett had a 7-yard reception on fourth-and-5 from the Chicago 25, and Eddie Royal had a 12-yard drive to get the Bears into Oakland territory. \n“We end up with a couple turnovers,” Raiders coach Jack Del Rio said. “We weren’t very efficient on third down. Defence couldn’t get off the field. Those are a couple of areas that will stand out. We’ll take ownership of what happened and look to make corrections and move on.” \nGould also connected from 54 yards, and Bennett finished with 11 catches for 83 yards and a touchdown. Cutler was 28 of 43 for 281 yards after missing a game because of a strained hamstring. \nCutler helped the Bears get off to a fast start with a 7-yard touchdown pass to Royal on the first drive of the game, but the extra point was blocked. Oakland then scored the next 14 points. \nCarr threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Cooper that was initially ruled an incompletion, and then overturned by a replay review. It was the second touchdown of the season for the rookie receiver. \nThe Raiders turned a botched exchange by the Bears into a go-ahead TD with 3 1/2 minutes left in the first half. Helu scored on a 4-yard reception. \nNOTES: Janikowski matched Hall of Fame WR Tim Brown for first on Raiders’ games played list with 240. ... The Bears lost C Will Montgomery to a broken fibula on the opening possession. ...
