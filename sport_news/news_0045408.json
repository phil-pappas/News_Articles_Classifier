John Hickenlooper, Sen. Michael Bennet and former Denver mayor Wellington Webb. The leadership council lets the campaign showcase its institutional muscle. It also lets it tap politicians and fundraisers who can generate both grassroots and financial support in the swing state.\nClinton's main rival is Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sanders drew thousands to a Denver rally in June, though he has much less establishment support.\nLast week Gov. Hickenlooper expressed many Democrats' unease about Clinton's campaign. He said he feared it could be the \"death knell\" if she broke the law by using her private email address while Secretary of State. Still, he remains a prominent backer.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T13:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:06:55.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
