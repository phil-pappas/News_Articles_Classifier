Tascoe will host a series of online episodes for the DIY Network. Maggie Beck / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. Jeribai Tascoe, a finalist in HGTV’s Design Star in 2013, has been selected to do online episodes for the DIY Network. The Sonora resident was the runner-up in HGTV’s eighth season of Design Star, a televised reality competition aimed at launching the careers of undiscovered design talent. “DIY Network is all about helping teach tips and tricks that make projects easier. They are also experts on designing, decorating and creating DIY projects,” Tascoe said. Tascoe kicked off the new 11-episode series, which was posted in August on the DIY Network. The first completed web series focused on teaching viewers how to use the basic tools that are often needed in creating many DIY projects to create a castor table out of copper. All 11 episodes were filmed in DIY Network’s headquarters in Knoxville, Tennessee, in two days. When it came to creating DIY projects in his day-to-day life Tascoe has custom-made sound-proofed sound boxes in his studio where his drums are. Hidden behind two pieces of artwork are materials meant to soak up the extra sound before allowing it escape into other portions of his house. Along the entire of the wall behind the set of drums is multi-colored materials also meant for soundproofing. Tascoe also has a custom-made desk in his studio for his music equipment. DIY Network came to Tascoe asking him to be on their roster for the online episodes, he said. “They are a very collaborative network, they really know what they’re doing,” Tascoe said. Tascoe says about 90 percent of his career involves working privately with clients on design projects including architectural and graphic designs, while the other 10 percent goes to hosting shows and other projects. Tascoe has plans to film another series in October with DIY Network, but could not disclose the topic. “It isn’t a contract, but when they have a new series for me that’s when they sign me onto each individual project,” Tascoe said. “I love the experience,” he said.
