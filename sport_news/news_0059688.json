The Cardinals (4-1) would have recovered the fumble, but Tony Jefferson touched the ball while his leg was out of bounds. \nThe Lions scored their only touchdown of the game on their third possession, after two turnovers, then turned the ball over twice more before halftime. \nStafford threw his second interception early in the second quarter, and one series after the Cardinals scoured on a 99-yard drive – John Brown beat Darius Slay for a 49-yard pass to get Arizona out of its own end zone, then Chris Johnson broke a 40-yard run two plays later – Golden Tate fumbled away a catch. \nOrlovsky, who had not thrown a pass since 2012, joined the turnover brigade, throwing an interception in the fourth quarter. \nOrlovsky completed 21 of 38 passes for 191 yards and led the Lions to two meaningless scores in the fourth quarter. The Lions' 70 pass attempts tied an NFL record. \nThe Lions, who play their next two games at home against division opponents the Chicago Bears and Minnesota Vikings before heading to London to take on the Kansas City Chiefs, now have to figure out what to do with Stafford. \nTwo years ago, Stafford signed a three-year extension with the Lions worth $41.7 million. \nThe Lions can get out of the deal without owing Stafford, who turns 28 in February, any more money after this season. He still would count $11 million against the salary cap if the Lions decide to go in another direction. \nJohnson finished with 103 yards rushing on 11 carries and Carson Palmer completed 11 of 14 passes for 161 yards and three touchdowns for the Cardinals before giving way to Drew Stanton in the fourth quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:19:10.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
