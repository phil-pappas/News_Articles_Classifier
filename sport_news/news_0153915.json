Just do what we have recently finished doing here at Herald News Sports – making a list of the top 25 all-time athletes from Greater Fall River high schools. I remember when Mike Thomas and I began throwing names around, before serious research started. Names popped into my head of males and females who were “automatics”. The problem was, before we knew it, the “automatic” list had blown past 25. There were tough decisions to be made, with the decisions getting tougher and tougher as Mike T. began pulling clips from files and started his many visits to our top floor library of giant books filled with old and very old editions of The Herald News. Mike either loves archive research, or he loves dust. Top 25 was certainly an education for this lifelong Greater Fall River resident. Before this project began, I don’t think I had any idea who Billy Burgess was. He ended up No. 5 on our list. Not sure, either, if I could have told you anything about No. 13 Tommy Harrington, or even what school he came from. The project also served to remind us of just how much some athletes excelled. I covered Aimee Lecomte in the 1980s yet it was still amazing to review and re-digest her volleyball career – a four-year standout for Case volleyball, four straight state titles (the latter two in Division 1), and player of the year her senior year. Should Aimee have wound up even higher on our list? Sometimes I wondered. Still do. But if so, whom would she bump back? There was a lot of that kind of pondering as we worked to finalize our list. I got multiple phone calls campaigning for Mike Medeiros (Durfee, 1976) to get on the list. I already knew Mike had been a sensational infielder for Durfee baseball. He was also a scrappy guard on some very good basketball teams. During a phone call from Jim Mercer one night, I learned Medeiros was a three-sport man. During his junior year, at the urging and daring of football coach Ed Keyes, Medeiros agreed to join the Hilltoppers after the season had began. A running back and defensive back, he earned all-star honors. Point proven, he hung up his shoulder pads and did not play football his senior year. Mercer, himself among the upper echelon off all-time Durfee athletes, said Medeiros was the best high school athlete he had ever seen. Told he was getting consideration for our Top 25 list, Mercer said, “Give my votes to Mike.” I wondered, at times, if I gave enough consideration to the athletes I have covered since 1980. Tim Furtado was a terrific three-sport athlete and another in the long line of outstanding Durfee catchers. Did he belong on the list? What about Karen Ferreira? Andrea Costa? Terry Pacheco? Adam Couitt? Kyle Quinn? Page 2 of 3 - To the end, some thought Jerry Remy might be No. 1. A junior varsity baseball player his sophomore year, Remy missed a decent chunk of junior year due to injury before his great senior year. Peter Suneson (1970s) was a name that was often mentioned. Bill Corey was something extra special. Today at the golf course, Durfee Hall of Famer Bob Dempsey sang to me the praises of Tommy Doyle. Phil Lussier was such a great distance runner. What about one or more of the Cote sisters who spearheaded (perhaps “tsukaharaed” would be a better term) a state gymnastics dynasty at Somerset High School? What about Brian O’Neil? Bethany Barrar? Ron Marcellus? Paul Reis? Joe Santos? Roger Dupont? Frank Ferraz? Dan LePage? Buddy Andrew? Caleb Bliss? JoAnne Medeiros? Amos DaLuz? Sue St. Laurent? Sue Kitchen? Bishop Connolly hoops coach Bill Shea pushed hard for Cougar alum Joe Shaker. Ben Berube is the best soccer player I’ve seen (sorry, Rui). He played a game different from anyone else I saw. Going back to the beginning of the century, we had Sanford White of Durfee scoring 90 points in a basketball game against Providence English. More significantly, he became a football All-American at Princeton, Durfee’s first college All-American, according to Hilltopper sports historian (unofficial title) Manny Papoula, himself another top-notch athlete. We could have done top 100 athletes and not have had a watered down field. Or we could have done just the top 25 baseball players. Heck, if we did the top baseball (or softball) pitchers, we’d fill 25 spots in a hurry. Based on what I have learned, a list of just Durfee’s top 25 baseball pitchers would be great. Back to the Top 25 athletes project. From the start, the choice for No. 1 athlete, in my mind, came down to Tom Gastall or Joe Andrews. Research did nothing to change that position. M. Thomas and I struggled with the choice for a few weeks before settling on Mr. Gastall. Yes, we know the Joe Andrews camp has many members. Through the years, Joe Andrews’ athletic reputation has remained in the local sports consciousness more so than Gastall’s. Perhaps that’s because it became well known that Andrews had been a good friend of and unofficial body guard for Hank Aaron when the two were minor league baseball teammates. In his autobiography, Hank praised Joe for both his baseball talent and integrity. People know about Joe Andrews. I think we have helped remind Greater Fall River about the late Tom Gastall (Durfee, 1951), who, yes, is the father of Tom Gastall, the terrific Durfee basketball player in the 1970s. Based on what I have read and more so on what people like Skip Karam, Carlin Lynch, Angelo Stavros have told me, it’s obvious the elder Gastall fell into that elite category of great athlete who was an even better person. Would love to have somehow known him. Page 3 of 3 - Son Tom Gastall, principal at Westport Elementary School, said the other day he has most enjoyed having people tell him what a kind person his dad was. (Footnote for the curious: The Gastalls are not Tom Sr. and Tom Jr. Dad was Thomas Everett, son is Thomas Michael. Thomas Everett Gastall was a Jr.) The reaction to the Top 25 project has been what we had hoped for. People have been talking it up quite a bit, both on social media and face to face. More than a few folks made it a point to be on heraldnews.com each day at 12:01 a.m. to see who was next on the list. This may be why some of you high school students have seen your teachers yawning extra long the last three weeks or so. In terms of inevitable complaints, folks have been largely respectful and we’ve had only one ultra-angry profanity-laced phone call from someone unhappy with his/her place on the list. Mike Thomas dealt with that one. He’s the boss. And, PLEASE, do not hesitate to send us your version of the Top 25. Probably the best bet would be Facebook (HNNow).
