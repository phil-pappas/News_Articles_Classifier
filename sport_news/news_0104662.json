Sandwich, a school with a smaller enrollment than Durfee (which plays in the Big Three Conference), torched the Hilltoppers, 36-22. “Our school’s definitely smaller,” defensive coordinator Wayne MacDonald said. “We knew they were going to have a lot of really good athletes. We tried our best to game plan in practice the best we could, defensively and offensively to be able to counterattack their athletic ability with not only our athletic ability but also our game plan to stop their running and passing threat.” Sandwich (3-2) “game planned” well on defense, considering Jake Carter intercepted three passes, Sam Whittle intercepted another, Mitch MacDonald recovered a fumble and Kevin Shea blocked a punt and ran it in for a touchdown. Offensively, Ryan McNally gained 55 hard-earned yards and scored twice while quarterback Tyler Cairns passed for 114 yards and one touchdown. “They all played very well on offense and defense,” coach MacDonald said. “We focused on being opportunistic on the defensive side of the ball. I think we did a good job creating turnovers and winning the turnover battle.” Sandwich bolted to a 14-0 lead with the first score set up by Carter’s initial pick as Frank Kelleher busted off tackle from the 5. After Mitch MacDonald recovered a fumble on the ensuing kickoff, McNally ran it in from the 5. The Hilltoppers (1-4) countered when Jaren Vieira threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Colin Medeiros and Elijah Brooks (22-201-2) scored from the 5 and then ran in for a two-point conversion. That scenario gave Durfee a 15-14 lead at the half. “It’s not what we planned for,” coach MacDonald said of that deficit. “But it’s something we’re ready for, facing adversity. “It’s something that builds our strength moving forward. We’ve done it in the past, but we hope not to have to do it in the future. But we know it’s going to happen so it’s good to know we can deal with it.” Sandwich commenced dealing with adversity on Durfee’s first possession of the second half when Shea scored on his blocked punt. Then, late in the third, Cam Lopes caught a 25-yard TD pass from Cairns for a 29-15 lead. McNally accounted for his team’s final score on a seven-yard run with 36 seconds left in the third.
