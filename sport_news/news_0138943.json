Winners \nKirk Cousins — Like most middling, inconsistent quarterbacks, there is Good Kirk and there is bad Kirk. This was Very Good Kirk , from the mistake-free football throughout to the 90-yard game-winning drive at the end. It was a tantalizing glimpse of what we hope will be the future, but we’d like to see him do it again next week. (Bonus points for the burgundy suit .) \nPierre Garcon — Continues an odd season of very short receptions (only nine yards/catch), but that touchdown at the end was so impressive. A great moment for him, and a ray of light for the franchise. \nJamison Crowder — Led the team in targets with 12 (no one else had more than eight). Seems to have supplanted Andre Roberts as the slot guy, and rightfully so. \nAlfred Morris — Only 17 yards on 62 carries, but he reasserted himself a bit as the alpha back, and he was huge on that final drive. \nChris Thompson — Ninety total yards? He had 133 in all of 2013-14 plus the start of this year. Looks like he’s the third-down back. \nThe Hogs — One sack on 46 dropbacks, and four yards/carry against a tough run defense. That’s how you possess the ball for 41-plus minutes, and that’s generally how you win games. \nChris Baker — Two sacks for the big boy, and a nice celebration dance, which he said was the “Milly Rock.” Here’s how you too can do the Milly Rock. \nTrent Murphy — A big sack and a fun lateral-interception of sorts on the final drive. \nBashaud Breeland — He really is our best corner, isn’t he? \nDustin Hopkins — One hundred-percent touchback rate. \nJay Gruden — As usual, he needed this . And I thought he called a pretty good game, too. \n— michael phillips (@michaelpRTD) October 4, 2015 Losers \nJordan Reed — The fumble was tough. The concussion is even tougher. Hopefully he’s able to (safely) return quickly, unlike 2013, when he missed the last six weeks of the season. \nChris Culliver — Showed toughness playing through a knee injury. Still got burnt for two touchdowns. \nMatt Jones — Had nowhere to run (11 yards on seven carries). \nRyan Grant — Didn’t do much, but was targeted a season-high seven times. \nTress Way — When punting from the other team’s 35-yard-line, it’s best to not put it five yards deep in their end zone. \n— Chris Mottram (@ChrisMottram) October 4, 2015 Medium \nWe the fans — Let’s stay this way, despite beating a division rival to move into a three-way tie for first before a Week 5 matchup with the 4-0 Falcons. \nRyan Kerrigan — Finally sacked Sam Bradford on the final drive after whiffing on him at least twice earlier in the game. It was his first full sack of the season. Here’s to many more.
