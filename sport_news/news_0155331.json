(AP) - Lauderdale County Administrator David Engel has announced his resignation.\nThe Meridian Star reports ( http://bit.ly/1O6D4Z6 ) Engel resigned Thursday at the Board of Supervisor's work session.\nEngel has been the county administrator for 14 months. He says he will be returning to his former position with Fortenberry & Ballard PC of Brandon, where he worked for eight years. Before joining the Brandon accountant firm, he was a state auditor for 10 years.\nEngel says the move has nothing to do with his time spent with the board, but it allows for a better financial opportunity for his family.\nThe supervisors will begin advertising for a replacement following Monday's board meeting.\nInformation from: The Meridian Star, http://www.meridianstar.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
