No one ever stays undefeated in the Pac-12 Conference. \nUSC (4-3, 2-2 Pac-12) brought Utah down to Earth after the Utes (6-1, 3-1) were on cloud nine since Week 1. \nThe Trojans took an early lead, scoring a touchdown on their first drive of the game. The Utes responded with a 30-yard touchdown by Britain Covey. Quarterback Travis Wilson threw a beautiful pass to Covey to give the freshman receiver a career-long reception. \n— Andrew Fox (@FoxOnABox_) October 25, 2015 \n— somehow juking multiple defenders — for 41 yards to the 2-yard line, where Utah scored on the next play with the help of receiver Bubba Poole. Covey's second touchdown of the night came late in the fourth quarter and was 66 yards long. \npic.twitter.com/5WPJafwWB1 — Dr. Saturday (@YahooDrSaturday) October 25, 2015 — Avery Mills (@alynn422) October 25, 2015 — Barles Charkley (@Hookemcougs) October 25, 2015 \net the Travis Wilson that has directv and not cable pls — Shon (@redsoxunixgeek) October 25, 2015 \n— such as a potential trip to the Rose Bowl.
