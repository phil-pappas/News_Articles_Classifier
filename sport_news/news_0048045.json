The Blue Devils played Lewis and Clark, Chewelah, Cheney, Pullman, West Valley and Kennewick. “This was a terrific weekend to get a ton of reps in and find our groove,” Wa-Hi coach Kim McDaniel said. “In pool play, we played every team really close and had a real opportunity to finish first in pool play. By the end of the day, we finished on a high note beating Kennewick, 25-14. After a long day and five matches, its hard to maintain that level and we did.” The Blue Devils finished 39th out of 61 teams at the tournament. Emily Dimino helped Wa-Hi with 20 digs on the day, with Karli Plucker coming up with 18. Selina Atkinson had an ace, five kills and 12 digs, Noelani Helm smacked five aces and had 25 kills, three blocks and 13 digs, Emily Hedine recorded six aces, six kills, and 26 digs. Faith Hoe had 13 kills and three digs, Kamryn Coleman had three aces, nine kills, three blocks and seven digs, Tara Krivoshein had four aces, 10 kills, two blocks, 59 assists and 20 digs, and Emma Wenzel came up with 24 kills and five blocks. “I’m excited to put these things together for the second half of our season matches,” McDaniel said. Wa-Hi, now 0-8 in MCC play, 3-11 overall, host Hanford at 7 p.m. Tuesday.
