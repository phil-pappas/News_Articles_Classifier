The 79-year-old organist has been playing at Dodger Stadium for 28 years. \nHefley took over from Helen Dell in 1988 and has become as much a fan favorite as Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully and retired manager Tom Lasorda. She began playing the piano at age 4 and at 13 she talked her teacher into showing her the basics of the organ. \nHefley commutes to each homestand from her home in Silver Springs, Nevada, while renting a second home locally. She is accompanied by her husband, Bill, whom she met while playing the organ at church. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:29:27.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
