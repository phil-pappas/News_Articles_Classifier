The Cavaliers jumped on Delcastle wrapping up things early in some extremely windy and sometimes rainy conditions. Itâ€™s the sixth straight meeting between the two teams where Middletown has scored at least 40 points and kept Delcastle to eight points or less. The victory makes it two in a row for the Cavaliers who have now scored at least 35 points in each of their three wins this season. After a largely uneventful week four, Middletown goes back on the road next week traveling to Baynard Stadium to take on Salesianum Friday night at 7:30 p.m. Stay tuned for a preview of this big match up next week at middletowntranscript.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:02:07.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
