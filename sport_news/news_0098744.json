The most important thing the coaching staff wanted out of Kurt Palandech was to make some plays with his feet and not make the big mistake. While he was able to do some good things with the ball in his hands, Palandech’s two interceptions proved costly. His first came with UNLV in field goal range midway through the first quarter. The Rebels had momentum and were looking to really put San Jose State on its heels early in the game. Palandech had man-to-man coverage, but severely underthrew his receiver down the right sideline. The second pick was even more devastating. UNLV had a 10-3 lead in the second quarter and was driving. Palandech made a poor read in San Jose State territory and his interception was run back all the way to the UNLV 11-yard line. The Spartans tied the game on the next play. UNLV ran up 186 yards on the ground, but Palandech completed just 15 of 30 attempts for 217 yards. He also took terrible third-down sacks on the final possession of regulation and the only possession of overtime. Nicolai Bornand overcame the first, but the second proved costly.\nDEFENSE: C-plus\nUNLV did a pretty decent job of keeping Tyler Ervin in check. The San Jose State running back entered the game second in the nation in both rushing and all-purpose yards. His stats looked pretty good when all was said and done, but the Rebels accomplished what they wanted by making him earn every yard. Ervin had 73 yards on 18 carries and gained 74 yards on eight receptions. He added 100 yards on four kickoff returns. All in all, it was a fine effort by the defense. The plan was to make San Jose State quarterback Kenny Potter beat them with his arm and he actually played well. After a slow start, Potter completed 30 of 48 passes for 329 yards and two scores. Of course, the touchdown on fourth-and-10 in the waning minutes of regulation will haunt this unit. So will the inability to get a stop in overtime and at least force a field goal attempt. But UNLV did what it wanted on defense for the most of the night. San Jose State just executed a bit better.\nSPECIAL TEAMS: B\nBornand had a field goal blocked in overtime, which was a combination of a low kick and pressure from the left side of the line. UNLV would have never been in the extra session if not for his pressure-packed 49-yarder in the closing seconds of regulation. The special teams also limited Ervin’s kickoff returns to an average of 25 yards and Logan Yunker kept the ball away from him on punts. The Rebels recovered a fumble when Ervin muffed a punt in the fourth quarter as well. It was just the pesky blocked field goal at such a crucial time that kept the unit from getting an A. To be fair, the kick was attempted from farther back than it should have been because of Palandech taking an inexcusable sack on the previous play.\nCOACHING: B-minus\nIt has to be mentioned once again the defense getting burned on the blitz call late in regulation. The coaching staff was out-smarted on the play and it helped San Jose State escape with the win. Credit must be given to Tony Sanchez and his staff for UNLV avoiding a major letdown after an emotional win in the rivalry game last week. The Rebels started quickly and fought valiantly at the end after falling behind. UNLV also put together a solid plan to contain Tyler Ervin. In the end, Sanchez and his staff put the players in a position to win. That’s their job. San Jose State just made more plays.\nContact reporter Adam Hill at ahill@reviewjournal.com or 702-224-5509 .
