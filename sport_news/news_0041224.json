Most had cleats, but some had to wear tennis shoes. \nThe team wasn’t able to practice Monday, but instead held a film session. \nStadium will play the rest of its home games in Lincoln Bowl at Lincoln High School after Saturday’s flood damaged Stadium’s home field and ruined equipment left in the team’s locker room located on the field level. \n“I hate that our seniors won’t be able to play their senior night at home, but our guys are road warriors,” Ford said. “This is a mentally tough group of guys so I feel like they are just going to roll with the punches.” \nFord said the shoulder pads are scheduled to arrive Wednesday before practice and that coaches from Tacoma’s other public schools — Foss, Lincoln, Mount Tahoma and Wilson — reached out to donate pads if the team needed. \nFriday is Timberline’s homecoming game. \nFord said that Sports Authority will donate cleats to players who lost theirs to the flood, though Stadium has reached out to the University of Washington to get cleats for players — such as some of their linemen — who would have to special order cleats. \nThe Stadium football booster club created a Stadium Flood Fund through Columbia Bank for those who wish to offer donations. \nThe team also lost about 10 helmets, Ford said, but the team had enough of a back stock to compensate. Ford took inventory of the lost equipment Tuesday. \nTJ Cotterill: 253-597-8677", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:54:01.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
