Check. What's next? Driveway sit-ups? \nOdell Beckham Jr. got emotional after the New York Giants rallied for a 30-27 win over the 49ers on Sunday night. He was on the verge of tears in an interview afterward, explaining: \"Just happy we won.\" \nBeckham finished with seven catches for 121 yards but injured his hamstring on a touchdown catch and returned only as a decoy during the final series. \nPerhaps he was overcome with joy after a difficult week. He was fined for punching a Bills player in a win at Buffalo and Jets cornerback Antonio Cromartie called him \"a one-year wonder.\" \nTerrell Owens once broke down while defending Tony Romo after the Cowboys lost a playoff game in January 2008. \"That's my teammate. That's my quarterback,\" Owens said as his bottom lip quivered and his voice wavered while his eyes hid behind black sunglasses. \nDon't sweat it, Giants fans. A little emotion doesn't mean Beckham is going to follow Owens' quirky footsteps. Then again, is that a bad thing? Only Jerry Rice had more yards receiving than Owens and only Rice and Randy Moss had more touchdown catches. \nHere are other overreactions from Week 5: \nOVERREACTION: A losing team will win the NFC East like Carolina did in the NFC South last year. The Giants are the only winning team at 3-2 while the Cowboys, Redskins and Eagles are 2-3. \nREALISTIC REACTION: Eli Manning and the Giants would be 5-0 if they didn't squander late leads. The Cowboys are too talented to lose every game without Romo and Dez Bryant. Maybe Matt Cassel helps them. The Eagles are better than their record. \n___ \nOVERREACTION: The Bengals already locked up the AFC North. They're 5-0 with a two-game lead over the Steelers. \nREALISTIC REACTION: Andy Dalton is off to an MVP start, but the Bengals haven't dominated teams. Plus they have two games with Pittsburgh left and tough road games at Buffalo, Arizona and Denver. \n___ \nOVERREACTION: Give Peyton Manning and the Broncos another AFC West title. Denver is 5-0 with a three-game lead over the Chargers and Chiefs. \nREALISTIC REACTION: The Broncos are winning on defense and Manning is clearly not the quarterback he was. They have a tough schedule in November and two games against San Diego. \n___ \nOVERREACTION: The Falcons and Panthers are heading for an NFC championship game showdown. \nREALISTIC REACTION: They're both unbeaten and likely won't be challenged in the NFC South, but neither team has looked unbeatable. The Packers (5-0) and Cardinals (4-1) are still the favorites in the NFC. \n___ \nOVERREACTION: Josh McCown is the new Tom Brady. McCown threw for a team-record 457 yards in Cleveland's overtime win at Baltimore. He has a 102.8 passer rating. \nREALISTIC REACTION: McCown has racked up some of his great numbers against poor passing defenses (Ravens and Raiders). He's playing well, but there's a reason why he's started 53 games in 13 seasons. \n___ \nOVERREACTION: DeMarco Murray is back to his All-Pro form. Murray ran for 83 yards and a touchdown on 20 carries in Philadelphia's 39-17 win over New Orleans. \nREALISTIC REACTION: The defending NFL rushing champion is still averaging only 2.7 yards per carry after a decent game against the third-worst run defense in the NFL. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n___ \nFollow Rob Maaddi on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AP_RobMaaddi Copyright The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:51:22.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
