But I was also confident that we could score against them, so we’ve been preparing for them over the past few practices,” said Haverhill coach Fred Tarbox. \n“Right before, I reiterated to the girls how big a game it would be, we’d need the points for the tournament, and the girls really put together a really good effort.” \nAndover applied heaps of pressure to the Haverhill defense, forcing goalie Jessica Kramer to make 15 saves and probably taking another dozen shots that weren’t on net. None found paydirt, however, and Haverhill was able to get goals from Audrey Therriault and Amanda Van Cor to secure the win. \nEx-Andover coach Dick Loschi said the rivalry began in 1994 and the Hillies never beat Andover when he was coaching from 1994-05. Tribune records go back through the 2000 season, and between 2000 and 2011, Andover went 14-0 and outscored the Hillies 59-2. \nBut since then, things have started to turn around. Andover and Haverhill played to a scoreless draw in 2012, and then in 2013 the Hillies beat the Warriors for the first time by a score of 3-1. Andover regained the upper hand last year, but with Tuesday’s win, Haverhill now holds a 2-1-1 advantage over the past four years. \n“I think you’re seeing that our program has really turned around,” Tarbox said. “It means a lot to me. It means a lot that we can go against a strong opponent and do what it takes to beat them, but it also means a lot that in four years we’ve only lost to them once.” \nBeyond the historic implications of the win, it was also a huge lift for the Hillies in the short run. Haverhill (5-3-2) has now won five of its last six games and is firmly back in the postseason picture after going winless for nearly the first month of the season. \nHaverhill will look to keep its momentum going when it hosts Lawrence on Thursday at 7:15 p.m. Andover, meanwhile, is now 3-4-2 and will look to bounce back tomorrow at home against Billerica at 7 p.m. \nHaverhill 2, Andover 0 \nGoals: Audrey Therriault, Amanda Van Cor \nAssists: none \nSaves: H — Jessica Kramer 15 \nAndover (3-4-2): 0 0 — 0 \nHaverhill (5-3-2): 1 1 — 2 Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:08:08.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
