I don't think I am,\" Murray said following that defeat. \"I don't need to go to any one (of the coaches). It is what it is.\"\nSince that loss, Murray has carried the ball at least 20 times in Philadelphia's last two games and scored in each.\nThe Eagles have won both games.\nMurray is still a long way from last season' pace when he scored 13 times, but there now appears to be light at the end of the tunnel for the 27-year-old.\n\"Coming in from Dallas there's obviously a lot of difference. But I think I've been able to adjust well,\" Murray told the New York Post last week.\n\"You just go out there and work as hard as you can and try to make as many plays as you can when your number is called.\"\n(Writing by Jahmal Corner in Los Angeles; Editing by Greg Stutchbury)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T09:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:33:55.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
