I've spent most of my career in jails ... working in jails.\"\nFirman was given the oath of office by Denver County Court Judge John Marcucci during a quick ceremony in the Wellington Webb Municipal Office Building.\nFirman's wife and daughter drove in from Illinois for the ceremony. His son could not travel because of schoolwork.\nFirman has 24 years of experience working in jails in two suburban Chicago counties. For the past year, he has worked as a law enforcement consultant.\nThe jails where Firman has worked are smaller and less diverse than what he will oversee in Denver. But Firman has said his foundation is solid and that he is prepared to take the reigns of a troubled department that is undergoing a massive reform .\nAdvertisement Firman, who spent Friday meeting with the department's senior leaders, said he is ready to get to work.\n\"Like most people who work in jails, we don't put a lot of stock in what people say,\" he said. \"We put stock in what people do.\"\nMayor Michael Hancock announced his intention to find a new sheriff in July 2014 . After a national search conducted by Chicago-based Hillard Heintze, Firman was selected from 25 applicants.\nHis hiring was announced abruptly Thursday morning, much to the surprise of many community members who had been heavily involved in the sheriff's department reform.\nChief Elias Diggins had been serving as interim sheriff but has run into trouble in the past month. An internal affairs investigation is on- going after he was accused in September of releasing a suspect in custody, and he was embarrassed by a secretly recorded phone call that surfaced during a disciplinary hearing for a former chief who had been fired.\nNews Newsletter and Updates Subscribe for updates and our roundup on Front Range news, delivered to your inbox daily.\nHancock said Thursday those recent events were not connected to the sudden announcement that Firman would be sheriff.\nHancock said again Friday that Firman was the sheriff he had been searching for. Firman's references were impeccable, the mayor said.\n\"He will do the right thing while also leading a dynamic department,\" Hancock said.\nNoelle Phillips: 303-954-1661, nphillips@denverpost.com or @Noelle_Phillips", "external_links": ["http://denverpostplus.com/app/mailer-rules/www/", "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Andada|Montserrat:400,700|Open+Sans:400,800,700,400italic"], "published": "2015-10-16T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:06:17.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
