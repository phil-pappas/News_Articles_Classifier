Player: Carlton AikenSchool: Paulsboro High School (NJ)Graduating Class: 2016Height and Weight: 6'2\", 180 lbs.Camp attended: Harrisburg (March) Ed O.B.'s take: Due to the nature of the camp, Aiken wasn't able to display his total skill-set as a quarterback. However, Aiken did show nice touch on his throws whether he threw from the pocket or on the run. Aiken also displayed some of the best footwork among all of the quarterbacks at the March camp.Season report: Aiken has completed 41 out of 71 passes for 556 yards and six touchdowns through four games. Aiken has also ran 37 times for 251 yards and three rushing touchdowns. What Aiken couldn't display, due to the nature of prospect camps, is the effect he has on the game as a true dual-threat quarterback. Aiken can make throws in the pocket. Aiken is dangerous when he rolls out of the pocket and makes defenders guess on whether to stay in coverage or come up and try to tackle him. In his last game against Gateway Regional (NJ), Aiken ran the ball 11 times for 150 yards and scored two touchdowns on the ground. He didn't have to pass much, but he did complete 4 out of 7 passes for 54 yards and another touchdown through the air. Aiken currently has offers from New Hampshire, Cornell, and Central Connecticut State.
