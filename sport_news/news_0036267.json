The B’s were going to be a solid, winning team, a virtual lock to make the playoffs and perhaps an elite-level club that could compete for the Stanley Cup.\n2. There would always be a fairly large number of Eastern Conference teams that wouldn’t be very good, teams the B’s could expect to defeat with regularity.\nWell, as the 2015-16 season opens for the Bruins tonight at the Garden against the Winnipeg Jets, neither of those presumptions holds true anymore.\nYears of mismanagement in the B’s front office — which cost the team key, difference-making players like Jarome Iginla, Andrew Ference, Johnny Boychuk and Milan Lucic, while failing to restock the organization adequately via the draft — led to a hasty rebuild of the roster this offseason.\nThe efforts by new general manager Don Sweeney appear to have gone about as well as could be hoped, but the Bruins enter the season with a giant question mark hanging over them.\nWill the new-look team bounce back after missing the playoffs for the first time since 2006-07 and be a force in the Eastern Conference? Or will the B’s struggle and will the many young and fast-improving teams in the East leave them behind?\nJust consider the perennial non-playoff teams that looked so much improved last year: Islanders, Senators, Panthers and Blue Jackets. The Sabres should be much better. Even the Maple Leafs, minus the distractions of old friend Phil Kessel and with new leadership from coach Mike Babcock and general manager Lou Lamoriello, are due for an upgrade.\nAnd, of course, Montreal, Tampa Bay, Detroit, the New York Rangers, Washington and Pittsburgh remain powerful clubs.\nThe math is not pretty when you try to find a place in the conference’s top eight for the Bruins.\nIf they are going to return to the playoffs, two fundamental things must occur. First, the key incumbent, in-their-prime players like Patrice Bergeron, Brad Marchand, Loui Eriksson, David Krejci, David Pastrnak, Ryan Spooner, Adam McQuaid, Torey Krug and Tuukka Rask all have to have good, consistent years. That means the kids — Spooner and Pastrnak — must perform at a high level in their first full NHL seasons. Are they ready to do that? Maybe.\nAnother part of the equation is that 38-year-old Zdeno Chara and 34-year-old Dennis Seidenberg, a pair of defensemen with plenty of wear and tear to their bodies, must remain healthy and provide heavy, quality minutes.\nAnd the second fundamental necessity is there is little margin for error in regard to a slew of newcomers. If any of them fails to deliver what the club expects, it will create a nasty hole in the lineup. Conversely, if they all are as good as advertised, the B’s will be a pretty good team, very capable of getting into the postseason and sticking around for a few weeks.\nThat means:\n• Free agent signee Matt Beleskey must prove his strong season last year in Anaheim — not the six so-so pro seasons that preceded it — was the real deal.\n• Brett Connolly, a former No. 6 overall pick, has to prove his obvious tools in skating and shooting can make him an upper-echelon player.\n• And young defensemen Zach Trotman, Colin Miller and Joe Morrow must show that, yes, they can push the pace and attack, but more importantly, they can play a sound and smart game in the defensive zone.\nThe glass-half-empty person can look at all the uncertain commodities, figure it’s impossible they’re all going to work out in an optimum way, and conclude the next six months will not be pretty for the Bruins.\nA glass-half-full guy, like Claude Julien, has faith all the pieces will fall into place perfectly.\n“I’ve got a lot of confidence in these guys from what I’ve seen in the last three-plus weeks,” the Bruins coach said. “They seem to be a really good group that I think they will handle it well.”\nThe key phrase in that sentence might be “seem to be.” We’ll all find out quickly if this team truly is as good at it seems it could be.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:33:08.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
