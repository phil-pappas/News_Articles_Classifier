(AP Photo/Colin E. Braley) \nKANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) — Kyle Busch raced to his fifth Xfinity Series victory of the year and record-extending 75th overall, outdueling Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Matt Kenseth on Saturday at Kansas Speedway. \nBusch became the winningest NASCAR driver in Kansas Speedway history with four. He also won Xfinity races in 2007 and 2014 and a NASCAR Truck event in 2014. \nAfter Kenseth led the first 117 laps and 148 in all, Busch grabbed the lead for good in his Toyota with 15 laps to go. Joey Logano was third, followed by Ty Dillon, Regan Smith and points leader Chris Buescher. \nBusch appeared to have seized control on the 147th lap, but during a caution, he ran into debris that damaged the right front and dropped him back into the field. When the race resumed to green-flag racing, Busch returned to contention and rode Kenseth’s bumper before taking the lead. \nAnother caution with four laps to go extended the race to a green-white-checkered finish.
