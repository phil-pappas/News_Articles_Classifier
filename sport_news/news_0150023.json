Patterson) × \nCOLUMBIA, Mo. — As enthused as Steve Spurrier was with the progress his defense and his true freshman starting quarterback had made, he harbored no illusions as to the competition it had come against. “The test is still out there for us,” South Carolina’s head coach remarked after a 31-14 victory over a Central Florida team which is likely to be the worst Football Bowl Subdivision opponent the Gamecocks play all season. \nNow, none of that is meant to undermine the spark USC clearly showed in the second half against the Knights, or the development first-time starting signal-caller Lorenzo Nunez displayed from first snap to last. But indeed the test remains, and it begins at noon today in another Columbia, against an opponent which for the Gamecocks could provide the best barometer yet of what might be to come. \nStruggling to shake off non-power-five opponents? Losing to Kentucky? Starting a true freshman quarterback? Right now South Carolina and Missouri are mirror images of one another, right down to the nervousness in their respective fan bases, and the names of the towns in which they are located. \nSo, as the folks at the Emergency Broadcast System might say — this is indeed a test. Missouri is not the same team it was last season, not with Shane Ray and Markus Golden in the NFL, not with Kentrell Brothers and Russell Hansbrough injured, not with Maty Mauk suspended. There are reasons this team survived close shaves against the likes of Arkansas State and Connecticut. \nAnd the Gamecocks are hardly blowing up the scoreboard. As impressive as that Nunez-led offense was in the second half, early on there remained that lingering problem of capitalizing on red-zone opportunities, and there are still awfully few playmakers outside of the quarterback and star receiver Pharoh Cooper. Starting tailback Brandon Wilds will sit today, still recovering from a cracked rib suffered Sept. 19 against Georgia. Starting wide receiver Deebo Samuel is out as well, due to a strained hamstring which has been bothering him since Sept. 3 against North Carolina. \nIn their absence, it’s going to be up to the likes of Shon Carson and D.J. Neal to step up and take the load off USC’s only two proven playmakers. The Gamecocks have moved in fits and starts all season, ranking 97th nationally in total offense. The good news Saturday: Missouri is even worse at 119th. No wonder so many Tigers fans are hardly disappointed that true freshman Drew Lock is starting behind center today. \n(For what it’s worth: Sports Information here at Missouri tells me they’re looking into the last time two freshman quarterbacks started against one another in the SEC. Nobody seems to keep those kinds of records, but we’ll let you know if anything turns up.) \nFrom a South Carolina perspective, hope has to lie in the six series the Gamecocks used to score their 26 unanswered points against UCF. From late in the second quarter to late in the fourth, USC got points out of five of six possessions and rolled up 291 yards of total offense, against a defense which was hardly as terrible as the Knights’ winless record might suggest. Is that the real South Carolina? Is that hint of what the Gamecocks are capable of under Nunez? Or is that another mirage, like Perry Orth’s second-half performance against Kentucky? \nToday, we begin to find out. Nunez takes a significant step up — on the road, against an SEC team, and versus a defense ranked No. 1 in the conference and No. 7 nationally. The Gamecocks find themselves in the unenviable positon of probably having to win a league road game to maintain bowl-eligibility hopes, with No. 9 LSU, Leonard Fournette, and the very real prospect of a 2-4 start looming next week. \nBut series history and current circumstances suggest Missouri remains a winnable game. For the first time all season, the Gamecocks have some cohesion on offense with the quarterback positon evidently settled. Now they’re back at Faurot Field, home of the rock M in one end zone and the goal post that saved the Miracle at Missouri on their last visit, ready to begin the test in earnest.
