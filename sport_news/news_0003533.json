South Africa innings \nQuinton de Kock, Faf du Plessis and captain A.B. de Villiers smashed centuries on Sunday as South Africa notched a mammoth 438-4 against India in the fifth and final one-day international. De Villiers capped the innings with 119 off 61 deliveries as South Africa put itself in a strong position to clinch its first bilateral series win in India after the two sides went into the game with the series level 2-2. The South Africans scored at will on a flat pitch with left-handed opener De Kock setting the platform with 109 and Du Plessis dominating the middle overs with 133. It was the highest ever total against India and only the second instance of three batsmen getting centuries in an ODI innings. The earlier feat was also registered by South Africa against the West Indies earlier this year when de Villiers had recorded the fastest ever ODI century off just 31 balls. Hashim Amla and Rilee Rossouw were the other centurions in that innings. De Villiers struck his third century of the series, bludgeoning 11 sixes and three fours in his trademark style to heap pressure on an already struggling bowling attack. Faf du Plessis retired hurt on 133 after hitting six sixes and nine fours off 115 balls. Du Plessis, who unleashed big hits despite limping with cramps in his feet, finally converted a knock into three figures after scoring three fifties in the series. Du Plessis, who got two chances on 47 and 86, added 164 with de Villiers before walking off the ground. Du Plessis had earlier played second fiddle to Quinton de Kock during a 154-run second wicket stand. De Kock kept up his fine record against India as he slammed his fifth century against the opposition and eighth overall. De Kock, who was dropped at mid-off by Mohit Sharma off leg-spinner Amit Mishra when on 58, struck 17 fours and a six off 87 deliveries and was out to spinner Suresh Raina, caught at long off while trying to keep up the flow of runs. Opener Hashim Amla, who scored 23 off 13 balls, became the fastest to 6,000 runs in ODIs during his 123rd ODI innings. Virat Kohli was the previous fastest, reaching the mark in his 136th innings. South Africa fell short of the highest ODI total by five runs as they smashed the Indian attack to make 438-4 at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. It was carnage as Quinton de Kock (109), Faf du Plessis (133 retired) and AB de Villiers (119) put the Indian bowlers to the sword posting the highest ever ODI total against the hosts.

Teams India: Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina, MS Dhoni, Axar Patel, Harbhajan Singh, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohit Sharma, Amit Mishra South Africa: Quinton de Kock, David Miller, Hashim Amla, Faf du Plessis, AB de Villiers, Dean Elgar, Farhaan Behardien, Dale Steyn, Kagiso Rabada, Imran Tahir, Kyle Abbott Preview Virat Kohli's return to vintage form has triggered India's resurgence as they lock horns with South Africa in the decisive fifth one-day international at Wankhede stadium in Mumbai on Sunday. Having conceded the T20 series, Dhoni's men have clawed their way back to set up a tantalising series decider after winning in Chennai. India's bowlers backed up a long-awaited century from Virat Kohli as the hosts defeated South Africa by 35 runs on Thursday to level the five-match one-day series 2-2. Kohli smashed 138 off 140 balls to lift India to 299-8 after Mahendra Singh Dhoni elected to bat in the must-win international at the Chidambaram stadium in Chennai. The tourists managed only 264-9 in reply despite a heroic 112 off 107 balls by skipper AB de Villiers even as the other batsmen folded in the stifling heat and humidity. Seamer Bhuvneshwar Kumar claimed three wickets and off-spinner Harbhajan Singh took two to set the stage for the decisive final match at the Wankhede stadium in Mumbai on Sunday.\"The mood is great, especially considering we beat them in Chennai which was a must-win game for us. We hadn't played good cricket collectively, until Chennai. It was important to get a collective performance in. Now, due to the rule changes game awareness is important. We figured what had to be done and we were able to execute it, which is a good thing. All the batsmen are in a very good mental space,\" said Kohli who was personally looking forward to the virtual final.\"This Wankhede pitch should have more carry and bounce. A game like tomorrow's is something that I personally like to be a part of. You want to be performing in big games and winning for the team. That feeling after you make a significant contribution to the team's win is something that, as a sportsman, is hard to replicate in any aspect of life,\" he added. Kohli struck six boundaries and five sixes in his 23rd one-day century, the first after a gap of 13 innings since scoring the match-winning 107 against Pakistan in the World Cup match in Adelaide in February. South Africa badly missed all-rounder JP Duminy and fast bowler Morne Morkel who were ruled out of the key game due to injuries. \"It's been a very exciting and close ODI series. We've managed to win four games out of six and its good for us. Both teams have been competitive and it will be exciting,\" said South African batsman Hashim Amla.
