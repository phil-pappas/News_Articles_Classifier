Join the Conversation Jon Spencer, Reporter 10:56 p.m. EDT October 8, 2015 Some fans are getting nasty on Twitter and message boards, but quarterback Cardale Jones still has the backing of coach Urban Meyer. (Photo: Joe Maiorana/USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nMy two cents — and I’ll even throw in some lint — as Ohio State completes the first half of its regular season: \n• If you thought Cardale Jones’ play has been all over the place, consider coach Urban Meyer’s assessment of his starting quarterback’s performance in the win over Indiana. In Monday’s press conference his descriptions ranged from “not a champion” to “decent” to “awful” (three misfires in a row) to “inexcusable” (his interception) to “one of his better days.” \nThe only positive is that Jones completed nearly 70 percent of his passes. But if you look at the big picture, the Buckeyes had only six points at halftime, he looked indecisive in the pocket when he wasn’t locking on a receiver, has stopped being a running threat and — this obviously isn’t all on him — is at the controls of an offense that is 103rd out of 127 FBS schools in third down conversions and has gone from one of the best red zone attacks to 108th — scoring only six touchdowns on 16 tries inside the 20. \nOne emailer nailed it. If Meyer rewarded Jones with the starting job for coming to the rescue and leading the Buckeyes to the 2014 national championship “that debt has been paid.” \n• I’ve heard everything from Meyer is sticking with Jones because he stubbornly refuses to admit he made a mistake to he’s trying to prove he can adapt his system to the personnel — in this case, his pro-style quarterback. You’ve probably noticed that the read option, a staple of his attack when Braxton Miller and J.T. Barrett were at the controls, has all but disappeared from the gameplan. \nRight now, Jones is on pace to rush for 356 yards over 14 games, which would be the third-lowest total by Meyer’s primary quarterback in his 13-plus years as a head coach. Barrett was flirting with 1,000 before getting hurt against Michigan, leading to Meyer being asked this week if he had considered using Barrett as a red zone specialist the way he used Tim Tebow during Florida’s 2006 national championship run. \n“We’ve thought about it; we’ve had that conversation,” said Meyer, who also admitted that having that running threat at quarterback “cleans up defenses for you.” \n• It’s a flimsy defense, but some have pointed out that Jones had a touchdown pass to Ezekiel Elliott last Saturday negated on an illegal block by Braxton Miller. I never make a big deal about flags erasing TDs because in most cases a score probably wouldn’t have happened without the player committing the infraction. \nWhat Miller’s mistake does point to is a bigger issue: The Buckeyes are tied for second-most penalties in the Big Ten, behind only Maryland. Coupled with 13 turnovers, also second-highest in the league behind Maryland’s 17, it’s naturally going to raise concerns about complacency, lack of focus and lack of discipline. \nMeyer hasn’t detected that. \n“Those things are fixable,” he said. “When you start getting (lack of) effort and attitude ... that’s where red flags start showing up and I don’t feel that at all.” \nThere had better be a quick fix because those flaws will get OSU beat by a lesser team than Michigan State and Michigan. \n• Loyal reader Gib Gildea pointed something out this week that is very interesting. While OSU fans complain about the loss of offensive coordinator Tom Herman, Michigan State fans may feel the same way about their unbeaten Spartans losing defensive coordinator Pat Narduzzi. \nAs head coach at Pittsburgh, Narduzzi’s Panthers are No. 4 in the country in total defense and MSU has fallen from No. 8 last year with him to 64th without him. \nAs the new head coach at Houston, Herman presides over an offense that is No. 4 in the country after ranking 55th last season. The Buckeyes, without Herman, have fallen from No. 9 to 33rd. \nIt’s strange because Meyer’s forte is offense and defense is the calling card of MSU head coach Mark Dantonio, the D coordinator of OSU’s 2002 national championship team. So you wouldn’t think losing their coordinators would make that big an impact. \n• While everyone talks about Jones’ stock dropping with NFL scouts, what about defensive end Joey Bosa? Maybe he’ll still be the first defensive player off the board, but not because of anything he’s done so far in 2015. He has 0.5 sacks more than Elliott, Jones or Barrett. He does have four hurries and has broken up three passes, but hasn’t looked like an All-American yet.
