Various Sikh organisations led by United Akali Dal and SAD (Amritsar) on Monday, gave a call for holding Sarbat Khalsa on November 10 at Gurudwara Manji Sahib in the Golden Temple Complex, during a preparatory meeting held at Ludhiana; the SGPC clearly indicated that Golden Temple complex should be ruled out as venue. SGPC president Avtar Singh Makkar said, “Except Akal Takht, no organisation holds the right to call Sarbat Khalsa on ethical grounds, so it can never be allowed at the Golden Temple complex. A handful of persons want to gain political mileage in the name of religion, this should be discouraged as the conclusion of the highest temporal seat should be honoured,” he said. The factions which have come out against the grant of pardon are Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), Amritsar, headed by Simranjit Singh Mann; SAD (united) led by Mokham Singh; SAD (Pardhani), SAD (Delhi), Dal Khalsa, Damdami Taksal (Ajnala), Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Sant Samaj, Haryana Sikh Gurdwara Committee and the All India Sikh Students Federation. These bodies have been adamant on holding Sarbat Khalsa, however, differences erupted over the venue. While a section wanted it to be held at Amritsar only, but not in the Golden Temple complex, as their apprehensions were that it might not be allowed or get easily disrupted as it could create panic like situation keeping in view the June 6 episode of clash between two groups in the Golden Temple complex. Some wish to conduct it at a venue located outside Amritsar or even overseas. Mohkam Singh said, “We are part and parcel of Sikh Panth and holds fundamental right to raise voice against the Badal-influenced decision taken by the Sikh clergy. Our endeavour was to hold Sarbat Khalsa after taking into confidence the masses from across the globe. If we are not allowed to hold it at the Golden Temple complex, we may consider another venue on the Tarn Taran road,” he said. Meanwhile, SAD (Delhi) chief Paramjit Singh Sarna said Sarbat Khalsa should be held at a place where Badal and other anti-Sikh forces cannot create hindrances. “There should be no constraints to hold it overseas too,” he said. On the other hand, former jathedar of Takht Sri Damdama Sahib Giani Kewal Singh has appealed Sikh bodies to come under the umbrella of Panthic Talmel Sangathan to decide about the structure and policies to be adopted about the proposed Sarbat Khalsa in an ethical manner. “Calling Sarbat Khalsa just for the dera-head issue would be a farce. There are other religious, social and political issues related to Sikh community which need thorough scanning. The Golden Temple venue too may create panic or possibility of clash,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:01:18.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
