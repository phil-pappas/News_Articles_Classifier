The sides traded early efforts on goal in an even opening quarter. The visitors got their noses in front midway through the half. Joshua Mullin swung in a cross and Paul Willis nodded cleverly past Graeme Smith.In the second period, Mullin threatened to extend the lead, while Willie Dyer had a couple of dangerous efforts for Brechin.The win took Albion up to third, as Brechin remained bottom.
