(AP) - A suburban New York man is being held on $20 million bond after police say he fatally beat his girlfriend's infant son.\nLord Pardo pleaded not guilty Tuesday to a murder charge in the death of 17-month-old Mason Robinson. His attorney, Meir Moza, vehemently denied his client killed the child.\nPolice say the 26-year-old factory worker was caring for the toddler on Sunday afternoon at his home in Uniondale when the child was injured.\nHe was taken to a hospital, where authorities found the boy had suffered a lacerated liver and lungs and fractured skull and ribs. Prosecutors said the injuries came from multiple blows.\nPardo's attorney said the child was jumping on a bed when he fell and was injured.\nThis story was corrected to show that incident happened at suspect's home, not girlfriend's apartment.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:25:50.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
