The bad news is that the latest, oh-so-salacious soap opera the former Providence College and Boston Celtics coach is facing could prove to be his downfall. The particulars are as follows: An admitted Louisville prostitute/madam has written a book titled \"Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen.\" The story, written with Pulitzer Prize winner Dick Cady of Indianapolis, claims that former Louisville player and coaching staff member Andre McGee repeatedly hired Katina Powell to provide strippers and prostitutes during campus visits of highly sought-after high school basketball players. The women would be paid in cash and game tickets to perform for recruits, and in some cases their fathers, as well as then-current Louisville players. The book names players involved and contains pictures of Powell and other women — including her three teenage daughters — with Cardinals players. Most of the escapades reportedly played out at Minardi Hall, a campus dormitory named after Pitino's brother-in-law who was killed in the 9/11 attacks. Pitino, to no one's surprise, has denied knowledge of the trysts. This may sound naïve, but I believe Pitino. No head coach with a pulse, especially one who has made it to basketball's mountaintop, would bless such a tawdry process. But in the new NCAA, the head coach's fingertips don't have to be the ones that typed the text messages that lined up trysts with call girls. As Syracuse's Jim Boeheim and SMU's Larry Brown have learned (with North Carolina's Roy Williams likely on deck), the NCAA now is penalizing head coaches with a \"failure-to-monitor charge\" when a staff member is found to have broken rules. McGee, who is now at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, hasn't spoken on the subject. Neither has Celtics rookie Terry Rozier, one of the ex-Louisville players mentioned as a potential client in the book. Louisville is cooperating with the NCAA, and Pitino says he knows \"very little\" about the whole ordeal and isn't yet able to deny the claims. Even so, after watching the 63-year-old meet with the press twice over the weekend, it is clear this book will be the talk of Louisville over the next several months. \"I'll never look at that,\" Pitino said of the book. \"The name of that book was motive for money. I'm not going to sink to that level. The truth — we will find the truth. If we did something wrong, we're going to own up to it. We're going to be truthful to the NCAA.\" Pitino went on to defend his program. He said pictures of his players with young women don't implicate anyone. After all, his Cardinals mirror the fame of the New England Patriots in our state and are asked to take \"selfies\" several times a day by female fans. He says he's looking forward to \"the truth\" surfacing in the coming weeks. Page 2 of 3 - \"I base things on the truth. I always say, there is an old saying: 'The truth will set you free.' You're hearing one side of the story. We're going to hear a different side of the story when the truth comes out,\" he said. Powell's publisher, IBJ Book Publishing, is co-owned by one of Indiana University's biggest athletic boosters. To say that the Hoosiers and the Cardinals don't like each other is an understatement, but now the claims in the book will be vetted to some extent by the U of L and the NCAA, and a version of the truth will surface. If McGee's involvement is proven and traced back to the coaching staff, Pitino will be the big fish in deep trouble and the Cards' 2013 national championship could become an issue. Powell isn't hiding her reasons for keeping a journal with what she claims are records of her clients' names, text messages with McGee and other evidence. She also doesn't hide that she's out to make money. The publisher did not pay her a book advance, but she will be paid 10 percent of its gross sales. Asked if she's concerned that she could be sued for making false claims, Powell didn't flinch. \"For the truth?\" she said. \"If you can get sued for the truth, hey, [McGee] can get every penny out of me. But it's the truth, and I've never known a person to be sued for the truth.\" Recruiting coups Among the early surprise winners on the recruiting scene this fall are the UMass Minutemen. Derek Kellogg's star has faded of late, but he's showing he has no plans to limp out of town after landing the Atlantic 10's top early recruit in New Orleans guard DeJon Jarreau, his teammate Brison Gresham, burly big man Chris Baldwin and uber-athlete Unique McLean. Jarreau is a top 50-level player. So is Wakefield, Mass., guard Bruce Brown, who has UMass in his final four schools. Along with UMass, the Rhody Rams are the other early recruiting winners in the A-10. URI has four verbals and will fill some major holes up front when a trio of big men enroll next fall: Mike Layssard (6-foot-9), Michael Tertsea (6-9) and Cyril Langevine (6-8). New England's best class so far is at Connecticut, which keeps adding top 50-level players in New York's Mamadou Diarra (6-8), Tampa's Juwan Durham (6-9) and Atlanta-area guard Alterique Gilbert. Less 'Madness' A few years ago, the NCAA did away with the \"Midnight Madness\" kickoff to the college basketball season. Full practices actually tipped off over the weekend. Schools still schedule smoke-and-mirror shows over the next few weekends with rap stars and student groups taking center stage. Providence is spending nice coin for an Oct. 17 show featuring Grammy award winner Ludacris. Villanova has rolled out 50 Cent, Drake and Nicki Minaj in recent years. Page 3 of 3 - Finally, the best ticket deal around is at URI, where the Rams are offering a five-game Flex Package that includes the Providence game, Richmond, a choice of either Dayton or UMass, and any two additional games. Seats in that mini-plan begin at $65.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:45:51.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
