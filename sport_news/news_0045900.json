But he said it's not an outright loss. \nHuma and Colter have renewed their fight to get NCAA, school and conference officials to abide by stronger concussion protocols, provide long-term health care and make sure recent changes involving stipends and multi-year scholarships become legally binding. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:19:36.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
