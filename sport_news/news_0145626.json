Johnson said he’s “definitely” going to play Sunday against the New Orleans Saints after suffering an MCL sprain and sprained ankle last Sunday against Washington.\nThe status of Barbre (undisclosed injury) and Peters (quadriceps) isn’t known. Johnson said he was hurt while blocking on an extra point in the third quarter. At first, he said he thought he tore his ACL. But Johnson returned to the game on the Eagles’ next series.\n“I felt a pop,” Johnson said. “I was scared because usually if I’m on the ground – and punching the ground, I thought I was done, to be honest. Fortunately, it wasn’t too bad.”\nEagles tackle Lane Johnson (65) is tended to by trainers on the field during the second half against the Washington Redskins on Sunday. (Photo: Patrick Semansky/AP)\nThe larger issue, of course, is how the line, which was already struggling, can get the continuity necessary with players shuffling in and out of the lineup with injuries. During practice Tuesday, for example, Newark High School star Malcolm Bunche was with the first team at right tackle.\nMatt Tobin started the game against Washington at right guard, replacing Andrew Gardner, who’s out for the season after suffering a Lisfranc sprain. But Tobin moved to left tackle when Peters left with his quadriceps injury at the end of the first quarter. Then Dennis Kelly came in at right guard.\n“We’ve got a bunch of new guys in there,” Johnson said. “I haven’t really played that much with Kelly or Tobin. When I get back into practice, I’ll start getting some reps with them. That’s probably the biggest deal, just getting into a rhythm with them.”\nTobin, meanwhile, spent all last week preparing at right guard after moving to backup left tackle in training camp once Gardner had won the starting right guard job. This week, he’s preparing for both, unsure if Peters will be able to play.\n“You have to know who you’re playing next to – and what they’re thinking,” Tobin said.\nDELAWAREONLINE\nAs a kicker, David Akers knows Caleb Sturgis' struggles\nDELAWAREONLINE\nKelly: Blame execution, not scheme for Eagles' problems\nCenter Jason Kelce is the only healthy starting offensive lineman from the start of the season. He said the cohesion isn’t the issue as much as the players themselves.\n“[The injuries] make it harder for the offensive line,” he said. “But I think most of the mistakes that are coming in the game aren’t coming because of continuity issues or chemistry issues. It’s just guys not doing their job. I don’t really think that has much to do with guys being in and out. For the most part, the guys who went in … they played pretty solid games, for the most part.\n“I think this is something that can get corrected, that will get corrected. By no means is this the end of a season type of deal, which is what it’s being portrayed out to be.”\nLack of sacks Eagles defensive coordinator Bill Davis said the Eagles had more pressure on Washington quarterback Kirk Cousins than it seemed with only one sack in 46 pass attempts.\n“When you face teams like we just did where the ball is out lightning quick, you always say, ‘Well, the rush isn’t getting there,’” Davis said. “On the [throws] where he’s holding [the ball] long, if we’re not pressuring him, then we are in trouble. We had him in our hands probably three times that we did not sack him, and that’s frustrating.”\nDELAWAREONLINE\nKelly has confidence in his kicker, sort of\nThe Eagles have six sacks this season. Only five teams have fewer.\n“The sack numbers aren’t where you’d like them,” Davis said. “[The pressure] has to increase. But we actually aren’t horrible right there. The sack numbers are.”\nLittle clarity on injuries In addition to the three offensive linemen, inside linebacker Mychal Kendricks (hamstring), cornerback Byron Maxwell (quad), defensive end Brandon Bair (groin) and inside linebacker Kiko Alonso (knee) also sat out practice.\nMaxwell said afterward that he can’t really run, but hopes to be back in time for the game Sunday. Davis said defensive ends Cedric Thornton (hand) and Taylor Hart (shoulder) could return this Sunday after missing the previous two games. Davis said Kendricks and Maxwell are “day-to-day,” and that he thinks Bair might miss a game or two.\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com .
