White slideshow KENNESAW — After scoring five runs in the top of the seventh to stun Cherokee in Wednesday’s Game 2, Harrison’s offense continued to roll in a 5-1 win Thursday to clinch the second-round Class state playoff series at Clackum Field.The Lady Hoyas lost Wednesday’s first game 1-0 and trailed 4-3 in the top of the seventh of the nightcap, but they rallied to earn an 8-5 victory and force Thursday’s elimination game.Harrison carried its momentum over into the early innings of Game 3, scoring a clutch two-out run in the first inning and three more in the second to build a 4-0 margin.Cherokee had at least one hit in every inning, but it delivered its only run in the top of the fifth as Harrison pitchers Emily Kachel and Pierce Fox, along with the Lady Hoyas’ defense, kept the Lady Warriors at bay.Harrison (25-6) moved on to the elite eight in Columbus for the fourth year in a row, while Cherokee (27-7) saw its season come to an end short of the state finals for the seventh straight season.“We came out tight and they jumped on us, which made us press even more,” Cherokee coach Tonya Carlisle said. “Harrison’s a good team. They have the experience and they’ve been in this position before. They had ice in their veins to come back the way they did (Wednesday) and get on us early (Thursday). That experience made the difference.“But I’m proud to death of my team. They won 27 games and put Cherokee back on the map a little bit. I love them. We had a great season, and they don’t have anything to hang their heads about.”Jaiden Fields put Harrison on the board in the first when her a two-out single scored Maddie Davenport.Lindley Bruce led off the second with a home run — her third of the season — and after Gabby Malafronte walked and Summer Swanson reached on a throwing error, Davenport laced a two-out double to right center to plate Malafronte and Swanson for a 4-0 lead.“It was important for us to get those runs early and continue to establish the momentum we built from Game 2, scoring late, into scoring early this game,” Harrison coach Matt Jones said. “That helped our pitchers settle down and our defense to stay loose and focused.”Cherokee was able to get on base throughout the game, totaling nine hits and two for extra bases, but it was unable to bring in runs. The Lady Warriors stranded runners in scoring position in the first, second, fourth, sixth and seventh innings.Cherokee finally broke through in the fifth. Macy Martinez walked and scored on Autumn Bible’s one-out double. Alise Hooks singled and moved to second on the throw, putting Bible on third.Taylor Cates then ground out to Fox, who relieved Kachel, and Fox pitched the ball to catcher Abby Broome, who tagged out Bible at home for the second out of the inning. A strikeout then ended the threat.Rachel Catt and Analise Gilbert, who-pitch ran for Schylar Harris following her single, were left stranded in scoring position in the sixth.Hooks and courtesy runner Madison Stoner, who was in for Kindell Reeves following her single, were left on base in the seventh.Martinez was 2-for-3 with a run scored, while Bible batted 1-for-4 with an RBI double. Cates finished 2-for-4 with a stolen base. Reeves batted 2-for-4, Catt was 1-for-3 with a double and Hooks and Harris each went 1-for-3.Reeves allowed five runs — four earned — on six hits with one walk and four strikeouts.Abby Broome’s two-run home run in the sixth inning capped Harrison’s scoring.
