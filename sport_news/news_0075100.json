The Hawks provided Ithaca with a rare scoreless first half – setting the stage for Cornell-Roberts’ big second half. “I thought we played organized, patient and disciplined soccer in the first half,” Corning head coach Steve Mastronardi said. “We tried to keep them off the scoreboard as long as we could.” Doing the yeoman’s work to keep Ithaca off the board over the first 40 minutes of play was Corning keeper Erik Ekstrom – who stopped eight shots on the night. “Our goalkeeper was great again,” Mastronardi said. But five minutes into the second half of play – Ithaca found its offensive teeth as Cornell-Roberts broke the scoreless tie. It was just 1:15 later when he struck for his second goal. Ithaca’s third goal was scored off a Hawks player – before Cornell-Roberts scored for the final time, with 3:51 left in the game. The final goal was assisted by Andrew Araneo. For the game, Ithaca out-shot Corning 21-2. By The Leader staff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:14:48.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
