The Patriots totaled 17 points while West Milford and Pompton Lakes followed with 13 and 12, respectively. \n\"We were the underdogs … no one thought we were going to win,\" Wayne Hills junior Jess Goldman said. \n\"People were coming up to us saying, ‘I have no idea how you did it.’ \" \nWayne Hills accomplished the feat by winning three of the five individual crowns, including Goldman’s victory at first singles. \nPassaic County’s new singles queen topped West Milford’s Tess Korinko,7-5, 6-0. \n\"I was so nervous … I was freaking out the entire day,\" Goldman said. \n\"The finals were supposed to be Friday. Then they weren’t, so I was like, ‘Oh my God! I’m going to be freaking out the entire weekend.’ \n\"I was really nervous for the first set but after that, it disappeared. I was like, ‘Jessica … you want this’ and I pulled myself together.\" \nOne court over, Goldman’s classmate Katarina Kolarski captured the second-singles title by beating West Milford’s Theresa Fernbacher, 7-5, 6-4. \nWayne Hills’ third win came at second doubles, where seniors Hima Tallam and Yagamurthy bested Pompton Lakes’ Lauren Sanford and Charla Lim, 6-4, 6-3. \nTallam and Yagamurthy played tennis as underclassmen but sat out last season to concentrate on their SATs and advanced placement courses. \nThey both said they were happy with their test scores and happier to return to the court this fall. \n\"We wanted to play so badly last year, but we just couldn’t,\" Tallam said. \n\"We still played all the time but not with the team. I feel like winning this was our big comeback.\" \nWhile Wayne Hills was wrapping up another team trophy, Pompton Lakes also finished off a strong tournament by taking a pair of titles. \nJunior Charlotte Yates captured the third singles trophy, knocking off Wayne Hills’ Maddy Flynn, 7-5, 6-0. \nCardinal seniors Kelly Brennan and Clarissa Abella finished the proceedings by outlasting West Milford’s Abby Johnson and Allison Borrelli in second doubles, 6-2, 2-6, 6-4. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:22:43.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
