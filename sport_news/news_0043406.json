They also planned to appear in Piscataway municipal court later Tuesday in an attempt to get simple assault charges against Carroo dropped. \nCarroo was accused of attacking the woman after a football game last month and slamming her onto concrete. The woman, who once dated Carroo, received injuries on her hip, hands, elbow and head. \nCarroo was suspended from the team after the assault charge was filed. His lawyer, Peter Gilbreth, has said he plans to petition the school to lift the suspension so Carroo can return to the playing field. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:37:14.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
