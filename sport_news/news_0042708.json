Wade Spees/Staff/File × When all the equipment had finally been put away and the exit interviews completed, South Carolina Stingrays veteran forward Patrick Gaul still couldn’t believe the season was over. \nComing Up \nWHAT: Season opener vs. Reading Royals \nWHEN: Oct. 17, 7:05 p.m. \nWHERE: North Charleston Coliseum \nTICKETS: (843) 744-2248 or go to stingrayshockey.com It had been an arduous nine-month journey for Gaul and his teammates that ended with a Game 7 loss to the Allen Americans in the Kelly Cup finals last June. The Stingrays were one win away from claiming an ECHL-record fourth Kelly Cup title. The disappoint still lingers for the players, but Gaul said getting back on the ice this week for preseason practices at the Carolina Ice Palace has been cathartic. “We had such a great season it was hard to kind of focus on all the good things we’d done, all the records we’d set, after losing Game 7 like we did,” Gaul said. “Overall, I think last season was a huge success, but it took a little while for me to get past what happened in Game 7. The toughest part was knowing what it took to get to that point and then coming up just short of your ultimate goal, but that’s in the past and it’s a new season now and I’m ready to go.” The Stingrays play the Atlanta Gladiators on Friday at 7:05 p.m. in the first of two preseason games this weekend at the Carolina Ice Palace. South Carolina will face Greenville Saturday at 7 p.m. Both games are open only to season ticket holders. The Stingrays open the season Oct. 17 at the North Charleston Coliseum against the Reading Royals. Joe Devin, who had two game-winning overtime goals during the playoffs, including a goal in triple overtime against Toledo that sent the Stingrays to the Kelly Cup finals, said time was the only cure for the heartache of the Game 7 loss. “We had such an believable group of guys,” Devin said. “Everyone was really close and that’s what made losing Game 7 so painful. It probably wasn’t until the start of August when we started talking about coming back that I was finally able to put Game 7 behind me and look ahead to the new season. I’m back in South Carolina and I’m excited to be back on the ice. I can’t wait for the season to start.” Besides Gaul and Devin, only defensemen Wade Epp and Marcus Perrier played in the Stingrays’ Kelly Cup playoff run last season. Forward Brett Cameron and defenseman Brendan Ellis, who missed last season with an injury, also return, but were not on the Stingrays’ playoff roster. While several players from last season’s team signed with clubs in Europe, others are still fighting for a spot on American Hockey League rosters like captain Andrew Rowe (Bridgeport) and linemmates Wayne Simpson (Portland) and Derek DeBlois (Lake Erie). Rowe, Simpson and DeBlois were the top three scorers during the Kelly Cup playoffs. “To be honest I don’t think there’s any momentum that carries over from one season to the next,” said Stingrays head coach Spencer Carbery. “It’s a new season and a new team. Even if you have a ton of guys back from the previous year, every team is different. There’s so much turnover in this league that it’s almost impossible to carry over any momentum from what happened the year before.” The Stingrays are adding goalie Vitek Vanecek and forward Austin Fyten to their training camp roster. Both were assigned by the Hershey Bears, the Stingrays’ AHL affiliate, on Thursday. Fyten spent all of last season with the Lehigh Valley Phantoms of the AHL, scoring 11 points (two goals, nine assists) in 64 games. He has appeared in 61 career ECHL games, all with the Idaho Steelheads. During the 2012-2013 season, Fyten recorded 41 points (14 goals, 27 assists) in 46 games with the Steelheads. He has also appeared in 122 AHL games, scoring 33 points. Vanecek was a second-round pick of the Washington Capitals in 2014.
