The duo were among five seniors including fellow co-captain Jordan Scruggs and libero Cara Rhoad. \nJunior Katie Stanton, who joined Richard and Moore on this year’s All-Area 4- team, led Northgate with 10 kills. Richard posted 8 kills and shared 12 digs with Rhoad while combining to lead the defensive effort. \nBoth Richard and Moore will play in the upcoming Georgia Volleyball Coaches Association All-Star Game on Nov. 7. \nAt Etowah, East Coweta led set two 14-10 in one of its best runs of the match while led by its senior trio in a much younger lineup than last year’s Elite 8 appearance. \nAlong with junior libero Riley Padgett, the Lady Indians entered with a roster made up with eight freshmen and sophomores, four of which made key contributions in Tuesday’s 3-1 second-round playoff victory at home over North Gwinnett. \n“It’s very hard to be upset, though there’s so much disappointment for my seniors because I know they wanted to be back in the Final Four. But what they did was prepare this team for what’s expected of East Coweta volleyball and that’s expect to fight and expect to win,” said Lady Indians head coach Amber \nMcClure. “Those senior girls never quit. They refused to be told this was a rebuilding year.” \nIngram posted 12 kills and four blocks in her final match for East Coweta as a standout middle hitter. From the outside, Winters came through with seven kills, while Smith had a team-high 22 assists at setter. \n“They’re a very fast team, extremely quick,” McClure said of Etowah. “As we have all season, we has some spots in our rotation that gave us trouble. There were times when we got in too deep of a hole.” \nThe future remains bright, however, considering East Coweta should bring back 10-plus returners next year. They include right-side hitter, sophomore Kirby Olive, who had five kills in the loss. \n“She plays the [opposite] side, but I think this year she really learned that she has one of the biggest roles \non the team,” McClure said. “This year we had so many more challenges, but these girls fought so hard together. The seniors did so much to bring the team together.” \nPadgett finished with a team-high 14 digs and will be part of next year’s senior class. Sophomore Allie Edwards, who had two aces, joins freshmen Becca Sieckmann, Isabel Moller and Nahla Muhammad among players that will return with GHSA state tournament experience. \nThe future is equally bright for Northgate, which had junior Morgan Marshall and freshman Emily Dozier posting 13 and 7 assists, respectively in Saturday’s Elite 8 match. \nMarshall and junior middle hitter Kia Thomas were both named All-Area 4- honorable mention this year. Sophomore Delaney Surapine is also among 10 underclassmen expected back next season.
