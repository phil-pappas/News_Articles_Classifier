There was no comparable window in 2013. Compared to previous editions of the rivalry, overnights increased 15% from last year (3.3) and a tick from 2013 (3.7). \nThe Longhorns’ upset win earned the highest overnight for the ‘Red River Rivalry’ since 2011 (4.5), but the fifth-lowest since at least 2000. It also scored the top college football overnight on any network over the weekend, topping a second-place 3.1 for Georgia/Tennessee on CBS. \nIn other action, the Miami/Florida State Saturday Night Football game drew a 2.7 overnight — up 17% from Michigan State/Nebraska last year (2.3) and down 44% from Ohio State/Northwestern in 2013 (4.8). The 2.7 is tied as the second-lowest of the season for ABC’s primetime package, matching Stanford/USC in week three and ahead of only UCLA/Arizona in week four. \nDespite the soft performance, FSU’s win topped competing coverage of Arkansas/Alabama on ESPN (2.5) to rank as the night’s top game. \nThe middle part of ABC’s tripleheader, regional action featuring Georgia Tech/Clemson, drew a 2.2 overnight — down a tick from last year (2.3) and down 21% from 2013 (2.8), both of which were also regional windows.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:36:52.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
