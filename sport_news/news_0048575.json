LOUIS — The immovable object in baseball right now, until proven otherwise, is Chicago Cubs starter Jake Arrieta. The St. Louis Cardinals will face him next in a National League division series that may have turned Saturday on a barrage of blunders, bunts, bleeders and a blast. The Cubs evened the best-of-five series in Game 2 at Busch Stadium, stealing a 6-3 victory when the Cardinals and their starter, Jaime Garcia, fell apart in a ghastly second inning. Two errors, two bunts, two singles and Jorge Soler’s home run gave a jolt to the Cubs, who were shut out in the opener, 4-0, on Friday. Arrieta, who blanked the Pittsburgh Pirates in Wednesday’s wild-card game, will throw the next pitch in this series as the Game 3 starter at Wrigley Field on Monday. Arrieta is 14-1 with a 0.72 E.R.A. since the All-Star break, a run for the ages that will take the Cubs to the verge of the National League Championship Series with another victory on Monday. OCT. 10, 2015 The Cardinals — who have played in the N.L.C.S. nine times since 2000 — leaned on John Lackey in Game 1 and turned confidently to Garcia on Saturday. After missing much of the last three seasons, Garcia was healthy and productive in 20 starts this year (10-6 with a 2.43 earned run average), and somehow did not face the Cubs.

That made him unfamiliar, which typically helps a pitcher. But Joe Maddon, the Cubs’ manager, was ready. He sat his left-handed-hitting outfielders, Chris Coghlan and Kyle Schwarber, and started two who bat right-handed, Austin Jackson and Jorge Soler. Asked if he had considered using the slugging Schwarber anyway, given his recent success, the normally talkative Maddon replied, simply: “No.” He had more to say when asked if Cubs fans and players should worry after losing the opener. “The fan should always worry,” Maddon said. “It’s always the prerogative of a fan to worry, I absolutely believe that. That’s what barrooms are for. That’s what little forums are for online in this 21st- century stuff. Go ahead and worry as much as you’d like. “From our perspective, we have to just go out and play the game like we always do. I’m here to tell you, man, I just can’t live that way. I don’t vibrate at that frequency.” Maybe not, but when the Cardinals’ Matt Carpenter belted a leadoff homer to the center field berm in the bottom of the first, the frequency pulsated, at high volume, from delirious fans in red. Garcia had fanned the Cubs’ dangerous 3-4 hitters, Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo, after Soler’s double in the first. Now he had a lead. Almost immediately, Garcia gave it right back. He served up five runs in the second inning, and while all were unearned, that was a quirk of the stat sheet — the pitcher and his defense both came unglued. After Starlin Castro’s leadoff single, second baseman Kolten Wong lost his grip while trying to turn a double play. His wild throw brought the hitter, Jackson, to second base, and from there he stole third easily. A walk to Miguel Montero brought up pitcher Kyle Hendricks — batting eighth, a Maddon specialty — with one out. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:55:08.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
