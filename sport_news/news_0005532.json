Busch held on for second to give JGR their fourth sweep of the top two positions this season. \nJoey Logano qualified third, followed by Greg Biffle and Denny Hamlin. \nKenseth’s pole-winning effort was the 17th of his career and his second straight at Charlotte, after winning the pole for the Coca-Cola 600 in May. \n“It was a heck of a lap and I knew it had a lot of speed,” said Kenseth. “Changed up (turns) one and two a little bit – I just got a little tight in the middle of three and four trying for it. I knew it was pretty fast. It was a lot of fun to drive today. We only did qualifying, we have 500 miles on Saturday, but it was a lot of fun today.” \nKenseth currently leads the Chase standings by virtue of his five victories this season, including a win in the second race of the opening Challenger round which earned him an automatic bid into the second round. Now, he’s hungry for a victory at Charlotte to punch his ticket into the next round and avoid any possible calamity in the final Contender Round race at Talladega. \n“We can’t really rest on what we had four of five weeks ago, we have to keep making these things better to try to run with the best guys down the stretch,” said Kenseth. “They’ve been doing that and we obviously have some speed, we just need to get it driving good tomorrow for Saturday.” \nBusch’s outside pole is his first front row start since Bristol where he started alongside teammate Denny Hamlin and his fourth at Charlotte, a track that has been his nemesis in recent years with no Cup wins in 23 starts. \nAlthough Busch and his JGR teammate have made their mark in qualifying in the last three weeks, Busch reiterated that just qualifying good is not enough. \n“Qualifying is not a statement, the race is more of a statement. You have to have a good race, put it all together,” said Busch. “You have to have fast race cars, good engines and good guys on pit road that give you fast pit stops. Putting it all together is certainly what the 4 (Kevin Harvick) bunch did last week and they proved that they’re obviously a championship contender. \n“I’ve been close here before, led a lot of laps and I finished second, finished third I don’t know how many times. I just have to break through for that victory and hoping it can come here on Saturday and that would propel us almost all the way to Homestead. We still have to race Martinsville, Texas and Phoenix, but I’m pretty sure we can get through the next round if we can get through this round.” \nAmong the other Chase contenders in the top 10 are Kurt Busch in sixth, Carl Edwards in eighth and Ryan Newman is in tenth, followed by defending series champion Kevin Harvick, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and Brad Keselowski. Martin Truex, Jr. will start 15th while Jeff Gordon will roll off in 22nd. \nWDUN will have live PRN Radio coverage of Saturday night's NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Bank of America 500 from Charlotte Motor Speedway beginning at 6 pm on 102.9 FM and 550 AM. \nNASCAR Sprint Cup Series Charlotte Motor Speedway – Concord, NC Bank of America 500 – October 8, 2015 \nThursday’s Qualifying Results \n1.
