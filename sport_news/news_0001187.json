Former-Ismaili hitman John Antwi is already available.\nBut Amr Gamal has been omitted for technical reasons by the Ahly management – despite coming on as a second-half substitute late against Geish.\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:38:33.660+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
