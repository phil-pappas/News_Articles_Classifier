Race officials allowed only two qualifying rounds Sunday as conditions worsened in a session that had been delayed from Saturday.\nHamilton can clinch his second consecutive world championship and third overall if he outscores Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel by nine points and Rosberg by two. Rosberg started on the pole here last year before Hamilton won.\nFormula One was forced to use its first Sunday qualifying since 2013 and fourth overall since 2004. Rain was still falling when the drivers took the track.\nHamilton called the wet conditions \"quite fun.\" Race officials expect better conditions as rain chances are forecast to decrease Sunday afternoon.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
