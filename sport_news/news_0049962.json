The Ulster wing was quickly jettisoned after slipping off Jonny May to allow his England counterpart to score at Twickenham in Ireland's 21-13 warm-up defeat. \nNow the 31-year-old is right back in the mix. Bowe would be unlikely to start were Rob Kearney and Payne both fit, but Schmidt's decision to elevate him past replacement Luke Fitzgerald certainly indicates restored faith.
