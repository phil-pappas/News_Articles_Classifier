The talent pipeline goes straight from NCAA college programs to the league, and it very seldom deviates from that path.\nIn the future, though, it might take a detour through Brooklyn.\nThe Fall Experimental Football League, which is currently in the midst of its second season—a total of six games, half of which are played at Coney Island’s MCU Park—isn’t trying to replace college football. It could, however, supplement player development while providing the NFL with a new arena to train officials and experiment with new rules.\nCurrently, the NFL is finding less common ground with the NCAA because collegiate teams are implementing an array of oversimplified offenses that don’t exist at the professional level. This schism is particularly wide for quarterbacks, only seven of which were taken in the 2015 NFL Draft, the fewest since 1955.\n“The college game isn’t preparing pro quarterbacks,” said NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young. “The college game is getting further away from what the pro game is because of…the simplicity.”\nAccording to Young, who played in the United States Football League before catching on with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and San Francisco 49ers, there is talent in professional football beyond the NFL. “Honestly, the football I played with the L.A. Express was better than the football I played in Tampa Bay,” he said.\nBut without lower leagues like the defunct USFL and NFL Europe, much of that talent is going underdeveloped. Even in the NFL, backups are losing reps because practice time has been reduced under the terms of the league’s collective-bargaining agreement.\nThat’s why FXFL commissioner Brian Woods says he has had informal meetings with the 32-team NFL, which he hopes will ultimately become affiliated with his three-team outfit. The NFL declined requests to comment.\nEven without a formal partnership, the FXFL has already cultivated a symbiotic relationship with its bigger brother in its first two years. Around 95% of its players arrived for the season in September after being cut from NFL training-camp rosters. Since the FXFL season ends in November, after the NFL’s trade deadline, players have the chance to catch on with an injury-ravaged NFL roster. And unlike in the Canadian Football League, where players sign one-year deals with a team option for a second season, FXFL players are free to leave for the NFL whenever they want.\nMoreover, other professional leagues, like the CFL and the Arena Football League, operate under drastically different rules, making them ill-equipped to help the NFL or its aspirants.\n“Those other leagues, they’re not looking to develop you to pass you on,” said Bolts offensive lineman Stephen Goodin, who was previously on the Giants’ active roster and has since signed briefly with the Cowboys and Vikings. “It’s for themselves. It’s a big difference. That’s why I wanted to come here.”\nThe FXFL has yet to produce an NFL star. But following last year’s inaugural season, nearly 30% of its players found their way to NFL teams, typically on a futures contract.\n“That place-kicker of ours went all the way down to the final decision with the Redskins,” said Brooklyn Bolts coach Terry Shea, after watching Ty Long hit a 48-yard field goal at practice. “This punter [Cody Webster] had a great training camp with [the Pittsburgh Steelers].”\nThe players’ compensation is at most $1,000 a game. But aside from meals and housing—the entire Bolts roster lives in a Brooklyn hotel—the real currency of the league is game tape.\nThat is what made the Bolts’ rain-soaked, 29-6 season-opening loss to the Florida Blacktips so disappointing. “There were gusts up to 40 mph,” Long said. “It was crazy.”\nThe few fans who stuck around to watch witnessed something that just barely resembled football. Bolts quarterback Josh Freeman, a former NFL first-round pick, fumbled five times while completing just nine of 16 attempts for 32 yards. Whereas the NFL prides itself on playing through just about any weather calamity, the FXFL is useless if it can’t provide its players ideal performance conditions. Shea and Woods agreed that the game should have been postponed.\n“It was a horrendous environment, so we pushed that game out the window, because that tape isn’t gonna show much of anything,” said Shea, a longtime NFL quarterbacks coach and former head coach at Rutgers.\nPlayers aren’t the only thing the FXFL believes it can help the NFL develop. It also wants to serve as a incubator for referees and changes to the rule book.\nIn its inaugural season, the FXFL moved the extra point to the 17-yard line in an effort to make the kick more challenging. This year, the NFL followed suit, pushing its kick back to the 15-yard line.\nThe FXFL also thinks offensive linemen shouldn’t be allowed to block defenders below the knee at the line of scrimmage, the sort of rule that could aid the NFL in its effort to make the game safer.\nLongtime Jets special-teams coordinator Mike Westhoff helped with many of the finer points in the FXFL’s rule book. “Every defensive lineman in the National Football League would take me out to dinner for the rest of my life if they knew I could get this passed in the National Football League,” he said.\nIn other ways, the FXFL is encouraging the NFL to rethink its tactics for making the league safer. Before the 2011 season, the NFL moved its kickoffs from the 30-yard line up to 35 in an effort to reduce returns and the collisions that often ensue. However, more touchbacks has meant fewer balls in the hands of NFL kick returners—some of the league’s most exciting players.\nThe FXFL tries to encourage kick returns without risking player safety. The ball is kicked off from the 25-yard line, and the return team is required to place a minimum of eight players between its own 35- and 45-yard line.\n“This all but eliminates the possibility of a touchback because you’re asking the kicker to kick the ball 85-plus yards,” Woods said. “And by putting [the receiving team’s players] closer together at the point of attack, you have now reduced the chances of a high-impact collision.”\nOf course, none of this will matter if the FXFL goes the way of so many other pro leagues. Like many young businesses, the league lost money in its first season. To help offset costs this season, it folded the Ohio-based Mahoning Valley Brawlers, leaving the league with just two home stadiums (the Florida Blacktips don’t play any home games). It helps that the Bolts and Fort are joined with minor-league baseball teams, which can handle ticketing and merchandise.\n“They’re not looking for a gigantic crowd,” Westhoff said, “just a decent crowd.”\nAccording to Woods, the FXFL relies heavily on local and national sponsorships in addition to subscription fees from any NFL team that wants to scout the league’s game film.\n“[Woods’s] vision was to show people that we could function for several years and play a high brand of football, play consistently, and that maybe the NFL would embrace it,” said Shea, who avoids offensive trickery in an effort to provide his players with useful game film for NFL scouts.\nThat chance at an NFL career, which is increasingly difficult to find, is why the FXFL exists.\n“You’re out there practicing, you’re in pads, you’re learning how to be coached,” Westhoff said of FXFL players. “And you’re getting better and keeping yourself alive. You’re giving yourself a chance.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://online.wsj.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:47:50.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
