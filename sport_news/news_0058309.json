The companies employees aren’t allowed to bet on their own sites but until recently could play on competing sites. DraftKings said the investigation led by the former U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts now with firm Greenberg Taurig confirmed its earlier internal review.

WADA President Craig Reedie told The Associated Press the issue will be discussed at the agency’s executive committee and foundation board meeting from Nov. 17-18 in Colorado Springs.

Soccer Germany not forgotten in FIFA investigation FRANKFURT, Germany – German prosecutors are examining whether there are grounds to open an investigation into allegations that German bidders used a slush fund to help secure the 2006 World Cup. Nadja Niesen, a spokeswoman for Frankfurt prosecutors, said fraud, breach of trust or corruption were possible offenses that might be investigated, news agency dpa reported Monday. Niesen couldn’t say when the examination of whether there is a case will be concluded. German weekly Der Spiegel reported Friday that a slush fund of 10.3 million Swiss francs (about $6 million at that time) was set up to buy the votes of four Asian representatives on the FIFA executive committee.
