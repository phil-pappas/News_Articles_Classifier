United's new stadium is planned. \nCity officials announced Thursday that they filed for eminent domain to acquire control of the Buzzard Point site in preparation for construction. \nThe soccer-only stadium will be located at the industrial site about a mile away from Nationals Park. District leaders had already approved spending $140 million to acquire the land for the site and giving another $40 million in tax breaks. The team will spend $150 million to build the stadium itself. The Major League Soccer team currently plays at RFK Stadium. \nEminent domain means the government can take control of private property for public use, paying compensation to the owner. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T18:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:03:47.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
