He wrapped up the opening set after just 26 minutes with three service breaks.\nThe second set was much tighter, Wawrinka had to fight off two break points in the third game but he seized his only opportunity, in the 10th game, to complete a straight-sets win.\nThe win gave Wawrinka his 11th career title, the majority of which have come since he won the 2014 Australian Open. His win in Japan was the 30-year-old's fourth this year after he won in Chennai and Rotterdam and at the French Open.\nPaire was appearing in just his fourth ATP career final and his second this year after winning the Swedish Open in July.\nThe Frenchman, who played Sunday's final with his left ankle heavily strapped, upset Japan's Kei Nishikori in the semi-finals but was no match for Wawrinka.\n(Reporting by Julian Linden in Singapore; editing )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T11:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:19:39.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
