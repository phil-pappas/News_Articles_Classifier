Recently I was going through my extensive quantity of old and mostly unread e-mails that keeps replenishing itself on an almost supernatural basis when I noticed one from an old friend who calls Maine his home. I had somehow managed to overlook it the first time. Of course I immediately realized there would be something either funny or silly inside, mainly because people who call Maine their home usually get tangled in lots of either funny or silly situations. So naturally I quickly opened it. And I was not disappointed. It seems that last year, my friend, whom I will call “Randy” to protect his real identity from any possible embarrassment, was out scouting a new area for his bow-hunting activities. He is an avid deer hunter. And when he finally was able to bust through what he euphemistically calls “pucker-brush” (no, I will not explain that term any better), he found himself on an old logging road. He also found himself face-to-face with a very mature and very big bull moose. And it was obvious to him that critter was not happy, either. During the fall, most moose of the male variety have only two things on their minds. One is love in its most vigorous form. The other is pure and unadulterated hatred for anything that might resemble competition for the vigorous love thing. Since adult bull moose often tip the scales in excess of 1,800 pounds, they usually get their way with either some vigorous love or a knock-down fight. Oh, and since those critters stand around nine feet tall, that is something else that greatly aids them with either loving or fighting. Which of those two emotions was instantly in play when these two woodland residents came almost nose to nose on that overgrown lane is not entirely clear. But things began to happen very quickly, and Randy was not about to issue any return challenge. That bull let out the most audacious bellow my buddy had ever had the misfortune of hearing, and then it charged. My friend, being in reasonably good physical shape, did the only thing he could under the circumstances. He swapped ends and plunged back into the pucker-brush at what he described as “full speed plus a tad more.” Of course, full-speed when any human male is traveling through pucker-brush is never fast enough. But Randy is also smarter than normal. When he passed by a nearby spruce tree that he described as about six inches in diameter, he side-stepped, dodged behind it and kept on running. You see, a mature bull moose often has around 60 inches of antlers on its noggin. That might be a good thing for the moose because it impresses the lady moose, it can also hinder that beast at certain times or under certain conditions. Fortunately for Randy this turned out to be one of those occasions. The bull apparently hit that spruce tree dead-center at flank speed. It must have bounced off but it recovered quickly, and immediately continued its pursuit. My buddy passed another similar spruce, and did another side-step behind it as he continued rather rapidly on his merry way. The bull hit that tree too. But it was quickly back up to full-speed-ahead. A third tree also stopped it in its tracks, if only for another passing moment. Then it was off again on its own quest, and it was now clear to Randy that this big woodland bully was not about to be denied victory in this particular confrontation. Well, to cut a long story short, Randy lost count of the number of neat little side-steps behind a similar number of spruce trees in that plantation on his way back to his truck. He could clearly hear the bull moose behind him as it rammed into one spruce after another. It became readily apparent that none of those collisions served as a deterrence to its quest to meet my friend and pound him into a little red wad of hamburger. Then Randy made it back to his truck, and then he was inside his truck, and then he was desperately trying to find the keys for that truck. That was about when the bull came out of the pucker-brush and was face to bumper with that same truck. What happened next must have been anything but pretty. The bull charged, the truck lost, and the air-bags went off, knocking my friend senseless in an instant. The bull charged again, and the truck knew defeat a second time, this time being raised upward at a steep angle before flopping back down on the front two tires. Then the bull circled the truck, sticking an antler through the passenger-side window as it passed by. It then stepped up onto the bed of the truck, kicked out the rear window, and put both front hooves on the roof as it grunted out its apparent victory for all the world to hear. Now that contest must have been quite a sight. At the very least, Randy possessed the biggest hood ornament in modern history, if only for a few minutes. Then the moose stepped down, turned back into the pucker-brush, and disappeared into history. The damage to the truck was substantial, costing my buddy more than five grand, including a bent frame. The cost of a new bow and arrows because he couldn’t find the original one he had at the beginning of his ordeal was around $475. The cost of a case of beer to ease his bruised ego and tired muscles was 20 bucks. The feeling of relief that washed over my friend from surviving that encounter — priceless! * * * Another reader’s e-mailed question concerned what flies might work best for fall trout on area streams. Since fall trout are often on a nearly continuous feeding binge, they might hit just about any fly an angler presents. Here are my choices for fall trout. A Muddler’s minnow, dressed dry, looks like a grasshopper which is a common insect for many trout. Other terrestrial flies I would use include Dave’s hopper (foam bodies are nearly unsinkable), black ants (various patterns) and Letort crickets. For traditional dry flies, I’d select an Adams (spent wing), black gnat, brown bivisible, and irresistible Adams. Fly size is important, so I would suggest having a variety of smaller sizes. Generally this means #14 to #18. I am not a big fan of tiny midges, but sometimes only they will fool wary trout. So good luck, and be careful on those streams.
