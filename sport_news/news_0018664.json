(AP) - Peyton Barber rushed for two short touchdowns, including a 3-yarder with 7:56 remaining, helping Auburn outlast Kentucky 30-27 Thursday night and earn its first Southeastern Conference victory. \nSorely needing a conference win in hopes of contending in the West division, the Tigers (4-2, 1-2 SEC) started and closed strong behind Barber, who rushed for a 1-yard TD on their opening drive. His second score was the biggest, providing a critical buffer against Mikel Horton's 1-yard TD run with 4:06 left that brought Kentucky within a field goal. \nBarber finished with 92 yards on 26 carries, and Kerryon Johnson added 36 yards, including a 6-yard TD. Sean White threw for 255 yards, 154 to Ricardo Louis as the Tigers won their ninth straight in Lexington. \nKentucky's final attempt to at least tie the game ended with Patrick Towles being sacked on fourth down with 25 seconds left. \n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
