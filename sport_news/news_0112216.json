Andrew Hammond made 28 saves in his season debut. The Senators are 3-2-2. \nHenrique pulled New Jersey within a goal with 5:50 to go, scoring off a rebound. \n\"We handed them the third goal,\" Senators coach Dave Cameron said. \"You can't give teams a freebie and they got it.\" \nNew Jersey's Stephen Gionta received a major penalty and game misconduct for spearing Mark Borowiecki late in the second period, and Ottawa connected on the power play in the third. Hoffman scored his fourth of the season from the point at 2:24 of the third to give the Senators a 3-2 lead. Neil made it 4-2 at 6:38. \nZajac opened the scoring on a two-man advantage in the first period. The Senators tied it less than a minute later when Zibanejad intercepted Eric Gelinas' pass and beat Schneider for his first career short-handed goal. Tootoo gave New Jersey the lead with 1:30 later with another power-play goal. \nSmith tied it midway through the second. \n\"It's disappointing not getting the two points out of that,\" Neil said. \"We fought and clawed our way back into the game after two power-play goals and thought we did a good job for the most part of shutting them down. The late goal hurt us and it could have went either way at the end. The frustrating part is the two points.\" \nNotes: Ottawa defenseman Marc Methot remains day-to-day with a concussion, while left winger Clarke MacArthur missed his third straight game because of a concussion. ...
