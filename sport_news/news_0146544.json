Gone is Mike Freeze after taking a leave of absence. Kenny Iloka and Sammy Douglas are both gone due to season-ending injuries, as well as cornerback Ranthony Texada. Davion Pierson has yet to play a game this season and Mike Tuaua has also been suspended. Talk about early-season adversity. Throw in a road game against Texas Tech's high-powered offense led by Patrick Mahomes and it's by far the toughest game of TCU's early schedule.\nFor Texas Tech, it's all about redemption. The 55-point loss a season ago was one of many low points of Tech's season. The Red Raiders have already crossed one revenge game off its list (defeating Arkansas on the road). Now the Frogs are up.\nWhen Texas Tech has the ball\nCan they convert on third down? A year ago, the Red Raiders' up-tempo offense and a poor third down conversion rate doomed Kliff Kingsbury and Co. They converted on only 4-12 chances and had the ball for 10 less minutes than the Frogs. It'll be interesting to see if Tech attacks a defense with a bunch of new faces through the air or on the ground to keep Boykin off the field.\nWhen TCU has the ball\nTCU has lost a lot of personnel on the defensive side of the ball, so the Frogs might want to slow the game down a bit to keep Mahomes on the sideline. If so, Aaron Green and Trevvoris Johnson are going to be key. Green torched the Red Raiders a year ago racking up more than 100 yards on just six touches. Boykin is also a threat running the ball. The Heisman hopeful QB has also connected with Josh Doctson 17 times for 326 yards.\nPrediction\nMahomes has been one of the biggest surprises in all of the Big 12. Texas Tech also has valuable weapons in Jakeem Grant, Ian Sadler and Justin Stockton. However, questions still surround the defense which has yet to face a Big 12 offense under new defensive coordinator David Gibbs. Facing Boykin in no easy task. But the Red Raiders might be catching TCU at the right time with all of the questions surrounding the defense.\nThe Red Raiders have also cut back in one area that really hampered them in games a year ago. The penalties are down. A year ago the Red Raiders led the Big 12 with 89 penalty yards per game. Through three games this year, that number is down to 46 yards a game. They've stopped shooting themselves in the foot as much as they did a season ago.\nCombine the fewer mistakes with Mahomes' elevated level of play and a home game in Lubbock and the Red Raiders could pull the upset.\nScore: Texas Tech 52, TCU 49\nFollow Joshua Friemel on Twitter at @Josh_Friemel .\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel"], "published": "2015-09-24T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:49:51.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
