It is the first time the Cubs have had a playoff clinching game at home. Photo by Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images In 1989, the hit movie \"Back To The Future II\" predicted that the Chicago Cubs would win the World Series in the year 2015. It's just a movie, right? There's no way to possibly predict that the team that hasn't won the annual fall classic since 1908 would actually get the job done. But they may be on to something. Especially since the Cubs have eliminated the St. Louis Cardinals to advance to the NLCS . Could THIS finally be the year?\nOn Tuesday night, the Cubs wrapped up the National League Division Series with a 6-4 win at Wrigley Field. It ended the run of the Cardinals, who have dominated the NL Central for the majority of the last few years. Now in the movie, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) traveled in the famed Delorean time machine to the distant future -- which is now our present -- and sees a news report stating the Cubs won the World Series with a sweep of Miami. Now Miami didn't have a team back then. And many would argue the current status of the team that IS there now. But the fact remains that the residents of the friendly confines of Wrigley Field are just one step away from getting to that very point.\nDominating the postseason has been the performance of the Cubs' younger players and rookees. Most notably that of Anthony Rizzo , Starlin Castro and the surprise attack from Kyle Schwarber. The team set records for most home runs in a postseason, as they powered their way to a convincing defeat of possibly the toughest team in baseball. In fact, the top three teams in baseball this year came out of the NL Central. The Cardinals , Pittsburgh Pirates, and Cubs, in that order, had the three best records in the land. And now only one of those teams is still standing.\nChicago started the series in St. Louis at Busch Stadium. The Cardinals dominated Game 1 and many wondered if that was how the series would be played. But the next three games saw a complete turnaround, as Chicago took advantage of every opportunity they could and took Game 2 at Busch and both games at Wrigley to wrap up the series. Cubs fans rejoiced as manager Joe Maddon came out looking like a genius for the moves he made this year. Cubs president of baseball operations Theo Epstein talked after the game about what beating St. Louis meant to the team.\nWe beat the Cardinals. These guys are like our older brothers and they've been kicking sand in our face for 100 years. There's a lot of similarities to when the Red Sox knocked off the Yankees in 2004. This one just gives us a nice date on Saturday.\nThis was only the third time the Cubs have won consecutive postseason games at home. They also did it in the 1907 World Series against the Tigers and again in the 1984 NLCS against the San Diego Padres. Chicago entered this postseason 0-11 all time in any series in which they lost Game 1. They scored 14 combined runs in Games 3 and 4, and all but one came via the long ball. The Cubs had the home run swing in full effect throughout the series. The one run came from pitcher Jason Hammel's RBI single in the second inning of Tuesday's victory.\nNow they await the winner of the Mets/Dodgers NLDS series, which will have its decisive Game 5 on Thursday in Los Angeles. Clayton Kershaw and the Dodgers were able to avoid Tuesday night's elimination, and will bring the Mets back to Chavez Ravine for the final game of the series. The Cubs will travel to the winner of that game on Saturday, when the National League Championship Series begins. Joe Maddon hasn't made the decision on who his NLCS Game 1 starter will be, but it will likely be either Jake Arrieta or Jon Lester. Have Marty and Doc been right this whole time? We'll find out next week when the winner heads to the World Series.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:15:41.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
