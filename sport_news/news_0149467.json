Back Photo: 2 of 2 Next TNS Sam Riche Tribune News Services Jaguars cornerback Davon House defends Colts receiver Andre Johnson on Sunday in Indianapolis. Videos \nTampa Bay rookie quarterback Jameis Winston has trust in receivers Mike Evans and Vincent Jackson. \nWhy wouldn’t he? \nEvans and Jackson are both listed at 6-foot-5, weighing 231 and 230 pounds, respectively. \nMore important, they’re productive. \nEvans lived up to his first-round hype as a rookie last season, gaining 1,051 yards with 12 touchdowns. \nJackson, an 11-year veteran, has posted 1,000-yard seasons the last four years. \nWinston said Wednesday on a conference call with Jacksonville media that it was a “blessing” to have Evans and Jackson. \nThe trick for the Jaguars cornerbacks this week is to make Winston doubt that trust as Sunday’s game at Tampa plays out between the Jaguars (1-3) and Buccaneers (1-3). \n“They’ve got big-play guys on the perimeter,” Jaguars coach Gus Bradley said. “It will be a different challenge for us this week. These guys have both height and size. One was targeted 17 times in one game and in the next game another was targeted 15 times, so they go to both of them.” \nThe Jaguars’ best hope in trying to frustrate Winston is cornerback Davon House. The fifth-year veteran became a prime target for the Jaguars in free agency based on how he performed in Green Bay against bigger receivers like Atlanta’s Julio Jones and Detroit’s Calvin Johnson. \nJaguars general manager Dave Caldwell cited those examples after signing House to a four-year, $24.5 million contract with $10 million guaranteed in March. \nThe 6-foot, 196-pound House has only started 18 games in his career, four this season with the Jaguars, yet has posted 41 career breakups and two interceptions. \nHouse broke up two passes last week in a 16-13 overtime loss at Indianapolis. Evans and Jackson, however, are a different challenge than Colts speedy receiver T.Y. Hilton. \n“Even though they’re big guys they move like little guys,” House said. “Big guys like that are usually slow and can’t get on top on you. They both find a way to stretch the field. They’re very strong at the point of attack and sure-handed, so it will be a big challenge.” \nThe Colts game gave the secondary a needed dose of confidence, despite the loss. The Jaguars gave up 51 points to New England the week prior, in a game (51-17) where the Patriots never punted. \nBradley lamented not playing more man coverage against New England and relied on his philosophy more against Indianapolis. \nHouse said it was “very pleasing” to get back to the defense’s core principles. Bradley thought it helped House. \n“We got back to what we were doing,” Bradley said. “It was back to his wheelhouse and his comfort level.” \nOf course, House can only play one receiver at a time. Whether his focus is on Evans or Jackson, the other behemoth will be matched up on cornerbacks Aaron Colvin, Demetrius McCray or Dwayne Gratz. \n“It’s good for me,” said McCray (6-2, 194). “I’m a big corner, so now I don’t have to deal with the shiftiness of a little, short receiver. You know you’re going to have one 6-5, 220-plus receiver to your side. You’ve got to get ready for the matchup. It’s going to be fun.” \nThe Jaguars secondary has yet to intercept a pass this season. Linebacker Paul Posluszny has the team’s lone pick and that came in a season-opening loss to Carolina. \nWinston has thrown seven interceptions on 133 attempts, an average of one every 19 attempts. The Jaguars are hopeful that trust can lead to some gambles, which can become turnovers. \n“It’s always nice to have two 6-5 receivers,” said Colvin, who was limited in Wednesday’s practice with a shoulder injury. “Jameis should trust those guys. They do a lot of things for them. … Of course, every week we go into it thinking that we’re going to make plays. This is no different. Jameis has a lot of trust in those guys, so we know we’ll have the ball thrown our way.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:48:03.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
