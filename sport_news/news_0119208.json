With the Wolverines ahead 23-21 and 10 seconds left, Michigan punter Blake O'Neill bobbled a low snap, and spun around to try and make the kick. But he was hit, the ball popped free and Watts-Jackson caught it, broke a few tackles in the final yards and made it into the end zone. Michigan State (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten) has won seven of eight in the series, its best stretch in more than a half-century. Michigan (5-2, 2-1) lost for the first time since opening the season with a setback at Utah. (2) Baylor 62 West Virginia 38 WACO, Texas — Corey Coleman had three more touchdown catches and Baylor won its FBS-best 19th consecutive home game, beating West Virginia. Coleman matched and then broke the single-season school record for TD catches, his nation-leading 16 coming halfway through the regular season for the Bears (6-0, 3-0 Big 12). Seth Russell became the only Baylor quarterback other than Heisman Trophy winner Robert Griffin III in 2011 to throw for 300 yards and run for 100 yards in one game. Russell was 20 of 33 for 380 yards and five TD passes and ran 14 times for 160 yards with another score. Coleman finished with 10 catches for 199 yards, his fourth consecutive game with multiple touchdowns and his seventh in a row with at least 100 yards receiving. Baylor's only regular-season loss last year was 41-27 at West Virginia, and the Bears wound up being left out of the initial College Football Playoff. (10) Alabama 41 (9) Texas A&M 23 COLLEGE STATION, Texas — Derrick Henry ran for a career-high 236 yards and two scores and Alabama added a school record three touchdowns on interception returns to get a win over Texas A&M. Alabama (6-1, 3-1 SEC) built a 28-6 lead in the second quarter thanks to 55- and 6-yard touchdown runs by Henry and interception returns of 33 and 93 yards. Christian Kirk returned a punt 68 yards for a score just before halftime and Texas A&M (5-1, 2-1) added another touchdown on a 3-yard reception by Ricky Seals-Jones after a fumble early in the third to cut it to 28-20. But Alabama kicked two field goals before Minkah Fitzpatrick's 55-yard interception return for a score — his second of the day — made it 41-23 and sealed the victory. (11) Florida St. 41 Louisville 21 TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Everett Golson threw for 372 yards and three touchdowns and Florida State rallied in the second half to beat Louisville. Page 2 of 2 - It is the eighth 300-yard game of Golson's career and his second since transferring from Notre Dame this year. A 70-yard touchdown pass to Kermit Whitfield, who had nine receptions for 172 yards, gave the Seminoles (6-0, 4-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) a 20-14 lead with 8:05 remaining. Dalvin Cook had his fourth 100-yard game of the season, gaining 163 yards on 22 carries. Louisville's (2-4, 1-2) Lamar Jackson passed for a career-high 307 yards. Memphis 34 (13) Mississippi 24 MEMPHIS, Tenn. — Paxton Lynch threw for 384 yards and three touchdowns and Memphis stunned Mississippi. Memphis (6-0) has won 13 straight games dating to last season — the third longest streak in the nation. It was the first win for the Tigers over a ranked opponent since 1996. Ole Miss (5-2) jumped out to a 14-0 lead less than 6 minutes into the game — partly thanks to a 68-yard touchdown pass by receiver Laquon Treadwell on a trick play — but Memphis responded with 31 unanswered points to take a 31-14 lead early in the third quarter. Ole Miss' Chad Kelly was 33 of 47 for 372 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. (17) Iowa 40 (20) Northwestern 10 EVANSTON, Ill. — Reserve running back Akrum Wadley ran for 192 yards and tied Iowa's school record with four rushing touchdowns. With leading rusher Jordan Canzeri sidelined in the first quarter with an ankle injury, Wadley took over for Iowa (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten). The injury occurred following a short run when linebacker Jaylen Prater landed on Canzeri, folding his ankle under a pile of players. Northwestern (5-2, 1-2) lost for the second straight week after five consecutive victories. (19) Oklahoma 55 Kansas St. 0 MANHATTAN, Kan. — Baker Mayfield threw for five touchdowns and Oklahoma bounced back from its Red River upset to beat Kansas State, the first time the Wildcats have been shut out since 1996. Kansas State had delivered serious scares to Top 25 opponents each of the last two weeks but the Wildcats (3-3, 0-3 Big 12) were helpless against the Sooners (5-1, 2-1). Going into Saturday's game, Kansas State had scored in 234 straight games. (22) Toledo 63 Eastern Michigan 20 TOLEDO, Ohio — Phillip Ely threw for 327 yards and four touchdowns to help Toledo improve to 6-0 for the first time since 1997. The Rockets (6-0, 2-0 Mid-American Conference) led 28-6 at halftime, and then Ely really warmed up. He threw touchdown passes on Toledo's first two possessions of the second half, connecting with Corey Jones for a 55-yard score and then with Cody Thompson on an 88-yarder four minutes later. The touchdown to Thompson was the fourth-longest completion in school history, and it wasn't the only record book-worthy play of the game against Eastern Michigan (1-6, 0-3).
