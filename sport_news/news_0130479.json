Ariz. -- The Pittsburgh Penguins were hoping to get some separation from the rest of the Metropolitan Division in the early days of the 2015-16 season.\nThis probably isn't what they had in mind.\nTheir 2-1 loss to Arizona Saturday night dropped their record to 0-2, and leaves them behind no fewer than four teams in the Metropolitan. They are in a four-way tie with Columbus, New Jersey and Carolina for last place in the division; all are 0-2.\nThe Penguins, who opened the season with a 3-0 defeat Thursday in Dallas, have lost their first two games for the first time since 2010-11 and their first two away games for the first time since 2005-06, when they dropped their first five away games.\nTheir next chance to get a victory will come Tuesday night, when they will face Montreal in the home opener at Consol Energy Center.\nThe Penguins power play failed to generate anything except frustration for the second game in a row, going 0 for 4. It is 0 for 7 on the season.\nThe Coyotes have three former Penguins -- Steve Downie, Zbynek Michalek and Joe Vitale -- on their roster, but only Downie was in the lineup Saturday night.\nHe had several run-ins with Penguins right winger Patric Hornqvist and picked up an unsportsmanlike conduct minor for needlessly spraying snow on goalie Marc-Andre Fleury in the second period.\nDownie can be an effective agitator, but the Penguins had made it clear before the game that they wouldn't let him get them off their game.\n\"We all know how (Downie) can be,\" coach Mike Johnston said. \"He goes with how the game is going.\n\"If he feels he needs to stir it up physically, he's going to do that. But I believe our guys know how to play against any of those types of players.\"\nNeither team scored in the opening period, although both had some quality chances.\nOne of the Penguins' best came about 31/2 minutes before the intermission, when rookie winger Daniel Sprong hit the right post behind Arizona goalie Mike Smith.\nThe Coyotes had a 13-11 edge in shots on goal in the first 20 minutes.\nThe Penguins failed to capitalize on two power plays in the first period, leaving them 0 for 5 on the season.\nFleury repeatedly thwarted the Coyotes in the opening period, but they solved him five minutes into the second, when Tobias Rieder took a feed from Anthony Duclair and scored from the slot.\nThe Penguins responded almost immediately, though, on a superb individual effort by Phil Kessel.\nHe stripped the puck from Arizona's Shane Doan in the neutral zone, then carried it into the Coyotes' end and whipped a wrist shot past Smith from the top of the right circle at 5:17.\nThat was the Penguins' first goal of the season, which means they came within less than five minutes of tying the franchise record for the longest goal-less streak at the start of a season. They did not get a goal in the first 90 minutes, 13 seconds of the 2003-04 season.\nThe tie didn't last for long, however, because Jordan Martinook capped an extended scramble around the Penguins' crease by digging the puck out from under Fleury, then backhanding a shot past defenseman Ben Lovejoy and into the net at 7:29 for his first goal in the NHL.\nThe Penguins pressed for the goal that would have forced overtime in the third period, but Smith made several outstanding saves, most notably on Nick Bonino and Hornqvist.\n(c)2015 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\nVisit the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette at www.post-gazette.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1735865", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1735865&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1735865&h=Coyotes+nip+Pens%2C+2%2D1"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:22:38.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
