In the Big House tunnel, of course Joe Rexrode, Detroit Free Press 9:43 p.m. EDT October 21, 2015 MSU's Tom Izzo greets MSU and Michigan fans before the MSU Michigan football game in Ann Arbor Oct. 17. (Photo: Rod Sanford) \nEAST LANSING – If there’s a historic Michigan State sports moment these days, one of the first questions has to be: Where was Tom Izzo? \nThe answer: He was walking up the tunnel with his son, Steven, then quickly running back to the field amid the commotion as MSU’s Jalen Watts-Jackson returned a fumble to win 27-23 as time expired at Michigan on Saturday. Izzo said they left the field before time expired to be safe, then reveled in the victory with MSU football coach Mark Dantonio and his team. \n“I haven’t been to Michigan in a while (for football), it’s a little harder to go down there,” Izzo said. “I told Coach D. ‘You know, I’d like to take Steven down and see the big win,’ and he said, ‘Well just come down on the bench.’ I’m not a big press box guy as you all know. And God, it’s weird there because it seemed like our fans were scattered everywhere and we didn’t have really a section. So it was a little safer to be where I was.” \nThere’s no telling what kind of precarious position Izzo could find himself in Friday when the MSU men’s and women’s basketball teams stage their annual Midnight Madness at Breslin Center (free to the public, doors open at 8:30 p.m. for autographs, program begins at 9:30). His yearly entrances often are elaborate and sometimes involve great heights (he once rappelled from the ceiling). \nBefore getting to that and a team ranked No. 13 in the preseason USA Today coaches poll, coming off Izzo’s seventh Final Four, he is enjoying Dantonio’s unbeaten, 7th-ranked football team. Izzo and some of MSU’s football coaches gathered at Dantonio’s house – which is just a few feet from Izzo’s house – after Saturday’s win. \n“I’d be remiss if I didn’t say what an incredible job he’s done,” Izzo said of Dantonio. “To win 31 out of 34 games (since the start of the 2013 season) … those are incredible, incredible numbers. And it sure has made a lot of people here feel better about themselves, and I think it helps recruiting for all of our sports. And I can’t say enough of how enjoyable it is to sit at his house after a big game. Reminded me of old times.” Read or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1LN4gMf TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:33:32.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
