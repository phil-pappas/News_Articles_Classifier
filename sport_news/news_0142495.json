He was 76. \nBridges, whose No. 32 KU jersey was retired in a 2004 ceremony in Allen Fieldhouse, won all-conference honors in the Big Eight during all three seasons he played for the Jayhawks from 1959-61. \nA 6-foot-6 power forward from Hobbs, N.M., Bridges grabbed 1,000 rebounds in 78 collegiate games, a 13.9 rebound average that ranks second on the KU career charts behind only Wilt Chamberlain's career average of 18.3. Bridges' 14.1 rebound average in 1961 remains No. 3 on KU's single-season records. \nAfter leaving KU, Bridges was taken by the Chicago Packers – now the Washington Wizards – as the 32nd overall selection in the 1961 NBA draft. He played one season for the Kansas City Steers in the American Basketball League before beginning a 12-season NBA career that saw him play for the St. Louis/Atlanta Hawks, Philadelphia 76ers, Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors. He won an NBA championship with the Warriors in 1975 and was a three-time NBA all-star in 1967, ' 68 and '70.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:44:37.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
