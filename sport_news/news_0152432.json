Seven Toledo basketball and football players got money and other gifts to alter their play in games a decade ago. \nIn June, Manni was sentenced to nearly six years in prison for the Toledo scheme and other crimes. \nKaram's lawyer had said Karam was in his 80s and has poor health. He said it would be \"unthinkable\" to send Karam to prison. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:04:27.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
