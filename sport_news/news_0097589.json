Ford a sophomore who finished with four catches for 39 yards became the first Hokies receiver to catch three touchdown passes in a game since Ernest Wilford had four in a double-overtime game at Syracuse in 2002. \nMotley took a beating at one point coming out of the game for a play. He limped between plays in the fourth quarter. Hokies freshman running back Travon McMillian rushed for a game-high 96 yards including a 59-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter. Wolfpack quarterback Jacoby Brissett passed for 113 yards and a touchdown and also ran for 39 yards. Running back Matthew Dayes rushed for 66 yards. \nThe Virginia Tech defense held N.C. State's high-octane offense to 270 yards and one touchdown. The Hokies had four sacks and 11 tackles for loss. Tech defensive back Adonis Alexander intercepted Brissett in the fourth quarter to end the quarterback's streak of 241 straight passes without an interception. \nN.C. State took a 10-0 lead early in the second quarter on Brissett's 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jumichael Ramos. The Virginia Tech offense showed life on the ensuing possession driving 75 yards on five plays. Tech cut the N.C. State lead to 10-7 on a 27-yard touchdown pass from Motley to Ford with 11:41 remaining in the second quarter. It was the first of Ford's three second-quarter touchdowns. His 5-yard catch put Tech up 14-10 with 5:54 left in the second quarter and he scored again on a 2-yard touchdown reception with 18 seconds left until halftime. Wolfpack kicker Kyle Bambard booted field goals of 33 yards in the first quarter and 36 yards in the third quarter that cut the Hokies' lead to 21-13.  //on.wvec.com/1LonbN6 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:31:44.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
