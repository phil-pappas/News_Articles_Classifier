New Zealand and South Africa will contest the other semi. \nMeanwhile, the morning after the big night before, the All Blacks found themselves in familiar territory, heading to the RWC semifinals with everyone gushing about their latest performance. \nNew Zealand’s 62-13 thrashing of France in the quarterfinal in Cardiff not only assured the All Blacks of a trip to London for next weekend’s semis but also removed any doubt about their status as favorites to win the tournament. \nThe defending champions had been below their best in the pool phase but their nine-try romp over France proved what everyone had suspected all along — they were foxing. \nThe All Blacks have learnt the hard way that the trick to winning World Cups is to save you best for last and not take anything for granted. \nNew Zealand has made the semifinals in six of the seven previous World Cups, but only gone on to win the title twice, in 1987 and 2011, both on home soil. \nOn almost each occasion, it has been the overwhelming favorite to win, but the heavy burden of expectation has proved fatal before, and the New Zealand team management is wary about the pitfalls of complacency. \n“All we have done is earn the right to go training on Monday,” the All Blacks coach Steve Hansen barked. “We haven’t won the thing, so we can’t get too excited. That would be pointless.” \nDespite winning the first (1987) and last (2011) World Cups, New Zealand remains driven by its past failures. \nIt went 24 years between titles and no team faces more scrutiny than the All Blacks, whether they are heaped with lavish praise or reminded of their past failures. \nNow, the All Blacks face South Africa, at Twickenham. Once again, they are in the familiar position as favorites but every bit wary of a Springboks team they know will be plotting their downfall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T22:09:44.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
