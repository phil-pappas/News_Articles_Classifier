By Ken Corbitt ken.corbitt@cjonline.com \nMANHATTAN — Kansas State football player Cre Moore was arrested on a charge of driving while under the influence of drugs or alcohol after he was involved in a one-vehicle crash early Sunday morning. \nThe Riley County Police Department responded to an accident near the intersection of Poyntz and Evergreen avenues at approximately 2:55 a.m. Sunday, according to the department’s activity report. They found a 2014 Ford F150 driven by Moore had left the roadway and collided with a light pole and a privately owned stone stairwell. \nMoore, 20, did not sustain injuries but there was “major damage” to the front driver’s side. The front driver’s side wheel became detached as a result of the collision. \nMoore, a back-up defensive back for the Wildcats, was charged with DUI and was found to be in possession of “several pills which were identified as depressants,” according to the report. He was given a bond of $3,500 for the offenses of DUI and possession of a depressant. He is no longer confined at the Riley County jail. \nMoore is a sophomore reserve defensive back from Broken Arrow, Okla., who had one tackle in the Wildcats' 36-34 loss Saturday at Oklahoma State. \nDuring the Big 12 coaches teleconference Monday, K-State coach Bill Snyder was asked if he knew how he would handle the matter. \n“Yes, I do know how I will handle that,” said Snyder, who declined further comment. \nKen Corbitt can be reached at (785) 295-1123 or ken.corbitt@cjonline.com .Follow Ken on Twitter @KenCorbitt .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:05:52.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
