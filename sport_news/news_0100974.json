Not in 1985 for Hurricane Gloria. And definitely not in the great unnamed hurricane of 1938, when weather technology was in its infancy and residents were given no advance warning at all.\nIt wasn’t until 2011, with Tropical Storm Irene approaching Massachusetts, that officials with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority decided to cancel service as a precaution for what they expected would be pouring rain and heavy winds.\n The dangers of being open for a tropical storm are mostly related to the wind. High gusts can disrupt the Green and Orange Lines on their above-ground routes, and trees and other debris can knock down trolley electrical wires. That happened in the Great Hurricane of 1938, causing injuries and leaving officials to rope off entire sections of streets, according to a 1938 Globe article.\nMBTA spokesperson Joe Pesaturo said the decision to suspend service isn’t based on a specific set of conditions, but is a judgment largely based on safety concerns.\n“I think in the past the MBTA’s perspective was ‘let’s run until we can’t,’” Richard Davey, the MBTA general manager at the time, said in an email on Thursday. “What I can tell you is that the infrastructure is fragile now, so running until you can’t isn’t prudent for a variety of reasons.”\nLike much of the public, MBTA officials have been eyeing Hurricane Joaquin in the Atlantic Ocean. Though the Category Four storm now looks to be headed out to sea, a look at the MBTA’s history dealing with storms shows the potential for precautionary closures if it comes near Boston’s shores.\nTropical Storm Irene largely missed Boston, causing some consternation among stranded passengers. But Davey said the MBTA’s emphasis nowadays is on “certainty,” rather than dealing with the blows as they come and leaving passengers in the dark.\nThe transit agency aims to inform customers about possible closures as far in advance as possible, Davey said.\nThe MBTA also shut down ahead of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, though with little warning. The T announced at 10 a.m. on that Monday that it would close for the day at 2 p.m., offering just a four-hour window to leave early from work or schools.\n“We could have just not run service at all,’’ Davey said at the time. “But we heard from the hospitals and medical profession last year during Hurricane Irene that it really put a burden on the medical community.”\nGallery: What the MBTA used to look like\nPrevious -- of -- Next A woman walks in the shadows under the elevated line on Washington Street in 1969.
