Overall, there were a few changes in the Top 10 of the rankings.\nWith the Ohio State Buckeyes , and the Baylor Bears holding strong as the top two teams, the Utah Utes moved up to No.3 in the AP Top 25 Poll . The Utes defeated Arizona State 34-18 to move their record to (6-0). Entering the fourth quarter, Utah was down by four points, but they scored 20 unanswered to defeat the Sun Devils. The Utes garnered the second most first place votes with 16.\nDue to the Utes rise, the No.4 TCU Horned Frogs dropped a spot after beating Iowa State by 24 points. It’s not the first time the Horned Frogs have dropped in the rankings, and it doesn’t appear to be the last. Trevone Boykin threw four touchdown passes, and helped lead the Horned Frogs to 31 unanswered points in the final three quarters. Boykin also scored on a rushing touchdown.\nA pair of Tigers changed their stripes on Sunday. No.5 LSU jumped ahead of Clemson after beating Florida on Saturday night. Both teams are undefeated, and they each received a first place vote this week.\nMichigan State was one play from dropping out of the Top 10, but they won their game, and stayed at No.7. However, there was movement directly behind the Spartans. The Alabama Crimson Tide jumped two spots to No.8, while No.9 Florida State rose a couple spots as well. The final team in the Top 10 is Stanford. They jumped up five places, and are the second PAC-12 team in the Top 10.\nThe Memphis Tigers went from unranked to No.18 this week. After defeating the Ole Miss Rebels, the Tigers set the stage for an intriguing AAC race. Three American Athletic teams are in the Top 25, and they are all undefeated. The No.21 Houston Cougarr are one spot ahead of the No.22 Temple Owls.\nThe No.25 Pittsburgh Panthers joined the Top 25 AP Poll for the first time this season.
