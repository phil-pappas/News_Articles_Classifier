I don't doubt that figure accurately reflects tickets distributed for the game. But it's laughable to believe that many people actually attended.\nForcing the Beavers to play a steady diet of late night games is killing home attendance for OSU, which has few local hotel options and a fan base that comes from some distance.\nAt some point, people are simply going to stop buying tickets for games that are scheduled only to provide live, late-night television programming.\nI know some readers of this blog are sick of the subject. Too bad. I'm going to keep hammering on it until the nail starts to sink in.\nThis week, Arizona plays at Washington in a game scheduled to start 8 p.m.\nOK, Pac-12's television partners ponied up big bucks to earn the right to dictate the schedule. But I think that is a long-term loser if the conference winds up curtailing home attendance.\nThe conference needs to take a more proactive stance to minimize the damage the start times are doing.\nOK, links:\nStanford, Utah and Wazzu head my ballot this week for The O's Pac-12 Power Rankings.\nHow The O's Power Rankings turned out.\nAnd, just for comparison sake, here is the ESPN.com version of the conference power rankings.\nESPN Pac-12 guru Ted Miller: The conference title picture is muddy.\nThe Merc's Jon Wilner: The conference race is about to descend on ...
