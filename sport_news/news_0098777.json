Clemson (5-0, 2-0), who was ranked No. 6 last week, blew by Georgia Tech (2-4, 0-3), 43-24, and trended upward for the second straight week. \nFlorida State also took a step forward, as the Seminoles (5-0, 3-0) jumped up from No. 12 to No. 11 thanks to their 29-24 victory over archrival Miami on Saturday. \nDuke (5-1, 2-0), who crushed Army 44-3, landed in the top 25 for the first time this year, coming in at No. 25. \nNorth Carolina (4-1,1-0) had off this weekend and received one vote. \nOhio State continued to hold on to No. 1 ranking, but its grip on the top spot isnâ€™t as firm as a total of six teams got at least one first-place vote. \nBaylor is closing in on the Buckeyes and moved up from the No. 3 spot to No. 2, flip-flopping spots with TCU.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T23:28:38.908+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
