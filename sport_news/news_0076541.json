It was such a big decision, why didn't they go to the TMO for that?\" Scotland captain Greig Laidlaw said after the game, describing himself as \"lost for words\". \n\"It's the toughest defeat I've ever had to take,\" added the scrumhalf, who kicked 19 points. \nEver-calm Australia coach Michael Cheika, asked about the incident, said: \"It's a penalty and that's the way it works. You've still got to kick it.\" \nThe battle between the winners of the Rugby Championship and the side who finished last in the Six Nations after losing every game looked a mismatch on paper but there was nothing between them in what developed into a monumental see-saw battle. \nAustralia were totally dominant for the first 10 minutes and were rewarded with an Adam Ashley-Cooper try. \nIt looked ominous for Scotland but they roared back with a Laidlaw penalty and try by Peter Horne when the Wallaby defence momentarily froze at a ruck. \nAustralia then turned to their forwards for a 10-phase assault that opened the door for Drew Mitchell to get their second try. \nAustralia's scrum, highly praised for how it dealt with England, found the Scottish version a tougher proposition and Laidlaw landed another penalty after a collapse. \nAgain Australia hit back, opting for a lineout instead of a shot at goal and validating the decision by driving flanker Michael Hooper over. \nFoley missed all three conversions though to allow Scotland to change round with an unlikely 16-15 lead. \nThe Wallabies had never won a World Cup match having trailed at the break but took only three minutes to regain the lead after Scotland wing Sean Maitland was yellow carded for a deliberate knock-on. \nAustralia again kicked for touch, mauled forward and sent Mitchell straight through the hole where Maitland should have been. \nFive minutes later they repeated the trick on the other wing, Ashley-Cooper crossing, only for the TMO to chalk it off for a knock on. \nScotland continued to show real adventure with the ball and got back to within a point when Finn Russell charged down a Foley kick and popped the ball up for Tommy Seymour to score. \nAgain Australia hit back as Tevita Kuridrani forced his way over for their fifth try and, with Foley's conversion, they led 32-24 and looked safe. \nHowever, another Laidlaw penalty and an unexpected downpour, gave Scotland a chance going into the final 10 minutes. \nThat simmering hope turned into a deafening roar when Mark Bennett intercepted a James Slipper pass to level, with Laidlaw's conversion putting the Scots two points ahead and dreaming of their first semi-final since 1991. \nAustralia, however, as they so often do, mustered one more attack and, despite Scottish pleas for TMO help, took full advantage of their last-gasp escape route to stay in the hunt for a third World Cup. \nWhile they hugged each other in joy, Joubert did not hang around for the usual handshakes and, remarkably, sprinted to the safety of the tunnel. \n(Editing by Nick Mulvenney/Rex Gowar) \nOur top photos from the past week.
