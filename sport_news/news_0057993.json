(Photo: Crystal LoGiudice, USA TODAY Spor)\n1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE The idea of a College Football Playoff Eliminator is that with only 3% of FBS teams able to make the Playoff, the herd has to be thinned. And it's not all going to be thinned on Dec. 6, when the Playoff selection committee announces its Football Four.\nLast year the eliminator policy was simple: Lose to a Group of Five team, and you're not making the Playoff. Lose twice to a Power Five team, and you're not making the Playoff.\nThis year, I am changing the rubric to factor Playoff selection committee behavior and a metric I have been using to track college and pro football efficiency for nearly a decade.\nHow it works Two aspects of college football have defined the past 15 national champions and last year's four inaugural Playoff teams. Talent and scoring efficiency. Every national champion started the season as a top 10 team in CFBMatrix talent rankings and ended the regular season with a top three rank in offense and/or defense scoring efficiency.\nFollow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. This is a long-term view, as each week team will slide in and out of the top two tiers. But by selection Sunday, I expect the process to sift out the non-contenders and leave us with the four teams the committee ultimately chooses to move to the semifinals. The only part of this process that may need to be retraced is the two-loss-and-you're-out qualifier as a two-loss LSU team won the title several years back.\nOK, Group of Five teams, you are all out. As long as the selection committee has strength of schedule to consider, you don't have a chance. You do will not have enough quality wins, and your physicality index is too low. Marshall was undefeated in the first committee rankings of 2014 and couldn't crack the top 20. Yes, a team will get into a New Year's Six bowl that the opposition will not practice for and few will watch. But that is as good as it gets. If you believe in the need to factor SOS in your Playoff field, this is the only way.\nEach week I take the overall list of contenders and divide it into three tiers. This shifts every week, as it is based on my Scoring Efficiency Metric Chart. Every national champion the past 10 years has ranked in the top three in offense or defense. Every 2014 Playoff team was top 25 in total scoring efficiency, and all but Florida State were top 10.\nFIRST FOUR IN LSU, Utah, Baylor, Ohio State.\nFIRST FOUR OUT Florida State, TCU, Clemson, Michigan State.\nTIER I — National champion pool Teams that are top 3 in offense or defense scoring efficiency:\nBaylor: No. 1 offense, No. 1 overall scoring efficiency\nTCU: No. 2 offense, No. 9 overall scoring efficiency\nTIER II — Playoff contenders Power Five teams that are top 25 in overall scoring efficiency but not top 3 in either offense or defense (in order of rank):\nOhio State, Florida State, Iowa, Utah.\nTIER III — The rest All other Power Five programs with with zero or one loss, but that are not top 25 in total scoring efficiency:\nCalifornia, Duke, Pittsburgh, Penn State, Michigan State, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Clemson, LSU, Duke, North Carolina, Stanford, Alabama, Notre Dame, Florida.\nEliminated All Group of Five teams, Virginia, Vanderbilt, Kansas, Louisville, Nebraska, Texas, Rutgers, Arkansas, Iowa State, South Carolina, Oregon, Washington, Arizona State, Georgia Tech, Auburn, Virginia Tech, Tennessee, Maryland, BYU, Mississippi State, Vanderbilt, Boston College, Wisconsin, Arizona, Colorado, Miami, Syracuse, West Virginia, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Georgia, North Carolina State, Kansas State, USC, Texas Tech, UCLA, Northwestern, Michigan, Ole Miss.\nTo read more Visit CFBMatrix.com to read more about undervalued and overvalued teams and look back the site's preseason national title contenders .\nDave Bartoo is the founder and manager of CFBMatrix.com .\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL VIDEO PLAYLIST\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL VIDEO PLAYLIST Five games you can't miss in Week 8 of college football | 02:14 USA Today Sports' George Schroeder offers up the five games you can't miss in Week 8 of the college football season.
