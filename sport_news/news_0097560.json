I'd be hopeful but it's not a decision for me. Hopefully it's not something that impacts on us. \n\"Considering the dressing room at the moment, we can ill-afford to lose another player, particularly a player of Sean's experience and standing in the group.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:00:42.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
