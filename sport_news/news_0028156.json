There's a path of continuity, performances and behavior to follow.\"\nSo if Balotelli does return to Italy's squad for next year's tournament in France, he'll do so without having played a single qualifier.\nThe Euros, it should be noted, were the stage on which Balotelli performed best, scoring both goals in Italy's 2-1 semifinal win over Germany in 2012.\nWith or without Balotelli, Conte believes the Azzurri can contend.\n\"You've got to be ambitious to go all the way,\" the coach who led Juventus to three straight Serie A titles said. \"We know full well that there are stronger national squads but with our work ethic and the quality that we have we can go for it.\n\"I'm not interested in saying if we'll finish in the last four or 12,\" Conte added. \"I don't believe in paper rankings — they're made to be disproved. But we're going to France to give bother to everyone.\"\nA four-time World Cup winner, Italy's only European Championship title came in 1968.\nConte's squad is undefeated in qualifying, having won six matches and drawn three.\nBesides Eder and Pelle, Conte has also helped revive the career of Stephan El Shaarawy, whose winning goal Saturday ended a three-year scoring drought with the national team.\nThe son of an Egyptian father and an Italian mother, the 22-year-old El Shaarawy has been hailed as one of Italy's best young players for years but he struggled with injuries and confidence in recent seasons. After failing to make Italy's squad for last year's World Cup, he transferred from AC Milan to Monaco.\n\"We knew it was a key match for qualification and we went out onto the pitch determined and focused,\" El Shaarawy said. \"We produced a performance filled with character, heart and grit.\"\nThe match was also notable for the performance of another 22-year-old. Playing in place of the injured midfield maestro Andrea Pirlo, Verratti set the tone for the match when he launched a long, vertical pass for Eder that set up the opening goal 11 minutes in.\nAnd Manchester United fullback Matteo Darmian sealed the result with his first national team goal.\n\"The squad is improving,\" Conte said. \"Now we've got to continue like this.\"\nWith or without Balotelli.\n___\nAndrew Dampf can be followed at www.twitter.com/asdampf\n1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
