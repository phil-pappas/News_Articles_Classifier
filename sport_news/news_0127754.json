He has since been replaced by an acting president.\nEsquivel is accused by American authorities of receiving bribes worth millions of dollars in connection with the sale of marketing rights to the Copa America tournaments in 2007, 2015, 2016, 2019 and 2023.\nEsquivel is appealing against the decision last month by the Swiss justice ministry to grant an American extradition request, the Berne-based justice office said.\nAn earlier statement by the Federal Criminal Court, which didn't name Esquivel, said he had sought bail because of his \"advanced age and poor state of health.\" That was \"not regarded as sufficient to counter the risk of absconding,\" the court said.\nThe court also found that he was \"more than capable of traveling,\" has no close ties to Switzerland and electronic monitoring would not reduce his flight risk. Further medical tests are being carried out.\nExtradition requests have also been granted for ousted FIFA vice president Eugenio Figueredo and former Costa Rican federation president Eduardo Li.\nThree other men are in custody in Switzerland after being indicted in the corruption case launched by the U.S. Justice Department and arrested while here for the FIFA Congress in May.\nThe U.S. blocked Nicaragua's attempt to extradite FIFA development staffer Julio Rocha. Costas Takkas, a British aide to former FIFA vice president Jeffrey Webb, and Jose Maria Marin, who was president of the 2014 World Cup organizing committee in Brazil, remain in custody.\nWebb is the only one of seven men arrested in Zurich to now be in the U.S.\nSepp Blatter is still in power at FIFA after rejecting demands on Friday from four sponsors to quit immediately instead of remaining president until the emergency election in February.\nWhen contacted by The Associated Press on Monday, Coca-Cola, Budweiser brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev and McDonald's all declined to say what their response would be to Blatter snubbing their request. Visa did not respond to questions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:03:53.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
