If you can’t block, you’re probably not going to gain many yards on offense. And if you can’t hold your ground, you’re probably not going to stop anyone on defense. With valuable experience and a little more size than years past to call upon, North Medford’s front wall of defense has set the tone thus far as one of the top producing units in Southwest Conference football. Leading the charge has been junior tackle Tre Holmes, senior tackle Michael Polataivao, senior end David Patstone and junior ends Daniel Ibarra and A.J. Raye. “They’ve played really solid all year,” says North Medford head coach Mike Mitchell, whose team is 3-2 overall and 2-1 in SWC play. “I think our defensive front is really one of the strengths of this team.” Through five weeks, the Black Tornado defense ranks first in the SWC in total defense at 275.4 yards allowed per game and scoring defense at 19.6 points allowed per game. While the linebacker corps and safeties get a little more glory when it comes to tackles per game, there’s no question where it all starts on defense at North Medford. “If they have a bad game they take that personally because they really understand that our defense really has to start with them,” says Jake Palaniuk, first-year defensive coordinator for the Black Tornado. “With a lot of strength in our linebacker corps, they’re willing to do anything to take on double teams or whatever to free up our linebackers. The sacrifices they make are tremendous. We talk a lot about biting the bullet to put other guys in position to make tackles and they’re all willing to do whatever it takes to help our defense.” All that will definitely come to the forefront on Friday when North Medford plays host to Grants Pass (3-2, 2-1 SWC). The Cavemen boast one of the biggest frontlines in the SWC and power an offensive unit that is averaging around 410 yards and 34 points per game. Only Willamette has gained more yards on the ground than Grants Pass (1,105 yards) thus far, and that’s only by 31 yards. “They have to play well against Grants Pass, they really do,” Mitchell says of his defensive line. “(The Cavemen have) a few guys that we’ve got to handle on both sides of the ball. It’s certainly doable, we don’t think they’re an invincible team, but we think we’ve got to play well to do it.” The importance of being productive is not lost on the Black Tornado defenders each week, but they certainly respect the challenge that stands in front of them on Friday. “For this game we definitely need to stop the run,” says Holmes. “I think we’ve done good on the run so far but this game definitely needs to be our breakout game where us four up front really fly around to the ball and stop them so they don’t get those big runs.” While each defender possesses standout qualities in their own right, Palaniuk says North Medford definitely leans on Holmes’ leadership and abilities. The 6-foot, 270-pounder was a late addition to the varsity when he was a freshman and has evolved into one of the team’s most consistent performers. “Tre really sets the tone in practice and in games,” says Palaniuk. “On Friday night Tre always shows up to play, but in practice his level of intensity is contagious to all those guys. If he comes out in practice and he’s jacked up, it has an effect on the three guys out there with him. If he makes a play, they want to make a play.” As for his counterparts, Holmes says North Medford has a well-balanced setup on that front wall with Polataivao (6-5, 300), Patstone (5-11, 200), Ibarra (6-3, 285) and Raye (6-4, 260). “A.J. is really good at the pass rush and getting hands off of people,” says Holmes. “Patty is really good with his hands and really quick with his feet, and Michael is really good with power and pushing people back. Then there’s Danny Ibarra, who’s really good at stopping the run and clogging the holes.” “It’s definitely a well-rounded group,” he adds, “and we always have someone out there who’s a little better at something that someone else isn’t as good at.” As for Holmes, Polataivao says he’s the most well-rounded of the bunch. “Tre is pretty good with everything,” he says. “He’s a good rusher, he has power and he always comes through and knows what to do.” One of the keys to the group is, despite their size, the Black Tornado defenders are more mobile than one would predict. “These are 270- and 300-pound kids and they can move,” says Mitchell. “These are good athletes, they’re not just big guys plugging holes. And we’ve been able to put pressure on quarterbacks with all these guys.” Holmes and senior linebacker Will Spence lead North with four sacks apiece, with linebackers Praise Villamu and Derek Kinsey joining Patstone and Polataivao with at least one sack apiece. Being in the trenches is not for the faint of heart, according to Holmes, which is why he enjoys the constant challenge. “Once you get the play call, you just have to push everything else aside and just tell yourself it’s me against this guy and who’s going to win?” says Holmes. “I know I don’t want to lose so I’m going to go as hard as I can.” That expects to be the mindset again on Friday. “We’re not going to back down,” says Holmes. “The four of us all have the motivation and the mindset that we can beat anybody and we can overpower anybody as long as you put your mind to it. If you just play as hard as you can, anything can happen. We definitely know on Friday it’s going to be a dogfight and come down to an in-the-trenches, hard-fought game. Hopefully we come out on top and we play our hardest and get the ‘W.’” Reach reporter Kris Henry at 541-776-4488, khenry@mailtribune.com, www.facebook.com/krishenryMT or www.twitter.com/Kris_Henry", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:46:32.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
