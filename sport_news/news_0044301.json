Nikola Mirotic slid over the small forward, with Tony Snell sidelined with an ankle injury. And with Kirk Hinrich nursing a foot issue, E'Twaun Moore was back at point guard.\nThe tall-front-line lineup didn't deliver. The Bulls trailed 17-7 by the time Hoiberg sent Taj Gibson onto the floor for the game's first substitution.\nAfter halftime, Hoiberg went with a completely different look. Noah was on the bench, Mirotic was back at power forward, and Doug McDermott was the small forward. If anyone thought Noah was simply being rested, that outlook changed when Hoiberg subbed Noah for Gasol during the third quarter.\n\"I wanted to get that big lineup out there (at the start),\" Hoiberg said after the game. \"Obviously, with as many bigs as we have right now and a lot of the guys are going to have a chance to play a lot of minutes in the rotation, I wanted to try Niko at some three. We weren't very energetic out of the gate and they jumped out to a 10-point lead on us.\"\nThe frontcourt rotation became more crowded Wednesday with Gibson making his preseason debut. He has been taking things slowly in camp after having left-ankle surgery in June. Gibson played just less than 10 minutes in the first half, producing 4 points and 2 rebounds.\n\"Taj was done (by halftime),\" Hoiberg said. \"He wasn't going to get any more minutes, so I started Niko and Pau together at the four-five and obviously it worked pretty well.\"\nWith a more conventional lineup on the floor, the Bulls opened the third quarter with a 17-9 run. The second half began with a pair of Mirotic 3-pointers. On the third trip down the floor, Mirotic called for the ball loudly, but Moore already was driving to the hoop and dropped in a bank shot.\nAfter the game, Gasol suggested giving the big front line more time before making a judgment.\n\"We started off a little slow,\" he said. \"For the first time that Niko's been at the three this season, barely has practiced the three at all. I think it was a good test overall. Again, it was not something we had a chance to work together and play together in that type of lineup. We tried today.\"\nThe Bulls turned in another forgettable fourth quarter to give this one away. Trailing 76-75 heading into the fourth, they let Detroit shoot 63 percent while being outscored 38-16. Hoiberg decided to give Jordan Crawford and Cristiano Felicio some meaningful minutes. The Bulls fell apart while those two were on the floor.\nMoore led the Bulls with 16 points. Aaron Brooks was next with 13, while Doug McDermott scored 12.\n• Get the latest Bulls news via Twitter by following @McGrawDHBulls.\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
