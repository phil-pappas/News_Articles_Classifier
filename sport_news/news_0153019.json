Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal Aidan Fitzmaurice â€“ 02 October 2015 03:00 AM\nWith little time to reflect on Wednesday's Champions League win over Wolfsburg, the Red Devils are in Premier League action on Sunday against Arsenal, looking to extend their lead at the top of the table.\nVan Gaal has two years left on his contract at Old Trafford but the 64-year-old plans to walk away from the game after that, once he has tasted league success in England.\n\"I always want more,\" he said. \"I have set my aims always in advance.\n\"It's the same thing as what I'm doing now. I shall retire. I always do what I have said.\n\"I have always set my own aims and I think that I have set my last aim also,\" added van Gaal, who has won league titles in three countries already.\nArsenal will come into Sunday's battle with morale low after their Champions League loss and van Gaal is at a loss to explain how such a talented side have under-performed.\n\"Arsenal are technically and tactically the best team in the league.\n\"Nevertheless, they haven't won so much, so you have to look for that improvement with that team,\" added van Gaal.", "external_links": ["http://www.independent.ie/incoming/article31575743.ece/5c89d/ALTERNATES/h342/SOCCER%20Man%20Utd.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:19:32.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
