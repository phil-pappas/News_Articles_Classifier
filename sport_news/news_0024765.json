For the past two days, she explains, he has skipped the number three on his way to five.\nToday, however, he gets it. And more. He successfully counts to 10 without skipping a single number. As they finish up the one-on-one session, Pierre gives the excited boy a high-five to celebrate.\nRosa Parks Elementary School Rosa Parks Elementary School switched from a traditional September-to-June school year to one that offers instruction year round in nine-week quarters. The hope is that less time off in the summer and longer intersession breaks will boost student success. The editorial board of The Oregonian/ OregonLive is checking in with the school from time to time to examine the costs and benefits of a year-round schedule and what we can learn from it. Today: Intervention week Previous editorials Progress may come in small steps at times. But it is progress, administrators and teachers note, at a school that has long struggled to help its largely low-income student population meet academic benchmarks. These small wins are also among the only ways so far to gauge whether Rosa Parks Elementary's decision to convert to a year-round school schedule last year is worth the investment.\nWe last visited Rosa Parks Elementary when the school year started – in mid July. There was considerably less grumbling by families this time around compared to last year, said Principal Tamala Newsome. But it is undoubtedly a difficult switch from how things used to be. Under the year-round schedule, school quarters last nine weeks with three-week breaks in between and a five-week break at the end – totaling the same number of school days as in a traditional school year.\nLimiting summer vacation helps stem the summer slide that teachers had been seeing in their students and lets them reclaim weeks that previously were lost to reviewing past material, Newsome said. But another advantage of the schedule is the ability to schedule extra instruction during the last week of each of the three inter-session breaks for those students who are falling behind.\nThe additional days don't come cheap. Rosa Parks gets about $60,000 more for paying teachers, staff and other costs for instruction for 12 extra days – four days for each of the three intervention weeks during the school year. The school identifies those who are not meeting academic benchmarks and invites them to attend the session, which takes place in the last week of each break. With far fewer students, teachers can focus on individuals or small groups more effectively, helping them identify each student's challenges, working with them through language barriers (about one-third of students are nonnative English speakers) or drilling them on skills that they don't get time for in a full classroom setting.\nIn last week's intervention session for the approximately 150 students who participated, that meant addition and multiplication exercises for some, writing assignments for others or discussion of the concepts behind math. While the students get time for physical education and other activities, the focus is on math and English, said Assistant Principal Reiko Williams.\nEditorial Agenda 2015\nMake Portland a city that works Get pot right Smart choices for education\nHelp rural Oregon\nKeep people and goods moving\nFoster small business growth\nTrack health reforms", "external_links": ["http://www.pps.k12.or.us/schools/rosaparks/"], "published": "2015-10-11T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:38:38.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
