And when results are back and we have better stability in our confidence levels, then we go back to what we are.\"\nThe win eases some of the pressure on Mourinho who needed a public vote of confidence from Chelsea owner Roman Abramovic after a 3-1 home defeat by Southampton in their previous match.\nAbramovic was seen smiling in his private box at the end of Saturday's game.\nBut for Aston Villa coach Tim Sherwood, whose side have not won in the league since the opening weekend, the pressure remains intense amid media speculation his job is on the line.\n\"I've seen those reports. People have been reminding me a few times about them. But I have had no indication that the clock is ticking,\" he said.\n\"I am under no illusion that as a football manager you need to win matches. If you don't, then invariably you lose your job somewhere down the line.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:59:04.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
