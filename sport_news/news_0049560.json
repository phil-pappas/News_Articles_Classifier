And on his second play from scrimmage, with the Argos behind 28-2, he looked like the confident Ray of old, firing a nice 19-yard pass up the middle to Kevin Elliott deep in Toronto territory.\nAt one point he was five-for-five for 36 yards through the air as he focused on short-range targets.\nWith six seconds left in the game, he threw what appeared to be a touchdown pass to Elliott, but both teams were penalized for pass interference and the down was replayed.\nOn second-and-six, another pass for Elliott arrived a little late and was knocked down at the goal line by Billy Parker. A third down-down pass to Hazelton went incomplete.\nRay’s leadership seemed to put a bit of a spark in Toronto’s sluggish offence. He finished 12-of-15 for 94 yards.\nIn the end, however, it was too much to ask Ray to overcome a big deficit in his first game since he suffered a concussion last November in Montreal.\nThe Argos went down 34-2 before an announced crowd of 3,741 while going head to head with the Blue Jays in Kansas City. The Argos fell to 9-7, while the Alouettes, now 6-10, stayed alive in the playoff hunt.\nThis was the second week in a row that the Argons had been relocated here and the second time they had to go head-to-head with the Jays. Last week, they lost to Calgary in front of 3,401 fans.\nIn all, these road warriors have played four home games away from the Rogers Centre. In fact, they have played more times in Hamilton (four), including two as visitors, than they have at their own home (three).\nThe Argos conclude their season with two more home games, next week against the B.C. Lions and the season finale against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.\nRay’s return has set up a possible quarterback controversy going down the stretch, especially after head coach Scott Milanovich has stated over and over again that Harris is the No. 1 quarterback.\nEven Ray said this week that his arm wasn’t 100 per cent, and he didn’t want to speculate on when, or if, he could return this season. Ray only got off the injury list on Labour Day and has been a backup ever since.\nWith the Argos having clinched a playoff berth and Harris struggling for the second game in a row, this was a perfect time to see what Ray has left at age 36.\n“(Milanovich) just wanted to get me some reps,” Ray said. “It’s been a long time. It felt good to get out there and try to get into a rhythm a little bit. I felt like I was able to put the ball pretty much where I wanted to, which is good . . . I didn’t play perfect, but I felt like my arm felt decent tonight.”\nEarlier in the game, Harris had thrown his league-leading 18th interception of the season. In almost three quarters of play, he was 11-of-14 for 102 yards.\nHarris was playing behind a banged-up offensive line that featured two Americans who were playing in their first CFL game. He was sacked three times in the first half alone.\nMilanovich would not discuss next week’s quarterbacking decision, although he admitted Ray “looked pretty sharp.”\nHarris said he wanted “to keep battling and fighting” when he was taken out but he was also supporting Ray.\n“I don’t play for me,” he said. “Whatever role I’m given I’m going to buy into 100 per cent . . . I’m going to be behind coach Milanovich no matter what.”\nThe Als, behind a strong outing by journeyman quarterback Kevin Glenn, got off to a 25-2 first-half lead. Glenn finished 27 of 35 for 294 yards and three touchdowns before he was replaced by Anthony Boone late in the fourth quarter.\n ", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:05:47.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
