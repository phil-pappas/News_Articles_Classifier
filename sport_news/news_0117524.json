Umberger was a full participant. \nUmberger missed the last two games with an upper-body injury but is now healthy and ready to return. Gagner, who was scratched in back-to-back games for the first time in his career, replaced Umberger and has a goal and an assist in the two games since. \n“I feel like I should be playing,” Gagner said. “I feel like I’ve played well, so I want to be in there helping the team. That’s my mindset. I just want to be in there focusing on the next game.” \nThe next game will indeed be Tuesday for Gagner. He’s playing on the left wing of Scott Laughton’s line with Brayden Schenn on the right side. \n“I feel good there,” Gagner said. “I feel good on the right, too. I think being versatile is important. I feel like I can play any of the three positions.” \nThat’s life on the Flyers, where all but two of their 14 forwards have spent significant portions of their hockey careers playing center. Gagner is one of those natural centers and spent a good portion of his offseason learning the left wing just in case the Flyers asked him to play there. \n“I think he’s played hard,” coach Dave Hakstol said. “He’s created offense on most nights when he’s been in. He’s done a good job on the power play, running that unit off of the half wall. I think he continues to work on his complete game in all three zones. Those are things we’ll continue asking him and other guys to do.” \nIt looks like Umberger, who prides himself on being an ironman, is on the outside looking in. The forward, who came back to the Flyers last summer via a trade with the Columbus Blue Jackets, took extra skating following Monday’s practice and will likely be a healthy scratch when the Dallas Stars visit the Flyers Tuesday. \n“I spent most of my career not missing any games,” Umberger said after Sunday’s practice. “In Columbus I didn’t miss many at all. It’s always tough to be injured and not be able to help your teammates, especially this early in the season. It’s kind of a freak thing for me. Hopefully it’s one of the things you put past you and go back to what you were doing before.” \nFirst he’ll have to get back in the lineup. \n“I think we continue to have some pretty good internal competition,” Hakstol said. “I think R.J. has gone through two days fully healthy now and feeling good. You’ll see him back in the lineup soon.” Who’s in goal? \nConventional wisdom suggests that after a five-day layoff, Steve Mason may have gotten the starter’s net back from the hot hand in Michal Neuvirth, who may have cooled off during the downtime. \nHakstol wouldn’t confirm who would be between the pipes, but Mason said he wouldn’t be surprised if Neuvirth got to continue his shutout streak of 132:05 and counting. \n“Michal deserves to play,” said Mason, who was away from the team for most of last week dealing with a family medical issue. “He played two real solid games, and he did his job. If he were to play (Tuesday) it wouldn’t change anything for me. I just have to keep working hard for whatever that game is.” \nConventional wisdom also suggests that the goalies would split Tuesday against Dallas and Wednesday in Boston considering it’s a back-to-back scenario, but Hakstol wasn’t forthcoming on that either. \n“I’m not sure how these games are going to shake out,” Mason said, “but those are situations you don’t even focus on. You take what you’re given, and you work as hard as you can to play well in those games. If it was a back-to-back or every other day and that changed the schedule a little bit, I’m not sure. You just work to prepare for every game that you play.” Loose pucks \nOnly ticket holders who purchased the specific “Jakub Voracek Bobblehead Package” will be eligible to receive Voracek’s bobblehead Tuesday night. … Tuesday night will be the first of 14 back-to-backs. \nDave Isaac: (856) 486-2479; disaac@gannettnj.com .
