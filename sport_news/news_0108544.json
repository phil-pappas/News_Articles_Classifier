It's all good.\" \nScott's account of the meeting was only slightly more encouraging. \n\"We talked in the NASCAR hauler at Dover to try to put the on-track incident and stuff like that behind us so we can race as professionals,\" Scott said. \nSo is that actually going to happen moving forward? \n\"I feel like we'll race each other hard just because of the incident and the feelings that linger afterward,\" Scott told FOXSports.com at CMS, site of Friday night's XFINITY Series race. \nAsked if anything good came from the meeting, Wallace was terse and cynical. NASCAR places Bubba Wallace, Brian Scott's wife on probation \n\"Sure,\" the Roush Fenway Racing driver said. \"We had a meeting. NASCAR's happy.\" \nScott, who twice confronted Wallace after the race to express his frustration over late-race contact, avoided being penalized for his actions. The same was not true for wife Whitney, who NASCAR placed on probation through the end of the year for her actions toward Wallace. \n\"It's NASCAR responding to an incident and responding to things that they hear,\" Scott said of the penalty against his wife. \nWallace received a matching probation for his role in the post-race run-in, which reached a boiling point when he allegedly called Scott's wife a disparaging name. \nAlso involved in the fracas was Brian Scott's motorhome driver, who NASCAR suspended indefinitely. \nWas Wallace surprised that Brian Scott wasn't also penalized for his role in the incident? 'Bubba' Wallace, Brian Scott spat gets ugly, spills over to Twitter \n\"No, not really, but, hey that's NASCAR-driven,\" he said. \"I don't call the penalties. Props to them.\" \nScott, meanwhile, remains less than remorseful about taking issue with Wallace after the two drivers tangled on a late restart. \n\"I felt like I was in the tire tracks of all the other cars,\" said Scott, who finished 13 th , four positions behind Wallace. \"I restarted on the bottom, I don't feel like I came up any higher than any of them, and I felt like he tried to pinch me off and he took my arch away from the corner and when I went to arch into the corner, he had me pinched down and he didn't give me the lane that is the customary bottom lane, and after that we got a right-front wheel that shook loose and it ruined our day when obviously we had led like 50 laps. \n\"Up to that point I thought we had a car in contention, so that frustrated me more than a normal racing incident because I felt like we had a good car and a car capable of winning.\" \nA day after being penalized, Wallace apologized on Twitter to his team, but didn't mention Scott or his wife. \nWhat prompted his apology? \n\"Be the better man,\" Wallace said. \"I'm trying to let it pass by, not keep talking about it.\" \nAnd least that's one thing that Scott and Wallace seem to be able to agree on. \n\"It is what it is,\" Scott said. \"I mean, NASCAR did what they felt like they needed to do, and we'll just focus our energy on moving on.\" 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:48:01.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
