Texas turns to Hamels 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Toronto\nThe Texas Rangers have won their past 11 games started by Cole Hamels .\nThey needed each of those victories to get this far, and their season will be over without another one Wednesday against Toronto in the decisive Game 5 of the AL Division Series.\n\"It's why you go out and get top performers, elite competitors ... situations exactly like this,\" manager Jeff Banister said Tuesday. \"That's a comforting feeling that we've got a guy on the mound that's going to go for us that has been here, has done it, and is quite capable of continuing to do it.\"\nHamels, the 2008 World Series MVP , will be pitching in a winner-take-all game for the first time when he goes against Blue Jays right-hander Marcus Stroman in a rematch of Game 2 of the ALDS. The Rangers won 6-4 in 14 innings Friday when both starters pitched seven innings and departed with the score 4-4.\n\"Who else would you rather have on the mound when you have to win a game than your ace?\" catcher Chris Gimenez said. \"The fact that he has been there before is really, I think, the biggest confidence boost.\"\nAstros -Royals: The Royals traded away three top prospects to acquire Johnny Cueto for the playoffs, even though his winning pedigree has been established almost entirely in the regular season. He'll have an opportunity to change that Wednesday night in Game 5 of the AL Division Series against the Astros. The Royals forced the decider at Kauffman Stadium by rallying from a four-run deficit in the eighth inning Monday at Houston. The Astros will counter with Collin McHugh , who threw a gem in winning the series opener.\nUtley appeal: A source told The Associated Press that Chase Utley 's appeal hearing on his two-game suspension for his rough slide that broke Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada 's leg has been scheduled for Monday. If the Dodgers' postseason is over at the time of the decision, any suspension that is upheld would be served at the start of the 2016 regular season.", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/23/8787171/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/41/23/8787171/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:22:40.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
