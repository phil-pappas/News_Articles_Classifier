Pleasant 7 The Middletown Cavaliers improved to 5-2 on the season, winning their second straight game Friday night in a 36-7 win over Mt. Pleasant. Kedrick Whitehead led the way for the Cavaliers finding the end-zone three times in the Middletown victory. Whitehead scored from two-yards out to tie things up at 7-7. Then, Vincent DelPercio gave the Cavaliers the lead just before the half on a five-yard quarterback keeper and Middletown led 14-7. Late in the third quarter Whitehead found the end-zone again for Middletown to give the Cavaliers a 21-7 lead. Just minutes later, Middletown took control for good off an Ernest Washington 70-yard interception return for a touchdown, and the Cavaliers led 29-7. Before the quarter was over, Middletown forced another Mt. Pleasant turnover, and capped it off with another Whitehead score. The Cavaliers are back in action next Friday night when they host local rival Appoquinimink at 7:30 p.m. St. Georges Tech 20, St. Mark’s 16 St. Georges Tech improved to 6-1 on the season, winning their sixth straight game on Friday night over St. Mark’s 20-16.
