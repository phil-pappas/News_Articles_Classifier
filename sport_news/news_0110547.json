The ensuing four-run deficit in the first and 8-3 loss to the Mets, not so impressive.\n“It was good,” Epstein said of the show. “Didn’t work. But it was good.”\nClose enough to perfect\nSlugger Kyle Schwarber, who hit 21 homers in 259 big-league at-bats, including playoffs, will continue to catch part-time and get a lot of playing time in the outfield next season, Epstein said.\nThe club still considers Schwarber a possible regular catcher at some point, even if the lack of regular games there might slow that development.\n“Is it imperfect development if he’s doing both [positions]? I’d say it is,” Epstein said. “But when the alternative is sticking that kind of a bat in the minor leagues until he’s Johnny Bench defensively, I like the imperfect path.”\nNotes: Right-hander Dan Haren, the veteran starter the Cubs acquired at the trade deadline, announced on his Twitter account after Wednesday night’s game what he had suggested since the trade: He is retiring. … Epstein on being the hot team in the playoffs (at times in Boston) and losing to the hot team (in this case the Mets): “It’s a great feeling when you’re the tidal wave. It’s not so great when you’re the dinghy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:53:58.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
