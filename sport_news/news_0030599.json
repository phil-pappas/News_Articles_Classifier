It’s very vexing right now. … That’s what keeps me up at night.\" \nIn 1989, the movie \"Back To The Future Part II\" traveled forward in time to 2015, with a prediction that this would be the year the Cubs win the World Series. Now that they’re only eight wins away, it’s understandable that Lopez — a sci-fi lover — is pulling for them to break through. \nAs for the Dodgers, don’t be too offended Mets fans: Lopez was born and raised just outside of Los Angeles. \nLopez’s rooting for the Tigers isn’t a passing craze. For years, he’s been seen wearing a Tigers cap in the locker room. But there’s an interesting story as to how he became a fan. \n\"We played the [video] games when we were little,\" Lopez said. \"Triple Play Baseball and all that stuff on [Sega] Genesis. My brothers would pick the Dodgers and the Giants, and so I looked for a team that I wanted to be. And there was one named the Tigers, and so I picked them. Perfect logic.\" \nShane Larkin has the closest tie to baseball of all the Nets. His father, Barry, was a Hall of Fame shortstop for the Reds from 1986 to 2004. But Shane hasn’t been watching too closely. \n\"Not that much, until the World Series,\" Larkin said. \"But I’ve followed it a little bit. … I feel like I’d be pulling for the Cubs, just because they have the super-long streak of not even being in the playoffs. Just to be back and to have all the rookies and the young guys that they’ve got, [it’s] kind of like the Royals from the other years. So I’m pulling for the Cubs right now.\" \nOver the summer, forward Willie Reed threw out a first pitch at a Royals game. On Wednesday, however, the Kansas City native couldn’t watch his beloved Royals in their pivotal Game 5; he was on the court at the time. He said he wouldn’t check the score until after his game finished. \n\"I’m going to be focused,\" Reed said. \"But I hope they win.\" \nJoe Johnson, however, didn’t have any such worries. He’s more of a football guy. \n\"The only thing I know about baseball,\" said Johnson, a massive Dallas Cowboys fan, \"is that it’s nine innings.\" \nEmail: vasqueza@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:52:38.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
