We have yet another twist in San Diego’s stadium saga. On Wednesday the San Diego Stadium Coalition announced it has jumped on board with a “Pay Their Own Way” Citizen’s Initiative. The idea is to fund a new stadium in Downtown San Diego for the Chargers, as well as an expansion to the Convention Center, without using any money from the taxpayers. The idea is to raise the city’s Transient occupancy Tax (TOT) from 10.5% to 15.5% (slightly less for smaller establishments), putting San Diego on par with cities like Seattle (16.5%), Los Angeles (15.5%) and San Francisco (16.25%). This 5% increase would eliminate a 2% fee on hotel-room bills already collected by the Tourism Marketing District. On Thursday attorney Cory Briggs, who authored the initiative, will hold a news conference to launch a signature gathering drive. The intent is to get enough citizens to sign it to put the initiative on the ballot for a June, 2016 vote. The San Diego Stadium Coalition has set up a GoFundMe page $50,000 for the signature drive. Briggs and a group of investors will then match that with another $50,000. There are a few interesting points in the fine print, not the least of which is the initiative would effectively outlaw an contiguous Convention Center expansion. Briggs has been outspoken in his desire for a non-contiguous Convention Center plan and will actually be in court with the City on the matter starting November 6. (you can read the entire initiative here ) Briggs has recently been successful in his legal challenges to keep Convention Center expansion away from the bayfront and may have a strong ally in JMI Realty, owned and operated by former Padres owner John Moores. JMI has also advocated for a non-contiguous Convention Center, instead pushing for a spot like the Tailgate Parking lot currently used for events at Petco Park. So many of you now may be thinking …“Great where does that leave the Mission Valley proposal?” I’m glad you asked. Also on Wednesday Governor Brown signed off on streamlining the process at the site of the current home of the Chargers. “The Qualcomm Stadium Reconstruction Project,” wrote Governor Brown, “will create new jobs, reduce energy usage and use clean energy, and promote infill development.” What that means is the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) proposed by Mayor Faulconer can be fast-tracked, moving straight to appeal court and potentially avoiding long delays, something the NFL has been concerned about when considering San Diego's case to keep a franchise. The Draft EIR received only 18 public comments, a shockingly low number for a project with this high of a public profile, with only two of them being what is considered “professionally prepared.” Now the Mayor’s stadium proposal can be placed on to a ballot in 2016, as well, providing the issues that have been raised are adequately dealt with. It is worth noting that responses that might have presented issues, from state and federal agencies like the Regional Water Quality Control Board and the California Department of Fish & Wildlife, never surfaced during the EIR process. The most researched responses came from entities based in Los Angeles. So it appears we now have dueling stadium proposals again, but this time both of them are in the city of San Diego instead of one being in Carson, and now both have at least the potential to get on the ballot for voters to decide on in 2016.
