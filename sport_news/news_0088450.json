Image 11 of 11 Burnt Hills' running attack helps Spartans pull away from Green Tech 1 / 11 Back to Gallery Burnt Hills\nGreen Tech came to Burnt Hills looking for the biggest win in the five-year history of its football program.\nWhile the Eagles fell short against the state's second-ranked Class A team, Green Tech battled hard for four quarters before the determined and efficient Spartans' ground game took control as Burnt Hills battled for a 21-6 win in a meeting of Northwest Division unbeatens Friday night.\nMike Leveroni rushed for 148 yards and a touchdown and Joshua Craig added 101 on the ground as Burnt Hills (5-0, 3-0 Northwest) rushed for 212 of its 280 yards on the ground in the second half.\n\"Green Tech is outstanding as you saw tonight and it took everything we had,\" Burnt Hills coach Matt Shell said. \"We had to make a few adjustments. We had to make a few tweaks with our blocking scheme. The kids ran hard, they knew they were going to get hit and yards were at a premium.\"\nThe first half was a defensive struggle until late in the second quarter when Jacob Shippey returned an Eagles punt 29 yards to the Green Tech 28-yard line with less than a minute to play.\nOn the next play, Spartans quarterback John Clayton spotted Joseph Braun open on the post for the game's first score.\nIn the third quarter, following a fumble recovery by Milton Lovelace, Green Tech (4-1, 2-1) turned a fourth-and-nine situation into its first points of the night. James Holmes connected with Raki Johnson on a 23-yard touchdown pass with 8:01 left to draw within 7-6.\nGreen Tech went for a two-point conversion and Holmes was stopped just short of the right pylon by Zackery Agan to preserve the Spartans' lead.\n\"I really just wanted to make sure he didn't get inside me and keep stringing him to the outside,\" Agan said.\nAs the second half wore on, the Spartans' rushing attack began to gain large chunks of yardage and controlled the clock.\nBurnt Hills ran 55 plays to Green Tech's 31 and took a 14-6 lead when Clayton took the ball over from the 1-yard line one play after hitting Leveroni on a swing pass that gained 15 yards on fourth-and-seven from the Eagles' 16-yard line.\nGreen Tech mounted a rally on its next possession but its drive ended when Agan intercepted Holmes' pass to Johnson at the Burnt Hills 8-yard line.\nLeveroni accounted for 66 of Burnt Hills' 92 rushing yards on the ensuing drive, capped by his 14-yard touchdown run with 2:41 left in the game.\n\"This is the toughest I've ever seen Green Tech play,\" Leveroni said. \"They have a great group of kids and they've got a coach they believe in. The opportunities are endless for them. Our line are unsung heroes for every game.\"\nEagles coach Travis Wood was upbeat despite the loss.\n\"Both sides were hitting, I'm so proud of my guys,\" Wood said. \"Everyone wanted to see if we could stay with the best in the state and we just showed we can play four quarters with anyone. Just a couple of big plays.\"\nSean Martin , a local freelance writer, is a frequent contributor to the Times Union .", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/53/8731385/7/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/54/8731392/7/628x471.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/53/8731389/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/53/8731390/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/56/8731531/5/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/53/8731389/7/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/53/8731386/7/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/53/8731388/9/628x471.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/53/8731391/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/53/8731385/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/53/8731387/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/53/8731390/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/53/8731384/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/53/8731390/7/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/56/8731531/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/54/8731392/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/53/8731388/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/53/8731384/7/628x471.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/53/8731387/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/54/8731392/7/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/53/8731387/7/628x471.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/53/8731386/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/53/8731384/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/53/8731391/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/53/8731386/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/53/8731388/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/53/8731389/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/53/8731391/7/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/53/8731385/7/628x471.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/56/8731531/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-03T08:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:24:31.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
