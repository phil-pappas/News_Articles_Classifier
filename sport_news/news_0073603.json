David Teel Contact Reporter David Teel #Hokies are bad and getting worse after 17-13 loss to #Pitt \nBLACKSBURG — Frank Beamer said little to his players late Saturday afternoon, even less to the media. And what he did say was terse. Little wonder. \nBeamer's Virginia Tech football team is bad, getting worse, and he knows it. He knows youth and injuries aren't excuses for fundamental breakdowns on both sides of the ball. He knows Hokies faithful and his bosses will demand better and that failing to improve could have dire consequences. \nTech lost to Pittsburgh 17-13, and the margin did no justice to the Panthers' superiority. \nThe Hokies gained 100 yards, their fewest since managing just 60 in Beamer's debut game as head coach, a 22-10 home loss to Clemson in 1987. Tech yielded seven sacks, matching its aggregate from the season's first four games, and rushed for 9 yards, the fourth-lowest of the Beamer Era. \nAlarming as those numbers are, as physically overmatched as the offensive line was, Saturday wasn't solely about the offense's shortcomings. \nA week after East Carolina backup quarterback James Summers shredded them for 169 yards rushing, the Hokies allowed a 26-yard run by Pitt reserve quarterback Chad Voytik on the second play, jump-starting a drive that led to a Panthers field goal. Trailing 10-7 at halftime, Tech watched redshirt freshman Qadree Ollison rumble 43 and 25 yards on consecutive off-tackle plays to start the third quarter, the latter producing the contest's final touchdown. \nThe 2015 Virginia Tech football season in photos. \nNo wonder Beamer's postgame team gathering under the stands was so brief. No wonder he was a mite salty in the interview room. \nBeamer didn't swear, pound the podium or raise his voice — he never does. But you could tell. The Hokies are 2-3, 0-1 in the ACC, after consecutive losses to ECU and Pitt and are proficient at absolutely nothing. They have a short week to prepare for Friday's visit from North Carolina State and are in danger of their first 0-2 ACC start in 12 seasons of membership. \n\"We're going to look closely at some personnel,\" Beamer said. \"We're going to look carefully at how we're doing some coaching.\" Bud Foster describes Pitt's long runs \nVT defensive coordinator blames missed assignments for gains of 43, 25 yards to open second half. \nVT defensive coordinator blames missed assignments for gains of 43, 25 yards to open second half. See more videos \nI suggested to Beamer that Ollison's runs to open the third quarter were nothing more than routine off-tackle plays. \n\"That's what it looked like to me, too,\" he said. \"It's poor gap responsibility. Both sides of the ball. It's lapses. It's not consistent play. It's not what we normally have around here. Like I said, we're not staying where we are. We'll look at it.\" \nFollowing up, I asked Beamer if it was fair to call him angry, for even in defeat he usually preaches the positive. \n\"No, I'm not very happy,\" he said. \"If you're happy to see the team come out in two plays and score after halftime — no, I'm not happy.\" \nEspecially since it's more of the same. Tech has allowed 13 runs of 20-plus yards this season, more than any power conference team. \nThe 17-7 deficit after Ollison's touchdown felt insurmountable as Pitt's defensive front, led by end Ejuan Price and middle linebacker Matt Galambos, dominated. The Panthers (3-1, 1-0) not only sacked Motley seven times but also pressured him into three interceptions. \nTake away the 57 yards lost in sacks, and Tech still only rushed for 62 yards on 26 attempts. Jet sweeps from Travon McMillian have become cliché, while J.C. Coleman, Trey Edmunds and Sam Rogers are finding no room between the tackles. \n\"What happened was simple,\" offensive coordinator Scot Loeffler said. \"You didn't run the ball well, you got your quarterback hit and the next thing you know your quarterback's not making great decisions.\" \nWhen Joey Slye kicked a 43-yard field goal early in the fourth quarter, the Hokies were in position to poach a game they had little business winning. All they needed was a touchdown. \nHere's how their final three possessions went: \n•Motley threw a duck directly to free safety Terrish Webb. One play, no yards. \n•After Vinny Mihota's blocked field goal gave Tech possession at its 25, Cam Phillips dropped a pass, Rogers rushed for a yard, and Price sacked Motley for a 10-yard loss. Three plays, minus-9 yards. \n•Following a Panthers punt, the Hokies took over at their own 38 with 3:25 left, but Motley was sacked for back-to-back losses of 8 and 7 yards. He threw incomplete on third down and was picked on fourth. Four plays, minus-15 yards. \nThose remaining among a crowd of 49,120, Lane Stadium's smallest since 1998, voiced their displeasure, and it wasn't because they were cold from sitting in the rain for three-plus hours. It's because the Hokies are 2-8 in their last 10 home games versus Bowl Subdivision opponents and are in the midst of a fourth straight mediocre, at best, season. \nThen it was Beamer's turn, vowing immediate evaluation of schemes and players. The last time I recall seeing him so irritated was after the January 2011 Orange Bowl beatdown from Stanford. \nSoon thereafter, Beamer overhauled his staff, hiring Cornell Brown and Shane Beamer, moving veteran assistants Billy Hite and Jim Cavanaugh into administrative rolls and shifting play-calling duties from Bryan Stinespring to Mike O'Cain. \nWithout exponential improvement, the changes after this season could be far more drastic. \nDavid Teel can be reached at 757-247-4636 or by email at dteel@dailypress.com .
