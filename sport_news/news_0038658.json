Macomber in the 71st minute. Then, with just 1:05 left on the scoreboard, Marion was awarded a penalty when a Giant attacker and a Berry defender clashed for a loose ball in the box. \nMarion's Isaiah Fuller scored the penalty and Marion was up 2-1 with 65 seconds left to play. Logan had one chance late but Manuel Ramos' hopeful long shot went over the goal with four seconds left. The Giants emerged with a 2-1 victory and a date with Kokomo in Saturday's final. \n\"I'm like the boys, I'm devastated that we didn't win that,\" Logan coach Mike Turner said. \"I thought we owned that game. The possession, I thought we owned the better looks, better opportunities.\" \nThe Berries didn't have much time to recover after giving up the go-ahead penalty. \n\"The coach from Marion said the same thing, he said 'that was a horrible call, coach,'\" Turner said of talking to Marion counterpart Jorge Berry after the game. \"In the last minute, you don't make that call. That's two guys fighting for the ball and their guy hit the ground. That was a tough way to get beat.\" \nIt was also difficult to watch the Berries lose the lead down the stretch. \n\"That's kind of what's happened to us all season when we hit the magic 10 minutes,\" Turner said. \"We have lost five games this year, and this is the sixth, in the last ten minutes of games. We were winning and we give up two goals or three goals to lose.\" \nLogan had the better first half, outshooting Marion 6-4 but had nothing to show for it and the teams went into halftime tied 0-0. Logansport took a 1-0 lead on a penalty kick of its own in the 60th minute. Ramos worked to keep possession and tried to dribble his way into the box on the left side, drawing a push from behind. \nRamos converted the penalty and the Berries were up a goal. It was their only reward of the night after some good attacking moves ended in saves for Marion goalie Caleb Oliver or shots high or wide. Oliver had five saves in the game. \n\"We had great opportunities and a couple seniors even, they had their shots,\" Turner said. \nLogan goalie Kevin Gonzalez had four saves. The Berries finished their season 6-10-2. \n\"I'm proud of their effort,\" Turner said. He talked about the team's improvement over the course of the year, something that develops during the season as few Berries play travel soccer. \"It takes us all season to get there, but at the end of the season we're always there.\" Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:04:12.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
