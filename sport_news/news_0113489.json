But he did recently, when he recalled his Epsom Derby triumph in June aboard Golden Horn.\n“When I got to the furlong marker and I knew I was going to win, these enormous emotions…” he said, pausing before adding, “It’s very hard to explain.”\nThat 236th running of the Derby at Epsom in England will long be remembered as Dettori’s own. Before that, his most recent Derby mount had been in 2011, and in between his career had seemed headed off the rails. The champion Italian-born jockey had ended his 18-year association with the Godolphin Stable in the fall of 2012, and soon after he tested positive for cocaine in France.\nWhen he returned to racing in 2013 after a 6-month suspension, he was written off in some quarters. But, Dettori said, “To finish my career like that wasn’t my plan.”\nContinue reading the main story Related Coverage Special Report: Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe: Longchamp Revamp Splits French Racing OCT. 2, 2015 Special Report: Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe: A Filly’s Date With History OCT. 2, 2015 Golden Horn’s victory was a declaration of the jockey’s return to the top. He punched the air as the bay colt, clear of the runner-up Jack Hobbs, stretched for the finish. Later, before the cheering crowd of 125,000, Dettori leapt off the horse in his trademark dismount.\n“I’ve had a colorful life and I’m not finished yet,” Dettori, 44, said after the race, before he and John Gosden, Golden Horn’s trainer, were greeted by Queen Elizabeth II. But Dettori was pressed for time: He was scheduled to ride at Lingfield Park Racecourse in Surrey that night. “I said, ‘Excuse me, ma’am, but I have to go to Lingfield,”’ he recalled of his exchange with the queen.\nThree hours later, he won again, before a crowd of 7,644, — Lingfield’s largest since at least 1989 — aboard an odds-on maiden for the Al Shaqab Stable of Sheikh Joaan al-Thani.\n“It was on the way home anyway, so it wasn’t a big deal,” Dettori said of the back-to-back racing.\nThe tight schedule would seem to be more fitting for a 21-year-old trying to prove himself than for a 44-year-old who has won more than 200 Group 1 contests and practically every major race around the globe. But since his suspension ended in May 2013, he has at times seemed to be a man on mission.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story On Sunday, Dettori returns to the scene of his failed drug test: the Longchamp racecourse in Paris, where he will ride Golden Horn in the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe. His assignment — to stop Trêve ’s historic bid for three consecutive victories — is loaded with intrigue.\nSheikh Joaan , who lifted Dettori from his malaise by hiring him as his stable rider in late 2013, owns Trêve.\nIt was Dettori who was supposed to ride Trêve in the 2013 Arc. But the jockey broke his ankle only days before, and then watched the filly’s tour de force triumph in tears. Their reunion last year ended in bitterness: After two defeats, Trêve’s trainer, Criquette Head-Maarek , lobbied to have Dettori replaced by Thierry Jarnet, the filly’s previous rider.\nTrêve had been fighting foot and back problems, but she recovered and won a second Arc as Dettori watched from atop the also-ran Ruler of the World. It was a setback for the jockey, but not enough to derail his comeback.\n Dettori is one of the few jockeys in the world who has reached celebrity status. In addition to his sporting exploits, he has appeared on the British reality TV show “Celebrity Big Brother” and the BBC quiz show “A Question of Sport.” He also owns Frankie’s Sports Bar and Diner in London and has pitched Jockey yogurt and a line of frozen Italian food. Used to spending all that time in the public eye, he was impatient during his suspension.\n“My wife says I’ve got bipolar because sometimes I’m happy, sometimes I’m not, and I’ve got the concentration span of the flea,” he told The Guardian in May. “She’s got a point — I’m often up and down.”\nIn a profession where an ambulance is always present in the workplace, nearly every jockey encounters tragedy at some point. Dettori is no exception, although in his case it was not on the track. In 2000, a small plane in which he was traveling crashed in England. The pilot was killed, but Dettori and the other passenger, Ray Cochrane, a jockey at the time and now Detorri’s agent, escaped with minor injuries. But Dettori has experienced few difficulties on the racecourse.\nDettori grew up on farmland near Milan, the son of a champion jockey, Gianfranco Dettori, and a mother who rode horses in the circus. His riding ability and flair for the big stage came from them. At the age of 14, he left school and his father sent him to England to train as an apprentice jockey. He turned professional at 16, but it was his time spent in the United States, Dettori said, that molded him into a true success.\nDuring four English winters, Dettori rode at Santa Anita Park, near Los Angeles. Mounts were hard to come by until his final spell, but he watched and learned from outstanding jockeys and trainers. In 1989, the jockey Angel Cordero told him to ride with his toes in the irons, not his feet, as was then the customary style in Europe. He learned to crouch low in the saddle, especially in the stretch, to minimize the drag.\nBack in Europe, punters noticed his unique style and his peers copied it. In 1990 and still a teenager, Dettori won 100 races in one season. In both 1994 and 1995, he won more than 200 races.\nIn 1994, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, signed Dettori for his Godolphin operation. On a single July afternoon in 1996, the young jockey won all seven races at Ascot. In 2000, the sheikh’s horse Dubai Millennium, with Dettori aboard, won the Dubai World Cup in record time .\nAs fate would have it, although Dettori had long since parted with Godolphin, his old employer inadvertently opened the way for him to ride Golden Horn. In November 2014, Sheikh Mohammed, after a poor season in England, settled on William Buick and James Doyle as his retained jockeys. Gosden often used both, so he turned to Dettori. (He had also regularly used the Italian before he had joined Godolphin.)\nDettori won with Golden Horn in April. But a month later, in the Group 2 Dante Stakes, he rode Jack Hobbs, another Gosden colt, while Buick was on Golden Horn, who won again. Dettori seemed set to ride Jack Hobbs in the Derby, until Godolphin bought a piece of Jack Hobbs. So Buick and Dettori traded horses.\nWinning the Derby was the best moment of his career, Dettori said, adding, “When you get older you understand the importance of a race like that.”\nHe turns 45 in December, but he sounds as if he is closer to the start than the end of his celebrated career.\n“It’s been my life for 30 years, and I absolutely love it,” he said. “We are quite selfish as sportsmen because we get all this emotion and glory, and nobody can really understand that. My goal is to enjoy as much as I can for as long as I can.”", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/03/sports/horse-racing/03iht-srprtreve03/03iht-srprtreve03-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/03/sports/horse-racing/03iht-srprvenue03-1/03iht-srprvenue03-1-thumbStandard.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T14:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:31:00.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
