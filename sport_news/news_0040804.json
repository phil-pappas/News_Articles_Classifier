Hingle, USA TODAY Sports)\n4 CONNECT 29 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE IRVING, Texas – Dallas Cowboys quarterback Brandon Weeden says he feels more comfortable after two consecutive starts this season, even as owner Jerry Jones calls him “limited” and cites Weeden as one of the reasons why the Cowboys lost both games.\nWeeden, who is starting in place of the injured Tony Romo, said on Wednesday that he was unaware of Jones’ comments but that “it still doesn’t mess with my psyche. … Yeah, I would say there’s a lot of things I can’t do that Drew Brees can do. All I care about is finding a way to give our team a chance to win. I don’t care what my limitations are or aren’t, or what Drew can do or what Tom (Brady) can do or the next guy can do.”\nWeeden completed 22 of 26 passes in the 39-28 loss to Atlanta on Sept. 27 but coach Jason Garrett said there were some opportunities missed on the outside in the passing game. In the 26-20 overtime loss Sunday at New Orleans, Weeden completed 16 of 26 passes for 246 yards and engineered a late-game, 91-yard touchdown scoring drive to tie the game.\nUSA TODAY\nBrennan: Greg Hardy remains unapologetic, yet will be cheered on Sunday\nAfter Sunday's loss, Jones said Weeden “does some real good things, though it’s not quite apples and oranges when the guy on the other side of the deal is Brees and you are dealing with a guy who is as limited as Weeden.”\nThen on KRLD-FM radio in Dallas on Tuesday, Jones said “when you look at the second half of our game against Atlanta and then you look at really the second half against New Orleans, you’ve got to include Weeden in the reason why we didn’t win the game.\n“You don’t have to in any way point the finger and say, ‘You don’t have Romo, you’ve got him.’ I’m going to have to give it a bigger, ‘You don’t have Romo.’ That’s who is on the other side of the line, Brees, who was limited with the shoulder but basically knew how to pick us apart and take advantage of a tired defense.”\nWeeden has now lost 10 straight games as an NFL starter, dating to his tenure with the Cleveland Browns. Already without injured wide receiver Dez Bryant, the offense will now miss running back Lance Dunbar, who suffered a season-ending knee injury against the Saints, and wide receiver Brice Butler, who is sidelined with a hamstring injury.\nUSA TODAY\nNFL owners look to expand international games, possibly to Mexico and Germany\nGarrett said the coaching staff has more confidence in Weeden after two consecutive starts and specifically praised his command at the end of the Saints game.\nWeeden assumed outside criticism intensified this week, but he says he’s long been inactive on Twitter, which enables him to tune out criticism.\n“I remember the people that talked crap never had a picture of themselves,” he said. “It was some cartoon or something and it was always probably a 12-year-old kid who damn sure never played quarterback, who damn sure never played quarterback in the NFL. I don’t need that kid telling me, ‘What the hell (are) you thinking throwing to this guy?’\n“I’m 32 years old. I don’t need a 12-year-old telling me how to play quarterback.”\nFollow Eric Prisbell on Twitter @EricPrisbell .\nVIDEO PLAYLIST: LATEST FROM THE NFL Los Angeles in spotlight at NFL owners meetings | 01:36 USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero explains everything that happened at the NFL owners meetings Wednesday.
