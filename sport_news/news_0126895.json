But we'd like to have some fun with the past, keeping in mind that it can be hard to know where you're going if you don't know where you've been.\nThat may be a Quote: from a Bill and Ted movie . It's hard to remember and we don't want to Google it. (WYLD STALLYNS!)\nBut we digress. Today, Vintage Oregon starts a new historical quiz that challenges readers to guess the present-day locations of photos from the Portland area's past. We're talking decades and decades before the dual monstrosities of the Portland Building and Bono prancing around in gaudy, ever-present shades .\nIn the coming months, we'll offer up new quizzes with new locations.\nHave fun.\nAnd may you never glorify the past because the future has dried up.", "external_links": ["http://alexcastle.net/2014/02/14/bono-is-historys-greatest-monster/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/hCCOn132jNQ", "http://app.contenttools.co/trivia/1076/embed.js?show_name=yes&show_description=yes&show_sharing_options=yes&show_cover_image=yes"], "published": "2015-10-08T13:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:57:41.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
