More from KY3 \nTom Szczerbowski /Harry How/Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images \nThe Blue Jays starter gave up just one run on three hits as Toronto defeated Kansas City 7-1 in Game 5 of the ALCS. The two teams will play in Game 6 Friday night at Kauffman Stadium. \nThe Blue Jays started the scoring with a solo home run from Chris Colabello in the second-inning. Toronto then exploded for four runs in the sixth-inning. The big hit came off the bat of Troy Tulowitzki. Toronto added a run in the seventh and eighth-innings. \nSalvador Perez' home run in the eighth-inning got the Royals on the board. \nEdison Volquez took the loss for the Royals. \n---- \nHere's a blog on the game (times are Eastern Daylight Time): \n1:05 p.m. \nManager John Gibbons knows do-or-die games this year. His Blue Jays trailed the AL Division Series 2-0 then won three straight to advance. The task is more daunting now, trailing the Royals 3-1 in the best-of-seven set. But his club could look no further than its own history for some motivation: Toronto led Kansas City 3-1 in the 1985 ALCS and lost. \nGibbons said in his pregame talk, David Price, Aaron Sanchez, Roberto Osuna and even R.A. Dickey, who threw only 48 pitches Tuesday in Game 4, are all available. \n---- \n1:10 p.m. \nRoyals catcher Salvador Perez has taken a beating this series, with fouls hitting off his mask, collarbone and one right below the Rawlings gold label - only for Gold Glove winners - on his chest protector, and that was just in Game 4. During the ALDS he even underwent concussion testing. \nBut Perez gave a broad smile when he sat down in the pregame interview room and blurted out, \"I feel great today, guys! Thank you very much.\" \n--- \n3:11 p.m. \nOne loss away from elimination in the ALCS, the Blue Jays don't have $82 million catcher Russell Martin in the starting lineup against Kansas City's Edinson Volquez. \nDioner Navarro is behind the plate and batting seventh, because he's worked well with Toronto right-hander Marco Estrada. The pair teamed up in 20 of Estrada's 28 starts. \nMartin, who signed a five-year contract with Toronto last November. He hit .240 with a career-best 23 home runs and 77 RBIs this season. \nNavarro, who is in the final year of a two-year, $8 million deal, hit .246 with five homers and 20 RBIs in 54 games. \n--- \n3:45 p.m. \nIt's Oct. 21, 2015, the day Marty McFly traveled from 1985 to 2015 in \"Back to the Future II,\" and the Blue Jays were playing along. Just before the lineups were announced before Game 5, Huey Lewis and the News' \"The Power of Love,\" the song made famous in the first film of the series, played over the PA system. \nRoyals pitcher Jeremy Guthrie was photographed wearing a pair of sneakers that looked a lot like the self-lacing shoes that Michael J. Fox wore in the movie. \n---", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:57:07.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
