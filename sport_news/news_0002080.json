The 30-year-old is the first Briton to win the title on consecutive years \nUntil now, despite a Briton winning the drivers' championship on 15 occasions, a British driver had not won the title on consecutive years. \nThe win moves Hamilton joint fifth on the all-time championship list alongside revered names of the sport such as Ayrton Senna and Nelson Piquet. \nHowever, the 30-year-old still has a long way to go to catch F1's most successful driver, Michael Schumacher, who won seven world championships during his record-breaking career. \nHamilton's German teammate Nico Rosberg, who started on pole, had appeared on course to delay his title celebrations for one more race, but a costly late mistake while in the lead saw him finish in second place. \nFerrari's Sebastian Vettel took third place after fighting his way back from 13th. \nCelebrating his win, Hamilton threw his trophy in the air and caught it again. \nHe was congratulated on the podium by singer Sir Elton John who said: \"What a race!\" \nHamilton said: \"I can't believe you're here!\" \nThanking the crowd for enduring the rain to watch the race, he said: \"I think we put a good show on for you today.\" \nHe also paid tribute to his crew and his family saying: \"I love you all.\" \nBoxer Amir Khan tweeted: \"A big well done to @LewisHamilton on winning today and becoming world champion.\" \nFormer world champion Mario Andretti posted: \"Congrats Lewis @LewisHamilton well deserved race win and 3rd #F1world Title!!
