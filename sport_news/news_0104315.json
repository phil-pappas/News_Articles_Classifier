Friday night’s game against Edgerton was about the seniors getting a win on potentially their last home game ever, and the Cougars achieved that, too. Led by four touchdowns from Jordan Jones, the Cougars turned a 16-14 halftime lead into a 30-16 victory over the visiting Crimson Tide of Edgerton. After a shaky defensive first half, the Cougars put the clamps on in the second and earned a 5-4 record for the season. “It feels amazing to get this win on Senior Night,” said senior Mitch Vanderkooi. “It’s the greatest feeling in the world.” All eyes will be on Friday night’s seeding and playoff placement, which has suddenly become the norm for the Cougars, not the exception. Head coach Jeff Spiwak has created a culture where the playoffs are expected, not hoped for. “It’s nice to read the paper and it’s not on the front page any more,” Spiwak said of the team’s playoff berth. “We talk to people in the community and it’s not, ‘Holy cow, you made the playoffs.’ And that’s where we want to be as a program. It is an expectation. We’ve been there three years in a row now and we expect to never be out of the playoffs moving forward. Now we have to take that next step and win a game or two.” The Cougars started early Friday with Jones scoring his first touchdown on the game’s third possession after the teams exchanged fumbles on the first two. Jones capped off a 7-play, 64-yard drive with a 7-yard score, making it 8-0 Cougars. For the past two weeks, Jones has been the best player on the field for the Cougars or really anybody else in the RVC for that matter. With Peyton Pope injured, Jones has stepped up in a big way. He rushed for 299 yards last week and went for 177 against the Tide. The Cougars needed someone to fill in for Pope, their leading rusher, and suddenly the Cougars have two elite backs. “I think he’s finally healthy and up to speed with what we are doing,” said Spiwak of Jones. “He’s a speedy kid, and it takes him a lot to get to 100% physically and he’s finally there. He isn’t coming off the field right now that’s huge for us. He’s really stepped up the last two weeks and was a leader for us on offense.” The offensive line has had a lot to do with Jones’s success as well and they know they just need to give Jones a chance to get into space. “We (the offensive line) have been playing together as a team rather than a solo act the last few weeks,” said Vanderkooi. “By doing that, we’ve been able to get Jones out in the open.” After Edgerton pulled to 8-7, the Cougars scored again after an Edgerton fumble, this time on a punt. The muff gave Clinton new life on the Tide 35 and Jones scored from 18 yards on fourth down, making it 16-7. Edgerton pulled to 16-14 near the end of the half, but was never any closer. The Tide fumbled the opening kickoff of the second half and Clinton scored five plays later when Jones scored from 20 yards out. Jones added one more score from 21 yards out and also had two interceptions, giving him eight picks on the year. The second half defensive effort had a number of contributors, including Cole Ciochon getting two sacks and seniors Jaks Teubert and Garrett Pass making plays in the backfield, but nobody may be more important to that defense than sophomore linebacker Connor Mullooly, whose steady play has been invaluable to a team that has seen plenty of turnover at the linebacker spot. “He’s been great,” Spiwak said. “He kind of just goes about his business and you don’t really notice him until you see 15 tackles on the stat line.” Spiwak was also quick to credit senior Guillermo Aceves, who had to step in for an injured Robert Billington three weeks ago. “I think Guillermo deserves a lot of credit,” said Spiwak. “He’s been thrust into a starting spot three weeks ago and gets better each week. I think we will watch film and see he did some nice things for us.” • NOTES: To see where the Cougars play, check out the Beloit Daily News Sports Blog with all the playoff dates and matchups.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:49:35.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
