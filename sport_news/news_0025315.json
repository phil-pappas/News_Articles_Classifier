Either Greinke or Jake Arrieta of the Chicago Cubs is expected to win the National League Cy Young Award.\nGreinke was 1-1 in the postseason, yielding five runs (including three homers) in 13 1/3 innings. He was the losing pitcher in Game 5 of the NLDS against the New York Mets.\nGreinke has not commented on whether he is likely to opt out of his current contract.\n  Dodgers give Greinke record deal Dodgers' Greinke out 2 months with broken collarbone Dodgers' Zack Greinke undergoes collarbone surgery Zack Greinke, Los Angeles Dodgers edge Madison Bumgarner, San Francisco Giants", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:00:39.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
