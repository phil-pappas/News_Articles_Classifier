Kapur had two birdies, three bogeys and a double for his 75.\n\nChawrasia shot 77 at par-72 Kingbarns after starting with a birdie. But he struggled thereafter with a bogey on 14th, a quadruple on 16th and another bogey on 17th to turn in four-over 40. The second stretch had two bogeys and one birdie for a total of 77.\n\nJeev playing at St Andrews had no birdies and dropped no less than five bogeys for a 77.\n\nMeanwhile, Walker Cup stars Paul Dunne and Jimmy Mullen got their professional careers off to scintillating starts with rounds of 64 to take a share of the lead alongside Swede Kristoffer Broberg on the first day.\n\nDunne's opening effort included a hole in one on the 15th at Kingsbarns, one of the three fantastic venues hosting this week's festival of links golf on The European Tour.\n\nMullen took full advantage of the perfect scoring conditions to notch eight birdies and an eagle to join Dunne and Broberg, who was playing at St Andrews - on eight under par.\n\nAt Carnoustie, traditionally the hardest of the trio of courses, home hero Marc Warren continued his solid season to post a four under par round of 68.
