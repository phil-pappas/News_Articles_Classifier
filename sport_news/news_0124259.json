Chief Minister Harish Rawat took this decision at a meeting with officials of the Cultural Department here today. Rawat said Ramlilas were an integral part of the hill culture and tradition and a working plan would be prepared to promote them. He announced Rs 1 lakh for more than 100-year-old Ramlilas, Rs 75,000 for Rs 50,000 for 100-year-old Ramlilas and Rs 50,000 for 25-year-old to 50-year-old Ramlilas being staged in various parts of the state. He gave directions that cultural programmes be organised at Jageshwar, Tehri and Dehradun on the completion of 15 years of state formation on November 9. Cultural programmes should not be confined to the capital city of Dehradun and this year, the programmes would be dedicated to the culture of Uttarakhand, Rawat said. It was decided to host competitions concerned with traditional foods and culture of the state. These programmes would be organised at Jageshwar and Almora on November 6, at Tehri on November 7 and at Dehradun on November 8. Winners of these competitions would be awarded during the state-level state formation day function at Dehradun on November 9. The craftsmen of the state and winners of “harela” and “jhumelo” competitions would also be awarded on the occasion. Similarly, participants who presented outstanding tableaus on Janmashtmi would also be awarded at a function in Haridwar. Ramlilas begin in Kumaon With the start of Navratras on Tuesday, Ramlilas also began in the Kumaon region. Ramlila was first organised at Almora in 1860. It was staged by Pt Devi Dutt Joshi, a resident of Dania town. “From 1860 to 1890, Ramlila used to be staged at the Badreshawar temple. Later, it was organised at Jakhan Devi, Laxemswar, and Chinakhan,” said Pradeep Rawat, a local resident. He said Ramlila then proceeded towards Bageshwar, Nainital and Pithoragarh. “Haldwani was the first town where Ramlila was organised during the day time. It was started by Pt Ramchandra Bashisth, a Kathavachak pundit from Mathura,” he added. According to sources, Kumaoni RamliIlas are highly influenced by Pt Udai Shankar, who had reached Almora in 1936. The Udai Shankar Cultural Centre started experiments with Ramlila and used shadow effects. The staging of Ramlila in Pithoragarh began in 1897. It was first organised by Deputy Collector Devi Dutt Joshi. “Ramlia in Pithoragarh has struggled a lot to reach the present position. However, the tradition of singing in various ragas of classical music continues today,” said Jagdish Punera, secretary of the Ramalila Committee, Pithoragarh.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:10:24.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
