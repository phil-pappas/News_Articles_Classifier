Image 43 of 43 For Kawhi Leonard, the goal is more championships nothing more 1 / 43 Back to Gallery It seems like yesterday when Kawhi Leonard hoisted the 2014 NBA Finals MVP award after helping the Spurs win their fifth championship.\nAlmost a year later, Leonard was in the spotlight again, being named the 2014-15 NBA Defensive Player of the Year. One would think Leonard, like other NBA stars around the league, would desire more recognition.\nMaking the All-Star team? First Team selection? League MVP?\nRELATED: Work never stops for Spurs' new $94 million man\n\"I just want (another) one of those up there,\" Leonard said, referring to one of the championship banners hanging from the Spurs' practice facility.\nLeonard, 24, has little concern with individual accolades.\n\"In 2014 I wasn't an All-Star or Defensive Player of the Year,\" Leonard told the Express-News. \"If I can get back and win a championship, that's what I'm trying to do.\"\nSpurs coach Gregg Popovich wasn't surprised Leonard's motivation stems from pursuing a championship.\n\"That sounds like him,\" Popovich said. \" ... He really is more interested in winning than he is with (individual awards). He's a really selfless kind of guy. ... It's not about him in any way, shape, or form. It's always been about the group.\"\nIt's this type of attitude that supports the notion Popovich will be around for a few years after the Big Three dismantle. With Leonard, and now LaMarcus Aldridge added to the mix, Popovich doesn't worry about character issues, just basketball.\n\"I've always said I've been fortunate with the guys I've had come through here,\" said Popovich. \"My job is pretty easy when people have that character and you don't have to convince them to get over themselves, convince them to be happy for their teammate's success, or to feel responsible to each other. (Leonard) already feels all that. He understands it when we talk about it. It makes it easier to have a team that enjoys playing together.\"\nRELATED: Spurs headline ESPN's Ultimate Standings\nBut who could doubt Leonard if he did have MVP aspirations, or if making an All-Star team was a goal?\n\"I'm not one of the guys in the league for the fame,\" Leonard said. \"I'm here so I can take of my family, my mom, my friends and take care of myself. I love the game of basketball and as long as I can do that, keep playing and try to get some more championships with the organization, I'll be happy. I don't care about winning an MVP – the MVP doesn't mean you're the best player in the league.\"\nAsked if that attitude comes from any of the conversations with Michael Jordan, whose brand he's signed to, Leonard said: \"It (comes from myself). When I was little ... I was just trying to help my team win championships (in high school and college). I wasn't really a guy that wanted to be the MVP. I was just trying to standout for myself.\"\nThe attitude is there, and now it could be time to see Leonard utilized on both ends of the court more frequently. His defensive abilities are well-known, but for the past few years the talk is how the Spurs will incorporate Leonard more on the offensive end.\nThere were a few sneak previews last season. Remember that season-high 11-game winning streak? Leonard led the Spurs in scoring four times during that span, averaging 19.2 points, 6.1 rebounds, 2.1 steals and shot 56.1 percent from the field (45.2 percent from three). Add to that the fact the Spurs were 19-3 when Leonard scored 20 or more points.\nWhen discussing the plan to get Leonard more involved on offense, Popovich killed the notion that Leonard will be the centerpiece, reminding of the \"equal opportunity\" system, but did explain how the transition to use Leonard more is in progress.\n\"You have certain guys you go to,\" Popovich said. \"Manu (Ginobili), Tony (Parker), and Tim (Duncan) were the three guys for most of their career. It shifted a little bit – it shifted from Timmy to Manu and Tony. You don't take it away from the former (completely), but now it shifts a little bit towards Kawhi, a little bit towards LaMarcus. But you can't forget about Timmy, Manu and Tony.\"\nOne area the Spurs may use Leonard more this season is in the post. Leonard has worked on that area of his game last few years, while still learning to become a perimeter threat. He took a career-high 93 shots last season from the right side of the post/paint area (shot 44.1 percent). With Aldridge – usually working the left block – and now Leonard, the Spurs' post game could be stronger than in recent years.\nSaid Popovich: \"We're going to put (Leonard) in the post more and more, so he's got to learn what his go-to moves are, what he feels comfortable with and the type of (defenders) that are going to come after him (while in the post). Just like they came after Timmy early in his career, they'll go after Kawhi. They're not going to let him go one-on-one down there. He's got to figure out how to adjust, how to take advantage of that, and basically learn how to be a quarterback. That's what he's doing.\"\nIt all sounds great: Leonard hungry for more titles, Popovich hoping to make him more of a two-way player, all of it. But time will tell how it unfolds.\nMake no mistake, though, Leonard is more motivated than ever to help the Spurs coordinate another championship run, while at the same time becoming a more dominant player.\n\"That drive is back this year,\" said Leonard. \"We got a lot of good pieces and we're a little bit better than we were last year talent-wise. We just have to build our team chemistry back in order to get to that (championship level).\"\njyoung@express-news.net\nTwitter: @Jabari_Young", "external_links":
