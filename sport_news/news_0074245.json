The intensity of the overtime, I just ran to the ball, the defender and the keeper collided, and I just flicked it in.\" \nGosselin now has 43 career goals, besting the previous mark of 39 held by former Eagles player and coach Dave Storey. Gosselin has 18 of those goals this season, the most of any player in Carroll. \nThe FSK senior put his team ahead 1-0 a little under 17 minutes in, scoring on a header. Liberty (5-5-2, 4-2) responded quickly, however, as Jon Danko tied the game 1-1 less then four minutes later. \nAfter Gosselin gave the Eagles a halftime lead, the Lions again fought back, as Tony Cirri tied the game less than five minutes into the second half. \nFSK goalie Ethan Rhoten made several of his 12 saves in the final 10 minutes, helping to preserve the tie and force overtime. \nAnd when it was time for the extra period, Haines wasn't surprised to see who lifted his team to the victory. \n\"At the end of the game, [Gosselin] said, 'Listen, I can take these guys on the back side. I can take their defenders,'\" Haines said. \"He said that, and he did it.\" \nThe Lions could've clinched a spot in next Monday's county championship game with a win. South Carroll has already won the Cowan Division, and will face either the Lions or Westminster for the county crown. \nIf Liberty beats Manchester Valley, it will play the Cavaliers. But if the Lions lose to the Mavericks, the Owls will take on SC. \n\"We've had a lot of ups and downs this year, so that's up to them,\" Liberty coach Dave Abarbanel said. \"If they want to play, they can be a very successful team. If they don't, then it will be a short end to their season.\" \nMonday's win possibly helped the Eagles in terms of playoff seeding in the Class 2A West region, as well as helped them build some momentum going into the postseason. Tonight, FSK wraps up its regular season at Frederick, looking to win for the fourth time in five games entering the playoffs. \n\"Us coming in, stepping up and beating them is huge for us,\" Gosselin said. \"I'm proud of these guys and we really stepped up.\" \nGoals: L-Jon Danko, Tony Cirri; FSK-Jake Gosselin 3. \nAssists: L-Michael Williams; FSK-Wilfredo Flores 2. \nSaves: L-8 (Justin Brookhart); FSK-12 (Ethan Rhoten). \nHalftime: FSK, 2-1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:05:08.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
