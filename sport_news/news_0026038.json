The Trojans defeated Hoosier Hills Conference champion Columbus East (13-5) in Thursday’s second semifinal, 2-1. \nFloyd Central senior Sean Brown says he and his teammates expected to get this far in the state tournament. \n“It’s not surprising. It’s our goal to make it as far as possible,” Brown said. “We’ve worked [hard] all season to get to this point and hopefully get further.” \nFloyd Central, which won its third consecutive Class 2A Floyd Central Sectional title last Saturday, competed in the Class 2A Washington Regional the past two years. In both of those regionals, the Highlanders got knocked out by perennial power Evansville Memorial. In 2013, Floyd Central lost to the Tigers in the regional final, 1-0. The Highlanders fell in the regional semis to Memorial last season, 3-0. \nAfter launching several shots on goal in the first 19 minutes and 51 seconds of the game, the Highlanders finally broke through the Spartans’ defense. \nJunior Landon Campbell curved in a shot from 20 yards in the right side of the goal to put Floyd up 1-0. The Highlanders’ lead could have easily been 2-0 as Brown had a goal a minute earlier get negated by an offsides call. \nHowever, Connersville (14-5-1) deadlocked the game at one later in the half on a strange sequence. \nFloyd Central goalkeeper Jack Parker tried to kick the ball to a teammate in the box. But instead of getting the ball to a fellow Highlander, Parker’s boot went to Spartan freshman Luis Guerrero. The Connersville forward immediately kicked the ball into the left side of the goal with 5:41 remaining in the half. \nAt halftime, Floyd Central thought it had several opportunities to take a commanding lead. The Highlanders outshot the Spartans on goal 14-2 in the first half. \n“I think they got a little frustrated in the first half when we got all those shots,” Floyd Central head coach Tim Rice described his players’ emotions at intermission. “Sean missed three or four goal opportunities in the first half that he’ll never miss again in his life. That changes the course of your psyche a little bit. I think they expected to be up a little bit more in that first half. \n“We talked to them before the game about the Battle of Little Big Horn. If you underestimate your opponent, you’re going to get killed. You don’t want this to be your Little Big Horn.” \nLike they did in their two sectional games, the Highlanders got an early goal in the second half. \nJunior Brodey Zink intercepted a pass from a Connersville defender and placed the ball into the left side of the goal in the 42nd minute to give Floyd Central a 2-1 lead. \nBrown had an opportunity to increase the Highlander advantage with 31:33 remaining in regulation. \nThe Spartans got whistled for a handball violation in the box, setting up a penalty-kick attempt for Brown. The Floyd Central midfielder tried to kick the ball in the left side of the net. But Connersville goalkeeper Garrison Cole dove to his right and stopped the ball with both of his hands. The Spartan sophomore made eight saves. \n“He had a hell of a game,” Rice said about Cole. “In the first half, he made some great saves. The save on the PK certainly kept them in the game. Some of that was us playing right to them and not getting our heads up and finding [the keeper]. But they’re a high-pressure team in their backfield and their defending third.” \nConnersville tied the game at two with less than 17 minutes left in regulation. Guerrero delivered a long cross pass on a free kick to teammate Stephen Keaffaber. The Spartan senior received the cross by making a header to Connersville junior Sam Griffin, who executed a header of his own to deadlock the score. \nThe Highlanders started their three-goal barrage after that. \nFloyd Central took the lead for good in the 65th minute when senior forward Keaton Jacobi knocked in a short-range goal off a Campbell assist. \nBrown put the Highlanders up 4-2 with 13:26 remaining with a goal off a Jacobi assist. \n“We started settling down instead of rushing it. We were a little rushed in the first half,” Brown said. “We started putting some passes together and finding pockets and sitting in pockets. We were just finding ways to open them up.” \nNinety-seven seconds later, Campbell got his second goal of the game when he connected on a score after receiving a corner kick from Jacobi. \n“We talked to them about being patient and letting the game kind of come to them,” Rice said. “I can’t explain it. I don’t know that I’ve ever been involved in a game where it is that tight, then all of a sudden the floodgates open, especially with one that means as much.” \nFloyd Central will be vying for its first regional championship Saturday, while East Central will try to capture its seventh regional title. \nCLASS 2A COLUMBUS NORTH REGIONAL \nSEMIFINAL \nFLOYD CENTRAL 5, CONNERSVILLE 2 \nConnersville 1 1—2 \nFloyd Central 1 4—5 \nSCORING SUMMARY \nF — Landon Campbell, 20th minute. \nC — Luis Guerrero, 35th.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:13:49.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
