Mandatory Credit: Chuck Cook-USA TODAY Sports (Photo: Chuck Cook, Chuck Cook-USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nMETAIRIE, La. - Saints head coach Sean Payton says that Quarterback Drew Brees is expected to play in the team's Sunday night game with Dallas. \nPayton made the announcement at his daily media availability Friday. \"“I think he’s planning on it. I think we’re planning on starting him. Based on the work week, and the reps, he’s thrown well. Yes, I thought he looked sharp today,” Payton said. Drew Brees surprises two inspiring Saints fans on 'Ellen' \nBrees bruised his shoulder two weeks ago in a loss to Tampa on a hit from the Bucs defense. \n“I think all of that has gone real well and look, the diagnosis was never a tear, I’ve read that, the diagnosis was what it was,\" Payton said of Brees' road back to starting. \"Obviously, you know when you’re going to throw and it gets caught, there’s a torque. It stresses that joint, but the rehab has gone well and you know how he is with being meticulous and attention to it and all of that. It’s encouraging.” \nHe sat out Sunday's loss to Carolina, but was back - in a limited role - at practice this week. \nAsked if Brees return could provide a lift or spark to the ailing Saints, who are winless at 0-3, Payton said, “I think the spark doesn’t necessarily come from the QB. I think the spark comes from all the players understanding and executing their assignment. Certainly there is a sense of urgency in a game like this, when we’re sitting there in an early hole like we’re in. So we just finished talking about it. It’s up to each player to get up and be ready to play and execute the scheme.” \nThe game Sunday was the first one Brees had missed as a Saint due to injury. \nIn addition to Breesm Keenan Lewis, Jairus Byrd and Dannell Ellerbe were listed as probable for the Sunday night game against Cowboys.
