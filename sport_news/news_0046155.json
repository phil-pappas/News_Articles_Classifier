Let me just put on record that the person who organised this match and started the process of this match is one Mr. Totto. \n\"He was introduced to us by the Sports Minister Dr. Mustapha Ahmed himself. Four days before he spoke to that radio station in Kumasi, we wrote a letter to the Ministry as a reminder. So it came to us a huge surprise that the Deputy Minister would say this.\" \nGhana will play Canada in Washington DC today (Tuesday) at the RFK Stadium. \nKick off is 11:30 pm local time. \nFor more sports news visit allSports.com.gh", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:08:35.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
