Chip Kelly never claimed to be a defensive whiz. So don’t blame the Eagles head coach for allowing Kirk Cousins — Kirk Cousins for crying out loud! — to march Washington 90 yards over 15 plays and the winning touchdown.\nIs there a worse time to be a Philadelphia sports fan? The Phillies stink, the 76ers are still tanking and the Flyers … OK, nobody cares about hockey. And now the Eagles are 1-3 in a bad NFC East following Sunday’s 23-20 loss.\nKelly’s team was shut out in the first half. They have a field goal kicker who doesn’t kick straight and a running back, DeMarco Murray , who doesn’t get the ball.\nAnd yet, all the Eagles had to do was stop Kirk Cousins , who doesn’t exactly have a Joe Montana -like history of fourth-quarter comebacks. Kelly played his part by electing not to use any of his timeouts in the final two minutes even though it was clear that Washington would either turn the ball over on downs or score before time ran out. So why not give yourself a chance by leaving at least one minute on the clock?\nThis all goes back to Super Bowl 49 when Bill Belichick refused to stop the clock on the Seahawks’ final drive. The Patriots got lucky; Malcolm Butler had the interception for the ages and the game clock wasn’t a factor.\nBut the Patriots are the Patriots. They are battle-tested, well coached, well quarterbacked and lucky, not to mention they’ve clearly made a pact with the devil. The Eagles are none of the above. Instead, Kirk Cousins’ touchdown pass left Kelly, Sam Bradford and the Eagles 26 seconds to play with.\nHey, but at least they had those three timeouts.\nEvan Habeeb/Getty Images The Eagles have no answer to stop Kirk Cousins during Washington's final fourth quarter drive. OUTTA LUCK\nIf the NFL is, like everybody says, a quarterback’s league and the second most important team employees work on medical staff, how come a shoulder injury to Andrew Luck — he didn’t play in the Colts’ 16-13 overtime win against Jacksonville — doesn’t generate the attention and fear it deserves.\nJust think about how everybody reacts when a star pitcher is forced to skip a start. And they get 30 of them. Luck only has 16 games and he’s already missed one and maybe more.\n“We worked him out Saturday morning, and we were hopeful he could come in (Sunday) morning . . . we were going to evaluate him and see how he felt and he just wasn’t ready,” Colts coach Chuck Pagano said. “Didn’t have the arm strength and all that stuff.”\nThat doesn’t sound good, right? In fact, Luck may not be available for Thursday’s game at Houston. Luck’s replacement, 40-year-old Matt Hasselbeck , became the oldest quarterback to start an NFL game since Brett Favre (41) in 2010. And his team won.\n HERE\nSAY WATT?\nOnce upon a time, J.J. Watt was an MVP candidate. Well, at least for some people he was. On Sunday, the Houston Texas’ defensive end was on the wrong side of a 48-21 beatdown courtesy of the undefeated Atlanta Falcons. Was a Lawrence Taylor team ever beaten this badly?\nDoesn’t mean Watt’s a bad guy. He’s definitely a huge talent. But an MVP candidate? No.\nHouston, which was featured on HBO’s Hard Knocks during the preseason, fell to 1-3 in a game where quarterback Ryan Mallett was replaced with Brian Hoyer after the Falcons built a 42-0 lead. Hoyer was originally replaced by Mallett after losing the season opener.\nFYI: Undefeated division rivals Carolina and Atlanta don’t meet until December when they’ll play twice over 14 days.\nHOLD THE LIVER, JOE\nThere was a high-profile coach fired in England on Sunday and it wasn’t Miami’s Joe Philbin .\nLiverpool sacked its manager Brendan Rodgers following a 1-1 draw to crosstown rival Everton. Philbin appears to be hanging on by a thread following a 27-14 loss to the Jets at London’s Wembley Stadium.\nTim Ireland/AP A coach was fired in England on Sunday and it wasn't Joe Philbin. That should come soon, though. “I’m worried about getting this team straightened out and fixed and getting our team ready to play the Tennessee Titans,” said Philbin, whose team has been outscored 91-48 during their three-game losing streak.\nThere have been various reports that the Dolphins will be looking for a new coach within a few days.\nPERFECT KNICKS\nDenver is the NFL’s weakest 4-0 team and Arizona is the best 2-2 team anywhere.\nThere are times when Rex Ryan sounds like Donald Trump . “Everything will get better because I say so.”\nIt’s been a while since the Mets, Jets, Yankees and Giants were all playing this late into October. Come to think of it, the Knicks are the only undefeated team of the group.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:18:56.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
