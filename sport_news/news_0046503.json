Wyckoff native Morgan Hoffmann, 26, made his debut at The Masters en route to retaining his PGA Tour card. Wayne’s Marina Alex, 25, secured her LPGA card by making the cut at all five majors.\nOradell’s Jim McGovern, head pro at White Beeches, excelled during his freshman season on the senior circuit. McGovern, 50, won the New Jersey Senior Open in May and qualified for the U.S. Senior Open and British Senior Open.\nFranklin Lakes’ Trevor Randolph became the first Bergen County resident to win the Bergen County Amateur since 2000. Randolph, 42, followed that September victory later in the month by winning the Metropolitan Golf Association’s Mid-Amateur.\nHall, in his first full season back in Wayne after a decade playing mini-tours, won the New Jersey Open in July in a seven-stroke runaway. He was runner-up at the Met Open in August.\n\"It’s been a great year,\" said Hall, who leads Mackey by four points in the Assistant standings, 533-529. \"I’ve been very fortunate to have played well.\"\nMackey has joined the Garden State’s top tier. He tied for 12th at the New Jersey Open. He won the NJPGA Assistant Championship in August. At last month’s final of the Assistant Season Long Match Play, he topped Hall on the first playoff hole.\n\"It’s all very exciting, and it’s nice to have been pretty consistent this season,\" said Mackey. \"It’s probably the best I’ve played in quite some time.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:15:23.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
