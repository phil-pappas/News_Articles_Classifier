But considering what she’s been through over the past year, her ability to do such things on the soccer field is downright remarkable. \nToy returned to high school soccer this season after battling back from lumbar spinal fusion surgery, which she had on Oct. 21, 2014. \nFittingly, Toy was interviewed about her spirited comeback on Wednesday, which was the one-year anniversary of the surgery. \n“One year ago,” she said before recounting her ordeal. \nToy had the surgery after getting hurt in a game against Linganore. After getting hit that night, she went down and couldn’t feel her legs. She already had previous back problems, which she battled back from, so she was flown to Johns Hopkins Hospital. \nShe had been playing soccer since she was 4, with her father Tony being instrumental in helping her hone her skills, but her ability to continue participating in the sport on any level was suddenly in doubt. \n“Once I got hit at Linganore, I thought I was done. I thought I was actually paralyzed. I couldn’t do anything,” she said. “Then after I got the surgery, I was just so scared to get back into soccer.” \nAfter her surgery, she was laid up about nine weeks. To get around, she had to use a wheelchair or crutches. The recovery was rough, and she said she got “lazy” at times. But eventually, she got motivated. \n“The smallest things got me really happy,” she said. “So I would be able to walk down the stairs and then the next thing I knew, I wanted to jog or run. It was small steps.” \nEventually, she started playing offseason soccer, although not at the high level she used to compete as a former ODP player. She said her mother Stacy helped her each step of the way. \n“She was just determined to play soccer and to rehabilitate and get back to it,” Stacy said. \nThe rehab was arduous. \n“I had to go two or three times a week for a couple hours a day,” she said. “I would work on my legs and my arms and my chest, especially my core. I had to work on everything to make my back stronger.” \nDoctors said Toy could play again. And despite being a little nervous when she started preseason practice with the Titans, she said her comeback got a major boost from the motivation provided by her Titans coaches and teammates. \n“I still have rough days. I’ll wake up feeling really sore or aching. I won’t want to get out of bed,” she said. “But then I’ll get out to practice, I’ll get out to games and I’ll be really confident because I’m able to do what I love doing most.” Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:20:30.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
