There was the infamous goat in 1945.\nAdChoices That black cat in 1969\nSteve Bartman in 2003.\nToday, that Chicago Cubs curse just happens to be Daniel Murphy, who’s personally trying to extend their torturous history.\nThe New York Mets, 4-1 winners behind Murphy’s latest heroics, are now two victories away from shattering the Cubs’ dream season, taking a 2-0 lead in the National League Championship Series.\nRELATED: Mets beat Cubs for 2-0 NLCS lead\nThe Cubs have gone 70 years since winning the pennant, 107 years since winning the World Series title, and now themselves facing yet another historical obstacle.\nJust once since the NLCS went to a best-of-seven format has a team overcome a 2-0 deficit - 1985, when the St. Louis Cardinals won four consecutive games against the Los Angeles Dodgers.\nThe series resumes Tuesday at Wrigley Field, and for the Cubs to reach the World Series, they’ll now have to beat the Mets four times in five games, while facing the best young pitching staff in the game.\nGood luck, fellas.\nThe Cubs can curse the Mets’ young stable of starting pitchers all they want, but there’s no man more responsible for their predicament than Murphy, who shares the same name of that goat who was banned from Wrigley during the 1945 World Series, if you’re looking for irony.\nCome on, you wouldn’t expect anything less, would you?\nMurphy is turning this postseason into a free-agent showcase, hitting a first-inning home run that virtually iced the game before the crowd could buy their first hot chocolate, in a game that started with a 45-degree temperature, and dropped into the 30s.\nMurphy, who hit three homers with five RBI and scored five runs in the Mets’ NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, isn’t cooling off.\nThe dude homered for the fifth time in seven postseason games, including four consecutive games, setting a franchise record for most postseason home runs.\n“You know Mike Piazza is an all-time great with the Mets,” Murphy said after Game 2. “To have my name mentioned in that sentence is a very humbling experience.”\nHow stunning is Murphy’s power supply?\nHe has never hit five home runs in a single month during his entire career, and finished with a career-high of 14 this season.\nDaniel Murphy Career Batting | PointAfter\nYou want more strange-but-true fun facts?\nHis five homers all were hit off the three pitchers who will finish 1-2-3 in this year’s National League Cy Young balloting: Two off Clayton Kershaw and one off Zack Greinke of the Dodgers, and Chicago Cubs ace Jake Arrieta, who had the greatest second half in major league history.\nMurphy is the first player in history, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, to hit at least three postseason homers off pitchers with at least 15 victories and a sub-2.50 ERA during the regular season.\nPlease, don’t ask Murphy to explain it, he’s as much a loss for words as anyone who has been watching him throughout his season.\n“I was saving the homers, I guess,’’ Murphy said. “If I knew what I was doing, I would have hit more homers during the regular season.”\nPerhaps no one watching the latest proceedings was more stunned than Arrieta, who was 12-0 with a 1.18 ERA in his last 16 starts on the road.\nThis is a guy had given up only two homers and six runs in the first inning of his 33 regular-season starts this year, and hadn’t even given up a first-inning run since May 29.\nArrieta hasn’t given up three runs in the first inning since July 30, 2010, spanning 123 starts.\nYet, the Mets treated him as if they were facing a September call-up from the Miami Marlins, with the Mets’ first three batters producing a homer and three runs.\nArrieta, realizing he was facing the hottest hitter on the planet, threw a first-pitch 95-mph fastball past Murphy in the first. Arrieta came back with an 88-mph slider, and held his breath, when Murphy hit the ball into the right-field upper deck.\nFoul.\nArrieta just missed on an 0-and-2 slider, and came back with an 80-mph curveball. He whipped his head just in fast enough to watch Murphy hit a soaring shot into the right-field upper deck.\nThis time? Fair.\nThe Mets had a 3-0 lead, and the game was already over, except for the final lines in the box score, with rookie Noah Syndergaard refusing to give the Cubs any crazy thoughts of a comeback.\nSyndergaard, pitching on just two days’ rest after pitching in relief in Game 5 of the NL Division Series, showed little signs of fatigue.\nHe dazzled the night away, overpowering the Cubs with his 99-mph fastball, and leaving them flailing away with his changeup and curveball. Syndergaard permitted just one hit and two baserunners through the first five innings, before finally running out of gas with two outs in the sixth, and turning the game over to the bullpen.\nThe Mets managed only one hit after the first inning, with the Cubs’ staff retiring 17 consecutive batters until Murphy’s two-out single in the eight, but the damage was done.\nAnd Murphy’s stardom shining brighter than any time in his career.\n“He likes to be on the big stage,” Collins said. “Sometimes on this team, you can get overshadowed by all the stars that are here. There’s been a host of guys that have come through here, but Dan Murphy has been that one steady guy that you look up, he plays hard.”\nOnly now, everyone’s looking up, and seeing just how far he’s hitting that ball into the seats.\n2015 MLB playoffs Go to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfzaO5.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BBkkQsl&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://baseball-players.pointafter.com/l/11687/Daniel-Murphy", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfBj2k.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;baseball_mlb&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Top", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfByu5.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfCenF.img&quot;}}", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Schwarber", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Murphy", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyxle.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;David"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:47:05.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
