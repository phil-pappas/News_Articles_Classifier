Asani Samuels tied it in stoppage time for the Rhinos, then scored the winner in the 113th minute. 36 CONNECT 13 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nIt looked like it was over. \nThe L.A. Galaxy II led the Rhinos by a goal in the final minute of regulation and had appeared to have stolen the USL Championship at Sahlen’s Stadium. \n“I saw some people leaving,” Rochester midfielder Tony Walls said. “We were fighting for our lives.” \nThey’d done it all season. They never gave up. Not at home. Not on the road and they certainly weren’t going to do it with a championship on the line. \nAnd that’s why they were celebrating late Friday night after the most dramatic title win in the Rhinos’ 20-year history, as rookie forward Asani Samuels came off the bench to rescue Rochester. The 23-year-old forced overtime by scoring on a leaping header in stoppage time, then connected for the winner in the 113th minute – again on a header off a corner kick. \nIt gave the Rhinos a thrilling, 2-1 win, finally ending their 14-year championship drought and rewarding the 5,421 fans who showed up in rainy, cold weather. \n“We found a way all year. The mentality of the group’s been special. They fight for each other. I’m so proud of them,” said coach Bob Lilley, whose club capped a near-perfect season at home with a 15-0-2 record and finished 20-1-10 overall. “This was the biggest challenge. … (L.A.) pushed us all the way through, but we never gave up. This team has the heart of champions.” \nIt was the seventh league final in team history and ninth overall (Rhinos are 5-4 in those). They won A-League title matches at Frontier Field in 1998, 2000 and 2001 and lost championships in 1996 in Seattle, 1999 in Minnesota and 2006 at home to Vancouver, a team coached by Lilley. \n“It’s the best win that I’ve been a part of in my career,” said Lilley, 49, who started in the A-League/USL with Hershey in 1997. \n“It’s awesome,” Walls said. “Surreal.” \nSamuels, a 6-foot-5, 177-pound Canisius College product from Jamaica, called it the “best moment of my life.” He’d played just 183 minutes and scored only two regular-season goals. But Samuels had also connected twice in OT in a U.S. Open Cup win Harrisburg. Lilley called him a “secret weapon.” \n“His vertical (leap) is like 38 inches on those set pieces he’s a beast,” Walls said. \nL.A. (17-12-3), the affiliate of the Major League Soccer franchise by the same name, took the lead in the 65th minute off Bryan Olivera’s free kick. Daniel Steres and Bradley Diallo each beat Rhinos defenders to the ball and flicked headers. Diallo’s went off the cross bar after being tipped by goalie Brandon Miller and Lassiter, 21, the son of former MLS star Roy Lassiter, tapped in the rebound for his 15th goal. \nL.A. had won three straight road playoff matches to reach the final and led the USL with eight regular-season road wins. Now the young team nicknamed “Los Dos,” which ousted the Rhinos from the playoffs, 2-1, in last year’s quarterfinals, felt like it had enough to win. \n“It’s heartbreaking,” L.A. coach Curt Onalfo said, but complimented the Rhinos by adding, “quite frankly, their will to win or not to lose, I think, came through.” \nHere’s how unlikey the Rhinos forcing OT felt. They hadn’t registered a second-half shot until Samuels scored. \nHe replaced another rookie, Nate Bordeau, in the 80th minute. Bordeau, 25, was signed in late August just for depth, but he was pressed into action as the Rhinos’ injuries mounted. Bordeau came in for Mike Garzi (ankle) in the 35th minute. \nWith their top two scorers, Steevan Dos Santos (suspended) and Christian Volesky (concussion), sidelined, Samuels thought he’d get time off the bench. Lilley actually started team MVP Walls, his defensive midfielder, up top to try to press L.A., whose best first-half chance was an 18-yard free kick. Miller made a terrific punch on the Oivera’s follow-up volley from 17 yards. \n“We needed everyone tonight,” Lilley said. \nOn the tying goal, off Jonny Mendoza’s corner kick, Samuels leaped above the crowd and nodded it down and in from eight yards. On the winner off Kenardo Forbes' corner, he muscled off defender Tommy Meyer, using his arm to gain enough space to head the ball in from six yards. \n“Both plays were the same thing,” said Samuels, who celebrated the first goal with an acrobatic round-off and back flip \nL.A. lost goalie Clement Diop to a head injury after a collision with Rhinos forward Colin Rolfe, another substitute, in the 102nd minute. He was replaced by Bennett Sneddon, an 18-year-old making his USL debut. \nWould it have mattered on the winning goal if Diop was in there? Who knows. The Rhinos don’t care. They finished the job they had their sights on all season. \n“We had that belief, that faith that we had all year, that determination,” Walls said, “and we got it done.” \nJDIVERON@Gannett.com \nRhinos 2, L.A.
