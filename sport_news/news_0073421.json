He reached his century in spectacular style by lofting Devendra Bishoo over mid-wicket for his only six of the day.\nHe has also hit 10 fours after facing a total of 288 balls.\nAfter Sri Lankan skipper Angelo Mathews won the toss and chose to bat, Karunaratne vindicated that decision by putting on 56 for the first wicket with Kaushal Silva while frustrating the West Indies fast bowlers for 17 overs.\nSilva, who was tested by some probing fast bowling from Jerome Taylor and Kemar Roach in the first hour, fell before lunch when he edged to Denesh Ramdin off Roach for 17.\nVice captain Lahiru Thirmanne was next to go when he mistimed a lofted shot over mid wicket to be snapped up by the substitute fielder Rajendra Chandrika off Bishoo.\nHis dismissal continued a run poor form and he never looked comfortable during his 62-ball innings, hitting just one boundary in his score of 16.\nIt was otherwise hard going for the West Indies bowlers who frequently teased the batsman outside off stump.\nJerome Taylor was particularly unlucky to go wicketless and the visitors' fielding wilted under pressure as the humid day progressed.\nThirimanne and Chandimal were both dropped, the latter when he was only on 11 as Taylor failed to hang on while backpedaling near the boundary.\nWest Indies used seven bowlers with the spinners Marlon Samuels and Bishoo bowling 40 overs between the two of them.
