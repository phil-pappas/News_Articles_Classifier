In an effort to remain in the series, Beltre had a cortisone shot.\n\"Obviously we want Adrian in there,\" Banister said. \"He's the heart and soul of this ballclub.\"\nAfter going for tests at a hospital, Beltre returned to the clubhouse about an hour after the game and walked gingerly. An MRI confirmed Beltre had a strained back, but no structural damage, general manager Jon Daniels said.\n\"We haven't ruled him out of [today's] game,\" Daniels said.\nTexas will have Joey Gallo and Ed Lucas travel from its Arizona Fall League team in case Beltre needs to be removed from the roster, a decision that also would rule Beltre out of the AL Championship Series.\nBlue Jays manager John Gibbons said Donaldson, the AL MVP candidate, felt lightheaded while playing defense in the top of the fifth. \n\"They check for concussions, and apparently he passed all the tests. So that's good news,\" Gibbons said.\nJays slugger Jose Bautista hit a solo homer in the sixth, then left with a sore right hamstring. The team said Bautista is expected to play today.\nYovani Gallardo (1-0) allowed two runs and four hits in five innings. He is 4-0 with a 1.78 ERA in four career starts against Toronto.\n\"We got in some good hitter's counts and he wouldn't give in,\" Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin said. \"He didn't make those mistakes that we capitalize on.\".\nKeone Kela, Jake Diekman and Sam Dyson finished, with Dyson getting a save.\nPitching on 11 days' rest, Price (0-1) allowed five runs and five hits in seven innings. He dropped to 1-6 with a 4.79 ERA in 11 postseason games, and is 0-6 in six playoff starts.\nASTROS 5, ROYALS 2 (at Kansas City, Mo.) â€” Collin McHugh and Houston beat Kansas City at its own game Thursday night, relying on sharp pitching and stingy defense for a victory in the opener of their AL Division Series.\nThe ex-Met McHugh (1-0) allowed four hits, including a pair of solo homers by Kendrys Morales, while pitching around a 49-minute rain delay. The right-hander lasted six innings before turning over the game to his bullpen, which scattered three runners over the final three frames.\nGeorge Springer and Colby Rasmus went deep for the homer-happy Astros, but they also scored via the same sort of small ball the Royals used in reaching the World Series last season.\nYordano Ventura (0-1) yielded three runs on four hits and a walk in two innings for Kansas City, but didn't come back following the delay. Chris Young served up Springer's home run with one out in the fifth, but tossed four otherwise solid innings of relief.\nThe Astros, who struggled so mightily on the road this season, have apparently solved their woes just in time. They beat the Yankees, 3-0, in New York in Tuesday night's wild-card game, then took care of a Royals club built specifically for spacious Kauffman Stadium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:15:36.127+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
