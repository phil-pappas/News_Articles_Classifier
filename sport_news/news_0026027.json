And I said, 'Why don't you do what I tell you, or go talk to the president.'\"\nThe 72-year-old former senator also appeared to tacitly criticize Clinton's boast in a recent Democratic debate that she had made enemies with Republicans.\n\"I don't think my chief enemy is the Republican Party. This is a matter of making things work,\" he said.\nIn the carefully scripted world of Washington politics, his remarks are likely to be seen as casus belli by the Clinton camp.\nBiden also weighed in on the tenor of current politics, saying he followed the rule that it was appropriate to challenge an opponent's judgment, but never their motive.\n\"Today,\" he said, \"it's all about motive up there, it's not about judgment. 'You're a bad person, you really are not a good God-fearing man.'\"\n\"You can't get to 'yes' after I tell you 'I think you are dishonest, or you are in the pocket of the industry.' That's wrong.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:26:30.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
