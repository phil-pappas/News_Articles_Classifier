He then scored twice in the Vikings’ regular-season finale against Central Wisconsin Christian on Thursday, a 7-0 win. On the season, Clary has 22 goals and five assists for a total of 49 points. \nAll-time team sports achievement \nAdvancing to the Wisconsin State Cup as a member of the Appleton Soccer Club last summer \nNo. 1 athletic goal \nGetting recognized as an all-conference player in the Flyway Conference \nTravis’ thoughts \n“I like it when we play as a team. I’m more of a team player, I don’t really believe in the whole one-man team thing. I like playing with other players and getting more goals for the whole team.” \nCoach David Haag’s thoughts \n“Travis is a cliche. He’s a coach’s cliche. He’s our most-skilled player all-around and our hardest working player. He just loves soccer so much. He runs his guts out all the time, he’s very intense. He’s self-motivated. He doesn’t really need a coach. He’s self-coached. He plays a lot in the offseason, he gets guys fired up on the field. He doesn’t need to be encouraged to be intense or to work on things. He’s one of those guys that’s just a dream to coach because he’s highly skilled, he’s your hardest-working guy and he loves the game.” \nTravis’ favorites \n•Pro/college athlete: Professional soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo \n•Pro/college team: University of Wisconsin men’s soccer team \n•Musical artist: Fetty Wap \n•Song of all time: “300 Violin Orchestra” by Jorge Quintero \n•TV show: “Sherlock Holmes”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:00:40.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
