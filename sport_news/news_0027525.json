Megan, this is only her third varsity match and she was able to pull out the first set and that was huge for her confidence moving forward.\" \nKarpinski and Duhaney each won their matches 6-0, 6-0, while Forrest earned a 6-4, 6-2 victory in her third singles contest. \nThe doubles matches were a bit closer, although Verona still swept both games. Sophomore Julia Cambreleng and junior Michelle Lima defeated sophomores Eliese Walter and Haley Diess 7-5, 6-3 in first doubles. Seniors Amanda Gannon and Emma Francullo earned a 6-4, 6-3 victory over sophomore Elissa Johnson and senior Ava Kreismer in second doubles. \nDespite the 5-0 loss, Cedar Grove head coach Nick Mellina said he noticed some improvement from the last time his squad took on Verona. \n\"I'm pleasantly surprised. I'm proud that they're doing better than the first time we played them,\" Mellina said. \"It's great to see. It's nice to see them apply what we do in practice. It's always great to see growth in your players. As a coach, it's nice to see because it means you're doing something right.\" \nThe season is starting to wind down for both squads, but Thai said he still expects his team to play well moving forward. \n\"There's still some competitive matches coming up and I still want to see the girls compete and play at a high level,\" he said. \nKarpinski is nearing the conclusion of her final season with Verona and said she wants to go out with a bang. \n\"I just hope that we can win our last few matches,\" she said. \"It would be a good way to end the season like that.\" \nEmail: gewelb@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:14:30.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
