Tom Worgo Contact Reporter Towson Times \nAs the lopsided victories keep piling up, the No. 1 Gilman football team continues to shy away from the premature talk of a Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association A Conference championship. \nBut after Friday’s 48-7 victory over visiting and No. 7 Archbishop Spalding, the Greyhounds are forcing the issue. \nGilman (7-1) rolled up 42 points in the first half on a Spalding team that had given up only 41 points in its last five games — all victories. \n“This team certainly has to go down as one of the best team’s I have coached,” said Gilman coach Biff Poggi, who has won 11 A Conference titles in 18 years. “The defense is ridiciously good, the offense is tremendous and the special teams has been really good. It just has been a complete effort.” \nSenior running back Antonio Dupree led Gilman’s offense against Spalding. He rushed for two touchdowns and 125 yards on 12 carries to help his team run its winning streak to seven games. \nGreyhounds’ senior running back Dorian Maddox also rushed for two touchdowns, but Dupree has been a bigger part of the offense. Spalding vs Gilman battle of unbeatens \nGilman football rolls past Archbishop Spalding, takes control of MIAA A Conference. \nGilman football rolls past Archbishop Spalding, takes control of MIAA A Conference. See more videos \nThe 5-foot-10 Dupree now has 1,015 yards rushing and 10 touchdowns and boasts scholarship offers from Ohio State, Georgia, West Virginia, Iowa and Auburn. \n“I think he is outstanding and is going to make someone really happy in college football,” Poggi said. “He is getting better and better as the season goes on. He also gets better as the game goes on. He is that traditional big back that wears you down.” \nGilman feasted on two Spalding turnovers in the first quarter. \nGreyhounds’ safety Rob Levine picked off Spalding quarterback Evan Fochtman on the game’s third play.

(Karl Merton Ferron / Baltimore Sun) \nGilman needed only three plays to score as Dupree burst through the line for an 11-yard run only 41 seconds into play. \nSpalding (6-2) punted on its second possession, but its third was disastrous. \nLinebacker John Fitzgerald made a diving catch on a Fochtman pass and the Greyhounds cashed in eight plays later on Dupree’s 25-yard touchdown run to make it 13-0. \nFochtman had 18 touchdown passes and one interception coming into the game. \n“The turnovers crushed us,” Spalding coach Kyle Schmitt said. “And we allowed them to run the ball on us.” \nGilman scored on its four possessions in the second quarter to force a running clock in the second half. \nMaddox found the end zone on runs on 8 and 11 yards and quarterback Kasim Hill threw a touchdown pass to wide receiver Kory Stevens and also rushed for an 8-yard score. \nHill has a combined 20 touchdowns rushing and passing. \nMaddox and Hill are running behind a big and physical line of four seniors — tackles Devery Hamilton and Stephen Spanellis (6-5, 320, Virginia), center Stewart Keehner and guard Wes Mehl — who are committed to play in college. \nGilman finished with 411 yards of total offense and Alex Cohill kicked six extra points. \n“They are probably the best team I have ever coached against,” Schmitt said. “They are incredibly talented up front. If there is a better team on either side of the ball up front nationally better than them, then I really don’t want to see them.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:12:56.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
