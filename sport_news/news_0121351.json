But when she came in at first and started showing her raw talent, I knew that once she started working with the coaches, she was going to be one heck of a player.\"\nIt's not a shock, given that Thome was Ohio's Ms. Basketball after averaging 19.5 points, 9.5 rebounds and 4.6 blocks as a senior at Chagrin Falls High School.\nU-M coach Kim Barnes Arico, who recruited Thome and had seen her play, also is excited.\n\"I know we're only a week into practice, but I've left every day going, 'Oh my goodness, oh my goodness,'\" said Barnes Arico, who admitted she was hesitant to offer early praise on a freshman. \"I don't really ever say that about anyone. I think she has a chance to be really good. She's up and down, as she will be all season. But to be 6-5, have great hands, to run, be able to block shots to be able to catch the ball. We just throw the ball up now. It's funny. I've never really had somebody you could just throw the ball up to. My kids are starting to figure out just throw her the ball.\"\nThe most entertaining part for the Wolverines, looking to build on four straight 20-win seasons, is that the male college students who practice against the team are getting it stuffed back at them.\n\"She's doing it against the boys,\" Barnes Arico said. \"For a high school kid who has probably never had to go against boys every single day and she's finishing against them and blocking these guys' shots. … The boys are kind of embarrassed and not coming back anymore. So if she can have that impact for us during the season, it will be great.\"\nContact Mark Snyder: msnyder@freepress.com.
