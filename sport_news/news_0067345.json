However Boruc failed to hold it and spilt the ball straight into the path of Lamela, who made no mistake.Bournemouth were still creating chances of their own and were unlucky not to reduce the arrears just before the interval as Marc Pugh saw a scuffed effort cleared off the line by Alderweireld before King hit the inside of the post moments later.Boruc almost produced another moment to forget shortly after half-time as he took his time in clearing the ball and Dembele charged down his kick, although thankfully for the goalkeeper it rebounded straight back to him.He could do nothing to stop the fourth Spurs goal as Kane slid in to convert Eriksen's cross and put the result beyond doubt.With Kane in search of his second Premier League hat-trick, the England striker came close with a rasping shot that Boruc turned behind - but the wait would only go on for a few more seconds.The resulting corner was headed towards goal by Alderweireld and again Boruc could not hold on. Kane was on hand to score his third of the afternoon.Ritchie was the chief goal-threat for the shell-shocked hosts and forced Lloris into action with a long-range strike before Eriksen's fine effort came back off the post for Spurs.Kane had legitimate calls for a second penalty turned down by referee Roger East as he looked to capitalise on yet another Boruc spill, with the goalkeeper catching Kane's leg as he looked to recover.The striker was taken off with little over five minutes remaining, to be replaced by Clinton Njie. He failed to open his Tottenham account due to a smart stop by Boruc.
