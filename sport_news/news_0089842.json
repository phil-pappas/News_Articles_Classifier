(Photo: AP) \nSTARKVILLE, Miss. — Five miscues. Thirty-five points. And one long bus ride back to Ruston. \nSearching for its first road nonconference road win over a Power Five team under coach Skip Holtz, Louisiana Tech committed multiple errors that turned a competitive game into a blowout 45-20 win for Mississippi State on Saturday at Davis Wade Stadium. \nTech allowed two critical third down conversions, an interception that was returned for a touchdown, a blocked punt and a roughing the punter call that directly contributed to 35 points. \n\"Statistically, it’s pretty close football game, but when you have a punt blocked, you thrown an interception for a touchdown, you make some of the mistakes, special teams and offensive mistakes and then give up big-play touchdowns on defense, it makes for a lop side on the scoreboard,\" Tech coach Skip Holtz said. \nTech (4-3) jumped out to a 14-0 via two touchdown passes from quarterback Jeff Driskel. The lead was short-lived, though, as Mississippi State scored 24 of the next 27 points to take a 24-17 lead at halftime. \nIn total, Mississippi State (5-2) outscored Tech 45-6 over the final 49:27 of game action. \nDriskel, whose fourth-quarter interception sealed the win for Mississippi State, finished 25-of-41 for 303 yards and two touchdowns. \nThe fifth-year senior had to shoulder the load for the second straight week with Kenneth Dixon out with an ankle injury. Tech also played with wide receiver Carlos Henderson, who is dealing with an internal injury. \nJarred Craft received another start and totaled 96 yards — 56 receiving and 48 rushing. \nTrent Taylor continued to be a target monster, hauling in 10 catches for 130 yards and a score. His 16-yard score came at the 4:27 mark of the first quarter. Tech managed just two field goals from Jonathan Barnes the rest of the game. \nHaughton product Dak Prescott led Mississippi State with 347 yards and four total touchdowns — three passing and one running. Wide receiver De’Runnya Wilson killed Tech with seven catches for 85 yards and two scores. \nPrescott kept multiple drives alive with his legs and helped Mississippi State convert 6-of-13 third downs. By comparison, Tech managed just 3-of-14 on third downs. \n“We were 4-of-15? Yeah, that’s tough. It’s hard to win games when you’re only converting 4-of-15,\" Driskel said. \"They had a good plan on third down. It comes down to executing and we didn’t execute.\" 5 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/sports/college/la-tech/2015/10/17/miss-state-pulls-away-la-tech/74139178/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:44:16.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
