When is another matter. \nThe Rams, Raiders and Chargers all have designs on moving to L.A., which has not had an NFL franchise since 1995. \nThe current timetable calls for submission of applications to relocate in January, when the owners could vote. \nAlso at Wednesday’s meetings, NFL owners approved more international games through 2025, including ones in places other than England, possibly Mexico, Germany and Canada. \nLuck goes to Houston \nColts quarterback Andrew Luck made the trip to Houston for tonight’s game against the Texans, but it’s still not clear if he’ll play. Luck was limited in practice this week with an injured right shoulder, and the Colts re-signed quarterback Josh Johnson, who they originally signed Friday then released Monday. \nBills sign two \nThe Bills added kicker Billy Cundiff after Dan Carpenter missed two field goals and one PAT through four games. The Bills also signed receiver Denarius Moore. \nBriefs \nFire officials say a blaze that destroyed an East Texas home belonging to the grandfather of Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel appears to be suspicious. … Falcons receiver Roddy White skipped practice for an undisclosed personal matter, while the team addressed concerns that he’s not happy with a diminished role in the offense. … Titans rookie Dorial Green-Beckham says he thought police gave him only a warning ticket for speeding in July, and was surprised to learn of an outstanding warrant when he was stopped in Missouri last week. \n— Associated Press  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:49:25.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
