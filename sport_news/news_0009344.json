However the clerk at the store told her it was not a winning ticket and the woman left. Later she went back inside and requested that the clerk return her ticket. The clerk told her that it was against the law to return the ticket and said the ticket had been thrown away. At that time the woman called the police.\nWhen officers spoke to the clerk she said the ticket was not a winner and had been thrown in the dumpster. After quite some time of sorting through refuse in the dumpster the ticket was not found. The officers then when went inside to view store video of the incident. While they were doing so the clerk showed up with the ticket, saying she had found it.\nHowever a passerby reported that the clerk had retrieved the ticket from the trunk of her car not the dumpster.\nThe video showed the clerk scan the ticket, realize it was a winner, clear the notification, set the ticket aside and tell the complainant it was not a winning ticket. Then after the woman left the store the clerk put the ticket in the trash and left the store to empty the trash.\nThe clerk finally admitted she had hidden the ticket, planning to cash it herself and keep the winnings.\nThe complainant agreed to not file charges if the clerk paid her the winnings she would have received from the ticket (the ticket had been torn in half by the clerk and was thus unredeemable). The clerk paid the complainant $1,000.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/maxresdefault_0.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/maxresdefault_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:15:42.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
