Pakistan won the recently concluded T20 series against Zimbabwe with Afridi scoring just two runs in each match. \nHe bowled three overs for 23 runs in the first T20 and went wicket-less while in the second T20 Afridi bowled four overs giving away 26 runs without taking any wicket. \nSarfraz said a player like Afridi who just performs once in a blue moon cannot be trusted. \nIt is pertinent to mention that Afridi also performed poor in the National T20 Cup held at Rawalpindi in September and when Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Shahryar Khan was asked about it, he said Afridi is capable of enormous success and is a match winner who can turn around the game at any stage. He also assured to support the all-rounder for the T20 WC. \nSarfraz said it is the foolishness on part of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) as they have time and again given chance to Afridi after he has not performed. \n\"PCB should not go on ifs and buts hoping that Afridi would perform some day,\" he said adding what is the mistake of other deserving players who are far more better than him. \nTalking about the ICC keeping an eye of Pakistan off-spinners bowling actions, he said our umpires should check the doubtful actions in the domestic circuit. \nCommenting on Younis Khan, Sarfraz said Younis deserves a place in the ODI squad as a player like him can stand on the crease for 50 overs but our other players cannot.
