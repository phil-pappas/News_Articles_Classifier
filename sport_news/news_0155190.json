Though she's a good student, her mind isn't as much on her classes here at Roosevelt, as it is on a hospital in her native land of Ethiopia. \n\"I visited there and what I saw was so astonishing; because there were a lot of women affected by disease,\" Arega said. \nTsegab's family emigrated from Ethiopia more than 11 years ago, but much of her family is still there. \n\"My grandfather is a doctor and he worked with a lot of gynecologists and I want to focus on that in the future and so I went and it was very tragic what I saw,\" Arega said. \nWhat she saw were young women suffering horribly from a childbirth injury at Hamlin Fistula hospital in Ethiopia . The hospital was started by Catherine Hamlin, an Australian gynecologist Hamlin lead the effort to repair the problem that as many as two million women suffer from called obstetric fistula. It happens when the baby gets stuck in the birth canal and there is no doctor to perform a cesarean section. The babies die, and the women are left incontinent of urine or feces or both. And they are shunned by others. \n15-year-old Tsegab saw the suffering firsthand among girls her own age. \n\"It’s completely flabbergasted. They were having babies at this age. They were not going to school,\" Arega said. \nTsegab was determined to help in any way she could. So she told her dad she had a project in mind and called it \"Lotions for Life.\" Her goal was to collect as many toiletries for women treated at the Ethiopian hospital as she could. \n\"She tell me and I say go ahead. That's good. You're helping people--very good,\" Tsegab's father Asaminew Abisso said. \n“My dad really always encouraged me to do more. And he is really open about everything he saw in Ethiopia,\" Arega said. \nTsegab has spoken at churches about her mission and sent out emails to stores asking for help. Her dad drives her around to pick up the donations. So far, she collected more than 100 items and is working through the Ethiopian embassy to get them to the women in need. \n\"And they travel to the capital city to get a treatment and they don't really experience items like this,\" Arega said. \nWhen people hear about Tsegab's project they're often surprised. \nTsegab Arega: \"Like seriously? You're 15 years old, you have to just go and have a party or something like that you know.\" Angela Kennecke: \"But?\" Arega: \"But I decided to spend my summer doing this.\" \nTsegab doesn't plan to stop helping Ethiopian women there. She hopes to dedicate her life to that mission. \nAngela Kennecke: \"What do you want to do?\" Arega: \"Maybe just open a hospital or something like that.\" Kennecke: \"You want to open your own hospital? Are you going to go to medical school?\" Arega: \"Yes.\" \n\"I always ask her one question - what is your future plan? 'I'm going to be a gynecologist.' I say, 'You like this?' And she says, 'Yes, I like this, I'm helping women,'\" Abisso said. \nHer dad, who has raised his four children with strong biblical principles, which include putting others first, couldn't be more proud. \nAngela Kennecke: \"Do you think she'll reach her goals?\" Asaminew Abisso: \"Yeah I do. Yeah, exactly.\" \nTsegab says she hopes her efforts to help the young Ethiopian women suffering go well beyond supplying them with lotions and soaps. \n\"I just want them to understand that we are there for them. They're not alone in this. That's just the big message of this,” Arega said. \nTsegab plans to send the items she collects to Ethiopia in January. She also hopes to start a club at Roosevelt to continue to help the Hamlin Fistula Hospital. \nYou can donate to her cause here.
