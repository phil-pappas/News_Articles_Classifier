In honor of his departure, here are a dozen of Spurrier's most colorful quips, most of which were shots at his Southeastern Conference opponents. On Auburn: 1. (After a fire at the Auburn library destroyed 20 books) \"The real tragedy was that 15 hadn't been colored yet.\" On Florida State: 2. (When Jadeveon Clowney got a speeding ticket) \"I didn't know Jadeveon's car could go that fast. He doesn't have a pretty car like those FSU guys used to drive.\" 3. \"You know what FSU stands for, don't you? Free Shoes University.\" On Alabama: 4. \"In 12 years at Florida, I don't think we ever signed a kid from the state of Alabama … Of course, we found out later that the scholarships they were giving out at Alabama were worth a whole lot more than ours.\" On Tennessee: 5. \"Will be the 14th time I've coached in Neyland Stadium. … I've coached there more than some of their head coaches.\" 6. (When asked about Tennessee's failure to make the Sugar Bowl while he was at Florida) \"You can't spell Citrus without U-T.\" 7. (On former Tennessee star Peyton Manning) \"I know why Peyton came back for his senior year. He wanted to be a three-time star of the Citrus Bowl.\" On Georgia: 8. \"I don't know. I sort of always liked playing them that second game because you could always count on them having two or three key players suspended.\" 9. \"Why is it that during recruiting season they sign all the great players, but when it comes time to play the game, we have all the great players? I don't understand that. What happens to them?\" On Clemson coach Dabo Swinney: 10. Swinney said of Spurrier: \"He's from Pluto, and I'm from Mars.\" Spurrier shot back: \"Dabo probably thinks there's only, what, nine planets out there? I think I read where Pluto may not be considered one now.\" On getting old: 11. \"People ask me why are you still coaching? I forgot to get fired and I'm not going to cheat.\" 12. \"The Pope is 77 years old and he's in charge of a billion people. All I have to do is put 11 on the field.\" Spurrier, 70, won the 1966 Heisman Trophy at Florida and guided the Gators to the 1996 national title. He also guided the Gamecocks to three consecutive 11-win seasons from 2011 to 2013 and compiled a 228-89-2 mark in 25 seasons as a college coach. \"I'll just be the former Head Ball Coach now,\" he said.
