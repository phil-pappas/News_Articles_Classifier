The Mali winger was in the Albion training ground and a deal was there to be done but Pulis held back, preferring to bide his time in a bid to lure other more-preferred targets. \nSako promptly signed for Palace, where he enjoyed an explosive start, scoring two in his first two games, which included the Eagles’ 2-1 win at Chelsea. \nAlbion’s attempts to snare the likes of QPR’s Matt Phillips, meanwhile, ended in disappointment and at times this season the Baggies have lacked the creativity on the flanks he, or Sako, might have provided. \nPulis, of course, is not a man to dwell on what might have been and makes a second return to his former club looking for a response to Monday’s 3-2 defeat to Everton, the first time a team he has managed in the Premier League has ever thrown away a two-goal lead to lose. \nQuite what was said in the Albion dressing room after the collapse one can only imagine, but if skipper Darren Fletcher is to be believed, players have been left in no doubt a repeat performance is unacceptable. \n“We work very hard on our defence, we pride ourselves on clean sheets, and to lose three goals after being two-nil up is not like us,” said the Baggies skipper. “We’ve got to look at ourselves, everyone, the whole team, and take responsibility for that defeat. What do you think? Log in and leave your thoughts below \n“Things are always said when you lose games and that’s important, you’ve got to realise these things can’t happen and it’s not acceptable. \n“It shouldn’t happen and if you just let games like that pass by then people think it’s taken lightly and it’s not taken lightly. \n“So things are said, it stays in the dressing room, and we try to make each other better and realise this cannot happen at this level.” \nDefeat halted a run of three unbeaten games for Albion but disappointing and ultimately surprising as it was, a positive result tomorrow would quickly ease any pain. \nLauded as Palace have been, they have won only once at home in the league to this point when Sako, on debut, grabbed a late winner against Villa. \nAnd while their defeats have admittedly come against the likes of Arsenal and Manchester City, Albion arrive boasting the second best away record in the division behind West Ham and a defence which is yet to be breached on its travels.
