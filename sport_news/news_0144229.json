The team's only loss came to Greece in the semifinals of the 2006 FIBA World Championship. Krzyzewski, 68, led the team to the 2010 world championship and the 2014 World Cup as well. During his tenure, the NBA's best players have returned to the national team, as opposed to skipping out on international competitions. Â© 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
