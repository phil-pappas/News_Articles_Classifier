(Photo: Evan Siegle/Press-Gazette Media/@PGevansiegle) Buy Photo \nThe De Pere football team enters the final week of the season having clinched a share of the Fox River Classic Conference title. \nThe Redbirds (8-0) have a chance to win it outright at Bay Port (7-1) on Friday against a Pirates squad that’s attempting to become the first team to win at least a share of two straight FRCC titles since the conference started play in 2007. \nDe Pere’s offense has been the best in the 10-team league, led by the senior trio of quarterback Cole Runge, running back Nik Ohuafi and wide receiver Zack Rabas. \nBut perhaps it’s the five guys blocking for them — junior left tackle Kyle Mathews, junior left guard Ryan Berg, senior center Ethan Gerbig, senior right guard Luke Nystrom and junior right tackle Jared Gossen — that deserve just as much credit for De Pere’s success. \nThe line averages 275 pounds, and it appears all five can pass and run block equally as well. \nThe Redbirds have piled up a league-high 3,869 yards and 184 first downs in eight games. \nThey have rushed for 2,498 yards, which is 542 more than any other team. They also have thrown for 1,371 yards, which ranks third in the league. \nIt would be easy for the offensive line to feel unappreciated, doing all the dirty work while watching everyone else get the glory. \nBut they don’t seem to care, especially since they constantly are reminded by their teammates just how thankful they are to have them. \n“Our team is so quick to give credit to those guys,” De Pere coach Chad Michalkiewicz said. “We have said from Day One that with the style of football we want to play, we will only be as good as our offensive line. \n“So they realize that Nik is a really rare talent and unbelievable, and obviously Cole is a magician back there running the read option, but even those guys cannot do it without help. I think, or I hope, that they realize just how special of a season they are having.” \nMathews is in his first season with De Pere after spending his first two years at Fond du Lac, while Berg started every game for the Redbirds as a sophomore last season. \nGerbig was an honorable mention selection on the all-conference team in 2014, and Gossen already has broken the deadlift records at the school. He is described by Michalkiewicz as “country strong.” \nThen there is Nystrom, who was a first-team all-conference pick as a junior and likely will be a first-team pick as a senior. He is a team captain, and despite more plays being run to the left side this season than last, he still is the guy the offensive line is run through. \n“The line around me has made me look even better,” Nystrom said. “So did Nik Ohuafi. If you look, sometimes he covered up for my mistakes, which made me look good. But I feel like I worked hard in the offseason. Step it up for senior year and leave on a high note. \n“We don’t care if outside people know (about us). Just as long as Cole and Nik and all our offensive producers know we helped them get the job done, that’s good enough for us.” \nHere are four other things to watch in Week 9. \nWin and in \nSeveral area teams have clinched a playoff spot entering the final week, but others still need to do some work. Teams with a winning conference record automatically earn a spot in the postseason, while a team that finishes .500 is playoff eligible. \nFRCC: De Pere (8-0), Bay Port (7-1), Green Bay Notre Dame (6-2), Ashwaubenon (5-3) and Green Bay Southwest (5-3) are in, while Green Bay Preble (4-4) must beat Pulaski to qualify. \nBay: Seymour (5-2) is in. West De Pere (4-3) is playoff eligible but can clinch a spot with a win against Shawano. Green Bay East (3-4) must beat Seymour to be playoff eligible. \nPackerland: Southern Door (5-0) and Kewaunee (5-1) have clinched. Algoma (2-3) must beat the conference champion Eagles to be playoff eligible. \nNorth Eastern: Wrightstown (5-2) and Luxemburg-Casco (5-2) have clinched. \nMarinette-Oconto: Coleman (6-0), Peshtigo (4-2) and Gillett (4-2) have clinched. Crivitz (3-3) and Suring (3-3) play each other with a postseason berth on the line. \nStar power \nThere will be several Green Bay Packers players at the De Pere-Bay Port game to help raise money for the Breast Cancer Family Foundation of Northeast Wisconsin. \nThe list of Packers attending include defensive tackle Mike Pennel, defensive back Micah Hyde and linebackers Jayrone Elliot and Sam Barrington. \nThe game will feature several pink elements, including equipment worn by the prep players on the field. Fans can purchase pink rally towels for $5 and have the chance to win autographed Packers items through bucket raffles. \nBlazing a trail \nN.E.W. Lutheran will play at Madison Abundant Life on Saturday. The winner will advance to play in the top-seeded game at the WIAA Jamboree for eight-man football on Oct. 31. \nMadison Abundant Life won the Great 8 South Conference title, while the Blazers won the Great 8 North Conference title for the third straight season. \nStaying hot \nSouthwest quarterback Clayton Ladsten enters the final week with the most passing yards (2,280) in the state, while Ashwaubenon quarterback Will Ark is seventh (1,986). \nLadsten has thrown for 118 yards more than any other quarterback. The Trojans play at Notre Dame on Friday. \nWeek 9 schedule \nDe Pere at Bay Port, G.B. Southwest at G.B. Notre Dame, Pulaski at G.B. Preble, Sheboygan North at Ashwaubenon, West De Pere at Shawano, Seymour at G.B. East, G.B.
