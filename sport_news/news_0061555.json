This team has high expectations of itself and enjoys the big occasions.” \nMoody was called into the New Zealand side after Tony Woodcock was injured and put out of the tournament in their final pool game against Tonga. \nThis is the fewest changes the All Blacks have made to their starting line-up so far in the tournament and the smallest between successive World Cup matches since making no changes to the side who defeated Australia in the 2011 semi-finals and went on to beat France in the final. \nWinger Julian Savea, who crossed for three of the All Blacks’ nine tries against France, has scored eight tries to equal the single tournament record held by South Africa’s Bryan Habana, who he faces on Saturday and All Blacks great Jonah Lomu. \nThe All Blacks’ matchday 23 has an average age of 28 and 1318 caps in experience. \nAll Blacks: \nBen Smith, Nehe Milner-Skudder, Conrad Smith, Ma’a Nonu, Julian Savea, Dan Carter, Aaron Smith; Kieran Read, Richie McCaw (capt), Jerome Kaino, Sam Whitelock, Brodie Retallick, Owen Franks, Dane Coles, Joe Moody. \nRes: Keven Mealamu, Ben Franks, Charlie Faumuina, Victor Vito, Sam Cane, Tawera Kerr-Barlow, Beauden Barrett, Sonny Bill Williams.
