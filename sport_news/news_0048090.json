So I was handicapped. And she threw me in the middle of the road, like when a car passes, somebody can hit me and I can die.\" <!--iframe--> \nOn mobile?

One year ago, Hilton couldn't even speak English. \nYears later, Michelle Hilton and her husband, a Methodist pastor in Chippewa, saw his smiling face in a photograph. They decided to adopt. \n\"I thought this kid just needs a chance, you know,\" Michelle Hilton said. \"What could happen if we just step out in faith and just give him a chance? And so we did, and it's good. It's not that hard.\" \nNow, Hilton is on the soccer field. \n\"He inspires so many guys,\" said Coach Bryan Vitali. \"He inspires me to come out and do my job better. The guys see him moving and they pick up their intensity. He's completely exceeded our expectations.\" \nThe goalie is allowed to kick with his arm, but CBS Pittsburgh reports that's the only break he gets. Although he is loved by his teammates, nobody coddles him on the practice field. \nThe newly adopted American admits to a bit of fear when he came out for the soccer team, but that quickly changed. \n\"They like me. They're happy, so I feel comfortable to be on the team,\" he said. \nhttp://www.cbsnews.com/news/high-school-soccer-goalie-excels-on-team-despite-having-no-legs/ Courtesy our partners at CBSNews.com Read or Share this story: http://on.wtsp.com/1Llvycf TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:16:08.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
