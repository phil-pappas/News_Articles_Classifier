Bush grew up in Houston, Texas and graduated from the University of Texas. Some highlights:\nShould Texas play Texas A&M?\n\"Absolutely. These great rivalries, I just think, irrespective of shifting around in conferences, there ought to be a way to have that accommodation. Football's a big business now, and you want to make sure you get the directional signage schools a chance to play so that they can get their money for the slaughter that goes on, but Texas-Texas A&M is just at the heart of Texas. Since Texas A&M has moved to the SEC, they've gotten really good, and Texas - unfortunately I'm an alum - they're not doing so hot right now. Maybe because of that, Texas is a little anxious to play. I think A&M would be chomping at the bit to play them right now.\"\nDo you think Charlie Strong is the answer at Texas?\n\"Boy, he is so well regarded. I don't quite get why it's not clicking right now. Part of it is the fact that the rest of the country is recruiting from Texas. Florida's had the exact same experience. For many years, Miami and Florida and Florida State had the cream of the crop of the best football state in the country. Texas is almost as good as Florida. I think the SEC draw has really had an impact on Texas' quality.\"\nDo you wish Texas was in the SEC?\n\"I do. I think they got greedy. The football deal, the football network thing that they thought they could go at it alone. It just didn't work.\"\n\"I do, I think Texas Football got greedy\" -- @JebBush tells @ClayTravisBGID that Texas should be in the SEC. https://t.co/GLEVEYDFhj\nâ€” FOX Sports Live (@FOXSportsLive) October 10, 2015 On Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/FOXSportsLive/status/652635750878449664", "https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW", "https://twitter.com/JebBush", "https://t.co/GLEVEYDFhj", "https://twitter.com/ClayTravisBGID"], "published": "2015-10-10T04:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:36:34.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
