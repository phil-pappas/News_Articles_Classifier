ANDY BURRISS aburriss@heraldonline.com i ROCK HILL \nDo you know where to go to get to Target? \nThat may have changed since the last time you took a trip down Interstate 77. This week, construction crews with the Department of Transportation finished work on a new interchange on Dave Lyle Boulevard, directing southbound traffic off of Interstate 77 and onto Chamberside Drive, the road that leads to the Target superstore, a Best Buy, and several restaurants and other offices. \nTraffic is supposed to come off the interstate to the stop light at Dave Lyle and the Exit 79 off-ramp, then turn into one of two left turn lanes on the far side of a new concrete median poured over the summer . Drivers heading west on Dave Lyle or turning right onto Tinsley Way have to merge onto the right-hand lane. \nBut even with the new lanes now open, crews still need to put in signs and permanent road stripping to tell drivers where to go. Currently, the only direction for drivers is an overhead sign on the off-ramp directing vehicles to the left or righ to reach Chamberside or Tinsley – road names many drivers may be less familiar with than the shopping outlets to which they connect. \nJohn Huskins, the resident DOT construction engineer for York County, said the project that began in May is now “probably 95 percent” complete, but it will stay take workers another two weeks to get all the new features added, weather permitting. \nSince a driver who merges right off the interstate won’t be able to cross over the new median, “you’re going to need to turn around,” Huskins said. Unsure how to make a left turn out of the Dave Lyle I-77 off-ramp? Here's a quick how-to video \nCrews still need to put up more signs around the intersection, including a “logo sign” on the off-ramp for the surrounding businesses as well as yield signs, plus therma-plastic permanent paint on the roadway. Workers will also be completing curbs and sidewalks around Tinsley Way and laying down new grass in the intersection. \n“After that, hopefully the barrels will be gone and we’ll be gone too,” Huskins said. \nThe $1.5 million project began in May, with crews working night shifts to improve traffic flow. Before that, anyone hoping to turn left off of the interstate had to quickly merge across three lanes of traffic. \nAnyone who overshoots the new left-turn lanes shouldn’t panic, Huskins said. Instead, drivers can continue through the light and turn onto Springsteen Road, which takes you into the same shopping center.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:28:53.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
