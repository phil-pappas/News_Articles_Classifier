Video by Mark Snyder/DFP Michigan State's Jalen Watts-Jackson (No. 20) recovers the muffed punt by Michigan punter Blake O'Neill (No. 12) and runs it back as the clock runs out for State's game winning touchdown and a 27-23 win on Saturday, October 17, 2015, in Ann Arbor.

Gonzalez, DFP) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nIt was the other end zone but the same feeling. \nTwenty-one years after Colorado's \"Miracle at Michigan\" — one of the most heartbreaking losses in college football history — U-M football fans learned it can be worse at Michigan Stadium. \nWith a program-defining win in their hands with 10 seconds remaining Saturday night, the Wolverines literally threw the game away, into the hands of arch-rival Michigan State, losing, 27-23. \nU-M punter Blake O'Neill only needed to catch and boot the ball deep, and most, if not all of the clock, would have expired, sealing the Wolverines' 23-21 advantage. No. 12 Michigan would have sealed a rare win over the No. 7 Spartans, just the second in eight years, and would have been dancing up the tunnel, dreaming of roses or even playoff possibilities. \nInstead, O'Neill bobbled the ball. Instead of falling on it, he tried to kick it, but the ball never made it to his foot. It swung right into the arms Michigan State's Jalen Watts-Jackson, who barreled into the end zone for the game-winning score with no time left. Incredible. Absolutely incredible!
