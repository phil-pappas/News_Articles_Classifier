I don’t know. Can it be going on? Yes. But I can’t say it’s going on, I can’t say it’s not going on because it’s not a fact,” he said Thursday night.\nUrsini said no one at the league is involved; its focus is on developing youth players in Canada and it brings any allegations of match-fixing, like one receiving on Tuesday, to authorities.\nThe ICSS confirmed the existence of the report in a statement, saying it was written for law enforcement and sports investigators. “Whilst it is regrettable that this intelligence report has been made public, this apparent conspiracy has grave ramifications for (organized) sport and sport betting well beyond the mere cumulative size of the frauds,” the statement read.\nICSS said the alleged corruption of the league — including allegations of wholesale match-fixing, betting fraud and “quite possibly” money laundering — has likely “been led by organized crime groups based in Europe involving a complex network of individuals within the league and most likely Asian-based illegal sport betting operators.”\nThe report was submitted to national and international authorities, including the RCMP and Canadian authorities, Interpol, Europol and FIFA.\nThe private semi-professional league was previously named in one of Europe’s largest match fixing investigations out of Bochum, Germany, when fixer Ante Sapina admitted to rigging a 2009 match. Ursini said those allegations were dismissed about eight months ago.\nThe CSL was expelled from membership of the Canadian Soccer Association in early 2014 for failing to fulfill its member obligations and violated the association’s rules and regulations, according to a statement released by Canada Soccer at the time.\nUrsini said the league did not violate the rules but he is barred from commenting about it due to arbitration on the case.\nHe said he thinks its good thing, as per the Telegraph ’s report, that some bookmakers are not longer offering markets on the competition.\n“We’d prefer if we could just shut out all gambling on the league and then there would be no issues.”\nMore on thestar.com\nHow the Kansas City Royals won the American League\nToronto Blue Jays’ playlist features Drake, Phil Collins and Kendrick Lamar", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:18:14.401+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
