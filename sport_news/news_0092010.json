With Brandon Weeden in for the injured Tony Romo, Williams was targeted twice--once on the second play of the game, and again in the fourth quarter. He dropped both of those passes, though he was facemasked on the first of the two so it actually went for a positive gain. Cowboys Can't go 'Oh-Fer' in Romo's Absence: S. Jones “ It’s my job to be ready no matter if it’s toward the end of the game, the beginning of the game or the last pass ,” Williams said, per Jean-Jacques Taylor of ESPN Dallas. \"I have to be ready. There are no excuses for dropping passes or stuff like that. I have to cash in on my chances because you have guys depending on me. Whether it’s the last quarter, the last minute or the last second you have to fight throughout the whole game.” Interestingly enough, Williams’ only touchdown and over a quarter of his yardage in 2015 to this point came from a single pass from Weeden, a 42-yard catch-and-run after he took over for Romo in the win over the Eagles in Week 2. Brees Feels 'Really Good' About Playing Vs. Cowboys “Our job as receivers is to make it quarterback friendly like we do for Tony,” Williams said. “We did a great job today in practice just working our hands because they have big, physical corners and if you don’t get their hands off you, you're going to look bad.” Published at 12:37 PM CDT on Oct 1, 2015 Copyright NBC Owned Television Stations", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:53:48.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
