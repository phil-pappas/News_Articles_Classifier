And perhaps no players are under closer examination than the point guards.\nJarrett Jack and Shane Larkin know it, too.\n\"Obviously, me and Jack, we both feel like we have something to prove,\" Larkin said Friday at the team's practice facility.\n\"Everybody says [Jack's] a backup point guard, now he's in the starter's role,\" Larkin said. \"Everybody said I can't play — or whatever they said. And obviously I want to go out there and show people I can play.\"\nAs disappointing as Deron Williams' tenure in Brooklyn was, he was still a reliable and efficient starting point guard.\nThat's something Jack and Larkin have yet to show.\nJack, who missed Friday's practice with a sore left hamstring, has carved out a career as a sound backup. He has started more than 55 games in a season only once: in 2006-07. \nAs a 23-year-old he started all 79 games he played in for the Portland Trailblazers. Jack, who turns 32 on opening night Wednesday, is expected to be the Nets starter.\nLarkin, in his third season, has yet to find sustainable success in the NBA. He was injured as a rookie in Dallas. \nLast season, he never seemed at home in the Knicks' triangle offense. Team president Phil Jackson even criticized Larkin in an ESPN.com article looking back on the season, saying \"he can't control the ball because he has such tiny hands\" and that there are \"a lot of guys\" with his talents.\nLarkin said he is not bothered by the criticism of Jack and himself. But he also admitted that he's much more comfortable in the Nets' system, which works off of screen-and-rolls.\n\"Obviously, the triangle's great,\" Larkin said. \"Won many championships, Phil Jackson's a great coach, great guy, Zen Master. D-Fish [Knicks coach Derek Fisher] has won championships in it. So they obviously know what they're doing over there.\n\"They had a pretty good preseason, so obviously they found players who fit their system better than last year,\" Larkin said. \"I wish them nothing but the best. Congrats on a great preseason, but I feel like this is definitely a better fit for me.\"\nEmail: vasqueza@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:02:33.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
