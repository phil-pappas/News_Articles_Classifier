They also use safety Colin Jones as a bigger option to press on the line and in running situations. Matthews expects to see both. \n\"It's definitely been interesting watching film on them to get something on both of them going into this game,\" Matthews said. \nThe matchup in the slot might be more appealing than the outside, where the unbeaten Panthers are receiving strong play from their cornerbacks. Josh Norman has been one of the NFL's best at his position this season and has four interceptions in five games. Charles Tillman, a two-time Pro Bowler, plays on the other side. Together, they've allowed 64 yards per game and only one touchdown this season. \nMatthews might venture beyond the slot on Sunday. Agholor did not play Monday against the New York Giants. When Cooper and Josh Huff were hurt during the game, the Eagles played more two-tight end sets and moved Matthews to the outside. \nThat could be an option if Cooper and Agholor are out. Even if Cooper plays, the Eagles could use Matthews more on the outside if they want to get both tight ends on the field or Darren Sproles in the slot. Huff, Miles Austin, and Seyi Ajirotutu are the other receivers on the roster. \n\"We can use him, and the thing with that is we had a couple guys in the game get banged up, so if we are going to be in [two-tight end alignment], we have to get our two best receivers on the field,\" Kelly said. \"Jordan was one of them because Huff was banged up for a little bit, then came back. Coop was banged up but then came back. So we were thin a little bit for a little while there at receiver, but Jordan can play any position for us - outside receiver, right side, left side or inside.\" \nWhen Matthews was at Vanderbilt, he spent most his time as an outside receiver and \"did slot in special situations,\" he said. He has spent time in practice on the outside and is also studying the position in the playbook. Matthews said when the signals come during the game, he sometimes needs to tell the outside receiver behind him the call. \n\"It's one thing to know what everyone's doing,\" Matthews said. \"It's another thing to be able to know it and be able to do it.\" \nHowever he is used, the Eagles need Matthews to look closer to the player from the last Carolina game than how he has looked in recent weeks. Matthews' two best games this season came in the first two weeks. His production has slipped since then and drops have been an issue throughout the season. \n\"I think the game has ebbs and flows and sometimes you have weeks where your number is going to get called a lot based upon how people cover you and sometimes you're not,\" Kelly said, \"but Jordan handles it great.\" \nIn the first few weeks of the season, the Eagles' passing game was built around the inside targets - Matthews and Zach Ertz - more than the outside receivers. That has changed in recent weeks, with Austin, Cooper, and Huff playing bigger roles. \nThat's dictated by the coverages the Eagles are seeing. They're seeing more man-to-man defense than zone defense this year. In those situations, the Eagles go where the best matchup is. Against zone defenses, they can find soft pockets and go underneath. \nWhether it's man-to-man or zone defense, the Eagles think Matthews can win his matchup. He did it against Carolina last year, but he has not done it enough in recent weeks. \n\"I always look at it [as] I've got to go out there and play better,\" Matthews said. \"There's nothing that they can do on their defense that if . . . I do my job, they can stop [me]. That's honestly my mind-set.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:26:30.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
