With power like that you can bet the suspension, axles and transfer case will need to be beefy. We were able to peek under the truck and see the axles in person, boy are they huge! The front axle has locking hubs and the transfer case is bigger than the current generation too. \nWe can’t wait to see what the official specs are on this beast of a truck and what GM and Ram will do compete. Until Ford releases the numbers enjoy our behind the scenes photos and see if you can tell what axles and transfer case are in the 2017 Ford Super Duty!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:14:43.745+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
