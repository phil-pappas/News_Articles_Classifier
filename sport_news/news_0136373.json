(AP) — Rider University in New Jersey suspended its entire men’s cross-country team after saying the team’s plan to run naked around the school’s track was hazing. \nSchool police responded to a report of students at the track on the evening of Sept. 5 and found team members preparing to run naked. The school launched an investigation of all 28 members of the men’s team. \nUniversity spokeswoman Kristine Brown tells NJ.com (http://bit.ly/1Ldsttn ) the investigation found no intent to coerce any of the team members to participate. But Brown says the behavior was unacceptable and considered hazing. \nThe team’s coach canceled practice and the team was suspended from competing in a Rider-hosted meet on Sept. 19. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:03:23.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
