The next two games, if necessary, would then be played in Missouri.\nThe World Series is scheduled to begin Oct. 27 in the American League champion's ballpark.\nAt first glance, there would appear to be time to reconfigure the stadium to accommodate the Toronto-Montreal football game Friday night. But Argos president/CEO Chris Rudge said Rogers Centre officials don't believe the reconfiguration is possible.\n\"We have been informed by Rogers Centre officials that there is insufficient time to convert the stadium from baseball to football, and then back again, to accommodate our game on the 23rd,\" Rudge said in a statement. \"The game is to be played in just seven days and the most logical course of action for our team and for our fans is to move on and prepare to play the game at a stadium that is available, meets CFL standards and is broadcast-ready.\"\nThe Argos host the Calgary Stampeders at Tim Hortons Field on Saturday because of a potential scheduling conflict at Rogers Centre created by the baseball playoffs.\nRudge said Toronto's scheduled home game against the B.C. Lions on Oct. 30 at Rogers Centre remains in question. Should a conflict arise, Rudge added that contest would likely also be played at Tim Hortons Field.\n\"We will continue to work on alternate plans for our Oct. 30 home game against the BC Lions should there be another similar conflict with the MLB post-season schedule,\" he said. \"Those plans are not yet final but will most likely result in our team playing at Tim Hortons Field.\n\"We will communicate the appropriate details as early as possible once a decision is known. Again, we thank everyone for their continued support and patience during this unusual time.\"\nToronto has already been forced to relocate two home games -- the season-opening 26-11 win over Edmonton at Fort McMurray, Alt., and a 38-35 victory in Ottawa on Oct. 6 -- due to the Pan Am Games and scheduling issues at Rogers Centre.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:05:04.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
