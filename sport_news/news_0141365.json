Albert Cesare / Advertiser (Photo: .) \nAUBURN – Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn says he won’t allow the dismissal of D’haquille Williams to cause a change in his conduct policy in regards to players frequenting bars near campus. \nMalzahn said Wednesday during the Southeastern Conference media teleconference said that he does allow players to visit bars after games on a Saturday and will not allow reports of Williams’ incident this past weekend to affect such a policy. \n\"We'll continue to do what we've been doing,\" Malzahn said Wednesday on the teleconference. \"We had one young man that didn't represent us in the right way. We've got a bunch of guys that do it the right way.\" \nMultiple reports have surfaced, with Auburnsports.com being the first to break the story Monday evening, that an incident over the weekend involving Williams took place at Skybar, a downtown bar off Magnolia Street in Auburn. \nAuburn dismissed Williams from the football program permanently Monday evening and Malzahn refused the next day to discuss any of the details that led to the decision. \n“I gave him a chance to prove himself and I'm disappointed it didn't work out,” Malzahn said Tuesday. “I'm not going to get into details regarding that. That's been us and he's dismissed from the team.” \nMalzahn said Tuesday that Williams had “not much” of a reaction when he was informed Monday evening of the decision. Auburn players were informed of the news by the school release sent out but Auburn senior captain Jonathan Wallace said players have reached out to Williams since the dismissal. \n“Personally, I love him to death,” Wallace said. “I'm sad to see this had to take place but it needed to be done so we can move forward and get better as a team.” \nMalzahn wouldn’t comment Tuesday if any other players were involved in the incident that led to Williams’ dismissal but did confirm the senior wide receiver is no longer enrolled at the school. \n“It’s kind of unfortunate it happened, but you got to draw the line somewhere,” Wallace said. “We move forward, everybody is handling it the right way.” \nMalzahn did say Wednesday during the teleconference that, like any other head coach, has uncomfortable feelings with his players being out late at bars but will not implement a curfew or bed check for his players in the future. Auburn players are taken to a hotel in Montgomery to stay the night before home games during the season. \n\"Really, there's been times I've told them we're not going to do that but at the same time you want your players to be responsible adults,\" Malzahn said Wednesday.
