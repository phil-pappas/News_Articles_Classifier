Here are some highlights.\nQuestion: Do you foresee Dallas' next three opponents, Seattle in particular, having trouble blocking the Cowboys rushmen?\nBob Sturm: I think the Giants and the Seahawks have poor OL situations. Heck, the Eagles are not good either. So, in the next 3 weeks, the Cowboys DL should have a decided advantage over the opponent OL. We will have to see if they can make that matter.\nQuestion: What would be considered a good performance from Matt Cassel?\nBob Sturm: 240 yards, 2 TDs. That might be asking for a bit, but I bet that is what they need to win.\nQuestion: Does Cassel give the Cowboys a chance to do or try anything that Weeden may have not?\nBob Sturm: Yes. He has a chance to throw passes into the seams and deep middle. Weeden only threw a few passes past 10 yards and they were invariably deep go routes to the sideline. The Cowboys stopped using the field between the numbers and 10+ downfield. They must start to challenge that with some regularity to loosen up things underneath and for the running game. They must.\nQuestion: What did the Patriots do in the second half of the Dallas game that allowed them so much success? Put another way, what did Dallas do differently?\nBob Sturm: Well, the Cowboys offense did the Patriots some big favors as the game developed for sure. The lack of any sort of sustained attack on the ground or through the air was a problem. But Brady really went to work against the man coverage of Dallas after the half and attacked with rub routes and pick plays that made the throws easy and the gains big. I think the Cowboys should have switched into some more matchup zones, but they were stubborn. The Patriots took that stubbornness and attacked it with stubbornness of their own.\nQuestion: Any chance that when O'Leary get healthy that he moves to RG with Martin moving to RT to replace Free?\nBob Sturm: Ron Leary? Or is there a new Irish linemen here? I think there will be another injury on the OL at which time Ron Leary will get another look. Health can change in the blink of an eye in the NFL. Free is hanging in there and will likely be replaced next spring, but for now, I hear nothing about wanting to replace him by the team.\nQuestion: How come the Cowboys have completely gotten away from running out of the shotgun? That seemed to be effective for them in the past bit now if they are in the gun, you can pretty much guarantee they are going to pass.\nBob Sturm: Yes, that is true. I suspect the sooner they can complete passes outside or deep, they will loosen up the middle again and then unleash some more runs from passing looks. For now, they can't really do anything offensively so they have been chased out of these simple tactics that throw off tendencies. They are really a mess with the ball right now.\nQuestion: Will Weeden be in the NFL next year?\nBob Sturm: Sure. There are 96 jobs. He is poor, but there are many poor QBs with jobs.\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE FULL CHAT\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsSturm", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SportsSturm"], "published": "2015-10-23T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:54:53.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
