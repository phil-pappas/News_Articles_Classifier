(AP Photo/Charles Krupa) By Associated Press \nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. — Tom Brady overcame New England’s shaky first three quarters by throwing a pair of touchdowns in the fourth, and the Patriots beat the New York Jets 30-23 on Sunday to remain unbeaten. New England has a two-game lead over New York in the AFC East. \nBrady completed 14 of 17 passes in the final quarter and was 34 of 54 for 355 yards overall — numbers that would have been even better if not for the 11 drops by his receivers, six by newly activated Brandon LaFell. \nThe Jets kicked a field goal on first down and then recovered the onside kick with 15 seconds left. But a false-start penalty on Brandon Marshall ended the game after a short pass from Ryan Fitzpatrick left the Jets 37 yards from the tying score. \nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Dwayne Harris sped 100 yards with a kickoff return against his former Dallas teammates seconds after the Cowboys had tied the game, and New York moved atop the NFC East with a victory. \nHarris spent four seasons in Dallas without running back a kickoff for a score. But he tied a Giants record set in 1994 by romping untouched to the end zone. \nNew York (4-3) snapped a five-game slide against Dallas (2-4) thanks to big plays by its defense and special teams. Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie had two interceptions, returning one 58 yards for a touchdown. \nMIAMI GARDENS — Miami became the first team since at least 1940 to score four offensive touchdowns of at least 50 yards in a half. \nThe Dolphins led 41-0 at halftime, making the drubbing even more emphatic than a 38-10 win at Tennessee a week earlier in Dan Campbell’s debut as head coach. \nNow he’s the fifth interim coach of 26 since 2000 to win his first two games. Since the firing of Joe Philbin on Oct. 5, the Dolphins (3-3) have gone from notorious underachievers to contending for their first playoff berth since 2008. \nLANDOVER, Md. — Kirk Cousins threw three second-half touchdown passes, including the go-ahead score with 24 seconds left, to lead Washington to the largest comeback in franchise history. \nTampa Bay (2-4) was up 24-0 in the second quarter, before Cousins ran for an 8-yard TD to get Washington (3-4) on the board. \nCousins hadn’t completed more than one TD pass in any game all season. But he got a pair of 3-yard scores in the third quarter, sandwiched around an onside kick, to make things interesting. \nThen, trailing 30-24, Washington got the ball at its 20 with a little less than 2½ minutes left in the fourth quarter. Cousins capped the drive with a 6-yard TD toss to Jordan Reed. \nSAN DIEGO — Derek Carr threw three touchdown passes, including a 52-yarder to Amari Cooper, and Oakland turned two interceptions of Philip Rivers into 10 points on their way to an easy victory in what could be the last game of the AFC West rivalry played in San Diego. \nIt was the first meeting of the Raiders (3-3) and Chargers (2-5) since their owners announced plans to build a $1.7 billion stadium in an industrial Los Angeles suburb if they can’t get new stadiums in their home markets. \nComing off a bye, the Raiders looked quicker and more efficient. Cooper, the first-round draft pick out of Alabama, caught a short pass from Carr on an inside screen and raced through the defense to give Oakland a 30-3 lead. \nDETROIT — Teddy Bridgewater threw for a season-high 316 yards and two touchdowns for Minnesota. \nAdrian Peterson rushed for 98 yards as the Vikings (4-2) won an NFC North game on the road for the first time in three years. \nThe Lions (1-6) had an 11-point lead after Matthew Stafford threw TDs on their first two drives, but they blew it because they couldn’t protect the quarterback. \nNASHVILLE, Tenn. — Matt Ryan threw for 251 yards and a touchdown pass, and Devonta Freeman ran for 116 yards. \nThe Falcons (6-1) bounced back from their first loss by grinding out a road win and overcoming two interceptions. Freeman notched his third consecutive game with at least 100 yards, and Atlanta outgained Tennessee 378-256. \nThe banged-up Titans (1-5) lost their fifth straight overall. They played without rookie quarterback Marcus Mariota, who was replaced by Zach Mettenberger. \nST. LOUIS — Rookie Todd Gurley rushed for 128 yards and his first two touchdowns, helping St. Louis to the win. \nSt. Louis (3-3) had four sacks and recovered four fumbles. The Rams scored 10 points off miscues on Cleveland’s first two series, a 17-yard fumble recovery by Rodney McLeod and a field goal after the first of William Hayes’ two sacks and strips of Josh McCown on the day. \nJohnny Manziel got mop-up duty for the Browns (2-5) after McCown left favoring his right arm with about four minutes left. \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — Alex Smith threw for 251 yards and a touchdown, Cairo Santos kicked three field goals as Kansas City ended a five-game losing streak. \nCharcandrick West added 110 yards rushing and his first career touchdown for the Chiefs (2-5), and Eric Berry intercepted his first pass since his cancer diagnosis last December. \nMeanwhile, the Chiefs shut down Pittsburgh’s Landry Jones, who made his first NFL start in place of the injured Ben Roethlisberger and Mike Vick. Jones threw for 209 yards and a touchdown, but he was also picked off twice and lost a fumble. \nLeVeon Bell ran for 121 yards for the Steelers (4-3). \nINDIANAPOLIS — Drew Brees threw for 255 yards and one touchdown, Khiry Robinson ran for two scores and New Orleans held on for the victory. \nNew Orleans (3-4) has won three of its past four. Indy (3-4) still leads the AFC South despite losing its second straight. \nBrees finished 28 of 44 and was helped by a running game led by Mark Ingram, who ran for 143 yards and one score as New Orleans took a 27-0 lead. \nAndrew Luck threw TD passes of 87 and 46 yards to T.Y. Hilton, and an 8-yard TD pass to Donte Moncrief with 3:46 left to make it 27-21.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:49:38.433+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
