(Scott Halleran / Getty Images) \nWith separate displays of quickness and power, Southland boxing prospects Joseph Diaz and Frankie Gomez cruised to convincing victories Friday night. \nAt Fantasy Springs Resort Casino in Indio, Diaz and Gomez each won every round of their bouts. \nThe southpaw Diaz (18-0) smoothly outboxed taller veteran Ruben Tamayo (25-7-4), sharply avoiding damage while routinely whipping his featherweight foe with combinations punctuated by the left hand. \n\"I wanted to prove I was on another level from this guy and win decisively,\" Diaz said. \"We landed counters and effective shots. I kept my distance, threw my shots and got right back out. \n\"I proved I'm tough and durable and showed I can adapt to a taller guy to any style.\" \nSouth El Monte's Diaz is scheduled to fight again Nov. 20 at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas, and said he plans to work toward a title shot in 2016 after moving up from super-bantamweight for Friday's bout.

Gomez, 23, fought as if he were unleashing the hostility over his layoff, which included a settled petty theft case and his missed weight on a May 9 HBO card headlined by Saul \"Canelo\" Alvarez. \n\"I felt great, threw my right so good until about the seventh round, when I hurt it with an overhand right,\" Gomez said. \"I kind of knew I wasn't going to be able to knock him out, but I landed a lot of punches.\" \nHe immediately backed up Silva with a right in the first round, delivered an impressive combination in the second and started treating Silva like a punching bag in the third. \nGomez's willingness to engage earned him his first career cut (by a head butt) over the left eye in the ninth round. \nHis quickness and power shined, showing why he's one of Los Angeles' top boxing prospects, especially with improved commitment. \nGomez blew a chance at a significant bout earlier this year when he was overweight, forcing the cancellation of his co-main event against former world champion Humberto Soto in Houston. \nFriday's bout was scheduled to be fought at a welterweight catchweight limit of 146 pounds, but Gomez again missed weight, coming in at 150 pounds. \nFortunately for him, Silva was overweight too, and the bout proceeded. \n\"He'll be back in the gym Monday, and I promise you we'll not only get him back down to 140, but that he'll do some major damage once he's there. I love this kid,\" said Gomez's trainer, Freddie Roach. \nGomez said he believes he's capable of reaching 140 after one more bout. \n\"I got in 10 good rounds,\" he said. \"I needed this.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:11:55.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
