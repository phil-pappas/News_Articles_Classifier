(Nick Wass and Don Wright/Associated Press) Alexander Pyles Contact Reporter The Baltimore Sun Ravens WR Steve Smith Sr. and Cardinals WR Larry Fitzgerald are neck-and-neck on the all-time receptions list. \nThey won't meet on the field tonight, but Ravens wide receiver Steve Smith Sr. and Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald are competing nonetheless. \nFitzgerald, 32, has 952 career receptions. Smith, 36 and perhaps in his last NFL season, has 951. \nAssuming Smith decides to retire after this season -- he announced that intention before the season began and has told reporters that plan remains \"on schedule\" -- the younger Fitzgerald will almost certainly finish his career with more catches than Smith. \nThat doesn't mean the Ravens' best receiver can't finish this season on top of Fitzgerald. The pair are among four NFL pass-catchers (San Francisco's Anquan Boldin and Dallas' Jason Witten are the others) within striking distance of 1,000 career catches this season. \nJust 10 receivers have that many; Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Hines Ward (1,000 catches) was the last player to join the club, in 2011. \nSmith and Fitzgerald are having outstanding seasons. Smith, despite missing one game, leads the Ravens in receiving with 36 catches, 510 yards and three touchdowns. Fitzgerald last had 1,000 receiving yards in a season in 2011, but is well on his way this year: he's caught 43 passes for 583 yards and six touchdowns.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T22:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:49:48.464+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
