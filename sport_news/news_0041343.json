(AP) - State officials say they're trying to measure whether struggling school districts are getting good results from contractors hired to help teachers and students.\nIn a presentation Thursday to the State Board of Education, Jamilliah Longino said that the state's Office of School Improvement has begun meeting quarterly with contractors to 26 school districts.\nThose low-performing districts are targeted for extra help by the office, which Longino directs.\nThe idea is to measure what goals contractors are setting and whether they and district leaders are achieving those goals\nState Superintendent Carey Wright says many smaller districts depend on vendors to help teachers improve instruction because they don't have enough internal capacity. She says the idea is to present information to local superintendents about which vendors are achieving results in school districts.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
