Comment   By Staff reports Posted Oct. 10, 2015 at 7:30 AM By Staff reports Posted Oct. 10, 2015 at 7:30 AM YORK — Four Waynesboro golfers began play on Friday in the two-day District 3-AAA boys’ and girls’ tournament. Three remain in contention for a regional berth as Nick Franki, Olivia Gardenhour and Erika Cauffman made the cut at Briarwood Golf Course. Franki finished tied with two others for ninth on the 6,608-yard, par-72 Briarwood East course. Gardenhour finished in a two-way tie for seventh at the 5,433-yard, par-70 Briarwood East course. Cauffman was the last to make the cut, finishing 15th. Taylor Zimmerman also competed but did not make it to day two. “I am very proud of Nick. He could have easily bagged it early,” said Waynesboro coach Ryan Henderson. “He was six over through 13 holes. But his age and his experience helped him to persevere. He finished incredibly strong. He went birdie, birdie, par, eagle, par to finish. He was four under through those five holes.” Franki shot 37 on the front and back nines to finish with a 74 on the day. He’s four shots off the pace set by Central York’s Gus Minkin. “Olivia had a nice round for her second appearance at districts (80),” Henderson said. “She is sitting in seventh place right now and has a great chance of advancing to regionals. She has been our top female this season and has handled the pressure very well.” Gardenhour is shots shots behind leader Morgan Frazier of Cumberland Valley. Gardenhour finished with a 41 on the front nine and 39 on the back nine. Cauffman and Big Spring’s Isabelle Macioce both finished with 90s to advance to today’s second round. “Erika was right on the cutline with her score of 90,” Henderson said. “We talked about some things that need to change for (Saturday’s) round. She is capable of shooting a much lower score. She still has a chance to advance to regionals. “Taylor had a rough start and things did not improve during her round. She gained some valuable experience for next season.” By Staff reports   By Staff reports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:15:36.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
