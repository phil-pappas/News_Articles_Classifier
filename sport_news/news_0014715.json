That’s cool. \nRunning back Eddie Lacy is a talented beat boxer — when incessantly egged on. That’s hilarious. \nTight end Justin Perillo credits basketball in aiding his continued growth as a football player. That’s different. \nDefensive back Micah Hyde said he “knows for a fact” he’s “fourth or fifth on the depth chart” at quarterback. That’s interesting — and a scenario no Packers fan wants to see. Sorry, Micah. \nAnd none of them can spell Bakhtiari. That’s amusing. \nSo far, so fun for all of us. \nBut Clubhouse Live can also strike a serious tone at times. Take Monday’s upcoming show in which we’re asking those who attend to wear pink in support of breast cancer awareness. \nWe’ll have items on sale that will benefit Susan G. Komen , like T-shirts and cupcakes. Cash or checks only, please. And we’ll have some cool pink prizes, too. John Kuhn spearheads effort to help homeless mothers \nLook for other details and guest information on our Facebook page at facebook.com/clubhouselive . \nThe award-winning Clubhouse Live is produced by Gannett Wisconsin Media and can be seen at 6:30 p.m. Mondays from The Clubhouse Sports Pub & Grill inside the Radisson Paper Valley Hotel in downtown Appleton. Look for it online, as well, at clubhouselive.com . \nThe fight against breast cancer is an important cause for many. That we can use Clubhouse Live as a way to do some good for the community is a source of pride for our entire team. \nPlease consider attending the show and supporting this movement. \nBrett Christopherson: 920-993-7117, or brett.christopherson@gannettwisconsin.com; on Twitter @PCBrettC 2 CONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://post.cr/1Lw80kQ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:57:38.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
