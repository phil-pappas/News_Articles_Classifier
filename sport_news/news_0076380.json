I won't be going to Vegas for my bye week. I'm not feeling really lucky.\"\nBut Denver's defense bailed him out, and given another chance in overtime, Manning took over. He completed 4 of 4 passes for 39 yards on the last drive. Manning finished 26 of 48 for 290 yards and the one TD, a 75-yarder to Emmanuel Sanders.\nThe score came just seconds after the Browns had taken their only lead on Karlos Dansby's 35-yard interception return for a TD.\nIt was yet another heartbreaker for Cleveland, which had one of the NFL's best teams on the ropes late in regulation before McCown threw a critical interception.\nMcCown, who passed for a franchise-record 457 yards last week, went 20 of 39 for 213 yards with two touchdowns to tight end Gary Barnidge. But his second pick with 44 seconds left in regulation cost the Browns as they were driving for a potential game-winning field goal.\nOn second down at the Denver 46, McCown rolled from pressure before forcing a throw across the field that was picked off by Denver's David Bruton Jr.\n\"It was obviously just not good,\" McCown said of his turnover. \"You have to get something going there. That hurt us because the defense played lights-out today. We didn't hold up our end. It is a shame.\"\nDenver cornerback Aqib Talib had a 63-yard interception return for a TD and McManus kicked four field goals as the Broncos won their 11th straight against the Browns.\nWATCH: Aqib Talib's pick-six vs. Browns\nThis one didn't have much artistic beauty as the Broncos had some dropped passes, penalties and let the Browns hang around.\nBut Manning, as he has done so many times during his illustrious career, found a way to lead his team to the win. His struggles have prompted talk about his career reaching an end, but Denver, relying on its swarming, turnover-inducing defense, is winning without Manning playing well.\n\"We're a good football team that could be a great football team, if we can correct a lot of our mistakes,\" Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said.\nThe overtime came after a frenetic fourth quarter during which Cleveland took the lead on Dansby's interception -- off a pass bobbled by Denver's Ronnie Hillman -- only to have Manning take it back 14 seconds later with his strike to Sanders.\nDenver's dominating defense, missing injured linebacker DeMarcus Ware, came up with another big play in the first half as Talib's return gave the Broncos a 10-0 lead.\nOn the second play of the second quarter, McCown threw a pass toward the right sideline, where Talib was waiting. He made the interception, and after briefly holding the ball out in an early celebration, tucked it away and outran Travis Benjamin to the end zone.\nIt was Denver's fourth defensive TD this season and the eighth of Talib's career.\nHillman rushed for 111 yards on 20 carries. Demaryius Thomas had 10 catches for 111 yards, but let two clutch throws by Manning slip through his hands.\nNOTES: Denver is 4-0 in road games. ... Already missing Ware (back), the Broncos also lost LBs Shane Ray (knee) and Corey Nelson (knee). Ray's injury appears to be the most serious. He left the stadium on crutches and his knee immobilized. ... Sanders hurt his left shoulder while making a catch late in regulation. ... Barnidge is the first Browns TE to catch a TD pass in four straight games since Ozzie Newsome in 1981.\n___\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 6 NEXT SLIDE > Denver Broncos inside linebackers Brandon Marshall (54) and Danny Trevathan (59) celebrate after sacking Cleveland Browns quarterback Josh McCown during the first half of an NFL football game Sunday, Oct. 18, 2015, in Cleveland. © AP Photo/David Richard\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfnixP.img&quot;}}", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfAtvM.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyxle.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Chicago", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfB7eT.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Broncos", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfBA0b.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BBkkQsl&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Jay", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;football_nfl&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:43:15.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
