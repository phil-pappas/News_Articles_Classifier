They alongside Wikki Tourists are the only teams among the four vying for the title yet to lose at home, but they have dropped points four times. \nWith crucial away fixtures against local rivals, Abia Warriors, who they are yet to beat in a competitive outing, and a visit to Sunshine Stars still on the cards, Ikhana's men will have to do it the hard way if they are to lift a record seventh title. \nREMAINING FIXTURES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:49:00.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
