Photo: Eric Jenks Image 12 of 12 CBA tops Albany in first game on Falcons' new football field 1 / 12 Back to Gallery Albany\nBalloons tied to the top of the bleachers ruffled in the wind. The home side of Albany High's new on-campus turf field was filled to capacity. Some fans tailgated three hours before kickoff Saturday.\nIt was a festive atmosphere in which to play football, something that has not always been the case of late for the Falcons.\nEven when it became apparent that the outcome would not involve a victory, the energy and enthusiasm remained. So did the fans.\nBut Christian Brothers Academy spoiled things by scoring five touchdowns in a 10-minute span during the third quarter to break open a tight game in what turned out to be a 49-13 Empire Division victory for the Brothers.\nSaturday represented the inaugural athletic event held on the school's new field, marking the first time the Falcons (0-7 overall, 0-5 Empire Division) played a home game on school grounds.\n\"To actually practice on this field and then play a game on it was a great feeling for all of us,\" Albany junior running back Ky'ere Tillery said. \"The support tonight was really good.\"\nLike so many other efforts this season, Albany started strong and took the lead when Tillery scored on an 8-yard touchdown run in the first quarter.\nTrailing just 14-7 at intermission, things quickly unraveled for the Falcons in the third quarter as junior running back Nick DeNicola scored his second touchdown with a 59-yard scamper up the middle.\nCBA (2-5, 1-4) got the ball back after a Tillery fumble and struck immediately as senior quarterback Joe Kolbe connected with Max Jones on a 50-yard touchdown pass to help establish a 28-7 lead.\nNinety-two seconds later, the Brothers found the end zone again when Luke Anthony recovered a blocked punt. CBA junior two-way standout Taurian Taylor completed the third-quarter scoring barrage with a 70-yard interception return and a one-yard TD run.\nTaylor, who is from Albany, was thrilled to be a part of the first game at Albany's new field. He also loved the way his team seized command in the third quarter.\n\"This gives us even more spark to come back next year and play even harder,\" Taylor said.\nLast week, CBA pushed Empire Division champion Saratoga to the brink before falling 25-24. That loss eliminated the Brothers from playoff consideration after reaching the Class AA Super Bowl in 2013 and 2014.\n\"We played hard. We threw our hearts into it (last week) and we came up short. It kind of hurt, but we made sure we came hard today,\" Taylor said. \"We decided to come out with that same fire (after halftime). Look what happened.\"\nThe Falcons' student section remained raucous and yelled their support as Albany marched 65 yards over 15 plays to score the final touchdown — a one-yard TD plunge by Tillery (game-high 127 yards on 31 carries) with 4:18 left.\n\"There was improvement throughout the season,\" Tillery said. \"We played well in the first half often. In the second half, we put our heads down once we get down. We've got to stay together and stay strong, playing all four quarters.\"\n\"The attitude of the team has been fantastic,\" Albany coach Joey DiPiazza said. \"They work hard in practice. They work hard in games. Being able to deal with adversity during the games, and how you bounce back from things getting to the next play, is what we need to improve on.\"\nCBA coach Joe Burke gently slapped helmets, shook hands and exchanged hugs with Albany players and coaches afterwards. He led the Falcons to playoff appearances in 2004 and 2005 (reaching the semifinals with sophomore running back Dion Lewis , now with the New England Patriots ) and is the most recent Albany coach to register a Class AA win (2007).\n\"It is difficult to come in here and play, being a district employee,\" Burke said. \"I'm good friends with Joey and he's doing a great job. I've seen every game on film. Those kids are playing hard.\n\"Hats off to the district for this facility. The kids deserve it and it is long overdue,\" Burke added. \"I don't care what anyone in the district thinks. The kids deserve to have this facility. The old saying is, 'If you build it, they will come.' They will. It was important for us to get a win, but I didn't want it to come at the expense of Albany.\"\nAfter praising his players for their victory and the emotion with which they competed, Burke asked senior Tommy Vielkind to stand up.\nQuickly, Burke and Vielkind got emotional as the coach explained how proud he was that Vielkind made it back to the field after a three-year fight with leukemia.\n\"It was lovely. TV, man, we love him. We're glad he played,\" Taylor said.\nCBA and Albany, both with young rosters, now gear up for a pair of crossover games.\n\"We've shown we can hang with some of the best teams in the section and how vulnerable we can be at times with such a young team,\" DiPiazza said. \"We're excited. We keep getting better and better. We're going to get over the hump.\"\njallen@timesunion.com • 518-454-5062 • @TUSidelines", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/63/8809693/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/63/8809702/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/63/8809698/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/63/8809701/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/63/8809695/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/63/8809684/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/63/8809699/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/63/8809698/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/63/8809697/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/63/8809695/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/63/8809684/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/63/8809697/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/63/8809700/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/63/8809696/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/63/8809701/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/63/8809696/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/63/8809699/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/63/8809702/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/63/8809694/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/63/8809700/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/63/8809694/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/63/8809693/7/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T07:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:38:23.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
