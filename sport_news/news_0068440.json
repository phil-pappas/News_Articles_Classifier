It was not until nine minutes from the end that Tom Craig increased the lead with an overhead deflection. \nStriker Hugo Inglis closed the gap with a goal from a sharp angle five minutes from the end before Glenn Turner's late goal regained the two-goal margin. \nNick Wilson and Ryan Archibald both went close for the Black Sticks, who felt it had been a good hit-out. \nNew Zealand certainly held some cards up its sleeve before Sunday's match but believed it had gained much. \nFiji thumped Samoa 20-0 in the other men's game, while Australia's women belted their Samoan opponents 25-0. \nThe women's Black Sticks, ranked fourth in the world, had a day off yesterday as they prepare for back-to-back games against second-ranked Australia tomorrow and Sunday. Both those sides have qualified for Rio, so their matches will be more about pride than absolute necessity. \n- David Leggat", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:08:14.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
