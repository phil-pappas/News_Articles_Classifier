With three-eighths (of a mile) to go, he started getting to them. He really hit his stride.” \nThe time was 1:09.82 for six furlongs on the fast track. \nAnnual Report paid $16.80, $7 and $4.20. King Kranz returned $3.40 and $2.80, and Manhattan Dan paid $3.80 to show. \nStellar Path burst out of the pack in midstretch to win the Athenia for fillies and mares on the turf. \nThe gray 4-year-old trained by Christophe Clement and ridden by Joel Rosario improved to 7 for 18, beating 66-1 shot Weiner Valkyrie by three quarters of a length. Stellar Path paid $13 to win. The time was 1:43.41 for 1 1/16 miles on the firm course.
