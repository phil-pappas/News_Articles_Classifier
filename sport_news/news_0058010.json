Read between the lines and that means it is the series that will get the most fans into the Herb Brooks National Hockey Center. \nSo the university, as it used to do with its series against the University of Minnesota, has asked fans who are planning on attending the North Dakota series to buy tickets to at least one of four other games. \nThe other four games are two exhibitions (vs. University of Alberta, Saturday; vs. USA National Developmental Program, Jan. 3) or two regular-season games against Arizona State (Jan. 1-2). \n“It’s supporting our team with some of the other games,” Weems said. “When you have high demand games, you like to try to tie some other pieces in. \n“The tickets for the exhibitions are discounted. We’re trying to provide support for our players early in the season and during our (winter) break period.” \nTickets for the exhibition games are $20-$30, while the tickets for the North Dakota series are $30-$40. \nNo, St. Cloud State is not the lone school to do something along these lines. Take tickets for the University of Minnesota men’s hockey team at Mariucci Arena, for example. You can watch the Gophers play Penn State for $30-$50. It will cost you $40-$50 to see the Gophers play Ohio State. \nIf you want to watch the Gophers play St. Cloud State, Wisconsin, Minnesota State-Mankato or Minnesota-Duluth, the cost per ticket is $60-$70. \nHere are some other notes on SCSU men’s hockey tickets: \nSEASON TICKET SALES \nChad Sheetz, St. Cloud State’s assistant director of athletic business and finance operations/ticket office, said that season ticket renewals from last season are at 89 percent of last season. There were 1,303 full-season ticket packages sold last season, and there are 1,161 sold for this season. \nSt. Cloud State full-season tickets range in price from $169-$425 apiece. There are 16 regular-season home games and the two exhibitions. The $169 seats are in the bench seating areas of the northeast corner of the arena in Sections 201 and 202. \nTICKET PACKAGE SALES DOUBLE \nWhile the full-season ticket sales are down, the packages for half-season tickets have doubled from last season. With a flex pack, fans can purchase tickets for just Friday games or just Saturday games. \nHalf-season tickets for just Fridays range from $80-$185, and $90-$195 for just Saturdays. The cheapest of the half-season tickets also are in Sections 201-202. \nSheetz said that there have been 166 of the half-season ticket packages sold for this season compared to 83 for last season. \nThere also are 3-10 game ticket packages available. \nThe family four-pack package is available for all games except the North Dakota series. For $60 for one game, fans can get four tickets (in Sections 201-202), four hot dogs and four sodas. \nWeems said that the different ticket packaging has evolved. \n“We’ve really tried in the last couple of years to be cognizant of some more affordable options,” she said. “What we’re seeing in college athletics right now is shifting in terms of people’s behavior. \n“I’m a huge believer that you can’t replicate the live experience by sitting in your really comfortable recliner at home with your beverage of choice. ... We’re trying to be more flexible and dynamic in how we do pricing.” \nNORTH STAR COLLEGE CUP \nThe Huskies are back in the North Star College Cup, the midseason in-state tournament that will be held Jan. 30-31 at Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul. \nFans can purchase four-game ticket packages for the tournament at the St. Cloud State ticket office. Tickets are $54 for upper level seating and $80 for lower level seating. When tickets for the tournament that are purchased at St. Cloud State, “most of the money goes back to St. Cloud State,” Sheetz said. \nIf you wait to buy tickets for tournament games and buy them at Xcel, “almost all of the money goes to the Gophers,” Sheetz said. \nIn the opening round on Jan. 30, St. Cloud State plays Minnesota State-Mankato at 1 p.m.; Minnesota plays Bemidji State at 4 p.m. \nOn Jan. 31, the third-place game will be at 1 p.m. and the championship game will be at 4 p.m. \nSt. Cloud State’s ticket office in the Brooks Center is open from 9 a.m.-5 p.m. Monday-Friday or call the ticket office at 877-727-8849. \nThis is the opinion of Mick Hatten.
