Joelle beat Sarah-Jane Perry in straight games.\nJoshana had to dig really deep against 31st-ranked Salma, who had earlier sent out the second seeded Laura Massaro of England.\nSalma had led 7-4 right in the first game before Joshana woke up to find her lengths and repeatedly getting the Egyptian off the T to win points.\nBut Salma was not to be pushed down as she came strongly to win the next two games with some accurate shot-making where the Indian came up with a few unforced errors. The intensity reached a crescendo in the fourth game which Salma in her enthusiasm to close up even went for a dive and hurt herself.\nJoshana kept up the pressure and forced the issue to the fifth game where again points went neck and neck until at 10-9 match ball, Salma sent a forehand drive out of the court.
