(AP Photo/Rick ... more > By JON KRAWCZYNSKI -   \nLast season the Golden State Warriors were invigorated by a new head coach and ran circles around the rest of the NBA, culminating with the franchise’s first title. \nOther Western Conference powers are looking to follow the same script this season. \nThe Oklahoma City Thunder missed the playoffs last season largely due to injuries to Kevin Durant and Serge Ibaka. Both players are healthy this year and new coach Billy Donovan has come in to inject some rhythm and movement into an offense that too often grew stagnant under Scott Brooks. \nThe San Antonio Spurs made an uncharacteristically big splash in free agency by adding LaMarcus Aldridge, the Los Angeles Clippers fortified an awful bench with Lance Stephenson, Josh Smith and Paul Pierce and the Houston Rockets hope they’ve finally found a point guard to take some of the pressure off of James Harden. \nBut with Durant back healthy and looking like his devastating old self in the preseason, Russell Westbrook coming off of a career year and Donovan bringing a fresh new perspective, it could finally be the Thunder’s year. \nOf course, count the defending champions - and about four other teams in this loaded conference - out at your own peril. \nA look at the West: \nPLAYOFF BOUND: \n1. Golden State - Warriors won 67 games last year, dominated on both ends of the floor and return everyone. Going any place else for the West favorite is overthinking it. \n2. Oklahoma City - The duo of Westbrook and Durant is as dynamic as any one-two punch in the league. Enes Kanter provides another scoring option in the paint, but the Thunder will have to show they’re deep enough to get through the rugged West. \n3. San Antonio - Not only did Aldridge come along, but veteran David West took a pay cut of around $11 million to join up in search of his first championship. \n4. Houston - If Ty Lawson can put his alcohol troubles behind him, James Harden and Co. should be right in the mix again in June. \n5. Los Angeles Clippers - Arguably as much talent from top to bottom of any roster in the league. \n6. Memphis - The inability to land some quality perimeter shooting in the offseason may be this team’s undoing. \n7. New Orleans - Anthony Davis got his first taste of playoff basketball last season, and the future face of the league is ready for more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:04:21.079+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
