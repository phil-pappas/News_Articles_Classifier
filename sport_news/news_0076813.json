Tsurenko had a walkover when third-seeded Pennetta withdrew Wednesday citing a leg injury. \nIn the men's event, Marin Cilic of Croatia, seeded first, struggled with his powerful serve during a tough second-round match with Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin. Cilic fought back hard after losing the second set to go 4-0 up in the decider and eventually clinch the match 7-6 (3), 3-6, 6-3. \n\"I've always had trouble with him and the way he plays doesn't suit me perfectly,\" Cilic said of Istomin. \"In the third set I just felt that slightly he just dropped with his game and that was enough for me to make that big advantage.\" \nCilic faces a quarterfinal meeting with Russian Andrei Kuznetsov, who knocked out eighth-seeded Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan 6-1, 7-5. \nFrance's Lucas Pouille won his second-round match against Spain's Daniel Gimeno-Traver 6-1, 7-6 (5). He meets second-seeded Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain in the quarterfinals. \n-- James Ellingworth \nRosol beats former champ Tsonga; reaches Vienna quarterfinal \nVIENNA (AP) — Lukas Rosol of Czech Republic defeated former champion Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 at the Erste Bank Open on Thursday, dealing a blow to the Frenchman's chances of qualifying for the ATP finals. \nAt the start of the week Tsonga was ninth in this year's standings with only the top eight advancing to the season-ending tournament in London in November. \nThe fourth-seeded Tsonga, who won here in 2011, had not lost in three previous matches against Rosol, who next plays another Frenchman, sixth-seeded Gael Monfils. Monfils defeated Paolo Lorenzi 6-4, 6-4 after breaking the Italian's serve twice in each set. \nThe top-two seeded players also advanced, with David Ferrer routing fellow Spaniard Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 6-1, 6-1 and Kevin Anderson of South Africa rallying to beat Jiri Vesely of Czech Republic 6-7 (4), 6-3, 7-5. \nFerrer saved two break points early in the opening set and converted five of eight chances on Garcia-Lopez's serve. \nIn his 12th quarterfinal of the season, Ferrer will play Fabio Fognini, who downed Czech veteran Radek Stepanek 6-1, 6-4. The eighth-seeded Italian broke Stepanek twice in the opening set und used his only break point at 5-4 in the second to close out the win. \nAnderson is next up against Steve Johnson of the United States, who defeated Jerzy Janowicz of Poland 6-4, 6-7 (7), 6-4 for his third quarterfinal of the year and first since reaching the semifinals in Winston-Salem in August. \nBerdych to face Dimitrov in Stockholm Open quarterfinal \nSTOCKHOLM (AP) — Top-seeded Tomas Berdych will face Grigor Dimitrov in the quarterfinals of the Stockholm Open, in a rematch of last year's final. \nBerdych beat unseeded German Alexander Zverev 6-3, 6-4 on Thursday, while the fifth-seeded Dimitrov saw off Nicolas Almagro of Spain, 6-4, 6-4. \nSecond-seeded Richard Gasquet advanced to the last eight after Steve Darcis was forced to retire with a left ankle injury during their second-round match. \nGasquet was leading 6-1, 2-0 at the time. Darcis is expected to feature for Belgium in the Davis Cup final against Britain next month. Gasquet will face fellow Frenchman Jeremy Chardy, after he beat unseeded Federico Delbonis of Argentina 6-3, 7-6 (2). \nSiegemund beats Flipkens to reach quarters Luxembourg Open \nLUXEMBOURG (AP) — Laura Siegemund of Germany defeated Kirsten Flipkens of Belgium 7-6 (2), 6-1 on Thursday to reach the quarterfinal of the Luxembourg Open. \nSiegemund only qualified for the main draw as a 'lucky loser' in qualifying, and advanced to the second round when top seed Timea Bacsinszky of Switzerland pulled out injured during their first-round encounter late Wednesday. \nIn Friday's quarterfinal, Siegemund will play another Swiss, Stefanie Voegele, who defeated Anna-Lena Friedsam of Germany, 6-3, 7-6 (4).
