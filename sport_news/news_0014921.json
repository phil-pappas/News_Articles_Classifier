Dylan Larkin. Dylan Larkin.\nAnd Dylan Larkin.\nHeading into tonight's game against the Carolina Hurricanes, the Red Wings haven’t lost in regulation yet. That includes the preseason and three regular season games. The last time any Red Wing team was defeated in a hockey game, you have to go back to the Red and White Scrimmage at the end of training camp in Traverse City (a 6-2 win for the Red team, for those keeping track at home.)\nOverreacting to a fast start is ill-advised and naive. That said, we all do it. We debated just how good the 11-2 Tigers could be back in April and then they proceeded to go 63-85 the rest of the way. So we’ll hold off just a bit on the Red Wings and previewing their inevitable Eastern Conference Finals showdown with the Panthers (told you we weren’t overreacting!).\nBut if you’ve spent any time around the team or the coaching staff this fall, you get a very distinct feeling about things and it’s quite simply this - a breath of fresh air.\nYou lose the best coach in hockey to your longtime nemesis, and that’s usually a recipe for disaster. But the notion that “it’s time” for Mike Babcock to depart has never been clearer than it was in the last two weeks. New coach Jeff Blashill may sound like Babcock and may call him a mentor. But it’s clear that his tactics and his method for dealing with players is different. As a result, you have a player such as Larkin playing on a top line. You have 35 year-old captain Henrik Zetterberg playing like he’s 25. And you have a slew of young forwards battling for ice time, not giving away a shift or an inch to anybody. As a result, for the first time in awhile, you have the D-word on display in the D. Depth.\nAgain, this is three games in. Early in the season, the games tend to be spaced a little further apart to allow skaters to get their legs under them. And normally, teams start the season healthy. It’s usually January or February (or in Detroit’s case - November) when players start to fall off. Pavel Datsyuk started the year on injured reserve. And, unfortunately, Johan Franzen joined him as symptoms from his string of concussions have crept up again, making all of us wonder just how much longer the 35-year-old will be able to play.\nBut as long as the Red Wings are hot, there’s no use tamping down the excitement. So here’s a list of things, in order, that I’m most excited to see this season.\n1) Did I mention Larkin? Who knows where this career is heading, but when a player is home-grown (Waterford), attends the hometown university (Michigan) and makes it impossible for the big club to keep him down in the minors, it’s impossible not to be excited. I was asked recently the last time Red Wings fans were this excited about a young player. I had to point out that we’re often excited about young players, they just don’t always live up to the billing once they arrive. Larkin, on the other hand, had a goal and an assist in his debut last week and is certainly skating like he belongs.\n2) Teemu Pulkkinen. I heard from plenty of fans who were furious that Babcock didn’t use Pulkkinen more last year, especially on the power play. The counter, of course, is that the power play was No. 2 in the NHL during the regular season. Still, you can see what the Wings might have been missing. He’s active. He has a hard shot. And he’s right-handed. As the Wings try to shuffle their forwards and avoid losing any on the waiver wire, it’s a pretty strong bet that Pulkkinen will be here for the entire ride.\n3) Jimmy Howard and Petr Mrazek. Six months ago, this was a goaltending controversy. Now it’s a goaltending luxury. I thought the Wings should have looked to move Howard over the summer. But general manager Ken Holland and Blashill seem very clear on the fact that these two will share the duties until one grabs it. They tried this last spring and, after a choppy end of the regular season, Mrazek was the Red Wings' best player in the Tampa Bay first-round series. This may end up being Blashill’s biggest challenge in his first season. But unlike in April, this is a great challenge to have. The smart money is on Mrazek to solidify the job. That said, Howard has been counted out before.\n4) The next step. There are four or five players on the roster who have the chance to go from being a good player to a very good one. Gustav Nyquist, Tomas Tatar, Danny DeKeyser, Riley Sheahan and Brendan Smith all seemed primed for breakout seasons. You could say that Nyquist and Tatar have already had theirs, now they’re trying to string two or three together. The younger players have played important roles in the past two seasons. This is the chance for them to be vital.\n5) Zetterberg unleashed. It’s too much to say that Zetterberg detested Babcock. It’s not too much to say that the Wings’ captain agrees with the coaching change. Talking to Zetterberg on the radio last week, you could almost feel the weight that had lifted from his shoulders. He says he’s in the best shape he’s been in years. And he’s responded with a fast start offensively (a league-leading seven points through three games). One of Babcock’s favorite lines is “your best players have to be your best players.\" Zetterberg didn’t fit that description during each of the past two postseasons (his ailing back was part of that). He seems primed to do that this year.\nGiddy overreaction? Probably. But again - we’re talking about the story lines that we’re excited to see play out. They may not all end perfectly. And the dings, bruises and outright injuries will come. But if things go right, which they have so far, this team has the talent to make things awfully interesting.\nCheck out our new Red Wings Xtra app on Apple and Android !\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nRed Wings happy with both special teams during 3-0 run", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/jamiesamuelsen/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3f009c1e5461ecd86bb2c60a54d493e76ab96c91/c=317-0-2872-2555/local/-/media/2015/10/14/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635804283968593955-AP-Lighting-Red-Wings-Hockey.jpg", "https://itunes.apple.com/app/id965245273", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gannett.dolly.RedWings&hl=en"], "published": "2015-10-16T23:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:13:44.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
