If they seal off the edge, I have a clear shot at it. It makes it easier for me, those guys. It’s all about getting a good jump and laying out there and giving it everything you’ve got.” \nIt’s a rarity indeed to block kicks in three successive weeks. \n“It’s been my experience that if they do it once, they do it over and over and over,” Jones said. “I was hoping that that was what would happen. Now, he has that confidence. He goes for it and he knows how to do it.” \nNathan Staton handles the special teams for the Bulldogs, and he planted the idea for Burgess and his special teams’ teammates. \n“Coach Staton does a real good job figuring out the best way to get us clear off the edge,” Burgess said. “We know every week that we have a shot.” \nOpposing teams are now taking steps to prevent it from happening again and even point out where Burgess is lined up. \n“Definitely, they line up a little differently,” Burgess said. “They plan against it. One week, they called me out.” \nNow, of course, the thought of a blocked kick is firmly planted in the other team’s minds. \n“It’s always good to plant the seed,” Jones said. “It’s like going for two (points) on the first touchdown. Now, they have to spend time working on that stuff.” \nFumbles, interceptions, penalties, they all are big in determining outcomes to games, but it just seems like mistakes in the kicking game are magnified. \n“It’s definitely a mood swinger,” Burgess said. “It gets the momentum going the other way.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T12:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:40:59.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
