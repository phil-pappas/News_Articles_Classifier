He proved that this offseason, playing through a stiff back in Games 4 and 5 of the American League Divisional Series. \nBut he'd been proving it all season, slightly under the radar. \nIt was common belief that Beltre's thumb may not have been fully healthy when he returned from the disabled list in late June. \nBut it turns out, Beltre was playing with a torn ligament in his thumb for the entire second half of the season. \nGM Jon Daniels says the injury didn't necessarily require surgery - \"If it had, I think we would have considered going down that path.\" \nBut celary, Beltre was playing through pain. \n\"The prevailing opinion was 'rest'. But that's not really in his vocabulary. So, he played through what ideally he would've had more time to let cool off.\" \nIn the 92 games that Beltre played after returning from his thumb injury, he batted .305, hit 12 home runs, batted in 65 runs, and was one of the key driving forces behind the Rangers run to an AL West championship.
