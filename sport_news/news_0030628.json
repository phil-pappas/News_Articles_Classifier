We’ve played some playoff teams the past few games and (I’m pleased) with his ability to handle some of those things. He’s doing his best to pick up the defensive parts of the game. Not just the way we defend or the systems that we run. There’s a learning curve to that.\n“This is a completely different game than anything he’s seen before, whether it’s junior hockey or European hockey. The speed it’s played at, the size of guys you’re playing against. It’s (about) experience. Over the next three, four or five years, (Ehlers) is going to learn what he can get away with and what he can’t. It’s going to take him some time. But I’m pleased with his interest in (learning).”\nEhlers is set to face off against the Tampa Bay Lightning on Friday at MTS Centre as the Jets continue a six-game homestand.\nThere had been flashes of the skill prior to his first goal, but Ehlers’ confidence seems to be growing daily and is using his speed as a weapon.\nYes, there have been times when he’s been in a prime shooting position and chosen to try and thread the needle instead, but that’s part of the transition process.\n“I’m getting more and more comfortable being out there,” said Ehlers. “To go out there and just play the game, instead of holding back a little bit. Of course, I have to adjust but I feel I’ve done that already. I think it’s going pretty well.”\nObviously, there’s plenty of room for growth — which is something Ehlers goes out of his way to point out in each and every interview he conducts — but the early returns have been solid.\nAnd it’s almost certain that the best is probably yet to come.\nWINNIPEG JETS\nWinnipeg Jets rookie Nikolaj Ehlers looks to build on his strong start\nBy Ken Wiebe , Winnipeg Sun First posted: Thursday, October 22, 2015 07:21 PM EDT | Updated: Thursday, October 22, 2015 07:52 PM EDT\nSo far, Nikolaj Ehlers is living up to his advance billing.\nComing into the NHL season, there were plenty of questions surrounding how smooth the transition was going to be for the Winnipeg Jets first-round pick in 2014.\nThere was also plenty of excitement, given the dynamic skill set that Ehlers was bringing to the table, with his blend of breathtaking speed and finishing ability.\nThe consensus was that since he’d already produced consecutive 100-plus point seasons with the Halifax Mooseheads of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, Ehlers would be given every opportunity to make the Jets.\nHe wasn’t going to be handed a job outright, of course, but he’d pretty much need to fall flat on his face to not get at least the nine-game look before a decision would be made on his future.\nWhile it’s still incredibly early in the process, it’s safe to say the Jets won’t need to look at a Plan B regarding where Ehlers will end up this season.\nE\nAbout the author Ken Wiebe Ken Wiebe's Blog Follow Ken Wiebe on Twitter Other Stories Lightning strikes in overtime as Winnipeg Jets fall\nOvertime was wide open and the Tampa Bay Lightning made their best chance count.\n0\nByfuglien's dramatic goal gives Winnipeg Jets home-opener win over Calgary Flames\nThe Winnipeg Jets never had a doubt the decisive goal was going to count, even after it went to review.\n0\nSee more from Ken Wiebe »\n Hockey Lightning centre Steven Stamkos' future up in the air 0\nOilers Pakarinen gets his look 0\nOttawa Senators suffer late-game meltdown, fall 4-1 to Coyotes ", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://twitter.com/@WiebeSunSports", "http://blogs.canoe.ca/thebrawl/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-23T07:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:31:07.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
