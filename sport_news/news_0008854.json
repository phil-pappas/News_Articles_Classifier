The world’s No. 3 player had numerous birdie chances and didn’t convert nearly as many as he would have liked. What pleased McIlroy was the quality of his game from tee to green, which was far crisper than it was at the Tour Championship three weeks ago.\n\"Definitely a step in the right direction today,\" McIlroy said.\nVegas, who won as a rookie in 2011 at the Humana Challenge, lost his card this year and failed to get it back at the Web.com Tour Finals two weeks ago. He is relying on his limited status as a past champion and sponsor exemptions, so it was important to make the most out of his exemption this week.\nHarold Varner III, who joins Tiger Woods as the only players of black heritage on the PGA Tour this year, made a strong rookie debut with a 65. Martin Laird had the best score of the afternoon to join Varner at 65. The group at 66 included Justin Thomas, with Justin Rose among those at 67. \nSouth Korean shoots 10-under \nINCHEON, South Korea — South Korea’s Sung Hyun Park shot a course-record 10-under 62 to take a four-stroke lead in the LPGA KEB Hana Bank Championship.\nPark, 22, birdied three of the last four holes after making six birdies in a seven-hole stretch in the middle of the round on Sky 72’s Ocean Course.\nMaking her first LPGA Tour start, Park played alongside Michelle Wie and Lexi Thompson and often drove past the long-hitting U.S. stars. Thompson had a 68, and Wie shot 71.\n\"I thought it was not an easy course, but my tee shots, my iron shots, my putting, everything just went really well,\" Park said through a translator.\nRanked 54th in the world, Park won the Korea LPGA’s Se Ri Pak Invitational two weeks ago for her third victory of the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:48:07.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
