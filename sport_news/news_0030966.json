USC head coach Steve Sarkisian got upset by his former team. Oh, and Oregon lost again at home. \nHere's a look at each matchup. California (5-1, 2-1) at Utah (5-0, 2-0) \nScore: Utah 30, Cal 24 \nGame recap: From the get-go, the Utes' defense destroyed Cal quarterback Jared Goff. The star quarterback threw a career-high five interceptions. Overall, Utah had a 6-3 edge in the turnover margin. But the No. 4 team's running back also caused problems for the Bears. The 23rd-ranked team couldn't handle Utah's No. 23 as Booker had his best game of the season. Also, with less than 30 seconds on the clock and 21 yards from a win, it was Utah's defense that saved the day on a Cal fourth down. Moral of the story: Defense still wins games. \nKey stat: Booker reached his second career 200-yard game with 222 yards on 34 carries. He scored two touchdowns and also caught four passes for 45 yards. \nConference implications: Cal almost kept its unbeaten record. If anything, this game comes as a learning experience. Utah has one of the best defenses in the country, leading the nation in turnover margin. So yes, there was a plentiful amount of picks, but the fact that the game came down to the wire speaks volumes. The Bears continue their Pac-12 journey as they prepare to play UCLA, USC and Oregon in upcoming weeks. \nJust as expected in preseason — OK not really — Utah remains the only undefeated team in the Pac-12. There is a lot of football left to play, and the Utes are well aware of that. But it's hard not to ooze confidence when you've traveled the road Utah has this season. The Utes now welcomes Arizona State, which sits behind them in the South division. \nNext opponent: Cal takes its bye and travels to UCLA Oct. 22; Utah hosts Arizona State. Colorado (3-3, 0-2) at Arizona State (4-2, 2-1) \nScore: Arizona State 48, Colorado 23 \nGame recap: With 7:12 left in the first quarter, the Sun Devils had the upper hand at 14-7. That was the closest the score would be for the rest of the game. Quarterback Mike Bercovici led Arizona State to a 24-10 halftime lead. The Sun Devils returned to the field determined to finish as they scored on their first two possessions of the second half. \nKey stat: Bercovici completed 20 of 31 passes for 260 yards with five touchdowns, tying a career-high, and one interception. \nConference implications: Colorado's past came creeping in this game. Hello, 90 yards in penalties. The Buffaloes made it hard for themselves with a nonexistent offensive line. Colorado's line allowed quarterback Sefo Liufau to be sacked eight times and surrendered 12 tackles for loss. It'll be a long journey if the Buffs can't learn to overcome their mistakes. \nThe Sun Devils are inching their way into the talks of the Pac-12 South title. They hold second place in the South thanks to a two-game winning streak. Now they prepare to face Utah, a team they have had success against. If Arizona State can pull off the upset, the Pac-12 South standings will scramble, and we'll have ourselves a conference shakeup. \nNext opponent: Colorado hosts Arizona; Arizona State travels to Utah. Oregon State (2-3, 0-2) at Arizona (4-2, 1-2) \nScore: Arizona 44, Oregon State 7 \nGame recap: Hoping to make a comeback from its two-game losing streak, Arizona did just that. Quarterback Anu Solomon made his returned after suffering a concussion a couple of weeks ago. But it was the Wildcats' running game that overwhelmed the Beavers. The score was 34-7 at the half, and the rest is history. \nKey stat: Arizona pounded 284 yards and five touchdowns on the ground thanks to Nick Wilson, Jared Baker and Orlando Bradford. \nConference implications: Coming off a bye, Oregon State head coach Gary Andersen hoped his team would rally. Many improvements need to be made to this team, which ranks last place in the North. \nArizona is hanging onto the division talk ropes. A healthy Solomon is reassuring, as is the effective run game. The defending Pac-12 South champions have some \"easy\" games coming up so it's a wait and see to find out what these Wildcats are truly made of. \nNext opponent: Oregon State travels to Washington State; Arizona travels to Colorado. Washington (3-2, 1-1) at USC (3-2, 1-2) \nScore: Washington 17, USC 12 \nGame recap: Just like Los Angeles traffic — which stalled fans' arrival to the game — USC's loss to Washington left the Trojans and their fans with headaches. The Huskies came to the Coliseum as a 17-point underdog and left with 17 points, five more than the Trojans. \nKey stat: USC converted just one-third down on 13 attempts. \nConference implications: First off, let's get it clear that Washington's defense looks good. The offense wasn't as smooth, but the Trojans were outcoached, and that's what won the game. Let's see if Washington can continue to do that and move up in the Pac-12 North rankings. \nPeople will forever wonder why USC would try for a field goal on fourth down. Even with a successful kick, it would still have to score again to win. The Trojans are struggling in many ways, and it seems that any hope for a division title is slipping away. \nNext opponent: Washington hosts Oregon; USC travels to Notre Dame. Washington State (3-2, 1-1) at Oregon (3-3, 1-2) \nScore: Washington State 45, Oregon 38 (2OT) \nGame recap: With one second left in regulation, the Cougars made a PAT to tie the game. They were down 10 with less than six minutes remaining. Not only did Washington State survive overtime at Autzen Stadium, but it did so again in a second. Oregon got called for unnecessary roughness, helping Washington State's field position. Quarterback Luke Falk threw to River Cracraft, but the ball came out of his hands and right into the hands of Robert Lewis. Lewis was credited for a 4-yard touchdown to seal the win. \nKey stat: Falk finished with a season-high 505 yards and five touchdowns. He also targeted 10 difference receivers. \nConference implications: Washington State is third in the Pac-12 North behind Stanford and Cal. Although it wasn't consistent throughout the contest, the team was clutch as ever when it mattered. Just make sure you don't ever count the Cougars out. \nOregon's season continues to dwindle. The Ducks' recent play isn't near the team that went to the College Playoffs last season. Quarterback Vernon Adams Jr. was once again out of the game with a broken finger, so it was Jeff Lockie and Taylor Alie trying to #WinTheDay. Oregon will play Washington in a North battle before heading into its bye, which is much-needed. \nNext opponent: Washington State hosts Oregon State; Oregon travels to Washington. 0 Pending", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:43:42.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
