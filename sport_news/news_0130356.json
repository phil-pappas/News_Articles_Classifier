The lone Utah State win in the series came back in 1967 in San Diego. Head coach Rocky Long and the Aztecs are looking to keep the series dominance going. \n\"I think our team is pretty excited about Friday night,\" Long said at his weekly press conference earlier this week. \"Obviously we have great respect for Utah State because they're playing really well. What they did to Boise State last week was pretty impressive, so we know it's going to be a challenge. But again, it's going to be an opportunity, too. We've been playing pretty well the last three weeks as well, so it should be a good game. I hope a lot of people come out and watch it.\" \nLong thinks that Utah State's defense will also provide the toughest challenge for his offense this year, but only because they don't play Boise State. \n\"Probably, since we don't play Boise State this year. Boise has an outstanding defense also, but Utah State is really good on defense. They've been good for a long time, probably the last three or four years they've been really good on defense. They've got about three outstanding linebackers and their defensive line is really strong.\" \nUtah State does rank sixth in the nation in rushing defense at 91 yards a game, 20th in total defense allowing just 303 total yards a game and 31st in scoring defense, giving up just over 20 points a game. \nLong is more concerned about the unique Utah State offense and quarterback Kent Myers who has shown he can do it both on the ground and through the air so far this year. \n\"He's just as dangerous doing both. He's a great carrier with the ball and he's really fast. It's the best team speed that we'll play against since the Cal game,\" Long said. \"They're unique on offense, and they block schemes purposely so that the quarterback can carry the football. He runs power plays. He runs sweep plays with lead blockers and he runs counter plays with lead blockers. \n\"All the time they're sending guys in motion to give a fly-sweep look,\" he added. \"They're very unique on offense and it's all about giving the quarterback a chance to carry the ball no matter what you do on defense.\" \nLong isn't the only one worried about how to stop Myers and the Aggie offense. Junior linebacker Calvin Munson also talked about the challenges Utah State presents to a defense. \n\"It's almost like you're playing a wildcat team,\" Munson said. \"He runs a lot. He pulls it from his running backs. He's almost as big of a threat to run as he is to (hand off). We're going to have to be really disciplined this week. We're going to have to know all of our assignments and play assignment football. You can't try to make a big play and go away from your assignment because that's when the big plays are going to happen against you. (We're going to) play assignment and play hard.\" \nWith such a big game coming to San Diego, Long is hopeful that there will be enough of a crowd to have an effect on the game. \n\"I don't know what to expect. I hope so,\" he said. \"I hope we get a big crowd, and I hope they're all for us because that's the one advantage we have. We're playing at home and if you have a big crowd that's very supportive, they can get you through some bad times. Just the energy in the building gets you through some bad times, so I hope so.\" \nUtah State kicks off its second of three straight Friday night games on Oct. 23 at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California at 8:30 p.m. MT. It will be televised on ESPN2. \nParker Robertson is a graduate of Utah State University, a freelance contributor and an avid fan of sports.
