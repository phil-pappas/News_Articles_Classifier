The 33-year-old pitcher scuffled in the second half, going 5-3 with a 5.10 ERA, and Hammel lasted just 3 innings in his Game 4 NLDS start against the Cardinals.\nThe Cubs beat St. Louis 6-4 to set off a wild party at Wrigley and advance to the NLCS, but Hammel allowed 2 runs on 3 hits and 3 walks before making yet another early exit.\nWith so much riding on Wednesday's start against the Mets, Hammel knows he has to stay relaxed and pitch better.\n\"Pressure is what you make of it, and I honestly believe if I'm pressuring myself, I'm worried about the wrong thing,\" Hammel said. \"I'll be prepared with my gameplan, go back and watch what I did when I faced the Mets earlier this year and we'll kind of go off that.\"\nOn May 13, Hammel beat the Mets at Wrigley Field while pitching 8 innings and allowing 1 run on 5 hits.\nAfter facing power right-handers Matt Harvey, Noah Syndergaard and Jacob deGrom in the first three games of the NLCS, the Cubs get rookie lefty Steven Matz Wednesday.\nMatz made his first postseason start on Game 4 of the NLDS against the Dodgers last Tuesday and struggled, allowing 3 runs on 6 hits in 5 innings.\nMatz has never faced the Cubs.\n\"I think it's going to be a lot of fun,\" he said. \"I've never been here before or played here before or never even seen a game here. I'm really excited.\"\nDuring the regular season, Matz made 6 starts for New York and was 4-0 with a 2.27 ERA. He missed six weeks with a torn lat muscle earlier in the season and has also dealt with back soreness.\n\"He's got to stay healthy, No. 1,\" New York manager Terry Collins said. \"This guy's got plus stuff. He's got a plus fastball. He's going to be 94 to 97 (mph). He's got a plus curveball. He's got a good changeup. Now it's a matter of going out there every five days through the course of the season.\"\nâ€¢ Follow Scot's reports throughout the playoffs on Twitter at @scotgregor.\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
