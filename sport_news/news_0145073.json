The two seniors are out four to five weeks and will mostly likely miss the rest of the season. \nGunderson said he thinks the rest of the team made it through the Cut Bank game without anymore season-ending injuries. He complimented backup quarterback Collin Achenbach who played well for the Bulldogs in the loss. “Collin is a fighter and he’ll do whatever he can to make things happen,” Gunderson said. \nIn last week’s loss, Choteau faced a tough Cut Bank defensive line with players weighing an average of 260 pounds. Cut Bank held Choteau to just 209 total yards, including 89 rushing and 120 passing. On offense, Cut Bank totaled 313 yards rushing and 50 yards passing for a total of 363 yards. \nThe Bulldogs were penalized seven times for 53 yards. Cut Bank was penalized seven times for 67 yards. \nGunderson said that even though Choteau has a size and experience deficit, the kids have fight, determination and a positive attitude that will help them overcome that deficit. He also said that Choteau was able to move the ball when all the players executed on offense. \nOn defense, he said Denver Krone, Ben Roeder, French, Layton Lockwood and Chase DeBoo all stepped up and played hard against Cut Bank on defense for the Dawgs. \n“We’ve got kids who are stepping up. We just have to put it together for the whole game,” he said. \nIn the Cut Bank game, Choteau got the first offensive position but was forced to punt after a costly holding call on second down. After Choteau’s punt, the Wolves started their first scoring drive from their own 38 yard line. On a fourth-and-two play, senior quarterback Nate Wynn broke through Choteau’s secondary and ran 54 yards for the touchdown to put Cut Bank up, 6-0 with 7:50 remaining in the first quarter. Choteau’s defense stopped the two-point conversion attempt. \nCut Bank then kicked to Choteau and senior Collin Achenbach returned the kick to Cut Bank’s 46-yard line giving the Bulldogs great field position. With Achenbach quarterbacking for the injured Derrek Durocher, the Bulldogs moved the ball down the field on carries by Steeler French and a pass to Taner Stone for a 13-yard gain. Choteau was hurt by a holding call and helped by an illegal helmet contact call on Cut Bank. On second and 14, Achenbach kept the ball and scrambled to the two-yard line. French then found a hole in Cut Bank’s line and scored on a two-yard touchdown run. Trevor Moore’s kick went wide and the score was tied, 6-6 with 2:46 left in the first quarter. \nThe second and third quarters belonged to Cut Bank as the Wolves’ defensive scheme shut down Choteau’s running game. Achenbach scrambled on several keepers, dished off to French and passed several times to Stone and Marshall Willekes but couldn’t put together a scoring drive. Costly holding and false start penalties also plagued the team. \nCut Bank scored again in the second quarter after taking over on downs on its own 13. Senior running back Jace Berkram eluded Choteau defenders and ran in a 78-yard touchdown. Again the extra points attempt failed, but Cut Bank took a 12-6 advantage into the locker room at halftime. \nThe Wolves scored again on their first possession of the third quarter as Wynn put together a 12-play scoring drive from their own 35 yard line that culminated with his 32-yard touchdown pass to Keaton Anderson. With the extra points attempt failing, Cut Bank led, 18-6, at the end of the third. \nChoteau’s final score came at the beginning of the fourth quarter when the Bulldogs took over on downs on their own 22 yard line. Achenbach led the Bulldogs down field in 16 plays, alternating between handing off to French and keeping the ball himself. He also completed two passes, one to Trevor Moore. On fourth and 4, Achenbach kept the ball and ran in a nine-yard touchdown. The PAT failed, and Choteau trailed, 12-18, with 6:17 left in the quarter. \nCut Bank scored again with 1:35 left in the game to go up, 24-12, and Choteau was not able to put together another successful drive. Choteau started on their own 24 but a fumble on the snap resulted in a loss with Choteau facing second and 22 from the 12-yard line. Achenbach connected with French on a big pass play getting the team to the 50 yard line, but penalties for false start and an illegal forward pass plus a defensive sack of Achenbach stopped the drive. \nSTATISTICS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:27:07.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
