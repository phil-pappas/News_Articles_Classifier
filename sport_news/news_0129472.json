Cam Coffman threw for 213 yards and three touchdowns and Brian Hill rushed for 188 yards as the Cowboys beat Nevada 28-21 on Saturday afternoon.\nCoffman completed 18-of-20 passes with no interceptions at War Memorial Stadium and had 32 yards rushing for Wyoming (1-6, 1-2 Mountain West). It was the Cowboys' first win since they beat Fresno State 45-17 last Nov. 1.\n\"I couldn't be happier for our players,\" said second-year Wyoming coach Craig Bohl. \"A young football team is going to recognize that good things will happen. This win is a credit to their character.\"\nHill posted his fourth-highest rushing total on a career-high 33 carries and has gained more than 100 yards in nine of his last 12 games.\n\"I feel like we have finally figured it out,\" he said. \"It's an exciting feeling right now.\"\nTyler Stewart completed 25-of-41 passes for 287 yards and two TDs for Nevada (3-4, 1-2). His 7-yarder to Jerico Richardson, who made a juggling catch while falling backward, drew the Wolf Pack within 28-21 with 6:36 remaining.\nNevada forced a punt, but Stewart was sacked by D.J. May on fourth-and-5 from the Cowboys' 36-yard line with 1:36 left. Wyoming blitzed and Eric Nzeocha knocked the ball from Stewart, but the QB recovered and was drilled by May for an 18-yard loss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:22:32.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
