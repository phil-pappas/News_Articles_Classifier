The four FBS teams they've beaten have a combined record of 12-18. Their lone loss came to a South Carolina team that's under .500 and had its coach bail two weeks ago. \nAnd Saturday's win came with many reasons to be leery. North Carolina had 13 penalties for 135 yards and had a pair of turnovers. \nWith a trip to No. 25 Pittsburgh followed by a home game against No. 23 Duke, the next two weeks should provide a clearer picture of where the Tar Heels stand. \nBut here's the thing. The Tar Heels don't care about collecting believers. They've got enough faith in themselves. \n\"I think we have a very good football team, I really do,\" North Carolina coach Larry Fedora said. \"I've said it before, I think that the chemistry, the leadership, the locker room, I think that's what's driving this football team.\" \nMuch of that optimism stems from a vastly improved defense. Saturday's win offered a glimpse as to why. \nAfter allowing 497.8 yards per game last season, the Tar Heels had given up just 349.3 per outing coming into Saturday. But in the first half, there were flashes of the Tar Heels' old form. \nAt halftime, Virginia had compiled 133 rushing yards. Coming into Saturday, they'd been averaging 112.2 per game. The Cavaliers - whose only two wins came in overtime against struggling Syracuse and to William & Mary of the FCS - were level with the Tar Heels at 13-13. \nDuring the break, first-year defensive coordinator Gene Chizik didn't uncork a heated speech or overhaul the Tar Heels' defensive strategy. Instead, he calmly pointed out a few plays that were hurting the Tar Heels and trusted his players to stop them. \n\"We just fixed it,\" Tar Heels defensive back Malik Simmons said. \"It wasn't like there were any schematic adjustments, we just fixed our mistakes.\" \nThe result was a second half that saw the Tar Heels hold the Cavaliers scoreless and wring five turnovers out of Virginia's six possessions. \n\"The second half was great, we played the way we felt we should have and could have the whole game,\" linebacker Shakeel Rashad said. \nVirginia's first second-half possession ended when North Carolina defensive back Sam Smiley hauled in a badly overthrown pass and returned it to the Cavaliers' 16, leading to a North Carolina field goal. \nAfter forcing a Virginia punt on the next possession, the Tar Heels ground out a 93-yard, 13-play drive that ended with a 3-yard Elijah Hood touchdown run. \nSimmons got Tar Heels the ball back when he picked off a pass that deflected off a Virginia receiver, leading to another field goal. \nAnd when Virginia drove to the Tar Heels' 4-yard line, the defense came through again as Rashad came down with a pass in the end zone. \nOn the Cavaliers' next possession, North Carolina's Mikey Bart hit Cavaliers quarterback Matt Johns and forced a fumble, which was recovered by teammate Robert Dinkins. In the final minute, Simmons picked off another pass, cementing the win. \n\"We look back to last year and we might have crumbled in situations like today,\" quarterback Marquise Williams said. \"We pulled it together, pulled tight as a team, offense, defense, special teams, we all came together.\" \nStaff writer Stephen Schramm can be reached at schramms@fayobserver.com or at 486-3536.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:47:43.580+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
