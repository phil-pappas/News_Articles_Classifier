Florida's Grier suspended 1 year for positive PED test FILE - In this Oct. 3, 2015, file photo, Florida quarterback Will Grier warms up before an NCAA college football game against Mississippi in Gainesville, Fla. A person familiar with the situation says Grier has been suspended indefinitely for violating the NCAA's policy on banned drugs. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the school has not announced the decision. Grier is considering an appeal. (AP Photo/Phelan M.
