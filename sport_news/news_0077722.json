This was her fourth top-10 finish of the year, and third in her last four starts.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to getting a win,\" the Taiwanese golfer said.\n\n\"I came to Asia for these five weeks looking for a win and I know every week is getting closer,\" she added.\n\nTseng hopes victory will finally come on home soil, when the LPGA Tour's annual Asian swing takes in the Fubon LPGA Taiwan Championship starting Thursday.\n\nSouth Korean Park Sung-Hyun, who set the course record with a 10-under 62 in the first round, had shared top spot on the leaderboard going in to the final round.\n\nBut bogeys on the third and 12th and just a single birdie on Sunday saw her pipped at the post by Thompson.\n\nIn joint fourth place was South Korean Amy Yang who equalled Park's 10-under course record to shoot up the leaderboard.\n\nYang birdied every hole on the back nine, matching the LPGA record for most consecutive birdies in one round.\n\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T17:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:29:08.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
