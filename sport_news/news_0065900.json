This dog-friendly spot is easy to find, well-maintained and suitable for all ages and fitness levels. Explore local outdoor fitness options with #Trailblazers Michelle Mulak Stunning views and plentiful wildlife make the Ritch Grissom Wetlands a perfect place for a run, walk or bike ride. Well-maintained, easy to follow trails are wheelchair, stroller and dog-friendly. Viera Wetlands offer stunning views from almost every angle on their 3.5 mile trail system. (Photo: Michelle Mulak) \nTrails so nice, they named them twice. \nThe Viera Wetlands, also known as the Ritch Grissom Wetlands, is a man-made treatment wetland system that has become a bird-watching destination and hiking haven just steps from the edges of Viera. The wetlands were renamed in 2007 in memory of longtime Brevard County employee Ritch Grissom, who worked at the water treatment facility next to the wetlands. #Trailblazers: Dog-friendly places to walk and run \nThe hard-packed dirt trail system wraps around a lake and surrounding marshy property that is rife with a diverse population of birds, turtles, alligators and other wetland wildlife. This has become a popular spot for bike riding, running and walking and for good reason: It’s stunning, especially this time of year. As the temperatures have begun to drop and the wind has picked up, this should definitely be a spot you explore or re-discover. \nStory continues below \nThe trails around the Ritch Grissom Wetlands are ideal for hiking, running or cycling. (Photo: Michelle Mulak) #Trailblazers: Chain of Lakes Park \nThe wetlands offer about 3.5 miles of dirt and grassy trails, with several loops to choose from that are suitable for people of any fitness level. This is a dog-friendly location, though you should absolutely keep your furry friend on a short leash. I saw two alligators during my visit, one of which was on the grass within 10 feet of the trail. \nKnow Before You Go: There is no shade on these trails, so plan your sun protection accordingly. Dangerous wildlife — such as alligators, snapping turtles and snakes — are commonly seen near the trails. Do not try and take a selfie with these creatures! Use common sense and steer clear. If there is a dangerous critter on the trail, turn around and go a different route. No fishing or hunting is permitted on site, paddle boarding is not recommended. The smell of the water treatment facility next door can sometimes be mildly foul. No worries, you’ll get used to it and forget all about it once you start walking. \nThe Basics: Viera Wetlands is well-suited for hiking, trail running, and riding a hybrid, mountain or cruiser bicycle. The trails are almost completely flat, well-marked and easy to follow. The system is wheelchair and stroller friendly, and dogs are allowed (on a short leash). The wetlands are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily, with the no admission permitted after 6:30 p.m. There is no cost for using the trails, but there is a donation box near the entrance. If you love this place as much as I do, consider pitching in a few bucks for maintenance. \nChallenge Factor: Low to moderate, depending on the distance you cover. There are several loops of varying distances, all flat. If you trek all the trails onsite, you will have covered about three and a half miles. Certain times of year, sections of the trail are closed when conditions become waterlogged or dangerous. \nAdded Bonus: This site is part of the Great Florida Birding Trail. Bring your binoculars and spend a few minutes on the observation deck or take a quiet repose on one of the plentiful benches and watch as wildlife emerges from the tall marsh grass. The 200-acre conservation area is used as a polishing system for water reuse, making it as functional as it is stunning. \nGetting There: From I-95, take exit 191 and head west on Wickham Road. Go straight through the traffic circle and follow the road passed the restricted gates of the water treatment facility. The main entrance to the gate will be straight ahead. *Please note: the road near the entrance is called Charlie Corbeil Way. US National Grid location 17R NM 2330 2255. Always know your USNG location when utilizing trails. For more information on USNG visit www.usngcenter.org \nFinding Viera Wetlands is easy. Head west on Wickham Rd. and you'll run right into the park. (Photo: Courtesy Google Maps/ Michelle Mulak) \nMichelle Mulak is the fitness & water reporter for FLORIDA TODAY.
