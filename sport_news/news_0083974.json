Villa travel to Tottenham five days later in the Premier League. \nSky understands that Garde, who is out of work after taking a sabbatical when he relinquished his role at Lyon last year, is the clear favourite to become the club's third manager in eight months. \nGarde's odds of taking over are 1/4, according to Sky Bet, while Real Sociedad's David Moyes (5/1), former Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (8/1) and ex-Leicester manager Nigel Pearson (10/1) are next on the list. \nVilla's owners will be desperate to see their new manager reignite their league campaign after they suffered a sixth successive league defeat on Saturday against Swansea, while Sunderland's victory left Villa bottom on just four points after 10 games. \nSky Sports reporter Pete Colley, who was at the Villa training ground, said: \"There have been discussions with Garde who's been a TV pundit since leaving Lyon. We think the talks between him and Villa are quite far down the line.\" \n\"They have also been chatting to David Moyes, they've made contact with Brendan Rodgers - all the managers you'd expect that are out there and available. But Garde is the hot contender at the moment.\" \nSome reports have questioned the role of Villa's sporting director Hendrik Almstadt, who worked with Fox at Arsenal, and Coley believes his role may affect the next appointment. \n\"There's not a question mark over his future,\" Colley added. \"But if you look at West Brom, they had a head coach and a committee to pick players. They opted for Tony Pulis who tore down the structure at West Brom. \n\"If Moyes and Rodgers came to Villa they would not want a committee to choose players. That rules out 'old school' managers like Moyes and Rodgers and it points towards the modern European head coach, which is why I'd put Remi Garde as the head contender.\" \nAlan McInally, who played for Aston Villa from 1987-89, believes Moyes, who is currently managing in La Liga with Real Sociedad, would be the perfect choice to turn fortunes around. \n\"I think David Moyes is a terrific manager,\" the Sky Sports football pundit said about the former Manchester United boss. \n\"I don't know if anyone could have done the job right [at United] after Sir Alex Ferguson. I think he would be a fantastic choice if they could prise him away.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T13:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:22:16.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
