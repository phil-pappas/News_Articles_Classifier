I’m tired. I feel like I played five matches.” \nLexington had to play volleyball again just two days after being shook by a tough loss. The team wasn't at its sharpest, but it still took care of Clear Fork 25-18, 25-15, 25-14 Thursday night. \n“It was kind of tough because we beat ourselves in the end of the game. We missed a lot of serves. (The Red Riders) played a great match, but not always the best team wins in the fifth match,\" Mackenzie said. \"We played our butts off and we worked really hard to come back from that. \n“Tonight we’re a little tired and a little drained, but this gave us confidence going into next week.” \nThe coach said they will spend part of Friday's practice going through individual meetings where end-of-season goals are re-addressed. \n\"All the kids played hard. I don’t doubt my kids’ effort ever. They fight, but they make it hard. Why do they make it so hard?\" Bobbi said. “I’ve got good kids. They come in and buy in and we’ve just got to get better between our ears, and in big moments we’ve got to be the ones that say enough is enough and go.” Buy Photo \nLexington's Mackenzie Weaver spikes the ball Tuesday night during a match against Orrville.
