We can't wait. \n\"We just want to get out on the pitch, try to perform well again and then celebrate with the fans. \n\"A lot of us have had bad nights playing for Wales, and we all want to play on Tuesday night.\" \nWales have climbed to eighth in the FIFA world rankings after a two-year period in which the Bosnia defeat was their first in competitive football for over two years. \nThey will be in the bottom pot of seeds in December's Euro 2016 draw because of their low UEFA coefficient rating, but Williams believes reaching the finals is only the start for the current squad. \n\"I think it's an important message that we need to send out to the group,\" Williams said. \n\"It took so long to qualify but it isn't job done - it's the start of something else now. \n\"We need to focus on continuing to do well and keep on qualifying. I've already spoken to the gaffer on the plane back about plans going forward. As a group that's what we need to concentrate on. \n\"We want this to be a springboard. We all understand how hard it's been to qualify and we've now done it. \n\"But it would be a shame to feel that's all we want to achieve as a group. \n\"We've got a talented bunch coming through, so we want to maintain it. We need to make sure it's the start of good things.\" \nWilliams said in-house celebrations after qualification was confirmed by Cyprus beating Israel in Jerusalem were kept to a minimum on Saturday night. \nAnd he added the squad paused for thought to remember the late Gary Speed, who was Wales manager until his death in November 2011. \n\"We haven't celebrated too much because we knew we had Andorra and we want to be in the best place to play that game,\" Williams said. \n\"We've held off a little bit and I'm sure we'll have a good night after the game. \n\"Speedo is definitely in our minds at all time when we play for Wales. \n\"I think he did start a process. He changed a lot of things, so he's always someone we think of. \n\"We mentioned him after the Bosnia game and also Dai Williams, our kitman, who passed away in January and who we loved as well. \n\"We did it for those two as well because they were both massive for us.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:07:35.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
