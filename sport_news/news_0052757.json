(Ron Chenoy-USA TODAY Sports) \nThe Oakland Raiders have been a treasure trove of fantasy points for opposing tight ends. They have allowed 18.7 points per game to the position, five more than the next worst team, the New York Giants. \nIn Week 1, Bengals’ tight end Tyler Eifert was targeted 12 times, making nine catches for 104 yards and two touchdowns. \nIn Week 2, Ravens’ tight end Crockett Gillmore caught 5 of 6 for 88 yards and two touchdowns. \nIn Week 3, Browns’ tight end Gary Barnidge caught 6 of the 9 passes thrown his way for 105 yards and a score. \nIn Week 4, Bears’ tight end Martellus Bennett caught 11 of 13 passes for 83 yards and a touchdown. \nThis week, Owen Daniels of the Denver Broncos gets a shot. \nDaniels has a touchdown in each of the last two games and gets some looks in the red zone from quarterback Peyton Manning. \nIt all comes down to the two tight end formation, which is a staple of Kubiak’s system. \n“ You force a defense to make a decision ,” Daniels explained to Cameron Wolf of the the Denver Post. “Do they want to keep their base personnel in there to stop the run or do they want put a nickel guy in there to stop the pass. Either way, whatever they decide to do we have to make them wrong. We have had a lot of success with that specific personnel grouping.” \nThat success should continue on Sunday.
