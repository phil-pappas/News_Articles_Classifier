The sky is falling!\nRex Ryan took over as coach of the Bills with a 51-53 (.490) record. What did you expect to be different this time around? The defense has regressed significantly and he promoted a quarterback deficient to being a successful NFL quarterback. The secondary is a joke. Stephon Gillmore has no sense where the ball is and simply can’t defend. The problem still remains Doug Whaley. He needs to go.\nRon Topolski\nLancaster\nThe sky’s not falling! The sky’s not falling!\nThe Bills lost last Sunday. Oh, gloom, despair and agony on me, deep dark depression, excessive misery. They are the worst team in football; they’re cooked; the fat lady has warbled; no half-full glass - it’s empty. They’re toast; stick a fork in ’em. We will end up 2-14. That thundering sound you hear is Bills fans jumping off the bandwagon, shrieking and running away in horror. And look, there goes Jerry Sullivan running ahead of the defectors, white flag of surrender held high.\nWe’re 2-2, can you believe it? We only beat the lowly Colts (what have they ever done) and Dolphins. What an embarrassing blowout first from the Patriots, whom we had always roundly defeated in past years, and now the Giants. Why we have the same miserable record as the Colts, Steelers, Chargers, Cowboys, Ravens, Giants and Seahawks. What losers we have for company.\nDid you read where C.J. Spiller got an 80-yard TD pass to help the Saints beat the Cowboys? Why don’t we bring him back, trade the Saints Watkins, McCoy, all those losers and maybe toss in Ryan while we’re at it, and maybe next year’s first-round draft pick?\nWell, wait a minute. Maybe Sunday these undisciplined losers can pull themselves together and beat the mighty Tennessee Titans, (don’t let that 1-2 record fool you) who have a Hall of Fame quarterback (maybe we could trade for him by next weekend). Then by golly we’d be on our way to the Super Bowl. Except the following week we have to play the undefeated Cincinnati Bengals, who must be the best team in all of football.\nOh gloom, despair and misery on me, I’m a Bills fan.\nCharles L. Bland\nBurt\nBills are reaping what Rex has sown\nRex Ryan has just what he wanted, a team of bullies. Unfortunately, bullies are never properly disciplined. The coach is a bully, and so becomes his team.\nStupid penalties took away a chance for a comeback against the Giants.\nThe Jets are off to a good start since the bully came to Buffalo. Rex has been an undisciplined bully for so long now, it’s hard to believe he’ll ever change his attitude. And as long as the leader remains that way, so will the players he rubs it off on.\nSo don’t expect the Bills to improve to a contender with an undisciplined pretender as their coach.\nRon Solomon\nCheektowaga\nDead one week, revived the next\nFirst off, great article in Monday’s News by Tim Graham. Well written and spot on.\nSomeone must have a sense of humor at the News. If you look at the bottom of the front page Index, it shows the Obituaries on page B4. This directs you to the NFL Monday in the sports section. A Freudian slip but very funny and appropriate for a post mortem of the game. The Obituaries were on page C4.\nStop the train horn. Get enough of that around Hamburg and the surrounding area.\nThe Giants defensive coordinator didn’t have to work overtime to figure out a Rex Ryan team. I understand that coaches have their strengths and systems but isn’t the mark of a great boss/leader/coach one who is able to capitalize on the strengths of the personnel he is dealt? The Bills have an offensive nuclear arsenal with the likes of Taylor, Woods, Williams, Hogan, Clay, Dixon and Harvin.(I wont forget McCoy and Watkins either!). Ryan should have allowed Tyrod to execute the winning formula we have.\nInstead, running on first and second down and then the pass. What a surprise to the Giants defense. Not. When you have a running game or a passing game as your strong point, you use one to establish the other, keeping the defense off guard and guessing what’s next. The minute the running strategy did not work, changes needed to be made and not wait until the fourth quarter to do so. And with Tyrod’s ability to run, still another dimension to the game.\nMr. Graham states that penalties cost the Bills two touchdowns. What was the score? 24-10, a two-touchdown spread. The Bills are capable of so much more.\nWilliam Knab\nHamburg\nNFL has obligation to get things right\nIt is the NFL’s fault. After Monday night’s game, it is time for the NFL to look at their process of ... everything. This is a billion dollar industry. There is no reason why they cannot make sure all rules are followed and the game does not end until it’s 100 percent sure the calls are correct. The call on Monday night could cost a team, maybe not Detroit but another NFC team, a playoff spot and millions of dollars. All because the NFL does not go the extra step. That game should have been stopped, call made correctly, continued on.\nDeflategate is a perfect example. Brady picks his footballs and gives them to a $20-per-hour guy not associated with the NFL and the NFL is trying to suspend him? How about suspending Goodell? How about paying a qualified NFL employee to guard these footballs that the quarterbacks “approved.” Umpires rub up baseballs, pitchers don’t touch them prior to the game. Get a handle on this game, “NFL.” A billion-dollar industry and you treat it like $100!\nDavid Carver\nAmherst\nBased on early results, in Tyrod he trusts\nDoug Whaley has made several big bets in his short tenure as GM of the Bills. McCoy, Incognito, Clay, Bryce Brown, Harvin, Sammy Watkins, etc. Some have worked out and some haven’t. But if the Tyrod Taylor signing is ultimately successful, it would be the most important transaction since the Bills selected Jim Kelly in the 1983 draft.\nI have read that it takes three or four games for the league’s defensive coordinators to get a “book” on new quarterbacks, so time will tell. The Giants game, especially in the first half, seemed to bear this out. In the meantime, Tyrod appears the real thing and is exciting to watch. The Bills may have finally found their answer for the most important and hard to find position on the team. Lets hope.\nLou Speranza\nHamburg\nSend comments to Sports Talk, The Buffalo News, One News Plaza, P.O. Box 100, Buffalo, NY 14240.
