The Rangers signed him in January 2011, a month before his 17th birthday, and pointed him toward the major leagues. He made his debut three years later in May 2014 at age 20 and this year was the Rangers’ opening-day second baseman.\nAfter a rough month when he batted only .144, Odor was sent back to Class AAA Round Rock to work on pitch selection. He had 25 strikeouts in 90 at-bats to go with only seven walks.\nRefusing to grow despondent over his demotion, Odor rediscovered his swing in the minors and came back as one of the better second basemen in the major leagues. On the day he returned, June 15, he went 3 for 3, and from there until the end of the season he batted .292 with 15 home runs, 52 runs batted in and an .861 on-base plus slugging percentage.\nOver all, he batted .261 with 21 doubles, 16 home runs, 61 R.B.I. and a .465 slugging percentage. The 16 home runs were the second-most by a second baseman under the age of 22, according to the Rangers’ statistical information. The Hall of Famer Bill Mazeroski had 19 in 1958.\nSome of Odor’s postseason accomplishments, based on age, are also remarkable. In Game 1, he became the third-youngest player to homer in his first postseason game. The youngest was a 21-year-old Jimmy Sebring for the 1903 Pittsburgh Pirates in the World Series, and Brian McCann did it for the Atlanta Braves at 21 in the 2005 National League division series, 19 days younger than Odor.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Odor’s home run, off David Price, was merely one moment. Odor had so many in Toronto it was difficult to keep track. Before the homer in Game 1, he was hit by pitches twice and scored both times, willing himself, as Banister noted, the next 270 feet.\nIn Game 2, he was even better. In the second inning, he walked, and then, when Chris Gimenez hit a high chopper, Odor noticed no one was covering third, and he passed second base in full stride and did not stop running until he slid safely into third.\nHe then scored on a shallow sacrifice fly by deploying an amazingly skillful slide. The throw from center fielder Kevin Pillar was nearly perfect, but Odor extended his left hand, then pulled it back as catcher Russell Martin went to apply the tag.\nAt top speed, Odor yanked the left hand back and reached around with his right hand and touched home plate safely with his clawlike sliding glove. Martin seemed stunned, but he did not argue.\nOdor wears the glove on his hand because of an injury to his right middle finger in which he tore a fingernail and missed five games in late August.\n“I just want to protect it,” he said. “I don’t like it, but I have to use it.”\nIn the 14th inning, with two outs and the score tied, 4-4, Odor was almost tagged out at second base when the Blue Jays threw behind him. According to the umpires and the replay officials, Odor’s foot never came off the bag. Replays showed his spike clinging to the base, but moving, and it was simply impossible to see if it actually lost connection with the base.\nThousands, if not millions, of Canadian fans disagreed with the umpires, but Odor scored the eventual winning run on a single by Hanser Alberto.\nOdor said he was not worried even slightly while the umpires checked the replay. He said he knew his foot never came off the bag. The way he had been playing, it was not surprising it went his way.\n“Some guys get intimidated,” Napoli said. “He’s not intimidated at all, even on this stage. It’s been really nice to watch. He’s a young kid that fears nothing.”\nLoading... Go to Home Page »\nSite Index The New York Times News World U.S. Politics N.Y.
