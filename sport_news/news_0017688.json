Linebacker Gionni Paul has been looking forward to Saturday's game since last season.\nUpcoming Games Utah Football Utah football stats & schedule ASU @ Utah Rice-Eccles Stadium, Salt Lake City Oct. 17, 8:00 p.m. 1 Day 12 Hrs 55 Mins 33 Secs More Coverage Utes wary of improving Arizona State team Doug Robinson: Are the No. 4-ranked Utes good, lucky or both? Enemy camp: 5 questions with an ASU beat writer SALT LAKE CITY — For some of Utah’s defensive players there is more on the line this Saturday night than a chance to stay undefeated. Linebacker Gionni Paul, cornerback Dominique Hatfield and safety Marcus Williams have created a little extra incentive to try and turn the game in Utah’s favor through takeaways.\nA goal board in the defensive unit room gives each defensive player points for the positive plays they make each game. And, as one might imagine, takeaways offer players the most points.\nWilliams has led most of the season, but Paul is one great performance from overtaking him.\n“They’re within 10 points,” said linebackers coach Justin Ena. “That’s a good game or a bad game. That’s very, very close.”\nEna grinned when asked about the competition the three players were engaged in, as he didn’t know about it.\n“That’s all new to me,” he said, laughing. “That’s pretty awesome. Competition is awesome.”\nThe competition seems to be working because Utah has 12 interceptions, which is tied for first in the Pac-12 and third in the nation. The Utes have 17 takeaways this season and are tied for best in the nation with a turnover margin of plus 2 per game.\nSo what coveted prize does the leader earn?\n“Push-ups on demand,” Paul said, laughing. “So if I’m walking to the bus, even if I’m tired, he can ask me to drop and give him push-ups.”\nHe said creating turnovers is something they focused on since last season ended. This just makes the stakes a bit higher.\n“It makes us play better,” Paul said. “It makes us play with more passion.”\nWilliams said it only makes them more motivated to do what they’ve been working on all offseason.\n“It’s just something fun,” Williams said. “Competition is always good, just to push each other to that extra higher (level), whatever you have.”\nSPECIAL MEANING FOR THOMPSON\nSaturday’s game is this season’s Ute Proud celebration, and for at least one Utah player it has special significance. Senior quarterback Kendal Thompson is a member of the Kiowa Tribe (Oklahoma) through his mom, who is half Kiowa.\n\"It's definitely a big deal for me,\" he said. \"My great aunt and cousin, they're all coming out to the game (Saturday).\"\nThompson said his family's timing is a coincidence, but it doesn't diminish how much more special the celebration of Ute heritage will be for him knowing his family will be in Salt Lake City to experience it with him.\n\"It's definitely an important thing to me,\" said Thompson, who was given his Kiowa name this summer. He told Indian Country Today in September that it means \"Little Wolf\" and was passed down from his great-grandfather, making it especially meaningful.\nA week before the team takes on Arizona State, Thompson said he lived with his grandparents when he was a child while his dad was playing football in the NFL's European league. \"My grandfather has passed away, but he was like a father figure to me,\" he said. \"It's hard for me to speak on things I didn't live through, but I can appreciate that. ...When I play that's something I pray about all the time; that's his heritage, it's my heritage, and I think about it all the time.\"\nThe football players will wear a Ute Proud decal on their helmets and members of the Ute Tribe will attend the game and be recognized. Fans are encouraged to purchase Ute Proud T-shirts, the proceeds of which fund a scholarship and youth programs for the Ute Tribe.

I took losing (last year) kind of personally. I marked my calendar and said, ‘They ain’t going to beat us this year, even if I have to take it upon myself.’”\nEmail: adonaldson@deseretnews.com\nTwitter: adonsports", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html", "https://www.deseretconnect.com/task/story/id/"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:07:20.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
