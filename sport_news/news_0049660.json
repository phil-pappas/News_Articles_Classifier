(AP Photo/Charles Krupa) \nBOSTON (AP) — Chris Thorburn and Nicolas Petan scored in the third period after Boston came within one goal, and the Winnipeg Jets opened the season with a 6-2 victory over the Bruins on Thursday night. \nIt was the first victory for the former Atlanta Thrashers in Boston since 2007, before the franchise moved to Winnipeg. The Bruins had beaten the Thrashers and Jets 13 consecutive times in Boston. \nOndrej Pavelec made 29 saves for the Jets. Mark Scheifele, Blake Wheeler and Drew Stafford scored in the second period to give the Jets a 3-1 lead. \nDavid Pastrnak stickhandled along the left side before wristing it past Pavelec to make it 3-2 early in the third. But less than four minutes later, Thorburn sneaked through the defense and put a bouncing puck past Rask to make it 4-2. \nPetan deflected a puck off his skate and into the net midway through the final period to make it 5-2. He added an empty-netter with 3:38 to play, backhanding it in from the far faceoff circle. \nDavid Krejci also scored for Boston, and Tuukka Rask made 26 saves. \nThe Jets are trying to build on last season’s playoff appearance — their first since moving to Winnipeg before the 2011-12 season. They were swept by Anaheim in the first round. \nThe Bruins are trying to bounce back after missing the playoffs last season for the first time since 2007 — the year before Claude Julien took over on the bench. General manager Peter Chiarelli was replaced by Don Sweeney and regulars like Milan Lucic and Dougie Hamilton were shipped out. \nBut with top defensemen Zdeno Chara and Dennis Seidenberg missing the games with injures, the Bruins struggled to keep the puck out of their net. \nNOTES: Chara, the Bruins’ captain has an unspecified upper body injury, and Seidenberg had surgery to repair a herniated disc. … Boston’s Jonas Kemppainen and Winnipeg’s Nicolas Petan and Nikolaj Ehlers made their NHL debuts. … The Jets open with four road games in six nights, including two back-to-backs.
