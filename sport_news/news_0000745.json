It's something that no other team around here has done.\"\nBut Beckett, a linebacker, and Harvey, a defensive back, feel differently about it now after transferring from Oscar Smith to Indian River since last season. The Tigers, ranked second in South Hampton Roads, and No. 4 Indian River meet at 1 p.m. Saturday in a game moved to Hickory to accommodate a large crowd.\n\"Now I don't care about the streak,\" Beckett said. \"Now I just want to end it.\"\nOscar Smith last lost to a Southeastern District team Nov. 3, 2006:\n23-15 vs. Hickory.\nCoach Richard Morgan also has helped lead the Tigers to at least a share of the past 11 district titles and 110 wins in their past 112 district games.\nNo team in South Hampton Roads can come close to those numbers. Ocean Lakes has won 36 consecutive Beach District games in a row and Lake Taylor has won 30 straight Eastern District games.\n\"Over the years, some teams have really stepped up and challenged us,\" Morgan said. \"Grassfield had a great team in 2009 and we beat them twice. And in 2012, King's Fork had a great team and challenged us and we were able to beat them in overtime. So there have been games that other teams played really well and took us to the point of almost losing, but we were able to overcome it.\"\nIndian River coaches and players also know the significance of the Tigers' streak.\n\"It just speaks volumes about their coach,\" said Indian River coach Glenwood Ferebee. \"We give respect where respect is due. We're not going in there disrespecting them because that's how you lose. So we give them the respect that they deserve, but at the same time we're trying to go in there and win a football game.\"\nHarvey knows Indian River faces a big challenge. The last time the Braves beat Oscar Smith was 1998.\n\"Oscar Smith has been a powerhouse for I don't know how many years,\" he said. \"They've always been good and always dominated. For us to even get the chance to break the streak this year feels good.\"\nBoth Harvey and Beckett still have good friends who play for Oscar Smith, although the teams have shared some jabs on social media in recent weeks.\n\"I was really close to a few players,\" Beckett said. \"I still have good friends there, but I don't think they're allowed to talk to me.\"\nMorgan, meanwhile, has downplayed the hype of the game, saying the Tigers are \"just playing another district game.\"\n\"Honestly, I haven't told them anything about the streak,\" said Morgan, who has a 103-3 record against Hampton Roads teams during the past eight seasons. \"We've been in state title games, national TV games and we've been on the big stage for the last 14 years. So this is just another regular-season game in the Southeastern District. We're not thinking any different.\"\nWhile Oscar Smith has played on big stages, Ferebee admitted that most of his players haven't played in a game of this magnitude.\n\"The thing that Beckett and Harvey bring is that they've been in that environment before,\" Ferebee said. \"They understand what's at stake and how to play in it.\"\nBeckett, an All-Tidewater linebacker, said a win would prove Indian River is an elite team. Oscar Smith, has won 164 games since 2000 and has 12 straight playoff appearances. Indian River, which endured five losing seasons before going 8-4 last year, has been to the playoffs only four times since 2000.\n\"It's time to prove to people that haven't gotten a chance to see us play that we are a top team in the Southeastern District,\" Beckett said. \"And to be the best, you've got to beat the best. And with all due respect, they have been the best for so many years. Now we want to prove it's our time.\"\nLarry Rubama, 757-446-2273 larry.rubama@pilotonline.com , Twitter@LHRubama\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image.
