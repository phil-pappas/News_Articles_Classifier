In his annual Dussehra address at RSS headquarters here, Bhagwat hailed Dalit ikon B R Ambedkar for making provisions in Constitution to remove social and economic inequality faced by the weaker sections, a reference to the quota system, whose review he had recently suggested that pushed the BJP on the backfoot in Bihar polls. In his 55-minute speech, telecast live by Doordarshan for the second consecutive year, he also called for a holistic discussion on population, saying its continuous rise becomes a burden. \"Small episodes happen. They get exaggerated and presented in a big way... Small incidents keep happening but it does not distort Indian culture, Hindu culture. Since time immemorial, it respects diversity, coordinates among diversities to establish unity... This is Hindutva,\" he said. \"Our country has stood as one and will stand as one. The Sangh has been doing the work of keeping the nation one on the basis of Hindutva for the last 90 years,\" he said. Bhagwat, however, refrained from making any direct reference to recent incidents of communal and caste tensions. With several fringe Hindutva elements repeatedly demanding a curb on Muslim population, Bhagwat, without naming any community, favoured a \"uniform population policy which is applicable to all\". He deplored that no holistic discussion has taken place in the country on controlling population. \"With rise in population, the burden on the country will grow. Population growth can be an asset too. If we have more mouths to feed, we will also have more hands to work. We have to plan for 50 years hence. How to provide for the education and health of the people,\" he said. Praising the Centre, he said it had brought about hope and confidence among people that had hit rock bottom under the previous government and spoke about the pet schemes of the Modi government like Jan Dhan, Swachh Bharat and Mudra bank. RSS chief 'viceroy' of NDA govt, says Cong Congress leader Manish Tewari on Thursday described the RSS chief as the viceroy of the incumbent NDA government, and added that it was not unexpected or unusual for Bhagwat to praise the latter. “There are two institutions in this country. There is a Prime Minister and a viceroy, and Mohan Bhagwat is the Viceroy of this government. So, it is obvious that the Viceroy is going to praise Prime Minister Modi, (and) there is nothing new about it,” Tewari said. Janata Dal (United) leader Ali Anwar said the BJP is the only party that cannot decide its own policies, as the RSS fully controls it. — PTI/ANI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:29:55.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
