I think Keyes showed his spirit and he led our team to victory.” \nKeyes showed his courage against a stingy Huskies’ defense, as he completed his first two passes. The second one ended up as the Bears’ initial score, as he hit Daniel Hunter for a 61-yard touchdown reception. \nOn his third pass of the game, Keyes found Michael Mitchell for a 30-yard reception, which then set up Austyn Borre for his first of two touchdown runs. \nHowever, Keyes tossed a pick-six in the second quarter to the Huskies’ Brian Sutton-- and Dieruff next tied the game up thanks to its own air-attack. After that sequence, Keyes didn’t take long to give the Bears the lead right back. With 19 seconds left until half, Keyes found Justin Richardson for a 28-yard touchdown reception. \nAlthough he said it took a little while to get comfortable in the pocket, his actions soon served as the best medicine for his nerves. \n“Stepping in was hard at first because I was a little nervous, but I knew what I had to do,” Keyes said. “I knew the reads that I had to do and the receivers just got open because we have very athletic receivers.” \nDieruff made things interesting early in the second half by pulling within a point, after Devante Robinson broke free for a 75-yard touchdown run on the second play from scrimmage. \nPacchioni’s move proved to be a good one, as Keyes once again hooked up with Hunter for another score. \n“The quarterback made some great throws,” said Pacchioni, of Keyes, who finished with 11 completions on 16 attempts for 232 yards and three touchdowns. “You give our receivers good opportunities to catch the football and they can do some magic with it. They (PV receivers) made the best of the opportunities and we scored some points.” \nHowever, Pacchioni wasn’t happy with the way a bad week of practice carried over into Homecoming night. \n“They gave us trouble,” Pacchioni said. “I said it all week, “People are saying ‘you’re going to blow them out.’ No, they’re a heckuva a team. They may be 1-5, but they have some great athletes.” \nLAST MINUTE PICK...With 38-seconds left in the game, BJ Olaniyan picked off a Nizayah Speaks pass and returned it for a 62-yards to paydirt. \nA LITTLE BIT OF DEJA VU...Just like last week’s game with ES South, PV’s opponent this week again committed a ton of penalties. The Huskies recorded eight of their 14 penalties over the first 12 minutes of play. \nQB BATTLE...Pacchioni and his coaching staff will have a touch decision to make regarding who gets the nod next week at QB. Keyes is ready for the challenge, “It’s going to come down to competition we do in practice. Whoever performs well in practice will get the job.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:34:53.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
