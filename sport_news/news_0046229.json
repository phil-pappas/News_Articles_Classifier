Defensive backs Manny Romero , Ja’Quan Jones and Jayshawn Grant all intercepted Franklin quarterback Pernell Williams. \nRELATED : Phillipsburg QB Zach Ringhoff out indefinitely with a broken thumb \n“Frank (Duffy) did a great job all week,” said P’burg coach Ryan Ditze, whose team improved to 4-1. “We had great schemes. Guys were running to the football. We’ve improved defensively, which is great to see. I think our defense has caught up to our offense, and that’s going to make us a very good team.” \nField position played a big part as Elizabeth (3-2) was constantly pinned deep in its own territory. \n“I don’t think they started any drives outside the 20,” Ditze said. “Brendan Grube (who kicks off) did a great job kicking the ball. And it was great coverage by the kids.” \nThe shutout was P’burg’s first since a 33-0 win over Mendham in last year’s NJSIAA North 2 Group 4 playoffs. But it didn’t come easily. Elizabeth penetrated to P’burg’s 25 late in the second quarter before Marinelli and Troxell combined to sack Williams to end the drive. \nElizabeth was on P’burg’s 12 early in the fourth quarter when Williams was intercepted by Ja’Quan Jones, who proceeded to run it back 65 yards to set up a 27-yard field goal by Grube. \n“As a senior, it’s great to get that first goose egg at home,” Marinelli said. “It’s amazing to get a shutout in front of the student section and fans we have.” \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com .
