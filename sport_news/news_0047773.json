Alvina Alston, publicist for JaNean Mercer, Odom's maternal aunt and godmother, said that Odom spoke a greeting and gave a thumbs up Friday morning, his first communication since being hospitalized. Odom has been unconscious at a Las Vegas hospital since being found Tuesday at the Love Ranch brothel in Crystal, Nevada. Alston said Mercer is the sister of Odom's late mother who helped raise him in New York, where she still lives. Mercer and other family members, including estranged wife Khloe Kardashian, are in Las Vegas at the hospital. A source also tells CNN that Odom spoke today, specifically, that he said \"hi\" to Khloe. But TMZ 's sources are still saying Odom is not speaking and that any movements he makes are \"involuntary,\" per doctors; the gossip site does report, however, that his heart function has improved and he is being weaned off life support , though it's not yet clear whether he'll be able to breathe on his own. Meanwhile, Khloe said her family won't be posting content online while attending to Odom's health crisis. Kardashian's rep confirmed Friday that a message on the reality TV star's official app was posted by the family. It read: \"As a family, we've decided to hold off on publishing content across our apps while we continue to support and pray for Lamar.\" In this April 30, 2012 file photo, Khloe Kardashian Odom and Lamar Odom from the show \"Keeping Up With The Kardashians\" attend an E!
