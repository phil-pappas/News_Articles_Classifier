Both companies have denied any wrongdoing.\nAttorney General Maura Healey said last week that fantasy sports don’t violate any state or federal laws, but said she wanted to meet with company representatives to address issues around consumer protection.\nGov. Charlie Baker — speaking this morning following testimony on charter school legislation — said he doesn’t consider himself “to be smart enough” to address how the industry could be regulated, noting that, like DeLeo, he wants to hear more from Healey.\n“I do think the consumer protection stuff is important,” Baker said. “The fact that there was somebody who made ($350,000) and worked for DraftKings and had access to information on DraftKings and did that on Fan Duel, I think is a problem.”\nDraftKings and FanDuel have also been on a television ad spending spree, racking up $107 million for commercials in September alone, according to media ad tracking site ispot.tv, which reported nearly half of ad spending last month went to national NFL broadcasts airing on CBS, Fox, NBC, ESPN and the NFL Network.\nDeveloping ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:17:11.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
