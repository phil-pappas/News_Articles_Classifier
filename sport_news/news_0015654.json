(Video) October 20, 2015 0 0 \nEither something weird happened with a microphone during ESPN’s Monday Night Football pregame show this week, or legendary NFL coach Mike Ditka lifted a cheek and let out a rumble. \nAs the panel was making its picks and laughing about how Cris Carter picked the Giants because the Eagles traded him, Ditka leaned over and we heard something that sure sounded like a fart. The way Carter looked at Ditka made it seem more likely that the 76-year-old had, in fact, laid one down. \nWe will say this — that sounded a lot more like a fart than the sound that was made during a recent Jim Tomsula press conference where people accused him of passing gas . And Ditka has done other things on set that should be reserved for the privacy of one’s home, so we wouldn’t put it past him. \nAt least he picked the game right.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:05:27.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
