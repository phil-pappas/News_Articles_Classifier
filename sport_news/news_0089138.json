Records indicate he graduated in 2009 from a high school catering to troubled and special-needs students. Multiple media sources reported Friday he left behind an angry note that is now in the hands of investigators.\nThe Los Angeles Times said Harper-Mercer's note was several pages long and talked about his anger and depression.\nSofia Camarena of Long Beach, California, told The Oregonian/OregonLive that she used to date Harper-Mercer's father.\"I used to change Chris' diapers when he was a baby,\" she said, upset after learning that he was the shooter in Thursday's massacre and was himself dead. \"He was born with problems. He was hard to discipline. If you told him 'no,' he would scream like you had just hit him.\"\nCamarena said that she had heard Harper-Mercer's mother was having \"a hard time\" with him and that he attended a special school.\nCamarena said she last saw Harper-Mercer when he was 18 and she had asked him how he was doing. \"He said he was doing good,\" said Camarena, whose son went on to marry Harper-Mercer's step-sister.\nThere are a number of indications that Harper-Mercer had mental health or behavioral issues. His screen name on some social media sites was \"lithium love.\" Lithium is used as a psychiatric medication.\nOregon School Shooting: Neighbor Interview Neighbor said he saw the shooter hang out every night at the apartment complex swingset with the same two little kids.\nHarper-Mercer graduated from The Switzer Learning Center in 2009, according to a graduation listing in The Daily Breeze newspaper. Switzer Center is a private, nonprofit school in Torrance, California, geared for special education students with a range of issues from learning disabilities, health problems and autism or Asperger's Disorder, according to the school's website.\n\"They take in students that are referred to them by the surrounding school districts,\" said Thomas Buescher, former chairman of the Switzer board. Enrollment typically ranges between 90 and 100, Buescher said. Two-thirds come from a nontraditional household, like a group home or foster home, according to Buescher, who said a high proportion also come from low-income homes.\nA neighbor told The New York Times that Harper-Mercer's mother had told a neighbor, \"My son is dealing with some mental issues,\" and was intolerant of roaches that had infested the building.\nWitnesses said Harper-Mercer singled out the religious during the shooting. He reportedly asked students and staff their religion and shot those who answered they were Christians.\n The U.S. Army confirmed Friday it discharged Harper-Mercer just halfway through his 10 weeks of basic training in 2008. \"A review of Army records indicate that Christopher Sean Harper-Mercer was in service at Ft. Jackson, S.C., from 5 November-11 December 2008 but discharged for failing to meet the minimum administrative standards to serve in the U.S. Army,\" said Lt. Col. Ben Garrett.\nGarrett declined to elaborate on what those \"minimum administrative standards\" were.\nAmid the dysfunction, there were also hints of normalcy. Harper-Mercer found a home of sorts at the Umpqua Community College Theater Arts Department. He worked as a set designer for the department's spring musical. He took a theater class this summer, confirmed Dr. Rita Cavin, Umpqua Community College interim president, and was listed among the set crew for the department's fall production of Blithe Spirit.\nRebecca Miles, a 20-year-old student and Roseburg native, worked with Harper-Harper on last spring's production. \"I painted and worked on the set with him,\" said Miles, who declined to actually speak his name. \"He was a little socially awkward. But he was nice, friendly.\"\nHarper-Mercer was born in the United Kingdom, stepsister Carmen Nesnick told CBS Los Angeles , moving to the United States when he was very young. He grew up in the Torrance area. His parents, Ian Bernard Mercer and Laurel Margaret Harper, divorced in 2006. Harper-Mercer's family voiced shock and sadness, both about his death and the victims' fate.\n\"In these acts of anger I don't think you can find any one answer,\" said Anntionet Day, Harper-Mercer's stepsister in a written statement. \"I don't know why he targeted Christians. I really wish that we could have helped him before he felt the need to hurt so many people. I do not condone his actions, but he was my brother, I loved him and we ask that you let us grieve as well.\"\nThis article will be updated throughout the day. -- Mike Rogoway, Jeff Manning, Laura Gunderson and Nick Budnick", "external_links": ["http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2015/10/01/man-suspected-in-school-shooting-massacre-in-oregon-had-ties-to-torrance-relatives-in-tarzana/", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/03/us/chris-harper-mercer-umpqua-community-college-shooting.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=a-lede-package-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0"], "published": "2015-10-03T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:44:19.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
