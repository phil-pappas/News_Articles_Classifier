Picture: Sarah Reed.\nRICHARD EARLE The Advertiser REDS defender Craig Goodwin says Adelaide United isn’t spooked by its winless start to a season of great expectation.\nAdelaide is under early pressure to win having posted uninspiring home draws against Melbourne Victory (0-0) and Western Sydney Wanderers (1-1).\n“We’re not really too worried, it has been two draws, the performances have been OK but there is still a lot to work on,” said Goodwin, with Adelaide privately confident it can better last season’s third placed finish under Josep Gombau.\nThe club’s early work has been hampered by some key omissions in its line-up.\nLoan striker Eli Babalj is out for six weeks with a foot injury and skipper Eugene Galekovic is scheduled to return in round seven from a knee injury.\nItalian defender Iacopo La Rocca is also out, while veteran forward Bruce Djite is battling to prove he’s overcome a knee injury ahead of Sunday’s clash.\nGoodwin said Adelaide was taking time to settle into a tinkered game plan under new manager Guillermo Amor and the addition of winger Mate Dugandzic and Babalj.\n“I think it’s just getting into that rhythm of playing more and more games and getting used to each other,” said Goodwin.\n“Once we do that and once we get those combinations going in the front third, I think we will be right.”\n Reds on the right track: Goodwin", "external_links": ["http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/football/reds-are-on-the-right-track-and-wont-be-spooked-by-draws-says-craig-goodwin/story-fnii0g1d-1227575875368", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/447f00d6a38e3b377aabd65121ddaa55", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T13:47:54.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
