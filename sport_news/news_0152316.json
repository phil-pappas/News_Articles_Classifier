(AP Photo/John Raoux) ORG XMIT: GVP (John Raoux / Associated Press) Edgar Thompson Contact Reporter Orlando Sentinel The Gators allowed 500 yards and gained just 151 during a 36-17 loss at Missouri in 2013 \nGAINESVILLE — Will Muschamp's calling card was defense. But Florida's offense was the Achilles heel of the former UF coach — and ultimately his undoing. \nDuring Jim McElwain's first season, the two sides of the ball have combined to form a pleasant, at times perfect, marriage — one without the underlying mistrust and acrimony of recent seasons. \nNever has the union been stronger under McElwain's watch than Saturday night against then-No. 3 Ole Miss. With more than 90,000 of their closest friends on hand in the Swamp, the Gators put on one of their most-complete performances in years. \nWhile the offense scored on four of six first-half possessions after opening with a three-and-out, the defense played with a level of intensity the high-scoring Rebels could not match during a 38-10 loss. \n\"It was as good a defensive performance as I've probably ever been around,\" McElwain said. \nFlorida senior linebacker Antonio Morrison, who tied a career-high with 16 tackles, said the defense's dominance began with offense's success. Sophomore Jalen Tabor and Quincy Wilson have graded higher than the two-time All-SEC selection (Edgar Thompson) \nThe Gators' defense usually played at a high level under Muschamp and finished among the nation's top 10 units the past four regular seasons. Yet, those defenses often felt overburdened by the team's offensive ineptitude. \nWith Grier and Co. clicking like they did against Ole Miss, Morrison said the defense could just let loose, knowing the offense has its back. \n\"Man, it helps a lot,\" Morrison said. \"We get to rest as a defense. We're used to forcing a three-and-out, going to sit down and get a minute and then you're right back up on punt team. You know what I'm saying? Smith's return a ringing endorsement of Jim McElwain's program (Edgar Thompson) \n\"We're forcing a three-and-out and we get to relax. Our offense is doing a great job of moving the ball down field, sustaining drives and not getting three-and-outs. That's very impressive, and that's something that I haven't had since I've been here.\" \nMcElwain said the offense has a lot of room to grow. But it helps to know the Gators should never be out of a game. The defense allows an average of just 15.3 points in league play. \n\"Good teams really care about each other and feed off of each other's success, and maybe misfortune,\" McElwain said. \"Because of it, kind of, maybe I've got to elevate here a little bit, and I think that's a good thing.\" \nFlorida is riding a wave of momentum sure to crash at times in the coming weeks. Each side of the ball could need a lift as early as Saturday night when the No. 11 Gators (5-0, 3-0 SEC) visit Missouri (4-1, 1-1). \nThe Tigers have beaten the Gators the past two seasons and piled of 500 yards of offense at home in 2013. Meanwhile, Florida's offense squeezed out just 151, the most glaring example of the disconnect between the two units during Muschamp's tenure. \nMizzou quarterback Maty Mauk, then a redshirt freshman back-up, led the way with 310 total yards and a touchdown passing and running. But Mauk is suspended for Saturday's game. \nFirst-year freshman Drew Lock will make his second start against a Florida defense that leads the SEC with 13 sacks and 31 overall tackles for loss during conference games. \n\"We've just got to get in his face, push the pocket on him, just make it dirty for him,\" Florida defensive line coach Chris Rumph said. \"Don't give him a clean pocket and try to change his launch point.\" \nThe Gators' front four returned just two players with a college start during the regular season – senior tackle Jon Bullard and redshirt junior end Bryan Cox Jr. With 9.5 tackles for loss, including 4.5 sacks, Bullard leads the way, but the unit collectively has exceeded expectations. \nBut Rumph's defensive front is not the only surprise. \nLinebacker depth was a major concern. Yet even with starter Alex Anzalone out due to a shoulder injury, Morrison and junior Jarrad Davis have made the position a strength. Each player returned this season from a major knee injury, but Morrison, with a team-high 40 tackles, and Davis, with 38, are taking turns blowing up ball carriers. \nTwo-time All-SEC cornerback Vernon Hargreaves III is the headliner of one of the nation's top secondaries. But the football analytics website, ProFootballFocus.com, ranks fellow corners Jalen Tabor and Quincy Wilson ahead of Hargreaves after five games. \nSaftey Marcus Maye is ranked second nationally at his position. \nMorrison, though, said works remains. Florida missed upwards of 30 tackles during a 28-27 come-back win against Tennessee. \nHow the Gators' responded the next game against Ole Miss had to make offenses nervous. \n\"It was about as bad as we could play against Tennessee,\" Morrison said. \"We forgot the fundamentals, wrap up, bring you feet. It was a big emphasis, and you saw the results.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:41:57.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
