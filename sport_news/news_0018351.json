(Harry How / Getty Images) Gary Klein Contact Reporter \nUSC plays No. 14 Notre Dame in the 87th meeting between the rivals. For the Trojans, it will be the first time they play since Steve Sarkisian was fired as head coach. Times staff writer Gary Klein examines the matchups and story lines: \nRevolving door \nUSC's Clay Helton will be the fourth USC coach in four seasons to match wits with Notre Dame Coach Brian Kelly, who has come up in speculation about who might become the Trojans' permanent head coach. \nAsked to respond to a published report that listed him among potential candidates, Kelly told reporters, \"How about what we do here is we avoid the noise, and that would be considered a lot of noise.\" \nKelly said he informed his team the Trojans would have an interim coach but did not go into many details. \n\"Teams come together under those circumstances and they're going to play their very best,\" he said. \"And I just reminded them of that.\" \nIn 2012, Lane Kiffin was USC's coach in the Trojans 22-13 loss at the Coliseum. \nInterim coach Ed Orgeron brought the Trojans to South Bend in 2013 and lost, 14-10. \nLast season, Sarkisian guided the Trojans to a 49-14 victory over the Fighting Irish at the Coliseum. \nArms race \nUSC quarterback Cody Kessler is coming off a shaky performance in the Trojans' 17-12 upset loss against Washington. \nKessler had two passes intercepted and passed for only 156 yards, with no touchdowns. He was sacked five times, in part because center Max Tuerk left the game because of a season-ending knee injury. \nSophomore Toa Lobendahn replaced Tuerk and will start against Notre Dame. \nKessler has passed for 15 touchdowns, with three interceptions. \nNotre Dame quarterback DeShone Kizer became the starter after Malik Zaire suffered a season-ending ankle injury in the second game, against Virginia. \nKizer, 6 feet 4 1/2 inches and 230 pounds, has completed 66% of his passes, eight for touchdowns, with four interceptions. He also has rushed for three touchdowns. \nRun around \nUSC's Tre Madden rushed for 120 yards in 17 carries against Washington, but he has been nursing injuries. \nThis could be the game that freshman Ronald Jones II gets his heaviest workload. Jones has averaged 8.1 yards per carry and has play-breaking capability. Junior Justin Davis, who had rushed for two touchdowns, suffered a broken ankle two years ago against Notre Dame. \nTarean Folston, Notre Dame's top returning running back, suffered a season-ending knee injury against Texas in the opener. \nC.J. Prosise is averaging 129.8 yards rushing per game. He has run for nine touchdowns and also caught a touchdown pass. Last week against Navy, he rushed for 129 yards and three touchdowns. \nDepleted receivers \nJuJu Smith-Schuster has 33 receptions and six touchdowns for a USC receiver corps depleted by injuries. \nSteven Mitchell Jr., who has four touchdowns, probably won't play because of an ankle injury suffered against Washington. Isaac Whitney, who has two touchdowns, has a broken collarbone. \nDarreus Rogers could return from a hamstring injury that sidelined him for most of the last two games. \nCornerback Adoree' Jackson is expected to get more opportunities at receiver. \nNotre Dame's Will Fuller is regarded as one of college football's top receivers. \nThe junior from Philadelphia has 29 receptions, seven for touchdowns, and is averaging 19.5 yards per catch. \nFamiliar face \nAmir Carlisle, who began his career at USC before transferring to Notre Dame after the 2011 season, has caught 16 passes. \nHe also is averaging 19.5 yards per kickoff return. \nGetting defensive \nUSC's defense, under fire after a loss to Stanford, has played well the last two games. \nThe Trojans gave up 14 points against Arizona State, 17 against Washington. \nLinebacker Su'a Cravens leads the Trojans with four tackles for losses. Cornerback Iman Marshall, who intercepted a pass against Washington, appears recovered from an abdominal injury that prevented him from finishing the game. \nNotre Dame linebacker Jaylon Smith has a team-best 42 tackles, 5 1/2 for losses. Linebacker Joe Schmidt, who played at Santa Ana Mater Dei High, has three tackles for losses. Cornerback Cole Luke has two interceptions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:54:41.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
