By Jay Pennell Oct 25, 2015 at 8:26p ET Talladega, Ala. 0Shares \nDale Earnhardt Jr . did just about everything he needed to do to advance to the Eliminator Round of the Chase on Sunday at Talladega Superspeedway, but he ultimately came up short, finishing second to Joey Logano and ending the day 11th in the championship standings. \nEarnhardt led a race-high 61 laps, fought back from adversity multiple times and was in a position to challenge Logano for the win, but never had the chance. Lining up second for the final two restarts of the day, Earnhardt was unable to make up any ground as caution flags flew quickly behind him and ultimately ended the race before a move could be made. \nWith the results initially uncertain while NASCAR reviewed tape of the finish, fans showered the track with boos after it was announced Logano was the winner. Earnhardt was not upset with NASCAR's ultimate decision, however. \n\"Another 100 yards I would have been in the lead, but NASCAR makes the calls,\" Earnhardt said. \"They are the governing body, and I have 100 percent faith in the choices that they make. I'm not going to be too upset about it. I did everything I could. I'm proud of myself. I'm proud of my team. \n\"We can sit here and pout about this day, but we didn't do good enough in the first two races of this round,\" he said. \"If we had done better in those first two races of this round, we would not be worried about losing by a splitter. We didn't do a good job in those first two races. We've got to try to win another race before the year is out, have some fun.\" \nOne of the favorites going into the day and in need of a win to advance in the Chase, Earnhardt admitted he was anxious about Talladega. \n\"I'm glad this weekend's over with,\" he said. \"I felt like crap all weekend. Just been real nervous, feeling sick to my stomach. I just wanted to go out there, whatever happened, put forth a good account of myself, my team. I'm real proud of what we did today. So I can feel good about that.\" Four drivers eliminated from Sprint Cup title contention at Talladega \nWhile he was fast throughout the entire event, Earnhardt's day was not without issues and nervous moments. \nEach time NASCAR's most popular driver brought the No. 88 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet to pit road under green-flag conditions, he smoked the tires getting slowed down. \nOn Lap 120, he was hit with a pass-through penalty after his pit crew went over the wall too soon during the green-flag pit stop. Serving the penalty on Lap 123, Earnhardt fell out of the lead draft and fell in danger of going a lap down. \nDespite the penalty, the third-generation driver remained calm inside the car and tried to rally his over-the-wall guys. \n\"Don't panic. Don't panic,\" he said over the radio. \"Shake it off. You've been good all day.\" \nWhen the caution flew on Lap 133 for Justin Allgaier's blown motor, Earnhardt was the last car on the lead lap and the field was bearing down on the No. 88 Chevrolet. \nUsing his renowned plate-racing skills, Earnhardt quickly worked his way through the pack, making his way back to the lead in just 11 laps.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:54:25.532+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
