A few teams earned district titles last week, but there’s still a lot yet to be decided. We have a new team in the No. 2 spot this week. And as always remember this is a state of current teams, not necessarily a head-to-head match-up debate. \n1. Wakulla (6-1) – Last week : 1; beat Rickards, 20-13; This week : vs. NFC (5-2) \nThe War Eagles rose to the challenge when it counted, shutting Rickards out in the second half and putting together two scores to win, including a cluth third-and-long conversion that went for a touchdown. Wakulla’s goals have been reached until the playoffs, so it’ll be interesting the focus it has this week against a team it beat by 17 last year. \n2. Blountstown (7-1) – Last week : 4; beat Freeport, 42-0; This week : at Port St. Joe (5-1) \nThe Tigers rolled to their seventh consecutive victory and now face last year’s 1A state champion for a district title. Contrary to all season, Blountstown passed its way to victory last week, meaning both elements are sharp going into its toughest game all season. \n3. Rickards (5-2) – Last week : 2; lost to Wakulla, 20-13; bye; This week : bye \nThe Raiders came out focused and had Wakulla on the ropes but couldn’t closed. That means Rickards will be using its bye week to prepare for Godby, knowing a win is the playoffs and a loss is an unfortunate end to a quality season. \n4. Chiles (5-2) – Last week : 3; lost to Alachua Santa Fe, 42-10; This week : vs. Rutherford (2-6) \nThe Timberwolves got up 10 points quick and fell apart just as quickly. In some ways it was expected, facing a wing-T offense it never sees, on the road, after two last-second wins in previous weeks. Let’s see if Chiles uses the L to refocus for the stretch run and an upcoming game against Leon to win a district title. \n5. Florida High (5-3) – Last week : 5; lost to Mosley, 44-28; This week : vs. Marianna (3-4) \nThe Seminoles dropped a non-district game and now face another before the ultimate test in their finale, a game against Taylor County that it must win just to create a three-way tiebreaker in the district.

NFC (5-2) – Last week : 6; beat Maclay, 53-3; This week : at Wakulla (6-1) \nThe Eagles are in the driver’s seat and should have no trouble getting a district title. Weeks like this one are about preparing for the playoffs and playing the kind of opponents needed to reach NFC’s biggest goal, a state title. \n7. Godby (2-4) – Last week : 7; bye; This week : vs. Ocala Trinity Catholic (2-6) \nThis is an important week for the Cougars coming off a bye. Their goals are still reachable in holding onto a city title and making the playoffs, but you’d like momentum and continuity on offense heading into a must-win vs. Rickards. \n8. Madison County (5-3) – Last week : 8; beat Lafayette, 53-6; This week : at Taylor County (3-4) \nThe Cowboys recovered from an 0-3 start and have now secured a district title. Their opponent this week is their biggest rival and a team they’ve owned historically, but this reads like a trap game on the road. \n9. Jefferson County (5-2) – Last week : 9; beat Hamilton County, 20-14; This week : at East Gadsden (0-7) \nA giant district win in overtime has the Tigers in the playoffs after a four-year absence. But that makes this week’s non-district game an easy one to overlook by counting out a winless opponent. \n10. John Paul II (4-3) – Last week : 10; lost to St. Joseph, 10-7; This week : vs. Munroe (0-7) \nThe Panthers held close on the road against an undefeated team that they could very well see again for the conference championship. John Paul II has a likely win this week before facing a good team in Oak Hall to close the regular season. \nOutside looking in : Liberty County (4-3), Taylor County (3-4), Lincoln (2-5), Leon (2-5), Franklin County (2-5), West Gadsden (2-5), Maclay (1-5), Aucilla Christian (1-5), East Gadsden (0-7), FAMU DRS (0-6), Munroe (0-7) \nRickards receiver Marcus Riley tries to shake loose a Madison County defender after a completed pass.

Shoutouts to Scott Oliver , Jack Turner and Jermaine Miller for getting oh-so-close. No one else came in better than my 9-3 record. \nDue to being made prior to the season starting, when some bye weeks were still getting filled in, only 10 of 14 games are the pick ‘em sheet for this week.
