He had a second-place finish in Dubai over this past winter before a meddling fifth-place finish in the Dubai Sheema Classic. He was fourth in a Group 1 race at Epsom in June but his form this summer has been mediocre, with only a third-place finish in a minor stake at Chester being his best result.\n“We’re pretty happy where he is at the moment,” Ian Russell, Simcock’s assistant who is handling Sheikhzayedroad’s affairs while at Woodbine, said.\n“He doesn’t have as much form as he possibly should have but we want to think he’s in the same shape he was when he won the Northern Dancer.”\nTo get him going, they tried everything including entering him in longer races. But after failing in a two-mile race and one slightly longer than a mile and a half, the plan now is to run him at a distance he is most experienced.\n“We played with different distances,” Russell said. “We decided to bring him back to the starting point of a mile and a half.”\nMartin Lane will get the ride on Sunday.\nBIRD WATCHING\nWe met him as a two-year-old winning the Coronation Futurity, Canada’s biggest race for two-year-olds.\nWe watched in 2013 as he won the Breeders’ Stakes then capture Canada’s horse of the year after taking the Jamaica Handicap at Belmont.\nNow that he spends most of his time competing in good turf events stateside, we get another look at Up With The Birds as he looks to become the sixth different Canadian-bred to win the International.\n“I’ve been very happy with him,” trainer Graham Motion told Woodbine Entertainment.\n“He’s doing well. I thought his Arlington Million going a mile and a quarter was very good.”\nHowever that fourth-place finish behind Chicago favourite The Pizza Man may have been his best U.S. outing.\nThis season, he has thirds in the Dixie at Pimlico and in the Arlington Handicap and another fourth in his last start, the Commonwealth Cup at Laurel.\nLast year, he won his only local start, the Nijinsky Stakes.\nBut he ended his season with a trip to the Japan Cup, a race he was by no means competitive in.\nJohn Velazquez comes north for the mount.\nTRYING AGAIN\nThe first attempt at open company by Danish Dynaformer was not that good.\nHe found himself on the lead early in the Northern Dancer Turf and was a non-factor in the stretch, finishing sixth.\nThe three-year-old son of Dynaformer will try again in the International as the lone three-year-old in the field, hoping the pace will be more suitable. But the forecast calls for some precipitation meaning the ground will not be as hard as he likes.\nStill, there is plenty trainer Roger Attfield likes about the colt that nearly won this year’s Queen’s Plate and impressed all of us with his sensational win in the Breeders’ Stakes.\n“He’s got a big turn of foot and a huge cruising speed,” Attfield said. “This is going to be his toughest race so far.”\n“He’s doing well heading into it. He’s done well on this course in the past.”\nWith regular rider Patrick Husbands taking the call on Kaigun, Eurico Rosa da Silva gets the mount.\nSATURDAY NOTES\nSouthern Ring, who dominated in her second lifetime start, should be favoured in the $100,000 Ruling Angel Stakes at Woodbine. Da Silva gets the call … Breeders’ Crown elimination action continues at Woodbine on Saturday night with three-year-olds and older horses looking for spots in the finals.\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nSheikzayedroad travels back to Woodbine\nBy Richard Mauntah , Toronto Sun First posted: Friday, October 16, 2015 11:23 PM EDT | Updated: Friday, October 16, 2015 11:28 PM EDT\nAt Thursday’s post-position draw for Sunday’s Canadian International, a lot was made of a horse named for a major thoroughfare in the United Arab Emirates.\nWhen naming the horse, breeder Rabbah Bloodstock could have given him the road’s boring official designation, E 11.\nBut fortunately for us, though not so fortunately for race callers, he goes by the street’s more attractive name, Sheikhzayedroad.\nThe six-year-old English-bred son of Dubawi may not be as fancied as the other two runners coming from England for the $1-million turf classic but he does have something they don’t, a win at Woodbine.\nLast year, trainer David Simcock tested the waters with him in the Northern Dancer Turf, where he came from last to win by a half-length.\nIt was believed then that he would return to contest last year’s International but was instead entered in the Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot, where he would be a non-threatening sixth.\nAbout the author Richard Mauntah Other Stories Habibi takes International path to race\nThe Canadian International will again live up to its name on Sunday, with horses from Britain, Ireland, the U.S., Canada, and even a transplanted Kiwi ready to do battle at Woodbine.\n0\nCanadian International could attract a dozen\nThe renewal of the Canadian International on Sunday is turning out to be an excellent betting race.\n0\nSee more from Richard Mauntah »\nTop stories Popular Latest Videos Chat: Jays vs. Royals, Game 1\n0\nCoach is in Bautista's corner\n0\nSubstance over scandal in Canada's social media election\n0\n'No. 1 Jays fan' gets Bautista bat flip tattoo\n0\nTory vows to repair T.O.'s reputation during trip to England\n0\nMaple Leafs earn first win under coach Mike Babcock\n0\nTrudeau’s plan 'unicorns and rainbows': Harper\n0\nEdmonton police say pizza place was delivering liquor, beer in pie boxes\n0\nPolice: Mom, teen daughter and daughter's boyfriend carry out love triangle slaying\n0\nLamar Odom regains consciousness, family and friends say\n0\nAndrea Christidis remembered\nJays get ready for Game 5\nGame 5 will be The Stroman Show\nNorth Korean Yeonmi Park's View of Canadian Freedoms\nPredictions for the Jays in ALDS\nMore from Horse Racing Sheikzayedroad travels back to Woodbine 0\nHabibi takes International path to race 0\nCanadian International could attract a dozen 0\nSix-pack of potential for trainer Casse 0\nGamble’s Ghost cruises to Mazarine Stakes win 0\nInside Toronto sun.com Sports\nLeafs earn first win under Babcock 0", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-17T11:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:15:23.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
