After their Oct. 8 win over Mount Si, the Wolves got some rest: They’ll play Lake Washington in a nonconference outing at 3:45 p.m. Oct. 15, and will open the KingCo championships Oct. 19 at neighboring Skyline. \nEastlake’s top two singles players led the charge against Mount Si with a pair of 6-0, 6-0 wins. Thiago Bandeira thumped John Day in the No. 1 match, and Townsend Rowland defeated Dhruv Khurand in the No. 2 match.

Bandeira dominated, winning 6-0, 6-0. \nNo. 3 single Jerry Shen was a 6-0, 6-1 winner over Jacob Holmes, and No. 4 single Lucas Minet downed Ryan Cantalini (6-1, 6-3). \nThe Wolves won all three doubles matches, including victories for Sahil Agarwal and Nick Zhao (6-4, 7-5); Anand Nambakam and Colin James (6-0, 6-0); and Liam Bigbee and Tyler Lam. \nThe big question surrounding the team before the KingCo tournament is a familiar one: Will Bandeira move to the doubles bracket in order to enhance his chances of a state-tournament berth? \nBandeira was in the same quandary last season and opted to pair with Aashray Anand in the postseason. The move turned out well as Bandeira and Anand won the KingCo doubles title, then were runners-up at May’s state tournament. \nBandeira said his singles game is as good as it has ever been. But he also enjoys playing doubles and could have a solid partner in fellow senior Jeff Gross, who is expected to recover from a minor injury in time for the KingCo tourney. \n“Jeff was with us for the good first half of matches and then he tweaked a little something in his knee, so he’s been out for a few weeks,” Bandeira said. “He probably could’ve played. We just don’t want to risk it because KingCo is really what matters a lot to us.” \nBandeira’s decision could hinge on the difficulty of the singles bracket, which might not be as tough as 2014. A few area stars – including Issaquah’s Jackson Suh and Redmond’s Adam Guo – elected not to play high-school tennis. With Eastlake sophomore Clemente Varas also sitting out so he can hone his game for the college level, Bandeira is now unquestionably the Wolves’ best player. \nBandeira has been training in the offseason for several years at Robinswood Tennis Center in Bellevue, where he often matches up against players from powerhouse programs like Newport and Mercer Island. \n“Just recently, I’ve been working there, too, with little kids, sort of teaching them tennis, giving them that little spark,” Bandeira added. \nLike the Eastlake team, Bandeira finished 6-2 against KingCo 4A foes, losing only to Skyline and Newport. \n“They’ve just got a lot of depth – I mean, you go down to their third doubles and those kids are playing year-round,” he said. “Their whole team is just really, really involved with tennis year-round, so they’re just strong year after year after year.” \nWritten by Neil Pierson · Filed Under Eastlake High School , Sports \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:58:25.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
