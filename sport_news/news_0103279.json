Bowe Bergdahl face a lower-level court-martial and be spared the possibility of jail time for leaving his post in Afghanistan, his lawyer said Saturday.\nDefense attorney Eugene Fidell said Lt. Col. Mark Visger has decided Bergdahl's case should go to a military system similar to civilian courts that handle misdemeanor charges. It limits the maximum punishment to reduction of rank, a bad-conduct discharge and a short jail term, although that isn't being sought, Fidell said.\nMilitary prosecutors charged Bergdahl in March with desertion and misbehavior before the enemy, a charge that could carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.\nBergdahl was captured by the Taliban after leaving his post on June 30, 2009, and held until last year, when he was exchanged for five Taliban commanders. His commanding officers in Afghanistan say a 45-day search for Bergdahl put soldiers in danger.\nThe Obama administration's prisoner swap was sharply criticized by many Republicans and some Democrats, who said it was politically motivated and counter to the U.S. policy against negotiating with terrorists.\nRepublican presidential front-runner Donald Trump said Thursday that Bergdahl should have been executed for leaving his post in Afghanistan and called him a \"no-good traitor,\" which he also said in August.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T17:06:23.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
