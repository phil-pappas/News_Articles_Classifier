After Kyle Whittingham's club fell to the Trojans, Mandel put them at No. 8 .\n\"While I’m taking my share of mockery now for having ranked Utah No. 1 the past several weeks, the fact is the Utes had earned it to that point,\" Mandel wrote. \"Now, following their blowout loss to USC, there is no team out there with an obviously deserving of No. 1 resume.\"\nEven with the loss, Mandel says the Utes \"still deserve credit for their 6-0 start against Sagarin’s No. 6-rated schedule.\"\nElsewhere, the ESPN Pac-12 blog dishes harshly on Utah. Kevin Gemmell puts it at No. 3 in his Pac-12 power rankings behind Stanford and Washington State, while Kyle Bonagura predicts the Utes will now go to the Alamo Bowl.\n\"No one was going to make it through the Pac-12 South undefeated,\" Gemmell writes. \"And anyone who thought otherwise was embracing illusions. That said, Utah got beat in the worst way possible — they got out-muscled, something that doesn't happen often to a Kyle Whittingham team.\"\nIs Jakob Poeltl the best center in the country?\nwrote over the weekend that Poeltl could be the best center in all of college basketball.\nIn a breakdown of Utah's roster, O'Donnell writes that the key to Larry Krystkowiak and company making a deep run in the NCAA Tournament will be for Poeltl to draw enough attention that his teammates can thrive.\n\"There simply aren't going to be many opposing big men who will be able to check Poeltl one-on-one at this level,\" O'Donnell writes. \"At seven feet and 240 pounds, he's the rare college center who can dominate both ends of the floor with NBA size.\"\nHayward a key to the Western Conference playoff race\nexamined how each of the three teams' key player can help push his squad to the postseason.\nHarper identifies Utah's Gordon Hayward, Phoenix's Eric Bledsoe and Minnesota's Andrew Wiggins as key figures in the race, giving Hayward and the Jazz the edge.\n\"The fact is, the Jazz won't be in this position without Gordon Hayward — their max player — doing what max players do,\" Harper writes. \" If he and the Jazz live up to expectations in 2016, not only will we pretend we never questioned Hayward's max status, but we'll start lumping him in the group of max players that are deemed of that exclusive, higher-earning designation based on ability rather than that singular economic moment in negotiations.\"\nRyan McDonald is a sports reporter at DeseretNews.com .
