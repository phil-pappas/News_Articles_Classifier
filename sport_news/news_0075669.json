His teammates followed, embracing him in a giant hug as they jumped up and down in excitement.\nThe 25-year-old had just scored the go-ahead goal in Los Angeles off a penalty kick to give the Timbers a 2-1 lead over the reigning MLS Cup Champion LA Galaxy . This, a scant three minutes after Adi had recorded the equalizer, turning and firing a beautiful left-footed shot into the net.\nOn the field, he exuded confidence.\n\"Adi has never been more bought in,\" Timbers coach Caleb Porter said. \"He loves it here. He wants to win. Guys love him. He's playing hard. He's playing big.\"\nAdi has been the main offensive weapon in an otherwise lackluster Timbers attack this season . He leads Portland with an MLS club record 15 goals and has recorded five goals in the last four games to help the Timbers (14-11-8, 50 points) earn three critical wins. With Adi leading the way, Portland has jumped back above the red line into fourth place in the Western Conference standings with one game left in the regular season.\nAnd Adi couldn't be happier.\nAfter spending six years bouncing around different clubs in Europe looking for the right fit, Adi feels like he belongs in Portland.\n\"All along, I've been trying to find a perfect fit and I think here is a great fit for me,\" Adi said. \"I'm pleased to be in Portland.\"\n• • •\nAdi grew up playing soccer, barefoot, in a remote village in Benue State, which sits in the middle of Nigeria.\nWhen his parents sent him on errands, the budding soccer star would often get sidetracked and instead end up playing soccer in the streets. He would spend hours running up and down the sandy lots alongside other children, completely forgetting about the errands, even though he knew he'd be in trouble when he came home.\nAdi still remembers his first pair of \"cleats.\" The shoes were a gift from a friend and Adi was so excited to have real boots that he didn't even realize that they were American football cleats. The first time he went in for a tackle, he accidentally cut his opponent's leg with the spikes.\n\"They looked like soccer shoes,'\" Adi said. \"I was excited because basically before that I played without shoes.\"\nFanendo Adi's journey to the Portland Timbers Adi talks about learning to play soccer as a barefoot boy in Nigeria and about the journey from there through other countries to Portland, where he's the Timbers' leading scorer.\nDespite his humble beginnings, Adi quickly rose up the ranks. An agent noticed him playing when he was 15 and invited him to come to a tryout in Lagos, Nigeria's teeming metropolis.\nAdi's parents weren't pleased. They wanted their son to focus on his education and earn a college degree. But Adi couldn't pass up the chance to chase his dream.\n\"My family didn't want me to travel anywhere to go play football,\" Adi said. \"They wanted me to go to school. At the end of the day, I had to lie to my family to go play football.\"\nAdi arrived at the tryout expecting to be one of 65 players competing for 10 spots in the Brazilian Soccer School, a well-regarded soccer academy in Lagos. Instead, 400 boys showed up to the tryout.\nThe lean and tall striker had just 10 minutes to show off his skills, but it was enough.\n\"Out of 400 players, he ended up choosing just me,\" Adi said. \"I was the one that came from a very small village and became the chosen one out of 400.\"\nAdi spent the next six months honing his game at the Brazilian Soccer School, before being sent to a tryout for second-division club AS Trenčín in Slovakia. The tryout lasted just 30 minutes, but once again Adi made an impression.\nHe was offered the chance to leave Nigeria to play professional soccer.\n\"I was pretty lucky because the owner of the club was basically there to see my tryout,\" Adi said. \"It was just 30 minutes and they decided to give me a contract.\"\n• • •\nIn 2014, Adi was offered the chance to join Danish Superliga side FC Copenhagen. He traveled to Denmark excited to continue to build his career in Europe, but the coach that brought Adi to Copenhagen was fired only days after he arrived.\nA new coach came in with his own crop of players and style of play and Adi realized that he might need to look for another opportunity.\nWhen he was offered the chance to come to America and join the Timbers on loan, he jumped at it.\n\"It became complicated, knowing that the coach that brought you to the team has been fired,\" Adi said. \"Coming to America was a decision that was very easy, knowing that the club wanted me and the coach wanted me.\"\nIn his first five games in Portland, Adi recorded two braces, prompting the Timbers to sign him as a designated player .\nBut Adi's transition to MLS wasn't seamless. The striker went through long scoreless droughts in 2014 and early 2015, causing Porter to replace Adi in the lineup in select games with Timbers forward Maximiliano Urruti .\nStill, over time, Adi has shown just how valuable he can be for the Timbers.\n\"He's been great,\" Timbers defender Jorge Villafana said. \"He's been doing a great job on top holding the ball and scoring goals.\"\nAdi is still young and Porter said he is continuing to evolve as a player. This year, Porter has tried to help Adi simplify his game and worked on finding ways to play to his strengths. He sends Adi a text before every game, reminding the 6 foot 4 striker to \"play big.\"\n\"He's a guy that as big as he is, sometimes he doesn't play that big or in the past he hasn't,\" Porter said. \"But he's learning to embrace how big and strong and mean he can be.\"\nWith the Timbers on the cusp of earning a playoff berth, Adi has never felt more motivated to succeed.\nHe has grown into his shoes and is living out his dream.\n\"In soccer, nothing is easy,\" Adi said. \"Of course, we've had our ups and downs, but I came here to play and that's just what I'm doing.\"\n-- Jamie Goldberg | jgoldberg@oregonian.com\n503-853-3761 | @ jamiebgoldberg", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Jamiebgoldberg"], "published": "2015-10-22T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:23:17.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
