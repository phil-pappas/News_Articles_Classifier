His late father, Jack, who coached at Hartley and St. Charles, is the only member of three Ohio coaches halls of fame (baseball, football, basketball).\n“Dad never won a state championship, though,” Ryan said. “This is a dream come true. He’d be so proud today.”\nTrailing by four shots entering the day, Bexley used a strong overall effort to overtake Canton Central Catholic.\n“Except for No. 18, when we gave up eight shots in the opening round, we played some outstanding golf, and we had a feeling when we got off the bus we had a great chance,” Ryan said. “The kids were really loose and confident. After we won the district, we were determined to win the state. In the kids’ minds, nothing was going to stop us.”\nConnor Quigley of Dayton Oakwood shot a final-round 67 to share the title with Karmia, the first-round leader. Karmia had two birdies, the most notable coming on the par-5 No. 7 when he hooked a shot into the water, took a penalty stroke and chipped in from 40 yards.\n“There are no words to describe how I feel right now,” Karmia said. “I liked our team’s chances of contending, but if you told me at the beginning of the season that I would be state medalist, I’d say you were crazy. This was not one of my favorite courses and still isn’t for that matter. But I was able to pull out two great rounds in not such great conditions. I’ll take it.”\nHunter Roberts (eighth, 156); Josh Meyer (13th, 159); Trevor Binau (16th, 161) and Davis Williams (23rd, 164) rounded out the scoring for the Lions.\nHartley’s Chris Williard finished in a fifth-place tie at 154.\nAt the Ohio State Scarlet Course, Fisher Catholic scrambled for an eight-stroke margin of victory over Columbiana for the Division III championship.\nAlthough the Irish (323-335—658) scored significantly higher than usual because of the bitter, windy conditions and rock-hard greens, coach Travis Saffell said the team persevered.\n“Today went completely different than I envisioned, except the winning,” he said. “The weather and the pressure really took a toll. It really seemed like a war out there all day. I felt like more of a therapist than a coach, convincing the kids to just hang in there and stay composed ... that they were doing better than it seemed.”\nAaron Wood (78-77—155) tied for third and Blake Saffell (74-82—156) was fifth to pace Fisher Catholic. Both are seniors.\n“When I came in four years ago as coach, I told these guys we were changing the program and I wanted everyone to commit to becoming a state power,” Saffell said. “This is the culmination of an awful lot of hard work and a dream.”\nMark Schlabach of Berlin Hiland was medalist (151) and Brayden Baldridge of Danville was runner-up, one stroke back. Baldridge was third a year ago.\nIn the Division II girls tournament at OSU Gray, Liza Weisman of Bexley took fifth with a 79-76—1 55.\nsblackledge@dispatch.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T13:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:18:40.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
