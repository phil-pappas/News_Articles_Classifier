The sportsmen will be present on behalf of the entire Olympic team.\nThe charity event will bank on Pele's marketability, who will autograph items that will be auctioned at the event, and proceeds from which will be used for grassroots football, and will not be shared with AIFF. \"We will use the money the best way we see fit. This competition is into its 56th year and you can see the number of players who have participated in this event and then gone on to represent the national team. We want it to become even better,\" an organiser said.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-15T18:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:54:38.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
