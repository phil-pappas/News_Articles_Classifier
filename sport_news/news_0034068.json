(AP) - A mixed-use development in downtown Conway is set to bear the name of professional golfer John Daly. \nThe Log Cabin Democrat (http://bit.ly/1PmNg1y ) reports John Daly’s and The Lofts at 912 will be a combination of a steakhouse and living spaces in a condemned building. The building’s makeover will cost around $1.5 million. \nAdam Waldron, chief financial officer for developer S.A.M. Group LLC, said the ground-floor steakhouse and bar would feature Daly memorabilia. Daly lived in Dardanelle and attended the University of Arkansas. \nThe second floor of the development would have 2,500 feet of living space made up of four furnished lofts. \nThe project was announced Wednesday during the annual meeting of the Conway Downtown Partnership. Waldron says developers are aiming for an April opening. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:23:14.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
