Comment Posted Oct. 18, 2015 at 1:14 AM Updated at 1:43 AM Posted Oct. 18, 2015 at 1:14 AM Updated at 1:43 AM GLENDALE, Ariz. Patrice Bergeron scored twice in the last 11 minutes to lift the Boston Bruins to a 5-3 victory over the Arizona Coyotes on Saturday night. Tyler Randell, Dave Krejci and Brad Marchand also scored to help the Bruins win their second straight. Tuukka Rask stopped 20 shots for his first win of the season, and Krejci and Torey Krug each had two assists. Shane Doan had a goal and two assists, and Tobias Rieder and Kyle Chipchura also scored for Arizona. The Coyotes have lost two straight after opening the season with three wins. Rieder and Chipchura scored 2 1/2 minutes apart in the third quarter to tie the score with about 13 1/2 minutes to go. Bergeron then redirected a pass from Ryan Spooner into the net for the go-ahead power-play score at 9:10 of the period. Bergeron then added his third of the season with 1:06 left to seal the win. Marchand’s short-handed breakaway goal at 4:44 of the third period extended Boston’s lead to 3-1 before the Coyotes rallied to tie it. Doan gave the Coyotes a 1-0 lead with his first goal of the season at 2:12 of the first period. He forcing a rebound off the skate of Bruins defenseman Kevan Miller and under Rask’s leg pads. The goal was reviewed after Boston coach Claude Julien used his challenge but the ruling stood. The unassisted goal marked Doan’s 900th career point, making him the second player in franchise history to reach that milestone. The Bruins failed to capitalize on their first three power plays of the game, but spent much of the night peppering Coyotes goalie Mike Smith with shots. Boston outshot Arizona 10-1 at one point in the first period, but Smith was sharp in goal early, turning away several quality Bruins chances. Smith stopped shots from David Pastrnak at 16:48 of the period and Krejci during a power play, finishing with 38 saves. The Coyotes had chances to add to their lead in the first period but could not convert on their two power plays. Coyotes center Joe Vitale, involved in some physical play early in the game, was given five minutes for fighting in the second period along with Boston’s Miller. Miller had the better of the scrap with Vitale but the Bruins couldn’t convert on the resulting power play after Oliver Ekman-Larsson was given two minutes for roughing in the skirmish. Vitale went into the locker room after his time in the penalty box and did not return. The Bruins finally solved Smith at 8:42 of the second after Smith has stopped two shots by Bergeron and a wrister from Colin Miller. Randell finished a pass from Krejci with a left backhand to tie the score at 1. Page 2 of 2 - Less than a minute later, Rask stretched to stop a shot by Rieder. Krejci put Boston ahead 2-1 with a power-play goal with 4:41 to go in the second. NOTES: Marchand returned from a concussion suffered on Oct. 10 against Montreal. ...
