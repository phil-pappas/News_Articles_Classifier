His mother named him after the famous civil rights activist W.E.B. Du Bois.\nIn fact, Angela Ross gave each of her three children aspirational names. Boise’s two older brothers are named Langston Harlem Ross (after famed writer and social activist Langston Hughes) and Duke Ellington Ross (after the jazz legend).\n“What I was trying to do with all my children is let them know that with that name comes great opportunity,” Angela Ross said by phone from her home in Bethlehem, Pa. “Where we came from, you saw a lot of drug dealing. I wanted them to know that you guys are more than what you see on the street.”\n“These people you’re named after, these are the people you came from, they’re the ones you aspire to,” Angela Ross said. “My goal was to inspire them to achieve who their inner spirit was, along with a Christian background. You can be whatever you want to be. This is a name you can carry on.”\nBoise Ross is making a name for himself this season.\nThe junior cornerback already has 10 pass breakups and two interceptions in four games. Those 12 passes defended are the most of any player in the nation.\nRoss will lead the UB defense against high-flying Bowling Green at 3:30 p.m. Saturday at UB Stadium. Bowling Green boasts the No. 1-ranked pass offense in the nation, averaging 442 yards a game.\nRoss takes his name to heart.\n“William Edward Burghardt,” he says with a smile, “I’ve heard all about him since I was little.”\n“My name tells me it’s very important to remember and have respect for people have paved the way for us in black America,” Ross said. “It’s good my mom gave me this name because she’s so for that.”\nRoss delved deeper into Du Bois’ story last semester when he took an African-American studies class. For the first time, he read Du Bois’ famed collection of essays, “The Souls of Black Folk,” published in 1903.\n“I know my mom wants me to carry that name with confidence,” he said.\nRoss’ mom raised her three boys in the same household with her sister and her sister’s two children. Angela Ross works for a medical emergency services company.\n“My sister and I were single parents,” Angela Ross said. “We decided to raise our kids together. It was more affordable for both of us. We raised all five kids in the same household and it worked out. The family unit is very strong.”\nBoise Ross was tutored from a young age in football by brother Langston, who played football for and graduated from Moravian College, and by cousin Myron Cummings.\n“When he was a young kid, we were on the little league field and he ran and made his first score,” Angela Ross said. “I yelled, ‘Go, Boise Ross.’ It just spiraled out of control and from that point on. The coaches and everybody started calling him Boise.”\nRoss’ career at UB has taken off since he switched from receiver to cornerback for the third game of last season. It was a move of desperation. UB was thin at cornerback.\nBut Ross’ ball skills and feel for the receiver position have been an advantage for him on defense. He returned an interception at Florida Atlantic 39 yards for a touchdown.\nWith eight games to go, he needs only five more pass breakups to set the UB single-season record.\n“He’s always energetic,” said UB coach Lance Leipold. “He really has given us a boost with his playmaking, and his energy is something we want to be contagious within the program.”\nRoss has been particularly good at defending deep balls, one of the tougher challenges for players new to the position. He has shown a fine sense for when to look back for the ball. Against Nevada last week, he closed fast and knocked the ball away from the Wolf Pack’s best receiver to break up what would have been a perfectly thrown, 50-yard completion.\n“It’s more about when you know he’s out of the zone,” Ross said. “It’s around the 18- or 22-yard line. Once they get past that, they’re not running an 18-yard comeback or a 22-yard comeback. As soon as I see that, it’s a judgment thing. Then it’s time to look because the deep ball is coming. Having played the wide receiver position, I think it helps give me a feel for when to look up.”\nBowling Green likes to throw deep. Ross will get a lot of chances to play the ball. “The more work, the better,” he says.\nemail: mgaughan@buffnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:36:13.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
