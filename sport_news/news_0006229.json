We like to smile about it. A great guy, always asks us how we're doing, talking to us in the hallways. He's always been a class act.\"\nIt's not just guy football talk, either. It's in Fournette's DNA to be encouraging and upbeat. Other players say his positive attitude is infectious and provides a vital, necessary ingredient in team-building.\nLeonard Fournette always give his O-line 'shine,' RT Vadal Alexander says LSU offensive tackle Vadal Alexander talks to the media about Leonard Fournette's off-field attributes.\n\"He's always happy,\" defensive end Lewis Neal said. \"He's never stuck up or in a hole and not happy. Every time I see him he's smiling, and that's a big lift to the team. He's serious about what he's doing. That makes me like him a lot.\"\nIt's apparent Fournette is carrying the team offensively with 631 yards rushing in three games. That is the best three-game start by any LSU running back and has him leading the nation with a 210.3 yards-per-game average. Fournette's eight touchdowns make him the SEC's leading scorer despite having played one fewer game than every other player.\nBut his on-field accomplishments serve as a metaphor for what is going on inside the team dynamic, and it's remarkable considering he's been a part of the team for a little more than a year. Few sophomores can bring such panache and swagger without rubbing older players the wrong way.\nLast year, veteran players called him \"Five-star Fournette\" to initiate him into the world of college football. Now, senior offensive tackle Vadal Alexander is completely down with Fournette as a leader.\n\"Extremely humble; for a guy with so much spotlight on him, he's an extremely humble guy,\" Alexander said. \"He's a great leader to be so young, a sophomore. Everything you want a great player like that to be off the field, that's what he is.\nAlexander said he especially loves the fact that Fournette never fails to mention his offensive line and other teammates at nearly every opportunity. On Fournette's 61-yard TD run against Syracuse, he wasn't touched. That's something the line takes pride in and something Fournette notices, he said.\n\"That's our favorite play, getting the running back untouched to the end zone,\" Alexander laughed. \"You know we love that (Fournette's praise). He gives us a little bit of shine. It's appreciated.\"\nJunior center Ethan Pocic also marvels at Fournette. He came from Illinois a year before and heard the hype throughout Fournette's high school senior season.\n\"It's all true,\" he said. \"Y'all know that.\n\"He's a guy we all count on. He makes all the right choices on and off the field. He really sets a good example.\"\nAlexander said opponents must be amazed at how fast Fournette moves his large frame as he sprints past defenders who appear to have good angles.\nLeonard Fournette 'always been humble man,' LSU guards Will Clapp says LSU guard WIll Clapp talks to the media about Leonard Fournette.\n\"I don't think many people realize how fast he is,\" Alexander said. \"He's about 225 but he runs like a 4.4. you look at him and think he's not as fast as most smaller guys but he is.\"\nClapp knew coming in there was plenty of truth to the legend since he watched Fournette destroy Brother Martin for four years in their Catholic League encounters against St. Augustine. He said in one game, Fournette had \"six carries for about 200 yards in the first half\" and the Crusaders trailed, 35-0.\nMeeting him – they arrived at LSU in the same recruiting class – as a person, Clapp found him just as impressive.\n\"I'm not shocked at anything he's been doing in college,\" Clapp said. \"He's been doing great things since high school. Ever since I met him in high school he's always been a humble man.\"\nOn the practice field Fournette got everyone's attention, especially that of LSU's defense. Safety Jamal Adams emphasized that every defender \"has to have a plan\" when trying to tackle him, but that Fournette doesn't take anything for granted. And the word \"Heisman\" is a dirty one in the LSU locker room, never spoken.\n\"He comes in every day and works hard,\" Adams said. \"The Heisman is going to take care of itself. He's staying focused and keeping his head down. He's a great leader for the team.\"\nIf Fournette stays on pace -- on the field and in the locker room -- it could be a return to elite status for LSU, which is four years removed from the last championship game appearance. LSU coach Les Miles will try to manage his use as the season gets into its second month, and with a killer November schedule that includes trips to Alabama and Ole Miss and home games against Arkansas and Texas A&M.\nHaving Fournette makes anything possible for LSU in 2015.\n\"No doubt, he's probably the best player I've ever been around,\" Alexander said. \"If it's one on one he wins it 100 percent of the time. I haven't seen him not win a one-on-one battle, practice or games.\n\"(Heisman) has not been spoken about in the locker room. He's worried about the win.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T16:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:05:40.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
