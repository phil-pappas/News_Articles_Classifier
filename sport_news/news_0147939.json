By CONNOR RILEY ATHENS — Sony Michel and Nick Chubb are equals.\nChubb has proven to be one of the best running backs and Michel is building a case as one of the most versatile threats in the country.\nThe two sophomores are equal when it comes to touchdowns, though, with seven each on the season.\nThat’s good for fourth in the Southeastern Conference, one touchdown behind Leonard Fournette, Derrick Henry and Jalen Hurd, who lead the conference with eight touchdowns apiece.\nNeither Michel and Chubb claim to be angling for lead back status. Michel said he was unaware he had as many touchdowns until Chubb informed him of the stats following last weekend’s win against Southern.\nChubb said he’s happy Michel is able to find the end zone. Michel’s success helps take some of the burden and attention off Chubb.\n“There was a lot of pressure on me with everything focused on me,” Chubb said. “He’s able to come in and take a lot of pressure off of me. He’s helped me get better every day.”\nWhile Michel may make Chubb’s Saturdays easier, practice is where Chubb returns the favor of helping Michel. Like any player, Michel admits he struggles to maintain a constant effort level. But with Chubb’s notorious work ethic always on display, Michel feels the urge to match him.\n“If Nick goes out there and breaks a long run, I know that I have to got out and break a long run,” Michel said. “He helps me keep a competitive edge.”\nChubb and Michel both actively root for each other to do well, something that isn’t always the case. Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant famously could not coexist as basketball superstars who needed the ball to succeed.\nAnd head coach Mark Richt acknowledged that sometimes having two talented players at the same position can be bad for a team.\nBut everything between Michel and Chubb has been beneficial.\n“They do a great job of competing with each other and making the team better,” senior receiver Malcolm Mitchell said.\nRicht said he’s proud of how Chubb and Michel act toward each other.\n“I guarantee you every time Nick does something good, Sony is excited for him, truly excited for him. And I think when Sony does things well, I think Nick’s happy for him,” Richt said. “I think that runs through the whole team.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-01T15:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:22:11.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
