Everyone 6 months and older should get a flu vaccination unless they have a medical condition or allergy that precludes them from doing so. File photo / Union Democrat. It’s flu shot time, and Tuolumne County Public Health Officer Dr. Liza Ortiz urges everyone to get one. Everyone 6 months and older should get a flu shot unless they have a medical condition or allergy that precludes them from doing so. The benefit of getting a flu shot is that it reduces the risk of a person getting the flu and spreading it to other people. If someone gets a flu shot and still gets the flu, it will be milder, won’t require hospitalization and decreases the number of days missed at work, Ortiz said. “The flu can kill you,” Ortiz said. “There are thousands of hospitalizations and deaths every season.” Most flu-related hospitalizations are due to severe respiratory problems. Some people also go to the hospital for flu-related dehydration. Flu shots will be available in Tuolumne County at the Tuolumne County Health Fair Oct. 20 and 21, and at the Public Health Department from 1 to 4 p.m. on Tuesdays beginning Oct. 27. In Calaveras County, flu shots are available at Calaveras County Public Health from 3 to 5:30 p.m. Mondays and 8 a.m. to noon Thursdays. The cost of flu shots at CCPH is $26. Medicare is accepted, and nobody is denied access because of inability to pay. The flu is contagious, and it is often contagious before a person develops symptoms, Ortiz said. People are encouraged to wash their hands with soap and water to avoid and reduce transmission. If you have a cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose in the crook of your elbow. Children with a fever should be kept home, and adults with a fever should also stay home from work to avoid spreading the flu to others. This year’s flu vaccine strains have been changed from last year, Ortiz said. Every year, the strains used in the vaccine are chosen based on what strains are circulating. Even when the vaccine doesn’t change from the previous year, it’s important to get the vaccine yearly, since people’s immune response can wane, Ortiz said. Last year, the dominant flu vaccine strain mutated after the vaccine was manufactured, so the 2014-15 vaccine was not very effective for the circulating strain. This year, the strains in the 2015-16 vaccine have been updated to match the new predominant strains, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expects it will be much more effective, Ortiz said. At the Tuolumne County Health Fair, the nasal FluMist and the injectable vaccine flu shots will be available. The nasal spray vaccine is approved for use in people ages 2 to 49, the CDC said. Only adults will be given flu shots at the fair. On Oct. 27 and after, both adults and children can get flu shots at the health department in Sonora. The flu shot is available at the department regardless of their insurance type or status, Ortiz said. Medicare can be billed at both the health fair and health department. Otherwise the vaccine is free or people can give a donation. At the 2014 Tuolumne County Health Fair, 1,567 flu vaccines were administered. Although flu season normally peaks in January and February, it can begin as early as October and continue as late as May, according to the CDC. If someone is sick or not feeling well, they should delay getting a flu shot until they are feeling better, said Kathy Amos, Tuolumne County Public Health nurse. According to the CDC, flu shots are most important for the following groups of people (listed by rank of importance): • Children 6 months through 4 years (59 months); • People 50 years and older; • People with chronic pulmonary (including asthma), cardiovascular (except hypertension), renal, hepatic, neurologic, hematologic, or metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus); • People who are immunosuppressed (including immunosuppression caused by medications or by human immunodeficiency virus); • Women who are or will be pregnant during the influenza season; • People 6 months through 18 years old and receiving long-term aspirin therapy and who therefore might be at risk for experiencing Reye’s syndrome after influenza virus infection; • People who are residents of nursing homes and other chronic-care facilities; • American Indians/Alaska Natives; • People who are morbidly obese (body-mass index is 40 or greater); • Health-care personnel; • Household contacts and caregivers of children younger than 5 and adults 50 and older, with particular emphasis on vaccinating contacts of children aged younger than 6 months; and • Household contacts and caregivers of people with medical conditions that put them at higher risk for severe complications from influenza.

Cold versus Flu The flu and the common cold are both respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. It can be difficult to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, because they can have similar symptoms. In general, the flu is worse than the common cold, and symptoms like fever, body aches, extreme tiredness and dry cough are more common and intense. Colds are usually milder than the flu. People with colds are more likely to have a runny or stuffy nose. Colds generally do not result in serious health problems, like pneumonia, bacterial infections or hospitalizations.
