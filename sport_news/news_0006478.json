Zaidi today discussed election preparedness with representatives of various political parties at AN Sinha Social Studies Institute, Patna. He will also hold review meetings with other top officials in Muzaffarpur tomorrow. The CEC will meet the chief electoral officer, state nodal officers and top officials of the police and the excise and income tax departments to review security and poll expenditure. Top guns of political parties are busy wooing voters in 50 constituencies of six districts, including Patna, Buxar and Nalanda, which are going to polls in the third phase on October 28. In a bid to create fissures in the secular alliance ahead of the third phase, the BJP has made public Nitish Kumar’s letter to the then Chief Minister Lalu Prasad 23 years ago in which he had charged Prasad with fostering corruption and giving leverage to a particular caste in government jobs. The BJP published selectively from Kumar’s letter in full-page advertisements in vernacular dailies yesterday and asked people to decide for whom to vote. In the letter written in December 1992, Kumar accused Prasad, then his comrade in-arms, of renouncing social justice agenda and making it a mere slogan for personal popularity. On the other hand, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad, who has milked to the last drop Mohan Bhagwat’s call for a review of the reservation policy, feels the BJP’s fate has been “sealed” by the RSS chief’s remarks and claims a 1995-like situation prevails in Bihar when the Janata Dal had emerged triumphant in “Mandal versus Kamandal” politics. He said there was a “pattern” behind Bhagwat’s remarks. “That is their thought process. Their psyche is against the SC/ST and OBC. What was their inner core came out. They were caught red-handed. And we galvanised the SC/ST and OBC against them, telling the weaker sections what the BJP is up to. This has sealed BJP’s fate and finished their game, as the beneficiaries of social justice have come together,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:02:49.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
