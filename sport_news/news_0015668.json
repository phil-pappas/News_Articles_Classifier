Here are Feldman's rankings after Week 7: \n1. Utah : Struggled early with a decent ASU team but then the Utes took control to notch another solid win. \n2 Baylor : Seth Russell runs for 160 yards and passes for 380 and five TDs against a respectable WVU D as the Bears blew another team out, winning 62-38. \n3. LSU : Beat previously undefeated Florida behind another big game from Leonard Fournette and some really good play from QB Brandon Harris. \n4. Clemson : How good is QB Deshaun Watson and Co.? Boston College had only allowed four TDs in its first six games and 140 total yards (best in the nation). Unbeaten Clemson scored four TDs and had over 500 yards on 'em. \n5. TCU : A close game at Iowa State turned into a 45-21 romp behind another huge week for Trevone Boykin and Josh Doctson . The Horned Frogs amassed 621 yards, marking the fifth time in seven games they've eclipsed the 600-yard mark. \n6. Ohio State: The Buckeyes blew out Penn State in the second half to stay undefeated but they did have their hands full with RB Saquon Barkley ; but a lot of folks will.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T09:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:34:38.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
