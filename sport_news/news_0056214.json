Two more big left hooks and then a barrage of blows from both sides left Jeter in all sorts of problems and he had no complaints when Foster saved him from a savage onslaught. \nIt was devastating and it was done - and Eubank Jr was in a no-nonsense mood afterwards, immediately looking forward to a December 12 showdown. \n\"I'm ready for Spike O'Sullivan,\" he told Sky Sports. \n\"He's been talking a lot of mess and it's time for some punishment. Please back up these words because I'm going to be going in there like an animal and I hope you're ready for it. \n\"Everything's been working smoothly. There's been no clash. It has been smooth in the changing room and as you guys saw, it was smooth up on there on the big stage. This is a taste of things to come.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T10:07:03.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
