Their three wins are the most in a season since 2010. \nLouisiana-Monroe (1-6, 0-3) tied it at 13 with 9:03 left in the third quarter when Craig Ford kicked his second field goal, a 31-yarder. \nIdaho responded with a nine-play, 79-yard drive capped by Watson's first touchdown less than three minutes later. \nThe Warhawks went three-and-out on their next two possessions before turning it over on downs on their final two drives. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:14:48.757+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
