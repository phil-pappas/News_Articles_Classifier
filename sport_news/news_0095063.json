(Photo by Chris Graythen/Getty Images) Iconic actor Tom Cruise was in attendance for LSU's victory over Florida in Tiger Stadium this past weekend. Sitting in AD Joe Alleva's booth, Cruise watched Leonard Fournette rush for 180 yards, and Brandon Harris toss two touchdowns in the 35-28 victory.\nWhile Cruise was enjoying some high-quality SEC football, was he also scouting talent for his next film?\nMiles: \"How about Tom Cruise being at the game? My daughter saw him. I'd be a good bad guy I think in a Jack Reacher movie.\" Priceless. #LSU\n— Scott Rabalais (@RabalaisAdv) October 19, 2015 LSU head coach Les Miles threw his hat into the ring during his Monday press conference. According to Miles, \"I'd be a good 'bad guy' I think in a Jack Reacher movie.\"\nThe average movie villain is generally cunning, intelligent, calculated, and a bit eccentric. Based on Miles' \"Mad Hatter\" persona, he may fit the bill quite well in this capacity.\nAdChoices Go to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/RabalaisAdv/status/656162479383273472", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/LSU?src=hash", "http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.foxsports.com/college-football/story/lsu-tigers-football-cruise-davis-watching-game-in-person-101715"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:40:03.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
