The Jackson defense is led by LB Adante Davis and the TB duo of Mike Gawlik and Vincent Lee is the offensive focus.

Boston College bound QB Anthony Brown and WR Khalil Haskins are two of the big weapons for Vianney, while RFH has QB Mike O'Connor to make plays and LB Max Pfrang leads the defense. Wayne Hills (4-0) at Pascack Valley (3-0), Friday 6PM. Pascack Valley, the recent power, goes against an old power looking to recapture its invincibility of a few years ago. Pascack Valley has been challenged by Hackensack and Montclair, while Wayne Hills has yet to be tested. Valley has QB Colin Dedrick, a three year starter, and WR/DB Mike Pimpinella, while the ringleaders for Wayne Hills is TE/LB Joe Kenny and two way lineman Leyshawn Askew. Penns Grove (3-0) at Salem (3-0), Friday night . Salem won last year, 12-0 and this could be a good defensive battle, as Penns Grove has allowed 22 points and Salem 14, so far. Salem is looking to return to the finals and their offense is led by QB Shareef Jefferies and RB Jonathan Taylor. Penns Grove had two TD's by sophomore Samej Moore and one of their top defenders is linebacker Javar Garrett. Cranford (3-0) at Summit (3-0), Saturday afternoon.
