Dickey will try to get the Blue Jays even in the best-of-seven series Tuesday afternoon. He faces Kansas City's 6-foot-10 right-hander Chris Young in Game 4.\nIn the first ALCS game in Toronto since 1993, Tulowitzki connected for a three-run shot off Johnny Cueto, and Donaldson hit a two-run drive off Kris Medlen as the Blue Jays hit their first home runs of the series.\nCueto failed to retire a batter in the third inning, allowing eight runs and six hits in the worst postseason start of his career.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
