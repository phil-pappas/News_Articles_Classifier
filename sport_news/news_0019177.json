She chose coach Sue Semrau's Seminoles over DePaul and Ohio State. Ekhomu is ranked as the fifth-best point guard in her class nationally and No. 26 overall by ESPN.\n\"It was such a family atmosphere and I felt like it was like home,\" Ekhomu said. \"The coaches were great and the players were great and you could tell the town had a great interest in the program.\"\nEkhomu, a Tribune first-team All-State selection in 2014-15 , averaged 16.6 points, 5.1 assists, 3.4 rebounds, 3.8 steals and 1.3 blocks per game for the 20-9 Angels despite dealing with a stress fracture in her back that caused her to miss several games early in the season. She also played AAU ball for the Bolingbrook Panthers.\nJoliet Catholic coach Kenny Battle, a former Illinois star, called Ekhomu an elite player with tremendous upside.\n\"Elite players fit in with elite players,\" Battle said. \"She will fit in very well with them and learn and adapt, and she will bring stuff to the table as well. They are getting a tremendous student-athlete.\"\nBob Narang is a freelance reporter for the Chicago Tribune.\n Basketball ESPN", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-55ed00fc/turbine/ct-spt-0907-prep-gbk-ekhomu-florida-st-20150906"], "published": "2015-09-07T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:49:12.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
