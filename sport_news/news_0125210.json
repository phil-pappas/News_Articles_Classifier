When he was announced during warmups, he sarcastically tipped his cap to the boisterous crowd. He was booed ferociously.\nIn the first inning, when the crowd began chanting his name, he smiled, laughed, chewed his gum and blew bigger bubbles. The more he acknowledged the fans, the more they bellowed his name.\nIn the end, Cueto lost twice last night. The crowd beat him, and so did the Blue Jays, who rolled to an 11-8 win and cut the Royals’ series lead to 2-1.\nHe allowed eight runs in just more than two innings of work. And on his way off the field, the crowd chanted his name again. Again Cueto smiled, shaking his head as he walked into the dugout. Later that inning, the crowd chanted, “We want Cue-to.” More smiles, but shallow ones.\nMost pro athletes can zone out a distraction. And while Cueto said the taunting didn’t affect him, it certainly appeared to.\nIf the Red Sox put any stock into postseason performance, trying to gauge a player’s ability to pitch with millions watching, they must be utterly confused.\nCueto, who turns 30 in February, is one of the top free-agent pitchers headed for the market. According to a major league source, the Red Sox are at least considering making a serious push for the right-hander. Of course, that might not mean a lot — they’re desperate for pitching.\nBefore last night, Cueto looked like a near-perfect candidate. Velocity touching the mid-90s. Six different pitches with four different delivery methods, from the quick-pitch to a shimmy-shake where he’ll waggle his shoulders in the middle of his windup. And he’s gotten better with age, lowering his walk rate and posting a 2.71 ERA since the start of 2011 that’s only bettered by Clayton Kershaw among MLB starters.\nThe Royals don’t seem to be buyers in the rumor of elbow problems, not even bothering to put Cueto through an MRI tube. But can he handle the heat?\n“The talent is obviously there,” said Jonny Gomes, Cueto’s teammate in Cincinnati and Kansas City. “The stuff is there. I’m sure people thought about that with Jon Lester in ’07. People probably thought that about Madison Bumgarner [before 2014]. There are a lot of unanswered questions, but they have to have the opportunity. The whole Mets rotation is all unproven in big games.”\nHere’s a small sample of what the Red Sox might have to use in their analysis:\nL Starting for the Reds an elimination wild card game against the Pirates in 2013, Cueto allowed four runs and lasted just 31⁄3 innings. With the Pittsburgh crowd chanting his name, he infamously dropped the ball on the mound and allowed a home run on the very next pitch.\nL Starting in an elimination game against the Astros last week, Cueto went six innings and allowed four runs in the Royals’ win.\nAnd then there’s last night.\nHigh school coaches might use video of the game to teach emotional young pitchers what not to do. Cueto never looked comfortable, calling catcher Salvador Perez to the mound multiple times each inning.\nHe couldn’t locate. He smacked his fist in his glove and hit himself in the legs. He barked at the umpire. And against the best-hitting team in baseball, it was a recipe for disaster.\nWith Perez’ glove set up low and away in the third inning, Cueto left a fastball up and center. Troy Tulowitzki hammered it for a three-run homer.\nCueto was sunk.\nHe has Pedro Martinez-like potential, fitting since he called Martinez “somebody that I’ve always looked up to because he is a big game pitcher.” If the Red Sox are looking for good television or in-game entertainment, Cueto is their guy.\nBut after last night, the man remains a mystery. And it has little to do with his arm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:40:07.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
