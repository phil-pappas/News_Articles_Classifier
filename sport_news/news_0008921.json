All that means is that other guys have to step up.” \nSolder missed practice on Wednesday, and the team placed him on IR, according to the NFL transaction circular. The Patriots confirmed the move later Wednesday evening. \nThe Boston Globe was the first to report that Solder’s season was over. \nAs the left tackle, Solder was responsible for protecting quarterback Tom Brady’s blindside. Solder was hurt on Sunday after a play late in the second quarter in which Cowboys defensive tackle Tyrone Crawford went by him for one of five sacks of Brady. \nSolder then left the field holding his right arm, and he was replaced in the second half by Marcus Cannon. The Patriots could also move Sebastian Vollmer from the right side to the left and use Cannon at right tackle. \nThe defending Super Bowl champions are 4-0 heading into Sunday’s game against Indianapolis. Colts defensive lineman Kendell Langford said it did not change his team’s approach. \n“Well, he’s their starting left tackle. So I’m pretty sure it’s a significant loss for them,” he said. “They’ve got Tom Brady and they’ve got him (Solder) trying to protect his blind side. But again, it’s next man up.” \nAlso Wednesday, the Patriots claimed cornerback Rashaan Melvin off waivers from the Baltimore Ravens. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
