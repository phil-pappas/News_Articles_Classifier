All Quote: s courtesy of Texas Tech athletics.\nOn playing 11 games in a row this season:\nKingsbury: Yeah, I'm not sure the reason. Like I said on the teleconference, I've been part of one where we got hot and worked out, and there are also times you're kind of banged up and you like that off week. I guess for us the interesting part is like I said, that Thursday game we'll still have practice on that weekend, so it's not a free weekend for three straight months. So just kind of how it fell this year. Everybody takes their turn with that Thanksgiving game, and it just worked out that way.\nOn his concerns going into Saturday's game against Kansas:\nKingsbury: I know they're well-coached, being very familiar with Coach (David) Beaty. I think Coach Bowen did a great job last year as interim head coach and playing hard. So defensively they'll be lined up and playing well. They're trying to build it. Playing a true freshman quarterback, I know what that's like. But they're still a well-coached team, that anybody in the Big 12 can beat anybody on any given day. So we have to be prepared and make sure we try to get better this week.\nOn his biggest takeaway on Beaty:\nKingsbury: Tremendous recruiter. I think when we got to Texas A&M, he had a veteran group of wide receivers and Mike Evans who was a young guy and watched the way he handled that group. He had Ryan Swope. It was just really impressive to get Mike Evans to the level he did that quickly and manage those older guys and gain their respect very quickly. I think he's a tremendous football coach. I know he's trying to build something special out there.\nOn not taking winless Kansas lightly:\nKingsbury: Yeah, I think we're talking about starting the second half of our season the right way, and that's been our focus is getting better each week, and that's what we'll try to do this week. You look to last year when TCU went on the road to Kansas, and Kansas almost got them there. So it's great to point out that it is a good football team that's well-coached, and they had a tough run, but they're getting better. They have young players. So we just need to continue to get better ourselves.\nOn Patrick Mahomes' play midway through the season:\nKingsbury: He's getting better. He made some tremendous plays on Saturday where he just\nkind of made it all happen. But he's getting more comfortable in the system. Watching him operate, everything's happening at the line of scrimmage faster. He made some great checks, and so now it's just continue to protect the football and when things are there throughout the read, get it to him. If it's not, now go do that stuff that you can do. He's got a chance to be very, very good if he continues to work hard at it.\nOn the status of wide receivers Devin Lauderdale and Dylan Cantrell:\nKingsbury: Devin will be back this week, Dylan Cantrell will not. ... Still a possibility (Cantrell will redshirt).\nOn Mahomes' knee, which was injured against TCU:\nKingsbury: It's getting better. He said today it felt better than it has, so that's encouraging. ... The term I was given was some sort of sprain.\nOn running back Justin Stockton:\nKingsbury: He's a very talented back. One of the fastest players on our team. Any time he touches it, he can go the distance. Those guys do a great job of pushing each other and working with each other. DeAndre's the proven veteran leader on our offense. That's really been fun to watch him help Justin. They have a great relationship, but DeAndre knows he's got a really good back right behind him.\nOn his routine when the defense is on the field:\nKingsbury: Yeah, first you try to give encouraging words to the defense, and then Coach\nMorris, Coach Jinks and Coach Hays and I are on the headset talking about our next drive and what we're trying to do. Meanwhile I'm trying to pay attention to the defense in the situation. Just trying to take it all in while we're prepping for our next drive.\nOn if the defense looked better on film than what he initially thought Saturday:\nKingsbury: It's always not as bad as you think or as good as you think. But I think there are\nsome guys growing up, some of those young linebackers, some young guys in the safety. Then\nBreiden Fehoko gets better each week. The guy that's really standing out to me is Branden Jackson, how hard he's playing. He looks like night and day. The film this year as opposed to last year, just effort, consistently play in, and play out.\nOn Twitter:\n @TommyMagelssen", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TommyMagelssen"], "published": "2015-10-12T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:43:27.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
