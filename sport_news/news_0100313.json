Despite holding a 1-0 lead after 20 minutes of play, the Devils notched four straight power-play scores over the final 40 minutes of play to claim the win. Matt Puempel notched his third goal of the year when he knocked home a rebound on a power-play chance from a Nick Paul scoring chance with just over 1:30 to play in the opening period to give the B-Sens the 1-0 lead heading into intermission. With Albany working the power play, Matt Lorito snuck one past a diving Matt O’Connor to even the score 1-1 6:33 into the second frame. Corey Tropp made it 2-1 with less than 6 minutes to play in the period to give the hosts the one goal advantage heading into the final break. Joseph Blandisi recorded his second score of the year 6:44 into the final period off a feed from Lorito to make it 3-1. Reid Boucher pushed the final score to 4-1 with a power-play tally with just over nine minutes to play in regulation.
