Our offensive line was phenomenal.” \nThe Falcons hadn’t allowed a 100-yard rusher all season, nor given up two touchdowns in a game since September. Peabody, which has struggled offensively in its three losses this year, played with the fire of a group bent on erasing that stigma. \nThe Tanner offense had its best evening this fall, with Santos carrying 28 times for his seventh straight 100-yard game (and also the 8th 200-yard game of his career). Peabody had 332 total yards to Danvers’ 200. \n“This whole week we knew we were coming in as underdogs. We wanted to win so bad and that energy drove us. It feels like we switched on a switch,” said Santos. “We’ve grown up and become something people didn’t think we could become.” \nDanvers trailed 14-0 at halftime and asserted itself on the opening drive of the second half. Senior captain Danny Lynch’s 15-yard touchdown capped an 11-play, five-minute drive to make it a one-score game. Danvers’ defense then came up with a stop, but Peabody’s defense responded with a stop of its own to retain the lead. \n“It’s a major letdown. We made a lot of mistakes and they kind of beat us up,” said Danvers head coach Shawn Theriault, whose team had a 20-play drive end without points in the first half. The Falcons were also plagued by six penalties that seemed to come at the worst possible times. \n“We can’t put ourselves in 1st-and-20, 2nd-and-15, 3rd-and-10 situations. When we do what we do, we’re very effective. When we put ourselves in holes, we have a tough time climbing out of them.” \nWhen Peabody got the ball back with the one-score lead, Santos took the first handoff 53 yards to the end zone. He made a cut around an Eric DeMayo block on a crucial scamper to stretch his team’s lead. \n“We were fizzling and I told Doug, ‘You need to take this game over.’ I told Eric, ‘You need to make the block that springs him.’ We needed someone to make a play — they did,” Bettencourt said. \nDanvers took a smashmouth approach offensively and generally did a solid job churning out first downs. Lynch carried 16 times for 85 yards and junior Matt Andreas rushed 22 times for 92 yards, frequently converting on third-and-short. \nThroughout the night, Peabody’s Frank Falco (sack on fourth down), Jake Doherty and Cam Cordaro (two passes broken up on third down) seemed to make situational plays to derail Danvers drives. \n“We were very active on defense. Danvers was the heavier team and we tried to use our quickness. DeMayo was a beast in the middle and Falco and Doherty were all over the place,” said Bettencourt. “I was very happy with the way we stepped up on third and fourth downs.” \nBehind 7-0 after Okananawa’s 43-yard touchdown run opened the scoring (“I was so fired up about that. Uggy made this crazy hip move; he’s so good when he gets his chance,” Santos said), Danvers gave it back to the hosts with an interception made by Gutierez. \nSantos powered into the end zone from the 1-yard line on the final snap of the half, with came with some confusion as the previous play went off with only 10 seconds left. The clock stopped because of a first down, the officials explained to Theriault. \n“It seemed close enough to measure, but that’s the way it goes,” Theriault said. \n“I hope we take this as a learning experience. Anything can happen with the playoffs now. Everybody’s 0-0 starting next week.” \nDanvers turned it over on downs with with 6:16 to play, and Santos scored his third touchdown with 2:36 remaining. Gutierez made his second interception shortly thereafter, effectively sealing the win for Peabody. \n“It feels like we’re grasping that we can be good if we want to be good,” Santos said. “If you believe, if you have heart, you can get it done.” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:48:07.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
