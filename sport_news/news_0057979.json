Yuvraj, who has just played a knock of 187 in the ongoing Ranji Trophy, is an option for selectors but they chose to ignore him.\nAsked if he was surprised by the selectors' decision, Gavaskar said, \"not really\". \"Yuvraj had been given the signal when he was left out of the 2015 World Cup squad. They showed that they are going to look ahead. \nBut yes after his performance in Ranji there was hope that he may be recalled. \"My personal view is that pick the best combination which has youth and experience. We don't have anyone at number five and Yuvraj could have provided (experience).\nYou can't call Suresh Raina inexperienced who is been around for 10 years but Yuvraj makes a big difference and I feel sorry for him. I don't think he has that opportunity for one last fling at glory,\" Gavaskar told NDTV. Gavaskar said India must strive to win the series otherwise, playing South Africa in the Test series will become more difficult.\nIndia lost the T20 series and trail the ODI series 1-2. \"Priority should be to win the series. This South African attack with red ball will be a different cup of tea. If India win ODI series, it might affect the confidence of South Africa little bit.\nYes, have a look at the results. Matches were close, margins were not overwhelming. If they win one game and that they will have confidence of winning two also.\" He also said the Indian players \"don't know what their job is\" as Ajinkya Rahane was dropped down to number six after scoring two fifties at nunber three.\nTalking about possibility of a Indo-Pak series, Gavaskar felt that the situation needs to imrpve for that to happen. \"You need sombody to calm it down a bit then have a look at the resumption of series,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:47:54.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
