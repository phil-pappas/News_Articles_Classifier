After the mass shooting in Oregon, he’s once again speaking out, writing a column for the NY Daily News .\nThe emotional column reads as a letter begging legislators to react and work toward gun legislation to help prevent gun violence. Here are three impactful Quote: s that capture Parker’s frustration and despair over gun violence in this country.\nParker opened the column by calling on Republican lawmakers, who he said refuse to act.\n Shame on them for being the cowards that they are. Is the support of a fringe element of the NRA so important that they are willing to accept our children as collateral damage? We are at war in this country, and we must win – whatever it takes.\nParker’s daughter was killed on August 25, a little over a month ago. In the column, he said Alison’s shooter, who was a former coworker, should not have had access to a gun because there were numerous red flags.\nWhen I heard about this shooting in Oregon, I thought, this can’t be. Not this soon. I knew it would happen again. We are a country with a strong gun culture. But I wasn’t expecting it to be this soon.\nHe likened the issue of gun violence to a cancer.\nWe need to try different things. It’s like treating cancer. You don’t have just one type of therapy to treat cancer. You have to take several steps. And if this isn’t a cancer in this country, I don’t know what it is.\nThe entire column is really powerful and definitely worth your time.
