Comment Posted Oct. 26, 2015 at 3:12 AM Updated at 3:15 AM Posted Oct. 26, 2015 at 3:12 AM Updated at 3:15 AM WALTHAM – They compiled the fifth-best winning percentage over the final 10 weeks of the 2014-15 NBA season. The Celtics went 24-12 (.667) from Feb. 3 until the end of the season on April 15, moving from 14 games below .500 into the seventh playoff spot in the Eastern Conference at 40-42. Only the champion Golden State Warriors (31-7, .816), the San Antonio Spurs (25-9, .735), the Cleveland Cavaliers (23-9, .718) and the Los Angeles Clippers (23-10, .696) had better winning percentages than the Celtics in that span. The surge got the Celtics an opening-round playoff date with LeBron James and the Cavaliers, who swept the series in four games. Six months later, the Celtics will return to the TD Garden on Wednesday night to open the 2015-16 season against the Philadelphia 76ers, and the expectations have been boosted a bit after the strong finish last winter and spring. Though lacking an elite player to put them in the NBA’s upper echelon, the Celtics have depth that should make them contenders for a return trip to the postseason. Ten of the 15 players on the roster return from last season, and the goal is to build on what occurred from early February until April. The quick exit at the hands of the Cavaliers left the Celtics wanting more. “It was a great learning experience for all of us,’’ said coach Brad Stevens, who is entering his third season. “Hopefully, it’s a motivation thing that we didn’t play as well once we got there. “It should be motivating from the standpoint that we did have some really good moments against the class of the East. We’ll find out if we’re able to take some of those lessons forward.’’ The Celtics were seemingly lottery bound after a Super Bowl Sunday loss to the Miami Heat on Feb. 1, but some roster moves before the trade deadline helped turn things around. They took advantage of the weak Eastern Conference where three teams .500 or below made the playoffs. “With the run we had at the end, we hit a stride,’’ said Kelly Olynyk. “We have to keep running, keep that stride going. We’re a close-knit group now and hopefully we can start of with a bang.’’ Said Evan Turner: “I think we have crazy momentum. I think it’s going to be fun. We added the right pieces. I think we do a lot of good things. What did we have, 40 wins last year? We’re going to be really good.’’ Stevens has reminded everyone that the Celtics were closer to 12th place (eight games) than they were to fourth (nine games) last season. Page 2 of 2 - So with teams improving in the conference, how far can these Celtics go? “I don’t know. I’m not sure,’’ said president of basketball operations Danny Ainge. “We’ll see. I think we have to do it in a different way than (teams with) stars. “We have to use our depth and play like we did last year at the end of the season and carry that momentum over, move the ball. “I think it’s really important that we share and move the ball and not have anybody try to be a star. Collectively as a team, we have to be better than any of our individuals.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T10:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:46:44.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
