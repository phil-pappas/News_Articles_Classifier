He was taken by ambulance to the hospital and the remainder of the game was canceled. \nHe had undergone emergency surgery for a brain injury, according to reports. \nBui was listed in critical condition as of Sunday, a hospital spokeswoman told The Seattle Times. His family had requested privacy and has not commented on the injury. \nBui becomes the fourth high school football player to die because of an on-field injury in the last month. His death follows the passing of Tyrell Cameron from Franklin Parrish (La.), who suffered a neck injury; Ben Hamm from Wesleyan Christian School (Bartlesville, Okla.), who died eight days after a hit to the head; and Evan Murray (Warren Hills, N.J., Regional), who died from bleeding caused by a lacerated spleen. \nBui was one of two Seattle area football players who had been hospitalized after serious injuries suffered Friday night while making tackles. \nDavid Young, a senior at Adna (Chehalis, Wash.), suffered a broken bone in his neck, coach K.C. Johnson told The Seattle Times , and is in serious condition. He has been fitted with a halo brace. \nYoung was injured on the fifth play of the game. He walked off the field and then complained of neck pain. The coaches pulled him from the game and said he needed to be examined. Young went to the hospital. \nThe injuries to Bui and Young came a week after another player in the Seattle area, Ramon Angel-Oros from Pateros High, collapsed during a game. He had surgery to relieve swelling in his brain and doctors fear he could be paraplegic. His family says he has been able to move one of his arms and one of his legs a little bit.
