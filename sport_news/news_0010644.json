Long Shot – 4 An Unusual Group Race 6 – 1 1/16th miles, Purse $19,000, Claiming $16,000, 3-year-olds and up1 Blackford – Should get a beautiful trip from the rail in this 2-turn route; has enough back class where he should be able to coast by in the long stretch run. 4 Ice Cream Truck – Trainer A. C. Avila has found out why this horse has only two wins from 38 starts; he is camera shy, but still productive with eight seconds.Long Shot – 5 A Colt Following Race 7 – 1 1/8th miles (turf, rail at 30 feet), Purse $55,000, Optional claiming $62,500, Fillies and mares, 3-year-olds and up5 Last Kiss – Interesting Brazilian import makes her U.S. debut tonight; gets to race first time with Lasix and jockey James Graham gets a live shot from Neil Drysdale.1 Bottle Blonde – Despite winning two races in a row, gets her third different jockey in a row; her last winning jockey Flavien Prat is injured so it’s an obvious change.Long Shot – 7 Royal Temptress Race 8 – 6 furlongs, Purse $17,000, Maiden claiming $20,000, Fillies and mares, 3-year-olds and up1 Stellata – This is strictly a leap of faith in Rafael Bejarano and his agent; when a top jock stays for the finale in a cheap race, I suspect the horse is very live.11 Canadian Exchange – Claimed by trainer Peter Miller and put right back into the same class; not often you see a top trainer take a horse out of a $20K maiden claimer.Long Shot – 3 Just Bookin Best Bet - 1 Blackford (race 6)Santa Anita Thursday - Picks/Winners/Mutuels, 15/3/$19.60; Long Shots, 8/2/$27.40; Best Bet, 1/0/$0Santa Anita Totals - 119/27/$161.20; Long Shots, 60/13/$183.60; Best Bets, 5/2/$5.60SIMULCAST PLAY OF THE DAY - #5 Ageless (3/1) in race 9 at Keeneland. For scoring purposes, we'll make a hypothetical $2 win, place and show bet, $6 total. On Thursday, Rumble Doll won at Belmont Park paying $4.80 to win, 43.00 to place and $2.40 to show.
