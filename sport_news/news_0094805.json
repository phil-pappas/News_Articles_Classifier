Photo by Oleg Nikishin/Getty Images Cholera cases have been rising at alarming rates along thr Eurphrates Valley in just the past month. According to health ministry spokesman Rifaq al-Araji, more than 1,800 cases, the most diagnosed, with the hardest hit areas located in the areas of Baghdad and Babil, south of the capital with more than 500 cases each. The disease has been blamed for the death of 6 people including in the Abu Ghraib region, and is reportedly spreading north into the Kurdish provinces of Arbil and Dohuk. A previous outbreak had killed four people in the Kurdistan region in 2012.\nCholera is an infection of the small intestine by some strains of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Symptoms may range from none, to mild vomiting and stomach cramps as well as watery diarrhea that can continue for days leading to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance within hours. This can lead to sunken eyes, cold skin, decreased skin elasticity, and wrinkling of the hands and feet. The dehydration may also result in bluish-skin. Symptoms start two hours to five days after exposure.[2]\nCholera affects an estimated 3–5 million people worldwide and causes 58,000–130,000 deaths a year as of 2010. Areas with an ongoing risk of disease include Africa and south-east Asia, with children being the most vulnerable patients.\nWhile the risk of death among those affected is usually less than 5%, it may be as high as 50% among some groups who don't have access to treatment. In the meantime, while cholera is currently classified as a pandemic, it is rare in the developed world. The disease is caused by a number of types of Vibrio cholerae, bacteria, with some types producing more severe disease than others. It is spread mostly by water and food that has been soiled by contaminated human feces, as well as poor sanitation in general. Insufficiently cooked seafood is another common source. Humans are the only animal affected.\nRisk factors for the disease include poor sanitation, revention involves improved sanitation and access to clean water. Cholera vaccines that are given by mouth provide reasonable protection for about six months. They have the added benefit of protecting against another type of diarrhea caused by E. coli. The primary treatment is oral rehydration therapy—the replacement of fluids with slightly sweet and salty solutions rice-based solutions are preferred Zinc supplementation is useful in children. In severe cases, intravenous fluids, such as Ringer's lactate, may be required, and antibiotics may be beneficial. Testing to see what antibiotic the cholera is susceptible to can help guide the choice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:37:17.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
