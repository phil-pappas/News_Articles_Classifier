Comment Posted Oct. 10, 2015 at 2:07 AM Posted Oct. 10, 2015 at 2:07 AM The Bullpups went to Winfield looking to keep some momentum going into the districts. Tyson Stites took the opening kickoff back for a touchdown, and McPherson never looked back in a 61-0 drubbing of the Vikings. Jack Reifschneider had a pair of touchdowns for the Bullpups, and Austen Hunt continued his strong play as of late with a touchdown of his own. The opportunistic defense that carried McPherson to a win over Salina South, came back to play in Winfield. Wyatt Seidl, and Britton Bate scored back-to-back defensive touchdowns for McPherson with fumble recoveries.
