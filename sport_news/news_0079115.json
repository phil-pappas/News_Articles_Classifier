Duke safety Deondre Singleton delivered a hit just as a toss from quarterback Ahmad Bradshaw arrived. Defensive coordinator Jim Knowles had dialed up a run blitz at the perfect moment on Army’s 4th-and-1 from its 35-yard line late in the first quarter. Singleton’s blow sent the ball flying backward. Army would recover 18 yards later on its 17 but turned the ball over on downs. Duke’s defense should improve in its No. 9 national ranking after a 44-3 win at West Point. For the second time in three weeks, Duke shut down a triple-option offense. The Blue Devils held Army to 113 rushing yards, 174 below its average. Duke limited Georgia Tech to 173 yards in a 34-20 win on Sept. 26. \"The key to beating a team that runs the triple option is to play your schemes,” Duke senior linebacker Jeremy Cash said. “Don't try to do too much. \"We came in with a chip on our shoulder. We started something this year and that's the mentality of winning, expecting to win. We've just got to keep it rolling.\" Duke (5-1) has now allowed just 56 points this season. Opponents have only scored five touchdowns on Duke’s defense. The Blue Devils have held four of its opponents to seven points or less. \"Our defense has been consistent all year,\" Duke coach David Cutcliffe said. \"Our line of scrimmage is good. You've got to block us, and it's not easy to do that. Then you put the kind of speed we've got on the field ... and we are by far the fastest defense we've had at Duke and hopefully will continue to grow.\" Cutcliffe thinks Duke’s defense can get better – a scary thought. sinterdonato@th-record.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:11:27.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
