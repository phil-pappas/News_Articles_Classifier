AFP PHOTO / OLIVIER MORIN (Photo credit should read OLIVIER MORIN/AFP/Getty Images)\nItalian champions and last season's runner-up Juventus maintained their unbeaten start to the Champions League after a 0-0 draw against Borussia Mönchengladbach.\nAdChoices The Foals turned in a disciplined and organized performance to keep a clean sheet and build upon the confidence under new coach Andre Schubert. Under the interim boss, Gladbach have won all four league games whilst turning in respectable performances in the Champions League against Manchester City and Juventus.\nA point does little to help Gladbach's hopes of reaching the Last 16, but the Bundesliga side are off the mark at least. Juventus were coming off the back of a draw with Inter Milan as their weak domestic campaign continues to fizzle out already.\nDespite sitting nine points off the top of Serie A, The Old Lady are unbeaten in 10 at home in the Champions League. But Max Allegri's squad has been decimated since the Champions League final in Berlin: Arturo Vidal, Andrea Pirlo and Carlos Tevez have all left for pastures new this year. While Juventus are one of the continent's leading sides, Gladbach are improving having spent most of the first four weeks bottom of the league.\nSchubert has injected confidence into many underperforming players, such as Lars Stindl or Andre Hahn. In midfield, he has a gem in Mahmoud Dahoud who again was one of the most assured players on the pitch. The 19-year-old's passing ability is wonderful and he has already taken the responsibility in the team's engine room.\nOn eight minutes, Raffael blazed a shot wide of the post from 30 yards out. However, chances for Andre Schubert's men were limited in the first half as Juventus dominated. Alvaro Morata and midfielder Paul Pogba linked superbly on 16 minutes, the former Real Madrid striker striking over the top. Four minutes later, Frenchman Pogba dragged a left-foot shot past Yann Sommer's post.\nFormer Chelsea man Juan Cuadrado made little contribution on the right, but did test Sommer next on 22 minutes. Pogba was soon on the scene once more and this time, rifled his shot from 30 yards past the corner of the post.\nOn the counterattack, the Foals were ready to hurt Juventus. Schubert, the interim successor to Lucien Favre, has built his team around fast, rapid wide men with Fabian Johnson and Lars Stindl playing roles. There was a fleeting glimpse of the attacking play from recent weeks in the 36th minute. Traore showed pace and skill to drive down the left-flank, his cross at the back post cleared by Giorgio Chiellini to prevent Raffael finishing off the move.\nBut after the restart, the Old Lady found their rhythm again. Just a few seconds into the second half, Pogba brought out an excellent save from Sommer whose excellent goalkeeping skills have saved Gladbach from potential embarrassment in this tournament.\nTen minutes later, Pogba set up Morata with a splendid chipped ball but the former Real Madrid striker saw his shot hit the side-netting. The Frenchman was pivotal to everything good about Juventus' game and Pogba showed his brilliance and forced Sommer into another save.\nWith less than 10 minutes left, Pogba missed the target once more with a long-range drive. But the Foals were already in lockdown mode, sitting deep in order to block any spaces opening up for the Juventus attackers. In the end, Juventus and Gladbach both earned their points in a disappointing game of football. Gladbach are bottom of the group after three games with just one point, while Juventus have seven from nine ahead of their clash at Borussia-Park next month.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:43:48.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
