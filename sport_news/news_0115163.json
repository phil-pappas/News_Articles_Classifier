Chinedu Udeogu Georgetown Prep (North Bethesda, Md.) class of 2016 DE Chinedu Udeogu (Photo courtesy of 247Sports.com, used with permission) Comments \nRutgers and Cal still lead for Chinedu Udeodu , a 6-4, 248-pound senior defensive end from Georgetown Prep (North Bethesda, Md.). \nThe three-star prospect had expected to make his collegiate commitment in September, but held off as he realized he wasn't ready. \n\"I've been saying like, 'It's gonna be this week' for a while now, so I'd really just say hopefully before the season ends, which is in about the next month,\" said Udeogu. \"I don't really want to say a date just because I honestly don't know specifically what day I'm gonna make the decision.\" \nPitt and Maryland have an outside shot of landing Udeogu's services, but for the most part, his recruitment is a two team race. \n\"Right now, I have Rutgers and Cal on top,\" he said. \"And I'm definitely interested in Pitt. I'm interested in Maryland. They haven't offered me, but I'm interested in them.\" \nRELATED: 3-star defensive end Chinedu Udeogu down to Rutgers and Cal as his decision approaches \nSo what is Udeogu waiting for? \n\"I know what they both have to offer. They are both great schools. Really, right now it's about what's gonna be best for me and where I'm gonna be most comfortable at. It's really not as much about the schools, right now. It's just about me and what I'm comfortable with,\" he said. \nDespite the challenges the Rutgers program has faced over the past month-and-a-half, which resulted in a three-game suspension for head coach Kyle Flood, Udeogu's opinion of Rutgers hasn't changed. \n\"I feel great about Rutgers. Even when coach Flood was suspended, it didn't really bother me. It didn't really affect anything for me,\" said Udeogu. \"I think they are headed in the right direction for sure. I watched their game last week and it was really good to see them succeeding. I'm just happy for them and just looking forward to the big game against Ohio State .\" \nUdeogu has yet to take any official visits as his high school football schedule hasn't allowed for it. But he hopes to have enough information to make an informed decision, soon. \n\"I'm still talking to coaches and I've been invited to some games and stuff, but I haven't really had the chance to schedule anything because the next three weeks I have three Saturday games,\" he said. \"So I can't really make any visits any time soon. But I still keep in contact and I'll make my decision sometime here soon.\" \nIn addition to football, Udeogu also participates in track and field, where he throws the shot-put and discuss, with respective bests of 156 and 46 feet. \nAn Illinois native, he moved with his family to Nigeria for nine years before returning to the United States when he was in ninth grade, and began to play American football. \nAlthough he boards in Maryland, his family still resides in the Prairie State. \nAs Rutgers continues to build their 2016 recruiting class, take a look at the players they signed in 2015, below: \nTodderick Hunt may be reached at thunt@njadvancemedia.com .
