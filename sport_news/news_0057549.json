(Photo by Jonathan Newton / The Washington Post) \nAs this season began, the Washington Nationals and their owners gushed with optimism, and rightfully so. They’d added a former Cy Young Award Winner to an already impressive starting rotation, secured the 2018 All-Star Game, and built a roster with the largest payroll in team history. \nWhat happened in the months since has been well-documented, but as those in the front office and clubhouse have voiced their reaction to the team’s demise, the Lerner family and the other principal owners stayed silent. They deferred to their de facto spokesperson Mike Rizzo to be the voice of the franchise. They declined repeated requests for comment to the late-season slide through a team spokeswoman. \nThis week, they broke their silence, choosing an official statement released on the team’s website. In it, the Nationals’ ownership did not speak to blame or changes to come — topics they have not broached publicly this year — but instead focused on thanking Nationals fans for their support through it all. \n“One thing we’ve all learned together is that this game will break your heart,” said the letter, signed by eight owners, who also added the team is hard at work to improve for 2016 because the desire to do better “burns stronger than ever.” \nThe Nationals will clear around $50 million in payroll this offseason when stars such as Ian Desmond and Jordan Zimmermann depart via free agency. Given the spike in team payroll, the Lerners seem unlikely to throw all that money at free agents, more likely to let the payroll level off a bit and plug holes where needed. Franchise pillars such as Stephen Strasburg and Bryce Harper will likely earn massive deals in the coming years, meaning budgetary foresight is a must. \nThe Lerners have not spoken specifically about payroll this season, though they are generally unwilling to spend freely on big free agents. Max Scherzer’s arrival this offseason surprised many because it was not in keeping with the Lerner’s normal approach to free agent spending, and indicated to many a win-now willingness that ultimately did not bring them the title they hoped it would. \nThe full text of the letter from Nationals ownership, as published on the team’s website, can be seen below. \nDear Nationals Fans, \nThank you for your unwavering support. Your passion, energy, and love for the game of baseball never goes unnoticed — not by our players, not by our front office, and certainly not by our family. You are the heart and soul of the Washington Nationals. \nOne thing we’ve all learned together is that this game will break your heart. It can happen even when you have so many memorable moments: the announcement of the 2018 All-Star Game coming to Nationals Park; the largest (and perhaps most dramatic) comeback in Nationals history on a cool April night in Atlanta; Max Scherzer’s two nearly-perfect, exceptionally dominant no-hitters to join Jordan Zimmermann in Nationals lore; Bryce Harper’s MVP season; the consistent contributions of our rookies and so much more. \nBut over the past 10 years we’ve also learned one other thing: Each Opening Day brings a new opportunity. \nWe are already hard at work improving our club for the 2016 season, making certain that we continue to put the best product possible on the field each night. Our desire to do better – to be better – burns stronger than ever. \nAfter looking back at ten years of memories, we now look forward to what’s next on this journey. We can’t thank you enough for taking this ride with us. We’re already counting the days until Opening Day at Nationals Park on April 7, 2016!” Chelsea Janes covers the Nationals for The Washington Post. sports Success! Check your inbox for details.
