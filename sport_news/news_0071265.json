I really feel for them.\nThey were all looking forward to us ... playing over there so hopefully we can get an opportunity to get over there at some time.”\nCricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said late Thursday that an independent security assessment confirmed the “risk of terrorism in Bangladesh targeting Australian nationals.”\nSmith said the focus had now moved on to preparing for the southern summer visit of the Kiwis, with the first of three Tests starting on Nov. 5 in Brisbane. “New Zealand have played some very good cricket of late,” he said. — Agencies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:29:59.747+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
