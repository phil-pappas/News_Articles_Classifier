It wasn't how I wanted to end this thing, but at the same time, it just felt like for me, as a person of faith, I felt like that's where the journey had led me. \n\"It's where I was supposed to be. It was just trusting that process and certainly things before it because it allowed not only for me to grow as a football player, but to grow as a man. It tested my faith, certainly, but I'm better for it.\" \nIn addition to rushing for a score in the win over Baltimore, McCown completed 36 of his 51 throws for 457 yards and two touchdowns. The 457 yards surpassed the previous franchise record of 444 collected by Brian Sipe against the Baltimore Colts on October 25, 1981. \nSince returning from the concussion he suffered on the opening drive of the regular season against the New York Jets, McCown has increased his passing yards in each of the last three weeks, and his total of 1,154 yards in the against the Oakland Raiders, San Diego Chargers and Ravens are the most in a three-game stretch by any quarterback in Browns history. \nIn totaling 457 yards against the Ravens, he became the first Browns quarterback to have three straight 300-yard passing performances. \n\"As a player, if you're going to have success and as a quarterback, I don't know if you necessarily want to find yourself in a game like that, but at the same time, you can envision playing at a high level and executing at a high level and the guys around you playing at a high level and the game dictates being able do stuff like that,\" McCown said. \n\"As a quarterback you love throwing it. Don't get me wrong; it's fun. Not all the time, but a lot of times, if you're throwing it that much, it's probably because you're behind or you're not able to run the ball or something like that. If you find yourself in a game like that, it's typically negative circumstances, but that's not always the case and it wasn't (Sunday). \n\"Sometimes, the game just dictates the ball has to be thrown around. We said from the start, we wanted to do both effectively and we were able to do that.\" \nMcCown said he was unaware of breaking the franchise's records until he was celebrating the victory in the locker room with his teammates. However, when McCown was told of the feats, he was grateful to have the opportunity to thank those responsible for his success. \n\"Without those guys, none of the individual things matter or can happen, so it was fun to be a part of that group,\" McCown said. \"Again, I don't know if surprised is the right word just because we said it from the spring, we're capable of doing some good things on offense and we felt really good in the spring with this group. \n\"We continue to feel that way, so obviously, the games have dictated that we throw the ball a lot, but we're able to do that effectively and help our team win, so that's all I care about. The record stuff and all that will maybe be fun to talk about one day, but right now, it's doing what it takes to help our team win a game.\" \nWith a young set of skill-position players around McCown on offense, Browns coach Mike Pettine said his recent streak of 300-yard performances has \"been tremendous.\" \n\"He's a guy you root for, but a big thing to talk about is understanding how well we're playing around him,\" Pettine said. \"The backs have stepped their game up. The offensive line is improving. The receivers are playing well. Just to have a guy that can be that calming influence, he doesn't get too up; he doesn't get too down. He's always very positive on the sideline. \n\"He'll be the first one to criticize himself and say he missed a throw or he missed a read or missed a change in the protection or getting us in the right place. His success, while on the outside of the building is surprising, the people that were here in the spring with him and watched him through training camp and just how he handed his business, we knew if we played well around him that he was capable of this.\" \nLike Pettine predicted, although McCown completed 36 of his throws in the win over Baltimore, he spoke of his mistakes for much of his postgame press conference. And should his ankle be healthy enough to practice on after he rolled it in the Browns' first win in Baltimore since 2007, McCown plans on working on those miscues in order to keep that hot streak going for the offense. \n\"Sometimes, I think it's human nature for us, or at least for me, but for us, always focus on the negative and not realize how many good things are happening,\" McCown said. \"Also, I feel like as a player, when you're pushing to play at a high level, that's what gives you that edge is because you don't accept those misses. \n\"You deal with them when you have them in the game, but you also have to let them fuel you to want to be better and to want to not allow it to happen. For me, there's a ton of stuff that I'm not pleased with to be quite honest with you. Just looking over the last few weeks, starting from the way we finished against Oakland and the different spots throughout the San Diego game and (Sunday) where I just feel like the execution could be better. \n\"That's what we'll keep striving for. I don't know if it's ever possible to throw a perfect game, but you want to get as close as you can. I felt really good about (Sunday), but I still feel like we left some things out there. I know I left some things out there that could've been a lot better, need to be tightened up for sure, so (I'm) looking forward to getting back this week and working on those things. \" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1RF6DS0 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:47:17.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
