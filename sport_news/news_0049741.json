Those gains were offset by four turnovers and nine penalties. The whole offensive meltdown was accentuated by two missed red-zone field goals by freshman kicker Colton Lichtenberg.\nThe game’s lone score came on Mike Weaver’s 25-yard field goal in the third quarter. The Demon Deacons had recovered an Eagles fumble on the BC 5.\nBC had two opportunities to either win or tie the game in the final two minutes and failed both times. Flutie tried a keeper on third-and-inches on the Wake 8-yard line and fumbled the ball away with 1:03 remaining.\nThe Deacons returned the favor when freshman tailback Matt Colburn was stripped by linebacker Matt Milano. Free safety Justin Simmons recovered the ball on the Wake 11 with 56 seconds left.\nBC got a first-and-goal from the 1-yard line on a 9-yard run by Smith with 29 seconds remaining and no timeouts. Addazio sent in two plays while the clock was stopped to move the chains.\nThe simple package included a run between the tackles by tailback Tyler Rouse and for Smith to spike the ball if the run failed. Addazio intended to let backup kicker Mike Knoll attempt the game-tying field goal.\nWake stuffed Rouse on a dive play at the line of scrimmage, but the junior kept grinding his legs, burning precious seconds. By the time the refs dislodged the pile, time expired on BC’s comeback.\n“All was set there, everything was in line and pre-done,” Addazio said. “There was not confusion and everything was done appropriately but this is where we are right now.\n“Quite frankly I thought we are going to win the game right there. I thought on the last play we were going to score a touchdown and win the game.”\nThe Eagles entered the game as the top-ranked defense in the country and played up to expectations. BC held Wake to 142 yards of total offense, five first downs and forced two turnovers. The Eagles contained Wake’s power run and short passing games with 11 tackles for loss for a total of 34 yards.\n“We are playing great (defense), just relentless,” Addazio said. “We have older guys that have played a lot of football and they are playing really good football.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:36:59.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
