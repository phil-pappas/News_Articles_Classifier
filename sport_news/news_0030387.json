If you have not read it, then please do.\nHe compares our homicide rate to other areas — St. Louis and Detroit. We are 9.8/100,000, and they are 50 and 44/100,000 respectively. I agree, Chief Lumpkin is the right guy with a proven track record, as well as a need for culture change in the community. But this culture change requires a lot of hard work and will take some time.\nRecently, with another shooting at a college in Oregon, President Barack Obama is back on his pedestal calling for more gun control, as if it is working so well in St. Louis, Detroit or Chicago, Obama’s home town.\nIn 2015, Chicago has had 1,700 shootings, 50 each the past two weekends, up from 20 percent last year and 350 people have been killed. These cities have the strictest gun control laws in the country, and the highest homicide and violent crime rates in the country.\nWhat is needed?\nWe protect our money in banks with armed guards. We need to protect our children in schools and universities the same way.\nThese so called gun free zones are killing a lot of people. A criminal’s greatest fear is he will be shot by his intended victim.\nThey have no fear in these gun free zones.\nWe have criminal databases, as well as for the mentally ill, but are we keeping them updated and utilizing them properly?\nED NEAL\nSavannah\nIt’s time to do something\nI think it is about time that the teachers and their union start screaming and hollering and get the schools safe for our children.\nIt is 100 percent the responsibility of the public officials and the school officials to make sure all students are safe from the time they get on a bus until they get home.\nMore and more students are being pulled out of public schools every year by their parents because they don’t know if their kids are going to come back home anymore. It is a messed up world nowadays, but the fact is, once you put your children in somebody else’s possession you expect them to do everything possible to make sure that your child is safe from harm. The more students that are pulled out of public schools mean there is less reason to have so many teachers.\nThe teachers’ jobs are on the line because the school will not do whatever is necessary to protect our children.\nI don’t care if you have to put an armed resource officer at every corner of every hallway, and I don’t care if you put metal detectors at every single door. I don’t care if you search every single bag before they come into the school, and I don’t care if people fuss about the rights to privacy.\nWhen my children go to a public school, I should know they will not be harmed at that school.\nIt’s time that they do something and not just apologize for what happened after its done.\nLEE COOK\nPort Wentworth\nHillary bobs and\nweaves to win\nWhile shorter, I thought Hillary stood taller last night in a sea of midgets. No one put a glove on her, for fear she might retaliate as president and ignore them for a cabinet chair.\nThe debate was a struggle to win favor with the party’s base, and they all stepped over each other to use the word “free” more liberally. I didn’t hear how they would pay for the freebies, but (tee hee) is that silly old national debt really that important?\nWait a minute. Bernie Sanders did say he’d tax those greedy Wall Streeters until they shouted uncle, and that would provide the funds to do miracle things.\nThere was deafening silence on how they would create private sector jobs and grow the economy, other than Sanders saying he’d put people to work rebuilding roads and, likely, bridges. And Martin O’Malley said the war against global warming would employ legions to make us a clean energy nation.\nI thought the most sensible candidate on the stage was Jim Webb. He also was the most ignored by CNN’s Anderson Cooper. Unfortunately, Webb does not project well, and that rendered him a loser in the vocal strutting of others.\nSo, what do I think? Hillary was the winner. She kept her cool. She smiled more than the others. She demonstrated a knowledge of the issues, past and present. The woman’s no dummy. Cunning, too.\nAnother winner was the party. It reinforced its position with black, Hispanic, poor and delusional voters, something Republicans should be trying to do, but are just about pitching a shutout.\nI saw nothing last night to encourage Joe Biden to jump into race. Hillary didn’t do a pratfall.\nFENTON LUDTKE\nSavannah\nGet your facts straight, Mark Murphy\nI enjoyed reading the Oct. 11 feature by Mark Murphy about Coach Mark Richt (“The enigma of Mark Richt”) until I got to the paragraphs where he began listing other universities that were in the public eye for inappropriate behavior on their sports teams.\nHe went on to demean Penn State by bringing up the child molestation case years ago of Jerry Sandusky who actually was no longer on the coaching staff and had not been for many years when he committed the acts for which he was arrested and convicted.\nMr. Murphy also stated that at the time Coach Paterno was complicit in a cover-up. In fact, Coach Paterno, when told of the alleged molestation, brought this information to his higher-ups in command. Furthermore, Paterno has been recently exonerated, and his wins that were removed as a penalty have been reinstated.\nIn addition, the sanctions placed on the Penn State football team have been lifted. I hope in the future Mr. Murphy gets his facts straight before he tries to sensationalize with hot topic reporting.\nMARK PIVEN\nSavannah\nSenior income becoming stretched\nI was disappointed to learn that seniors will not be getting a cost of living increase next year even though their healthcare cost have increase by an average of 10 percent based on insurance plan data for 2016.\nInsurance executive’s bonuses and salaries have increased while seniors are told the reason for not getting a raise is lower gas prices. We all are familiar with the fact that gas prices change regularly. However, seniors’ budget is spent on healthcare, rising energy and food prices, and they have a fixed income to stretch.\nIt seems as though they are basing Social Security on gas and not expenses typically incurred by seniors and the disabled.\nTHE REV.
