They stayed undefeated for the week in a 3-and-2 victory over Rickie Fowler and Patrick Reed. \nSpieth and Dustin Johnson were 3 down at the turn to Jason Day and Charl Schwartzel and still two holes behind when Schwartzel came up short and into a creek with a wedge from the 14th fairway. It was the first of two big mistakes by Schwartzel. \nJohnson hit his tee shot to 7 feet on the par-3 17th, and Spieth poured in the putt to square the match. Both teams missed the fairway at 18, and Schwartzel tried to reach the green from a bunker. He missed it so badly that the ball barely left the ground, smacked into the base of the lip and stayed in the bunker. The International team made bogey. \nSpieth, however, played overly cautious with a wedge that left Johnson a 30-foot putt that was extremely fast at the hole, and he ran it 7 feet by. Spieth had to make that par putt for the win, and one of golf's best putters left little doubt.

And it was a huge point.\" LPGA Tour: South Korea's Ha Na Jang used a late three-hole birdie run to take a one-stroke lead in the LPGA Malaysia. The 23-year-old Jang shot a bogey-free 6-under 65 to reach 10-under 132 at Kuala Lumpur Golf and Country Club. Top-ranked Inbee Park (68), Alison Lee (69) and Yani Tseng (68) were another stroke back. Champions Tour: Bernhard Langer shot a 7-under 65 in windy conditions to take a two-stroke lead in the Champions Tour's SAS Championship. The 58-year-old German had seven birdies in a bogey-free round at Prestonwood Country Club in Cary, North Carolina. Langer is third in the Charles Schwab Cup points race, 388 points behind leader Colin Montgomerie and Jeff Maggert with four events left. Montgomerie was tied for 17th after a 70, and Maggert was tied for 36th after a 72.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:13:09.886+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
