((Jim Middlekauff | lehighvalleylive.com contributor)) \nWhen Wilson football coach Matt Senneca looks at junior defensive end/tight end Terrance Mainor , he sees a positive player. \nNot just in his play, which has been a major plus for the Warriors, who picked up their first win of the season last Friday with a 21-20 defeat of Catasauqua. \n“Terrance is the kind of kid who is never negative,” Senneca said. “He’s been a very vocal leader in all of our practices. He has a great attitude and always has a smile on his face. He can’t get enough football. I cannot say enough about the attitude he has brought to the team. We need more guys to be vocal like Terrance.” \nMainor was certainly vocal in celebrating the win over Catasauqua, and he and the Warriors (1-4) will be looking to make it two in a row when they host Palisades (2-3) Saturday at 1:30 p.m. \nWilson’s team liked how finally winning felt. \n“We’d worked every day hard for this and it felt really good to walk off that field with a win,” Mainor said. “We’d been eating bad food and Friday tasted a whole lot better. We were tired of losing and now we finally have a win.” \nThe win also made going to school each day more pleasant for Mainor, a Wilson Borough resident. \n“Now that we’ve won we don’t have to hear people on the hallways questioning us and being down on us,” he said. “They don’t believe in us and the team. That’s OK. We believe in it.” \nMainor said the team hopes to see a few more believers in the stands Saturday. \n“We would appreciate it if people were there; last week when we played (at Catasauqua) there were not a lot people at the game,” he said. “If not, we’ll do what we have to, and play hard, and they’re find out in school that we’ve won.” \nWilson won Friday with a combination of some big plays – a blocked punt, stopping Catty’s last-minute two-point conversion – and some pretty basic football. Mainor was part of an offensive line that cleared the way for 302 rushing yards in Friday’s monsoon-like conditions. \nIt may be raining again Saturday but it’s unlikely to be quite as drenching as the Catasauqua game. But Wilson took a lesson away from the win that was far more valuable than learning how to play in the rain. \n“Coach Senneca had been saying all season we if would play four quarters of football then we’d get a win and we finally did that Friday night,” Mainor said. “In other games like Northern Lehigh or Northwestern Lehigh we’d play a really good first half and then drop off in the second half. Friday we played well for the whole game and we got the win.” \nMainor said the win doesn’t just count in the standings in the win column on paper. It matters in the Warriors’ hearts. \n“We have a lot more confidence coming into Palisades on Saturday, knowing we have the ability to win,” Mainor said. “We can bring that into Palisades and the following weeks to come.” \nMainor has been bringing more power to each game this season after concentrating on beefing up in the offseason. \n“The main thing I took away from my sophomore year was that I was not physical enough,” Mainor said. “I really got in the weight room to work on my upper body, my legs, my overall strength. I wanted to have a more dominant season physically, and I can feel their difference in my strength from last year.” \nMainor also prepped for football season during the spring, “I’m on the track team as a jumper – high jump, triple jump, long jump,” he said. “I like it, but the main reason I do track is that it helps me with football.” \nAnd getting that good taste of victory going every week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:11:26.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
