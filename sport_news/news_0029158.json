The Mean Green desperately need to regroup now, just like five years ago.\nBack then, the Mean Green went on the road to face Western Kentucky and pulled through for a 33-6 win.\nUNT will look for a repeat Thursday -- once again against WKU.\nThat is where the similarities end. The Hilltoppers (5-1) are 3-0 in Conference USA play and feature one of the nation's top quarterbacks in Brandon Doughty.\nThat's a far different scenario than in Canales' first game in 2010, when the Mean Green rolled past a WKU team that was 1-6. This time, UNT (0-5, 0-2 C-USA) is a huge underdog coming off a short week to prepare after its coach was fired.\nCanales and his players vowed to rally in the face of those long odds.\n\"We have kids who truly believe they can win,\" Canales said. \"They want to win and prove some people wrong who are saying that our season is over. Our kids are prideful and will bounce back. They want to prove that they can still play football.\"\nFinding a way to contain opponents' passing attacks would be a good place to start. The Mean Green rank 126th out of 127 teams nationally in passing efficiency defense with a 190.85 rating, and they're one of eight FBS teams yet to intercept a pass.\nBreaking through against WKU and Doughty won't be easy. Doughty ranks second nationally with 2,359 passing yards, has thrown 20 touchdown passes with just three interceptions and is completing 74.7 percent of his passes.\n\"We have to approach it as another game against another good quarterback,\" UNT cornerback Zac Whitfield said. \"Doughty has experience at the position and moves in the pocket really well.\"\nDoughty has thrown for at least 400 yards four times and has at least four touchdown passes in each of his last three games. That doesn't bode well for the Mean Green, whose secondary has struggled.\nUNT lost starting cornerback Kenny Buyers to a back injury before the season. UNT's coaches convinced Whitfield to return for his final season of eligibility late in two-a-days after he had originally decided to walk away after graduating.\nWhitfield's return has done little to plug the holes in a secondary that will be tested tonight.\n\"We have to tighten up our coverage and get a good pass rush on him,\" UNT linebacker Calvin Minor said of Doughty. \"He's patient and has been there six years. He throws a good ball.\"\nTwitter: @brettvito\nOn Twitter:\n @brettvito", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/brettvito"], "published": "2015-10-15T05:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:24:50.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
