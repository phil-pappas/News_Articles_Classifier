Those ties were apparent early.\nJohn Mohlis, head of the state's building trades council, asked the candidates for a yes or no answer on whether they'd support one of his group's top priorities : the proposed Jordan Cove liqueified natural gas terminal at Coos Bay.\nThe project, decried by environmentalists who also hold influence with Democrats, is seen as a major fount of jobs for Oregon's recession-battered south coast. As a member of the State Lands Board, alongside the governor and state treasurer, whoever becomes secretary of state would have a say on its fate.\nAll three candidates said they'd keep out of its way and make sure the jobs it creates go to Oregon union members. But Hoyle went further, saying \"I support the project\" though that might mean she'll \"take heat.\"\n\"I will say that in this room. I will say it in rooms of people who oppose liquefied natural gas,\" she said, adding \"I'm not afraid to have an opinion. I hope when I have your back that you'll also have mine.\"\nThe candidates also agreed that officials pushing campaign finance reform — which the secretary of state would oversee as Oregon's top elections official — should distinguish between unions and corporations when proposing limits on contributions and spending.\nDevlin said Oregon's campaign system, with no caps on donations, has come to resemble \"the wild west.\" But he agreed unions should be treated differently because of how they raise money — often in small amounts from hundreds or thousands of members. Limits should apply to each member, he said.\n\"If a corporation has a $2,500 limitation,\" Devlin said, \"then there shouldn't be a $2,500 limit on a union. That is not campaign finance reform.\"\nAvakian, a former state lawmaker and labor lawyer, said he would fight to pinch off donations from out-of-state businesses.\n\"It's the billions of dollars of corporate money that is washing away our voices,\" he said, \"not the collective contributions of hardworking men and women just looking to have their say and fight the tide of that corporate influence.\"\nMost of the questions raised in the hourlong event emphasized the secretary of state's role overseeing elections.\nUnion delegates fretted over the rise of the Independent Party of Oregon, which qualified as a major political party this year for the first time. They won assurances that the candidates would fight efforts seen in other states to place restrictions on voting in the name of fighting fraud.\n\"That is 100 percent a specter put out by the right to make sure we don't have our voice,\" Hoyle said.\nDelegates also asked candidates how they'd grow turnout in the wake of legislation passed this year that will eventually make voter registration automatic — drawn from Department of Motor Vehicles records.\nAvakian and Hoyle both said they'd push for ballots to arrive with prepaid postage. Hoyle said ballots should be printed in whatever language a voter reads best.\nAvakian also challenged Oregon lawmakers to pass same-day voter registration, calling it a lifeline for Oregonians living in poverty or on the streets. Right now, Oregonians must be registered weeks before Election Day.\n\"This is about equality and access to the ballot,\" he said, \"and we need to make sure it's available equally to every voter in the state.\"\nThe candidates also used the debate to showcase their personal stories and clashing political styles — distinctions that may loom larger next year given their rough agreement on most policy issues.\nHoyle spoke of her blood ties to the labor movement in her closing statement, telling a story about her father braving violence to walk a picket line. She also reminded the room of worker-friendly legislation — such as statewide paid sick leave — that passed on her watch.\nAvakian, who won a straw poll of Oregon Democrats at the party's convention this month, highlighted his work atop the Bureau of Labor and Industries, winning wage-theft settlements and pushing other labor-friendly issues.\nDevlin, in contrast, went for big laughs in an opening statement that put a spin on his reputation as a cerebral, numbers-focused budget wonk. The longtime lawmaker and former Marine joked about being known as \"exciting, dynamic and charismatic.\"\n\"Everyone will tell you nobody can whip up a crowd like Richard Devlin,\" he said, his voice nearly deadpan. \"Well, perhaps not so much.\"\n— Denis C.
