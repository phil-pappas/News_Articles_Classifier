New York took a 2-1 lead into Game 4 Tuesday night at Citi Field. \nUtley was suspended two games for his rough slide in Game 2 that broke the leg of Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada. He was on the bench and didn't play in the Dodgers' 13-7 loss Monday night. \nJohn McHale Jr., the baseball executive who will hear the appeal, informed MLB and the players' union of the timing on Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:06:11.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
