Djokovic is making a claim By Talek Harris ,AFPOctober 20, 2015, 12:09 am TWN SHARE Tweet By Talek Harris \nSHANGHAI - Men's tennis has not been short of astonishing feats in recent years but Novak Djokovic is eclipsing even the great Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal as his record-breaking season reaches a crescendo. \nTwo titles in two weeks in China, including the Shanghai Masters, show there's no slowing down for the world No. 1, who has climbed above the competition this year and keeps rising higher. \nRecord points and prize money and three of the four Grand Slams, plus an aura of surreal calm, mark one of tennis's best ever seasons â€” and all emerging from the most unlikely of beginnings. \nSerbia was at war when Djokovic was a child in Belgrade, and he remembers dodging NATO bombing raids and practicing his tennis in a disused swimming pool. \nThose are experiences which he says keep him grounded as he methodically pieces together a career which could yet surpass anything seen in modern times. \nGluten-free Djokovic, who got married and became a father last year, says his current season is even better than 2011, when he also grabbed three Grand Slams and had a win-loss record of 70-6. \nUS$16 Million Man \n\"It's the best year of my life. No question about it. Everything is working great. I'm very grateful for the opportunity to be able to play this well, to be successful,\" he said in Shanghai. \nDjokovic has become only the third man, after Federer and Rod Laver, to reach all four Grand Slam finals in the same year and on current form, he has no consistent rivals to slow him down. \nHis points tally of 16,785, nearly double that of second-placed Murray, is a tour record, as is his prize money which is set to top US$16 million. \n\"Every time I step on the court, knowing I've had an amazing record this season and also in these tournaments in the previous years makes me play my best and makes me come out on the court with less doubts in my mind, I would say,\" Djokovic said. Just don't ask him how opponents can beat him. \"It's a good question, but I have no answer,\" smiled the Serb.
