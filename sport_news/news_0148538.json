The person spoke on condition of anonymity because no details were publicly released about the incident. \nFisher and Barnes were teammates with the Los Angeles Lakers from 2010-12. The Grizzlies wrapped training camp in Santa Barbara earlier last Saturday. \nMemphis acquired Barnes in a draft-day trade in June. Coach Dave Joerger told reporters Thursday that the Grizzlies support Barnes, and the veteran said the support of his new team feels good. \n\"I explained to them what happened, and they completely understand and had my back,\" Barnes said. \nFisher is in his second season with the Knicks after spending most of his playing career in Los Angeles, where his children remain. Fisher missed practice Monday — the team announced at the time it was for personal reasons — and led the Knicks in their exhibition opener Wednesday night against a Brazilian club team. \n___ \nAP Basketball Writer Brian Mahoney contributed to this report from New York.
