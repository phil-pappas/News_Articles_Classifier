As this month is Breast Cancer Awareness Month in the NFL, Williams has been at the the front of the campaign in encouraging everyone to wear pink to games.\nBut the NFL won't extend this support into November.\nWilliams adorned in pink including gloves boots and towel when playing for the Carolina Panthers in 2011. Photo: Scott Cunningham\nIn responding to a request from Williams to wear pink boots for the entire season, not just October, the NFL explicitly refused, citing their uniform rules.\nAdvertisement In a story told by Lisa Salters on CBS Sports, Williams said \"breast cancer awareness is not just about October for me, it's not just a month, it's a lifestyle. It's about getting women to recognise to get tested.\"\nWilliams has been vocal in his support for breast cancer since his mother fell ill, famously dying his hair pink last season.\nWilliams of the Pittsburgh Steelers in the first quarter against the New England Patriots in Massachusetts last month.

I love you. #WeAreInThisTogether https://t.co/bAwaanlfzV\n— DeAngelo Williams (@DeAngeloRB) October 11, 2015\nThe NFL goes totally pink for October, making pink accessories available to players and coaches and putting plenty of pink apparel on sale for fans to buy. They auction game-worn pink apparel, balls, and even coins, all theme for the month.\nBut it would seem that support ends the moment the clock strikes midnight on Halloween and William's pink boots will have to be shelved for another season.\nPredictably, social media was awash with outrage, with some comparing the NFL's refusal to let Williams wear pink to allowing Dallas Cowboys defensive end Greg Hardy to play, despite his domestic violence convictions.\nSo the @NFL won't let DeAngelo Williams wear pink to honor his mother who died of breast cancer, but Greg Hardy is allowed to play? Okay.\n— Spencer Checketts (@1280Spence) October 13, 2015\nSeriously, we should all be outraged that the NFL won't allow DeAngelo Williams to wear pink all season in honor of his mother/breast cancer\n— Taylor Rooks (@TaylorRooks) October 13, 2015\nit was really nice of the nfl to let deangelo williams wear pink in that commercial for the nfl.\n— Katie Nolan (@katienolan) October 13, 2015\nDeAngelo Williams: \"Can I wear pink to try to save lives?\" NFL:\"No\" Greg Hardy:\"I abuse women, what's up?\" NFL:\"Four games out, you're good\"\n— Colin Dunlap (@colin_dunlap) October 13, 2015\nLove story of DeAngelo Williams asking to honor mother by wearing pink all season, NFL like nah ...
