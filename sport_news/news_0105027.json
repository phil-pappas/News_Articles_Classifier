A forehand error in the seventh game pushed her further behind before Kerber sealed the opening set at 6-3.\nBut the 30-year-old Jankovic held firm, breaking three serves from her rival in the second set despite having the same number of her own broken, leading to a tense tie at 5-5.\nJankovic eventually prevailed in the tiebreak as her stressed 27-year-old rival began fighting fatigue in her attempts to deliver good serves.\nThe emboldened Jankovic went on to seal the game, and won six out of the seven games in the third set.\n\"I am lucky to win tonight... the third set was very much in my favour because her level dropped. She got really tired,\" Jankovic said.\nJankovic had edged past Williams, a seven-time Grand Slam winner, in a 7-5, 6-4 victory a day before, dimming the American's hopes of securing enough points to make it to the top eight for the WTA finals in Singapore.\nKerber would also have qualified for Singapore had she not lost to Jankovic, who was preparing to end her own season.\nShe said in the post-match press conference that she is still \"trying\" for Singapore for the rest of the season but it also depends on how a back issue plays out.\n\"I entered Moscow for the moment...let's see...how fast I can recover,\" she said.\nHaving won her second WTA title of the year, Jankovic, who suffered from injuries earlier in the year, said: \"I think I proved I can play at the top level.\"\n\"I just want to continue to work hard and believe in myself that I could do it... like in previous years.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:57:57.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
