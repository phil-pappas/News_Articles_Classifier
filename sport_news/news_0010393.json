Yet. \nThree games from Week 5 pushed me that much closer to desperation. They underscored the difficulty of picking NFL games against the spread. And not just \"best bets'' -- all games. \nI absolutely should have gone 9-5. Instead, I finished below .500. Yes, I am bitter. \nHere are the three that sting: \n• @ Kansas City -9 1/2 over Chicago. Chiefs led, 17-3, and had first-and-goal at the 9 early in the third quarter. On first down, running back Jamaal Charles injured his knee on a basic cut. On fourth down, the Bears blocked the field-goal attempt. Chiefs not only failed to cover, they lost, 18-17. \n• Seattle +3 over @ Cincinnati. Seahawks led, 24-7, and possessed the ball to begin the fourth quarter. NFL teams simply don't squander 17-point leads in the fourth quarter, but the two-time defending NFC champion Seahawks did. Bengals won, 27-24, in overtime. The push might as well have been a loss. \n• @ Oakland + 5 1/2 over Denver. Raiders trailed, 9-7, midway through the fourth quarter and had first-and-10 at the Denver 36. Two plays later, on third-and-5, quarterback Derek Carr threw a pick-6 at precisely the time the Blue Angels did a flyover at O.co Coliseum. Broncos, despite zero offensive TDs, won, 16-10. \nWeek 6 predictions: The lines, as will be the case all season, are from MGM Mirage via vegasinsider.com as of Wednesday afternoon unless noted (entertainment purposes only): \nThursday night \n@ New Orleans + 3 1/2 over Atlanta \nSkinny: Every fiber of my being wanted to go with the Falcons in a walk. I really like the Falcons and QB Matt Ryan, and I don't think much of the Saints. But the Saints are at home and Drew Brees is their QB, which are enough to keep it within a field goal. Falcons, 24-21. \nSunday \n@ Cleveland +4 over Denver \nSkinny: Browns QB Josh McCown is coming off a franchise-record 457 yards passing in an overtime victory at Baltimore. He has thrown for 300-plus in a franchise-best three straight games. But he is dealing with a gimpy left ankle, and the Broncos' defense is nasty. Gritty, gutty McCown manages to keep it close. Broncos, 23-21. \n@ Buffalo +3 1/2 over Cincinnati \nSkinny: Even if QB Tyrod Taylor were healthy, the Bills would be hard-pressed to beat the Bengals. Homefield and defense enable them to win ATS. Bengals, 19-16. \nKansas City +3 1/2 over @ Minnesota \nSkinny: I freely admit to being in denial about the Chiefs; I refuse to believe they are as bad as their record. They fall to 1-5 but manage to make it interesting. Vikings, 26-23. \n@ Jacksonville + 1 over Houston \nSkinny: This pick is more about being disgusted with the 1-4 Texans than being bullish on the 1-4 Jaguars. Texans lead in fourth quarter, only to fold. Jaguars, 20-17. \n@ Detroit -3 over Chicago \nSkinny: In a strictly bull-headed move, I am sticking with the Lions until they win ATS. Lions, 17-13. \n@ New York Jets -6 over Washington \nSkinny: Jets are legit, and it is time for the Redskins to get blown out. Jets, 27-10. \n@ Pittsburgh +3 over Arizona \nSkinny: Cardinals should win easily, primarily because their defense can daze and confuse Steelers QB Michael Vick. This is one of those games when the NFL doesn't make sense. Steelers, 24-21. \n@ Tennessee -2 1/2 over Miami \nSkinny: Dolphins continue to disappoint. Titans QB Marcus Mariota excels. Titans, 23-13. \n@ Seattle -7 over Carolina \nSkinny: Panthers fall to 4-1 because they happened to be the Seahawks' opponent, in Seattle, after the meltdown in Cincinnati. Seattle's defense resumes being stingy. Seahawks, 20-9. \n@ Green Bay -10 over San Diego \nSkinny: I wanted to go with the Chargers because of I am getting double-digit points, but I am tired of doubting that the Packers (5-0) can cover large spreads. Packers, 33-21. \n@ San Francisco +2 1/2 over Baltimore \nSkinny: 49ers, insulted they are considered underdogs, pile more dirt on the Ravens' season. 49ers, 20-16. \nSunday night \nNew England -7 over @ Indianapolis \nSkinny: Just another regular-season game for the Patriots. Yeah, OK. Patriots and Brady close with flourish to improve to 5-0. Patriots, 38-23. \nMonday night \n@ Philadelphia -4 over New York Giants \nSkinny: Eagles sustain momentum from thumping of New Orleans in Week 5. Eagles, 28-17.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:34:59.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
