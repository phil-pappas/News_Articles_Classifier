Jessica Trengove. Picture: Robert Cianflone (Getty Images)\nWARREN PARTLAND The Advertiser SOUTH Australia’s distance running star Jessica Trengove is to plot a course for the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games after all but cementing a trip to Brazil with an emphatic Melbourne Marathon victory on Sunday.\nThe world half marathon in Wales in March is an enticing option, while Trengove must decide whether to contest another marathon before the Rio Games in August.\nTrengove clocked a personal best 2hr27min45sec, the sixth fastest time ever by an Australian female.\nSecond on the list is another South Australian, Lisa Ondieki with 2:23.51.\nNow Trengove must decided how to build for Rio.\n“I had not planned a schedule beyond Melbourne,’’ Trengove said.\n“I wanted to tick that box and now we have to decide what is the best approach.\n“The option is to run another marathon in March or April or I could do a couple of half marathons and rely on tough training blocks.\n“After the Glasgow Commonweallth Games (third in the marathon last year) I had a chance to break up my program.\n“I focused on different distances and on the 10km. I ran a big PB on the track.’’\nTrengove has been based in Melbourne since January but will return to Adelaide to prepare for Rio.\nShe said she had pulled up well from the stunning Melbourne Marathon performance.\nHer calf muscles were “OK” although there was some tightness in the quads and a beach recovery session was on the agenda on Monday.\nAUSTRALIA’S FASTEST FEMALE MARATHONERS\n1.
