Comment   Sam Herder Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 10:58 AM By Sam Herder Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 10:58 AM By Sam Herder Journal Sports Every sports team takes the positives and negatives out of a game, whether it’s a win or a loss. In the last two weeks, the Devils Lake football team has had two losses, dropping its record to 3-3. The negatives are obvious. But one positive that definitely is keeping the Firebirds confident is the emergence of junior quarterback Jake Mertens, who’s continuing to get better. That leads us to Friday, where DL travels to Grand Forks Red River in what may be considered a quarterback battle. The Roughriders (1-5) and the Firebirds have the top two quarterbacks in terms of passing yards in the Eastern Dakota Conference. Derek Murph has thrown for 1,049 yards, 11 touchdowns and eight interceptions. Mertens has thrown for 705 yards, seven touchdowns and four interceptions. “Another good, quality EDC opponent,”Firebirds assistant coach Travis Thielges said. “They’re going to hit hard. They are fast and strong. A good quarterback who throws the ball well and will be hard to defend.” Thielges calls the offensive plays for DL, and he has seen Mertens make great strides in the last two weeks. Mertens has been a part of all 42 points in the last two games, whether it’s been through passing, running or 2-point conversions. “I’ve been reading the coverages better and recognizing the blitzes,” Mertens said. “My receivers have been getting a lot better and our timing is getting better.” Added Thielges, “He’s coming along. He’s learning who will be open where on coverages and what down. He throws such a nice ball and he has some good targets out there. Our passing game is definitely improving.” Coming off a tough 34-28 defeat last week at Fargo North, the Firebirds are on a 2-game losing streak after a 3-1 start. Things don’t get much easier in the EDC. Red River sports maybe the best quarterback-receiver duo in the conference. Murph has found his favorite target in Braedan Hanson. Hanson has 32 receptions for 342 yards and six touchdowns. Red River also has two other pass catchers with more than 165 yards and two touchdowns in Austin Slaughter and Baden Ripplinger. The Roughriders have gone through a gauntlet in their first six games with every opponent either being in the Top 5 polls at some point or receiving some votes. “1-5 for Red River is shocking to me, especially when you watch them on film,” Thielges said. “You can tell from their nonconference schedule and who they have played in conference that they have played some very tough teams. 1-5 is not a good predictor of the quality of football team we’re playing Friday night.” Page 2 of 2 - Devils Lake has three remaining games on its schedule. The last two come at home against the two teams from West Fargo. The Firebirds are looking to put everything together to get back into the win column. “We’ve been really focused this week,” Mertens said. “Losing that close one has motivated us to get to that next level that’ll take to win the close ones after that.” Kickoff on Friday is set for 7 p.m. for Devils Lake’s last regular season roadtrip “They’ve responded well,” Thielges said. “They’re practicing hard, correcting mistakes we made last week and getting better. That’s all we can ask for at this point. They understand that we need a win Friday night and they’re working hard for it.” By Sam Herder   Sam Herder", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:57:06.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
