Some of the happiest people in town are the spouses of employees. He made a lot of good people miserable.\"\nPatterson resigned Tuesday after 22 months on the job. According to the ESPN story, the final straw between Patterson and Texas was an exchange between him and a UT booster at a Longhorn foundation Advisory Council meeting on Sept. 11.\nThe booster asked about Rice's band not attending Saturday's game. Patterson explained the situation but the person wasn't content with the answer which caused an agitated exchange between the two.\n\"The story about the Rice band wasn't even true,\" a person at the meeting told ESPN. \"But people hated [Patterson] so much they wanted it to be true.\"\nJoe Jamail, a mega-booster whose name is on the Texas swimming facility and has the football field named after him, said Patterson's resignation wasn't a case of the boosters showing their power. He added that the speculation that he would help pay Patterson's buy out is false.\n\"I didn't have anything to do with hiring Steve, and I didn't have anything to do with firing him,\" Jamail told ESPN.\nClick here to read the full ESPN story.\nOn Twitter:\n @Nick_Castillo74", "external_links": ["http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/13683231/the-steve-patterson-era-texas-just-put-us-hell", "https://twitter.com/Nick_Castillo74"], "published": "2015-09-19T03:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:48:19.379+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
