Comment Posted Oct. 19, 2015 at 3:46 AM Updated at 3:50 AM Posted Oct. 19, 2015 at 3:46 AM Updated at 3:50 AM WALTHAM – The team he left was in eighth place in the competitive Western Conference, four games above the .500 mark. The team he joined was in a rebuilding mode, sitting 11 games below the break-even point in 10th place in the weaker Eastern Conference. At first glance, Isaiah Thomas wasn’t exactly thrilled with being traded from the Phoenix Suns to the Celtics last Feb. 19. “I was disappointed at first,’’ said Thomas before a Sunday afternoon practice. “I had never been traded. Then, I didn’t really watch the Celtics, so I thought they were at the bottom of the Eastern Conference. “I’m like, I go from a playoff contending team to a team that’s kind of rebuilding.’’ Then Thomas took a look at the standings and saw that the Celtics, even with a 20-31 record at the time, sat only a game-and-a-half out of the final playoff spot in the East. “Once I figured out they were just a game-and-a-half out of the playoffs,’’ said Thomas, “it was like, that felt a lot better.’’ Things got a lot better with Thomas on board as he helped spark a late-season surge that allowed the Celtics to finish 40-42 and earn the No. 7 seed in the Eastern Conference. The Suns, who were 29-25 the day of the trade with the Celtics, wound up 39-43 and did not make the postseason. Thomas, a 5-foot-9 guard, averaged 19 points in 26 minutes off the Celtics’ bench, appearing in 21 games and finishing second to Lou Williams in the voting for the NBA’s Sixth Man Award. The Celtics and Thomas proved to be a perfect match, and he was an instant hit with the fans during the season’s final two months. “It was nice,’’ said Thomas. “This team, this organization made me as comfortable as possible. My job is really to go out there and be myself, and they like me for that. “It was amazing, the fans. It was a blessing. These fans are one of the best fan bases in the world. For them to love me and bring me in with open arms was a great feeling.’’ The 26-year-old Thomas, who was acquired for a 2016 first-round pick and Marcus Thornton, was able to make a quick transition to the Celtics and became their offensive leader with an aggressive approach. “I really thought he’d really impact our team,’’ said coach Brad Stevens. “I thought his ability to get in the paint would be like a shot in the arm for our team. Page 2 of 2 - “From an efficiency standpoint at the offensive end of the floor, both at the end of last year and through the first four preseason games, he’s just playing at such a high level. He’s such a good fit. My expectations were high, but I think he’s probably topped those.’’ Thomas, the 60th pick in the 2011 draft by the Sacramento Kings, averaged 15.2 points with the Suns last season after signing a four-year, $27 million contract. The Suns’ backcourt was crowded, though, so Thomas was dealt to the Celtics and now he’s getting a full training camp to prepare for the season that opens a week from Wednesday night. “It’s really nice,’’ said Thomas, who averaged 20.3 points in his third and final season with the Kings. “It makes it a little more comfortable. It’s tough when you come to a new team in the middle of the season. Everything they’re doing, they’ve been doing the whole year and you don’t know anything that they’re doing. “When I got in the game last year, it was like, space the floor and pick-and-roll. I didn’t really get any practices in, especially when I got hurt (a back injury on March 9). Having a full training camp is only going to help.’’ The Celtics figure to rely on Thomas even more this season, even with teams paying closer to attention to him. “He’s played really well in the preseason,’’ said Stevens. “You look at just his stats. He’s shooting great from the field, making a lot of the right plays. Teams are starting to guard him different ways, which is good for him to see. “I feel really comfortable with how he’s playing heading into the regular season.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:25:08.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
