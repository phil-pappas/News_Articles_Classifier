Richardson is thrilled about the moves. \n“It goes a long way,” he said. “Surrounding (the young guys) with a good support group, it is huge. It’s kind of what we’ve been hoping for. Ottawa’s management came through in a big way. I think we just have to jell together the best way we can.” \nThe two most prized rookie skaters this season are forwards Nick Paul and Tobias Lindberg. The pair of 20-year-olds were selected back-to-back in the fourth round of the 2013 National Hockey League draft and were proven goal scorers at the junior level. Paul tied for 13th in the Ontario Hockey League in goals last season with 37 in 58 games. He also added 29 assists and 49 penalty minutes for the North Bay Battalion. \n“Always nerves, especially when you’re playing on this level just starting out being one of the youngest on the team, and the league,” Paul said of the transition from juniors to the AHL. “You have to make your nerves good instead of bad. Instead of overthinking plays you just have to put it toward working harder and not making as many mistakes.” \nLindberg was 20th overall in the OHL in scoring with 78 points (32 goals, 46 assists) in 67 games for the Oshawa Generals last season. He also scored the winning goal to help the Generals claim the prestigious Memorial Cup. Lindberg said he had a lot of fun at camp, he thought he showed the coaches that he can play at the NHL level and he hopes to get a chance to play there at some point this season. \nHe is also excited about playing for Richardson. \n“I know that he has had a long career in the NHL before so he really knows what he is talking about,” Lindberg said. “He’s a calm guy who works on a lot of details so I think we’re going to have a great season with him as the head coach.” Buy Photo \nB-Sens forward Buddy Robinson talks to the media on Wednesday. (Photo: Matt Weinstein / staff photo) \nOnly 11 of the 26 players on the current B-Sens roster began the 2014-15 season in Binghamton: defensemen Fredrik Claesson, Patrick Mullen and Mike Sdao; forwards Buddy Robinson, Matt Puempel (sent down from Ottawa on Wednesday), Cole Schneider, Max McCormick, Alex Guptill, Ryan Dzingel and David Dziurzynski; and goalie Scott Greenham. Six players appeared for the B-Sens at some point during last season: defensemen Guillaume Lepine and Nick Tuzzolino; forwards Danny Hobbs, Colin Greening and Alex Wideman; and goalie Chris Driedger. \nFour of the new faces have played at least 40 National Hockey League games and 180 American Hockey League games in their careers: forwards Zack Stortini and Eric O’Dell, and defensemen Mark Fraser and Mike Kostka. \n“We are very eager to get going,” Richardson said. “Guys who have been here a few years like Schneider and (Dziurzynski) showing a lot of effort out here practicing and that goes a long way to really push the young guys and the new guys; it helps them out a lot. \n“There’s always disappointment from being sent down from the big camp but they’ve seemed to, being around here a few years, they know how to deal with it, they get over it and the young guys see that. Great leadership by example.” Buy Photo \nB-Sens forward Nick Paul talks to the media on Wednesday. (Photo: Matt Weinstein / staff photo) \nO’Dell, who averages slightly less than one point per game over 138 AHL contests, should help replace the production of Shane Prince, who led Binghamton in scoring last season with 65 points. The 25-year-old said this will be his first time living in the United States. He is an Ottawa native who played junior hockey in Sudbury, Ontario, and came from the Winnipeg Jets organization, whose AHL affiliate is St. John’s, Newfoundland. \nStortini, an enforcer who always seems to be smiling, will be paired with Dziurzynski and Max McCormick to start the season. \n“It’s great to be on this side,” Stortini said. “It’s an awesome fanbase here. It’s always a great rink to play in, lots of energy, lots of excitement and happy to be a part of that in the Senators organization.” \nFraser will bring a hard-hitting presence similar to B-Sens fan favorite Mark Borowiecki and Kostka is an offensive defenseman who should help out on the power play. \nGreening brings more leadership after being sent down last week. He will make $2.65 million this season and is signed through 2016-17. Although disappointed with no being in the NHL, he will be happy to be playing every night. \n“I don’t think I was going to play up in Ottawa and for me that’s the most important thing,” the 29-year-old said. “I need to keep being the player I’ve always been. I think it’s a matter of confidence. When you’re playing with a lot of confidence, things kind of just seem to happen. I’m hoping to have that while I’m here. Whether that happens or not is soon to be told but I’ll certainly be trying.” \nHOCKEY NIGHT \nWHO: Albany Devils at Binghamton Senators \nWHEN: 7:05 p.m./Saturday \nWHERE: Floyd L.
