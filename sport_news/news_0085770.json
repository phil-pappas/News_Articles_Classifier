The Belgian had defeated Ana Ivanovic and Barbora Strycova en route to the semifinals. \n\"I will try to just focus my tennis and not think about the fact that it's a final,\" said Doi, who ended a four-match losing streak with a hard-fought victory over fourth-seeded Andrea Petkovic in her opening round. \n\"I'd lost a little bit of confidence, but then I played Petkovic, and I was feeling good after that,\" she said. \nBarthel converted four of five break points to breeze past wild-card entry Stefanie Voegele 6-2, 6-3 in the other semifinal. She will be bidding for a fourth career title in Sunday's final. \n\"It was a really good match,\" Barthel said. \"I didn't expect it would go that well for me, but I'm happy with the way I played. I think I played really solid and aggressive, but didn't make a lot of mistakes.\" \nDoi upset former top-ranked player Jelena Jankovic in the quarterfinals. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:45:40.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
