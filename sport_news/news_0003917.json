HILLSDALE — Remember, you can’t spell tough without an O and a T.\nWith a dominant performance up front, NV/Old Tappan stamped itself as North Jersey’s best public school team, slamming Pascack Valley, 42-14, Friday night.\nThe Golden Knights (6-0) were impressive in many areas. Yes, senior superstar Jordan Fuller did a lot. He threw for two scores, rushed for another and ran back an interception 49 yards for a fourth. But he had a ton of help. Running back Zach DeNike had 119 yards on the ground, a touchdown catch and an interception of his own. Kevin Martinez threw a TD pass to Jedh Downey.\nBut the best thing for the Golden Knights was they out-toughed a team that is traditionally regarded as the most physical in North Jersey.\n“We kept pushing the whole game,” said Old Tappan senior lineman Stephen Piccinich. “We are not soft. Their whole Valley tough thing, it’s a bunch of baloney.”\n“We challenged every kid on the team to raise their level to try to meet how they play,” said NV/OT coach Brian Dunn. “They play such a solid game of football, two backs and tight end, and we hadn’t played a team like that through five games, so you have to be ready for their physicality.”\nEn route to their second straight sectional title, Valley beat NV/Old Tappan, 37-14, in the North 1, Group 4 semifinals in 2014. Friday, NV/OT looked ready for payback from the opening whistle, owning the line of scrimmage, out-rushing the Indians, 169-80.\nThese two teams are no longer in the same section. The Indians have dropped to North 1, Group 3. So this was going to be the only meeting this season between the rivals, ranked first and second in The Record public Top 20.\nAnd it basically boiled down to this. The Indians couldn’t stop the Golden Knights. NV/Old Tappan scored on its first two possessions, driving 55 yards and 47 yards. Then Fuller ran back an interception 49 yards to make it 21-7 early in the second quarter.\nThe next time the Golden Knights got the ball, Piccinich waved to the Pascack Valley crowd.\n“They kept celebrating and we were beating them,” Piccinich said. “We were doing everything right, but they kept talking over there. I just took that and used it to pump myself up.”\nDunn must get credit for the way his offense is constructed. It has to be tempting to put Fuller back in the Wildcat and just snap it to him and let him run 40 times. But the Golden Knights are a lot more than a one-man band.\n“Jordan is a dangerous athlete and when you have other weapons around him, you just don’t know what is going to happen,” said DeNike.\nPlaying multiple positions, DeNike had a huge game. In the fourth quarter, he touched the ball on seven straight plays as the Golden Knights sealed it. He showed good speed to the outside and also good hands as a receiver.\n“Going against those guys, they aren’t giving you anything, so whatever you get, you have to work for,” said Dunn. “That’s what I’m most proud of. You have to work hard for every play, every yard and every first down. Our guys take a lot of pride in that.”\nIt was the biggest loss for Valley since a 42-3 defeat to St. Joseph in 2011, but it doesn’t diminish the Indians’ title hopes at all. Valley (5-1) has a big showdown looming with Ramapo in two weeks, and it will be fascinating to see how the Indians’ ground game matches up with the Green Raiders’ air assault.\nFor the Golden Knights, they now have three winnable games left in the regular season before the North 1, Group 4 playoffs begin. The playoffs have never been kind to the Golden Knights, who have only one sectional title in school history. Most recently, the school lost two heartbreakers to Wayne Hills in the 2010 and 2011 sectional finals.\nDunn said the Golden Knights’ biggest challenge is their next one, when they face Northern Highlands. He wasn’t interested in looking too far down the road. But no one can say the Golden Knights aren’t tough any more. They proved it Friday.\n“There’s no question they were a lot tougher than us last year, it wasn’t a mystery,” said Dunn. “That’s why they beat us up. This year, we got the better of it. Next year, we will strap up and go at it again.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:54:39.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
