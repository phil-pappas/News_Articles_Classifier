Please, come forward.”\nAnyone with information about the incident should contact the Washington State Patrol.\ncomment (4)", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T23:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:17:00.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
