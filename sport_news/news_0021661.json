This matchup also marks the 30th anniversary of the only playoff confrontation between these two teams: the 1985 ALCS. Against a Blue Jays team making its first-ever postseason appearance, the Royals won the pennant in dramatic fashion, rallying from 0–2 and 1–3 deficits to win the final three games, including Games 6 and 7 in Toronto’s jerry-rigged Exhibition Stadium, en route to their first World Series title.\nToronto eventually reached the World Series in 1992 and won it in both that year and in '93, but the Jays haven’t been back since. The Royals, meanwhile, haven’t won a championship since 1985. Kansas City is obviously hoping history will repeat itself this year. But in facing a Toronto team that just snapped a 21-year playoff drought, the Royals, who snapped a 29-year drought of their own last year, find themselves in the odd position of not being the underdogs for a change. After all, the Royals are the defending AL champions and the top seed in the league this October, a status which gives them home field advantage for this series.\nIn truth, these teams are very evenly matched. Yet despite the fact that they both play outstanding defense and both acquired a rotation ace in late July, they are quite different in their construction.\nYour browser does not support iframes.\nOffense The Blue Jays had the best offense in baseball this year, and it wasn’t close. They scored 5.5 runs per game; the runner-up scored 4.7. They posted a team OPS+ (which corrects for their offense-friendly home ballpark) of 118; no other team’s was above 106. They also led the majors in home runs (232), doubles (308), walks (570), on-base percentage (.340) and slugging (.457). But despite all of the power in that lineup, Toronto ranked 24th in strikeouts. It’s not often you see a contact-oriented team lead the majors in home runs and walks. In fact, the last two teams to lead the majors in home runs and walks and finish in the bottom ten in strikeouts were the 2009 Yankees and 1987 Tigers .\nThis year’s Blue Jays also led the majors in stolen-base percentage, swiping 88 bags at a 79% success rate, led by centerfielder Kevin Pillar ’s 25 in 29 attempts and despite speedy leftfielder Ben Revere not joining the team until August. There is nothing Toronto didn’t do well at the plate or on the bases this season, and the team only got better after the trading deadline: The Jays have averaged 6.1 runs per game from Aug. 1 through Game 5 of the ALDS.\nMLB Video Jays complete ALDS comeback against Rangers behind wild seventh by Emma Span", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/cliffcorcoran"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:04:40.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
