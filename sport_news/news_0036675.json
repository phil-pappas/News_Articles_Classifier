East Stroudsburg University played at Kutztown University in college football Saturday. KUTZTOWN DONNA FISHER/THE MORNING CALL Pic made SATURDAY, OCTOBER 26, 2013 (DONNA FISHER / THE MORNING CALL) Tom Housenick Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call ESU's record-setting Schnaars, Soltes all about friendship, winning \nJon Schnaars and Matt Soltes accepted an invitation by two upperclassmen in the late summer of 2011 to engage in a swimming pool wrestling match. \nNot the most intelligent decision, but boys will be boys. \n\"We had to friend up quick because they were big dudes,\" Schnaars said. \"I think we did pretty well.\" \nNow fifth-year seniors for coach Denny Douds' East Stroudsburg football program, Schnaars and Soltes are doing ridiculously well, proving they are men among boys. \nThe wide receiver and quarterback, respectively, are exceptionally talented, but what has allowed them to put up record-setting numbers is something that has nothing to do with football. \nThey are best friends. \n\"He is sarcastic like me,\" Soltes said. \"He loves football. He knows when to lighten up the mood and when to be serious. \n\"We're almost the same person.\" \nIt shows on the field. Schnaars set ESU records for receptions (20) and receiving TDs (7) in a game earlier this month against Shippensburg. Soltes established a school mark for completions (40) in a game and tied another with nine TD passes against the Red Raiders. \nThey are reaching legendary status as their accomplishments climb the school, PSAC and Division II charts and they lead the nation in several categories. \n\"It's nice seeing everything written up there, but we're not thinking about it out there on the field,\" Schnaars said. \"It's just fun. I love football, love scoring with my teammates.\" \nMost of all, they would trade the individual achievements for four victories to close out the regular season. It would assure the Warriors likely would be PSAC champions. \nFive years ago, Soltes and Schnaars weren't even on the ESU depth chart. They were redshirt freshmen playing on the scout team every day in practice. \nRedshirting was a blow to their egos after being high school studs. \nDaily workouts showed they needed a year to grow, but it also put their determination and work ethic on display. \n\"[The first-team defense] used to beat up on us every day,\" Schnaars said, \"so we got sick of it and made up our own routes. \n\"The coaches didn't like it, but we got completions and made the team better.\" \nSoltes got a chance to start four games into his redshirt freshman season. The quarterback hasn't looked back. He is 200 yards away from becoming the fifth player in Division II history with at least 3,000 total yards in all four seasons. \nSchnaars eased into playing time as a redshirt freshman with 16 catches. He is 134 receiving yards away from 3,000 for his career. \nBoth were on their way to monster seasons in 2014 as juniors. Then, Schnaars reached the low point in his college career when his closest friend suffered a season-ending shoulder injury in the third quarter of the Kutztown game. \n\"The kid doesn't show pain,\" Schnaars said. \"But when he went down, you could see right away that it wasn't something minor. \n\"It was a big shock. It was Homecoming. We are wearing the black jerseys. It went from a high point to a low. \n\"The low point wasn't me getting hurt,\" Soltes said. \"It was not being able to play for them. That was my first thought. I let them down.\" \nESU lost that game and the next three to finish a once promising season at 6-5. \nThe Warriors struggled in their first two games this season as Soltes tried to regain his form, all while taking a beating. But there was little doubt he would return. \n\"For those 60 minutes there to play the game,\" Douds said, \"he's going to do everything in his power. \n\"He's going to be the first guy up the hill with the flag. He's a pure leader.\" \nSince then, the only loss came in the game most want to talk about — a 69-67, 5-overtime setback to Shippensburg. \nThe individual statistics of Schnaars and Soltes were tremendous, but something was missing. \n\"The first thing I noticed was that we just lost that game,\" Soltes said. \"I get mad when people say that you had a great game. \n\"But it is crazy what we're doing here, to know what the quarterbacks and receivers did here in the past. It's cool to be up there in their league.\" \nFew thought anyone would be mentioned in the same breath as current ESU assistant Jimmy Terwilliger, a Harlon Hill winner as Division II's best player and is the PSAC's all-time leader in total offense, passing yards and touchdown passes. \nSoltes is on pace to be second in each of those categories. Schnaars already is second on ESU's list of receptions and TD passes. \nThey have done it together almost since the first day of preseason workouts in 2011 on the field — and in the Koehler Fieldhouse pool. \nThey want to continue playing football after college before real life calls. \n\"We never want to let it go,\" Soltes said. \"Somehow, it will be some place in our lives.\" \nAnd they expect their friendship to last a lifetime. \nWhen Soltes becomes a high school football coach and Schnaars is a lawyer, they will joke with each other about Schnaars liking Backstreet Boys music and Soltes enjoying the TV show \"Teen Wolf.\" \nIt will be just like college.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:24:19.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
