But they also needed to win with certain conditions. \nThe 49ers needed to win Sunday with no collateral damage to their confidence by, say, eking out a lucky win despite a bad game plan or inconsistent playmaking. They needed a victory that demonstrated how the coaches could buck up the players after four straight losses with some good strategic concepts -- and that the players could execute those concepts. \nDone and accomplished, 25-20 over the Baltimore Ravens. \n\"We're measured by wins and losses,\" said 49ers coach Jim Tomsula, sticking with the clich√©s during his postgame news conference. \"So getting one in the left hand column is very important. Every time you win, it's a really good thing.\" \nJust to be clear: There is still no conclusive proof that Tomsula can be a long-term winning coach in the NFL. But we saw signs Sunday that he is more than just a beefy guy on the sideline lending encouragement to his employees. Tomsula and his top assistants -- offensive coordinator Geep Chrys and defensive coordinator Eric Mangini -- came to work with tactics that the players bought into and implemented. Advertisement \nYou could see that on the 49ers' first drive. It is part of quarterback Colin Kaepernick's permanent record that he usually struggles if he does not get off to a good start. It is also a fresh memory that in the 49ers' last home game, against Green Bay earlier this month, wide receivers Torrey Smith and Anquan Boldin showed visible signs of peeved frustration when Kaepernick was not getting the ball to them. \nSo what happened Sunday? On two of 49ers' first three plays, Chryst ordered up quick, short throws to Boldin and Smith near the line of scrimmage. Boldin grabbed his ball, reversed his field and gained 15 yards after the catch. Smith snatched his ball and went down after just two yards. \nNothing spectacular. But Kapernick immediately felt a rhythm. The two receivers immediately felt a part of that rhythm. \n\"Early on,\" Boldin confirmed, \"we wanted to get the ball out of Kap's hands, just let guys have one-on-one situations where we can make plays . . . Had some things we saw on film that we wanted to attack. We were able to do that.\" \nTwo first-quarter drives yielded two 49er field goals. But the first big attack-plan payoff occurred early in the second quarter. Smith lined up against man-to-man coverage from Baltimore cornerback Shareece Wright. Just eight days earlier, Wright had been on the 49ers roster. He'd joined them a free agent last spring but was not made active for the season's first four games. Wright had expressed Twitter discontent about this. So the 49ers cut him. The Ravens picked him up last Tuesday. \nLet's just say that the 49ers were prepared to face Wright as a Raven. Eager to face him, actually. \n\"I think being around any player, you pick up on their tendencies,\" Kaepernick said. \"You pick up on what you can take advantage of . . . and we did.\" \nOne of Reese's weaknesses, as it turns out, is being far too aggressive in trying to jump pass patterns against opposing receivers. So when Smith took off from the line of scrimmage line and did a little stutter step about 10 yards downfield, as if preparing to cut right or left, Wright bit. Smith blew totally by him and was wide open, 40 yards downfield. \nKaepernick, in rhythm, sent the ball soaring with perfect timing into Smith's hands. He easily sprinted the 36 remaining yards to the end zone for a 76-yard touchdown. The 49ers led on the scoreboard, 13-3. \n\"We knew we were going to take some shots,\" Smith said. \"We haven't really been able to take as many as we would have liked . . . If it's on me, I'm going to tell them to call it the first play of the game. But we knew it was coming. Geep was dialing it up.\" \nLater, Wright was victimized again. Quinton Patton, the 49ers' wideout, busted a move and caused Wright to slip and fall on a 21-yard touchdown pass from Kaepernick. \n\"I think we ran a couple of double moves at him,\" said 49ers cornerback Kenneth Acker, empathizing with his former teammate. \"That sucks for him. Good coaching, though.\" \nThere was also some good stuff for the 49ers' defense, presumably crafted by Mangini. Baltimore quarterback Joe Flacco was flummoxed through most of the game by the 49ers' coverages, at one point throwing an interception directly to Acker. Flacco rallied to make things close in the final five minutes. But the 49ers defense played its keys and held, right down to the Hail-Mary pass deflection on the game's last play. \nMinutes before that, though, there was another solid coaching move from Tomsula. As the 49ers worked down the clock on their own last offensive drive, Patton made a diving catch for a first down -- but it seemed questionable whether he stayed in bounds or got his hands totally under the ball. Tomsula screamed from the sideline for Kaepernick to get under the ball quickly and run a play before the Ravens challenged it. Kaepernick did. A little thing. But noteworthy. \nAnd whatever comes next, in just a few more days, will be even more noteworthy. It's doubtful that when the NFL scheduled a prime-time game between the 49ers and Seahawks that anyone figured we'd be looking at a matchup of 2-4 teams. But here we are. And with what we saw Sunday, the mismatch between Seattle coach Pete Carroll's staff and Tomsula's staff may not be as overwhelming as perceived. \nSuddenly, this Thursday's kickoff becomes a lot more interesting.
