Back | Next SUBMITTED After suffering season-ending collarbone injuries in back-to-back seasons, Emporia State quarterback Brent Wilson was unsure whether he would even return for his senior season. However, Wilson did return and is 1,891 yards away from breaking the Hornets' career mark for passing yards. richard.peterson@cjonline.com \nGarin Higgins remembers the skepticism. \nTasked with replacing record-breaking quarterback Tyler Eckenrode, the Emporia State coach was often quizzed about his next choice for quarterback heading into the 2013 season. \nInternally, the ESU staff had no reservations about handing the reins to Brent Wilson, but Higgins could sense the uncertainty around town. \nConcerns about Wilson could be traced back to a road game at Southwest Baptist in 2012, when the true freshman got his first real chance to make a strong impression on the field. \nCalled upon after an injury to Eckenrode, Wilson failed to complete any of his four pass attempts and was intercepted twice. \n“Needless to say, after Tyler Eckenrode graduated, everybody began to question about who was going to be the starting quarterback next year,” Higgins said. “Whenever I would say, ‘I’ve got him, it’s going to be Brent Wilson,’ people remembered what he did against Southwest Baptist. They really looked at me kind of cockeyed. Like, ‘Man, coach is kind of crazy.’” \nIt didn’t take long for Wilson to erase any doubts, torching MIAA defenses for 2,985 yards through the air and 33 touchdowns while leading ESU to a 9-2 season and a playoff appearance in 2013. But it wouldn’t be the last time Wilson would have to prove himself. \nIn fact, there was a fleeting moment when Wilson was unsure if playing his senior season would be worth it after suffering the same season-ending injury in back-to-back seasons. \nDriven by his faith, Wilson wasn’t ready to call it a career, re-emerging to lead the No. 18 Hornets to a 5-0 start this season. \nMeanwhile, records are continuing to shatter. \nDIAMOND IN THE ROUGH \nWilson had two major hurdles to clear at Ponca City (Okla.) high school when it came to attracting the attention of college coaches. \nFirst, Ponca City struggled to compete in Class 6A in Oklahoma, managing just two wins during Wilson’s senior season. \n“Going through that tough situation in high school — not winning very many games — it definitely motivated me to find a place where I could see myself winning,” Wilson said. \nEven without an abundance of talent around him, Wilson finished his high school career with 6,167 passing yards and 61 touchdowns. \nBut Wilson was also undersized, listed at 6-foot and around 180 pounds. \n“Everyone, I think, wants to maybe be faster or stronger and bigger and things like that, but I was blessed to be able to play the quarterback position even though I’m about 5-11,” Wilson said. “I just needed one school to take a shot on me and give me an opportunity to show my abilities that God has given me.” \nLooking to catch someone’s eye, Wilson attended a skills camp at Emporia State in the summer before his senior season. \n“I was able to come to the camp and present myself, I guess, well enough to give myself an opportunity to come play football here,” Wilson said. \nJudging by Higgins’ account of the camp, Wilson is being modest, which isn’t out of the ordinary. \n“He made every throw,” Higgins said. “I don’t know if he threw an incompletion. I walked off our game field that day after that camp and said, ‘Look, that’s the best quarterback I’ve seen.’” \nBURSTING ON THE SCENE \nAs a freshman, Wilson experienced a taste of ESU’s breakthrough season under Higgins, with the Hornets finishing 10-2 and winning the Kanza Bowl in 2012. \nHe played sparingly as a backup while learning the ropes under Eckenrode. \n“Learning from Tyler Eckenrode, one of the greatest quarterbacks to come through Emporia State, definitely helped me,” Wilson said. “When I was able to get in at different times during the year, I made plenty of mistakes, and I grew from those and learned from those. I think that really propelled me to be ready for my sophomore year to compete for a starting job.” \nAfter winning the starting job, Wilson delivered the best first start by a quarterback in ESU history, throwing for 301 yards and three touchdowns in the Hornets’ 43-13 victory against Fort Hays State. \nWilson continued to put up eye-popping numbers. \n“I had people tell me, ‘Coach, I just didn’t realize how good he was,’” Higgins said. \nBehind Wilson, Emporia State earned its first playoff berth since 2003 with a 34-23 victory over Washburn in the regular-season finale. \nUnfortunately, Wilson didn’t get the chance to experience the playoffs. He was sidelined for Emporia State’s first-round 55-13 loss at Minnesota Duluth after suffering a broken collarbone in the Washburn game. \nAt the time, the injury seemed like a once-in-a-career kind of setback. \nBut less than a year later, Wilson was hit with the worst kind of déjà vu. \nKEEPING THE FAITH \nDespite Emporia State’s 1-2 start to the 2014 season, Wilson continued to put up gaudy numbers, throwing for 988 yards entering the Hornets’ fourth game of the season at Northeastern State. \nLocked into a tight game with NSU, Wilson hurt his shoulder at some point in the fourth quarter. He played through the pain, eventually running for the game-winning touchdown in the second overtime. \nHowever, X-rays confirmed the worst-case scenario: Wilson broke his collarbone for a second time. \nFrom there, Wilson relied on his faith for direction. \n“You have a different outlook on life when you do have faith and Jesus to lean on,” Wilson said. “It just gives you a sense of peace, because God is control. Just knowing that comforted me during those hard times. Knowing that He has a plan for me just really allowed me to continue to fight on and continue to strive to get better each day.” \nAfter a smooth recovery, Wilson regained his form as one of the most lethal quarterbacks in the nation. \nHis first five games of the season featured passing yardage totals of 330, 446, 316, 285 (in one half) and 386 for a league-high total of 1,763 yards. He also ranks first in the conference in touchdown passes with 17. \n“I knew that he would do everything that he needed to do to come back from it,” Higgins said. “He knows that God has a plan for him. That helps him from not worrying about situations such as his collarbone.” \nLEGACY \nAsk Higgins or ESU’s talented group of receivers what stands out about Wilson on the field, and his poise is one of the first things brought up. \n“He stays calm the whole time, at least he looks like it from the outside,” ESU receiver Mitchell Foote said. “He’ll never allow his teammates to think he’s in a situation he can’t handle. He definitely does a great job of stepping up to the plate and delivering for our team.” \n“He never gets really rattled,” Higgins added. “If he does, you never see it. He is very even-keeled, which is good, because I’m very passionate, very high-energy. Probably get upset at times maybe when I don’t need to. Just typical head coach stuff. \n“He really does a good job of helping me stay grounded, to be quite honest with you, just because of his attitude and how even-keeled he is.” \nEntering the Hornets’ game against No. 13 Pittsburg State at 2 p.m. Saturday at Welch Stadium, Wilson leads the nation in completions per game (29.20) and ranks in the top 10 in six other categories. \nWilson, already holding a handful of single-game and season records for the Hornets, broke Emporia State’s career passing touchdown record last week at Lindenwood, bringing his total to 61. He’s 1,891 yards away from Eckenrode’s career passing yardage record of 8,031 yards. \n“(Breaking records) is great and all, but my main focus is Pittsburg State on Saturday,” Wilson said. “If we continue to get the wins, all those other things will take care of itself. I’d rather leave a legacy where our team did so well. As long as we keep winning, that’s the most important thing.” \nRick Jr. Peterson can be reached at (785) 295-1290 or rick.peterson.jr@cjonline.com .Follow Rick Jr. on Twitter @RickiePeterson .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:58:28.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
