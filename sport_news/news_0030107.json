(AP Photo/Richard Shiro) more > By GEORGE HENRY - Associated Press - Monday, October 12, 2015 \nATLANTA (AP) - It’s gotten so bad for Georgia Tech that coach Paul Johnson can no longer count on his beloved spread option offense to run basic plays. \nWith the Yellow Jackets struggling as much as they in his eight-season tenure, Johnson huddled the team together Monday to discuss Football 101. \nHe’s blaming himself and his assistants for poor coaching. He’s blaming the players for poor execution. \nThere’s plenty blame to go around as Georgia Tech (2-4, 0-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) prepares to host Pittsburgh (4-1, 2-0 ACC) on Saturday. \nJunior quarterback Justin Thomas is trying to do too much. Linemen are missing basic assignments for an injury-riddled offense that played five true freshmen in last week’s blowout loss at Clemson. \nThe Jackets have lost four straight. \n___ \nAP college football website: http://collegefootball.ap.org \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T22:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:04:53.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
