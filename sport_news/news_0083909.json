The 112th meeting of the Dover Tornadoes and New Philadelphia Quakers football teams will commence Friday night at Dover’s Crater Stadium. Along with the longstanding rivalry, comes a week of fun activities for students and fans in both communities. BY THE NUMBERS The Tornadoes lead the overall series 54-48-9 and have dominated in the last decade, winning eight of the last 10 regular season matchups, including last year’s 34-0 win on the Quakers’ home turf. Dover and New Philadelphia met twice in 2008, with the Tornadoes winning 30-7 during the regular season matchup and 45-0 in a playoff tilt. Two of New Philadelphia’s last three wins have come in overtime. The Quakers won 21-20 in 2004 in OT, 31-28 in 2005 and a triple-overtime thriller in 2013 by a 34-28 count. The Quakers have posted 27 shutouts over the first 111 years, while Dover has held New Philadelphia scoreless 25 times. New Philadelphia’s highest point total in a contest is a 72-0 win in 1956, while the Tornadoes won 66-21 in 1998 for its highest point total. THE FUN BEGINS As is tradition for rivalry week, the students from both schools participate in themed dress-up days and numerous activities, including the annual blood drive and bonfires. It’s a tradition that helps rev-up an already intense rivalry and requires a lot of behind-the-scenes work to prepare for, students say. “We decorate the halls to help get the students involved and select judges to choose which class has the best hallway,” said Megan King, president of Dover High School’s student council. “The cheerleaders get input from a lot of students and the teachers in regard to the themed dress-up days. We try to make it fun for everyone leading up to the big game, which is my favorite part: the adrenaline that gets flowing on Friday at the game.” Despite the rivalry on the field, the two communities and schools will be teaming up for one common interest. Both schools are selling raffle tickets for a large gift basket. All ticket proceeds will go toward the medical expenses for one of Dover’s own, Brandon Myers. Myers, a recent Dover High School graduate and former football player, was diagnosed with kidney failure in June and is in need of a kidney transplant", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T14:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:30:35.363+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
