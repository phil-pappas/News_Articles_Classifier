(AP) - Johnny Cueto delivered a masterpiece on his biggest stage yet, pitching eight dominant innings Wednesday night and leading the never-say-die Kansas City Royals to a 7-2 victory over the Houston Astros and back to the American League Championship Series.\nCueto (1-0) allowed two hits, a single by Evan Gattis followed by Luis Valbuena's second-inning homer, before retiring the final 19 batters he faced. He struck out eight without a walk in the kind of clutch performance the Royals expected when they traded for him.\nWhen Wade Davis breezed through the ninth, the Royals poured onto the field to celebrate.\nThe defending AL champs will host the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 1 on Friday night. The teams have met once before in the ALCS with the Royals winning in seven games in 1985 - they would go on to beat the St. Louis Cardinals for their only World Series triumph.\nCHIEFS-CHARLES \nVikings' Peterson, Chiefs' Charles relate on ACL injuries\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - Vikings star Adrian Peterson offered encouragement to Jamaal Charles on Wednesday, three days after his Chiefs counterpart sustained a torn ACL in his right knee against Chicago.\nIt was Charles who, after tearing his left ACL four years ago, reached out to Peterson later in the season. Minnesota's running back had just torn the same ligament in his knee that December.\nBoth players returned from their injuries the following season.\nPeterson said he can't imagine having to go through the painful hours of rehabilitation for a second torn ACL, which Charles is facing. But he also said that his fellow Texan has the \"God-given ability\" to come back from such a devastating injury.\nThe Chiefs visit the Vikings on Sunday.\nVIKINGS-WR DEPTH \nWallace held out of Vikings practice; Johnson, Wright return\nEDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) - Mike Wallace was added in the offseason and Charles Johnson was expected to take another step in his second season with the Minnesota Vikings.\nJarius Wright was another building block of an improving receiving group, but Minnesota's passing game didn't really show itself in the schedule's first three weeks.\nThen the Vikings had to face the league's top defense in the Denver Broncos without Johnson or Wright.\nYet, in the process of a 23-20 loss at Denver, Minnesota unveiled its depth at the position where it's long tried to find playmakers.\nFollowing the bye and hosting the Kansas City Chiefs (1-4) the Vikings could be healthy and deep for second-year quarterback Teddy Bridgewater.\nMinnesota could have its entire group together against the Chiefs' 27th-ranked pass defense. Johnson returned to practice on a limited basis Wednesday for the first time since he was injured in Week 3. Wright was a full participant in Wednesday's practice.\nBKL-WNBA-FINALS \nLynx capture 3rd title in 5 years with 69-52 win in Game 5\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Sylvia Fowles had 20 points and 11 rebounds, and the Minnesota Lynx captured their third championship in five years with a 69-52 victory over the Indiana Fever in Game 5 of the WNBA Finals on Wednesday night.\nSeimone Augustus added 16 points and Rebekkah Brunson grabbed 14 rebounds for the Lynx, who also won it all in 2011 and 2013. Maya Moore scored just five points on 1-for-8 shooting, but the Lynx defense forced 21 turnovers and held Indiana to 35.7 percent shooting in the league's first Game 5 since 2009.\nTamika Catchings had 18 points and 11 rebounds for the Fever, who were looking for their second championship.\nThe Lynx finally got to celebrate a title on their home court after winning their first two on the road in Atlanta.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
