This is now much more than just a chance for Harbaugh to spoil the Spartans' unbeaten run. The winner of this matchup — whoever it is — becomes a clear contender for a Big Ten title and a spot in college football's playoff.\nMichigan State (6-0, 2-0 Big Ten) is unbeaten, while Michigan (5-1, 2-0) hasn't lost since its opener at Utah. Neither team's record is a huge departure from what was expected against their early-season schedules, but the way the Spartans and Wolverines are playing has been a surprise.\nMore Information\nGame capsules\nPenn State (5-1, 2-0 Big Ten) at Ohio State (6-0, 2-0) 8 p.m. (ABC-10)\nLine: Ohio State by 17\nSeries: Ohio State leads 16-13\nWhat's at stake: Co-leadership of the East Division. Four teams enter Saturday with 2-0 marks. The other two, Michigan and Michigan State, also play each other. The top-ranked Buckeyes face their biggest challenge to date as Penn State has won five straight after an opening loss to Temple.\nNo. 8 Florida (6-0, 4-0 SEC) at No. 6 LSU (5-0, 3-0), 7 p.m. (ESPN)\nLine: LSU by 9&frac12;\nSeries: Florida leads 31-27-3\nWhat's at stake: LSU is in the mix with Texas A&M, Alabama and Mississippi in a tight race for the SEC West. Florida will remain in control of the East race with a loss, but a win in Tiger Stadium would do wonders for the Gators College Football Playoff hopes.\nNo. 7 Michigan State (6-0, 2-0 Big Ten) at No. 12 Michigan (5-1, 2-0), 3:30 p.m. (ESPN)\nLine: Michigan by 81/2\nSeries: Michigan leads 68-34-5\nWhat's at stake: The winner becomes the top threat to Ohio State in the Big Ten's East Division and a serious contender for College Football Playoff — and yet all that feels secondary. What's at stake this weekend is Michigan State's seven-year dominance of the rivalry it cares about the most, a run of success that is now in serious jeopardy with Jim Harbaugh coaching at Michigan.\nUSC (3-2) at No. 14 Notre Dame (5-1), 7:30 p.m. (NBC-13)\nLine: Notre Dame by 61/2\nSeries: Notre Dame leads 45-36-5\nWhat's at stake: The Fighting Irish have to keep winning to keep their College Football Playoff hopes alive. USC already has lost two home conference games and is looking to end a tumultuous week after the firing of coach Steve Sarkisian, who entered an undisclosed treatment facility this week.\nMichigan State beat Purdue by three and Rutgers by seven. The Spartans were ranked as high as No. 2, but they've dropped amid mounting injuries and unconvincing victories.\nMichigan, meanwhile, has shut out its past three opponents and is dominating games in a way many didn't expect until a little later in Harbaugh's tenure.\nSo the Wolverines opened as three-point favorites and then the line grew to more than a touchdown.\n\"I think you're only underdogs if you think you're underdogs,\" Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio said. \"I will say Michigan is playing outstanding football right now, and we need to play better at certain points and times. But we are undefeated. We've found a way to win football games, that's the bottom line.\"\nMichigan State has won six of its past seven games against Michigan.\nThe team that ran for more yards has won 42 of the past 45 matchups in this series. Michigan State running backs LJ Scott and Madre London have been effective this season, and the Wolverines have leaned on De'Veon Smith .\nMichigan State lost linebacker Ed Davis and defensive backs Vayante Copeland and RJ Williamson to long-term injuries, and the offensive line has also been in flux because of health concerns. The Spartans' depth, especially in the secondary, is being tested.\nMichigan might have beaten Utah if Jake Rudock hadn't been intercepted three times in that game. He's only thrown three interceptions since then, but Michigan State will surely try to rattle him with an aggressive pass rush. Defensive lineman Shilique Calhoun is one of the top players in the Big Ten.\nMichigan State quarterback Connor Cook has played in plenty of big games, and perhaps the best path to victory for the Spartans is if their fifth-year senior outplays Rudock by a significant margin. But it won't be easy. Cook will be up against a Michigan secondary that's playing very well.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:20:22.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
