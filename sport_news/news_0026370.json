In reply to Gujarat's first innings total of 467, Punjab scored 608 all out, skipper Yuvraj being the top-scorer with 187 runs off 233 balls, including 14 boundaries and seven sixes. Yuvraj toyed with the Gujarat bowling attack as he scored at will against the seamers and spinners. Left-arm spinner Hardik Patel bore the full brunt of Yuvi's blade as he got repeatedly carted all over the ground. The Punjab captain hit seven sixes in his 233-ball knock, five of them coming off Patel's bowling. The 33-year-old scored his 24th first-class century with a big six over long on. Yesterday, Yuvraj opened his account and reached his half-century with a six; today he completed his century with a six too. Early in the morning, he got a reprieve when the wicketkeeper, Parthiv Patel, fluffed a simple catch. When play began on Day Four, Punjab were in danger of conceding the first innings lead but Yuvraj's ton took Punjab to the Gujarat total. It ensured three points for the home team. From there on, Yuvi shifted gears along with Siddarth Kaul and scored at a brisk pace in the hope of giving Gujarat a competitive score to chase and gather full six points for the team. Yuvraj got impatient to reach the double century mark, only to lob the ball to Bhargav Merai off Rujul Bhatt (160th over). On the very next ball, Maninder Singh fell and Punjab were back in the dressing room. Despite spinner Rujul Bhatt finishing with impressive figures of eight for 151, Gujarat failed to stop the hosts from taking the upper hand. Gujarat, in their second innings, reached 135/4 before the stumps were drawn. Bhargav Merai (56) scored a half-century in the second innings. Prior to this, Punjab had won one game (vs Railways) and lost one (vs Mumbai), while Gujarat too had won one and lost one. Bist helps HP earn 3 points Dharamsala: Dharamsala: Robin Bist scored a career-best unbeaten 220 as HP earned three points against Hyderabad from their Group C match that reached farcical proportions on the final day after the first hour in which the hosts got the lead. Starting the final day at 402/5 in reply to Hyderabad's 434, HP piled a mammoth 707/8 before declaring late in the day. With 13 mandatory overs to be bowled, Hyderabad made only 2 runs in them.
