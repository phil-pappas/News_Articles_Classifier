The Pack will look to move past Saturday’s stumble in a game head coach Dave Doeren is looking forward to. \n“I’m honored to coach a game against coach [Frank] Beamer,” Doeren said. “I think he’s one of the classiest people that I’ve met in this business and someone I really respect and look up to.” \nMeanwhile, the Hokies (2-3, 0-1 ACC) lost 17-13 to the Pittsburgh Panthers (3-1, 1-0 ACC). Quarterback Brenden Motley never got anything going during the game, as he had three interceptions and completed less than 50 percent of attempted passes. Beamer recognized the game against the Wolfpack is a must-win during his press conference Monday. \n“They probably have more weapons offensively than we’ve seen all year, next to Ohio State,” Beamer said about State at his weekly press conference. “It’s another critical game. We have to make great preparations, and I think we will and go play our very best.” \nCopyright 2015 by Technician. All rights reserved.
