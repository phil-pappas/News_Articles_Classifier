Keeping that appearance will be critical come committee time.\nHaving survived a scare against Texas Tech, the Frogs know the fine line CFP contenders walk. They have a challenging stretch with three of the next four games on the road, including Kansas State on Saturday and Oklahoma State on Nov. 7.\nDespite the loss of seven defensive starters to injury, the Frogs appear to be gaining strength. That 14 different defensive players have made their first career start speaks volumes about their depth. This could result in a big payoff with some of the injured returning for the playoff march.\nWith big wins over Tennessee and West Virginia, Oklahoma seems a lock over beleaguered Texas but rivalry games are potent grounds for upsets. Baylor has yet to be tested. Close wins over lesser opponents, such as Saturday against Kansas, will leave the Bears little margin for error.\nOklahoma State has gone through its share of struggles, but keeps winning. The low-profile Cowboys have the tough task of playing on the road against West Virginia. This would be a quality win for OSU, which plays fellow conference contenders Baylor, TCU and Oklahoma at home.\nTwitter: @BillNicholsDMN\nNo. 13 Northwestern (+7 1/2) at No. 18 Michigan 2:30 p.m. (Big Ten Network): You can throw out the calculator in this Big Ten matchup. If both teams give up their average points allowed, then Northwestern will win by half a safety. The Wildcats (5-0) are surrendering just seven points per game as they try to improve to 6-0 for the first time in 53 years. The Wolverines (4-1) are allowing 7.6 points per game after consecutive shutouts. As the hoopla escalated this week, Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh suggested that points may be scored, and he made a pretty good point based on years of breaking down film. \"The two defenses won't go against each other in the game, they won't face other,'' he said. Northwestern 23, Michigan 20.\nNo. 2 TCU at Kansas State (+10 1/2) 6:30 p.m. (Ch. 4): The Frogs are rolling at a 50.8-point, 603.0-yard pace the last four games. Trevone Boykin has thrown for 1,802 yards and 19 touchdowns, moving into the national top 10 in quarterback rating (174.0). Last year against Kansas State, Boykin rushed for 123 yards and three TDs in the Frogs' win. Despite last week's dramatic 36-34 loss to Oklahoma State, the Wildcats loom large to an undefeated opponent with playoff on its mind. Veteran K-State coach Bill Snyder said his team will need \"to score throughout the course of the ballgame\" to counter TCU's prolific offense. TCU 44, Kansas State 30.\nNo. 23 California (+7) at No. 5 Utah 9 p.m. (ESPN): Who would have thought that these would be the Pac-12's only undefeated teams in week six? The Golden Bears, two years removed from 1-11, are off to their best start since 2007. The Utes are ranked No. 5 (third time in school history), thanks largely to their victory over then-No. 13 Oregon two weeks ago. Such lofty heights can be scary to the uninitiated. \"It's almost like living in a biosphere or a dome,'' Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said. ''You've got people tapping on the glass and looking in at you.\" Among the eyes: ESPN's ''College GameDay'' will be on hand for a Cal game for the first time since 2009. Utah 31, California 23.\nMiami (+9) at No. 12 Florida State 7 p.m. (Ch. 8): Rushing has been a big player in this rivalry. The team that runs for the most yards has won 20 of the past 28 meetings. Since Jimbo Fisher arrived at Florida State as offensive coordinator in 2007, the Seminoles are averaging 182.9 rushing yards against Miami. In the Seminoles' 30-26 win last year, Dalvin Cook ran for 92 yards and scored two touchdowns, including the game-winner with three minutes left. But Cook may not be at full strength because of a strained hamstring. Florida State 37, Miami 30.\nLine through Tuesday.\nLAST WEEK: 3-1 straight, 3-1 vs line.\nSEASON: 14-6 straight, 14-5-1 vs. line.\nOn Twitter:\n @BillNicholsDMN", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BillNicholsDMN"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:13:14.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
