In a press note issued here today, Anurag Thakur had claimed that the railways authorities had begun looking into the modalities. A number of social and religious bodies have been demanding setting up of a railway station near the shrine on the Una-Talwara broad gauge line since the shrine attracts devotees from Himachal Pradesh as well as the neighbouring states. Besides, the devotees coming here also visit the shrineâ€™s ashram in Haridwar, which has a direct rail connectivity through this broad gauge line. The Member of Parliament, Anurag Thakur,, said the allocation of funds for the electrification of the Una to Amb Andaura section had been done and work on laying the Amb-Andaura to Daulatpur Chowk rail section in Una district was going on in full swing to link the Delhi-Una rail line with the Jalandhar-Jammu broad gauge line.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:09:25.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
