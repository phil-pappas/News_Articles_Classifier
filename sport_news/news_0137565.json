I look forward to getting back to work and bringing another championship back to Boston.” \nFarrell was diagnosed with stage 1 Non-Hodgkin’s Burkitt lymphoma on Aug. 14. Red Sox bench coach Torey Lovullo made a seamless transition as interim manager and the Red Sox played some of their best baseball under his watch, but Lovullo refused to sit in the manager’s office at Fenway Park or in road stadiums. He and the Sox continued to view Farrell as the manager, while the official wins and losses were put on Farrell’s record rather than Lovullo’s, a precedent enforced by Elias Sports Bureau. \nFarrell still showed up for most home games, even after he lost most of his hair. \nOn the last day of the regular season, Red Sox president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski made the official announcement that Farrell would return as manager in 2016. \nEven if Farrell is slow to build back stamina and needs extra time to rest when spring training begins in February in Fort Myers, the Sox will let Lovullo stand in Farrell’s place until the 53-year-old manager is ready to return. \n“I told him all along that he needs to be healthy, first and foremost,” Dombrowski said earlier this month. “Hopefully John’s back, he’s feeling great, he’s ready to go. If for some reason, he’s a little slower to come back or not 100 percent, his trusted right-hand lieutenant is there for him to help him at that point, so that’s really how we went with it.” \nDombrowski said bringing back Farrell was “the right thing to do from an organizational perspective. He’s won before. He’s deserved it.” More On:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:06:52.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
