(AP) - While everyone may want to focus on the Dallas Cowboys not having the injured Tony Romo and Dez Bryant, they have lost four in a row because of their own mistakes. \nThere’s plenty of fault to go around, and it was obvious Sunday in a 27-20 loss to the New York Giants. \n- Matt Cassel threw three interceptions in his first start for Dallas, including a pick-six by Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. \n- The Cowboys’ special teams allowed former teammate Dwayne Harris to score on a 100-yard kickoff return with 7:01 to play, after Cassel had tied the game 13 seconds earlier with a touchdown pass to Devin Street. \n- Dallas (2-4) also lost four points after a penalty nullified Darren McFadden’s touchdown and was forced to settle for a field goal. \n- Finally, any chance Dallas had to tie the game ended when Cole Beasley muffed a punt with 1:26 to play and the Giants (4-3) recovered. \n“This is a tight group and we’re not going to break. We give them credit. They made enough plays to win the game but we’re going to keep battling and we’ll learn from it,” Cowboys tight end Jason Witten said. “We’re still in the hunt. We’re going to get it turned around and get it fixed.” \nThere is a chance that Bryant will come back next week from the foot injury he sustained in the season opener against New York. Romo won’t be back from his broken collarbone until mid-November. \n“We haven’t made a play when it was there all year,” Dallas linebacker Sean Lee said. “We’ve had it in our hands and we’ve dropped them. You can’t have big plays. For us, we have to have big plays, we have to finish plays and finish games. Last year, we did that well, but this year we haven’t done that as consistently.” \nThe win allowed New York to snap a five-game slide against Dallas and it gave coach Tom Coughlin his 100th regular-season triumph with the Giants. \nRodgers-Cromartie had two interceptions, returning one 58 yards for a touchdown. Brandon Meriweather also had a pick, while Myles White grabbed Beasley’s muff to put it away. \nHarris spent four seasons in Dallas without running back a kickoff for a score. But he tied a Giants record set in 1994 by romping untouched to the end zone. \n“It felt great, especially my first return in the NFL, and it felt great coming against my old teammates,” said Harris, who left Dallas because the Giants planned to use him as a receiver. \nMcFadden rushed for 152 yards and a touchdown, getting 29 carries after starting running back Joseph Randle left with a strained back. \nCassel forced some throws including the one Rodgers-Cromartie returned for his seventh touchdown in eight pro seasons, six by interceptions. He had a 57-yard run back with a fumble against Dallas in the season opener.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:46:14.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
