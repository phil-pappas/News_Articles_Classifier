(Photo by Jason Miller/Getty Images) Seahawks activate FB Derrick Coleman, re-sign C Lemuel Jeanpierre 1 / 6 Back to Gallery \nThe Seattle Seahawks activated fullback Derrick Coleman off the reserve/suspended by club list in one of a flurry of Tuesday roster moves. \nColeman, 25, had been suspended by the team indefinitely after he was arrested for investigation of vehicular assault and hit-and-run following a two-car crash in Bellevue on Wednesday. \nHe was released from King County Jail on Friday while prosecutors decide whether or not they will press charges. That decision should come next month, after they receive toxicology results of a blood test administered after the crash. \nOn Monday, head coach Pete Carroll announced the team's intentions to reinstate Coleman. It's unknown at this time if he will play in the Hawks' Thursday night matchup versus the San Francisco 49ers. \nSeattle also brought back a familiar face in free agent center Lemuel Jeanpierre, who was signed by the team on Tuesday, nearly two months after he was released by the team on Aug. 31. \nJeanpierre, who can also play guard, should help provide the Hawks with some depth after center Patrick Lewis suffered ankle and knee injuries in his first start of the year in Sunday's 27-23 loss to the Carolina Panthers. \nThe 28-year-old originally joined Seattle as an undrafted free agent out of South Carolina in 2010. He appeared in 53 games for the Seahawks from 2011 to 2014, starting 11. \nTo make room for Coleman and Jeanpierre on the 53-man active roster, Seattle waived cornerback Crezdon Butler and placed linebacker Brock Coyle on the injured reserve/designated to return list. \nCoyle, 25, had appeared in the Hawks' first five games, playing almost exclusively on special teams, before missing Sunday's game versus the Panthers with a knee injury. He will be eligible to return to the active roster in Week 15. \nButler, 28, signed with Seattle last week to provide short-term cornerback depth with Marcus Burley and Tye Smith out with injuries. Smith should return Thursday versus the 49ers, Carroll said on Monday. \nVisit seattlepi.com for more Seattle Seahawks news .
