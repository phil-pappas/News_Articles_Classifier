So I follow it a lot.\"\nOf course, Durant's first choice would be his favorite squad:\nMy first priority would be the Washington Redskins, even if it was just a small percentage. I just want to get involved. Growing up five minutes away from the stadium and always being a fan, I have a Redskins tattoo on my forearm.
