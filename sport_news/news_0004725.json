The Moundbuilders defeated the Swedes of Bethany College, 24-0, Saturday afternoon at Richard L. Jantz Stadium. Southwestern notched its first shutout since a 65-0 win over Haskell Indian Nations on Oct. 1, 2011, and its first Kansas Collegiate Athletic Conference shutout since Nov. 11, 2006 (27-0 over McPherson) with Saturday's 24-0 victory. The win was the fourth-straight homecoming win for the Moundbuilders, and moves Southwestern to 4-2 in homecoming games played inside Richard L. Jantz Stadium. Southwestern (2-5, 2-3 KCAC) put an end to a first-quarter chess match, and took advantage of the first Bethany (1-6, 1-4 KCAC) error to set up its first scoring drive of the game. Jessup Bliven blocked a Swede punt, and gave the Moundbuilders the ball at the Bethany 17 yard line. Two plays later, Brady Keith found pay dirt from 11 yards out. Mario Esparza's extra-point kick completed the scoring play, and gave Southwestern a 7-0 lead at the end of the first quarter. The Moundbuilders needed nearly every inch of the field to score their second touchdown of the contest. After a deep Bethany punt rolled to the six-inch line, Southwestern put together a 14-play, 99-yard scoring drive capped by a 7-yard pass from Braden Langston to Landers Riddle. Esparza's kick pushed the Moundbuilder lead to 14-0 with 6:48 to play in the opening half. kA 4=2DDlQAbQm$@FE9H6DE6C?
