The whistles are heard more loudly than the applause but it is getting better,\" he said.\n\"In no moment will they find that I have said something negative about this national team or this country.\"\nPique, 28, is a huge personality in Spain as he has two sons with Colombian pop superstar Shakira and has campaigned in favour of a referendum to decide on Catalan independence.\nHowever, he has previously stated he doesn't believe the Catalan issue is a reason for his treatment by the Spanish support as a host of other Catalan players in the squad have not been treated the same way.\n\"This is my home and my family. I have been coming here since the first day I was called-up and I have always been received warmly and treated well.\n\"They can't doubt me. The national team is part of me. I hope that this passes and they speak about football.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:38:37.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
