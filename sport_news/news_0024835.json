(AP) - A former Natchitoches (NAK-uh-tesh) police officer has been convicted of killing a 24-year-old Many (MAN-ee) resident, and has accepted life in prison rather than risk execution.\nDistrict Attorney Don Burkett tells KTBS-TV ( http://bit.ly/1QEo30d ) that Robert Barthelemy waived all appeals and agreed never to ask any court to reduce his sentence in the death of Tony Procell.\nJurors convicted Barthelemy on Thursday and heard victim impact statements Friday. Barthelemy agreed to the sentence on Saturday.\nKSLA-TV ( http://bit.ly/1LXzrju ) reports that defense lawyers argued that Barthelemy killed Procell because he had post-traumatic stress disorder and thought Procell had made Barthelemy's estranged wife pregnant.\nThe jury was chosen in St. Landry Parish after a judge decided that pretrial reports had made it too difficult to find an unbiased jury in Sabine Parish.\nCopyright redistributed.", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1QEo30d", "http://bit.ly/1LXzrju"], "published": "2015-10-19T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:19:16.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
