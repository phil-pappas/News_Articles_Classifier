The Bobcats are 19-9 all-time versus the Vikings. \nIt’s been an emphatic start to the Bruce Barnum era at Portland State. \nBarnum, chosen interim coach in the offseason after the dismissal of Nigel Burton, has quickly pulled the Vikings from obscurity with two wins over FBS opponents on the strength of an unyielding defense. \nPortland State is 4-1 overall, 1-1 in the Big Sky Conference and ranked 17th in the latest STATS Top 25 FCS poll. The Vikings no longer are an afterthought. And Barnum, on the heels of a 66-7 blowout of FBS North Texas last week, shed the interim tag by being awarded a five-year contract Wednesday. \nThe Vikings have been galvanized by a style of play they’re calling “Barney Ball.” \n“Coach Barnum has done an awesome job with that team this year,” said Rob Ash, whose 16th-ranked Bobcats face the Vikings on Saturday at historic Providence Park, formerly named Civic Stadium. “Last week’s blowout was the most amazing thing I’ve ever seen. \n“For an FCS team to go play an FBS team like that and thrash them like Portland State did, that was extremely impressive.” \nThe Bobcats (3-2, 2-1) haven’t lost to Portland State since the 2005 season. Ash is 7-0 against the Vikings during his nine-year tenure. \nBut if ever there was heightened importance on a game, this is it. Montana State is coming off a 35-13 victory at home against Sacramento State but has lost four consecutive road games. \nThe Cats can’t afford to start slowly like they have in those previous contests. \n“In order for us to do what we want to do against these guys we have to get on them early and make them play our game,” Bobcats offensive lineman J.P. Flynn said. “That is one trend you see throughout the Big Sky. Northern Arizona got on us early and we had to play their game and they ended up winning. \n“When you jump on teams early, they’re playing a game they don’t want to play. In order for us to be successful we have to start early, continue throughout the game and finish well.” \nFlynn and MSU’s No. 1-ranked offense will be going head-to-head with the league’s top-ranked defense. \nPortland State leads the Big Sky in scoring defense (11.4 ppg) and total defense (294.2 ypg), pass-efficiency defense (94.0 rating), third-down defense (24.4 percent) and fewest opponent first downs (15.8). \nThe Bobcats, under the direction of quarterback Dakota Prukop, lead the Big Sky in scoring (43.2 ppg) and total offense (564.8 ypg). \n“We know what Montana State is. It is a powerhouse,” Barnum said. “Coach Ash has built a program that everybody’s shooting for. You see it on film. They are a well-coached program.” \nPortland State is riding high after its impressive win at North Texas. It was the largest margin of victory ever by any FCS team over an FBS opponent. \nThe Vikings also beat Washington State 24-17 in their season opener Sept. 5. \n“The way this league is, it feels like every game is a major tipping point for everybody,” Ash said. “It’s very, very balanced. Anybody can beat anybody on any given day. The next game is always the most important one, and that’s how we’re looking at this one.” \n3 to watch \nKeep an eye on these Portland State players: \n1. Alex Kuresa, QB : Dual-threat quarterback had his first 300-yard passing game versus North Texas. Has 287 rushing yards through five games. Formerly of BYU, came to Portland State from Snow Junior College in Utah, where he accounted for 33 TDs in 2014. \n2. Patrick Onwuasor, S : A 6-foot-2, 225-pounder who loves to play up to stop the run but is also strong in pass coverage. His three interceptions are tied for the league lead. Has four pass breakups and seven passes defended. Is the team’s second-leading tackler. \n3. David Jones, RB : Leads the Vikings with 336 rushing yards while averaging 7.5 yards per carry. Rushed for 134 yards and two touchdowns, including a 70-yarder, at North Texas. One of five PSU players with at least one 100-yard rushing game.
