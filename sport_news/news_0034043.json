Their 12-round fight for Gonzalez’s WBC flyweight title will be broadcast by HBO Pay-Per-View on Saturday night, just before the Gennady Golovkin-David Lemieux middleweight championship unification fight at Madison Square Garden. Nicaragua’s Gonzalez (43-0, 37 KOs) ascended to the top of several prominent pound-for-pound lists since Floyd Mayweather Jr. retired last month, but Hawaii’s Viloria (36-4, 22 KOs) is the most proven opponent of a pro career that began for 112-pound champion Gonzalez amid minimal fanfare in July 2005. Viloria, a 2000 Olympian, is 34, however, and might’ve experienced too many physically taxing fights during his 14-year pro career to truly test the heavy-handed Gonzalez, 28.\nLOCAL LOOK: Hasbrouck Heights’ Julian Rodriguez (10-0, 9 KOs) will return to the ring against Mexico’s Alvaro Ortiz (7-4-1, 5 KOs) on Oct. 24 in Omaha, Neb. Their non-televised six-rounder will mark Rodriguez’s first fight since the highly touted junior welterweight prospect underwent shoulder surgery in June to repair a slight tear to his left labrum. \nTHE FINAL BELL: As if recognizing as many as four world champions in each of boxing’s 17 weight classes isn’t confusing enough, the WBA has a \"super\" middleweight champion (Golovkin; 160 pounds) and a \"super\" super middleweight champion (Andre Ward; 168 pounds). Yes, you read that correctly. The WBA basically scams sanctioning fees out of as many boxers as possible. The Venezuela-based organization has elevated 11 of its titleholders to \"super\" champion status. That means the WBA acknowledges two world champions in all but six divisions and takes sanctioning fees, usually 3 percent of a fighter’s purse, from 22 champions and 22 challengers in 11 divisions on at least a semi-regular basis. Starting Saturday night with Golovkin-Lemieux, the WBA will sanction two middleweight title fights within a seven-week period. Daniel Jacobs (30-1, 27 KOs) is scheduled to defend his WBA \"world\" middleweight title against Peter Quillin (32-0-1, 23 KOs) on Dec. 5 at Barclays Center.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:48:21.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
