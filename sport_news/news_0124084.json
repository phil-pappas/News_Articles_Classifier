Alabama is a two-touchdown favorite and playing like one of the best teams in the country right now while the 2015 Vols have become known for fading late in games and have been decimated by injuries. \nMeanwhile across the state, the 4-2 Auburn Tigers are preparing to face off against the 2-4 Arkansas Razorbacks and despite their respective records, the Hogs are favored by as many as 5.5 points in Las Vegas. The two teams have both been disappointments so far this year and both could be fighting for a shot at preserving bowl eligibility this weekend. \nExcited yet? You should be, because these two games could be among the most emotionally-charged football games you see this season. That's what a little old-fashioned hate will do for an otherwise lackluster football game in the SEC. \nTennessee hasn't beaten Alabama in 9 years. That's a long time. George W. Bush was still the president. The iPhone didn't exist. We still thought \"Snakes On A Plane\" might be end up being a good movie. \nAnd yet Alabama fans are still fired up about playing the Vols and it's because of hatred. It's a hatred born of betrayal, humiliation and jealousy - all the great ingredients of a Shakespearian drama. Alabama could beat Tennessee on Saturday and the next 9 times after that and it wouldn't lessen that hatred one iota. \nThe hate between Auburn and Arkansas is a relatively new one but no less intense. If Gus Malzahn represents one idea, Bret Bielema represents the opposing idea. One plays fast, the other likes to slow things down. One guy wears turtlenecks and sweater vests, the other likes to let it all hang out on occasion . Malzahn is a quiet, reserved guy when it comes to the media. Good luck getting an explosive quote from Gus at a press conference. Bielema can barely make it through a sentence without lighting up Twitter. \nDon't tell Auburn and Arkansas that the only thing they're playing for this weekend is another SEC win in a season in which those might be hard to come by. There's so much more at stake this weekend for both programs. Both are looking for a win that could validate their chosen ideology. Both want to prove that they have the guy who's doing it the right way. Most of all, they both teams just want to see the other one lose. That's what hate is all about and that's why this weekend could be the most intense college football weekend of the 2015 season to date in the state of Alabama. \nJoin me at 10 a.m. Central time to chat in the comments section below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:23:52.554+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
