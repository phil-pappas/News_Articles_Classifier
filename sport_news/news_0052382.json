Winners \nBashaud Breeland — Two fumble recoveries and one awesome interception in the first half alone. Chris says he’s getting a Breeland jersey. He should just modify his Portis; it’s best not to commit. \nDustin Hopkins — I love this man and his touchbacks and 50-plus-yard field goals. Kirk Cousins has 4 multi-interception games in 6 weeks, the same number Robert Griffin III had in 37 games across his first three seasons. \n— Matt Ufford (@mattufford) October 19, 2015 Losers \nKirk Cousins — Quarterbacks of mediocre teams with decent defenses and nominally run-focused offenses aren’t asked to do very much. Just “manage the game,” really, meaning don’t turn it over. But Cousins has four multi-interception games already this season, all Redskins losses. Today’s performance was so poor it won’t be much of a surprise if Jay Gruden, acting president of the Kirk Cousins Fan Club , turns to Colt McCoy next week.
