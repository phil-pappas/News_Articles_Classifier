Daly said test results show an increase among players, but he estimated no more than 20 used cocaine.\nA week ago Maple Leafs prospect Victor Loov talked to the Swedish newspaper Södertälje about drugs and hockey.\n“In the NHL,” Loov said, “there’s a lot of cocaine.”\nHe said he didn’t use the drug himself, nor was he aware of any Marlies teammates that did, but cocaine was “the talk” among players.\n“I’m sure it’s not just talk,” Loov said. “There are players everywhere who are doing it … It does not feel like the NHL is really taking it seriously, that they do not do much about it. In the club we talk about doping, but not about (illicit) drugs and stuff.”\nTSN, citing two unnamed sources, reported Monday that a member of Maple Leafs management met with Toronto police last season “to address concerns that Leafs players were purportedly using cocaine.”\nThe Leafs declined to comment to the Star.\nNHLPA executive director Donald Fehr, who would not comment on any negotiations with the league, has been active in raising awareness about the problems of cocaine with both NHL executives and players, a source told the Star.\nFormer NHLer Rich Clune, now with the Marlies, opened up about his drug addiction in the online Players Tribune , suggesting substance abuse is widespread.\n“I am certainly not unique,” Clune wrote. “There are players in the NHL right now who are suffering and you would never know it from looking at their stat sheet or how hard they compete in practice.”\nThe New York Rangers signed Jarret Stoll, formerly of the Los Angeles Kings, after the 33-year-old pleaded guilty in June to two reduced misdemeanour charges to resolve a felony cocaine case stemming from his April 17 arrest in Las Vegas. Stoll was arrested at MGM Grand’s Wet Republic pool with what was reported as 3.3 grams of cocaine and several ecstasy capsules in his pocket.\nFormer NHLer Ryan Malone, then with the Tampa Lightning, was arrested for cocaine possession in April 2014.\nWhile Daly insisted the number of NHL players testing positive for cocaine was small, TSN pointed out that cocaine use is easily masked and can be flushed from the system in 24 hours, so the number of players using it — and passing drug tests — could be higher than estimated by Daly.\nPlayers are educated each year on the dangers of drug abuse. And each player is urine-tested at least twice, with some tested three times. But testing focuses on performance-enhancing drugs. Only one-third of those tested are also checked for illicit drugs.\nIf testing indicates a player is using illicit drugs, he is directed to the NHL-NHLPA substance abuse program, according to the collective bargaining agreement. It is up to the doctors appointed by the league and the NHLPA to decide how long he stays in the program and remains inactive as a player.\nMore on thestar.com\nAstros’ Keuchel will face Yankees on three days’ rest\nHazelton rejoins Argos’ fight for first after one-game ban", "external_links": ["http://espn.go.com/newyork/nhl/story/_/id/13408903/newyork-rangers-agree-terms-jarret-stoll", "http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js", "http://lt.se/sport/ishockey/1.3171558-loov-vissa-krokar-nar-som-helst-", "http://www.theplayerstribune.com/rich-clune-hockey-nhl/", "http://www.tsn.ca/on-eve-of-season-nhl-acknowledges-possibly-more-players-using-cocaine-1.372075"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:50:51.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
