That is a dangerous and possibly contract ending gamble.\" 2014/15 Liverpool season preview Forbes August 3, 2015 On Sunday, Fenway Sports Group owners of Liverpool FC since 2010, pulled the plug on a manager for the third time. Brendan Rodgers has now joined Kenny Dalglish and Roy Hodgson as notches on owner John W Henry’s managerial bedpost. The pay-off to Rodgers is expected to cost FSG in excess of $10M.Earlier in the day Liverpool and played to a 1-1 draw with city rivals Everton in the Premier League at Goodison Park and although the result extended Liverpool's unbeaten run to six matches the team's general play has been uninspiring this season. An extract of @LFC 's statement announcing the news of Rodgers' sacking... #SSNHQ pic.twitter.com/6zAoU2PBnW\n— Sky Sports News HQ (@SkySportsNewsHQ) October 4, 2015 Rodgers was appointed in 2012 after a successful spell with Swansea City. Under Rodgers, Liverpool finished 7 th , 2 nd and 6 th in the Premier League and after this weekend’s fixtures the club sat in mid-table with 12 points from eight games. A look at Brendan Rodgers' league record.

Fired by the attacking play of Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge Liverpool’s philosophy of no matter how many the opposition scores we will score more fired up Liverpool fans and neutrals alike.But a home loss to Chelsea and a 3-3 draw with Crystal Palace after leading 3-0 opened the door for Manchester City and the best Liverpool could do was the runners up spot.After more than three years in charge the general consensus from critics and fans alike was that there were no signs that Rodgers was the man to fix Liverpool’s problems. Defensive problems remained endemic and scoring sporadic.If anything the prevailing view is that Liverpool should have made the move last summer rather than offering Rodgers a chance at redemption this season.Some would say to his credit – others would offer it as evidence of indecision – Rodgers never stood still and he constantly changed formation in attempt to rectify the team’s problems. But in the end it was tantamount to shifting the deckchairs on the Titanic.FSG provided significant transfer funds through Rodgers tenure although there was also a significant return to the club from selling Luis Suarez to Barcelona in 2014 for over $110M and last summer Raheem Sterling was sold to Manchester City for around $75M.However, there have been a lot more transfer misses than successes under Rodgers although how much blame can be parked at his doorstep and how much belongs to the infamous transfer committee operated by Liverpool is another debate. £106m spent and no trophies under Brendan Rodgers: http://t.co/USbaP0gNJ6 , #MOTD2 pic.twitter.com/zjBAZDS2I2\n— Match of the Day (@BBCMOTD) October 4, 2015 You can argue whether or not the manager or a Director of Football should plot and execute transfer strategy but it should be clear to anyone, particularly owner John W Henry, that accountability comes from one person being responsible and not a committee. So Rodgers has gone. A decisive move from FSG. Wonder how many of Liverpool's \"transfer committee\" will join him. A horribly flawed strategy— Phil McNulty (@philmcnulty) October 4, 2015 Whether the next manager is encumbered with a similar system will no doubt be part of upcoming negotiations.A favored shortlist proffered by a number of outlets includes six names: Jurgen Klopp (4/7 betting odds), Carlo Ancelotti (5/1), Walter Mazzarri (8/1), Frank de Boer (10/1), Ronald Koeman (20/1) and Diego Simone (25/1)The dismissal of Rodgers came before a designated international break which means Liverpool do not return to action until October 17.If a new manager is installed by then he will face a tough baptism with a schedule of Tottenham Hotspur (away), Southampton (home), Chelsea (away), Crystal Palace (home), Manchester City (away) and Swansea City (home) before the end of November.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/SSNHQ?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/SkySportsNewsHQ/status/650736655767199744", "http://t.co/MJtw2sRinU", "http://t.co/uWN6D0FzmK", "https://twitter.com/SkySportsNewsHQ/status/650780016129740800", "https://twitter.com/philmcnulty/status/650784692225052672", "https://twitter.com/BBCMOTD/status/650789700802711552", "https://twitter.com/LFC", "http://t.co/USbaP0gNJ6", "http://t.co/zjBAZDS2I2", "http://t.co/6zAoU2PBnW", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/MOTD2?src=hash"], "published": "2015-10-05T08:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:58:40.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
