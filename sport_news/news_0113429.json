It's obviously a classic.\"\nSchrimmer owns a 1981 DeLorean Motor Company DMC-12, outfitted with a flux capacitor, Mr. Fusion reactor and a whole lot more of the details that director Robert Zemeckis and his crew fastened onto the now-iconic vehicle that transported Marty McFly through time. Schrimmer's DeLorean is not \"the DeLorean,\" but a replica constructed by Bob's Prop Shop in Dallas. He said he bought it in 2011 for around $60,000.\nAll of the students there were born years after the movies left the box office.\nAlexa Chmieleski, a senior from Buffalo Grove, said she loved the franchise as a young girl, but made a decision when she was in sixth grade: She would not watch Part II again until Oct. 20, 2015, the night before Michael J. Fox's famous character leapt into a future that, when the movie came out, was decades away.\n\"I promised myself that I would wait,\" and Chmieleski said the payoff came Tuesday night, when her family stayed up to watch it for the first time in years.\nDeLorean franchises take fans 'Back to the Future' with DMC sales Matt Schmitz, Cars.com One year from today will be Wednesday, Oct. 21, 2015, the date to which Doc Brown flew Marty McFly 30 years into the space-time continuum with the help of their flux-capacitor-powered DeLorean time machine in \"Back to the Future.\" Yet we're still waiting on those flying cars, hoverboards and power-lacing...\nOne year from today will be Wednesday, Oct. 21, 2015, the date to which Doc Brown flew Marty McFly 30 years into the space-time continuum with the help of their flux-capacitor-powered DeLorean time machine in \"Back to the Future.\" Yet we're still waiting on those flying cars, hoverboards and power-lacing...\n(Matt Schmitz, Cars.com) But the vehicle beneath the \"time machine\" veneer carries an unmistakably 1980s style.\nJake Davis, a junior from Buffalo Grove, said it felt odd to be up close to something that is now from the distant past.\n\"If it didn't have a meaning behind it, you'd be like, 'Oh, it's an old car,'\" Davis said.\nThe trip from his business, Windy City Novelties, down Milwaukee Avenue to Stevenson was the first time Schrimmer ever brought his machine out of the warehouse he keeps it in. He received a police escort for the drive, but then stepped away and watched with a near-constant smile as throngs of teenagers jumped in and out of the two seats, posed on its hood and gawked all around it.\nSchrimmer said he brought his machine out for one reason: His nephew, Ryan Aronoff, teaches communication arts at Stevenson. Usually, its odometer simply holds steady at around 17,000 miles.\nThe DeLorean was the creation of John Z. DeLorean, who left General Motors to start his own automaker. From 1981 to 1982, the DeLorean Motor Company made approximately 9,200 cars at a factory near Belfast in Northern Ireland. They were all sold with a stainless steel exterior and no paint.\nHow realistic is the 2015 of 'Back to the Future: Part II'? Kevin Pang As we near 'the future,' visions for 2015 from 'Back to the Future Part II' are hit and miss As we near 'the future,' visions for 2015 from 'Back to the Future Part II' are hit and miss (Kevin Pang) Schrimmer's replica is accurate down to the fine details: the colors of the buttons inside, and the number of vents in the smoke-blowers attached to the back. The speedometer tops out at 85, as required by federal law at the time, but the car is perfectly capable of going the 88 mph Marty and Doc Brown required to travel through time, Schrimmer said. Its license plate reads \"BTTF,\" or \"Back to the Future\" — a relevant abbrevation, considering #BTTF2015 was trending on Twitter for much of the day Wednesday.\nWhen he jumped inside, though, junior Larry Patlakh from Buffalo Grove did not care. What caught his attention was the size of the interior.\n\"It's kind of cramped in there,\" he said after letting the next student inside.\nEmily Krolak, a sophomore from Buffalo Grove, simply marveled at the arrival of \"Back to the Future Day.\" The film's predictions of Skype, Google Glass, a populace with a penchant for healthy foods and more have come eerily close to the real 2015, she said.\n\"We didn't know what the future would be like, and it used to be so cool to imagine the future,\" Krolak said.\nBut as Schrimmer drove his time machine away that afternoon, the future slipped into the past. Chicagoland may not get to see his DeLorean again: He promised that the trip to Stevenson would be its only public appearance.\n\"This is it,\" Schrimmer said.\nrwachter@pioneerlocal.com\nTwitter: @RonnieAtPioneer\n High Schools Michael J.
