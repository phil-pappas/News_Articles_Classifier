Last season: Bishop Feehan beat Martha’s Vineyard, 23-7. Martha’s Vineyard is 0-6 against Bishop Feehan dating back to 2009. Notes: Senior running back Ben Clark and receiver Curtis Farrell have been huge for the Vineyarders this season, each scoring in all three games this season, and they might need another big game to finally thwart Shamrocks and get their second Eastern Athletic Conference win. Clark scored twice and Farrell once against Coyle-Cassidy in Week 3, each player upping his season total to four. Junior Elijah Matthews added a punt-return touchdown last week, and Jacob Cardoza rushed for 167 yards. Cardoza also scored in Week 2 and caught a 50-yard touchdown pass last year against Bishop Feehan. Barnstable at New Bedford 7 p.m. in New Bedford Last week: Barnstable (0-3, 0-0 OCL) lost to Xaverian, 35-0; New Bedford (1-2, 0-0 Big 3) lost to Bridgewater-Raynham, 32-12. Last season: New Bedford beat Barnstable, 14-0. Barnstable beat New Bedford in 2013 and 2012. Notes: The Red Raiders couldn’t do much against the defending Division 1 state champions last week, and they’re still looking for their first win of the season. A win in Week 4 would require a much better effort than last year against the Whalers, when Barnstable put up just 138 yards of total offense and allowed six sacks and 14 plays for negative yardage. Junior quarterback Keaton Bergal looked solid through his first two games, rushing for two touchdowns in Week 1 and firing off a touchdown pass to senior Nate Balthazard in Week 2, but through three games the Red Raiders’ defense has already given up 130 points. Mashpee at Cohasset 7 p.m. at Alumni Field, Cohasset Last week: Mashpee (2-1, 1-0 SSL-Small) beat Carver, 41-16; Cohasset (2-1, 1-0 SSL-Small) beat Hull, 31-7. Last season: Cohasset beat Mashpee, 27-0. Mashpee last beat Cohasset in 2012. Notes: The Skippers shut out the Falcons in a game that decided the 2014 South Shore League Small title, and both teams enter their 2015 bout with identical league and overall records. To unseat the two-time SSL-Small champions, Mashpee will need continued production from senior running back Deshaun Dias and junior quarterback Nick Carpenter. Dias has already rushed for eight touchdowns and is averaging 158.0 rushing yards a game, scoring twice on the ground and once on a pass from Carpenter against Carver in Week 3. Carpenter also twice found Emmett Sweeney in the end zone last week, and senior WR/CB Dominic Cassell helped out the defense with three tackles and an interception. Hull at Monomoy 7 p.m. at Monomoy Athletic Complex, Harwich Last week: Hull (0-3, 0-1 SSL-Small) lost to Cohasset, 31-7; Monomoy (2-1, 0-0 SSL-Small) beat Cape Tech, 22-8. Last season: Hull beat Monomoy, 33-12. Hull also beat Monomoy twice in 2013. Notes: Of the eight touchdowns the Sharks have scored this season, seven have come from senior quarterback Charles Amaker, sophomore running back Nathan Amaker, or both. The Amaker brothers scored all three touchdowns of Monomoy’s win over Hull, with Nathan rushing for two and catching one from Charles. Nathan also caught two touchdown passes from Charles in Week 2 and one in Week 1. Junior running back Devin Lopes is the only other Monomoy player to breach the end zone, rushing for a touchdown in Week 2. Last year’s loss meant the difference between fourth and fifth in the South Shore League Small. Nauset at Falmouth 7 p.m. at Guv Fuller Field, Falmouth Last week: Nauset (0-3, 0-1 ACL) lost to Sandwich, 27-20; Falmouth (3-0, 0-0 ACL) beat Bishop Feehan, 21-13. Last season: Nauset beat Falmouth, 14-8. Falmouth last beat Nauset in 2009. Notes: Then-sophomore quarterback Travis Van Vleck threw a touchdown pass in the Warriors’ win against the Clippers in 2014, but the two Atlantic Coast League opponents enter tonight’s game in vastly different places. Falmouth has surged to its best start since 2010, mostly on the strength of junior quarterback Nick Couhig, while Nauset is still seeking its first win under new coach Mike Sherman. Couhig rushed for two touchdowns -- including a 66-yarder -- and threw for a third against Bishop Feehan, and this season he’s already rushed for eight touchdowns and completed three touchdown passes to three different receivers. For Nauset, the combination of Van Vleck and senior receiver Sam McGough has produced three touchdown passes, including two in a close loss to Sandwich last week. Nauset junior Akeem Atkinson has also scored in each of the last two games. St. John Paul II at Lowell Catholic 7 p.m. at Cawley Stadium, Lowell Last week: St. John Paul II (2-1 overall, CC-Small) beat Marian, 30-0; Lowell Catholic (1-2, 1-1 CC-Small) lost to St. Clement, 25-6. Last season: St. John Paul II beat Lowell Catholic, 54-20. Notes: Keith Campbell, Cole Campbell, Timmy Jordan and Johnny Warden all caught touchdown passes in 2014, when the Lions blew out the Crusaders to claim the Catholic Conference Small. All four are back this year, with Warden starting at quarterback for the Lions’ first two games but returning to receiver for Week 3. The move seemed to work for everyone, as Devan Harrison completed 19 of 28 passes and 233 yards, three times finding Warden in the end zone. Warden had connected Keith Campbell and Jordan in Week 1 and Cole Campbell twice in Week 2 while also twice rushing for the end zone. Jake Catarius provided the Lions’ fourth touchdown against Marian and twice converted two-point attempts. Dennis-Yarmouth at Sandwich 7 p.m. at DeConto Stadium, East Sandwich Last week: D-Y (1-2, 0-1 ACL) lost to Marshfield, 38-6; Sandwich (2-1, 1-0 ACL) beat Nauset, 27-20. Last season: D-Y beat Sandwich, 28-15. Sandwich last beat D-Y in 2009. Notes: Running back Andrew Jamiel scored twice for the Dolphins last year against Sandwich. Jamiel has seven touchdowns this season already, but five came in Week 1, and Marshfield held Jamiel and the Dolphins’ offense in check throughout their Week 3 game. While D-Y is caught in a quarterback competition between junior Ryan Downs and sophomore Jacob McCarthy, Atlantic Coast League rival Sandwich has gotten consistent production from senior TJ Cairns. Cairns has especially enjoyed targeting senior Jake Carter, the duo connecting for six touchdowns including three last week against Nauset. Cairns also rushed for a touchdown last week, and senior Frank Kelleher -- who scored against D-Y last year -- rushed for one in Week 2. SATURDAY’S GAMES Old Colony at Cape Tech 2 p.m. in Harwich Last week: Old Colony (1-2 overall, MAC-Small) lost to South Shore Voke, 29-28; Cape Tech (0-3) lost to Monomoy, 22-8. Last season: Old Colony beat Cape Tech, 44-28. Old Colony also beat Cape Tech in 2013. Notes: James Criasia scored the Crusaders’ lone touchdown against Monomoy, breaking up a string of four straight touchdowns involving either Shaborne Carter or Tony Berto. Carter’s touchdown reception from Justin Lucas and Berto’s touchdown run served as Cape Tech’s Week 1 scoring, and Berto’s run and Carter’s kickoff-return touchdown served as all the scoring in Week 2. Through three games, Cape Tech is averaging 12.67 points on offense but 28.67 allowed on defense. Upper Cape at West Bridgewater 2:30 p.m. at Bridgewater-Raynham HS in Bridgewater Last week: Upper Cape (2-1, 1-1 MAC-Small) beat Bourne, 40-34. West Bridgewater (3-0, 2-0 MAC-Small). Last season: West Bridgewater beat Upper Cape, 16-14. Upper Cape last beat West Bridgewater in 2012. Notes: Kyle Johnson is coming off a 159-yard, four-touchdown performance against Bourne. He has six total touchdowns this season, scoring at least once in all three Rams games while averaging just over 100 yards per game. Jay Allen has two touchdown runs, split between Week 2 and Week 3, and Tyler Clover also got into the end zone last week. James Abbe has UCT’s lone touchdown reception, off a pass from David Coakley in Week 2. The Wildcats beat the Rams in 2014 and won one more game than UCT overall, but the Rams still finished one spot ahead of West Bridgewater for third in the final Mayflower Small standings. SUNDAY’S GAME Sacred Heart at Nantucket 1:30 p.m. at Vito Capizzo Stadium, Nantucket (postponed from Friday) Last week: Sacred Heart (0-2 overall, MAC-Small) lost to West Bridgewater, 27-0; Nantucket (3-0 overall, MAC-Small) beat Holbrook/Avon, 28-0. Last season: Did not play. This is Sacred Heart’s first year as a varsity football team. Notes: Game moved from Friday night due to impending weather. Junior Travis Demby is coming off a Week 3 game against Holbrook/Avon in which he rushed for 96 yards and scored three times, upping his season total to four. Sophomore Keyshawn Young had the Whalers’ fourth touchdown in Week 3 to help sophomore Jack Holdgate improve to 2-0 as starting quarterback. Defensive standouts from Week 3 included Kyle Frazee and Owen West, who combined for 26 tackles, and Dylan Ray, who recorded an interception. The Fighting Saints, a Mayflower Athletic Conference Small opponent, have given up 57 points and scored just 14 in their first two games as a varsity squad.
