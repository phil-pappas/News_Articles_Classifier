The Royals rolled the rest of the way to a 6-3 victory over Toronto and a 2-0 lead in the AL Championship Series .\n\"We needed to catch a break,\" the Royals' Alex Gordon said, \"and Zobrist's ball was it.\"\nThey proceeded to string together four singles and a double in their go-ahead inning, getting run-producing hits from Gordon, Eric Hosmer , Mike Moustakas and Alex Rios , along with an RBI groundout from Kendrys Morales .\nIt was a monumental collapse for Price, who had at one point recorded 18 straight outs. He fell to 0-7 in seven postseason starts, including a loss to Texas in their AL Division Series.\n\"I gave up hits at the wrong time,\" he said. \"I felt good. It's just a tough loss.\"\nNow, the Blue Jays head home for Game 3 on Monday night in dire trouble. All but three of the previous 25 teams to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven era have won the series â€” though Toronto did rally from the same hole to beat the Rangers in five games in the division round.\nRyan Goins drove in a run off Yordano Ventura in the third, snapping an 18-inning scoreless streak by Royals pitchers. Edwin Encarnacion and Troy Tulowitzki added to the lead in the sixth.\nThe mistake came when Zobrist sent a popup to shallow right to start the seventh, and Goins gave chase from second base and Jose Bautista from right field. Both wound up letting it drop for a single.\n\"I put my glove up and pretty much was saying, 'I'm going to make this play,' and then I didn't make the play,\" Goins said, \"so it's on me.\"", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/53/8809215/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/53/8809215/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T05:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:38:10.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
