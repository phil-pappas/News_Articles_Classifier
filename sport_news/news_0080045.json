The passengers allegedly witnessed him speeding, weaving, swerving, driving off the road and slurring his speech, the Pitkin County Sheriff's Office said at the time. The passengers ordered Maupin to stop the vehicle and one of them drove it back to town, with Maupin then a passenger, and called 911.\nMaupin won't have to serve the 180 days until April 2016 because he told Pitkin County Judge Erin Fernandez-Ely he would lose his job if he couldn't work until the end of March.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:47:13.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
