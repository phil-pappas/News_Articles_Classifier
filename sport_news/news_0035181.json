By 2030, 70 million Americans — one out of every five — will be over 65. Much has been written about the burden in medical services this will place on the economy. Yet only recently has attention been turned in popular media toward the quality of those services and the implications for the end of all our lives. Atul Gawande's recent bestseller \"Being Mortal\" tackles some of these issues; now we have \"The Gift of Caring: Saving Our Parents From the Perils of Modern Healthcare\" by Portland author Marcy Cottrell Houle and Dr. Elizabeth Eckstrom, the director of geriatric services at Oregon Health and Sciences University.\n\"The Gift of Caring\" is a bifurcated narrative. Part is Houle's story of her parents' decline. She follows her father, a former orthopedic surgeon at OHSU, from the first signs of absent-mindedness to full-blown Alzheimer's and several mistakes in treatment through decline and death. She follows her mother through a harrowing series of ailments and challenges with hospitals, nursing facilities, and in-home care providers. Houle's chapters are followed by commentary from Eckstrom, who dissects the medical issues involved and explains what should have been done. Eckstrom comes across as knowledgeable, clear and compassionate — the provider everyone's mother should have.\nYet few of us will find someone similarly informed. Since 1998, the number of geriatricians in the U.S. has dropped by more than 25 percent. Geriatricians are among the lowest-paid physicians yet typically are burdened by large loans. The long consultation time often needed to sort out the multiple issues of the elderly patient isn't compatible with a profit-driven system. Each year fewer medical students take that path.\nThe lesson here is that anyone helping an elderly person navigate the hazards of old age must be as informed and vigilant as possible. Good, integrated care is far from a given. Most doctors receive no training whatsoever in geriatrics, yet the elderly respond differently to drugs than do the young. Often they have multiple conditions managed by separate physicians who do not communicate. Death from drug interactions is the fourth-leading cause of death in the elderly. Temporary delirium may be mistaken, as with Houle's mother, for permanent dementia, with serious consequences. In many hospitals, patients are forbidden to see their own physicians and are seen by \"hospitalists,\" rotating doctors employed by the hospital, burdened by large caseloads.\nDespite their trials, Houle's parents are among the lucky ones, surrounded by a loving family with time to supervise their care and the means to do so. The unspoken shadow in this otherwise excellent book is: What happens to all those elderly without those resources?\nIn fact, this is a book for everyone — if not this moment, then eventually. It will be a book to keep handy when the elderly in your life become frail; and beyond that, when you yourself begin to forget things and wonder if it's the onset of dementia or when the pill bottles begin to gather by the side of your bed. Reading this just might be the best preventative medicine you can find.\nMaya Muir is a Portland writer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:29:24.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
