Jenkins will fly to Snyder, Tex., home of Western Texas College, where he'll suit up this season in hopes of hitting the reset button on his hoops career.\nJenkins, who played for Wings from 2002-06, should get ample opportunity to flourish at Western Texas, an 890-student junior college in a 10,000-resident town.\n\"We really like what Rasheem brings to the floor for us,\" Western Texas coach Mark Berger said. \"He can shoot it and he really pushes the pace.\"\nJenkins, a 5-11 combo guard, averaged 24 points a game and hit a school-record 126 three-pointers, teaming with Andre Tarver and Josh Spivey to lead the small school in the South Bronx to the PSAL semifinals in Madison Square Garden two seasons ago. Jenkins scored 2,146 points in four seasons at Wings.\n\"He was one of the best makers of the three I've ever seen in New York City,\" former Wings coach Tony Bergeron said. \"He was a silent assassin.\"\nJenkins said he had a few offers from Division I schools, including Niagara, but he needed to boost his SAT score in order to gain NCAA eligibility and felt he could boost his basketball stock by attending prep school.\nThe kid known as \"Ra-Ra\" didn't have much to cheer about last season at Laurinburg, where, according to coach Marc Hsu, Jenkins was stuck in a bottleneck of talented guards.\n\"He definitely benefited from the time there, but he was in a tough situation,\" Hsu said at the Rumble in the Bronx summer hoops tournament in late June at Fordham.\n\"I didn't really get better down there,\" Jenkins said. \"The only time I improved was the offseason and the summer.\"\nCLICK TO ENLARGE He briefly considered returning to prep school or waiting on an offer from a four-year school earlier this summer, but Jenkins said the junior college route offers him the best opportunity to get back on the court, which is the bottom line.\nTo ensure he can run with the best at Western Texas, Jenkins has spent the summer playing in local tournaments such as Hoops in the Sun at Orchard Beach and the UDC tournament in Gun Hill.\nHe's been working out five days a week at the court outside of his home at the Edenwall Projects, and playing pickup at Baychester Community Center with college-age ballers such as Seton Hall-bound Mike Glover.\nMostly, Jenkins has been counting down the days until he gets to Western Texas, and so has Berger.\n\"We've been after him for a while,\" Berger said. \"We know he was in a bad situation last season, and that wasn't the Rasheem we know.\"\nHe plans to showcase his skills for two seasons in the school's 1,000-seat arena, and hopes to garner interest from Division I programs.\nBerger said the Western Junior College Athletic Conference will give Jenkins a \"prime opportunity\" to establish his worth.\nPlayers from the WTJCA have gone on to play at Ohio State, Nebraska and Texas in the past few years, Berger said.\nWestern Texas will return eight freshmen from last season, the school's first season in junior college hoops since school officials disbanded the program in 1992-93, and Berger said Jenkins should see significant minutes.\nWestern Texas won nine conference titles and two JUCO national championships before disbanding; Berger believes the program can be great again, with players such as Jenkins leading the way.\nJenkins was considered a Division I point guard before his season on the bench at Laurinburg; the kid from the South Bronx believes he can find that swagger again.\n\"It's an opportunity for me to start over out there,\" Jenkins said. \"I can't wait.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:04:51.897+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
