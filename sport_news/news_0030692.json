Get the defense off the field quickly and get the offense the ball. But it won't be simple to slow down the Jets this weekend. The biggest the reason for that lies in Chris Ivory, a 6-foot, 222-pound bulldozer of a running back. This year, the sixth-year veteran is averaging a league-best 115 yards per game and has rushed for 312 yards in his past two contests. “He’s got some strong upfront guys on the offensive line. That’s where it starts,” Patriots defensive lineman Alan Branch said. “With that said, his skill set at being powerful, quick, fast, and having vision, that’s pretty much gotten him to where he is right now. The guy, he’s a load to take down. He’s always looking for the next cut. You’ve got to be on your P’s and Q’s when it comes to doing your job and stopping him. He’s good at exploiting people who wind up not doing their job or trying to do someone else’s jobs.”“He runs the ball very hard,” added Sealver Siliga. “He’s got great vision, very explosive. He reminds me of Marshawn [Lynch] – the attitude he has running the ball.” The Patriots are used to facing Ivory by now and have seen firsthand how difficult it can be to bring him down. In four career games against New England, Ivory’s averaging 79 yards per game. In two of those games Ivory has gone over 100 yards rushing. He picked up 104 yards on 34 carries in Week Seven of 2013, when the Jets edged the Patriots, 30-27. Last season, also in Week Seven, he carried 21 times for 107 yards and a touchdown as the Patriots barely prevailed, 27-25. In that 2014 game, Ivory's 107 rushing yards came in all different ways. He averaged 4.75 yards a carry running behind the left tackle and 5 yards running behind the left guard. When he ran behind the right guard, he averaged 4.5 yards an attempt. He did the most damage running behind the right tackle, where he gained 50 yards on 10 attempts. The Patriots kept him in check when he ran right up the middle behind the center (1.9 yards a carry), but that’s also how he scored his touchdown. This week, Patriots gave a lot of the credit to the Jets’ offensive line for creating holes. Ivory is the type of runner who is hard to stop once he hits a hole. “The run game is where they start, their offensive line – to give credit to them – they’re doing a great job up front blocking and creating holes,” said Patriots defensive coordinator Matt Patricia. “Ivory runs extremely hard, he comes downhill, he’s very fast, he’s got great speed to the edge, he can get open in space, he makes a lot of guys miss tackles, so it doesn’t take much for him to get through the line of scrimmage and burst into that second level and really hit that third level pretty fast. It really starts for them with the run game, which then has kind of opened up the passing game.”“It’s more about preparing for their o-line. They do a great job of opening holes for him,” added Siliga. “He does a great job of complementing the holes that they open, finding them and bursting through them.” Opposing running backs are averaging 4.9 yards a carry against the Pats, which is tied for the third-worst mark in the NFL. Last weekend, New England struggled to keep Frank Gore (78 yards on 13 carries) in check. Despite the challenge that Ivory represents, Branch and Siliga said they’re both looking forward to the matchup. “Yeah. I love it,” Branch said. “Any team that likes to run the ball, I really enjoy just for the fact that, you know, what I like to do. I fancy myself a run stopper. Just having an opportunity to play against these teams is ideal for me.”“I’m pretty excited to play against Ivory because I know he’s a great back,” Siliga added. “He has good attitude. He’s the type of back that you want on your team, just his attitude with the way he runs the ball.” By Mark Daniels", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:55:34.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
