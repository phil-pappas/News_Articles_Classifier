By global reach and by budget – more than $50 million – it is the biggest ad campaign in the company's history, a Columbia spokesperson said. It was introduced at an event for fashion writers and others in New York City.\nTelevision spots begin airing Friday featuring Gert Boyle, the 91-year-old matriarch of the 77-year-old company. A billboard featuring Boyle is slated to appear at Portland International Airport on Friday with another set for Monday on West Burnside Street.\nColumbia executives hope the ads resonate more with consumers compared with what's been offered the past decade, Columbia chief marketing officer Stuart Redsun said in an interview with The Oregonian/OregonLive.\n\"The majority of them over the last six or seven years were about specific products or technology that had little to do with the emotional side of the Columbia brand,\" said Redsun, a one-time Nike and Under Armour marketing employee who has a University of Oregon journalism degree. \"We will still talk about features and tech but they all will be under the lens of this brand umbrella which we called 'Tested Tough.'\"\nThe slogan will figure prominently in ads and shopping bags as well in #TestedTough tagging on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. On top of that, digital ads this fall will be targeted to geographical markets based on those markets' weather.\nWhile Boyle will be the prominent face of the global campaign, Columbia employees will be posting YouTube videos of their own, following the \"TestedTough\" theme. And while he is welcome to post his own YouTube video – perhaps while hunting or fishing? – Columbia chief executive Tim Boyle will not be part of the latest ad campaign.\nIn addition, two Directors of Toughness have been hired to put the slogan to work – through testing of Columbia products – over the next six months.\nLauren Steele and Zach Doleac were selected from among more than 3,000 applicants for the position that is expected as transport the directors around the world testing Columbia clothes and footwear. In addition to having a resume deep in outdoor adventure, Columbia selected the pair because of their comfort with writing, photography, videography and social media. They will maintain a blog.\nSteele, 22, grew up on a Kirksville, Missouri farm and is University of Missouri School of Journalism graduate, freelancing for Outside, Men's Journal, Men's Fitness, Rolling Stone and New York Magazine. \"She lives knowing that life is comprised of many stories. Chasing those stories from the Atacama Desert in Chile to the Mont Blanc Massif geared her up for her latest gig as Columbia Sportswear's Director of Toughness,\" Columbia's bio says.\nDoleac, 25, until recently was global team manager, marketing coordinator, and photographer for K2 Skis of Seattle-based K2 Sports USA. Doleac grew up in the Seattle area, became an Eagle Scout at 15 and played football and baseball at Middlebury College in Vermont. \"In the past year, he has been backpacking in Kauai, surfing in Central America, skiing all over the western United States, mountain biking in the Cascades, and climbing in the Tetons,\" his Columbia bio says.\nSteele and Doleac, in an interview with The Oregonian/OregonLive, admitted their outdoor gear closets were thin on Columbia products before getting the Toughness gig. That's changed, of course, since their selection about two weeks ago.\nThey will make an appearance Monday on ABC's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live.\"\nThe global adventure begins after that.\n\"We're pretty much in the dark,\" about destinations, Doleac said in the phone interview. \"It's going to be some cold places. It's going to be some hot places. Other than that, any specifics are unknown to me at this time.\"\n--Allan Brettman\nabrettman@oregonian.com\n503-294-5900\n@ allanbrettman", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/allanbrettman", "http://www.north.com/"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:15:54.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
