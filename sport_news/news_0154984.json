Any fan of the sport at Belfast Area High School would attest to that. \nNow, fans of Husson University can definitively say the same. \nMellor, a senior forward for the Eagles, was named the North Atlantic Conference player of the week, the league office announced on Monday, Sept. 28. \nMellor, a psychology major, compiled five points (2 goals, assist) in Husson's 7-2 win over Colby-Sawyer College of New London, N.H. on Saturday, Sept. 26. \nThe 21-year-old Mellor, a Belfast native, has a team-leading three goals and one assist this season. It is the first time Mellor has received the award. \n“I'm actually really excited and I wasn't expecting it at all,” she said. “There was a lot of competition for that this past week, so I was really shocked that I got honored with it.” \nThe Eagles are 2-5 on the campaign, but are coming off a season where they won the NAC championship — a 1-0 victory over the University of Maine at Farmington — where Mellor scored the game-winning goal in double-overtime. \n“We were almost all the way through our second overtime and my teammate had drawn the goalie and passed it out wide to me,” said Mellor of her championship-clinching score. “I was just thinking to myself, 'Please don't miss this! Please don't miss this!' It was a wide-open shot and I made it. I was just really stunned and shocked and excited at the same time.” \nMellor played in 15 games as a junior and logged a goal and two assists (4 points), four goals and two assists (10 points) in 18 games as a sophomore and three goals (6 points) in 20 games as a freshman. \nMellor toiled in the midfield in her first two seasons with the Eagles, while she moved up to forward last season and remains in that role this fall. \nOften the jump from high school sports to the collegiate rank can be a difficult one. For Mellor, it was not. In fact, it was \"quite simple.\" \n“Everyone is at your level or better,” she said. “It's not like in high school where everyone is at like sporadic levels. In order to be a collegiate athlete, everyone is at a specific level and from there you just build.” \nThe Eagles are a home-grown team, with 21 of 26 players coming from the Pine Tree State. \nSome of those players come from rival schools of Belfast, such as Austyn Thomas of Mount View High School, or Taylor Lovely and Taylor Shaw of Nokomis. \n“You walk into the team not liking them because you have this rivalry with them,” said Mellor. “But then you get to know them and they're actually really good people and they're really fun to play with.” \nMellor, a 2012 BAHS graduate, was a sensational four-year player for Belfast and led the Lions to the state Class B crown in 2011. Mellor scored one of the team's two goals in a 2-1 state title-clinching win over York. \nPrior to that, in the regional final, Belfast beat Nokomis 1-0 in double-overtime. \nCourier Publications' sports staff can be reached by email at sports@villagesoup.com or by phone at 594-4401.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:05:38.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
