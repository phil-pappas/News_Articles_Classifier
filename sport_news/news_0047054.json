The Saints (4-0 overall and 3-0 in league), busted open an 8-8 game with 44 points to end the first half. “Elbert came out and played well,” Saints coach Tim Pierson said. “It was their senior night and they gave us everything they had. Offensively, I was pleased with what we did. Defensively, they caught us off guard with a long pass before we settled in. It’s a long trip. We did well and got out of here with a win.” Quarterback Logan Raitt put the Saints on the board with a 29-yard run. The host Bulldogs sprang their pass play to tie it at eight. Then, the Saints got rolling. Ethan Kuhns rumbled in from five yards out. Raitt to Alex Davis for 39 yards pushed the Saints’ lead to 22-8. Davis ran wild in the second quarter with scoring runs of 5, 21 and 5 yards. Give a big nod to the beef up front for opening the holes. That’s Riley Spear, Ryan Hethcote, Keaghen Mullin and Johnny Barron. Raitt to David Caballero for 10 yards sent the Saints into the locker room, leading 52-8. Kuhns added his second touchdown of the night in the second half. On defense, Caballero had a pick and Kuhns nabbed a fumble. Raitt was 7-for-9 passing for 152 yards and two touchdowns. He also carried the ball eight times for another 117 yards. Caleb Chicoine ran for 124 yards on 15 carries. Vail Christian heads to Gilpin County on Saturday for what should be a challenge. The Eagles can score, having piled up 140 points in just four games. “Gilpin is very improved,” Pierson said. “Their quarterback has rushed for 700 yards. They have a good running back. They can put some points up.” Saints spikers get big win EDWARDS — The Saints were 2-for-2 on Friday as the Vail Christian volleyball team came though with a big win against West Grand, 23-25, 25-19, 25-17, 27-25, in Edwards on Friday night. Both teams entered with undefeated marks in Gore League play, so the Saints (10-0 overall and 7-0 in the Gore) sit atop the standings. Taylor Alexander led the way with 18 kills, followed by Ciara Heiden, (12) and Brittney Bossow (seven). Julia Vlaar, Emma Janusz and Alexander combined for 44 digs. “It was a great match,” Saints coach Cathy Alexander said. “(West Grand) has big hitters all around, and our girls stepped up after the loss in the first set. It was one of those really fun matches to watch. We played with six seniors, while they didn’t have any, and our maturity really helped.” Sports Editor Chris Freud can be reached at 970-748-2934, cfreud@vaildaily.com and @cfreud.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:02:52.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
