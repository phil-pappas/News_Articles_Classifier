Posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 10:42 am | Updated: 3:31 pm, Tue Oct 13, 2015. Grande Gridiron Report, 10/13/15 Sports Editor Ed Petruska Casa Grande Valley Newspapers Inc. Sports Editor Ed Petruska reviews Friday night’s Casa Grande Union and Vista Grande football games. Casa Grande Union The Cougars gave a up a 53-yard field goal with no time remaining in the first half, which was prolonged by a 15-yard hands-to-the-face penalty, then allowed Coronado to tie the score 25-25 after a pass interference penalty wiped out a 52-yard interception return touchdown by Garrett Thomas on the opening series of the second half. Instead of being rattled, CG Union responded with a seven-play 80-yard TD march, a defensive stop and a seven-play, 70-yard touchdown drive to take a 13-point lead in what became a 38-31 victory over the Dons on Friday night. “The kids kept their composure and their focus,” CG Union coach Jake Barro said. “They’ve done that all year no matter what the situation is.” At 6-1 overall and 2-0 in Division IV/Section 5, the No. 14 Cougars impressively passed their first real test since a 23-12 loss to Vista Grande in the opener. No. 13 Coronado (5-2, 1-1 section) also entered the game with a five-game winning streak. The Dons netted 398 total yards, including 324 passing, against CG Union but could not overcome four turnovers. The Cougars finished with 454 total yards “against one of the most athletic defenses we’re going to see,” Barro said. Brock Hall passed for four TDs and 278 yards, but the Cougars also had an effective running game. Trenton Diaz gained 128 yards on 20 carries as CG Union rushed for 176 yards. “The offensive line is coming into its own,” Barro said. “Their technique is getting better and they’re able to move the guys across from them.” Hall’s savvy is the other big reason the running game is on the upswing, Barro said. “He sees where the defense is lined up and has done a great job of checking off, recognizing where to find the weak link and expose it,” he said. Hall, a 6-foot-4, 185-pound junior, already has drawn interest from the University of Michigan. Barro received an email last week from the school requesting video of Hall along with his athletic and academic portfolios. He already has thrown for 1,933 yards to surpass the single-season school record of 1,857 he set year, and his 23 TD passes are tied with Jon Roberts (1997) for the most in one season. Diaz surpassed 100 yards for the second straight game (he gained 117 against Fountain Hills). His 4-yard TD run capped an 11-play, 71-yard drive and gave the Cougars a 19-14 lead with 3:57 left in the second quarter. Trevor Russell had over 100 yards receiving for the fifth time, catching six passes for 145 yards. He had an 80-yard reception for CG Union’s first touchdown and a 1-yard TD catch to put the Cougars up 13-7. Cameron Gardner had touchdown catches of 22 and 19 yards, and Hunter Bechtel’s 13-yard TD run wound up being the difference after Coronado scored with 2:33 remaining. -- DEFENSE: Coronado became the first team to gain 300 total yards against the Cougars, and the Dons’ point total was a season high for an opponent. Going in, CG Union was allowing 181 total yards and 10.7 points. “Shutting people down is going to be tough” for the rest of the season, Barro said, because the quality of competition is getting better. Still, “I thought our defense played well. We had trouble getting to the quarterback but we were able to shut down the run pretty well (Coronado had 74 rushing yards) and when we needed a big stop, we came up with it.” Coronado’s first series ended with a fumble recovery by Thomas on the game’s second play from scrimmage. Armando Pinon and Caleb Ramirez had first-half interceptions, the latter leading to a touchdown that put the Cougars up 25-14 with 48 seconds left in the second quarter. Russell’s interception with 9:03 remaining preserved CG Union’s 38-25 lead. The Cougars have forced 19 turnovers on the season and are plus-nine in that category. James Dodd had a sack, and R.J. Ibarra had a tackle for loss. -- SPECIAL TEAMS: The Cougars went 2 for 5 on extra-point kicks and were unsuccessful on a two-point conversion pass. … Hall averaged 39.0 yards on four punts, with a long of 45. Vista Grande Tempe controlled the clock in Friday night’s 12-7 victory over the Spartans, doing just enough on offense to pull off a second consecutive upset. Coming off a 21-14 win over No. 13 Arcadia the previous week, the Buffaloes ran 59 plays to Vista Grande’s 46. Tempe took a 10-0 lead in the first half on a 30-yard field goal and an 18-yard touchdown pass, then tacked on a safety in the final minute after the No. 9 Spartans (5-2, 1-2 Division III/Section 1) closed within 10-7 on a 1-yard TD run by Daniel Padilla with 5:40 to play. Tempe (3-4, 2-1 section) averaged just 3.3 yards per play in netting 192 total yards, 6 fewer than Vista Grande’s defense was allowing going in. But the Buffaloes prolonged their first-half drives by converting several times on third down. “We just couldn’t get the ball away from them in the first half,” Vista Grande coach Tracy Stuart said. The Spartans struggled to find an offensive rhythm. They were limited to nine first downs and a season-low 141 total yards after netting 300-plus in each of their previous three games. Vista Grande completed just 3 of 15 passes for 37 yards. “They covered well in the secondary, and (6-foot-4, 225-pound defensive end My-King Johnson) was in the quarterback’s face all night long,” Stuart said. The pressure (Johnson had two sacks) prevented Sam Barragon from going through his normal progressions. Bryant Henderson replaced Barragon to “give us a spark with his scrambling ability,” Stuart said, and he ran for 32 yards on Vista Grande’s seven-play, 56-yard scoring drive. “We moved the ball at times, but not with any consistency,” Stuart said. The Spartans were minus three starters — offensive lineman Alex Soto (broken foot), running back/defensive back Jerron Johnson (bruised shin) and defensive lineman Elonna Okuagu (turf toe) — which didn’t help matters. “But give credit to Tempe,” Stuart said. “They came in with a great game plan, and they took things away from us.” With three games remaining in the regular season, the Spartans still control their postseason destiny. They have road games against Arcadia (5-2, 2-1) and No. 3 Maricopa (6-1, 3-1) before closing at home against Apache Junction (2-5, 2-1). “It’s nice that we control our own destiny, but (Division III) is extremely competitive,” Stuart said. “We knew going into the season that every Friday would be a challenge.” -- DEFENSE: After the Buffaloes scored on their first two series, the Spartans pretty much stopped them in their tracks. Six punts followed Tempe’s opening drive of 67 yards that consumed 6 minutes, 21 seconds and ended with the field goal, and a 98-yard TD drive on its next possession that lasted 16 plays. The Buffaloes ran for 81 yards on 36 attempts (2.3 average) and completed 12 of 23 passes for 111 yards. Adrian Leos and Deandre Walker each had one sack, and Luis Palacios had two tackles for loss as the Spartans held an opponent under 15 points for the sixth time in seven games. -- SPECIAL TEAMS: Art Ruiz converted on the extra-point kick for Vista Grande and is 10 for 11 on the season. ….
