One more time I say thank you very much. I love you.\"ATK co-owners Sourav Ganguly, Sanjiv Goenka, Utsav Parekh and Neotia presented the 74-year-old an autographed jersey and an overwhelmed Pele said: \"Thank you very much for this reception.

It's a sporting mad city be it cricket or football. It will not change. I am sure you have fond memories of the reception 38 years ago,\" Ganguly told Pele.\"I could not see you live in action. I've seen you only in videos but it's an unbelievable sight to watch your skills on the field.\"Cricket has not gone into Brazil but I've been through the life of a sportsman. To see so much of appeal, speak volumes of your achievement. For all of us, it's the respect that matters and will live forever.\"When I was young, I saw a movie about Pele and now I'm getting to see the giant close. It's so special. I've been an avid football fan and watched him play.\"Goenka said, \"This is a historic visit. All of us welcome the living legend individually.\"Remembering the 1977 visit, Neotia said he had seen him with his father whose travel agency was associated with tour. \"My father was so excited to see him and I realised how great a player he was.\"For Parekh it was like a dream come true to sit next to Pele. \"I see my dream coming into reality. I always dreamt of meeting you and today I'm sitting next to you. My dream is more than realised.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:37:43.430+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
