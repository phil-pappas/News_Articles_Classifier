He had some good luck with short contracts to aging veterans Mike Napoli, Gomes, Shane Victorino, Ryan Dempster and David Ross. The Red Sox offense drove up pitch counts and tugged on their beards.\nEvery other team in baseball wanted to copy them.\nAs David Price takes the mound for the Blue Jays today, officially kicking off the American League Division Series, Toronto’s crafty general manager, Alex Anthopoulos, will undoubtedly be getting the praise Cherington was showered with two years ago.\nHe has assembled the team most experts consider to be World Series favorites by channeling his inner George Steinbrenner, building the majority of his team with players acquired via trades. Only two of Toronto’s 10 players this season (as judged by WAR values on Baseball-reference.com), have been homegrown: Ryan Goins and Kevin Pillar.\nTwo were free agents: Edwin Encarnacion and Russell Martin.\nAnd the other six — Josh Donaldson, Jose Bautista, Marco Estrada, Devon Travis, Price and R.A. Dickey — were acquired in trades.\nThey also added Price at the trade deadline.\nAnd the Jays had the best offense in baseball with an MLB-best 1.4 home runs per game.\nAll of this makes Toronto the heavy favorite in the AL.\nHere’s a quick look at each of the league’s four playoff teams and how they could punch their ticket to the World Series:\n•     BLUE JAYS (93-69)\nHow they can win it: One problem with a team that just snapped a 21-year playoff drought is that most of their players have yet to be tested in the postseason environment. Arguably, their two most important players, Donaldson (.233 postseason average) and Price (4.50 postseason ERA), haven’t performed in their few October chances. But with a roster that one Red Sox executive recently called the best in the American League, if they perform as they have all year, the Jays will be tough to beat.\n•     ROYALS (95-67)\nHow they can win it: The Royals have virtually the same roster they had last season, when they rode a strong bullpen and scrappy offense to the seventh game of the World Series before falling to the Giants. Johnny Cueto will need to be better than his 4.76 ERA with the Royals suggests, but if Lorenzo Cain & Co. can put a few runs on the board early, the Kansas City relief corps could shorten games for the second straight postseason.\n•     ASTROS (86-76)\nHow they can win it: Dallas Keuchel brought back memories of last year’s World Series hero, Madison Bumgarner, with his gritty, dominant performance in the Wild Card game against the Yankees on Tuesday night, shutting down New York’s aging lineup on just three days rest. As long as their boom-or-bust offense doesn’t run into a shutdown pitcher, the Astros have the ace to go deep into October.\n•     RANGERS (88-74)\nHow they can win it: Few expected the Rangers to be still be alive, but with a lineup that can provide a threat from the first batter to the ninth, Texas could be the team nobody wants to face. Cole Hamels is a proven postseason performer (3.09 ERA) and few players are better this time of year than Adrian Beltre (.354 batting average since Sept. 1). If the bullpen can hold a lead, the Rangers have a shot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:20:28.549+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
