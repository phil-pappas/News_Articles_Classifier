The post tells the hauntingly beautiful, seemingly too-beautiful-to-be-true story of a chance meeting in Boston on New Year’s Eve. The person who posted it wrote that the encounter saved his life.\nHe wrote that after serving in Vietnam, he found himself “in a barren studio apartment on Beacon and Hereford with a fifth of Tennessee rye and the pang of shame permeating the recesses of my soul.”\n He took a walk, he said, wandering through the whole city: around Fenway, past Symphony Hall, through the Common, and down to the waterfront. Then, in a scene so perfect it seems scripted, it started to rain, and that’s when he saw her:\nYou’d taken shelter under the balcony of the Old State House. You were wearing a teal ball gown, which appeared to me both regal and ridiculous. Your brown hair was matted to the right side of your face, and a galaxy of freckles dusted your shoulders. I’d never seen anything so beautiful.\nWhen I joined you under the balcony, you looked at me with your big green eyes, and I could tell that you’d been crying. I asked if you were OK. You said you’d been better. I asked if you’d like to have a cup of coffee. You said only if I would join you.\nThe two spent the afternoon talking “like old friends,” but as quickly as she appeared, she was gone, without leaving her name or number, he wrote.\nAfter their encounter, he didn’t kill himself that night. It’s now 42 years later, and he never stopped wondering about her.\n“You’re with me still.”\nThe person who posted the Craigslist ad didn’t respond to a request for comment, so this Boston fairy tale might be exactly that.
