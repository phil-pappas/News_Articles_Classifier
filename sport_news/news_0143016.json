Then Bulldogs defensive end Efrain Gonzalez intercepted a pass from Sultana quarterback Dominick Cortez and raced 30 yards to the end zone to break the scoreless tie. It was all Oak Hills from there in a 40-0 win. “I thought that our defense did a good job after the way Sultana opened the game with that long march to our red zone,” Oak Hills head coach Robert Kistner said. “Then we settled down and our offense came through after the interception to play some good football. Our pass protection was excellent.” The Bulldogs (3-5, 2-1 Mojave River League) scored three more touchdowns in the second quarter. Their next score came after a Sultana (4-5, 0-3 MRL) three-and-out as Brandon Porter connected with Noah Metzger for 35 yards. Sultana went three-and-out again. On the first play of the Bulldogs’ drive Porter found Aramis Aldredge, who outmaneuvered a pair of Sultana defensive backs and raced 60 yards to score. The final touchdown of the first half came on a 4-yard run by J.J. Lewis, completing a 75-yard drive in 10 plays. In the third quarter, Oak Hills took the kickoff and marched 65 yards in five plays as Porter hooked up with Aldredge for the second time with a 33-yard score. That extended the Bulldogs’ lead to 33-0. The final score came with 5:29 left in the third quarter on a 10-yard pass from Porter to Jeremiah Lorick. The Bulldogs held Sultana to just eight first downs in the game. Sultana completed only 2 of 12 passes for 8 yards. The Sultans found a bit more success on the ground, rushing for 100 yards on 21 carries. Phillip Taylor had 60 of those yards. Porter was 16 of 23 for 271 yards. On the ground the Bulldogs gained 87 yard on 21 plays. Aldredge led the way with 10 carries for 41 yards.
