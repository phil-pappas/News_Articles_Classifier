(Courtesy of Jean Fogelberg)\nWhen Anne Hillerman was a child, the nightly go-to-sleep ritual included a bedtime story that her dad told her and her siblings. Her dad was the much-honored and prolific New Mexico mystery writer Tony Hillerman, who died in 2008.\n“He created them as serials, so the adventure continued. And my siblings and I were always the heroes,” Hillerman said. “Everyone likes stories. … Our narrative has to do with stories.”\n“Why Stories Matter” is the subject of her talk Thursday at the University of New Mexico’s George Pearl Hall. The talk is the sixth annual Rudolfo and Patricia Anaya Lecture.\nHillerman said she will talk about how stories were important to her and to her dad as they grew up to become writers. Writers, she said, should feel honored, and responsible, to select which stories to share with the relevant details.\nIf you go\nWHAT: Anne Hillerman lecture: “Why Stories Matter”\nWHEN: 7 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 22. Reception to follow\nWHERE: George Pearl Hall Auditorium, School of Architecture and Planning, UNM main campus\nHOW MUCH: Free Hillerman has followed in her father’s footsteps, first as a journalist and in recent years as a mystery writer. Her debut novel, “Spider Woman’s Daughter” received the Western Writers of America 2014 Spur Award for Best First Mystery.\nHer second novel, also set on the Navajo reservation, was “Rock with Wings.” She is currently working on the manuscript of a third novel in the series.\nIn her lecture, she also will talk about Chaco Canyon “as a place of amazing real-life mysteries and how my dad used Chaco Canyon to move his career from being a regional writer to a national writer.”\nShe was referring to Chaco’s ruins inspiring her father in researching his 1988 novel “A Thief of Time,” which widened his readership.\n“I reread it when I was writing ‘Spider Woman’s Daughter.’ Rereading it and physically going to Chaco Canyon, and spending some time there, partly because of the magnificence of the scenes and the deep history and the space and quiet of the place. It’s a great spot to collect your thoughts,” Hillerman said.\nPrevious speakers in the Anaya lecture series have included Acoma Pueblo poet Simon Ortiz, Taos writer John Nichols and Las Cruces author Denise Chavez. The series is organized by the UNM English Department.\nHillerman said she also will discuss research she read about that concluded reading fiction is good for the brain. “It develops new brain paths, new energy, (better) empathy,” she said.\nHillerman’s lecture occurs as UNM is launching its Tony Hillerman Portal at ehillerman.unm.edu. It is a research and teaching tool that makes available online his archival collections.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/life10_jd_18oct_hillerman-640x464.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:38:02.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
