They also collect donations from hotels and restaurants that are renewing their stock of bedding or dishware.\nHow to help\nTo donate to Gift Givers Anonymous, call Kalei Heartland at 504-5222 to arrange a pick-up or email her at kheartland@smhc-nm.org . All of those items are channeled to people in need.\n“I think of it like this spider’s web connecting the community,” she said. “If we don’t work collaboratively together we are not going to have an overall impact on homelessness or those that are struggling. That’s kind of the vision. We are all interconnected.”\nHeartland’s nonprofit Gift Givers Anonymous formed a partnership this year with St. Martin’s Hospitality Center, which provides services for more than 4,000 homeless clients annually.\nThrough that partnership she has created a clearing house where organizations that help those who have been in jail, are homeless or suffer from mental illness pay an annual membership fee that enables them to send clients to pick out household goods from the Gift Givers Anonymous “money free store.”\n“It’s wonderful for them to be able to go to a place that’s dignified to find things like plates, dishes, sheets, towels and furniture,” said St. Martin’s Associate Executive Director Vicky Palmer.\nGift Givers Anonymous founder Kalei Heartland and volunteers Carla Furry and Jim Rydberg sort through household items from an estate sale that will be made available to local organizations who have clients who are in need. Volunteers will pick up unsold items from garage and estate sales, hotels and restaurants that are replacing bedding and tableware. (Adolphe Pierre-Louis/Albuquerque Journal)\nThe clearinghouse now has 10 membership organizations, including Cuidando Los Niños, Wings for L.I.F.E. and Bernalillo County Supportive Housing Program, which helps individuals who have been incarcerated and their families.\nIt operates out of two storage units near Lomas and Adams in the Northeast Heights. One unit serves as a holding area where volunteers sort through donations, the other is the “store” where plates, cups, bowls, silverware, bedding and small furniture items are labeled on display shelves.\nSpace is cramped, so Gift Givers has a website where they can alert member organizations when they receive large pieces like beds or couches that are much in demand.\n“They’re typically gone within hours,” Heartland said.\nFor the smaller items, case managers will bring clients to the shop site. Jeremiah Lovato, intake coordinator with the Bernalillo County program, visited recently with Crystal DeLeon, who was looking to furnish the apartment the agency found for her.\n“I’m starting from zero. I’m getting my life back together,” said DeLeon. She browsed excitedly among the shelves picking out plates, cups, a coffee mug, bedding and bakeware.\nGift Givers Anonymous also helps animals in need. Donations of towels and bedding that may not be suitable for humans go to Animal Humane New Mexico.\nGift Givers Anonymous volunteer Jane Allen loads household items into a trailer after a pick-up at an estate sale. (Adolphe Pierre-Louis/Albuquerque Journal)\nThe clearinghouse is a boon to businesses, too.\nBeverly Hubbard, owner of Estate Sales by Wings, has collaborated with Heartland for several years.\n“It’s worked out great for us,” said Hubbard, “Everything that we give them they find a home for. That’s a really great thing for us to do for our clients as well.”\nVick’s Vittles Country Kitchen owner Robert Vick recently donated dishes and silverware that came from the Nendels Inn, a hotel next to his restaurant on Central that he bought and demolished to make room to expand his own business.\nMore recently, Heartland said, the Olive Garden restaurant on Juan Tabo donated 40 boxes of dishes when it was renewing its stock.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/life14_jd_18oct_5giver-400x281.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/life14_jd_18oct_4giver-400x267.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:36:59.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
