And then, it's being able to apply it. And so, I haven't had a chance to apply that, so no one knows.\"\nRipken said that he’d “answer the phone” if the Nationals called to talk about their managerial opening. The 19-time All-Star seems eager to prove that he has what it takes to run a team, despite not having done it before.\n\"So that would be a risk, I suppose. But I'm in the business world now and all the time, it seems like I'm asking for experts to come around and tell me what to do because I don't have that background to fall back on. But in baseball, I have that background to fall back on and I would know how to deal with whatever situations there because I've seen it.\"\nThe Nationals are looking for a replacement for Matt Williams who was fired after compiling a 179-145 record in two seasons. Ripken has said he had \" serious discussions \" with Washington general manager Mike Rizzo before Williams was hired two years ago.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/orioles/blog/bal-cal-ripken-jr-on-nationals-managerial-opening-id-answer-the-phone-20151009-story.html", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657256-matt-williams-manager-replacement-washington-nationals-cal-ripken-bud-black-baker", "http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2015-08-20/cal-ripken-jr-washington-nationals-manager-mike-rizzo-matt-williams", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657714-mariners-manager-replacements-lloyd-mcclendon-dipoto-bogar", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:53:14.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
