Watson/Getty Images) The Aztecs may have gotten some of their mojo back with their third straight win. The Aztecs defeated San Jose State 30-7 in a true team effort. Junior running back Donnel Pumphrey struck first with a 13-yard touchdown run in the first quarter. His touchdown and 152 rushing yards helped him climbed the ranks in the SDSU record books. Pumphrey moved up to up to second on the all-time rushing list with 3,348 on his career. His touchdown brought his career rushing touchdown total to 36 and tied him for second. The Aztecs all but sealed the deal in the third quarter with back to back interceptions, both resulted in points for the Aztecs. SDSU's defense contained Spartan stand out running back, Tyler Ervin to just 22 yards. They held the team to 148 total yards, compared to the Aztecs 377. Calvin Munson finished with four tackles for a loss which is the most for an Aztec since Miles Burris in 2010. Senior Quarterback Maxwell Smith has started to find his groove with his new team. He completed 10/14 passes for a total 144 yards and a touchdown. The Aztecs move to 4-3 on the season and 3-0 in conference play. The win puts them at the top their division. Next week they host the other Mountain West Division leaders Utah State at Qualcomm Stadium.
