The kickoff was delayed because of lightning. \nBut it was sophomore Clayton Scott who provided the spark. \nThe Millville High School football team finally found its running attack in a 22-6 road win over Absegami on a rain-soaked Friday night in a game that was delayed 30 minutes at the start. \nScott had a breakout performance, running the ball 22 times for 180 yards and two touchdowns in the win. Will Polhamus eventually found his rhythm and passed for 167 yards, but did throw three interceptions in the rain. \n\"(Scott) was real big for us,\" Millville head coach Dennis Thomas said. \"Whenever you have a back rush for 100 yards, I think that’s great. It makes us dynamic on the ground and in the air. He did a phenomenal job. He had some big runs called back too. He was real big for us. Whenever you have a back rush for 100 yards, I think that’s great. It makes us dynamic on the ground and in the air. He did a phenomenal job. He had some big runs called back too.\" \nWith the win, Millville improved to 2-2 on the season and picked up its first victory since Week 1 against Mainland. Before last week’s bye, the Thunderbolts lost in consecutive weeks to St. Augustine and St. Joseph. \nIn the second half, the Braves had a few chances to score, but the Millville defense held them out of the end zone and held them to zero points in the half. \nWhile Scott did the heavy lifting on offense, the Millville defense was against impenetrable on Friday night. The Thunderbolts shut down the run and didn’t let a somewhat deadly Absegami passing attack do anything in the rainy conditions. \nThe Millville defense held Absegami quarterback Andrew Marcucci to 12-of-31 passing for 94 yards and four interceptions. The Braves finished with just 73 yards of total offense. \n\"(The defense) was huge,\" Thomas said. \"Whenever your defense can hold them under 100 yards of offense, that’s championship football.\" \nAbsegami (2-2) got on the board first when defensive back Jerry Brietzman picked off a wild Will Polhamus pass and returned it 85 yards for a touchdown. After a failed extra point, Absegami had a 6-0 lead, which it took into the second quarter. \nThat interception came after Millville found early success running the ball with Scott on its first possession. \nThe Thunderbolts made sure to go back to Scott in the second quarter and it gave them a 15-6 lead at halftime. \nScott started off the Millville scoring with a 28-yard touchdown run early in the second quarter. On that scoring drive, he accounted for all 42 yards. Zack Douglas threw the ball to Ryant Harris for the two-point conversion to make the score 8-6. \nAfter the two teams exchanged a few more scoreless possessions, Millville got the ball on its own 25-yard line. After a penalty of eight yards and a pass of eight yards, Scott broke off a 75-yard touchdown run. Douglas’ extra point sailed through the uprights to give the Thunderbolts a nine-point lead at halftime. \nScott had 145 yards and two touchdowns in the first half. \nThe only Absegami points at half came on defense. Millville’s defense actually had Absegami in the red in the first half, with minus-4 yards. \nThe Braves will travel next Friday to face St. Augustine, which is considered one of the best teams in South Jersey. Meanwhile, Millville will be on the road to face Ocean City next Friday night. \nMillville 22, Absegami 6 \nMillville (2-2) 0 15 7 0 — 22 \nAbsegami (2-2) 6 0 0 0 — 6 \nScoring \nA: Brietzman 85 interception return (kick failed) \nM: Scott 28 run (Douglas pass to Harris) \nM: Scott 75 run (Douglas kick) \nM: Polhamus 1 run (Douglas kick) \nTeam stats Millville Absegami", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:59:09.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
