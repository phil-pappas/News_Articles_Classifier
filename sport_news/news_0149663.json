DeMaine Riley added two rushing touchdowns on runs of 33 and 4 yards, the 33-yard touchdown coming in the first half to contribute to the 39-0 lead at halftime. The second half was played with a running clock, stopping only for injuries. \nThe Tigers spread the rushing load throughout eight players, led by Jenkins’ 102 yards on six carries. Riley ran four times for 41 yards, Five more Tigers got two or more carries: Azzari Pleas three times for 37 yards, Payton Batteford twice for 33 yards, Jaiden Cole twice for 19 yards, Christopher Haynes twice for 12 yards and Kenneth Johnson twice for three yards. \nThe defense held Grant’s double wing offense to 71 total yards, less than one yard per play. \n“That type of offense is built and designed for ball control offense,” Neville head coach Mickey McCarty said. “I’m really proud of the defense. Any time we’re able to pitch a shutout, that’s big. We’re proud of the preparation of our staff and our kids getting ready, coming out and performing.” \nSpecial teams scores: Neville’s punt return team produced two back-to-back scores in the second quarter to help put the game out of reach. Corey Straughter returned for 64 yards and a touchdown to put Neville up 29-0, then five plays later, the Tigers blocked a punt that Kenderick Marbles picked up and dove into the end zone to score. \nComing up: Neville plays its final home game of the regular season next week against Tioga before going on the road to West Ouachita and Franklin Parish to end the regular season. \nFollow Brett on Twitter, @BHudsonTNS.
