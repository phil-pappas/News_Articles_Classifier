His primary responsibility is to better himself in order to become a suitable secondary option for an offense that never wants to see him on the field, save for instances such as the two kneel-downs that closed the Week 3 victory against the Jaguars. Garoppolo’s side gig is to prepare the starting defense for the quarterback they’re about to face in a game, so he’ll wear his Brandon Weeden hat this week.\n“It’s tough,” Garoppolo said of the challenge of balancing each responsibility. “The coaches do a good job. The defensive coaches help you, give you stuff for the scout team, what to do, what they want to see exactly. You have to do stuff on your own. Percentage-wise, most of it is on our offense, though.”\nSo for the bye week, Garoppolo welcomed the beneficial “me time” because it didn’t require any cram sessions to figuratively fit himself into another quarterback’s body. For a week, he could just be Jimmy Garoppolo, rather than Ben Roethlisberger , Tyrod Taylor or Blake Bortles .\n“It’s a chance to go back and reevaluate everything that’s gone on from all the way back in training camp, the preseason, all that,” Garoppolo said. “During the season, we’re kind of rolling and game-planning, so you don’t really get the opportunity. But during the bye week, I got to go back and check out some things that I don’t usually get to (in a game week).”\nGaroppolo’s role as the scout team quarterback is significant, but it never outweighs his own personal development as the backup. After all, he is a snap away from taking the reins of the 3-0 Patriots, while the scout team isn’t eligible for the playoffs.\n“Even when you’re not in there getting the live reps, you still have to take the mental part of it and go about it that way,” Garoppolo said. “It’s tougher to work that way, but you’ve got to deal with what you’re given, right?”\nGaroppolo’s week is a bit unique now, too, because he is mimicking a fellow backup in Weeden, who is playing for Tony Romo during his stint on short-term injured reserve. For that, Garoppolo essentially has combined Weeden’s antics and Romo’s Cowboys offense to give the Pats defense a look at everything.\nThat’s why it was important to take a breath during the bye.\n“(Weeden) has only played two games, so there’s not that much film on him,” Garoppolo said “So you’ve got to go back a little bit and go through some of the Romo tape. Each quarterback is a little different, so you’ve got to find little minute things that he does differently than the next guy to give the defense a better look that way.”\nHardy knock life\nWhen the dust settles from Greg Hardy ’s oddly directed trash talk toward Tom Brady and his wife, the Patriots still must find a way to block the Cowboys defensive end, who had 34 sacks in his previous five seasons with the Panthers.\nHardy, who will make his Cowboys debut Sunday after serving a four-game suspension, sacked Brady once in Week 11 of the 2013 season. He beat left tackle Nate Solder , who stared at a potential rusher inside and allowed Hardy free access to Brady’s blind side.\n“It’s been a while,” Solder said. “I’ve been doing some research just based on his preseason snaps, trying to refresh my memory on that stuff. He’s long, tall, an exceptional player, physical from what I remember. I remember it being a tough matchup.”\nSolder said his prep work this week will include old tape of Hardy while also studying the way the Cowboys like to rush their defensive ends.\n“I’ll do my best to review the last time he did play, but I’ve spent most of my time just watching the way Dallas does things because I’m sure he’ll adopt some of the ways they’re doing things,” Solder said. “It’s a combination of both things.”\nInjury notes\nLinebacker Dont’a Hightower (shoulder), defensive lineman Dominique Easley (hip) and cornerback Logan Ryan (shoulder) were removed from the injury report yesterday.\nCornerback Tarell Brown (foot) made his first appearance on the report this season. He was the only player who was active against the Jaguars but didn’t hit the field.\nDefensive end Trey Flowers ’ shoulder was added to the injury report. It’s unclear if it’s related to the shoulder injury he suffered in the preseason against the Packers, which kept him out for a week. Flowers had been listed as a full participant all season with a knee injury, but he was limited yesterday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:24:01.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
