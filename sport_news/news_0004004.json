The sixth-ranked Tigers dominated from start-to-finish and advanced to Saturday’s Evansville Semistate with a 5-0 victory. \nIt was Lawrenceburg’s third straight regional crown and fourth in five years. \n“We figured it would be a great game,” Lawrenceburg coach Bill Offutt said. “Providence is a great program and had a great season. I had not expectations of a 5-0 win. A complete surprise.” \nProvidence senior Taylor Hunton was impressed with the Tigers. \n“[I expect] a lot of those girls to go college and play,” she said. “They’re awesome.” \nSmith said it came down to Lawrenceburg finishing its opportunities and the Pioneers failing to do so. \n“They outplayed us tonight,” he said. “[Lawrenceburg] made plays. We came close to making plays, but their defense seemed to swarm out attackers at the last minute. That was their game and they were affective at it.” \nThe possession for the first 10 minutes was even and neither team had taken a shot. It was nearly halfway through the opening half when Macy Morgan’s free kick got by Providence keeper Katrina Cooper for a 1-0 Lawrenceburg lead. \n“Getting down early psychologically was a big deal,” Smith said. “I thought we could have come back.” \nProvidence controlled the ball for much of the final 20 minutes of the half. The Pioneers had possession deep in Lawrenceburg territory with just over five minutes to go in the half, but then the Tigers showed their quick-strike ability. \nLawrenceburg took a turnover from their own end and transitioned quickly to the other end. Then Peighton Cook found Josie Denton coming across the goal. Denton put the ball away for a 2-0 lead with 5:18 remaining in the half. \n“We played a solid game,” Offutt said. “We’ve been working on quick transition and it seemed to work tonight.” \n“That’s one of the most beautiful goals I’ve seen in a long time,” Smith said. “It was an incredible play. It was a great pass and a great finish.” \nLawrencburg outshot the Pioneers 8-1 in the opening half and things got worse early in the second half. Rachel Magee put the game away on another assist from Cook early in the half. Magee scored her second goal less than three minutes later and Denton added her second goal to cap the scoring. \nThe Pioneers (12-2-5) lose five seniors, including 2014 News and Tribune Player of the Year Emma Roesner and Hunton. \n“They had a great four years,” Smith said. “They won three sectionals and sustained the program. Factually speaking, we played 19 games and only had two losses. By most folk’s standards, that would be a great season.” \nLawrenceburg will now face Western Boone in the semistate semifinal Saturday in Evansville with an eye on the program’s first state title. \n“We’ve been down to the Final Four the last couple years,” Offutt said. “They know they’ve got something to prove. We’ll play them one game at a time and see what happens.” \n“It kinda sucks,” Hunton said. “Obviously I’m a senior and I can’t play anymore. As a season, we played pretty good and I’m proud of how we did. We came a long way from where we were.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:58:09.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
