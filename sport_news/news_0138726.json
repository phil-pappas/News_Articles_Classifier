Using a fifth incurs the penalty.\nVettel seemed fine with sacrificing his slim title hopes this season if its means better car performance over the final few races with an eye toward 2016. His Ferrari teammate, Kimi Raikkonen, also will get a new engine and a starting grid penalty.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
