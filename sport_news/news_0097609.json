Comment Posted Oct. 20, 2015 at 7:50 AM Updated at 7:54 AM Posted Oct. 20, 2015 at 7:50 AM Updated at 7:54 AM BOSTON – He was forced to take a break from the Celtics’ preseason last week due to a sore left knee. All rookie point guard Terry Rozier could do was sit in front of a television at home and watch as the team played a pair of games in New York. Injured during the Celtics’ trip to Europe, Rozier grudgingly hit the pause button in his first NBA training camp for a few days. The 16th pick in last summer’s draft, who is trying to make an early impression in order to earn a spot in the rotation, anxiously awaited his return to game action on Monday night. When the time came for Rozier to resume playing, he showed absolutely no signs of having been sidelined due to a knee ailment. Rozier, known for his quickness, was zipping all over the court during a 28-minute stint and helped produce a 111-105 victory over the Brooklyn Nets at the TD Garden. He had 16 points, hitting all three attempts from 3-point range, and added six assists, four rebounds and four steals as the Celtics improved to 4-1 in the preseason. “The knee didn’t bother me at all,’’ said Rozier. “They did a great job getting me prepared and sitting me out and taking care of my body and helping me stick to a routine before and after practice. I’m feeling good. “It feels real good playing with these guys and being a part of this organization. I finally got to play at home. It feels great.’’ With Isaiah Thomas sitting out to rest after getting kneed in the shin last week, Rozier played more minutes than he did in the first two games in Italy and Spain. While he wasn’t pleased with his defense in the first half, Rozier did get the Celtics running on offense. He is averaging 13 points, 3.7 assists and two steals in three games. “His quickness to the ball on defense,’’ said coach Brad Stevens when asked what he liked about Rozier’s performance. “I thought he got to loose balls multiple times, got balls off the floor. He pushed the pace offensively. The whole time he was in, the tempo was good. “I wanted to play him about 28 (minutes), so that’s good. I thought Terry could have gone another 20 minutes probably. He just kind of had that look about him.’’ With Marcus Smart and Thomas playing the point, Rozier will have to keep impressing in order to earn minutes once the regular season arrives next week. His ability to speed past defenders and make the right plays has opened eye already. Page 2 of 2 - “Terry is very high energy,’’ said Amir Johnson, who had 15 points on 6-for-8 shooting. “He pushes the ball up the floor. He’s athletic. I love his energy and his work ethic. If he keeps working hard, he’s going to make it in this league.’’ Getting in the offense in a hurry is something Rozier likes doing, using his speed as a weapon, just as he did at Louisville for Rick Pitino. “I like to push. That’s just me,’’ said Rozier. “The veterans were saying the first couple of practices, ‘Slow down, slow down.’ But that’s just me. I can’t help it. Whether the other team scores or misses, I want to push and try to get layups.’’ Rozier has also been effective from long range, going 6 for 8 on 3-pointers in his three games. Outside shooting figured to be something Rozier would have to improve while making the jump to the NBA, but so far, he has been productive in that area. “You get out what you put in,’’ said Rozier. “I put in a lot of work shooting threes. A lot of people said that’s what I was going to struggle with, it’s probably not my best thing. It’s something I’ve always worked on and it’s starting to carry over into the games. “I’m very confident. Me seeing it go in during practice allows me to be confident.’’ The Celtics have two more preseason games this week and four more practices before the season begins a week from Wednesday night against the Philadelphia 76ers. “Just keep working,’’ he said. “Practice, it tells everything. If you’re working hard in practice, it’ll carry over into the game. I know I’ve got a lot of good guys in my spot but it’s not going to ever stop me from working hard.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T15:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:44:41.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
