The Lancers had just converted two long fourth downs, and now one more play would give the Lancers an incredible comeback win. \nBut then Joe Samuelman stepped in front of the ball for the interception, and just like that, the game was over. \nWith five starters out, including key playmakers Jukka Morales and Ryan Good, the Knights needed Samuelman to do it all, and their senior captain came through. Samuelman finished with 118 yards and two touchdowns on 22 carries while grabbing two interceptions at linebacker, including the game-winner with seconds to play. \n“It was an All-Scholastic performance,” said North Andover coach John Dubzinski. “On offense he ran the ball great, on defense he was all over the field, he was just a menace to their offense.” \nAs a team, North Andover’s defense completely stuffed Lawrence’s run game, holding the Lancers to -33 yards overall, but the Lancers proved resilient in other areas, returning two kickoffs for touchdowns while recovering a pair of North Andover fumbles. \nThe first kickoff return came on the game’s opening play, when Darryl Munoz went 85 yards to the house to put Lawrence up 7-0. North Andover came back with a 2-yard touchdown from Samuelman later in the quarter, but the Lancers blocked the kick to maintain a 7-6 lead. \nNorth Andover quarterback Seamus Lambert rushed for a 29-yard touchdown midway though the second to briefly take a 12-7 lead, but after Lawrence stripped a North Andover player near their own end zone two possessions later, Lawrence quarterback found Angel Abreu for a 5-yard score to make it 14-12. \nThe Scarlet Knights grabbed the lead again in the third quarter after Samuelman rushed for another 2-yard score, which he followed with a 2-point conversion to make it 20-14. The Knights extended that lead early in the fourth when Lambert hit Thomas Regan for a 54-yard touchdown, scored in large part after Regan was able to juke a defender to open up space to run. \nAt that point, it was 28-14 and by all accounts North Andover’s game to lose, but then Lawrence responded with a 95-yard kickoff return for a touchdown courtesy of Abreu, and just like that, it was all wide open again. \nWith about two minutes to go, Lawrence stopped North Andover on third and short to force a punt with 2:04 to play, but a bad snap wound up dribbling out of the back of the end zone for a safety, meaning Lawrence would have a chance to drive for the win. \nLawrence returned the kickoff past midfield to start off with great field position, but then a sack and an intentional grounding penalty pushed the Lancers into a 3rd and 20 situation. Needing a conversion, Jenkins went to receiver Luis Crispin, who rewarded him with a 14 yard completion and then a 9-yarder on fourth down to keep the drive alive. \nThen, facing 4th and 10, Crispin saved his team again with a diving catch out of bounds to set up a 1st and goal, winner take all scenario. \n“If they scored the game would be over, because we had no time,” Dubzinski said. “They did great with clock management, they made great plays and we were very fortunate that Joe was in the right place at the right time.” \nThe late interception was the latest in a series of setbacks for the snake-bitten Lancers, who will now need a lot of help to qualify for the playoffs. Though the odds aren’t good, coach Mike Yameen said he’s hopeful his team will have an opportunity. \n“This team is pretty resilient, it’s been like that all year, things just haven’t fallen our way this year,” Yameen said. “Hopefully we’ll get a second chance, we have to hope a couple of teams knock each other off.” \nNorth Andover improves to 4-3, while Lawrence is now 3-4. \nNorth Andover 28, Lawrence 23 \nLawrence (3-4): 7 7 0 9 — 23 \nNorth Andover (4-3): 6 6 8 8 — 28 \nFirst Quarter \nL — Darryl Munoz 85 kickoff return (Eddie Cabrera kick), 10:42 \nN — Joe Samuelman 2 run (kick blocked), 2:11 \nSecond Quarter \nN — Seamus Lambert 29 run (run failed), 4:16 \nL — Angel Abreu 5 pass from Ismael Jenkins (Cabrera kick), 0:44 \nThird Quarter \nN — Samuelman 2 run (Samuelman run), 4:31 \nFourth Quarter \nN — Thomas Regan 54 pass from Lambert (Lambert run), 9:11 \nL — Abreu 95 kickoff return (Cabrera kick), 8:54 \nL — Safety, ball snapped out of end zone, 2:04 \nINDIVIDUAL LEADERS \nRUSHING: North Andover (38-230) — Joe Samuelman 22-118, Thomas Regan 5-64, Seamus Lambert 6-32, William Testa 5-16; Lawrence (16-(-33)) — Angel Abreu 6-0, Darryl Munoz 1-0, Chris Duran 1-0, Ismael Jenkins 8-(-33) \nPASSING: North Andover — Seamus Lambert 1-3, 54; Lawrence — Ismael Jenkins 12-24-3, 117 \nRECEIVING: North Andover — Thomas Regan 1-54; Lawrence — Eddie Cabrera 2-50, Luis Crispin 5-48, Angel Abreu 3-13, Mikey Caban 1-4 Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:09:47.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
