He's developed good relationships with the players and people respect him and what he brings to the table.\" \nGatland has led Wales to three Six Nations titles since taking charge in 2007, including two grand slams, while his injury-hit team managed a famous victory over England at Twickenham en route to the World Cup quarter-finals. \nThe futures of defence coach Shaun Edwards and attack coach Rob Howley are uncertain, but Roberts, 28, added: \"As for Shaun Edwards and Rob Howley, I know their contracts are coming to an end but, hopefully, the coaching team remains the same for Wales. \n\"I've been very lucky in my career to have a settled coaching set-up. Rob was just earning his coaching spurs at the Cardiff Blues when I came through and he and Shaun are all I've ever known in the international set-up. \n\"Shaun has brought the best out of me as a player and a person, and anyone can see how crucial he's been to us as a defensive unit, while Rob is someone I look up to massively and who has helped guide my career for over a decade.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T11:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:21:29.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
