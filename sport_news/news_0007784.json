Earnhardt led a race-high 61 laps, but had to settle for second in a race he had to win when the Harvick-triggered crash ended the race under caution. \n“When the race is over, I can live with the result as long as everyone else is going by the same rules,” Earnhardt said. “I felt like per the rule book, it sorted out and I finished second. I’m OK with that.” \nNASCAR said last week that it would make just one attempt at Talladega to finish the race under green instead of the usual three tries in a nod toward creating a safer racing environment. Drivers were almost unanimous in their support of the change. \nEliminated Sunday were Earnhardt, Ryan Newman — the runner-up to Harvick last year — and Joe Gibbs Racing drivers Matt Kenseth and Denny Hamlin . JGR was considered a heavy favorite in this Chase after a dominating regular season, but had two of four drivers eliminated Sunday and both were furious with Harvick. \nHarvick had radioed to his crew under caution that a mechanical issue was preventing him from accelerating. He hit Trevor Bayne as Bayne tried to dart around him and it triggered a wreck that brought out the caution to end the race. Earnhardt was unable to race Logano for the win once the caution was called. \n“It was a pretty tough ending. (He) knew he was blowing up and told everybody he was going to stay in his lane,” Kenseth said. “It just feels like we kind of lost control of the situation.” \n“What a joke we have a car with no motor wreck the field to end the race. Complete crap. Sorry to anyone who spent $ coming to this circus,” Hamlin tweeted. \nNASCAR reviewed video of the final restart and President Mike Helton said officials did not find anything amiss from Harvick. \nLogano, who won at Charlotte, Kansas and now Talladega in this round of the Chase, was showered in beer as he made his way to victory lane. It wasn’t a celebration from the pro-Earnhardt crowd, but Logano didn’t mind as he steered toward the cans being hurled in his direction. “I was aiming for them. ... It’s kind of a cool explosion when you hit beer cans,” he said. \nThe Chase \nAdvancing to the third round: Joey Logano, Carl Edwards , Brad Keselowski, Jeff Gordon , Kurt Busch , Martin Truex Jr., Kevin Harvick, Kyle Busch \nEliminated Sunday: Dale Earnhardt Jr., Ryan Newman, Matt Kenseth, Denny Hamlin. \nNext race: 500-mile race Sunday at Martinsville (Va.)
