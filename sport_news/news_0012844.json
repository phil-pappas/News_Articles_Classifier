The Falcons will now move on to face top-seeded Republic, who had a first round bye, in the district semifinals. Glendale quarterback Alex Houston, a sophomore, and receiver Luke Montgomery, a junior, both entered the state record books. Houston completed 33 of 41 passes for 470 yards. His nine touchdowns set a new single-game state record. And he surpassed the single-season touchdown state mark (58) with 65-and-counting. He also set state records in season-long completions, total offense and passing yardage. Montgomery went into the record books in single-season touchdown receptions (27) and total number of receptions. He also broke several Springfield public school records once held by Dorial Green-Beckham. And oh yeah. The 76 points Glendale scored is a new school record for points in a single game. Their basketball team might be jealous. It took the Falcons less than a minute and just three plays to travel 58 yards with Houston hitting Darius Brooks for a 6-0 lead (missed two-point conversion). Central moved 66 yards at 7:12 of the first quarter to forge a 6-6 tie on a two-yard run by D’Anthony Sappington but it took just four plays for Glendale to take the lead for good at 14-6 on Houston’s second TD pass to Zach Helm. After Central went three-and-out (a dangerous thing to do with Glendale’s explosive offense) the Falcons went ahead 20-6 on a three-yard TD toss to Montgomery at 4:02 of the first quarter. And after an interception at the Central 39-yard line by Glendale’s Carson Liston, another TD pass from Houston to Montgomery made it 28-6 at 1:16 of the first quarter. Houston’s fifth TD pass, a 51-yarder to Helm midway in the second quarter made it 34-12. And although Central fans had a brief hope of a possible momentum swing when Garrett King sprung loose 73 yards for a touchdown to pull the Bulldogs within 34-20, Glendale quickly responded with 14-unanswered points to end the half as Houston threw his sixth TD pass and scored on a 10-yard quarterback keeper 23-seconds before the intermission to put the Falcons on top 48-26. That’s right…48-26 and it was just half-over. Houston added three more touchdown passes in the third quarter before being lifted from the game and it was 70-26 as the two teams entered the fourth quarter. The Bulldogs added 22 points in the final frame against the Falcons non-starters and things got a little heated between the two-teams as words were exchanged in the final minutes. At one point Glendale head coach Mike Mauk, who’s son Maty (the suspended Mizzou quarterback0 was at the game, walked out to the middle of the field during a time-out to express his displeasure with the officials over their lack of control as things heated up but afterwards would only comment, “there wasn’t any exchange. Everybody was just trying to do their best to win.” Mauk would also not allow any reporters to interview Houston and Montgomery, the new state record holders, after the game. He sighted a rule he has that underclassmen are not allowed to be interviewed. “This game was about winning, not state records,” he commented. Mauk, who was back coaching for the second time since undergoing successful treatment for colorectal cancer, was willing to comment on how happy he was to see his team endure some tough times to win their playoff game. “Our guys have come a long way,” he said. “They’re nowhere near where they need to be but they’ve persevered though some situations like what I went through. We have some good kids from great families that work hard and I’ve been very proud that they’ve ended the season on some positive notes.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:31:18.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
