Image 17 of 17 Lightning, Owls strike in game against Florida Atlantic 1 / 17 Back to Gallery BOCA RATON, Fla. â€“ After a lengthy weather delay, and several lead changes, the Rice Owls defeated the Florida Atlantic Owls 27-26 in a Conference USA matchup Saturday afternoon on Schnellenberger Field at FAU Stadium in Boca Raton, Fla.\nDarik Dillard caught the game winning 14-yard touchdown pass from Driphus Jackson with just over 2:00 left in the game. His score made it 27-26 and the Owls then went for the two-point conversion which failed.\nAfter coming back from the lightning delay, Jackson scored on a 21-yard run with 7:21 remaining as he marched the Owls down the field in five plays. Jackson extended the drive with a long pass on third down to Connor Cella that put the ball deep in FAU's zone. This put Rice in position for Dillard's heroics.\nJunior kicker Greg Joseph gave FAU a third quarter lead with a 27-yard field goal at the 8:45 mark. The drive, a 15-play encounter, gave Florida Atlantic its first lead of the game.\nAfter Rice (2-4, 1-2) blocked an FAU punt, but could do nothing with it and Hayden Tobala was wide on a 32-yard field goal, Joseph then hit a 20-yard field goal on the ensuing drive to stretch FAU's lead to six at 20-14. The Owls had first and goal inside the five after a pass interference call, but the Rice defense held FAU to a field goal.\nJoseph made both of his attempts up to that point, while Tobala was errant on both of his.\nOn Rice's next drive, Jackson was sacked by Trey Hendrickson and he fumbled the ball over to FAU (2-3, 2-0) deep in Rice's own territory.\nAfter stopping FAU on third down, Rice extended the FAU drive with a face mask penalty that gave FAU a first and goal with 14:00 to play. One play later Trey Rodriguez scored a touchdown to put the score at 26-14. The two-point conversion failed.\nThe skies then also opened up and the rains came to visit with a smattering of lightning and the game was under a weather delay.\nRice opened the scoring on their first drive with a 32-yard scoring play as Jackson found Zach Wright on the right flank with a hitch pass and Wright took it to the house. It was an impressive drive for Rice as they marched 75 yards in nine plays, consuming 4:09 off the clock. With the PAT from Tobala, Rice took an early 7-0 lead.\nThe early lead was short lived, however, as FAU would go on to score on their first drive as Jaquez Johnson hit Kalib Woods with an 11-yard square in pass in the middle of the end zone. The 12-play drive took 4:50 and went for 75 yards.\nRice would answer on their next drive as Jackson found Cella for the score. Jackson scrambled at the five-yard line and threw the ball into the middle of the end zone where Cella got behind the secondary and made the catch for the touchdown. With 1:30 to play in the opening quarter, Rice led 14-7. The 75-yard drive took 11 plays for Rice.\nWith 5:56 to play in the half, Florida Atlantic tied the game up in two plays, good for 97 yards as Johnson found Kamrin Solomon streaking down the middle of the field and hit him in stride for a 94-yard scoring play. The play was the longest of both players' careers. With the PAT, the score was tied at 14-14.\nSolomon was one-on-one with a cornerback and got two steps behind him. The pass was a little behind him so he tipped the ball to himself, made the catch, and out ran the defense for the score. The scoring play was the longest in FAU history.\nTobala had a chance to give Rice a lead before the half, but he misfired on a 34-yard field goal with 1:30 to play. Instead, the teams went into the locker room at half time tied at 14.\nRice was eight for ten on third down conversions in the first half. They ran a very efficient offense as they amassed 252 yards in the half.\nScott Salomon is a freelance writer.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/33/8771278/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/13/8770288/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/33/8771277/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/33/8771279/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/13/8770287/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/33/8771275/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/13/8770281/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/13/8770282/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/13/8770284/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/13/8770286/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/33/8771278/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/33/8771277/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/33/8771276/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/13/8770289/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/13/8770283/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/13/8770280/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/33/8771280/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/13/8770286/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/13/8770285/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/13/8770285/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/33/8771276/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/13/8770282/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/13/8770288/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/13/8770284/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/33/8771279/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/13/8770287/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/33/8771275/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/33/8771280/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/13/8770283/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/13/8770289/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/13/8770280/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/13/8770281/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T02:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:33:31.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
