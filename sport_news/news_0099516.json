For the first timers, this year you’re getting a succinct review. Essentially, we’ll talk fantasy relevant touch, target, and snap count data to help identify any trends that can improve your roster. I’ll try to avoid discussing anything overly obvious and stick to that which could provide you with actionable information to help improve your rosters. \nAnything I missed? It’s all being charted, even if it doesn’t make the article. Feel free to get at me on twitter ( @joncollinsFSLR ) or ask in the comments section. \nOne final note: this column uses Pro Football Focus’ ‘thrown at’ data which occasionally differs from a standard ‘target’ count in that it’s charting throws that were truly intended for a receiver, rather than throwaways which may have been aimed in his direction. \n… Onwards. [ Jump to the AFC ] Touches and Targets Week 6: Arizona Cardinals \nMichael Floyd remained third in the pecking order, and is indeed third in relevance after another consistent outing (10/8/93) from Larry Fitzgerald and a huge outing from John Brown (14/10/196/TD) but, his own 8/5/50 day featured a score, and, came with three additional targets from the red zone, thrown into the end zone that could have led to an even bigger day from Floyd. They don’t necessarily suggest that he’s the team’s primary red zone option moving forward but the trend is certainly worth monitoring. On the note of trends, John Brown’s 14 targets came at an average of 20.7 yards deep. It’s one thing to post an aDot over 20 on three targets, its quite another as a regular part of the passing game. \nHe won’t always have a matchup that lends itself to such a high target number, but, there are more 200 yard games in his future if Palmer keeps looking for him deep. \nWith two games played since Andre Ellington ‘s return to the lineup, we appear to have our confirmation that Chris Johnson will serve as the team’s lead back. Even with Arizona finding themselves in a late hole, Johnson out-carried Ellington 14-1, with three carries given to David Johnson . Meanwhile, Ellington made two catches for 47 yards with each of the Johnson’s securing their lone target. As noted by his 23.5 YPR, Ellington is a big play waiting to happen, but, CJ is the only Cards back I’m starting with any confidence – Ellington has just six touches in those two games. Touches and Targets Week 6: Atlanta Falcons \nTevin Coleman actually looked quite effective in the Thursday Nighter, before coughing up a fumble and yielding to the team’s true three down back. All told, he had four carries (putting the ball on the ground twice) for 40 yards. Freeman, meanwhile, continued his torrid pace. He produced 100 yards and a score on 13 carries, but, his role in the passing game was more exciting for those hoping he can keep his RB#1 value up over the long term. Freeman was targeted ten times with the Falcons working to come back against the Saints, and secured eight of those for an additional 56 yards and a score. At this point, just another day at the office. \nJulio Jones : 10 targets; Leonard Hankerson : 6; Roddy White : 4. And such is the established order in Atlanta. White was able to secure a short TD and provide some fantasy value as a result, but, as long as all parties are healthy he’s being used behind Hankerson and likely will be the rest of the way. Touches and Targets Week 6: Carolina Panthers \nIt was Greg Olsen ‘s big day (11/7/131/TD) that propelled Carolina’s comeback, but, that level of work is expected on a regular basis and certainly against Seattle. The surprise came at receiver, where Devin Funchess led the group in targets for the first time in his young career. \nNo doubt, some of that was dictated by the matchup with Ted Ginn and Philly Brown drawing top coverage, and, Funchess was charged with as many drops as he made receptions (two), but, it’s a trend worth monitoring as we edge toward the second half of his first season. If the trend holds, it speaks to Funchess showing a better grasp of things in practice which could soon translate to the field. Those drops, however, are something that he’ll have to fix to make good on any increase in volume. Touches and Targets Week 6: Chicago Bears Alshon Jeffery was targeted all over the field – and in the end zone – against Detroit (Photo: Source: Christian Petersen/Getty Images North America). \nThe Bears played their first game with their full compliment of pass catchers since Week 1, and, the roles were as expected. Alshon Jeffery didn’t play a full game, mind you, but he led receivers with 11 targets and was used in all situations – curl routes to move the chains, deep balls in contested coverage, and the standard sideline and end zone routes. TE Martellus Bennett matched him with 11 looks, while Marquess Wilson drew the deep stuff (four targets, at an average depth of 19.3) while Eddie Royal was targeted seven times close to the line and produced five grabs. \nAll of that sounds pretty standard. Chicago won’t necessarily throw as often in every week, but, lots of work for Jeffery and Bennett will hold, with the others filling their noted roles. Royal the safe PPR play, Wilson the boom/bust third receiver. Touches and Targets Week 6: Detroit Lions \nA funny thing happened for Detroit this week. Calvin Johnson was targeted deep (21.1 aDot) and he produced, using his size and athleticism to make plays over top of coverage. All told, he put up 166 yards on six receptions, as part of a team-leading nine targets. It’s worth noting that OC Joe Lombardi called plays from the booth as opposed to the sideline for the first time all season in this game. \nGolden Tate scored as well, with eight targets of his own and a controversial TD on his six receptions. Lance Moore drew a healthy six looks, finding the end zone and crossing the century mark as well. Moving forward, you should expect a more aggressive offense from Detroit. They did start looking to Johnson deep last week, but, saw mixed results against Seattle. Deeper targets should be great news for Johnson’s fantasy value. \nWith Joique Bell out another week, Ameer Abdullah remained in control of the backfield with 14 carries for 52 yards, and three receptions. Theo Riddick was given a surprising seven carries, though much of that likely had to do with Zach Zenner ‘s significant injury. Still, he was targeted five times, catching three balls. Those three catches are his fewest since Week 1 and he’s a solid weekly PPR play as a result. You’ll want to monitor his role when Bell returns, as theoretically Abdullah could revert to a passing down back role, but, Riddick has been too productive to keep off the field. Touches and Targets Week 6: Green Bay Packers \nJames Starks , not Eddie Lacy , drew the start this week and was the driver for the Green Bay offense. The Packers held the ball for just 22 minutes in this game, so, the rushing numbers look even worse for Lacy than they would have with a more even time of possession, but, a four carry two yard performance certainly isn’t what you wagered for with your first round pick. \nMike McCarthy defended his use after the game noting that the lead back was still dealing with an injury, and, that Starks had been hot. It’s hard to argue with that statement after a two score, 117 total yard effort on just 12 touches. Starks won’t keep Lacy down all season, but, he’s certainly enough to earn consistent work. Meantime, despite some advice I gave out to the contrary this week, owners with intriguing options on their bench may be wise to leave Lacy reserved until his work (and production) picks up a bit. \nThe passing game numbers (five targets for Randall Cobb , four for James Jones ) were similarly skewed by the low TOP on the wrong side of Philip Rivers ‘ 500 yard day. style=\"display:inline-block;width:728px;height:90px\" data-ad-slot=\"1507870491\"> Touches and Targets Week 6: Minnesota Vikings \nStefon Diggs excelled for the second straight game with Charles Johnson unable to go despite the bye week. Against a beatable Chiefs secondary, Mike Wallace struggled (seven targets, two receptions) while Diggs gobbled up seven of his eight targets from Teddy Bridgewater . They were thrown at an average depth of 12.1 yards, so, it wasn’t as if he was just collecting yards on slants, either. \nThe true test for Diggs’ long term viability comes when Johnson is activated, but, he’s a warranted add in 12 team leagues and could end up playing a significant role for the Vikes. Right now, it seems like HC Mike Zimmer is willing to give him a long look . Touches and Targets Week 6: New Orleans Saints \nWhile Atlanta’s apparent unwillingness to cover the position had something to do with it, its worth noting that Ben Watson ‘s big night game with Marques Colston out of the lineup. All told, Watson was targeted 12 times (catching 10 for 127 yards and a score) while Josh Hill was targeted a season high five times. That number was more than any other receiver, with Willie Snead and Brandin Cooks drawing five targets each and Brandon Coleman seeing just one. \nAgain, its hard to know how that will look next time out against a new opponent, but, it seems safe to reason that the TEs will factor in again. Then, there’s also this to think about: Brees looked the best he’s looked all season and Brandin Cooks went 4-41. Stop chasing ghosts here. \n— Rich Hribar (@LordReebs) October 16, 2015 \nIn the run game, Mark Ingram wasn’t particularly efficient (20 carries, 46 yards) but he did score twice and saw much more work than Khiry Robinson (seven carries) and C.J. Spiller (three). Spiller led backs with five targets and four catches, while Ingram maintained three targets and caught them all. Spiller is the big play ticket in the passing game, but, PPR owners can feel safe assuming that Ingram will still get those handful of looks a game even with him in the lineup. Touches and Targets Week 6: New York Giants \nShane Vereen completely disappeared from the game script this week against Philadelphia, even with the Eagles maintaining a sizable lead in the second half. He had four carries for zero yards, adding a catch on three targets. Andre Williams (five carries, six yards) wasn’t any more productive. That was good news for Rashad Jennings , who remains the safest play here, as he picked up 13 carries for 63 yards and added three receptions. That gives him 66 carries and 14 catches through six games – hardly enough volume to be a weekly lock, but far and away the most use on the team. Touches and Targets Week 6: Philadelphia Eagles \nDeMarco Murray now boasts back-to-back 20 carry, 100 total yard outings after his dismal start to the season. This week against the Giants, he picked up 112 yards on 21 carries and added three receptions (three targets) while scoring. It was his best statistical outing of the year, and, he looked good overall running the ball against the Gmen. Ryan Mathews chipped in with nine carries and a catch, while Darren Sproles had three touches, so it wasn’t Murray’s backfield unto himself, but it sure looks like he’s in control and should be counted upon for 20 touch outings in the short term at least. \nIn the pass game, with Nelson Agholor inactive, Jordan Matthews did his usual thing (10/6/59) but Zach Ertz was one of the bigger beneficiaries. Ertz followed Matthews as the second most targeted Eagle, drawing seven, and he caught four balls. \nMeanwhile, Riley Cooper continued to be engaged. He drew a number of deep looks from a struggling Sam Bradford , including his 30+ yard TD and finished with five targets, three receptions, and the score. Josh Huff and Miles Austin each saw three targets. That brings Cooper’s two week target total to 13, and while you can argue that he doesn’t deserve them, the production suggests he’ll continue to serve as the second most targeted WR. He may not be worth an add, but, is a warranted DFS consideration in the right matchup. Touches and Targets Week 6: Seattle Seahawks \nBriefly, Thomas Rawls had just one carry with a healthy Marshawn Lynch (16, and a reception) in the lineup. That much is to be expected. Rawls is still a great hold in case Lynch misses more time, but, when he’s good to go the backfield works belong to him exclusively. \nJimmy Graham had 10 targets and made eight catches for 140 yards in another week where his usage had been much discussed coming into the game. And, the offense looked good with Graham engaged. His opportunities are likely to ebb and flow as they have all season, but, with a concerted effort to get him the ball the team moved the chains against a tough Panthers D. As such, you shouldn’t expect too many games where he is overlooked as he has been in the early part of the season. Touches and Targets Week 6: San Francisco 49ers \nCarlos Hyde carried the ball 21 times for San Francisco this week, but, wound up injured and is questionable for Thursday Night’s short turn around. The expectation is that he’ll be good to go, but, it should be noted that Mike Davis was his chief backup in this game (as he has been all season). Davis had just one carry for no yards, but, could be thrust into a larger role on Thursday – contingent upon the status of Hyde and Reggie Bush . \nTorrey Smith ‘s deep touchdown yielded an excellent stat line, but, I’m still not trusting him on four targets (just one more than Quinton Patton , who also scored this week). Anquan Boldin was Colin Kaepernick ‘s first read more often than not again this week, and, that should remain the case. With the 49ers passing game no longer looking like a total abomination, that’s great news for Boldin (8/5/102, following an 11 target outing in Week 5) but I really don’t trust anyone else. Smith is a solid GPP flier or best ball contributor against a poor secondary, but, four looks will leave you hungry for points more often than not. Touches and Targets Week 6: Washington \nAlfred Morris didn’t help his cause all that much with Matt Jones out of the lineup this week. He led ball carriers with 11, but, managed to gain just 22 yards. Chis Thompson had five behind him – one from the goal line – and contributed his standard PPR friendly line. He was targeted eight times, making six receptions… he didn’t get far on them (26 yards), but again, in the PPR world that’s mostly moot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:24:24.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
