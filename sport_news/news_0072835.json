Lynch and Mebane had both been listed as questionable after Saturday's final practice. \nLynch injured his hamstring late in the first half of Seattle's 26-0 win over Chicago last Sunday. Lynch was hurt catching a fourth-down pass just before halftime. \nSeattle coach Pete Carroll said Lynch had an MRI on the injury earlier this week and the scan showed some \"findings\" but did not elaborate. It will be just the second game Lynch has missed since joining the Seahawks in 2010 and the first since the 2011 season. \nRookie Thomas Rawls, who rushed for 104 yards last week in Lynch's absence, will likely get the start against the Lions. \nMebane suffered a groin injury against the Bears and did not practice all week. \nSeattle also added linebacker Bruce Irvin to the injury report with an ankle injury. He is questionable. \n___ \nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our KIRO-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:37:10.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
