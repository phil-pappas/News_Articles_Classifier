He's being held on $2.5 million bail at Multnomah County's Inverness Jail.\nThe accusations surfaced Sept. 10 when the mother of one of the boys alerted Gresham police that her son had told her of inappropriate sexual touching, according to a probable cause affidavit filed in court.\nTwo of the alleged victims were members of a youth wrestling club that DeRemer started called Eastside Elite Mat Club.\nOne of the boys told police that DeRemer had reached across and touched his upper thigh while driving him home from practice. The boy, under age 14, said the touching made him uncomfortable but he didn't know how to respond and was scared to tell anyone, Multnomah County Deputy District Attorney David Hannon wrote in the affidavit.\nThe next time the boy got a ride home from DeRemer, he sat in the back seat but his friend sat in front. The friend also told police that DeRemer placed his hand on his upper thigh near his genitals and rubbed his hand around during the ride home, the affidavit said.\nThe friend also said DeRemer wanted to take wrestling photographs of him at his home. They ended up watching a movie together in DeRemer's basement and DeRemer pulled him onto his lap and rubbed his upper thigh area, according to the affidavit.\nThe friend told police he didn't know what to do because DeRemer was his coach, someone he had looked up to, the affidavit said.\nDuring a recorded phone call by one of the boys to DeRemer, DeRemer said he wasn't sure what to say about the accusations but added that he was a young coach at the time and anything he may have done wasn't intended to make the boy feel uncomfortable, the affidavit said.\nGresham police Detective Aaron Turnage interviewed DeRemer on Sept. 23. DeRemer initially denied the allegations, the affidavit said, but then admitted they had occurred. DeRemer also told the detective that he had been sexually aroused by the encounters and fantasized about them later, the affidavit said.\nDeRemer also disclosed additional victims, including another Gresham boy and two boys in Finland when he was visiting friends there, the affidavit said. The indictment doesn't include all of the boys he mentioned.\nThe alleged offenses occurred between August 2007 and January 2012, according to the indictment. The four victims identified in the indictment are all from Gresham.\nOver the years, DeRemer has worked with children as an assistant coach or volunteer at Gresham High School , Dexter McCarty Middle School, Clear Creek Middle School, Boy Scouts of America, Eagles Club, Eastside Elite Mat Club, USA Wrestling Association, Gresham Mat Club, Estacada Mat Club and Cobra Wrestling Mat Club.\nA Gresham High grad, DeRemer worked as a paid assistant coach, last working there in spring 2015. Most recently, he worked as an in-home health-care provider for the state Department of Human Services, working with developmentally disabled children and as a children's life-skills coach for Trillium Family Services in Portland.\nThe Gresham-Barlow School District is cooperating with police investigating the case. Police urged anyone with information about DeRemer's activities to call Detective Aaron Turnage at 503-823-0189.\nOregonian staff writer Rick Bella contributed to this story.\n-- Maxine Bernstein\nmbernstein@oregonian.com\n503-221-8212\n@maxoregonian", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/maxoregonian", "http://www.trilliumfamily.org/"], "published": "2015-10-12T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:18:08.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
