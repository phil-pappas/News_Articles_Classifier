The annual \"blackout\" game for a prime-time kickoff should have the crowd revved up. The Knights are coming off a bye, so they should be refreshed and prepared for the matchup. And, most importantly, star wide receiver Leonte Carroo is back after a two-game suspension .\nThose factors should have the Scarlet Knights fired up for the start of the game. The key will be sustaining that energy over 60 minutes against a superior opponent.\nHere are five things Rutgers needs to do win the game:\n1. Rutgers' offensive line must perform well\nCarroo and a stable of dynamic running backs will be rendered useless if the offensive gets overpowered like it did in a 28-3 loss to Penn State earlier this season .\nMichigan State has a strong defensive line, led by Shilique Calhoun. The defensive end from Middletown, N.J., has 4.5 of the Spartans' 18.5 sacks this season, which is tied for sixth nationally.\nIt should be a great matchup when Calhoun squares off against Rutgers left tackle Keith Lumpkin . But the Spartans play Calhoun on both sides and he should be able to exploit right tackle J.J. Denman, who has struggled in pass protection. Rutgers would be wise to keep a tight end in to block or to have a running back ready to help against Calhoun.\nThe Knights have only allowed six sacks this season, but five came against Penn State, which has a comparable pass rush to Michigan State's. Quarterback Chris Laviano has used his mobility to avoid some sacks, but he needs to step up into the pocket at times so he can deliver the ball downfield rather than always bailing out at the first sign of pressure.\nThe run game has been productive in three of Rutgers' games, but again, Penn State's front dominated. The Knights' top three backs averaged 3.5 yards per carry against Penn State; they've averaged 5.9 yards per carry in the other three games.\nMichigan State gave up 165 yards in a 24-21 win over Purdue last week. The Scarlet Knights won't have a chance if Michigan State controls the line of scrimmage.\nRELATED: Staff predictions for the Rutgers-Michigan State game\n2. Rutgers must make big plays\nIt's time for offensive coordinator Ben McDaniels to get creative. Michigan State has four games of McDaniels' play-calling to scout, so the Spartans should be well-prepared for counter runs and Laviano rollouts.\nMcDaniels was ultra-conservative in the Penn State loss, stubbornly running the ball between the tackles despite the offensive line's inability to open holes. Rutgers will need to try to establish its ground game, but McDaniels can't be afraid to open up the playbook. The Knights are coming off a bye, so they've had an extra week to add a wrinkle or trick play for Michigan State. And, as usual, any way to get the ball to explosive receiver Janarion Grant is encouraged.\nNFL departures and injuries have opened up the airways in Michigan State's \"No Fly Zone.\" The Spartans rank 91st nationally in passing yards allowed and they just lost their best defensive back, safety R.J. Williamson, to injury.\nMichigan State has given up 22 pass plays of 20-plus yards this season, which ranks 121st nationally. If Laviano finally takes some shots downfield, there should be opportunities for Carroo, who is averaging 25.9 yards per catch this season.\n3. Rutgers must stop the run\nRutgers coaches and players always talk about stopping the run as the top priority of the defense. The Scarlet Knights are built to play smash mouth football and they'll get the opportunity to line up against a Michigan State offense determined to impose its will.\nOverall, the Scarlet Knights have been strong against the run this season, ranking 27th nationally in rushing defense. But again, the Penn State game raised some major red flags. The Nittany Lions shredded Rutgers for 330 yards rushing in that matchup.\nThe Spartans have two talented backs in L.J. Scott (6.2 yards per carry) and Madre London (4.7 ypc). The Spartans' offensive line is banged up, but they still managed 267 yards rushing last week against Purdue.\nQuarterback Connor Cook poses a major challenge to an inexperienced secondary, but if the Knights can't stop the run, they'll have no chance. They need to force Cook into third-and-longs to put their young defensive backs in better situations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:53:04.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
