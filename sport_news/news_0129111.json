Picture: Phil Hillyard\nRebecca Williams Herald Sun SWIM star James Magnussen says he is ahead of schedule in his recovery from shoulder surgery as he steps up his bid for Olympic redemption in Rio next year.\nThe dual world 100m freestyle champion expects to be back at full training intensity in the next fortnight after his shoulder operation in June.\nMagnussen was forced to make the difficult decision earlier this year to pull out of the August world championships in Kazan, Russia, to repair his injured left shoulder.\nHe had been aiming to become the first man to win three straight world 100m freestyle titles.\nMagnussen said he had experienced a trouble-free rehabilitation so far and his shoulder was almost back to full strength.\n“I’m in the final stages of the rehab process and back into some swimming and lifting weights and feeling good, so it’s all going smoothly,’’ Magnussen said.\n“I think along the way, I have been sort of ahead of the benchmarks of where you need to be the whole time so everyone from coaches to physios, surgeons are really happy with how it’s gone.\n“I’m more or less back into full training now, definitely full distance, just not full intensity.\n“So probably over the next couple of weeks I’ll be back to training as per usual.’’\nWhile he missed the opportunity to stamp his name in swimming history in Kazan, Magnussen said missing the world titles had helped take the pressure off his Olympic preparation.\n“I’d like to be under the radar as much as possible, it would be very different from my last Olympic preparation,’’ Magnussen said.\n“It’s a completely different preparation for me to what I did four years ago, but I’m feeling confident, I’m feeling increasingly confident in my body.\n“I think last summer it was about getting my head in the right space and this time I think my head is where it needs to be and now I just need to get my body right and I think hopefully I can go one better than last time.’’\nOlympic gold eluded Magnussen in the 100m freestyle by an agonising 0.01 sec at the London Games as he claimed silver behind American Nathan Adrian.\nMagnussen said he had been buoyed by the winning time of China’s Ning Zetao in the 100m freestyle in Russia, which was slower than the Australian’s title victories in 2011 and 2013.\n“It wasn’t super fast so I wasn’t worried,’’ Magnussen said.\n“It made me feel really good about it all. It was good to watch that and get some confidence at a point when I couldn’t swim so that definitely kept me motivated for my rehab.’’\nMagnussen said he would look to make a return to competition early in the New Year, with the Victorian state championships from January 22-24 a possibility, before the Olympic selection trials in Adelaide in April.\n Faulty Missile aiming for Rio target", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/5f6165ce4ae2e12513d91c5ba32e0b01", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/more-sports/james-magnussen-in-last-stages-of-rehab-as-he-begins-preparations-for-rio-olympics-after-shoulder-surgery/story-fnibbyyv-1227573610500"], "published": "2015-10-19T08:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:29:39.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
