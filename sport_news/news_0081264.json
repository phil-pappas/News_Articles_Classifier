He was found guilty of culpable homicide – a charge equivalent to manslaughter – after saying he shot Steenkamp through a locked bathroom door because he mistook her for an intruder.\nRelated: Oscar Pistorius trial: the full story, day by day\nEven if he is released, Pistorius faces a further test on 3 November when prosecutors appeal to South Africa’s supreme court to try to secure a murder conviction and a harsher sentence.\nSteenkamp’s parents have strongly opposed the athlete’s possible parole.\nAgence France-Presse contributed to this report.", "external_links": ["http://ewn.co.za/2015/10/09/Parole-board-may-consider-Pistorius-case-today"], "published": "2015-10-09T15:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:00:07.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
