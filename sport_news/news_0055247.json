The Dolphins have a bye this week. \nBut a disappointed Ross believed the team was not progressing fast enough, and that the season still could be salvaged. \n\"This was a tough decision for me to make knowing how tirelessly Joe worked in his four years here to make this a winning team. He is a man of the highest character and integrity that I developed a close personal relationship with,\" Ross said. \nDolphins tight ends coach Dan Campbell has been named interim coach and he will remain in that position throughout the season. \nPhilbin compiled a 24-28 in Miami since taking over in 2012. He is the first head coach in the NFL to lose his job this season.
