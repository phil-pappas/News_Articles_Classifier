The communication level is there.\n“I would never have thought I would get a chance to work with him, and now I am. It’s one of those things I will be able to tell my grandkids.”\nWhile Glenn has been cramming in advance of Montreal’s game against the visiting Hamilton Tiger-Cats on Sunday at Percival Molson Stadium, Jeff Mathews has been settling into a groove as the Ticats’ starting quarterback. Glenn will start for his sixth CFL team (he has been on the roster of eight different clubs, a CFL record, though his brief stops in Toronto and Ottawa came and went without him playing for either team) and will attempt to get the Alouettes into the playoffs via a crossover spot. Mathews, in his third CFL start, knows that a Hamilton victory on Sunday would clinch a berth for his team and keep it on point for an East Division title.\nMathews will have a new target as Andy Fantuz returns from an elbow injury, and will try to take a little something off his passes when the situation calls for it.\n“We have talked about that a little bit,” Mathews said with a smile. “There is a time and place for everything. Sometimes you need to fire balls in there and sometimes you don’t.\n“People say I throw hard and I tell the guys to catch it. We’re on the same page. As long as we get completions, we’re good to go.”\nAs for the injured Zach Collaros, there is speculation that he will have surgery on the torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee as soon as this week, but Ticats head coach Kent Austin would not confirm that.\n“I hope so,” Austin said. “It needs to be close.”\nCollaros suffered the injury on Sept. 19 during a game against the Edmonton Eskimos.\nThe Ticats’ bumps at quarterback pale in comparison to the revolving door the Alouettes have experienced in 2015. Glenn is the eighth quarterback on the Montreal roster this season, and will be the fourth to start. That’s one fewer than the CFL record of five starting quarterbacks on one team in a single year, a dubious distinction set by Ottawa in 1995 and equalled by Hamilton in 1996 and Calgary in 2003.\nThe inexperience for the Als at the position gave general manager and interim head coach Jim Popp no choice but to pull the trigger on a trade for Glenn. But when he looks in the mirror, Glenn doesn’t see a saviour for what is shaping up to be a lost season for Montreal.\n“It’s not going to be ‘Kevin Glenn takes the team to the playoffs,’” Glenn said. “It’s going to be ‘the Montreal Alouettes get into the playoffs.’ It’s going to take all of us, not just me.”\nHaving Calvillo on the sideline should help.\n“The biggest (change) is terminology and how they read certain things,” Glenn said. “Everywhere you go, you run off the same concepts, you can only run so many routes.\n“With (himself and Calvillo) being in the league for so long, we can talk about a play and visualize it to where we don’t have to have the bottle cap and the Monopoly pieces.”\nFIVE THINGS TO WATCH\nANDY CAN BE DANDY: The Tiger-Cats will welcome back slotback Andy Fantuz after the 31-year-old veteran missed the previous nine games with an elbow injury. As Kent Austin has said, Fantuz’s participation is like having another quarterback in the offence, given his knowledge of the game. It’s a bonus for Hamilton, no doubt.\nHEAT IS ON GLENN: The Alouettes expect Kevin Glenn to start producing immediately. The Ticats could be helped by the fact they saw Glenn just last week when he was with Saskatchewan, and was unable to score in the first half before he was pulled. Can Glenn excel against a Hamilton defence that is stingy against the pass?\nTURN OVER THE TURNOVERS: Montreal twice has beat Hamilton this season and did so by playing clean football. In the two games combined, Hamilton committed eight turnovers, Montreal three. “That was the biggest key for us (in those games),” Alouettes general manager and interim head coach Jim Popp said on Saturday.\nHOWARD’S END: Cord Howard, signed to the practice roster in September, will make his first start at left tackle for the Ticats. He can’t afford to be a step behind in familiarity with the offensive line. “There is a big challenge in front of him,” Hamilton coach Kent Austin said. “We just felt he was the most trustworthy.”\nA SKID TO BE ERASED?: The Tiger-Cats have not won a regular-season game in Montreal since Oct. 20, 2002, a span of 18 games. It’s their longest road losing streak in club history, and just two shy of the CFL record of 20, shared by Saskatchewan (at Calgary, 1990-2002) and Ottawa (at Edmonton, 1984-2015).\nTERRY'S TAKE\nAs much as veteran Kevin Glenn should help the Alouettes in the final three weeks of the regular season, it’s asking a lot for him to be fully ready after arriving in Montreal mid-week. Jeff Mathews has shaken off a tough first appearance, though he will have his hands full with the Als defence.\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nNew Alouettes' QB Glenn hopes to deliver\nBy Terry Koshan , Toronto Sun First posted: Saturday, October 17, 2015 07:48 PM EDT | Updated: Saturday, October 17, 2015 07:52 PM EDT\nMONTREAL — Kevin Glenn didn’t envision a day that would find him hunkering down and analyzing football strategy with Anthony Calvillo.\nAfter all, when Calvillo was putting up numbers for the Montreal Alouettes that led to his solid footing among the greatest quarterbacks in Canadian Football League history, Glenn often was on the other side, trying to devise a way to beat his prolific opponent.\nWith a trade to the Alouettes from the Saskatchewan Roughriders last week, Glenn has spent lots of study time in the past several days with Calvillo, now the Alouettes’ quarterbacks coach.\n“It has been pretty good because we both lived this life,” Glenn said in the Alouettes’ locker room at Olympic Stadium on Saturday. “I have so much respect for that guy.
