(Photo: Daniel Mears, Detroit News) \nCONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Detroit — With the Lions trailing the Arizona Cardinals 28-7 with 6:27 left in the third quarter, the coaches told Matthew Stafford he would not have an opportunity to mount a comeback.\nDan Orlovsky replaced Stafford in the second half of a game well on its way to being a blowout, and the crowd at Ford Field welcomed Orlovsky with a loud ovation.\nStafford’s benching followed a drive in which he threw his third interception of the game, a pass thrown right to Cardinals cornerback Patrick Peterson on fourth-and-3 at the Arizona 45. Arizona turned the interception into another touchdown, taking a 35-7 lead before Orlovsky replaced Stafford.\nThrough two-plus quarters, Stafford was 20 of 32 for 188 yards and one touchdown. The Lions lost five turnovers before he exited, including fumbles by running back Ameer Abdullah and wide receiver Golden Tate.\nWith a 23-yard completion to Calvin Johnson, Orlovsky became the first Lions quarterback to throw a pass in a game since Shaun Hill replaced an injured Stafford in Week 3 of 2012.\nStafford has started 69 consecutive regular-season games for the Lions.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:47:59.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
