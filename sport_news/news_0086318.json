Silva scored his third goal of the season in the 11th minute with a header from close range from Guido Carrillo's cross. \nCarillo hit the woodwork twice in the first half and Reims keeper Johny Placide made a good save to deny Nabil Dirar's 20-meter effort in the 66th minute. \nReims was reduced to ten men two minutes later after Antoine Devaux was sent off for a second yellow card. \nThe hosts played better following Devaux's dismissal and their best chance came in added time when Jordan Siebatcheu fired a low shot onto Danijel Subasic's post. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:39:42.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
