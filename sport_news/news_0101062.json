Driving them downfield for a go-ahead field goal or touchdown against the Denver Broncos. Driving the Raiders across midfield, then across the Denver 40 yard line, then the 35 yard line ... \nAnd then he wasn't. \nFeeling blitz pressure, Carr unloaded a pass across the middle to open space. That space was quickly was filled by the hands of Denver defender Chris Harris. In full stride, Harris took the ball 74-yards the other way for a pick-six score that gave Denver a 16-7 lead with 6:53 remaining in the game. Essentially, game over. \n\"It's really hard,\" Carr said. \"As we're learning, this league is so close, you're so close in all these games that you can't let missed opportunities happen.\" \nHe hadn't learned that before Sunday? \nThe difficult task for a Raiders watcher these days is trying to put Carr's performances in perspective. Is he making progress? Is he standing still? Is he regressing? \nNo one was expecting the team to win the Super Bowl this season. No one was expecting the Raiders to lose every game, either. So the eyes naturally get cast on the man who is scheduled to be the franchise's standard-bearer for the next decade. Advertisement \nSunday, those eyes were cast on that very, very bad interception. But upon further review and locker room debriefing, the blame should not fall entirely on Carr. When the Broncos blitzed, Carr did what he was supposed to do. He found the \"hot\" receiver and got rid of the ball quickly. \n\"They brought pressure,\" Carr said. \"So I was throwing my 'hot.' And we just didn't execute.\" \nCarr would not elaborate. But here's what seemed to happen on the video replay: The \"hot\" receiver was Seth Roberts. And he did not read the play the same way as Carr. Roberts was supposed to cut short his crossing pattern and look for the ball. Instead, he kept running. He didn't even turn to look for Carr's delivery. Amari Cooper, the Raiders' rookie receiver, was also in the vicinity but was never a target. \nJack Del Rio, the Raiders' head coach, did not specifically point at either Carr or Roberts for the messup -- but also didn't absolve either player. \n\"From the vantage point that I saw, he was wide open,\" Del Rio said, \"and I don't know if we missed him or if he didn't look for the ball. It had a chance to be a catch and run and an explosive play and a first down and points for us ... and it turned into a pick six the other way.\" \nDavis, the Denver defender who was gifted with the ball, concurred: \"I was just in the right place.\" \nSo what are we to make of all this, in terms of Carr's ultimate potential? Del Rio, his mood set on \"simmer\" during a postgame news conference, was in no mood to put his quarterback's day in perspective. Nevertheless, Del Rio was asked if at day's end, Sunday could be considered a net plus in Carr's development, or a net minus, or another mark on the timeline with no definitive finding? \n\"I would say the latter,\" Del Rio answered. \nMaybe the best way to say it is that over the course of an afternoon, we saw both the promise and the peril of Carr. He had an excellent first half, completing 11 of 14 passes for 135 yards and one touchdown as the Raiders' took a 7-3 lead. Carr's first-half passer rating was 130.7, the best of his career — and nearly double the lousy first-half passer rating of Denver quarterback Peyton Manning (66.8), whose arm has entered the limp ramen noodle phase of its shelf life. \nThen came the second half. Denver's defense threw some curves at him with disguised coverages and blitzes. On the Raiders' first drive of the third quarter, Carr fumbled away the ball while being sacked, setting up a Broncos' field goal. He had two other drives end in punts. He could never move the offense into Denver's red zone. The only Raider second half points came on a 50-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski. \nAnd of course, that crushing pick-6. \nFor all of this, the Raiders fans sent audible boos in his direction just once — on a 4th and 19 situation with 2:38 left in the fourth quarter, when rather than throw the ball past the chains, Carr dumped off a screen pass to fullback Marcel Reece. But this was the exact play sent into the huddle by offensive coordinator Bill Musgrave. \n\"That was the call we went with,\" Carr said, defending his coach. \"I've seen a lot of those convert and stuff in situations like that. But they stopped us. They just got us.\" \nAnd his conclusion about how it fits into his progress? \n\"I don't look at it from a development standpoint,\" Carr said. \"Because I want to win. And we can. We've shown that we can. I just try and correct it and move on to the next one.\" \nThe next one is not for two weeks because the Raiders have a bye next Sunday. And while the talk about learning and needing to \"correct\" is fine for now, Carr must soon avoid having to \"correct\" so much. The Raiders should have beat Denver. Carr's interception, no matter how it happened, is why the Raiders didn't win. A learning experience? More of a lousy one. Read Mark Purdy's blog at blogs.mercurynews.com/purdy .
