The resolute athletic director sought out 77-year-old Skip Bertman for advice. It made perfect sense. Bertman, like Tanner, was a national championship baseball coach so popular with school supporters he was elevated to athletic director. “We talked for quite a while Saturday,” Tanner said Tuesday at Williams-Brice Stadium after Head Ball Coach Steve Spurrier officially announced his resignation and Tanner named offensive line coach Shawn Elliott as interim head coach. Talked? About how to go about hiring a new football coach? “I’m not going to go into the details,” Tanner said. “But yes.” Bertman, now retired, had to replace Nick Saban as LSU football coach in 2004. He lured Les Miles away from Oklahoma State. This is Tanner’s first big football decision, and he knows replacing the best coach in program history is the most important hire he will make at South Carolina. Tanner doesn’t have to land a coach that will win a national title, as Miles did at LSU. But he must leverage Spurrier’s overall progress to grab a coach that excites fans immediately — something like the way former athletic director Mike McGee raised the bar from Lou Holtz to Spurrier. The art of pursuit Tanner said Tuesday an advisory committee is being formed to assist him. He said South Carolina will hire a search firm, which always seems excessive (and expensive). The search will be extensive, Tanner added, and national. “We’ll be well prepared to move forward,” Tanner said. The odd timing of Spurrier quitting doesn’t digest well for some committed citizens, but Spurrier explained it reasonably well Tuesday; he had become part of the 2-4 problem. Now comes the fun part, though the conventional idea of luring away a sitting head coach is very new to South Carolina. Remember, Holtz and Spurrier were not in the coaching biz when South Carolina came calling. Brad Scott, hired in 1994, was Florida State’s offensive coordinator. Before that, Sparky Woods came from Appalachian State and Joe Morrison from New Mexico. Now, surely, the South Carolina job has enough advantages — proof of repeated 11-2 success, four straight bowl wins, SEC cash flow, a huge stadium, incredibly loyal fans — to land a good Power 5 coach. One slight problem: The overall player talent level that the new guy will get for the 2016 season is probably worse than what Spurrier inherited from Holtz. A short list “I’m not going to limit myself,” Tanner said, “to assistant coaches, head coaches, the NFL, longtime college coaches or anything.” That said, a wide-ranging short list of possibilities: — Kirby Smart , Alabama defensive coordinator. Makes some strategic sense. He is only 39. Might bolt for Bama if Nick Saban leaves. — Charlie Strong, Texas head coach. Might get fired or want out at Texas. He was popular as a South Carolina assistant under Holtz. Did a swell job at Louisville. Not exactly a hot commodity. — Bob Stoops, Oklahoma head coach. Close friend of the Spurrier family, and Spurrier’s former Florida defensive coordinator. P.R. problem: Recently spotted in a bowl game getting clobbered by Clemson, 40-6. — Mark Dantonio , Michigan State head coach. Former Gamecocks defensive back. Not a great recruiter, but few programs are better at player development. A bit older at 59. — Hugh Freeze, Ole Miss. A home run, but might be hard to pry a Mississippi native. — Kyle Whittingham, Utah. California native. Strong candidate for the other USC opening. — Sonny Dykes , California head coach. Don’t let the Berkeley address fool you; he’s a Texas guy and former Louisiana Tech head coach. — Tom Herman , Houston head coach; Justin Fuente , Memphis head coach; Jeff Brohm , Western Kentucky head coach. Young hot-list candidates on the rise. — Will Muschamp, Auburn defensive coordinator. Seems like a Tanner type. But, ah, that failure at Florida. — Shawn Elliott, interim head coach. He has to go at least 4-2 with a win over Clemson to be seriously considered. Tanner was the South Carolina baseball coach when Spurrier was hired just after the 2004 season. He recalls meeting with his assistant coaches that afternoon. “I said, ‘Men, today we got better,’” Tanner said. “Because the brand that Coach Spurrier brought here impacted us all. And we are in a better place than we ever have been.” Tanner’s football hire must reflect that.
