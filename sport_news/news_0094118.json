The Scarlets hadn’t beaten archrival Cliffside Park since 2011, and the Red Raiders went into the season favored to win their fourth straight Big North American title despite the graduation of four top senior runners.\nBut from the first day of practice Murri began to like his team more and more, and after the Scarlets upset an injury-riddled Cliffside Park team in a dual meet, he began to think this team could exceed expectations.\nFriday, Ridgefield Park proved its coach to be correct, placing five runners in the top 12 and comfortably defeating the defending champions, 36-48, despite a close individual win by Jason Argueta of CP over RP sophomore Derek Lewandowski. \nRidgefield Park’s boys were joined by the Don Bosco and River Dell boys and Cliffside Park, IHA and River Dell girls as division-winning teams on the final day of the three day Big North meet at Garret Mountain.\n\"These kids just kept working and working and got better each week,\" said Murri. \"Derek reminds me of a young Brendan Conway [who won the 2011 league individual title for Ridgefield Park] and Brendan is helping train him now. Derek is tough and he could end up being the best cross-country runner I’ve coached.\"\nThe other five divisions went pretty much according to form, with individual performances by girls division winners Giavanna Tabbachino of IHA (United) and Shannon Goria of River Dell (Patriot) the highlights.\nTabbachino ran 19:26, the third fastest time ever run at Garret for an IHA runner, and led the Blue Eagles to a 23-33 win over Holy Angels.\n\"I really wanted to win this,\" said Tabbachino, who ran behind now graduated all-North Jersey standouts Erin Ahearn and Colleen Buckley her first two years. \"It’s important for us to beat Holy Angels because they were close to us in the dual meet.\"\n\"Our top seven are all sophomores and juniors and we’re all close,\" said Tabbachino, a junior. \"But I know I have to be the leader because I’ve run with Erin and Colleen in the past and I like it.\"\nThen Goria, a sophomore, stepped up and ran a sizzling 19:06 to lead River Dell to a 26-34 win over Ramsey in a battle of two of North Jersey’s top teams. That time, the 18th fastest ever run by a Bergen girl at Garret, knocked Goria’s coach, Brianna Bayersdorfer out of the River Dell record book for the second time in 13 days. Goria had run 19:27 to win a race at the Shore Invitational at Holmdel on Oct. 3, breaking Bayersdorfer’s school record there as well.\nJennifer Polo of Cliffside Park was the other girls race winner, winning the American race by 300 meters in 21:00 over teammate Ilyada Erdal. But Polo was even more happy about her teammates, as the Red Raider girls won a fourth straight team title, 26-45 over Fort Lee.\n\"If I had to choose between winning individually and leading my team to a win, I’d want to lead my team to a win,\" said Polo, a senior. \"It’s my job to help us get better as a team.\"\nBosco beat Bergen Catholic, 17-42, for a sixth straight Big North United title, with Connor Nicholson edging Justin Fuhrman in identical 16:39 times for a second league title in three years.\n\"We can be the best Don Bosco team ever,\" said Nicholson, after the Ironmen sat five of its top runners. \"I’ve struggled this year but this was my best race.\"\nRiver Dell’s boys, especially their back four runners, looked terrific in a 17-63 rout of Pascack Hills in the Patriot division. Colin Daly took the win from twin brother Will in identical 16:43 times with Patrick Robertson just behind. But the back four runners, all underclassmen, ran personal bests at Garret.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:33:42.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
