To quarterback Daniel Thompson, they might as well have been a sea of tranquility. There he was, stepping down and out of one of the team buses, wearing a big grin amid the din. “Just to be able to play again, it was an amazing feeling,” he said. “I didn’t know if I was going to play, but the fact that there was a possibility I could play, I was so happy to have that chance. I just started smiling, like, ‘This is the greatest thing ever.’” Back in action for the first time in four weeks, exceedingly thankful after a neurological issue suddenly created persistent headaches and blurred vision and hijacked his playing availability, Thompson made an impact in his return to the Phoenix. The true freshman led a pair of touchdown drives and threw for 246 yards in about 2½ quarters of work, the highest passing output for an Elon quarterback in the preceding 10 games since mid-October of last year. Sure, Elon lost 37-14 and New Hampshire intercepted Thompson four times, with three coming in the fourth quarter. But given the boost of energy he provided Elon’s sputtering offense — the Phoenix trailed 34-0 before he took over in the second quarter — that performance last week could become an important foundational step in Thompson’s development. He appears in line to be Elon’s starter Saturday at Richmond and thus regain the first-string status he held to begin the season, before the emergence of a condition called spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak sacked him like a defender from the blind side. “The game was getting away and he sparked us,” Elon coach Rich Skrosky said. “I was pleased but not surprised. I think he’s a work in progress and he’s got a long, long way to go, but I think he’s going to be a good player.” The headaches surfaced from seemingly nowhere five days before Elon’s season opener. Thompson, 19, woke up hurting, but in keeping his normal routine of voracious video study, he went to Elon’s football facility at Alumni Field House to examine more clips in preparation for Wake Forest, the first opponent for the Phoenix. “I had never felt anything like it,” he said. “I was miserable. Every day I was like. ‘All right, maybe three days and it’ll be over. Maybe four days and it’ll be over. Maybe five days and it’ll be over.’ It didn’t go away.” Page 2 of 4 - Thompson practiced on, his sight fuzzy. He’d catch a glimpse of a defensive back on the run and focus on the spot from which his movement started, not the direction he was traveling. This was nothing resembling the broken left arm he suffered during his senior season at Boiling Springs (S.C.) High School, an injury that was supposed to sideline him for up to eight weeks. Instead, he came back in half that time, playing in a forearm cast and brace with his arm immobilized. “I just wanted to lay down and go to sleep,” Thompson said. “It wasn’t fun. My body was like, ‘Lay down.’ I didn’t want to do anything physical, and yet I was out here (practicing).” Still, he secured the starting job in the quarterback competition with Connor Christiansen and made his college debut on a rotating basis in the Wake Forest game, playing through the headaches and dizziness. In the days after, Dr. Hemang Shah, a neurologist at Alamance Regional Medical Center, finally delivered some clarity with the diagnosis of the condition that causes a small amount of fluid on the brain. That revelation — fluid on the brain — registered as both confusing and shocking. It’s not as if Thompson had been subjected to punishing hits in practice. Elon’s quarterbacks, in their blue non-contact jerseys, aren’t touched. And it’s not as though the self-professed football nerd had injured himself while goofing around his dorm or engaging in something foolish. His older sister has experienced migraines and his mother has dealt with vertigo, but nothing like that had affected Thompson, the younger brother of Dylan Thompson, a rookie quarterback with the San Francisco 49ers and former standout at South Carolina. “I was like, ‘Brain? Spine? What’s going on here?’” Daniel Thompson said. “When I first heard it, it was like, ‘Oh my god,’” Skrosky said. “I was scared for him. That’s scary stuff,” Christiansen said. “The first thing I thought was, ‘Are you going to be OK? Are you going to be able to play football again?’” That, of course, was among Thompson’s immediate questions and the answer that the body typically heals itself in this situation after two to four weeks obviously was vastly reassuring. “When he told me I’d be able to, that really calmed me down,” Thompson said. “In life, a couple weeks isn’t the worst thing that can ever happen. “I don’t know how it happened. I don’t know how it cleared up. But I wouldn’t wish that on anyone.” Page 3 of 4 - The doubt of last month has been replaced by the possibilities both immediate and in the future, the once helpless feelings now supplanted by Thompson’s even deeper appreciation for the sport. Three weeks ago, Skrosky wondered if the neurological issue would cost Thompson the rest of the season or worse, become a problem for the long term. Then came last week at New Hampshire, when he threw for 194 yards in the second half and spread his passes among nine receivers. It was distribution that involved many levels of the field, from underneath and intermediate routes to deep balls down the seam and over the top. “It goes back to the reasons why he was the starter at Wake Forest,” Skrosky said, acknowledging Thompson’s grasp of the playbook. “I’m thrilled for him. If what happened had been, God forbid, a permanent thing, it would be devastating to that kid. I know much he loves everything about the game. “We can’t throw four interceptions, but he did some really good things. I think maybe the thing I was most pleased with, which, I’m not surprised by, was his composure, his demeanor. We had a couple drops when he was in and that’s hard on a quarterback sometimes. His reaction to it, he didn’t let those things bring him down. If anything, he brought the guys up.” Thompson said he reached something of a comfort zone last week as Elon got untracked on offense during the final five minutes of the second quarter, momentum that was regenerated in the second half. Two of perhaps his most memorable pass plays were connections with fellow true freshmen — he wiggled away from pressure and zipped a 7-yard touchdown dart to Tereak McCray, before later avoiding danger again and stepping out of a collapsing pocket to hit Corey Joyner deep for 45 yards, setting up Elon’s second score. “The Wake Forest game, I just wasn’t right, just didn’t feel normal,” Thompson said. “This game I felt more like myself. I think it was an important game. We actually got to moving the ball on offense. It became an expectation and not a wish. I think that was something we needed as a team. “The ceiling, there’s a lot of space there for us to get better.” Indeed. And plenty of headway at work.
