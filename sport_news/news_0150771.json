But a judgment by the Punjab and Haryana High Court confirms that Haryana cops not only made attempts to supersede the trial court but also exonerated the accused before trial in a murder case could even proceed further. The castigation by Justice Rajan Gupta came after the court was told that the Haryana Police re-probed a murder case after the submission of the final report. They then tried to convert the murder offence to abetment of suicide under Section 306 of the IPC against some of the accused while absolving the rest. “It is inexplicable how re-investigation of the case was undertaken by the police after the final report was submitted under Section 302, IPC. It sought to convert the offence to Section 306, IPC, against some of the accused and exonerate the rest. No permission was sought from the court for reinvestigation of the matter. This throws serious doubts about the role of the investigation agency.” The developments took place on a petition by Fateh Singh and other petitioners for directions to the Haryana and other respondents to submit a report under section 173(8), Cr PC, pursuant to an inquiry. The court was told that the case hovered around the death of Narender. He was set ablaze in November, 2014. After completion of investigation, the final report was submitted by the investigating agency in January this year. But after the filing of the final report, an application preferred by an eyewitness, Mansa Ram, was entertained by the Jind SP. In the report submitted after re-inquiry, Safidon DSP concluded that accused Fateh Singh, Anup and Anuj were guilty of offence under Section 306, IPC, whereas Raghbir, Kuldeep and Ram Phal were innocent. An application was then moved before the trial court for re-investigation on the basis of the report but the plea was dismissed by the Jind Sessions Judge after which the Jind SP decided against presenting the supplementary challan. Dismissing the petition, Justice Gupta concluded: “The petitioner’s plea is that investigating agency ought to have submitted a report whereby three accused had been exonerated and three were held guilty under Section 306, IPC. I am not convinced with the plea…Prayer to direct the investigating agency to submit a particular report before the trial court is wholly misconceived. Petition is, thus, without any merit or substance….”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:11:57.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
