The network’s financial stake of nearly $2bn per year in the NFL has long been perceived as at odds with its journalistic mission and ability to cover the league objectively.\nIn July, HBO announced it had signed Simmons, arguably America’s most influential sports personality, to a multi-platform deal that will see him present a talk show as well as produce video podcasts and features.\nSimmons’s pact with ESPN didn’t formally end until September, but he’d been effectively silenced since May when failed negotiations over a contract extension culminated in a highly public split .\nA part-time bartender who moonlighted as an AOL blogger known as The Boston Sports Guy, Simmons parlayed his online following into an columnist job at ESPN.com in 2001. He became America’s most widely read sportswriter during more than a decade with the company, and spearheaded a series of successful ventures, including the 30 for 30 documentary film series and the launch of the sports and pop culture boutique site Grantland.com.\nAs of Thursday afternoon, Simmons’ podcast ranked No1 on the iTunes charts in the United States, which is thought to be a formula of both downloads and subscriptions.", "external_links": ["https://soundcloud.com/the-bill-simmons-podcast/ep-2-deflategate-president-trump-mlb-wjacko", "http://www.itunescharts.net/us/charts/podcasts/2015/09/30"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:11:04.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
