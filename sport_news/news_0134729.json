How he's able to do that is a topic for another day. However, during today's press conference, Belichick, in his best Buffalo Bill voice, may have accidentally struck gold in the world of social media when he asked a reporter if they were using the app \"SnapFace.\"\nNow, you're probably saying Belichick simply doesn't know the difference between Snapchat and Facebook .

He's probably just confused.\nIn other \"Belichick may actually be confused\" news, when asked about Dallas Cowboys backup Brandon Weeden, Bill said, \" He can make all the throws. I don’t think that’s an issue.\"\nGo ahead and ask your nearest diehard Cowboys fan if Weeden \"can make all the throws\" and you tell us if Belichick is confused.\nSend all complaints, compliments, and tips to sportstips@complex.com\n[via ESPN ]", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-ac87-6n3I", "http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=espn:13829477", "http://player.espn.com/player.js?pcode=1kNG061cgaoolOncv54OAO1ceO-I&width=576&height=324&externalId=espn:13829477"], "published": "2015-10-08T02:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:28:35.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
