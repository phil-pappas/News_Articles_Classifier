you’re going to throw an inning.’” \nFor a moment, Loup said he was just processing that information and what it might mean to his future, as Johnson was not exactly being forthcoming with any more details. \n“And then I asked him, ‘Does this mean I made the roster?’ And he said, ‘Yeah, you made roster.’” \nIt was a moment of immense relief for the congenial reliever, whose rickety season left him wondering if he would be cut loose just as the year is about to lift off into the stratosphere. \nFor Loup, the chance to participate in the Blue Jays’ first playoff party in more than two decades is a chance at redemption, to prove his worth after a year he would just as soon forget. \n“After a tough season for me, after what I’m used to, being able to have a good September and hopefully carry it into the postseason and help the team out as much as I can – I’m looking forward to bouncing back and being as much help as I can,” Loup said on Wednesday. \nAfter a three-day layoff that felt to many like three weeks, the Blue Jays and the Rangers are finally ready to take their battle to the baseball diamond. \nThe first game of the American League Division Series is Thursday with the first pitch at Rogers Centre slated for 3:37 p.m. (ET). \nThe early start time is to accommodate Major League Baseball’s U.S. TV partners. \nThe Rangers, the champions of the AL West Division, arrived in Toronto Tuesday night. \nBoth teams worked out at Rogers Centre on Wednesday in advance of their best-of-five affair. \nThe media presence at the stadium was overwhelming, and the interest in the AL East winners is off the charts, with the Blue Jays about to end a 22-year playoff absence. \nPlayers in the usually spacious Toronto clubhouse could barely edge their way through the media throngs. \nLaTroy Hawkins, the veteran Blue Jays reliever, didn’t even bother with any pretense of patience as he bulled his way through. \n“Beep, beep, beep, beep,” Hawkins said as he steered his way through the crowds. \n“Precious cargo coming through.” \nAnd Loup was only too happy to be a part of all the mayhem, although his inclusion as a member of the Jays’ seven-man bullpen for the first round of the playoffs was a bit surprising to some. \nIt helped Loup that he throws left-handed. \nHe and Brett Cecil will be the only bullpen southpaws that Gibbons will be able to call on against a pretty good Texas batting lineup that features several dangerous left-handed hitters, including Josh Hamilton, Shin-Soo Choo and Prince Fielder. \nAfter an outstanding 2014, during which he was a dependable presence out of the pen, Loup has struggled most of this season. \nHis record is 2-5 and his earned-run average is up to 4.46, more than a full point over his 2014 ERA. \nHe has hit six batters this season, all lefties, and in mid-August Loup was optioned to Toronto’s Triple-A affiliate in Buffalo to try to work out the kinks. \nHe was back with the big-league club two weeks later as part of the team’s September call-ups and pitched better. He allowed no runs off seven hits over six innings over the final month of the season. \n“For the most part they’re going to be a tough group,” Loup said of the coming Texas tango. \n“I’ve faced a little bit of them all and had some success against some of them. Some guys got a few hits off me, but I think for the most part, as long as I make my pitches and stay out of the middle of the plate, I’ll be all right.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:27:44.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
