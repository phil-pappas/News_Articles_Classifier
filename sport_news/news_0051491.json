Especially when said meat has been deliciously processed into strip or tube form.\nThe study was conducted by a 22-member panel of experts/killjoys from 10 different countries (probably all jealous of America’s Spambundance of processed meats) who reviewed hundreds of research reports that found links between processed meat or red meat and various types of cancer.\nOn behalf of all Americans, allow me to say this: “Shut up, World Health Organization. Shut your stupid, baconless mouth.”\nWHO: Processed meats can lead to cancer The World Health Organization's (WHO) cancer agency says processed meats such as ham and sausage can lead to colon and other cancers, and red meat is probably cancer-causing as well.

(AP)\nSee more videos Or, as Shalene McNeill, executive director of human nutrition at the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, told the Washington Post : “We simply don't think the evidence supports any causal link between any red meat and any type of cancer.\"\nThere you have it — case closed.\nWho are you going to trust when it comes to deciding what kind of succulent meat to put next to your cheese-covered eggs or into your soon-to-be-piled-high sandwich? A bunch of international science nerds in the pocket of Big Kale or a true-blue American who works closely with actual, patriotic meat?\nLogically, you trust the meat people.\nIn this case, however, I don’t think a strongly worded “Cram it!” is sufficient. America needs to respond swiftly and forcefully to this threat to our way of life/death.\nThat’s why I’m calling on President Barack Obama to invade the World Health Organization and stop this sausage slander in its tracks.\nWithout a crushing response, Americans will have to endure hate speech like this tweet from the WHO’s Twitter account: “Processed meat refers to meat that has been salted, cured, fermented, smoked, other processes to enhance flavour or improve preservation.”\nWHO THE HELL SPELLS “FLAVOR” WITH A “U”?!?!\nMy concern, of course, is that Obama is notoriously soft on meat terrorism. So I sent a tweet to the two leading presidential candidates in each party — Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, Donald Trump and Ben Carson — asking: “As president, will you swear to destroy the WHO for #CrimesAgainstBacon?”\nWe cannot sit back and let the foreign WHO take our meat. Next thing you know they’ll have us eating those gross green things that grow in the ground. Vargtorbles? Vladchibulls? Something communist-sounding like that.\nStay strong, fellow Americans. Those Swiss bastards can have our Slim Jims and defibrillators when they pry them from our cold, dead hands.\nrhuppke@tribpub.com\n Colon Cancer Barack Obama", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562e714d/turbine/ct-processed-meat-cancer-who-video-20151026", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562e67bc/turbine/ct-who-bacon-cancer-huppke-20151026", "http://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2015/pdfs/pr240_E.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-26T19:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:08:01.808+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
