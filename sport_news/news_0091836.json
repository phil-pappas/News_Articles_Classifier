A tight left hamstring kept him sidelined for all six of the Nets’ preseason games.\nNow, with one week to go to the start of the regular season, it is unsurprisingly unclear if Bargnani will be available when the Nets face the Bulls in Brooklyn next Wednesday.\nAsked directly three separate times if he was going to play, Bargnani gave a similar non-answer each time.\n“I’m positive about it,” Bargnani said after Wednesday’s practice at the team’s New Jersey facility. “I feel pretty good, and I think we’re doing pretty good. Tomorrow I’m going to do even more.”\nBargnani may have said he’s going to do more Thursday, but let’s be honest: at this point, it’s clearly a wait-and-see situation. He participated fully in the week of training camp practices at Duke University — only for the Nets to announce Oct. 5, the day they were set to open the preseason, that Bargnani would sit out with a “tight” left hamstring.\nAn MRI exam didn’t reveal anything, and thus began a more than two-week long odyssey that has seen Bargnani shift from not practicing to partial participation several times.\nHere’s how the last several days played out: Partial practice Oct. 11, not listed on the injury report Oct. 12, out Oct. 13 against the Celtics, off Oct. 14, partial practice Friday. He was out of Saturday’s practice and games Sunday at home against Philadelphia and Monday in Boston and then off Tuesday before Wednesday’s partial practice.\nSo did he have a setback?\n“I think overall I just had a very small setback,” Bargnani said. “It always got better. I kept building every day, so I feel pretty good about it.”\nHe didn’t feel good enough, however, to say he’s definitely going to play in the opener, and coach Lionel Hollins — who was excited about Bargnani’s potential when he was on the court during training camp — admitted he didn’t know, either.\n“I hope he will,” Hollins said. “I just want him to come and be healthy and play at full speed, play up to his capabilities.”\nBargnani’s status puts the Nets in a precarious position, as the team currently has three healthy big men — Brook Lopez, Thaddeus Young and Thomas Robinson — with Bargnani, Willie Reed (thumb surgery) and rookie Chris McCullough (knee surgery) all out.\nThat could impact how the Nets fill out the final spots on their roster, as it will be tough to go through the first month of the regular season with just four bigs — Reed is out at least until December, while McCullough is out longer — if one is Bargnani. The ex-Knick missed 49 of the first 51 games last year with hamstring and calf injuries, and has been perpetually injured for the past four years.\n“It’s very frustrating, very frustrating, but it is what is,” Bargnani said. “But you have to know where your body is, because you have to be ready for the first game. It’s very frustrating to not have played in the preseason games.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under andrea bargnani ,  brooklyn nets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:21:29.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
