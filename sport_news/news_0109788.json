Coach Rich Skrosky said both Connor Christiansen and Daniel Thompson are likely to play Saturday against Colonial Athletic Association foe New Hampshire, a move that would return Elon to the platoon system it used at the outset of the season. “Now how much, what the rotation’s going to be, I have no idea,” Skrosky said. “It’s hard to say. I really don’t know that part of it.” The Phoenix has gone 2-1 during the last three games with Christiansen, the left-handed redshirt freshman, at the quarterbacking controls from start to finish and is coming off last week’s encouraging defeat of Towson, Elon’s first-ever victory in the league it joined last summer. Thompson, the right-handed true freshman, hasn’t been in uniform since the season opener — he started ahead of Christiansen that night at Wake Forest — while recovering from a neurological issue that caused persistent headaches and a small amount of fluid on his brain. Thompson resumed participating in practices last week, a significant step after facing uncertainty that had put the possibility of him playing again this season in question. “He’s been locked in,” Skrosky said of Thompson. “He’s watched tape the last two weeks as if he was starting. He’s here in the morning. He’s here at night.” Christiansen has completed 57.1 percent of his passes for an average of 130.7 yards per game in Elon’s victories against Gardner-Webb (21-13 in triple overtime) and Towson (17-13) and loss to North Carolina A&T (14-7) during the last three weeks — all close, defense-driven games that remained in doubt until the final seconds. He has connected on three touchdown passes and run for another score while not throwing an interception in that span. He also has become Elon’s leading rusher, utilizing his mobile ability to gain 112 yards on 41 carries and thus provide an element that poses an additional threat for opposing defenses. Christiansen certainly hasn’t conducted offensive masterpieces. But with the Phoenix having won two of its last three games and perhaps harnessing a sense of long-sought momentum, why not keep him in as the full-time quarterback? “If we were humming, I would feel that way,” Skrosky said. “If we were executing at a very high level, if we were very efficient on first-and-10, I would feel that way.” Skrosky said Christiansen has made improving strides while showing increasing comfort with the offense and a competitive streak that has generated confidence among his teammates. Page 2 of 2 - “I feel like I’ve gotten better every game,” Christiansen said. “I’ve definitely become more comfortable and more confident, and I want that to keep continuing. I want to really challenge myself against a good team and a really good defense like UNH and see what I’m able to do. “So I’m looking forward to Saturday. Whoever plays, who cares? I hope we both dominate. I hope we keep making it more difficult for the coaches.” Kickoff Who: Elon (2-2, 1-0) at No. 20 New Hampshire (2-2, 0-1) When: 3:30 p.m. Saturday Where: Cowell Stadium, Durham, N.H.
