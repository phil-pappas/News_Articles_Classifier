His impending trial for tax fraud against Spanish authorities won't stop him from being Barcelona's poster boy.\nAfter it emerged that Lionel Messi and his father will go to court accused of defrauding the tax authorities of more than €4 million – despite prosecutors pleading for the charges to be dropped – FC Barcelona have issued a statement backing their star man.\nThe club gave a three-point response to the charges against Messi:\n\"1.- The Club expresses its surprise at the difference in criteria between the Public Prosecutors, which on September 25 decided not to accuse Lionel Messi of tax fraud, and the verdict expressed today by the State Attorney, which states the complete opposite.\n2.- FC Barcelona has expressed its affection and solidarity to Leo Messi and his family in such a peculiar situation. The Club shall continue to offer him and his family its full support and assistance in the legal, fiscal and administrative aspects of these proceedings.\n3.- FC Barcelona decries the accumulation of totally inadmissible and external decisions that have been going on for some time, and that have nothing to with strictly sporting affairs. They are damaging to the good operations of the Club, its stability and also that of the athletes that form part of it. The Club shall be working with more determination than ever to defend its legitimate rights and is ready for any new challenges that might arise.\"\nMessi isn't the only Barca player to be targeted by the tax man.\nIn addition to Messi, Barca stars Neymar and Javier Mascherano are both caught up in similar cases, which has fed into some conspiracy theories that Barcelona are being unfairly targeted .\nDefender Javier Mascherano has been chased by Spanish authorities for allegedly defrauding the state of €1.5 million, while Neymar is in trouble with Brazil for supposedly failing to pay a huge €14.1 million.\nWe shouldn't be surprised that Barcelona want to keep the world's greatest player on their side.\n[via FC Barcelona ]", "external_links": ["http://www.fcbarcelona.com/club/detail/article/fc-barcelona-to-give-full-support-to-leo-messi", "https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/sport/football/barca-claim-real-conspiracy-theory-over-neymar-tax-probe-6228342"], "published": "2015-10-09T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:22:05.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
