So I am not going into any threat perception. The fact is that India will also host the T20 World Cup in 2016 and it is the responsibility of every Indian to keep our image of sportmanship alive,” Thakur said. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:49:36.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
