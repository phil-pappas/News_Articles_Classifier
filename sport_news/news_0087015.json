Spiller did vs. Dallas last week.\n•    WR: Kamar Aiken, Ravens vs. Browns ($3,800) — If Aiken can do half of what Steve Smith Sr. did, he’ll be a steal.\n•      WR: Keenan Allen, Chargers vs. Steelers ($7,200) — Should be a field day vs. this secondary. Big reception total coming.\n•     WR: Julian Edelman, Patriots at Cowboys ($7,000) — Like all rival defenses, Dallas will focus on Gronk, leaving Edelman room to roam.\n•     TE: Charles Clay, Bills at Titans ($4,100) — Tyrod Taylor’s go-to-guy has either had a TD or 100 yards receiving in the last three games.\n•    Flex: Todd Gurley, Rams at Packers ($4,300) — Should go bonkers vs. a ‘D’ allowing 4.8 yards a carry.\n•      D/ST: Giants vs. 49ers ($2,900) — At home and going up against turnover-happy Colin Kaepernick.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:34:12.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
