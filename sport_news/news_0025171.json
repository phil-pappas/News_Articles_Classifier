WEXLER/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER A wrestler and gymnast? Ayanna Ervin is not your usual two-sport athlete. Ayanna Ervin has a way of grabbing people’s attention.\nIt may not be obvious when she performs in a gymnastics meet. The Clifton senior only started competing when she reached high school and is in it mainly for love of the sport.\nStart a conversation with Ervin, though, and it won’t be long before some eye-opening fact is revealed.\n\"She came into the gym one day, and she was wearing a Clifton wrestling sweatshirt,\" said Mustangs coach Brittany Gaccione, recalling a 2014 exchange. \"Ayanna said, ‘Oh, it’s my boyfriend’s. We used to wrestle together.’ \n\"And I was like, ‘Say what?’ \"\nAs Gaccione found out, Ervin competed in both gymnastics and wrestling as a Clifton freshman. The story of her career in the latter is another double-take special.\n\"I started doing it because there weren’t any sports for middle-schoolers in Germany besides wrestling,\" Ervin said matter-of-factly, again piquing the listener’s interest.\n\"I’m a military child, so I spent my middle-school years in Germany,\" she explained. \"And since I’m very athletic, I decided to do wrestling. I liked it a lot, so I came back to Clifton and joined the team.\"\nErvin, 17, was born in Passaic and calls Clifton home. But thanks to her father Vernard’s career in the Army and Marines, her family has boomeranged in and out of North Jersey close to a dozen times.\n\"I’ve lived across the United States – Texas, Missouri, North Carolina, Florida, California, New York, Georgia. The list goes on and on,\" she said. \"And I did half of my sophomore year in Missouri.\"\nThat stop included the highlight of her wrestling career. After competing in four varsity matches as a Clifton frosh, she logged much more mat time at Waynesville (Mo.), where she scored her first pin – a victory now preserved in a YouTube video.\nSince Waynesville did not offer gymnastics, Ervin wound up back at square one when she rejoined the Mustangs for her junior year. Yet the layoff did not dampen her enthusiasm.\n\"She came up to me on the first day of practice, telling me, ‘I wasn’t on the team last year, but I was as a freshman, and I really want to be a captain,’ \" Gaccione said. \"At first I thought, ‘Whoa, OK then.’ \n\"But even though I did not make her a captain last year, she didn’t let that discourage her from still wanting to take on a leadership role, which I really admired.\"\nErvin earned All-Passaic honorable mention after a career-best vault of 7.6 at last year’s county meet. This season, she is a quad-captain along with senior twins Samantha and Kristen Wong and Francine Choy.\nVault and the uneven bars remain the two events in which she contributes to team scoring, which she’ll get to do twice more this week. Wednesday’s Passaic County championships and next Monday’s NJGL B Division meet will be the finale of her gymnastics career. A potential return to the wrestling team is undecided.\nYou see, Ervin has gotten a jump-start on her post-high school plans.\n\"I’m currently running ‘Spiritual Blueprint,’ a personal development business,\" she said, noting that she must wait until she turns 18 next month to incorporate officially. \"My main goal is to become a motivational speaker, and motivate people to improve themselves, reach their highest potential and achieve things that they feel are worthwhile.\"\nShe certainly won’t have trouble capturing the attention of her audience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:47:39.313+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
