Mark Gonzales Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Cubs slug playoff-record six home runs to move to within one win of NLCS. \nDriving past the Cubby Bear on Monday revived colorful memories for Joe Maddon, where he spoke boldly about reaching the playoffs and setting high goals for an 89-loss team at his introductory news conference nearly 12 months ago. \n\"To come full circle within a year is kind of amazing in this particular moment with all this at stake,\" Maddon said before the Cubs moved within one game of advancing to the National League Championship Series. \n\"This is what you work for. This is wonderful.\" \nDespite a far-from-perfect performance from Jake Arrieta, the Cubs pounded the Cardinals for a record six home runs to pull away to an 8-6 victory at gusty Wrigley Field and take a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five NL Division Series. \nThe Cubs can clinch the series Tuesday with Jason Hammel opposing the Cardinals' John Lackey, who will be starting on three days' rest. \n\"We want to stay here,\" said reliever Pedro Strop, who conquered a demon by pitching a perfect eighth inning. \"We don't want to go back\" to St. Louis for a fifth game. \nThe first six batters in the Cubs order — Dexter Fowler, Jorge Soler, Kris Bryant, Anthony Rizzo, Starlin Castro and Kyle Schwarber — took advantage of strong gusts to each hit a home run to set a postseason record. \nSoler continued his revival after a power-deprived, injury-riddled season by hitting a single that preceded Bryant's two-run homer in the fifth, and then he lined a two-run homer off Adam Wainwright in the sixth that stretched the Cubs' lead to 7-4. \nSoler became the first player in major-league history to reach base safely in his first nine postseason plate appearances. \n\"It's nice for our offense to be able to do that and have some confidence going into Tuesday,\" Arrieta said. \nArrieta saw his scoreless streak end at 34 innings. He was pulled after 52/3 innings and four runs allowed — equaling the most he has allowed since the start of August. \n\"I got into situations where I had some uncharacteristic things happened, but they picked me up,\" he said. \nArrieta credited the Cardinals hitters, who challenged his array of sharp breaking pitches. He got into trouble when he walked two batters to start the fourth. Arrieta hadn't allowed two walks in a start since Sept. 11 at Philadelphia. \n\"They're an incredible offensive club,\" said Arrieta, who survived a two-run homer to Jason Heyward in the sixth to earn the win. \"They laid off sliders and cutters early in the count, made me come in the zone with more hittable pitches. They were able to capitalize on two walks.\" \nArrieta struck out nine. \n\"I guess it was about time for him not to have a quality start,\" catcher Miguel Montero said. \"He's actually human. He still gave us a chance to win.\" \nBryant and Rizzo snapped out of a collective 0-for-21 slump in a convincing manner. Bryant had two hits, including a two-run homer in the fifth that gave the Cubs a 4-2 lead and knocked out Michael Wacha, and Rizzo followed a solo shot off left-hander Kevin Siegrist. \nThis isn't about anyone,\" Rizzo said. \"It's about us, the whole team.\" \nRelievers Clayton Richard, Trevor Cahill, Travis Wood and Strop combined for 21/3 scoreless innings. \nThe only potentially discouraging news was that shortstop Addison Russell left in the fourth with left hamstring tightness after legging out a triple. \n\"I felt a little grab,\" Russell said. \"I didn't want to put my team in a sticky situation.\" \nRussell said he was day to day and wasn't sure if he would undergo an MRI on Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T07:35:22.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
