Latest Rangers stories Rangers shut down again by Price, Canadiens \nAll that helped backup goaltender Antti Raanta, steady all evening, win his New York debut as the Rangers avoided their first four-game losing streak since December 2013. \nRaanta made 22 saves, with his 17th at 6:52 of the third period on Tomas Hertl, stopping his redirection with his pad, among his best. He was named the first star. \n\"It's nice to get this kind of start,\" Raanta said. \"I knew what Cam Talbot meant here last year, and everybody's compared me to him, everybody's always expecting that you have to be better than the last one was.\" Rangers Rangers vs. Sharks \nSupported by the goals -- the Rangers had scored only two in the previous three games -- Raanta got his fourth career shutout. The other three were with Chicago, who sent him to the Rangers for Ryan Haggerty in a draft-day swap after Talbot was traded to Edmonton. \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nIt was a smooth opening for Raanta, the second Finnish goalie to play for the team -- the first was Jussi Markkanen in 2003-04. Raanta stopped all nine shots he faced in the first period. \n\"It's urgency, Rick Nash said of snapping the three-game losing streak. \"Good teams don't let these things slide, they stop them right away. I believe we're a good team.\" \nMarc Staal's high wrister from the point that eluded Martin Jones on his stick side at 10:36 provided a 1-0 lead. In first periods this season, the Rangers have scored 10 goals. Derick Brassard and Fast received assists on Staal's first goal; it was Brassard's third point and Fast's first. \n\"We got the lead and we talked about not taking a step back, Ryan McDonagh said. \"[We were] trying to play with the same pace, trying to keep on our toes.\" \nBoth Nash and Chris Kreider, who had been without a goal in the first six games, had some jump in the first period, and managed three shots each on Jones. Both hit the post in the third period. Nash also drilled Sharks defenseman Justin Braun into the boards near the Zamboni entrance in the first. \nIn the second period, the Rangers faced a five-on-three for 22 seconds. With Dan Boyle in the box, Staal was whistled for a trip at 3:08, and Raanta made a toe save when Joe Thornton tried to thread a pass through the slot. Dominic Moore and Derek Stepan also created scoring chances on the five-on-four penalty kill, forcing saves by Jones. \nWhen Viktor Stalberg, who scored at 16:44 of the third period, drew a tripping call along the boards on Dylan DeMelo at 9:02, the Rangers took just 26 seconds to strike. Nash posted up in front of Jones, and Mats Zuccarello's shot squeezed in past the right post. His fourth goal gave the Rangers a 2-0 lead. \n\"All I was thinking today was to win, Raanta said. \"I think everybody showed up and that helped me a lot.\" \nSubscribe to Newsdayâ€™s sports newsletter for stories, photos and videos about your favorite New York teams plus national sports news and events.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:10:27.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
