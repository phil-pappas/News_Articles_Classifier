It was a great win, but that’s what we expect.”\nBritain Covey caught two touchdown passes for the Utes (6-1, 3-1), whose eight-game winning streak ended.\nSmith, USC’s dynamic freshman linebacker, led a fine defensive performance by picking off Travis Wilson three times for a combined 122 yards, including his scoring romp down the USC sideline 1:07 before halftime. Wilson was picked four times in all.\n“Any time a big play happens, the whole team feels it,” Smith said. “We piggyback on each other and make more big plays.”\nUtah was second in the nation in turnover margin entering the game, forcing\n19 turnovers and committing just seven. The Trojans erased that advantage thanks to Smith, the first USC player with three interceptions in a game since Jason Oliver in 1991 against Penn State.\nUtah also inexplicably failed to establish its running game against USC, which had been bullied up front this season. Star tailback Devontae Booker had just\n14 carries for 62 yards.\nUSC, which lost its previous two home games to Stanford and Washington, kept Utah winless in Los Angeles since 1916.\nThe Trojans were outstanding in their first appearance at the Coliseum since an embarrassing loss to Washington and the subsequent firing of coach Steve Sarkisian nearly two weeks ago.\nThe tumult-plagued Trojans entered the night as slight betting favorites against the powerful Utes, and USC proved Vegas’ prescience with an excellent game plan that largely played to its strengths. Jones and Davis combined for 139 yards rushing, and Smith led an aggressive defensive effort that limited Utah to 213 yards in the first three quarters.\nUSC went 88 yards for Davis’ TD run on its opening drive, but Utah answered with a 30-yard TD catch by Covey, a 5-foot-8 freshman.\nThe Trojans evened it after Smith’s 41-yard interception return led to Vainuku’s fourth-down TD dive, and they took the lead on an 18-yard TD run up the middle by Jones. Moments later, Smith took his second interception to the house, putting the Trojans up 28-14.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T10:37:14.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
