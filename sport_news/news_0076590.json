As last week's inaugural Democratic presidential debate approached, CNN's cameras lingered over an extra lectern reserved (to no avail) for Vice President Biden, as if the unused piece of furniture possessed a talismanic power to conjure a real contest.\nAlthough any presidential politicking that takes place more than a year before the election is of debatable import, the Biden bubble is worth examining. The longtime Delaware senator has twice offered himself to his party as a candidate for the top job without generating anything approaching the reception that has greeted his noncandidacy in a nonelection year. And while his tenure as the national No. 2 has certainly raised his profile, it has done so by association with an administration regarded with increasing fatigue beyond the party faithful. Contrary to all the excitement, that would be one of several significant political obstacles in his path.\nA heretofore similarly inexplicable fervor has fueled the rise of Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who is almost as unlikely to win the Democratic nomination as an empty lectern. Sanders ably embodies the left's frustration with the wealthy, particularly the wealthy person leading the Democratic field. He is also far enough from the American center that he has refused, at least nominally, to be a member of the Senate's Democratic minority; the Democrats have returned the favor by steering clear of most of his legislation.\nSanders put a statesmanlike sentiment in blunt, Brooklyn-accented terms last week when he told Hillary Clinton that \"the American people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails.\" That is no doubt true, but weariness over the slow-motion scandal is not easily separated from wariness about the would-be Clinton dynasty.\nThe former secretary of state's dubious decision to keep all her electronic communications on a private server in Chappaqua serves as a nagging reminder of her inevitable weaknesses as a general election candidate. The same can be said of her recent foxhole conversion to opposition to the transpacific free-trade deal she promoted a few years ago. Sanders has benefited from an appearance of authenticity in contrast with such Clintonian calculations.\nBut while Sanders is proving unexpectedly competitive in early-voting states, he hasn't fundamentally changed a Democratic race that has been dominated by a single candidate all along. The Biden boom reflects latent longing for an alternative possessed of Sanders' liberal energy and Clinton's political plausibility - a role that none of the other three candidates who joined them on stage seemed likely to fill. In that light, CNN's lonely lectern aptly captured the Democratic contest - or, more to the point, the lack thereof.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:20:06.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
