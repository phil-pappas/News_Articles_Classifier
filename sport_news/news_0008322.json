(AP Photo/Gary Wiepert) The pressure continues to build for the NFL’s elite.\nFor the first time in NFL history, six undefeated squads enter Week 6. Yes, that’s six teams without a single blemish on their respective records. It’s six teams that have withstood all tests the league could throw at them and come away unscathed. With over a quarter of the season over, each and every one of these teams is already looking at one of two options: the playoffs, or a collapse of historic proportions.\nA few weeks ago, we talked about separating the men from the boys, and these six metaphorical “men” stepped forward.\nThen, last week, we talked about many of these teams (and others who aspire to be in the top tier, as well) being tested in unique ways, and yet they passed. It wasn’t that every single team passed with flying colors—the Atlanta Falcons went to the wire with Washington, as did the Denver Broncos and the Cincinnati Bengals with the Oakland Raiders and Seattle Seahawks.\nStill, when the only real measure for success is the crooked numbers in the win column, being 4-0 or 5-0 at this point is phenomenal no matter how one slices it.\nIf Week 5 was the big test, Week 6 is the assignment the teacher casually mentions and one or two of these teams won’t really be prepared for.\nTrap games are typically opponents that are taken too lightly—often on the road—who relish the opportunity to take the upset and wrap themselves in it as a way to succeed even though they might only have a few other wins to their name. It’s what Oakland and Washington tried to do last week and what Pittsburgh, New Orleans, Cleveland and Indianapolis (among others) will try to do this week.\nWill any of the NFL’s best find themselves with a loss?\n© John Froschauer/AP Photo Chicago Bears' Jay Cutler in action against the Seattle Seahawks in the first half of a preseason NFL football game, Friday, Aug. 22, 2014, in Seattle. Chicago Bears at Detroit Lions ( 1 p.m. ET)\nWhy Chicago Could Win: The Bears showed a lot of “grittiness” (I hate that term, as it’s overused in sports) with their comeback win last week—a game they had every reason to lose. It goes to show that head coach John Fox and his coaching staff can put their team in a place to succeed, even against their team’s best efforts to scuttle the ship. If the team plays like they did in the second half last week, and QB Jay Cutler ($7500) continues to play even relatively mistake-free football, this is an easy road win.\nWhy Detroit Could Win: For Detroit to win, this isn’t about continuing anything or getting anything back. This offense needs to play far, far better than it has so far this season. QB Matthew Stafford has failed in terms of getting the ball down the field and also misfiring on intermediate passes that dominated defenses last season. That means not only WR Calvin Johnson, but also Golden Tate, have been huge disappointments for Lions fans and fantasy players this year. We can talk about their defense or running game all we want, but if this team doesn’t get more out of the pass game, they’re not winning this or any game.\nPrediction: Detroit— A bare look at stats shows the Bears to be a pretty solid pass defense, giving up only 185 passing yards a game. However, the context of that stat is plenty of games where the Bears have allowed teams to get early leads (and thus didn’t need to pass). The truth is: Detroit is at home against another team that can’t score any points, so they’re the better play here.\n© Kamil Krzaczynski Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald (11) scores a touchdown against Chicago Bears cornerback Terrance Mitchell (20) and strong safety Antrel Rolle (26) during the second half of the NFL game at Soldier Field. Washington at New York Jets (1 p.m. ET)\nWhy Washington Could Win: Honestly, with the way Washington went toe-to-toe with the Falcons last week, I’m surprised more experts aren’t giving Washington a puncher’s chance here. Washington has a really good rushing defense (12th in the league) and should win multiple matchups along that front. With the possibility of WR DeSean Jackson (Questionable, Hamstring) playing, this team may go toe-to-toe with the formidable Jets defense.\nWhy New York Could Win: It’s more-than-reasonable to consider this a matchup with two solid defenses who lack scoring punch on the offensive side of the ball. However, the Jets’ offense has been four points per game better than Washington this season and their defense is (especially in terms of passing defense) much more easily feared. Running will be difficult in this one, but QB Ryan Fitzpatrick could end up being a solid value this week.\nPrediction: New York— This sort of game is right in the Jets’ wheelhouse. With both teams playing ball control/safe ball, the Jets defense should win the day here.\nArizona Cardinals at Pittsburgh Steelers (1 p.m. ET)\nWhy Arizona Could Win: Yeah, the Cardinals’ defense has continued to play well with Todd Bowles now in New York, but that’s not why they’re winning games. For a better view, consider that our friends at numberFire called Arizona the no. 1 offense in all of football :\nThe Cardinals have seem to have found the Fountain of Youth in Arizona.\nThree players who many thought were past their primes coming into the 2015 season in 35-year old Carson Palmer, 32-yard old Larry Fitzgerald, and 30-year old Chris Johnson have powered this squad to the top of the offensive rankings.\nBoasting a squad overflowing with talent, the Cardinals have the most efficient overall offense according to our schedule-adjusted metrics.\nWith Palmer and Co. continuing to play that well, there’s little stopping them.\nWhy Pittsburgh Could Win: Meanwhile, the opposite is true for Pittsburgh. While so many want to talk about their offense (and, it was one of the top offenses with QB Ben Roethlisberger (Doubtful, Knee) at the helm), the Steelers defense has been keeping them in games while QB Mike Vick has been pressed into duty. The Steelers are only allowing 19 points per game, and may stymie the Cardinals with a pass rush which is similar (if not quite as dynamic) at the St. Louis Rams.\nPrediction: Arizona— This one looks like a high-scoring blowout on paper, but give me the Cardinals in a lower-scoring affair where their run game (and not Bruce Arians’ high-flying passing attack) wins the day.\n© Andy Lyons/Getty Images Andy Dalton of the Cincinnati Bengals warms up prior to the start of the game against the Seattle Seahawks at Paul Brown Stadium on October 11, 2015 in Cincinnati, Ohio. Kansas City Chiefs at Minnesota Vikings (1 p.m. ET)\nWhy Kansas City Could Win: Kansas City’s defense is currently one of the worst in football. I’ve called out head coach Andy Reid because of the offense’s ineptitude, but the offense is a known (terrible) commodity. For the Chiefs to beat the Vikings, they need to get their highly-paid pass rush revved up (only 11 sacks in 2015) and start creating more turnovers (only four takeaways!). Failing that, I don’t care how well the offense plays. They can’t win with a defense that putrid.\nWhy Minnesota Could Win: The Vikings’ defense is only giving up 18.2 points per game, but that almost assuredly has more to do with RB Adrian Peterson than the actual talent on the defense. Peterson speeds up the game clock, while slowing the Vikings offense down.\nThat’s good for the Vikings, as FanDuel’s Brandon Marianne Lee looked at why QB Teddy Bridgewater might have a rough day:\nSo far this season, the Chiefs have given up the absolute most points to opposing quarterbacks and wide receivers. Unfortunately, Teddy Bridgewater and his receiving corps have struggled mightily in 2015.\nMinnesota is coming back from a bye, so perhaps they used the time off to get things together.\nPrediction: Minnesota— Without RB Jamaal Charles (IR, Knee), the Chiefs are going to flounder in this one. Look for Peterson to do great thanks to plenty of garbage-time carries.\nCincinnati Bengals at Buffalo Bills (1 p.m. ET)\nWhy Cincinnati Could Win: I wholeheartedly believe the Bengals are the most talented team—top-to-bottom—in the entire NFL. That’s just an opinion, though. Objectively, the fellas at numberFire took a look at Cincinnati’s passing attack, which is their most efficient in the league:\nBehind [QB Andy] Dalton and the league’s most efficient passing attack according to our metrics, the Bengals have found themselves with the fourth-most efficient overall offense in the league, leading to a 421.4 total yards per game.\nThey’ve got Pro Bowl wideout A.J. Green and Marvin Jones lining up on the outside and Tyler Eifertfinally healthy and rounding into the dominant form the Bengals expected when they expected when they drafted him back in 2013. And of course they have a pair of stud running backs in Jeremy Hill and Giovani Bernard in the backfield, too.\nThe Bills are only giving up 200 passing yards per game, but they’re winning matchups in the trenches, and the Bengals are going to ride their top-notch pass-blocking line to victory.\nWhy Buffalo Could Win: With QB EJ Manuel almost certainly starting under center, the Bills may not have much of a chance, but it’s notable that Manuel is actually numberFire’s best value at any position for Week 6. Now, that doesn’t mean he’s worth a start, because “value” in this sense is like finding something completely broken and almost entirely worthless at a dollar store.\nIf the Bills can find a way to win, it’ll be that great passing defense and defensive line mentioned above. It’s a tough matchup for them, but it’s strength-on-strength at home.\nPrediction: Cincinnati— Even on the road…even against a tough Bills defense…even with an inability to shake the feeling that Dalton is “due” for a bad game, I can’t take a Manuel-led team over the Bengals.\n© Chris Humphreys/USA TODAY Sports Sep 13, 2015; Denver, CO, USA; Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning throws the ball during the first half against the Baltimore Ravens at Sports Authority Field at Mile High. Denver Broncos at Cleveland Browns ( 1 p.m. ET)\nWhy Denver Could Win: Obviously, it’s been the Broncos defense that has been running roughshod, but looking forward, FanDuel’s Eric Mack looked at the possibility of the Broncos running game getting a boost against Cleveland:\nIf Lacy is too pricey for a “bargain,” how about jumping on the anti-hype of C.J. Anderson ($6,600) or Ronnie Hillman of the struggling Denver Broncos running game? They face a Cleveland Browns run defense that is last against fantasy running backs. This is a good time to turn the hype around and catch some production from a seemingly unlikely source.\nWhy Cleveland Could Win: Of all the trap games this week, this game might actually be the “trapiest.” (That’s totally a word.) The Browns’ offense has been just better than average this season, but has exploded in comparison in recent weeks. QB Josh McCown has become not only steady, but near explosive at times, and the Browns may not have a ton of talent, but they have enough in comparison to an offense as tepid as the Broncos. If the Browns are at their very best and things go very poorly for the Broncos, this could be a turning point.\nPrediction: Denver— The Broncos are one drop in QB Peyton Manning’s production, one injury along the offensive line or one defensive miscue away from a terrible game like a loss against the Browns would be. I don’t think that happens here, but it very well could sooner rather than later, and I’m leaving it up to your imagination.\nHouston Texans at Jacksonville Jaguars (1 p.m. ET)\nWhy Houston Could Win: Because it’s Jacksonville?\nNo, seriously, though Houston has been a disappointment this season, and though there’s some lingering thoughts that maybe the Jaguars will shake out of their decade-long funk sooner or later, the Texans should handle this game rather well. RB Arian Foster got plenty of touches last week and though he didn’t look like the Foster of old, a game against the Jaguars could be exactly what he needs to get right.\nWhy Jacksonville Could Win: Because it’s Houston?\nQB Blake Bortles was phenomenal last week, and this Houston defense is giving up the eighth most points to quarterbacks this season. Meanwhile, TE Julius Thomas was eased back into the offense last week, but could see a much higher target number against Houston.\nPrediction: Houston— This is a coin flip game, and though I don’t really trust either team and usually go with the home team in these situations, the feeling that Foster could go off in this one is just too strong.\n© Grant Halverson/Getty Images Cam Newton #1 of the Carolina Panthers rushes for a fourth quarter touchdown against the New Orleans Saints during their game at Bank of America Stadium on September 27, 2015 in Charlotte, North Carolina. Miami Dolphins at Tennessee Titans ( 1 p.m. ET)\nWhy Miami Could Win: It’s really anybody’s guess as to what this team is going to look like with a new (interim) coach and a mandate to eke whatever talent there is on this roster out onto the opponent following the Week 5 bye. The hope is it means bigger numbers (and perhaps more mistakes) from QB Ryan Tannehill, and Brandon Gdula of numberFire lists TE Jordan Cameron among his sleepers for the week :\nCameron is 19th among 28 tight ends with at least 15 targets in Reception NEP per target, but he’s 13th in Reception NEP. He’s third in Success Rate, so when he does catch it, things are going well. But he’s caught only 12 of 28 targets (42.86%).\nThis week, coming off a bye and with a new coach, Cameron gets the soft Titans.\nWhy Tennessee Could Win: Just as much as the hope might be Miami is shaken up for the good following the firing of Joe Philbin, Tennessee has the opportunity to twist the proverbial knife here. The Titans are at home and QB Marcus Mariota has been fantastic when facing teams that can’t rush the passer. Unless Miami sees a huge uptick following the bye and the coaching change, the Titans should be able to matriculate the ball down the field at ease.\nPrediction: Tennessee— It’s not going to be easy and it’s certainly not going to be pretty, but Tennessee gets the home win here and the Dolphins continue to search for answers.\nCarolina Panthers at Seattle Seahawks (4:05 p.m. ET)\nWhy Carolina Could Win: This game has become one of my favorite matchups over the past couple of years. Both teams are tough and physical defensively while leaning on a fantastic quarterback offensively. This year, Carolina has the clearcut advantage, and QB Cam Newton is a huge reason why.\nOn the other side of the ball, FanDuel’s Brandon Marianne Lee talked about how TE Jimmy Graham could continue having rough days against this Carolina defense:\nBefore you try defending Graham’s pass-catching abilities and consider plugging him in this week, just know the Panthers give up very few stats to opposing tight ends. Basically, this is a lose-lose situation for Seattle and a win-win for the Panthers.\nWhy Seattle Could Win: If Seattle wins, they’ll need to not only prove Brandon wrong about Graham, but in a big way. The defense shouldn’t have too difficult of a time defending the Panthers weapon-light offense, but the offense will struggle to gain traction. RB Marshawn Lynch is expected back, but no one has any idea whether that will actually happen or not. If he plays, RB Thomas Rawls will likely still get quite a bit of burn.\nPrediction: Carolina— Yes, Seattle is at home this weekend and yes, they’ve been playing better since S Kam Chancellor returned from his holdout, but the Seahawks are “0-fer” against the NFL’s top teams this season and the Panthers are clearly one of those great teams. The Panthers defensive front will win this one against the porous Seattle offensive line.\n© Mike Roemer/AP Green Bay Packers' James Jones celebrates a touchdown catch during the first half of an NFL football game against the Seattle Seahawks Sunday, Sept. 20, 2015, in Green Bay, Wis. San Diego Chargers at Green Bay Packers (4:25 p.m. ET)\nWhy San Diego Could Win: I’m trying hard, but I’m not coming up with much. The Chargers winning this game would be one of the biggest surprises of the year and would have to involve not only massive play from QB Philip Rivers and the rest of the offense, but an absolute herculean effort from the defense. Against a Packers team playing lights out on both sides of the ball, that seems about as remote as any underdog this week. For fantasy purposes, the hope in picking any Chargers has to lie with garbage-time points potentially pushing the final score.\nWhy Green Bay Could Win: San Diego is allowing over 26 points per game (23rd in the league), and it’s not insane to think the Packers could nearly double that in Week 6. Though QB Aaron Rodgers has an insane price, consider building your team around him, as he’s numberFire’s no. 2 QB on the week with a projected 20.53 points.\nPrediction: Green Bay— In a landslide.\nBaltimore Ravens at San Francisco 49ers (4:25 p.m. ET)\nWhy Baltimore Could Win: The upshot to 1-4 is the Ravens are obviously more talented than this. Yes, they’ve undergone some changes offensively and lost their best player (OLB Terrell Suggs) defensively, but there’s still a lot of potential here. I really like Baltimore’s passing attack to put up some numbers here, especially WR Kamar Aiken ($6000) who should continue to get plenty of attention whether Steve Smith (Questionable, Back) plays or not. To win, though, that defense needs to pick up more stops than it’s been getting.\nWhy San Francisco Could Win: Neither team is playing as good defensively as much as their fans hoped this season. While the 49ers have been one of the worst defenses against opposing running backs this season, they did have a good day in Week 1 against Adrian Peterson. Their hope here is they can produce something similar against the Ravens. Offensively, they just need QB Colin Kaepernick to take care of the football.\nPrediction: 49ers— Taking the home team in a game where it’s possible neither team really deserves to win.\n© Greg M. Cooper/USA TODAY Sports New England Patriots running back LeGarrette Blount (29) runs the ball against Indianapolis Colts defensive end Cory Redding (90) during the first quarter in the AFC Championship Game at Gillette Stadium. Sunday Night Football: New England Patriots at Indianapolis Colts (8:30 p.m. ET)\nWhy New England Could Win: QB Tom Brady ($9000) is numberFire’s top QB on the week with a projected 21.15 points, but it’s tough to go wrong with any of the Patriots’ offensive players in fantasy, and they’re numberFire’s no. 2 most efficient offense :\nThe Patriots have fielded the second-most efficient offense in the league, according to our metrics, leading to averages of 37.3 points per game (second behind only Arizona) and a league-leading 423.8 total yards per game.\nAnd with no one able to cover Rob Gronkowski (his 1.04 Reception NEP per target ranks him second among all tight ends with at least 20 targets), Julian Edelman fitting nicely into this team’s Wes Welker role, the emergence of surprise sensation Dion Lewis, and the team expecting to get Brandon LaFell back in Week 7, this team shows no signs of slowing down and should continue to roll as one of the league’s top offensive units for the rest of the season.\nRemember, the Patriots also have (statistically) one of the better defenses in the league, only giving up 19 points per game.\nWhy Indianapolis Could Win: The Colts are in pure survival mode at this point. If things don’t get better than their 3-2 start, they’ll be searching potentially for a new head coach and/or a new general manager this offseason. 3-2 may not sound terrible, but those three wins were gimme games against the rest of the AFC South, and they’ve dropped games to both the Bills and the Jets. They’re middle of the road defensively (expected), but below average offensively (what?!) and that needs to change with a hopefully healthy QB Andrew Luck ($8600, Questionable, Shoulder).\nPrediction: New England— After everything that’s gone on this offseason, this game’s been circled on Brady’s calendar. He’s not going to lose, no matter what the Colts cooked up with more time than usual to prepare.\nMonday Night Football: New York Giants at Philadelphia Eagles (8:30 p.m. ET)\nWhy New York Could Win: The Eagles are giving up some of the most fantasy points to wide receivers this season, and that’s great news for WR Odell Beckham Jr. (Questionable, Hamstring), who should continue to see a ton of targets if he’s anywhere close to 100 percent. If not, that matchup will fall on Reuben Randle who isn’t exactly a slouch. However, the onus is on the Giants’ offensive line to stop the Eagles’ front seven and allow QB Eli Manning to actually get his receivers the ball.\nWhy Philadelphia Could Win: The Eagles’ offensive explosion in Week 5 had much more to do with the Saints’ terrible defense, but their defense basically did what it’s been doing all season. Yes, they’re vulnerable against wide receivers as mentioned above, but a big piece of that was against Atlanta, and their defense overall has only been allowing 20.6 points per game, which is 11th-best in the league. I’m looking for them to continue to lean on that defense, even if their offense is much closer to 25 points than their 39 of last week.\nPrediction: Philadelphia— Both teams are striving for mediocrity this season, with the Eagles being a notch better defensively and the Giants a notch (or two) better offensively. I’ll take the defense (and the home team) here.\nTeams on Bye: Dallas, Oakland, St. Louis, Tampa Bay\nPicks Last Week: 9-5\nPicks on the Season: 49-28 (Tied for 42nd/136 at Pickwatch )\nThe post NFL Week 6 Picks: It’s Trapping Season and the NFL’s Elite Are Hunted This Week appeared first on FanDuel Insider .\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://www.fanduel.com/insider", "https://www.fanduel.com/insider/2015/10/15/nfl-week-6-picks-its-trapping-season-and-the-nfls-elite-are-hunted-this-week/", "https://www.numberfire.com/nfl/lists/6419/the-5-best-nfl-offenses-through-week-5/cincinnati-bengals-4", "https://www.numberfire.com/nfl/lists/6419/the-5-best-nfl-offenses-through-week-5/new-england-patriots-2", "https://www.fanduel.com/insider/2015/10/14/nfl-week-6-fantasy-class-analyzing-and-learning-from-the-hype/", "https://www.numberfire.com/nfl/lists/6421/10-fantasy-football-sleepers-for-week-6/jordan-cameron-te-miami-dolphins-10", "https://www.numberfire.com/nfl/lists/6419/the-5-best-nfl-offenses-through-week-5/arizona-cardinals-1", "https://www.fanduel.com/insider/2015/10/14/5-nfl-matchups-you-should-be-watching-during-week-6/"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:49:42.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
