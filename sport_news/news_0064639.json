It does us no good to help out for next week other than getting our kids ready to go…our whole focus and our whole season, obviously, depends on this next game.” \nThis matchup will likely have a similar look to the last as well, with a wrinkle or two thrown in. Last time around, the scoreboard didn’t look great for the Lakers. They lost 42-21, but the game was much closer than that. It came down to two drives; one on which the Lakers had a touchdown called back on account of a penalty and another where a tipped ball ended up going for a long Waynesville touchdown. If those plays go Camdenton’s way, then it’s a whole different ballgame, but that has been the Lakers’ season in a nutshell. Things haven’t bounced their way. \n“It gives us a little motivation coming into the game,” Shore said. “Even though we got beat by a fairly large margin in that game, that game had some potential to be a different story.” \nThe biggest key for Camdenton will be defending the pass and they struggled with that last week against Glendale. Glendale’s Alex Huston, the nation’s leading passer, torched the Lakers for 538 yards and nine touchdowns. Granted, Camdenton played well at times, but struggled to put together a full defensive drive that kept Glendale out of the end zone. The challenge will not be quite as steep against Waynesville, but the Lakers will need to improve defending the pass. \n“Obviously we have to keep the ball in front of us,” Shore said. “We didn’t anticipate (Waynesville) to throw as well as they did and they kinda caught us off-guard.” \nAfter facing a Glendale team who only throws the football, the Lakers are glad to go back to playing a team with a rushing attack. Camdenton played stellar run defense against Waynesville the last time around, holding the Tigers to just 21 yards on 27 carries. \nOffensively for the Lakers they will focus on running the football. They rushed for 161 yards against the Tigers in their last meeting, so they will look to build on that. While Jay Griffin has been their workhorse to this point in the season, coach Shore said the Carter Williams might be seeing more touches tonight. \n“I think that being a senior and being that he has a lot of experience I think that will be a situation where I look to see him carry the ball a little bit more than he has this season,” Shore said of Williams’ potential workload. “There’s something about that last game, being a senior, and the fact that if you don’t win it, you don’t play anymore. That’s a huge motivation factor. I’m hoping he can give us a spark there as well.” \nWhile they won’t be looking to throw the ball as much as they were forced to last week, the Lakers have some interesting options at quarterback. Isaiah Lumley came in for several drives, while Dyllan Decker shifted to wide receiver. The two played well together, as Decker caught eight passes for 89 yards and two touchdowns. While Decker is still the No. 1 quarterback, Shore likes having this wrinkle in his back pocket. \n“I’m not afraid to (put Lumley in),” Shore said. “There’s a lot of advantages to both those things, Dyllan has done some good things obviously and his arm strength is a huge factor on the deep ball. And then you bring in Isaiah and use Dyllan some at receiver, Dyllan’s obviously a weapon there too…it’s nice to have that little changeup.” \nWith all of the things that the Lakers have done well recently, particularly on the offensive end, penalties have slowed down their offense. They had numerous penalties, most notably illegal formations and offside calls. While Shore notes that using two different quarterbacks can confuse an offense at times, he is going to try some things in practice this week to try to cut down on those penalties. \n“We’ll have some immediate punishment,” Shore said of his techniques to cut down on penalties. “Whether it be sometimes go grab a tire or go tell another coach ‘hey I jumped offsides’ or some up-downs, ya know something that’s an immediate effect.” \nThe Lakers have had a rough season with only three wins, but the season begins again tonight and they are looking forward the opportunity. \nCamdenton at Waynesville - Listen live online: 935rocksthelake.com \nPodcast", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T10:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:38:23.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
