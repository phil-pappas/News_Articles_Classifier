The massive blaze that burned 257,000 acres remains the third largest wildfire in state history. File photo / Union Democrat. Tuolumne County and state officials are finalizing an application for about $100 million in post-Rim Fire projects through the National Disaster Resilience Competition, a $1 billion federal funding program for areas affected by major natural disasters between 2011 and 2013. A draft was released to the public Friday featuring proposed evacuation centers in Tuolumne and Groveland, a biomass and wood processing plant and various projects to improve forest and watershed health in the region. The final application is due to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development by Oct. 27. “It’s exciting, because this is something HUD is really going to be able to sink their teeth into,” said Seth Magden, project manager for GCR Inc., a consulting firm hired by the state to help prepare the application. Wildfires have burned more than 9 million acres across the United States to date in 2015, more than any other year since 2006, according to statistics from the National Interagency Fire Center. This summer also featured one of the most destructive wildfires in Mother Lode history, the Butte Fire, which destroyed nearly 500 homes and claimed two lives in Calaveras County. The state of California qualified for the National Disaster Resilience Competition, announced by President Barack Obama in June 2014, because of the 2013 Rim Fire. The massive blaze that burned 257,000 acres, mostly in the Stanislaus National Forest, remains the third largest wildfire in state history. Magden said the projects included in the state’s application could be replicated in other rural areas to reduce the risk for catastrophic wildfires like the Rim Fire. “This isn’t something HUD has done before in a rural county, and it serves other communities in the western United States,” he said. County and state officials have been working together on the application since the competition was announced in 2014. In June of this year, the state and 39 other municipalities throughout the U.S. were selected to move on to the final round. A call for potential projects earlier this summer drew 140 proposals, ranging from road improvements to fire trucks. The team working on the application reviewed the projects and found that a number of them were ineligible due to HUD guidelines, Deputy County Administrator Maureen Frank said. “We’re working with an organization that deals with urban interests,” she said. “Sometimes the things that are important to us as a rural community didn’t apply.” All of the information and cost estimates gathered on proposals that didn’t qualify for the competition could still be useful in the future, said Duke York, deputy director of the county roads division. “We’ll be prepared to pull that out when other funding opportunities become available,” he told the Tuolumne County Board of Supervisors at Tuesday’s meeting. “That information will not be lost.” Projects that qualified fall under three main categories, including: • $39 million for so-called “community resilience centers” in Tuolumne and Groveland; • $20 million for a biomass and wood processing facility; • $37 million for forest and watershed improvement projects, such as biomass removal, reforestation and strategic fire-fuel breaks. Magden said the community resilience centers could serve as places for people to evacuate to in the event of a disaster and be used year-round as community centers. “The stronger that a community is and the more close-knit they are, the better off they’ll be when a disaster does happen,” he said. The biomass and wood processing facility would create a place where the material generated from the proposed forest and watershed health projects could be re-used for the production of energy or wood products. “It creates additional job opportunities associated with the biomass removal and thinning,” he said. “There are direct and indirect employment opportunities associated with that facility.” Two public meetings are scheduled for next week in Tuolumne County where the public can review and comment on the proposed projects in the application. One meeting is scheduled for 4 p.m. Tuesday at the Groveland Community Center, 18720 Highway 120, Groveland. The other is set for 6 p.m. Wednesday at the County Administration Center, on the fourth floor at 2 S. Green St., Sonora.
