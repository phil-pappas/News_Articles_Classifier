The Agenda 2030 has also well recognised the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities in its implementation,” India’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Bhagwant Bishnoi said at a Third Committee meeting of the General Assembly yesterday.\nHe said the inter-linkages among the social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainable social development can only be addressed by strengthening of institutions and capacity at international, national, regional and local levels.\n“Efforts to fill the domestic financing gap in developing countries is only possible by international funding assistance led by the official development assistance by developed countries,” Bishnoi said, adding that with political resolve and selfless interest, the global community must transform itself into a resilient and sustainable society.\nBishnoi said given the uneven progress with regard to earlier development goals set by the UN, the international community cannot afford but to make poverty eradication and social inclusion our top priorities in order to achieve sustainable development.\nSocial integration with social inclusion is necessary to overcome inequalities both within and between countries, he said, adding that it is important to collectively stimulate growth and development through non-discriminatory employment generation policies and provide decent work for all.\nBishnoi highlighted that India’s policies and programmes in areas of poverty eradication, education, health and social protection have focused on the vulnerable sections, including women, children, disabled and older persons.\nHe outlined the policies undertaken by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government in the last year and a half and said they have been focussed on the principle of ‘Sab ka saath sab ka vikas’ (together with all, development for all).\nThe Prime Minister’s ‘Jan Dhan Yojana’ has provided banking access to 170 million people as a first step towards their economic empowerment and development, he said.\nNew Social protection schemes in the insurance sector have been launched, such as the Prime Minister’s ‘Suraksha Bima Yojana’ which benefitted over 100 million families within a span of 100 days of the launch. With the initiative of ‘Swachha Bharat’(clean India) by 2019, the government has prioritised water and sanitation for all.\nThe ‘Make in India’ and ‘Digital India’ campaigns aim at economic growth and bridging the digital divide and the recently launched ‘Skill India’ initiative aims at training nearly 400 million people by 2022, he said. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:12:08.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
