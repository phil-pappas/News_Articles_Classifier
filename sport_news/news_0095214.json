Aren't the two clubs too old for this? Ahenkorah questioned. \nTension has enveloped the two clubs over the past few days after the Appeals Committee of the Ghana Football Association upheld the appeal of the Porcupine Warriors aiding them to get their deducted six points back. \nAsante Kotoko appealed against the decision of the Disciplinary Committee which ruled that the Elite Clubs Competition matches were not official matches and therefore, Obed Owusu could not have served his suspension by sitting out in the Kotoko vs. Dunkwa United match. \nThe player was therefore adjudged to be unqualified when he featured for Kotoko against Hearts on the 2nd August 2015 after he had featured for Kotoko in three previous matches upon his 3rd caution. \nAs a result, Kotoko suffered a forfeiture of the said match by deduction of six points from their accumulated points and Hearts were awarded 3 goals and 3 points in accordance with article 34(2) of the General Regulations of the FA and a fine of GHÂ¢5,000.00 was also imposed on Kotoko. \nThe Phobians per the points deduction have moved from the 4th position and now occupy the 13th position on the league table though the 2014/15 First Capital Plus Premiership is over. \nFor more Ghana football news visit www.ghanasoccernet.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:36:20.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
