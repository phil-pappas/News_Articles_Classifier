Furthermore, Freedom was playing its first game without star junior quarterback Joe Young , who missed the game with a leg injury. \nAs fate would have it, Freedom came out sluggish in the first quarter, which is exactly what it couldn’t afford to do. \nParkland took advantage by surging to a 17-point lead and the Trojans went on to post a 38-7 Eastern Pennsylvania Conference victory at Orefield Middle School. \nParkland (7-1, 5-1) climbed into a first-place tie with Freedom (7-1, 5-1) in the EPC South Division. Easton and Liberty are one game off the pace. The Red Rovers hammered the Hurricanes 49-14 Friday night at BASD Stadium. \nFreedom’s woes started on its first offensive series. After a holding penalty, the Patriots faced fourth-and-19 from its 25. Punter Steven Rold couldn’t cleanly handle a low snap from center – which was a problem all night – and Parkland lineman Palmer Kerch broke through to block the punt. \nRELATED : Rapid recap: Parkland drops Freedom from unbeaten ranks \nThe play led to Donovan Berger’s 27-yard field goal. Devante Cross and Erik DiGirolamo ran for second quarter touchdowns to give the Trojans a comfortable 17-0 lead. \n“We made too many errors to beat a team as good as Parkland,” Freedom coach Jason Roeder said. “Give credit to them. They forced us into some of those mistakes. They’re a good football team and they deserved to win.” \nIn Freedom’s defense, playing without Young essentially left the team without starters at two positions. Jonah Gundrum , arguably the team’s best wide receiver, took over for Young at quarterback. \nAce running back Roberto Diez was injured several weeks ago and may miss the rest of the season, although Andres Santos has done a stellar job as his replacement. \nDespite the adversity, Roeder predictably offered no alibis. \n“We haven’t made excuses for 11 years,” Roeder said. “We sure as heck aren’t going to start now.” \nThe Patriots had trouble sustaining drives and their only points came with 3:22 left in the second quarter when Alec Huertas took an end around and tossed a 67-yard touchdown pass to a wide open Brennan Reinert . \nOtherwise, the Patriots were kept of the board by a stout Parkland defense. \n“Listen,” Roeder said, “No one wants to admit it, but they beat us in all three phases of the game. We needed to play our best football game and obviously we didn’t do that.” \nRoeder turned the page and placed his emphasis on next week’s game against Easton at BASD Stadium. \n“We’ve got to bounce back and focus on Easton,” Roeder said. “We told the kids that this (Parkland) was our biggest game of the year. Well, guess what, next week’s game is even bigger. We have to prepare to play our best game.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:20:46.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
