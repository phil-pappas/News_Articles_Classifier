Many rock gyms have classes for kids as young as four, and it's a super way to spend time as a family. Sign everyone up for a seminar or training course and get started with the right technique and knowledge of safety basics. \nIndividual Achievement \nRock climbing offers kids amazing opportunities for individual achievement, and it's exciting to master new maneuvers and improve on speed, agility and fundamental climbing moves. It's a great way for kids to challenge themselves and overcome fears in a safe, supervised environment. For youngsters who aren't interested in team sports, rock climbing offers a more individual athletic pursuit that can also be done as a group. Because climbing often involves a climber and a belayer, it's also a social sport. \nMental and Physical Skills \nHanging onto tiny toe holds and moving upward quickly develops strength and agility. Rock climbing isn't just a physical challenge; it also requires a lot of mental exercise, planning and anticipating each move to get to the top. It's good to look up and scope out a route ahead of time so you can get in position to make the right moves. \nSafety Checks \nAlways climb safely and be sure your kids know the basic safety and courtesy rules at the rock gym. Climbers should always make sure knots are tied properly, their harness is buckled and double-backed and the rope is securely strung through the connection points of the harness. The belayer needs to make sure the harness is buckled and double-backed, the carabiner is locked and the rope is exiting the belay device tail-side down. \nLook Out Below \nWhen you take your kids climbing, it can be helpful to do a bit of coaching from below. You can suggest where to put hands or feet next, unless you youngster prefers to do it all on his own. It's also a good idea to tell your kids to give you a heads-up if they're starting to fall by calling out \"falling\" as a warning to the belayer. \nPowers of Observation \nRock gyms are full of all levels of climber, and a great way for kids to improve their own technique is by watching others and making mental notes. By observing and practicing new climbing techniques, youngsters develop the muscle memory that pushes skills to a new level. Also, the more you climb, the better your balance, speed and forearm strength become. \nSaving Strength \nGenerally, the legs are stronger than the arms, so conserving forearm strength is important in climbing. Climbers should try to keep weight carried mostly by the legs, using arms for balance and shifting weight. Moves requiring a lot of upper body movement should be accomplished as quickly as possible to conserve arm strength. \nBasic Gear \nWhen your kids first start rock climbing, rent equipment at the gym for the first few times to make sure they're interested to warrant investing in gear of their own. Basic equipment consists of a climbing harness, a rocking carabiner to attach a belay device to the harness, and chalk to keep fingers and palms dry to minimize slipping. Like all climbers, kids should rent shoes for a while until they get to know they type of shoe that suits their climbing style. \nFrom birthday parties to family outings and an afternoon with pals at the rock gym, this amazing sport is ideal for kids of all ages and a great way to keep the kids active and off the couch this winter! Join them and you just might find yourself addicted to this growing fitness trend. \nLet your kids enjoy the rock climbing experience at Maplewood Summer Day Camp.
