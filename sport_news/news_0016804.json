She seems to be in constant dialogue with people who have unflinching faith in her ability to do enormous good to the mankind, and, on the other hand, with Gods of heaven where she belongs. Legendary American poet Robert Frost in his poem “West Running Brook” has captured the mood when he says, “Look, look. It’s waving to us with a wave, To let us know it hears me”. It is like super consciousness interacting and overpowering souls of people made pure by the Ganga. She by virtue of her heavenly powers not only purifies people but also establishes a connect between them and the heaven. “Ever since rivers, I was going to say, were born in heaven”. —Robert Frost The Ganga is a river of a civilization that has nurtured dreams of mighty emperors. It continues to be a river of spiritualism that assures salvation. The Ganga known as the Bhagirathi uptil Dev Prayag is a river of organic culture that has created a rainbow of art, religion and philosophy. All rivers are revered in India but the Ganga’s place is of a divine Goddess among the Indian people that promises purification. The Bhagirathi rises from the Gangotri glacier and joins the Kedar Ganga at Gangotri. At Bhaironghati, the Jad Ganga that comes from Tibet passing through the beautiful Nelong valley, meets the Bhagirathi at Bhaironghati near Lanka Bridge. From here, the Bhagirathi picks up the pace as the flood plain is narrow and the gorges are deep until she reaches Dharali and from there she meanders slowly towards Harsil as if she is enjoying the beauty of the orchards of the famous Harsil apples. The Kachora Gad or a rivulet from Himachal meets the Bhagirathi near Harsil. The floods of 1978 and the river water getting clogged near Dabrani created a vast plain field at Harsil, slowing her pace, but she again picks up the speed meets the Asi Ganga at Gangori. From here, she ferociously moves on her downhill journey till Maneri where the man-made hydropower project curtails her flow to some extent. After a small hiccup, it continues her journey towards Uttarkashi, which is the biggest religious centre after Gangotri. The journey of the Bhagirathi downhill till Uttarkashi encompasses all moods of the nine Goddesses worshipped during the Navratras. The brilliantly refulgent waters of great promise and boon flow from Gaumukh in the Garhwal Himalayas, striding deep valleys surrounded by towering mountain peaks to bestow peace, prosperity and salvation to mortal human beings. The greatness of the Bhagirathi is sung in numerous holy books by seers of pure souls. In Mahabharata, Anusasana Parva, (Chapter 27, Verse 26), Yudhishthira asks Bhisma: Which countries, which provinces, which retreats, which mountains, and which rivers, O grandsire, are the foremost in point of sanctity? Bhishma cites an old narrative in which a Brahmana asks a Rishi crowned with ascetic success the same quesion. The Rishi says: Those countries, those provinces, those retreats, and those mountains, should be regarded as the foremost in point of sanctity through which or by the side of which that foremost of all rivers, viz., the Bhagirathi (Ganga) flows. That end which a creature is capable of attaining by penances, by Brahmacharya (practising celibacy), by sacrifice, or by practising renunciation, one is sure to attain by only living by the side of the Bhagirathi and bathing in her sacred waters. Those men who use Bhagirathi waters in all their acts, surely ascend to heaven after departing from this world. Even those men who, having committed diverse kinds of sinful deeds in the first part of their lives, betake themselves in after years to a residing by the side of the Ganga, succeed in attaining to a very superior end. However, The Ganga today herself is sinned against. The increasing level of environmental degradation that has led to widespread devastation all along her banks in the region and pollution caused by people, numerous ashrams and hotels is a cause for worry. The Uttarakhand Environment Conservation and Pollution Control Board (UECPCB) says that the level of pollution in the river has reached alarming proportions. If the present trend continues, the Ganga water will become unusable even for agricultural purposes. According to an UECPCB study, the level of coliform present in water should be below 50 for drinking purposes, less than 500 for bathing and below 5,000 for agricultural use. The present level of coliform in the Bhagirathi at Uttarkashi is nearing the alarming level.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:11:14.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
