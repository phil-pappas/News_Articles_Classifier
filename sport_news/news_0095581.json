Special photo by Anthony Stalcup slideshow Week 10 was an important one for terms of playoff seeding, but Cherokee County’s teams could not rise to the occasion.The county’s teams went 0-4 on Friday, with Sequoyah and Woodstock getting eliminated from playoff contention, Cherokee digging itself into a deep hole and River Ridge failing again to find its first win.While Cherokee (4-4, 2-4 Region 5 ) did not eliminate itself after blowing a 15-point lead to Lassiter, it will need to have a lot go its way. A third straight loss dropped the Warriors from fourth in the region to a three-way tie for fifth, one game behind Wheeler and alongside Lassiter and Milton — both of which hold tiebreakers over Cherokee.Cherokee will need Wheeler, Lassiter and Milton to slip up down the stretch, and it needs to handle its own business, which will not be easy with region leaders Roswell and Walton remaining on the schedule.Roswell showed how tough that game will be when it traveled to Woodstock and won 69-7 on Friday, eliminating the Wolverines (4-5, 2-5) from playoff contention.Woodstock’s offense moved the ball at times against the Hornets, but four turnovers and five sacks proved to be too much for the Wolverines to overcome. Still, for a team with just 16 seniors, coach Brent Budde is happy with the way the team progressed and sees a bright future.“We still have a lot to play for,” Budde said. “We have one more chance to suit up as a member of the 2015 Woodstock Wolverines. That team will never exist again. We had a lot of young players, and we got better, but the schedule got tougher. It’s still all about getting better.”There is some good news for the county. With the way everything played out this week, idle Etowah (7-1, 5-1) locked up a playoff spot and can finish no worse than fourth in the region.In Region 7 (A), Sequoyah (2-6, 2-3) had an opportunity to take control of the subregion’s final opportunity at playing for a state playoff berth with a win over Rome, but the Chiefs came up short.They played well in the first half and led 7-0 at the break, but a 28-point third-quarter outburst from Rome was too much for Sequoyah to overcome. Now, Rome will be left to play Cass next week to decide which team will get into a play-in game.“The loss doesn’t change anything about what we’re doing,” Sequoyah coach James Teter said. “We’re still going to prepare, work hard and try to get another win. You want to win for your seniors and send them out on the right note. They’ve been a great class. You also want to build some momentum going into next season.”River Ridge also struggled after a decent start in its 33-12 loss to Cass.The Knights (0-8, 0-5) were driving in the first half down 14-6, but a fumble was returned for a touchdown and a snap went too high for a safety. They never recovered and will have to continue their search for a win next week against Creekview, which has already clinched the subregion’s second seed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:15:19.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
