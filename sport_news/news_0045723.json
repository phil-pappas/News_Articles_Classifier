Maybe it was the extra time spent with family the last six weeks.\nDolphins head coach Chris Scott, simply put, was glad to be back on the sidelines guiding his defending Group 6A state-champion Dolphins.\nHis players were happy to have him and showed it in a 52-6 victory over a Kellam team that had been playing its best football of the season.\nThe Dolphins (6-0) are riding a 21-game winning streak.\n\"It's good to be back concentrating on making (the players) be the best they can be, because it's all about them,\" Scott said as he made his way to the end zone for his first post-game address of the season. \"It really feels good to get one in and get back with the guys.\"\nHis guys had been more than holding their own, going 5-0 without threat.\nOcean Lakes wasted little time in rolling up more numbers, scoring on five of their seven first-half possessions.\nLed by South Hampton Roads leading running back Khalan Laborn, the Dolphins charged to a 35-0 lead.\nLaborn, who came in with 825 yards, scored three first-half touchdowns - finishing the game with 151 yards and four TDs on 19 carries.\n\"It was a great feeling having our general back,\" Laborn said. \"Everything is on point now. We've missed him, I've missed him and all his passion on the sidelines.\n\"Just hearing his voice made things feel so much better.\"\nBy halftime the Dolphins had racked up 339 total yards of offense while holding Kellam (2-4) to just 71 - most of which came on a late second-quarter scoring drive that ended up with Tyree Thorpe catching a 36-yard pass from Justin Glasier for the Knights' only points of the game. Thorpe was the lone highlight for Kellam, catching four passes for 61 of Glasier's 76 yards. Glasier was intercepted twice by Ocean Lakes.\n\"We could have done some things better on defense,\" Laborn said. \"We still have things to work on.\"\nOcean Lakes' alternating quarterbacks - Kody Cunningham (6-9-0 for 71 yards) and Tyler DeSue (4-6-0 for 122 yards and two touchdowns) -kept the flow of the game consistent while the Dolphins ran six different running backs. Jake Low took over most of the mop-up duties and still finished with 89 yards and a touchdown on seven carries.\nJermaine Trotman caught DeSue's two touchdown passes and finished with 104 yards receiving on four catches.\nLee Tolliver, 757-222-5844,\nlee.tolliver@pilotonline.com\nTwitter at @LeeTolliver\n Beach District High Schools Sports Virginia Beach", "external_links": ["http://hamptonroads.com/2015/10/ocean-lakes-wins-big-scotts-return-dolphins", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://hamptonroads.com/2014/04/rankings-top-10-boys-soccer", "http://hamptonroads.com/2014/04/rankings-top-10-girls-soccer", "http://hamptonroads.com/2015/03/rankings-top-10-high-school-baseball", "http://hamptonroads.com/blogs/jami-frankenberry", "http://media.hamptonroads.com/cache/files/images/775031000.jpg", "http://hamptonroads.com/2014/04/rankings-top-10-high-school-softball", "http://hamptonroads.com/blogs/larry-rubama", "https://twitter.com/757teamz", "http://hamptonroads.com/pilot/sports/high-schools", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?app_id=191370510928567&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F757teamz&send=false&layout=button_count&width=120&show_faces=true&action=like&colorscheme=light&font&height=28", "http://hamptonroads.com/2015/07/2015-public-schools-football-schedules"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:05:03.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
