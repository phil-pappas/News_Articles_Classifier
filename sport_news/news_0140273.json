It said the fire had been put out and the injuries were from burns.\nThe injured men were hospitalized at the nearby town of Cacak.\nSerbia has a poor factory safety record, with several explosions and accidents at weapons and munitions plants in recent years, some of them deadly. Only a day earlier, fire on another machine injured two other workers at the same factory in Lucani, Serbian media reported.\nThe ministry says it has opened an investigation into the fire.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
