And while both sides said during Thursday’s workouts that previous rancor has been forgotten, the emotionally charged atmosphere of playoff baseball means there could be some short fuses in the opener tonight.\n\"It’s over with. We’ve got to move forward,\" insisted the Royals’ Edinson Volquez, who will start Game 1 and was arguably the biggest instigator when the teams met in August.\nIt was Volquez whose inside pitching drew the ire of the Blue Jays, eventually leading to the first of those bench-clearing moments. And after the game, he called Blue Jays star Josh Donaldson \"a little baby\" for complaining about his inside pitching.\nAsked whether he intends to pitch inside again tonight, Volquez replied: \"Of course.\"\nRoyals manager Ned Yost was one word more succinct: \"Absolutely.\"\nEven if it might mean more bad blood.\n\"I’m not a mind reader. I’m not a fortune teller. I don’t know if it’s going to be an issue,\" Yost said. \"But we’ll pitch inside aggressively. That’s a power-laden club over there. We’re going to formulate a really good game plan and try to go out and execute.\"\nThe Blue Jays, who start Marco Estrada in the opener, won three straight elimination games against Texas to reach their first AL Championship Series since 1993. The last of those games Wednesday was as tense as they come.\nAfter the Rangers took the lead on a fluke play, the Blue Jays stormed back thanks in part to three Texas errors. Donaldson’s blooper tied the game, and Jose Bautista capped the comeback with a long three-run homer, emphatically flipping his bat nearly as high in the air.\nBautista’s reaction wasn’t taken well by the Rangers, who essentially called it bush league, and the entire affair touched off a wide-spread debate about decorum.\n\"You look at all professional sports in general, everybody celebrates more so than they used to,\" Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. \"In our particular sport, if it’s happening for your team, your guy gets a big hit, nobody minds it. If you’re on the other side, nobody likes it.\"\nThat’s why there could be some testy moments when the teams begin their best-of-seven showdown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:48:04.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
