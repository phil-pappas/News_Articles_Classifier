The figures released by police go back to January 2013 and end in August 2015.\nWhile the crime figures rose after oil prices began to plummet in the fall of 2014, it appears to be a seasonal trend where crime is worse in the summer. The data shows incidents of crime also rose in the summer months of 2014 as well as 2013, a period when the police data says oil was closer to $100 a barrel.\nThe difference is that crime did not drop off as nearly as much in the winter of 2015 as it did in 2014, according to the data, and rose higher in summer 2015.\nEdmonton Mayor Don Iveson said the downturn in the economy means Edmonton ends up policing “northern Alberta’s problem children.”\nKnecht said he would be asking Edmonton’s city council for 80 more officers.\nBlake said last week that she would welcome an apology from Knecht and Iveson, saying it seemed like her community was “an easy target.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:28:27.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
