He took his record to 21-1 with eight knockouts, his only defeat coming in his fifth pro bout in 2009. \n\nSelby is particularly interested in a future fight against Leon Santa Cruz. \n\nHe was ringside when Santa Cruz, a former bantamweight and junior featherweight title holder won a majority decision and vacant world title against Abner Mares on August 29. \n\nFirst he'll have to get past the 36-year-old Montiel, whose record of 54-4-2 with 39 knockouts includes eight victories in a row at junior feather and featherweight. \n\n\"I honestly believe that he chose the wrong guy to fight,\" said Montiel, who expects strong support at the Gila River Arena in suburban Glendale. \n\n\"I've won in hostile crowds before, so it won't be a problem,\" said Selby, adding that he's looking forward to a tough test. \n\n\"I'm really excited,\" he said. \"This is my first world title defence and it's against a tough challenge that most guys wouldn't take. It's not an easy win. \n\n\"If I beat a guy like him and look good, it should raise my profile overnight.\" \n\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:42:09.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
