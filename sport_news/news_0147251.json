Joe's a competitor. He loves to compete, and if he couldn't go, he couldn't go. It has to be something that's going to limit his ability to play at the level he's used to playing at, so I'm not worried about Joe at all.\" \nKruger said he was \"a little bit\" upset with the fact that people would criticize Haden, who instead of testing the free-agent market, elected to sign a five-year extension prior to the start of the 2014 regular season with a team that has not yet had a winning record in any of the years he has been with the club. \n\"Playing in an NFL game is a different kind of beast,\" Kruger said. \"It becomes natural for us because we're doing it so much, but if you really think about what you're putting your body through, how taxing it is, both mentally and physically, you'll eventually appreciate what guys like Joe have been doing for a long time.\" \nAfter making the decision not to play against the Chargers, Haden felt the need to go around the locker room in San Diego to personally address the leaders of the defense and tell them he was not going to play because of injury. \nIn doing so, Haden gained a measure of support from his teammates. \n\"It feels good because I'm in here with these guys,\" Haden said. \"They know my heart. They know how passionate I am about playing, how much I want the Browns to turn it around and start winning. I want to be here. I signed my extension to play here and be here when it gets good. \n\"My whole thing is, me going out there, it hurt me because that's not the case at all. I want to be out there, I want to play for my teammates and all those guys. I know they have my back. Even when I found out the decision, walking up to them individually, letting them know, 'Man, look. Ya'll know I got your back. I can't go out there and help ya'll today because I'm not going to be able to help you. I'm going to hurt the team.' Just them knowing that when I look at each one of their eyes, letting them know, 'Dude, my bad. I'm going to do everything I can to get back out there with you.' \n\"They knew if I told them that I couldn't go, then I couldn't go. They knew it wasn't a playing hurt thing. It was a, 'Joe, you're injured. I understand if you can go, you'll be out there,' and that's the thing. With 'Los, with Paul Kruger, with Des (Bryant), with those guys, I would never question them. I know these guys. We're in here. We're grinding. We've gone to training camp together. We're fighting, battling together, so I understand. A paycheck is a paycheck, whatever. If you can't play and you're a player that we depend on, then we know that it's just because you can't. You'll hurt the team instead of helping them.\" \nWith the questions about his desire to play now behind him, Haden wants to focus on getting back to work and helping the Browns win games, especially on Sunday against the Baltimore Ravens, whom Cleveland has beaten just once since the 2007 season. \n\"The fans that know me, that are passionate about the Cleveland Browns, they know that I'm here for one reason,\" Haden said. \"I'm here to make the team better and to win, and that's my only objective. And on the inside, with the locker room, my teammates, they know and they don't treat me (any) other way. They're like, 'Joe, man, do what you've got to do,' because they know where my heart is and they know I want us to win badder than anybody in this building. \n\"As long as I've got them on my side, as long as I've got my coaches riding with me, the true fans that know that I'm here to help the Browns, I'm here to help us win. Any means necessary, I'm going to do what we've got to do. That's why it hurt a little bit, but at the end of the day, the people that matter, that know what's going on, they understand what's going on.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1Rvgeun TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:26:39.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
