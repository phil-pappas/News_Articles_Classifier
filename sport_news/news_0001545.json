(AP) - Federal prosecutors say two mail carriers have been charged with taking bribes in exchange for helping a western New York drug ring.\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office says a 56-year-old man from Derby and a 25-year-old woman from Cheektowaga face multiple counts of bribery in connection with their involvement with marijuana trafficking.\nProsecutors say the man has been employed by the U.S. Postal Service for 16 years while the woman had been a mail carrier for two years.\nOfficials say the two provided people's addresses in Buffalo to a person posting as a drug dealer so that marijuana could be mailed in boxes sent from the West Coast.\nThe addresses were on each carrier's mail delivery route. When the boxes arrived in Buffalo, prosecutors say the suspects handed them over to their drug connection in exchange for cash.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:31:00.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
