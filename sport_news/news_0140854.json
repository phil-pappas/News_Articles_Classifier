Rhoads wouldn't say whether Mangino quit or was fired. \nThe move Monday came on the same day Iowa State promoted sophomore Joel Lanning to a starting role over senior Sam Richardson, but Rhoads says Lanning's promotion was not the reason Mangino left. \nRhoads announced that passing game coordinator Todd Sturdy will take over for Mangino, starting with Saturday's game against Texas (3-4, 2-2 Big 12). \nMangino was 50-48 in eight seasons as the coach at Kansas. He joined Rhoads' staff prior to last season. \nIowa State (2-5, 1-3) is averaging 26.9 points per game. \nAP College Football website: collegefootball.ap.org \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T19:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:19:49.595+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
