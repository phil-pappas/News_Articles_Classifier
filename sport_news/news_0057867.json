The first came on the team's first series, when Fitzpatrick threw to Brandon Marshall for 58 yards on the first play and Chris Ivory ran it in two plays later from the 3.\nNick Folk converted both extra points and added a pair of field goals.\nThe Dolphins got their only score with a little help from New York's secondary.\nMiami quarterback Ryan Tannehill threw deep to Jarvis Landry in the second quarter, and Darrelle Revis was called for pass interference, giving the Dolphins 36 yards.\nOn the next play, Tannehill threw to Jordan Cameron, but Marcus Gilchrist was whistled for another pass interference. That gave Miami another 22 yards.\nTannehill found Jake Stoneburner on the next play for 8 yards and a touchdown to make the score 13-7 midway through the second quarter.\n- Chris Lehourites reporting from London\n___\n10:20 a.m.\nDolphins starting cornerback Brent Grimes has left the game in the first quarter Sunday in London with a right knee injury. He is questionable to return.\nGrimes came up limping after whiffing on an attempted tackle of Jets wide receiver Brandon Marshall, who scampered for 22 yards on the third-down play. Earlier, Grimes gave up a 58-yard yard completion to Marshall on the Jets' first play on offense.\nGrimes tried to run on the knee with trainers on the sideline, grimacing in pain. He stayed on the sideline with his helmet off.\nThe Dolphins defense soon took another loss as starting outside linebacker Jelani Jenkins was taken out with stinger symptoms after a hit to one of his shoulders. He was listed as questionable to return.\n- Shawn Pogatchnik reporting from London\n___\n10:10 a.m.\nNew York Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick racked up 100 yards passing pretty quickly, needing only four throws in less than 10 minutes of play.\nFitzpatrick threw deep to Brandon Marshall on New York's first play from scrimmage, connecting for a 58-yard gain. The Jets quickly took a 7-0 lead two plays later.\nOn the second possession, Fitzpatrick threw to Marshall for nine more yards, and then another for 22. The Jets quarterback went over the 100 mark when he threw to Bilal Powell for 12 yards, making him 4-for-4 for 101 yards. Marshall had 89 of those yards.\nThe Jets settled for a field goal to take a 10-0 lead.\n- Chris Lehourites reporting from London\n___\n9:45 a.m.\nThe Dolphins brought out the big guns for the coin toss.\nMiami quarterback greats Bob Griese and Dan Marino were the honorary captains for the game against the New York Jets on Sunday at Wembley Stadium. They didn't help, though.\nThe Jets won the toss and decided to kick off to start the 12th regular-season NFL game at Wembley Stadium, the home England's national soccer team and recent host venue of two Rugby World Cup matches.\nFor the Jets, Curtis Martin and Wayne Chrebet were honorary captains.\n- Chris Lehourites reporting from London\n___\n9:30 a.m.\nLondon has hosted 11 previous NFL games since 2007, but a matchup Sunday between the AFC East's New York Jets and Miami Dolphins is the first game involving divisional foes to be held on British soil. So the atmosphere in Wembley Stadium featured a heightened sense of rivalry.\nThe boo birds rang out loudly when the Jets took the field for pregame warmups as the crowd - many donning the aqua blue jerseys of the Dolphins - sought to get behind the official \"home\" team. Londoners young and old wore the jerseys of their favorites, with Ryan Tannehill and Dan Marino often appearing side by side in the stands.\nMiami also appeared to bring South Beach weather with them as fans in the north stand bathed in unseasonal, almost blinding sunshine. Visiting Americans could be overheard joking that they'd take a fine tan home with them.\n- Shawn Pogatchnik reporting from London\n___\nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
