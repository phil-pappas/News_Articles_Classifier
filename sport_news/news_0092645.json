(AP) - New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan is asking the federal government to allocate resources for long-term monitoring and testing for those who were exposed to chemicals from a contaminated well in Portsmouth.\nHassan sent a letter Monday to President Barack Obama.\nTest results show that children exposed to water from the Haven well at the Pease International Tradeport have higher levels of a chemical in their blood than children who weren't exposed.\nThe well was closed in May 2014 after contaminants were discovered at levels 10 times higher than the Environmental Protection Agency's acceptable levels.\nHassan also asked for resources to continue the Air Force's efforts on the remediation of the Pease aquifer and all of the contaminated wells as quickly as possible in order to ensure water quality is restored.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
