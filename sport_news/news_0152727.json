I’m in the movie, what are you going to do about it? You either enjoy it or you don’t. \n“I’m not saying get used to the future, but what is already happening. People of colour and women are increasingly being shown on-screen. For things to be whitewashed just doesn’t make sense.” \nJohn revealed how time stood still when he heard the news he had landed a role in the highly-anticipated seventh instalment of George Lucas’s sci-fi franchise, which is being directed by JJ Abrams. \n“I learned that I got the part over a nice breakfast in Mayfair. JJ said, ‘John, you’re the new star of Star Wars’, and everything froze for a moment,” he recalled. John Boyega and JJ Abrams (Richard Shotwell/Invision) \nThe actor said his performance in Attack The Block sparked JJ’s interest in him. \n“There was already contact between me and JJ. He was a big fan of Attack The Block and we were waiting for a project where we could collaborate.” \nMeeting co-star Harrison Ford, who reprises his role as Han Solo in the upcoming movie, was an eye-opening experience. \nJohn said: “He has that knowledge and it’s beautiful to watch… He told me about his career and his house. I realised that I probably couldn’t relate to him about finances because he’s on another level.” \nAnd as he prepares to hit the big time, once Star Wars: The Force Awakens opens in UK cinemas on December 17, the Peckham-born actor has already picked up tips from more experienced people in the business. \n“I’m being mentored by Robert Downey Jr at the moment,” he said. \n“He’s helped me prepare for how my life is going to change and that has been inspiring. I’m talking to someone who understands the power of choices, both positive and negative.” Reblog", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:50:15.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
