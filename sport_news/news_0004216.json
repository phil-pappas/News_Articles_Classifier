It starts with a frame of introduction to the kingdom of Sonam Kapoor's estate.\nThe Rajashri Production trade stamp is visible from the get go. Shreya Ghoshal's sweet voice croons the title song and as the grandeur of the setting engulfs you, you hear Salman announcing the return of the much beloved 'Original' Prem!\nYes, Salman Khan's Prem is back!\nThe Rajasthani look of shervanis and jewels dazzles you and yes, there is plenty of drama as you see Prem utter one of the sanskari dialogues, Har family me problem hain , par wo khush nasib hain , jinki family hoti hai . (Every family has issues, but lucky are those who have one.)\nBut wait, there is not just melodrama and sweetness galore, there is a promise of action scenes with a buggy and a glimpse of the not-so-good version of Salman.\nSalman Khan is paired with Sonam Kapoor for the first time. Sonam plays Maithili - an Indian princess and Salman Khan will play a double role in the movie.\nPresented by Fox Star Studios, Prem Ratan Dhan Payo is produced by Rajshri Productions.\nThe film which also stars Neil Nitin Mukesh, Armaan Kohli, Swara Bhaskar and Anupam Kher, is set to release on November 12, 2015.\nWatch:", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vd4iNPuRlx4"], "published": "2015-10-01T12:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:34:49.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
