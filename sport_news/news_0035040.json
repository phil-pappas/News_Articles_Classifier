He forced a fumble of Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson as he was going into the end zone late in Monday's 13-10 win that saved the victory for Seattle. \n\"He gives them a guy who’s been back there since Pete (Carroll) took over,\" said Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis. \"They understand the ins and outs of things. When you play with a new player, who has been there through camp and two weeks of the season, you’re not sure when certain things come up. You’re also not sure what he doesn’t know, so the confidence of that group and the continuity of playing together is raised when you put a guy like Kam back in there, who plays both passing lanes and up to the line of scrimmage. He does a lot of things.\" \nThe 6-foot-3, 232-pound Chancellor was selected in the fifth round of the 2010 draft out of Virginia Tech and was selected to the NFC Pro Bowl team in 2011, 2013 and 2014. \n\"Kam is a guy who seems like a big part of that defense,\" said Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton, who is trying to become the first quarterback since the new passer rating system was established in 1973 to begin a season with a rating of 115.0 or higher in the first five games. \"He made the big play that helped them win the game (last week). That's what he does for that defense. He's got energy, he's got passion -- you see it in the way he plays. That's what they need in their defense, and that's what they thrive on.\" \nIn the 20 possessions the Bears and Lions had over the last two games, the Seattle defense forced a three-and-out nine times. \n\"He's the quarterback of the defense for us,\" said Seahawks coach Pete Carroll. \"He's really the centerpiece, and has been for a number of years. This has been a good group - they'd played together and played well throughout the years, but they really counted on one another and Kam is a big factor. It's obvious when you look at the last couple of weeks, we're much better than we were the first two, so I think that's a statement in itself.\" \nKam Chancellor (31) Photo: AP Photo/Scott Eklund \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
