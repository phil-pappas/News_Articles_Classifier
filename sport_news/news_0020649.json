Two nights after Chase Utley’s takeout slide broke the leg of Ruben Tejada, the New York Mets and Los Angeles Dodgers appeared to put their grievances aside and just play baseball.\nThat proved a winning formula for the suddenly hot-hitting Mets in Citi Field’s first postseason game Monday. A 13-7 rout of the Dodgers in front of an electric, sold out, orange-rally towel waving crowd left the Mets a win away from moving on to the National League Championship Series.\nTheir first chance to advance to play the Chicago Cubs or St. Louis Cardinals comes Tuesday night, when rookie lefthander Steven Matz will take the mound for Game 4. The Dodgers’ hopes to even the series at two games apiece rest with Clayton Kershaw, the reigning National League MVP and three-time Cy Young Award winner with the 4.99 career postseason ERA.\n\"We came into this knowing we were going to see him twice and possibly (Zack) Greinke twice. That's a tall order for anybody, any team,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said. \"But it is what it is, so if we can get our guys home so they can get some decent sleep, they'll come back ready for (Tuesday).\nMore coverage VOTE: Was Chase Utley’s takeout slide dirty?

I don't know how long a leash he's going to have, but we gotta make him work as we did the other day in Los Angeles. That's the only way -- when you face him, you better hunt a pitch and you better hit it. If he's on, he's real tough.\"\nAs far as Mets aces go, Matt Harvey was far from his sharpest Monday. It hardly mattered. Curtis Granderson set the tone in the second inning with a three-run double. Travis d’Arnaud broke out of his slump with three hits and three runs batted in, two on a third-inning home run. And Yoenis Cespedes one-upped him with a mammoth three-run homer in the fourth and the rout was on.\nCollins pulled Harvey after only five innings in which the polarizing star exhausted 97 pitches. Harvey’s offense bailed him out with a four-run bottom of the second inning after he surrendered three runs in the top half of the frame. Given his lesser-than-expected workload, he could be available out of the bullpen in Game 5 if the Dodgers force one.\nUtley, greeted by Mets fans with boisterous boos during pregame introductions and derogatory chants in the early innings, did not appear in the game and afterward through a Dodgers spokesman declined to speak to reporters. Jimmy Rollins started and went 1 for 5 with a ninth-inning single. The Dodgers, trailing from the second inning on, mounted little meaningful offense after stringing together four consecutive singles in their three-run second.\n\"I think the boos at the introductions were kind of a big statement leading into the game and we knew the biggest thing going in was coming on top and scoring as many runs as we did, and you know, that kind of did all the talking,\" Harvey said. \"So for us it was stay focused, go out and let our play do all the talking and all that stuff will be resolved later.\"\nThe game's lopsided result illustrated the drop-off in the Dodgers’ rotation after the incredible 1-2 punch of Kershaw and Greinke. The Mets chased Brett Anderson, Los Angeles’ sinkerballing lefthander, after three innings. They tagged him with six runs on seven hits. His third-to-last pitch was a change-up that d’Arnaud launched over the left-field fence.\nAlex Wood, another lefthanded starter, pitched in relief of Anderson but did not fare any better. He was on the mound for New York’s four-run fourth, a frame punctuated by the second-deck shot by Cespedes, the first Mets player with three hits, three runs and three RBIs in a postseason game. D’Arnaud became the second to accomplish that feat three innings later.\nNew York’s 13 runs set a franchise record for a postseason game. After two days in which a controversial slide dominated the chatter surrounding this National League division series, the Mets’ bats turned the attention back to the play on the field.\nTo advance, they must beat either Kershaw on Tuesday or Greinke in Game 5 on Thursday back in Los Angeles.\nA daunting task, sure, but not one these Mets haven’t shown they can handle\nkaplanj@phillynews.com\n@jakemkaplan", "external_links": ["http://philly.stats.com/mlb/teamstats.asp?team=22&type=stats", "http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=article&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2FMLB_Philadelphia_Phillies"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:31:06.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
