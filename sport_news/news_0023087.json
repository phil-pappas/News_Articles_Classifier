With four seniors on the team, the Crusaders already are looking to the future. Comment Posted Oct. 19, 2015 at 12:26 AM PERRY TWP. Winning a state championship is never an easy feat. But trying to defend a title can prove to be even more difficult. The Central Catholic golf team traveled to NorthStar Golf Club in hopes of doing just that, but fell just short, earning a second-place finish at the Division II state golf tournament Saturday. The Crusaders, as well as the rest of the field, battled chilly, blustery conditions during Saturday’s final round. The weather made things difficult on the course, leading to Bexley coming from behind to deny Central’s repeat bid. “It was cold and windy,” Central head coach Dave Oates said. “It wasn’t that great Friday either; it was a little warmer. But it was pretty tough to play (Saturday). We played really well on Friday and really mediocre on Saturday. ... There are some teams that played really well and there were some really good individual scores, so you could still play well with the weather.” Bexley’s two-day score of 617 bested Central’s 627. While the Crusaders enjoyed a four-shot lead after Day 1 of the tournament Friday, Bexley shot a team score of 311 on Day 2, 14 shots better than second-place Central. “They played great,” Oates said of Bexley. “We played with them both days, and they were very steady. Really, I thought it was going to end up being between us two. You have to play well both days, and they had two really solid rounds.” Bexley’s Cameron Karmia and Oakwood’s Connor Quigley were the co-medalists at the event, each shooting a tournament-low 143 during the two days. Central was led by Jarrod Kasunick, one of the team’s four seniors in the lineup. Kasunick shot a 153, including a 76 on Saturday, and earned first-team All-Ohio honors. Both Evan Jenkins (155) and Ryan Mallette (158) earned second-team honors. Those three players, along with the team’s fourth senior, Mark Mokros, ended their high school playing careers at the tournament. Mokros tallied a 161 in the two-day event. Oates says that group, one that has been the core of his team for years, certainly will be missed. “Those guys had a great career and it has been an awfully fun ride with them,” Oates said. “These kids are great to be around everyday and they worked their butts off for four years to get better.” The group left its mark on the program, winning Central’s third golf state title a year ago to go along with 2013’s fourth-place finish and this season’s runner-up effort at state. Oates hopes the dedication and work ethic that his graduating seniors displayed during the course of the last four years will trickle down into some of their younger teammates, including junior Noak Drlik, who made his state tournament debut this year. Page 2 of 2 - For a program that has enjoyed six consecutive bids to the state tournament, the future of the team now relies on the improvement of others who will need to replace the Crusaders’ four state tournament participants. Oates already is excited about a crop of underclassmen that will get an opportunity at varsity roles next season and believes that group can take on the same mindset as the current team’s leaders. “They worked really hard together to get better,” Oates said of Kasunick, Mallette, Mokros and Jenkins. “I think that’s a great message to send to our younger guys. Hopefully, two or three years from now, we are in the same situation where I have four or five kids in a class that just really care about each other and work hard. That’s what these guys did.” Reach Joe at 330-775-1129 or joe.mitchin @indeonline.com.
