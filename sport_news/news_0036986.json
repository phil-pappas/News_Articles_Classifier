Seattle did manage to win its last game without Lynch, on Monday night against the Lions. But taking care of the Bengals on the road without their workhorse back, could prove to be a much more daunting challenge for the two-time defending NFC champions. \nIloka and Gilberry were both listed as \"questionable\" on Friday, which gives them a 25% chance of suiting up come Sunday. The Bengals are looking to improve to 5-0 this season. \n\nPhoto Courtesy: AP Photo/Jeffrey Phelps, File", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:27:57.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
