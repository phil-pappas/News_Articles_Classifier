Lakers Waive Robert Upshaw, Michael Frazier II The Los Angeles Lakers announced two cuts on Tuesday with Michael Frazier II and Robert Upshaw no longer part of the team Privacy Policy | More Newsletters Getty Images The Los Angeles Lakers waived Robert Upshaw, the team announced on Tuesday, October 20, 2015.

(Photo by Gene Sweeney Jr/Getty Images) The Los Angeles Lakers waived Robert Upshaw and Michael Frazier II on Tuesday, making the Lakers’ 2015-16 roster easier to predict and analyze. With Upshaw getting cut, the Lakers now have 17 players, a number that needs to decrease down to 15 for the regular season roster. Byron Scott says they saw “flashes” of what Robert Upshaw could do, but ultimately “big time learning curve on both ends of the floor.” Lakers Top Blazers at Staples Center Current Roster Starting big, Roy Hibbert and Robert Sacre are true centers, with Tarik Black included in that category, though Black's height and athleticism hint that he could play as a power forward. Brandon Bass is also an option at center according to Lakers coach Byron Scott, especially considering Ryan Kelly has had a strong preseason. Kelly clearly established that he's not a small forward a season ago. Also, acrobatic and energetic rookie Larry Nance will fight for garbage time minutes in the front court. With Julius Randle starting at power forward and Hibbert starting at center, the backup roles in the front court promise healthy competition. At small forward, Scott has Kobe Bryant, Nick Young and rookie Anthony Brown. Metta World Peace is also an option at this position considering the crowd waiting to play at power forward. Of the foursome, World Peace is most in danger of not making the cut. Jonathan Holmes is out injured due to a dislocated shoulder suffered in Monday's win over Portland, so the Lakers are still on the hook for his salary while he's out injured. Holmes, however, appeared next in line to be waived, and the injury surely will not help his case to stay with the team long term. In the backcourt, the Lakers have Jordan Clarkson, Lou Williams and D'Angelo Russell unquestionably making the roster. Marcelo Huertas had impressed enough prior to the start of training camp that his two games worth of eye-opening play have locked in another spot on the team. Had his hamstring not recovered in time to showcase his superior passing talents, the 32-year-old Brazilian may have booking a flight back to Barcelona, where he previously played professionally. After being waived a year ago, Jabari Brown joined the Lakers midway through the 2014-15 season following a stint on the D-Fenders, the Lakers' NBA Development League associate. Brown is definitely in the conversation for the final spot. Who Will be Waived Next? If Holmes is dropped as expected, the Lakers still have one cut to make. The decision essentially requires deciding between waiving an undersized scoring guard in Jabari Brown, cutting a veteran and former champion in World Peace and cutting a defensive big body like Sacre. This is a tough decision for the Lakers' defensive-minded coach. World Peace is least likely to get the ax considering his history with the team and his work with Randle over the summer. The coach has spoken glowingly about the veteran's attitude and willingness to teach younger players, namely Randle. World Peace's role may have the smallest effect on wins and losses this season, but he may well be the most instrumental in developing Randle and the Lakers' long-term future. World Peace can still play defense, and that fact alone should keep him on the team. The announcement of Upshaw's cut seemingly secured Sacre's spot, and the Canadian is generally considered a positive personality in the locker room and on the practice floor. He works hard in practice and came to camp in better shape than a season ago. More than likely, Upshaw being waived signaled a fourth season for the former Gonzaga Bulldog, unless Scott goes against his nature and picks a small ball team. Brown can score the basketball, but his size hurts him defensively. Offensively, though, he can get up shots and put points on the board in a hurry. With both Williams and Young available to serve as second unit scorers, Brown's spot on the team may be most in danger. The Lakers expect to announce the final two cuts in the coming days.
