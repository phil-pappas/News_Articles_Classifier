Comment By Eric Avidon/Daily News Staff Milford Daily News By Eric Avidon/Daily News Staff Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 7:30 PM By Eric Avidon/Daily News Staff Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 7:30 PM CHESTNUT HILL — Steve Addazio said on Monday that he would name a starting quarterback this week. And he has, only he hasn’t made it public. When sophomore Darius Wade suffered a season-ending broken ankle in Boston College’s Week Three loss to Florida State, Addazio had a choice between true freshman Jeff Smith and redshirt freshman Troy Flutie, neither of whom had played a meaningful collegiate snap. So rather than immediately name one the new starter, Addazio decided to play both and hope that a clear choice would emerge based on the way each practiced during the week and played on weekends. That didn’t happen. Both struggled to move the offense with any consistency, so the two-quarterback system lagged on for three games. Now, as BC prepares for a trip to play Clemson, the No. 5 team in the nation, in prime-time on Saturday night, there’s a clear-cut starter. In his final session of the week with the media on Wednesday, Addazio expounded on what went into the decision, but did so without naming names. And on Thursday, when the final depth chart for the week was released, quarterback was still listed at Smith or Flutie. “We know what we’re doing (at quarterback),” Addazio said after Wednesday’s practice. “We’ve made some decisions this week. I’m not announcing that right now, but I may toward the end of the week.” Addazio would have liked to have had a quarterback in waiting in case Wade went down, but there was a gap between Chase Rettig and BC’s current crop of young quarterbacks because the quarterbacks who had been recruited under Frank Spaziani were traditional dropback passers and didn’t fit the system Addazio likes to employ featuring a mobile quarterback. Addazio was able to buy a year with graduate transfer Tyler Murphy last fall, but this year had to turn the position over to the inexperienced Wade and now his even more inexperienced backups. When Wade ultimately got hurt, Addazio simply hadn’t seen enough of Smith and Flutie to know who would be the best choice. It took three games, but now Addazio feels he has seen enough of both to make an informed decision. “We gathered as much information as we could — if it was a real clear picture we never would have went through the process we went through — and we have a body of work,” said Addazio. “We got some guys some experience. And now we feel like we’re in a situation where we want to move in a direction that we think is going to best suit where we are right now. Does that mean that’s for life? No. ... We all know that could change for a host of reasons — somebody could get hurt, somebody could just not be playing well — but we definitely want to move in one direction now.” Page 2 of 2 - As for who the choice might be, it’s impossible to know. Recent signs, however, point toward Smith. After Flutie played the bulk of the second half of BC’s loss to Duke two weeks ago — and moved the offense well — it was instead Smith who played the majority of last Saturday’s loss to Wake Forest. And in the immediate aftermath of that loss, Addazio said the team had “kind of” settled in to one quarterback during the game. This week, though only a sliver of practice is open to the media, Smith was leading the first-team during that brief period. Smith is by far the better runner of the two, leading the Eagles with 257 yards and a 6.7 yards per carry average compared with 50 yards and a 2.5 yards per carry average for Flutie. Flutie, meanwhile, is the better passer, completing 54 percent of his passes with three touchdowns and one interception compared with a 30 percent completion rate and one interception with no touchdowns for Smith. What may separate Smith from Flutie, however, is the frequency with which he can make explosive plays with his legs compared with the frequency Flutie has shown in making explosive plays with his arm. “This situation we’re in is stressful because you’re putting guys at a position before their time,” said Addazio, “and that’s clearly the facts of the matter. Having said that, each guy has a set of abilities, but nothing is consistent. If one thing was consistent you could hang your hat on that, but it’s really not, so we have to go with what we feel is the best chance for our team to be the most explosive that it can be.” Either Smith or Flutie, after three weeks of competition, has finally won the job of starting quarterback. But it might not be known which one until the Eagles take the field Saturday night in Death Valley. Eric Avidon can be reachd at 508-626-3809 or eavidon@wickedlocal.com.
