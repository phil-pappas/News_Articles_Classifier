Otherwise political struggles will be a thing of the past, it pointed out.\n“Because of Pakistan’s anti-India activities, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has to address the nation from behind a bullet-proof glass. Pakistan will kill our jawans, threaten us. Should we lay red carpet for Pakistanis on the blood of our martyrs?” it asked.\nIt said “the Shiv Sena has never compromised on Maharashtra’s self- respect and national security. The party is a shining example of hardcore Hindutva. The Sena is the only political party which has never betrayed its people for the sake of power,” it said.\n“Strong nationalism and Hindutva flourished in this land because of icons like Lokmanya Tilak, Chhatrapati Shivaji and Veer Savarkar. They have fought tooth and nail against the country’s enemies. Nobody should lecture Shivaji’s Maharashtra about tolerance,” it said.\nThe Sena said it is capable of “countering any move to get it declared by the UN as a terrorist outfit”. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:07:42.843+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
