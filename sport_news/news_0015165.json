Johnny Edward: \nSuper Eagles coach Sunday Oliseh has highlighted the motivator factors behind his team’s scintillating showing against the Indomitable Lions of Cameroun last Sunday in Brussels, Completesportsnigeria.com reports. \nThe Eagles who had earlier lost 2-0 to DR Congo three days earlier following the upheaval between Oliseh and stripped skipper Vincent Enyeama bounced back to winning ways with a 3-0 demolition of Volker Finke's side, to restored public confidence in the team. \n“Sincerely, we came to Belgium to play Cameroun. That was the first and only game we had to play. We were looking for a second game to play, and initially, we wanted to play Genk, a club side and then they told us Congo was available,” Oliseh further reviewed the match in Brussels. \n“And I must say that, tactically, we decided to bring our ‘A’ game against Cameroun but that notwithstanding these players are professional players and in the team they see their coach been criticized unfairly with such lies but then again they felt the best way to react was to play well and beat the Indomitable Lions.\" \nOliseh however revealed that he was impressed at the way his players celebrated every goals against Cameroun but was quick to add that the move by the players wasn’t in solidarity for him to keep his job. \n“I was so impressed each time they scored and they ran towards me to celebrate those goals. To me it was like sending a message to the world. \n“My job is not at stake, is it by winning friendlies or losing them you get sacked? I just signed and we did that with objectives: qualify Nigeria for the tournaments ahead. The worst is that you get sacked!. \n“I’m not under pressure as I have experienced it as a player in the past as well.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:32:08.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
