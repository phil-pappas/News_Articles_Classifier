The firefighters assumed they were cleaning up the wreckage from a traffic fatality. \nBut none of them knew at the time the patient in the back of the ambulance was a four-time Olympic medallist and two-time world champion in speedskating. \nDenny Morrison broke his femur, punctured his lung, ruptured his kidneys and bruised his heart when his motorcycle crashed into a left-turning car on May 7 near the University of Calgary. He also suffered a concussion, tore a knee ligament and chipped his spine. The impact of the collision knocked the car over on its side. \nSomehow, perhaps in part due to his incredible fitness level, Morrison survived. Five months after the fact, he’s back skating circles — quickly, by most people’s standards — at the Olympic Oval. \nThis is a guy who could barely stand four days after the crash. He needed to sit down to have a shower. He used a cane to limp from one place to another. \n“To see Denny in a hospital bed was definitely tough,” fellow Olympian Gilmore Junio said Monday. “I think of the guy like Superman. He’s always coming back from crazy injuries. He’s always coming back from major defeats. To see Superman in his weakest state like that is definitely tough. I choked up at first. But he’s always had a really good outlook on it. I’m there to support him in any way I can in his recovery and finding his way back to Superman form.” \nAlways one to shoot high, Morrison, 30, initially set a goal of competing in the first World Cup of the season Nov. 13-15 in Calgary. As the leaves fall from the trees and the days go by, the Fort St. John, B.C. native is still holding out hope for a return to competition on home ice. \nRealistically, however, he might need to wait until December to compete in Europe. And even that might be overly optimistic. \nBrian Rahill, the high performance director for Speed Skating Canada, said he would be thrilled to see his star athlete compete for the first time in February at the world single distance championships in Kolomna, Russia. \n“To me, it’s inspirational,” Rahill said of watching Morrison train at the Oval. “If someone can come back from this, it’s Denny, but I don’t expect anything from him this year.” \nDon’t go telling that to Morrison, who expects big things from himself daily. To chart his recovery from the crash, he sets attainable goals and celebrates crossing them off the list. \nHis first goal in hospital was to stand on his right leg (which now includes a titanium rod.) He lasted all of a minute before the pain became too great and he fell asleep for three hours due to sheer exhaustion. \nThen he set out to attend his brother’s wedding, one week to the day of the accident, in northern B.C. The doctor initially scoffed, but Morrison passed all the tests (he admits to studying for the concussion exam based on material he found on the internet) and made it for the big day. \nThen came a series of other milestones from ditching the crutches to riding a stationary bike to skating in baggy sweat pants and a helmet. \nIn the beginning, he took 40 seconds to complete a 400-metre lap. Three weeks ago, he crossed the line in 26 seconds. \nPretty impressive, for most of us, but Morrison can normally whip around the track in less than 24 seconds. \n“There’s no point in rushing back,” said Morrison, who won the 2014/15 World Cup overall title over 1,500 metres. “What will really make this a cool story is making it to the Pyeongchang Olympics in 2018 and recovering fully and having a really good race there.” \nMorrison received a $155 ticket for running a yellow light in connection with the collision. The two occupants of the other vehicle were not hospitalized. The matter is still mired in insurance proceedings. \nWith his teammates readying themselves for the Canadian World Cup trials this weekend, Morrison could lapse into a fit of self-pity over what promises to be a long recovery with no guarantee of a happy ending. But he won’t. \n“I’m lucky to be alive,” he said. “I’m lucky to have the team that I have to help me make this recovery. I’m lucky to have my friends, and family and the support I had in the hospital. There’s tons of things you have to feel lucky about. You just have to allow yourself to feel lucky about them and not feel like you’re a victim.” \nMEMORY LOSS AFTER CRASH \nDenny Morrison had no idea where he was when he came to in the intensive care unit the day after the May 7 motorcycle crash that nearly cost him his life. \nFirst, the doctors asked for his name. The four-time Olympic medallist knew he was Denny Morrison. \nBut when it came to time and geography, he thought it was the last week of April and that he was still on holidays in New Zealand -- not in a hospital bed in Calgary. \nHis mind somehow erased 10 days of his life. \n“It was the weirdest conversation to have,\" Morrison says. “It’s the kind of thing you see in the movies. It was like something out of the Terminator. That was the most frightening part of the whole thing for me to wake up and have them asking all these questions and then they’re telling me they’ve surgically implanted a titanium rod into my leg.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:58:04.432+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
