MacArthur holds on to beat Churchill 1 / 1 Back to Gallery After seeming to have the game in hand, MacArthur sweated out the final minutes to beat Churchill 35-28 on Friday at Heroes Stadium.\nThe Brahmas led 35-14 late in the fourth quarter before the Chargers were able to pull within two scores on a 78-yard pass play from Devon Faktor to De’Andre Reed.
