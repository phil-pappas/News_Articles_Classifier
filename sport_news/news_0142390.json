We were not able to overcome that because we were not hitting the ball like we normally can.” \nThe Cubs’ offense was left paralyzed, scoring just eight runs in the series, with only eight extra-base hits. Mets' Daniel Murphy homers in MLB-record sixth straight postseason game \nGoodness, Mets second baseman Daniel Murphy drove in nearly as many runs —six — by himself as the entire Cubs roster. He became the first player in major league history to homer in six consecutive postseason games with his two-run shot in the eighth inning, batting .529 in the series, and winning the NLCS MVP award. \nIt left the Cubs so dazed and confused that 38-year-old catcher David Ross lost track of the count with Mets rookie starter Steven Matz at the plate. He ran off the field into the dugout, while his teammates started to follow him, until they realized Matz had only two strikes on him. \nPardon the crowd of 42,227 for wanting to hide with Ross, watching the Mets take a 4-0 lead before Matz even batted, and a 6-0 lead by the second inning. \nIt was the kind of night the Cubs have endured, oh, so frequently these last 107 years, since their last World Series title. \n“I think everybody’s frustrated,” pitcher Jon Lester said. “This isn’t how we wanted it to go and how we had it envisioned.” \nThe crowd was just as frustrated and a whole lot more angry, booing Cubs starter Jason Hammel off the mound, after he gave up five runs and six baserunners in 11/3 innings. And they gave a loud, sarcastic cheer when the Cubs finally got their first baserunner on Ross’ two-out walk in the third inning. Mets sweep Cubs, advance to World Series \nIt was like Groundhog Day the entire series. The Mets’ pitching staff was so dominant, retiring 33 of the 36 Cubs’ hitters from the end of the first inning in Game3 to the fourth inning Wednesday. \n“It’s pretty impressive to see what these guys have done,” Lester said. “You don’t really ever see their demeanor change. \n“They attack the strike zone. On the biggest stage they attack the strike zone, which is hard to do sometimes. But, yeah, it’s been impressive to watch.” \nThe Mets, featuring a star-studded, fire-throwing, rotation with no one older than 27, showcased their talent for all of the world to see. The Mets’ rotation has struck out 69 batters in the postseason and 29 in their NLCS sweep. \n“Their stuff is there,” Mets outfielder Michael Cuddyer said. “It’s been there the whole year. Now it’s on the big stage.” \nMatz, 24, was just the latest showoff. He made only six career regular-season starts, the second fewest in history by any postseason pitcher, but looked like a 20-year veteran on the mound. He retired the first eight batters he faced, and the Cubs didn’t have a hit until the fourth inning. The Cubs finally got him out of the game with two outs in the fifth inning, but the Mets’ bullpen, which never gave up a run the entire series, shut down the Cubs the rest of the game. \n“When you have young pitching with power arms, the thing that impresses you the most are the strikes,” Mets manager Terry Collins said. “As a matter of fact, we throw too many strikes sometimes. You look at the success of some of the great pitchers in the game, and they’ll get ahead of you, and you might not see another strike the entire at-bat. \n“They pound the strike zone.” \nCertainly, the Mets’ pennant, their first since 2000, is sweet vindication for Collins and Mets general manager Sandy Alderson, who spent all summer under the microscope for their handling of the young staff. They employed a six-man rotation at times. They skipped starts. They put a limit on pitch counts. 9 things to know about Mets postseason hero Daniel Murphy \nNow, the Mets’ staff will have plenty of rest, with six days off before playing Game1 of the World Series against the winner of Kansas City Royals-Toronto Blue Jays ALCS. \n“I’m looking at guys here in the month of October, which none of these guys have ever performed in,” Collins said, “still throwing the ball 98-mph. This tells me we did the right things leading up to this. Now we’ve just got to go play it out. \n“I’m not looking for vindication. I believed in the system, what we did. Yeah, we had some controversy along the way, but it comes with the territory for me.” \nWhile the Mets’ pitching staff stole the show, really, they manhandled the Cubs in every phase of the game. When Murphy wasn’t hitting homers — and he set a postseason record with a mammoth drive to dead center field in the eighth inning of Game 4 — there was Lucas Duda driving in five runs, including his three-run homer in the first inning that broke the game open. \nWhen they weren’t blasting the ball to all fields, they were stealing bases, almost as will. \n“They outplayed us all around,” Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo said. “Pitching, defense, running the bases.” \nThere was no bigger surprise than the Mets’ running game. They stole a league-low 51 bases during the season, but stole seven bases against the Cubs. \n“We came in knowing that we had to be a little aggressive on the bases, something we don’t normally do,” Collins said. “We’re not that kind of a team. But we told the guys, ‘Look, if you get on and you think you can go, go.’” \nThey went. Again and again. \n“It was an excellent game plan by our coaching staff,” Mets third baseman David Wright said, “letting us try to run wild on the basepaths, and if we had a lead early, to put your foot on the gas and try to go. \n“That was kind of our mantra coming into the playoffs, to put pressure on the defense.” The simple secret to MLB playoff success: Put the ball in play \nThe Cubs called it a great learning experience, and although their season is over, they’ll be back on this stage again. They had four star-studded rookies in their everyday lineup, and with their plethora of minor-league talent and financial clout, they’ll grab at least one more starter while remaking their bullpen. \nAnd when they show up next spring in Mesa, Ariz., don’t be surprised if they’ll be the World Series favorites. \n“This is a really good experience for everybody,” says Cubs catcher Miguel Montero. “Obviously, coming in next year for spring training there’s going to be an even higher expectation. The guys know what it feels like to be on this type of stage, and I hope every guy next year will come back even hungrier than this year.” \nWho knows, considering their future, this may turn out to be the weakest Cubs team they’ll have for the next five years. \n“I often times look out on the field,” Maddon said, “and I think, “Wow, to think about the level of experience that these guys have had to this point and where they’ve gotten us already, that’s pretty impressive. \n“This is just the beginning for these guys. As our guys learn the game even better, just knowing what they’re doing at the plate, what the pitcher’s trying to do to them, adjustments to be made, that’s going to be really exciting to watch over the next couple of years.” \nFollow Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale \nGALLERY: METS, CUBS CLASH IN NLCS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:58:19.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
