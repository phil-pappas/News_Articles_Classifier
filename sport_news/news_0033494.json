He also gained 66 yards on four receptions, including a 22-yard touchdown run and a 25-yard kickoff return, and scored a 2-point conversion. \nSenior wide receiver Allie Freeman, who broke the state record for career receptions last week against Prescott and was honored for the achievement before Friday's game, added 7 receptions and 106 yards, bringing his career reception total to 268 for 4,957 yards. He also caught two touchdown passes, scored four 2-point conversions and intercepted Centerpoint quarterback Kennan Owens twice. \nThe Wildcats had 730 yards of total offense. Junior quarterback Jacob Howard was responsible for 431 of those yards through the air, and threw four touchdown passes, including a 41-yard touchdown pass to RJ Rice. \nThe Knights had 533 yards of total offense. Owens, running back Deven Horn, and wide receivers Lance Chambers and Dustin Forsythe accounted for all of Centerpoint's touchdowns. \n\"We expected a shootout, to be quite honest with you,\" said Episcopal Coach Richie Marsh. \"We knew we had to outscore them.\" \n\"Believe it or not, we don't like playing these types of games,\" Marsh said. \"We like to play better defense.\" \nSports on 10/10/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:07:38.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
