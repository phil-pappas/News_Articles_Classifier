And though there may not be a heavyweight matchup this weekend, danger is always there for title contenders as evidenced by the narrow victories of Ohio State and Michigan State last week.\nHere's a look at the decisive factors in five of Saturday's biggest contests (all times Eastern):\nNorthwestern running game vs. Michigan defense The Wolverines have allowed 14 points in four games since their loss to Utah, including shutouts of BYU and Maryland the past two weeks. They're second in the nation in scoring defense. Who is No. 1? That's the Wildcats, who surprisingly have started 5-0 despite having an offense ranked 89th in scoring.\nPoints are going to be at a premium, so Northwestern has to find a way to move the ball the Big House. Michigan's offense is going to be delivering body blows with its running game for four quarters. Success will have to start with Justin Jackson and the Wildcats offensive line finding running lanes to take pressure of freshman quarterback Clayton Thorson. Left to win the game himself, Thorson is going to be overmatched against the Wolverines in a hostile environment. But if Jackson can find success, that will create space in the passing game and maybe finally dent the Michigan defense.\nCalifornia quarterback Jared Goff is off to a hot start and the Golden Bears are 5-0 on the season. (Photo: Jennifer Nicholson, USA TODAY Spor)\nJared Goff vs. Utah secondary The Golden Bears are another of college football's biggest surprises, and their resurgence has come on the arm of their standout quarterback. Goff has thrown for 1,583 yards and 15 touchdowns and drawn comparisons to former Berkeley standout Aaron Rodgers.\nCal is back in the Top 25 and one win from qualifying for their first bowl since 2011. Now comes the hard part: Figure out a way to beat the Utes in Salt Lake. Utah's secondary is talented enough to match up with the Golden Bears receivers, and the Utes defensive backs force turnovers. The group has seven interceptions in four game, including five against its most touted opponents â€” Michigan and Oregon. The takeaways and ball security on offense have helped Utah rank in the top 10 in turnover margin.\nNothing is going to be easy for California. Goff must avoid mistakes and be patient even if his team gets down. Turnovers will give the home side and crowd more momentum and put the Bears defense in a tough spot.\nKansas State defense vs. Trevone Boykin The Wildcats won't be able to stop TCU's Heisman Trophy candidate, who leads the nation's No. 2 scoring offense. But they have to find a way to slow down the Frogs. Easier said than done.\nKansas State does have the advantage of strong front seven that has limited opponents to just 71 rushing yards per game. The hope is that by making TCU one-dimensional, it can better defend Josh Doctson and Boykin's other weapons and avoid getting in a shootout. That's the recipe for success, because Kansas State doesn't exactly know what to expect from its offense. Injuries at quarterback have turned what was once a position of depth into uncertainty. Fourth-stringer Kody Cook replaced Joe Hubener against Oklahoma State before he injured his shoulder. Hubener is expected to be cleared from his head injury, but it all adds up to a situation where playing from behind is going to be untenable against the Horned Frogs.\nGeorgia vs. Disappointment Greyson Lambert and the Georgia offense walks off the field against Alabama. (Photo: Kevin C. Cox, Getty Images)\nThere's an adage that coaches often cite after a tough loss: You don't let an opponent beat you twice. Losing on the field is one thing. Losing the next week because your team doesn't bring its best effort isn't acceptable. That's the situation that faces the Bulldogs on their trip to Tennessee.\nGeorgia was anticipating the Alabama game all offseason as it hoped to prove its program was ready to contend for a national title. That feeling of promise ended after being steamrolled by the Crimson Tide. How the Bulldogs react will determine if they remain in SEC title race or fall back into the natural cycle of unfulfilled seasons in Athens.\nAlabama exposed holes in the Georgia offense as quarterback Greyson Lambert struggled in his first taste of a nasty defense. The Volunteers aren't the same caliber of Alabama, but they will be playing hard in a must-win at home. The Bulldogs have to match their intensity to win on both lines of scrimmage. This will allow Nick Chubb and Sony Michel to carry the offense and also slow down Tennessee's running game. If they don't, Georgia will be feeling low on Rocky Top.\nAl Golden vs. Jimbo Fisher Golden's tenure has been unsettled since allegations of boosters paying Miami players surfaced before his first game. Four seasons later, there's unrest among fans as the Hurricanes remain mired in the middle of the ACC while digging out of NCAA sanctions. That frustration has been on display with airplane banners asking for Golden's firing. So now is not exactly the best time for Miami to be heading into Tallahassee for a showdown with rival Florida State.\nGolden has never beaten Fisher in the four meetings, and Fisher is unbeaten against the Hurricanes since he succeeded Bobby Bowden in 2010. There is some hope for Miami with Seminoles running back Dalvin Cook dealing with an injured hamstring. If quarterback Brad Kaaya can have a big game throwing, that would open the door for the Hurricanes to pull a surprise and maybe cool off the hot seat on which Golden sits.\nPHOTOS: THE TOP 10 GAMES OF WEEK 6\nIndiana at Penn State, Saturday at noon on ESPN2 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 9 Oklahoma vs. Texas in Dallas, Saturday at noon ET on ABC USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 16 Georgia at Tennessee, Saturday at 3:30 p.m. ET on CBS USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 2 TCU at Kansas State, Saturday at 7:30 p.m. ET on FOX USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 12 Florida at Missouri, Saturday at 7:30 p.m. on SEC Network USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 19 Oklahoma State at West Virginia, Saturday at 7 p.m. ET on ESPN2 USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Miami at No. 8 Florida State, Saturday at 8 p.m. on ABC USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Navy at No. 15 Notre Dame, Saturday at 3:30 p.m. on NBC USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 14 Northwestern at No. 21 Michigan, Saturday at 3:30 p.m. on Big Ten Network USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen No. 22 California at No. 7 Utah, Saturday at 10 p.m.ET on ESPN USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Like this topic?
