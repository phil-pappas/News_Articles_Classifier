On Saturday afternoon, Torey Lovullo talked about the importance of power pitching going forward for a Red Sox team that lacks it. Saturday night and a 2-0 Red Sox loss to the Indians showed why. On a brisk October evening in Cleveland — the 49-degree temperature at first pitch was the coldest for a Red Sox game in five months — Corey Kluber rendered Boston's bats numb. The reigning American League Cy Young, in his final start before abdicating that throne, held the Sox to three hits over eight dominant innings. With Kluber on his game early, making contact seemed a victory for Boston. Kluber struck out six of seven hitters at one point, with the only exception a walk. Only two of the first 11 Red Sox batters managed to put the ball in play, and they hit only eight balls to the outfield over eight innings. Back east, Max Scherzer tossed his second no-hitter of the season, a masterpiece with 17 strikeouts, against the Mets. The flailing swings of batters from Boston and New York on Saturday were a reminder that, while power pitching is good all the time, it's at its best when the weather turns cold and the significance of each game intensifies. It's no secret that the Red Sox will be looking to add a front-line starting pitcher this winter, probably one who throws hard. Dombrowski had the foresight to trade for Scherzer in Detroit, giving up the player who made the last out against him Saturday night in Curtis Granderson. Cleveland GM Chris Antonetti was wise enough to get Kluber back in a three-way deal for Jake Westbrook in 2010, at a time when Kluber was posting minor-league ERAs north of four. The hunt for that power pitcher will drive Boston's winter, and its success may define the organization's autumns going forward. For the second straight Saturday, Craig Breslow gave the Red Sox everything they could have hoped for. The left-hander worked into the sixth inning, allowing just a pair of solo home runs to right-handed hitters. Carlos Santana took him deep in the second, and Ryan Raburn smashed a ball halfway up the left-field bleachers in the fourth. A week after throwing the most innings and second-most pitches in a game in his career, Breslow set new personal marks on Saturday night. He finished 5 1/3 innings on 66 pitches, allowing the two runs on five hits. He didn’t walk a batter. He did his job. The loss dropped the Red Sox back into last place in the American League East. They cannot finish the season ahead of anyone else in the division for the third time in four years.
