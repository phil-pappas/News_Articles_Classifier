Which teams with legit playoff hopes can survive the loss of key stars? Week 4 should provide some answers. Here are my picks:\nat \nNew York Jets (2-1) at Miami (1-2) in London \nSunday, Oct. 4, 9:30 a.m. ET (CBS, CBSSports.com Live Stream) \nThe Dolphins seemed lifeless in losing to the Bills last week. How will they respond after a long trip with a coach who is clearly on the hot seat now? The Jets came back to reality last week in losing at home to the Eagles . I think Miami will find a way to get back on track here against a Jets offense that is limited.\nThe Pick: Dolphins 21, Jets 17\nat \nJacksonville (1-2) at Indianapolis (1-2) \nSunday, Oct. 4, 1 p.m. ET (CBS) \nThe Jaguars are playing consecutive road games, which is always tough. They were awful against the Patriots , and have a ton of injuries. Andrew Luck seemed to find some things late in the victory over the Titans . That will carry over here. Colts take it.\nThe Pick: Colts 33, Jaguars 18\nat \nNew York Giants (1-2) at Buffalo (2-1) \nSunday, Oct. 4, 1 p.m. ET (FOX) \nThe Bills looked dominant last week at Miami, while the Giants got their first victory against Redskins . The Giants will have 10 days off before this game, but this is a tough challenge at Buffalo. The Bills defensive line will get after Eli Manning and force some turnovers that matter. Buffalo goes to 3-1.\nThe Pick: Bills 28, Giants 20\nat \nCarolina (3-0) at Tampa Bay (1-2) \nSunday, Oct. 4, 1 p.m. ET (FOX) \nThe Panthers are 3-0 thanks in large part to Cam Newton . He is playing great football. In their opener, Tampa Bay's only home game, the defense struggled big time. They've improved since, but look for Newton to have another good day. Panthers stay unbeaten.\nThe Pick: Panthers 21, Bucs 13\nat \nPhiladelphia (1-2) at Washington (1-2) \nSunday, Oct. 4, 1 p.m. ET (FOX) \nThe Eagles got back on track against the Jets last week after their two losses to open the season. This is a second consecutive road game, which can be tough. But it's a short trip and the Eagles are the better team. Kirk Cousins came back to reality against the Giants. It continues here.\nThe Pick: Eagles 24, Redskins 14\nat \nOakland (2-1) at Chicago (0-3) \nSunday, Oct. 4, 1 p.m. ET (CBS) \nThe Bears are 0-3 and will be playing Jimmy Clausen again. That's not good. The Raiders are playing well at 2-1, but this is a second consecutive road game. The Bears haven't played well, but the defense did some good things last week at Seattle. They do so here. Upset special.\nThe Pick: Bears 23, Raiders 20\nat \nHouston (1-2) at Atlanta (3-0) \nSunday, Oct. 4, 1 p.m. ET (CBS) \nThe 3-0 Falcons are back home after two tough road victories. The Matt Ryan - Julio Jones combination is coming up big, and it should here, too. The key will be how they block J.J. Watt . But if it's a choice between Ryan and Ryan Mallett , that's an easy one. It's the Falcons' Ryan.\nThe Pick: Falcons 27, Texans 14\nat \nKansas City (1-2) at Cincinnati (3-0) \nSunday, Oct. 4, 1 p.m. ET (CBS) \nThis is a tough turnaround for the Chiefs after getting blown out Monday night by the Packers . The Bengals are playing really well right now and that will show up here. The Chiefs secondary will have no answer for A.J. Green . The Bengals get to 4-0.\nThe Pick: Bengals 28, Chiefs 20\nat \nCleveland (1-2) at San Diego (1-2) \nSunday, Oct. 4, 4:05 p.m. ET (CBS) \nThis is a long trip for the Browns , who aren't playing well. Josh McCown is back in as the starter, but should he be? The Chargers are back home after two road losses, and they will play like they are happy to be there. This could get ugly. Philip Rivers has a big day.\nPick: Chargers 30, Browns 16\nat \nGreen Bay (3-0) at San Francisco (1-2) \nSunday, Oct. 4, 4:25 p.m. ET (FOX) \nThe Packers are the best team in the league and have the best quarterback. The 49ers are struggling in large part because their quarterback is struggling. Colin Kaepernick has to be better. The Packers play on a short turnaround, so that could factor. No, it won't. Aaron Rodgers lights it up again.\nThe Pick: Packers 34, 49ers 16\nat \nSt. Louis (1-2) at Arizona (3-0) \nSunday, Oct. 4, 4:25 p.m. ET (FOX) \nThe Cardinals are off to a 3-0 start and have looked good in doing so. Carson Palmer has been sensational, but he will face a tough challenge against that Rams front. The Arizona offensive line is much better, but this will be a challenge. Even so, look for Arizona to go to 4-0.\nThe Pick: Cardinals 23, Rams 10\nat \nMinnesota (2-1) at Denver (3-0) \nSunday, Oct. 4, 4:25 p.m. ET (FOX) \nThe Broncos are home after two road victories and they've gone back to being Peyton Manning 's offense. That matters. He looks so much more comfortable playing that way. Adrian Peterson got it going last week for Vikings , and he will need to come up big here. But I think the Denver defense, which has been really good so far this season, will come up big. Broncos take it.\nThe Pick: Broncos 20, Vikings 15\nat \nDallas (2-1) at New Orleans (0-3) \nSunday, Oct. 4, 8:30 p.m. ET (NBC) \nThis could be a battle of two backups in Luke McCown vs. Brandon Weeden . There is a chance Drew Brees could play as it looks like he will get work in practice. He's a tough guy, and I think he plays. The Saints are in desperation mode and they play like it here.\nThe Pick: Saints 24, Cowboys 13\nat \nDetroit (0-3) at Seattle (1-2) \nSunday, Oct. 4, 8:30 p.m. ET (ESPN) \nThe Seahawks seemed to right things when they got back home last week against the Bears, but the Lions will be a step up even as an 0-3 team. I just don't see the Lions going into Seattle and winning. Russell Wilson will have a good day and Matt Stafford will face a fierce pass rush.\nThe Pick: Seahawks 19, Lions 13\nat \nBaltimore (0-3) at Pittsburgh (2-1) \nThursday, Oct. 1, 8:25 p.m. ET (CBS/NFL Network) \nThe Steelers will be without Ben Roethlisberger , which means Michael Vick is in as the starter. That's a big-time challenge. The Ravens are 0-3 and reeling. This is a huge game for their season. Can they save it? I don't think so. Vick plays well.\nThe Pick: Steelers 27, Ravens 21 | The Result: Ravens 23, Steelers 20 (OT) Brandon Weeden won't be enough for Dallas vs. desperate New Orleans. (USATSI) Topics: A.J.
