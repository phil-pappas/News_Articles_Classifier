Green shook off early injuries to his left knee and ankle, and thrived in his new role behind Landon King in the I formation. \nGreen, who also played some snaps at quarterback in a new “Wild Rebel” formation, carried the ball 29 times for 278 yards and scored on touchdown runs of 8 and 80 yards. \n“That’s the best he’s ever run,” Martin said. “The offensive line did a great job. Everybody on the offense did a great job. … (Green) gutted it up and laid it on the line.” \nKing, Pineville’s junior fullback, rushed for 97 yards and a score while senior quarterback Clayton Wider Jr. rushed for three scores and piled up 189 combined yards passing and rushing. \nBut the Rebels’ 548 yards of total offense weren’t enough to overcome Beck and the outstanding Trojans’ offense of offensive coordinator Thomas Bachman. \nBeck, who has thrived in Bachman’s no-huddle, fast-paced offense, carved up the Rebels’ secondary, completing 25 of 36 passes and throwing touchdowns to four different receivers. \nPineville led by 12 points (26-14) midway through the second quarter, but the Trojans battled back when senior running back Kyle Smith scored his second touchdown of the game and Beck found Vallien for a 54-yard touchdown with 12 seconds remaining. \nWith the Trojans leading by two at the half, they came out and grabbed control in the third quarter. Beck threw touchdown passes to three different receivers – Andrew Bell, Tyler Clark and Suede Taylor – in the third quarter, the final one a back-breaking, 73-yard catch-and-run by Taylor (8-141, TD) that put ASH ahead 49-34. \n“I wasn’t throwing the best balls, but they made some great plays,” Beck said, deferring credit for his performance to his playmakers on the perimeter. \nASH coach Sam Goodwin, however, saw the game a little differently. \n“You can’t outrun his arm,” Goodwin said. “The last play of the half (the 54-yard TD pass to Vallien, who had six catches for 122 yards) … not many guys can make that throw.” \nTwo key special teams plays let the Rebels down. They missed their first extra point, a 35-yard attempt due to an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, and a second missed PAT in the fourth quarter prevented Pineville from cutting the deficit to one score. \nAfter Wider’s third touchdown run cut the score to 49-40 with 8:54 remaining, the Rebels missed a second extra point and needed a touchdown and a field goal to win. They drove inside the 5-yard line late in the game, but facing fourth and goal, Martin elected to attempt a field goal. \nThe snap was errant, and kicker Gavin Capehart’s pass for King in the end zone was batted down, as the Trojans ran out the clock for the victory. \n“It was a disappointing way to lose the game, but I couldn’t be more proud of the way we played,” Martin said. \n“It took everything we had to win the game,” Goodwin said. \nBeck, who improved to 2-2 in his career against the Rebels, said he was proud of the way his team fought for the victory. \n“We knew they would come out fighting (in the second half),” Beck said. “There was never a moment we thought they would lay down. There was never a moment we were going to lay down.” \nGoodwin said his team’s defense has given up too many big plays on the season. It cost the Trojans in their only loss against Leesville, and nearly cost them again Friday night. However, with their offense continually putting up 40-plus points per game, Goodwin said he likes his team’s chances moving forward. \n“I feel like we can compete with anybody,” Goodwin said. “I haven’t seen West Monroe, and that would be the one (that concerns me). If we can win this week, then we’ll worry about the next one after that.” Buy Photo \nPineville's Landon King (32) gains yards against ASH Friday.
