It's a chance for all of us to see more of the visually captivating private and public gardens that have helped make the Northwest famous among foliage and flower fans.\nYou can see the entries submitted so far and the range of topics amateur photographs have captured, from hummingbirds to maple trees.\nThere's another reason to look: You will soon be able to vote for your favorite and help someone win one of four $100 prizes plus have their photo posted online and in print.\nWhere is your photo? It's time for you to submit your online entry to the annual Homes & Gardens of the Northwest's Garden Photo Contest.\nThere's no theme; it's shooter's choice. As long as the original photo is taken in a garden -- public or private -- in the Pacific Northwest in the last year, it's eligible to win.\nThere will be four winners: Three selected by staff members of The Oregonian and Homes & Gardens of the Northwest and one voted on by the public . The winning photos and some runners-up will appear in the last issue of the Homes & Gardens of the Northwest and displayed on OregonLive.com.\nTen images will be selected by us as finalists and are eligible for your online vote as the People's Choice and fourth place winner.\nTo enter, submit your original digital photo at oregonlive.com/hg-photo between Oct. 21 and Oct. 31, 2015. It's quick and easy, and you can see the other entries.\nIf you have a printed photograph, have it scanned and made into a digital image to submit online. Large grocery store chains and copy service stores will scan and digitize your image onto a flashdrive. With that, you can go online and enter the contest.\nRULES to get you launched (see the complete rules)\nPhotos must be taken over the last year, between Oct. 31, 2014 and Oct. 31, 2015, in a garden in the Northwest.

TIPS AND IDEAS\nUsually, morning or late afternoon light is best. Avoid shooting between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., when overhead light is flat. Look for repetition of shapes, reflections, lovely designs in nature. Get close to your subject. Look for clean backgrounds. Good luck!\n-- Janet Eastman\njeastman@oregonian.com\n503-799-8739\n@janeteastman", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/janeteastman"], "published": "2015-10-26T17:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:18:15.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
