Division 2 Golf at Cranwell \nLENOX — Mount Greylock's Matt Wiseman, Drury's Nick Bator and Monument Mountain's Dylan Buffoni led the Berkshire County representatives during the Division II Western Massachusetts Golf Championship on Tuesday, earning spots as individuals in the Western Mass. State Final at Crumpin Fox Golf Club in Bernardston. \nNo teams from Berkshire County earned the top-two finish necessary to advance. Greylock placed fourth out of eight teams with a 349, and Wahconah seventh with a 395. Cathedral (331) and Belchertown (340) earned Division II state berths. The top six individuals advanced to the state final as well. Advertisement \nWiseman led all county finishers placing third overall, shooting a 78 at the Cranwell Golf Club. Bator tied for fourth with a 79. Buffoni tied for sixth with an 83. \n\"It feels great,\" Wiseman said on advancing to the state final. \"I played well, but I made a couple of silly mistakes, so I'm looking forward to Monday.\" \nStarting on hole number three, due to the shotgun start, Wiseman shot a 41 on the front nine. He lowered his score by four strokes on the back nine, thanks to an improved short game, giving him a 37. He added that a sliding par putt on the 11th really gave him momentum heading into the back nine. \n\"The greens are really sloped and a lot of the scoring is done around the greens,\" he said. \"I putted really well on the back nine and it really helped me lower my score. I just hit better shots as well.\" \nDespite Wiseman's success as an individual, Greylock coach Brian Gil said his team did not have its best performance on Tuesday. \n\"It's a decent result for us,\" he said. \"Matt played well, but across the board, the other five players would all say they were disappointed with their rounds. \n\"We're ecstatic about our share of the Berkshire County title, we're ecstatic that Matt's moving on, but we're a little disappointed as a team that we don't get to keep going.\" Nick Bator, of Drury, chips toward the flag at Cranwell during the Division 2 Western Mass Golf Tournament Tuesday at Cranwell.

(Ben Garver — The Berkshire Eagle) \nWiseman and Bator are making return trips to the state final on Monday. Buffoni is going for the first time. Bator was a sophomore on Drury's 2013 Western Mass. championship team, led by All-Eagle MVP Matt Lawrence. Now playing as a senior, it's Bator who's leading his younger teammates, the way Lawrence did before him. \n\"He's done a great job and he's really a role model for the younger guys, and an inspiration for them,\" Drury coach Don Dagnoli said. \nDagnoli added that Bator's cautious approach allowed him to navigate the narrow fairways on the back nine. He used irons off the tee, giving him the accuracy needed to shoot a low score. \nBator also played a practice round on the back nine, after only playing the front nine during home matches against Lenox. \nBuffoni did not play the back nine before the tournament, and after his round, he did not feel like he played well enough to advance to the state final. \nMonument coach Rick Iemolini said Buffoni's smarts allowed him to squeak in as the sixth qualifier. He said if Buffoni puts a solid round together at Crumpin Fox, he expects him to be among the top finishers in the state. \n\"He feels like he could've played a lot better, fortunately it was good enough,\" Iemolini said. \"He hits the ball every straight and keeps it in play. ... He's smart player that knows how to play golf. If he plays his game, he'll be just fine.\" \n——— TEAM RESULTS: 1. Cathedral 331, 2.
