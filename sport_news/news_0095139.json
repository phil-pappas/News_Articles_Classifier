Senior squad members Andy Hayward, Phil Burrows and Shea McAleese made themselves unavailable due to European club commitments. Selectors will name a 2016 Black Sticks national and development squad in December. \nBlack Sticks men's squad: Ad Feedback \nGoalkeepers: Devon Manchester (Auckland), Kyle Pontifex (Capital) \nDefenders: Nick Haig, Bradley Shaw (Canterbury), Arun Panchia, Dwayne Rowsell (Auckland), Blair Tarrant, Kane Russell (Southern), Alex Shaw (Capital) \nMidfielders: Ryan Archibald (Auckland), George Muir, James Coughlan (North Harbour), Nick Ross (Southern), Nic Woods (Midlands) \nAttackers: Simon Child, Marcus Child, Jared Panchia (Auckland), Nick Wilson (Central), Steve Edwards (North Harbour), Hugo Inglis (Southern), Stephen Jenness, Blair Hilton (Capital), Matt Rees-Gibbs (Midlands). - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:26:47.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
