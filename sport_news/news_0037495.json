A tougher opponent in the California Golden Bears comes into Austin on Saturday. Here are five things Texas fans should know about California.\n1. Jared Goff is 'the real deal'\nCalifornia's Jared Goff will be the first true spread quarterback Texas will face this season. So far, the Longhorns have seen two mobile dual-threat quarterbacks in Notre Dame's Malik Zaire and Rice's Driphus Jackson.\nGoff is used in Golden Bears' head coach Sunny Dykes' spread offense. This season Goff has recorded 630 passing yards, six touchdowns and two interceptions.\nTexas defensive coordinator Vance Bedford said Goff reminds him of former California quarterback and current Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers.\n\"(Goff) is the real deal,\" Bedford said. \"He can make throws into tight windows. He can go through his entire progression - first, second and come to his third guy. Most college quarterbacks can't do that. This guy is exceptional.\"\n2. Offensive weapons\nCalifornia has plenty of playmakers on its offense. With their use of the spread offense, the Golden Bears have a slew of wide receivers capable of making big plays.\nSenior wide receiver Trevor Davis caught a career-high 138 yards against San Diego State last week. He's amassed 170 receiving yards and one touchdown in two games. Kenny Lawler leads California in receiving touchdowns with three. He also has 107 receiving yards in 2015.\nIn the running game, senior running back Daniel Lasco leads the team in rushing with 137 yards and two touchdowns. He's caught one pass for 20 yards.\n3. Golden Bears' offensive line\nBedford said he sees an All-American offensive line in California's line through two games.\n\"Their offensive line - they're big, they're physical, they're athletic - there are things they do that makes these guys look like All-Americans,\" Bedford said. \"I look at the first two ball games, they knocked guys off the ball. The back's finding holes. Right now, I don't see any holes in Cal's offense.\"\nThe Golden Bears' offensive line's average height and average weight is 6-foot-5, 299 pounds. The Longhorns' defensive line has struggled to provide a pass rush. If Texas can't get past California's offensive line, it'll be a long game for the Longhorns.\n4. California's improved defense\nAlthough the Golden Bears have only played two games, its defense appears to be improved.\nCalifornia's defense finished the 2014 season at No. 121 in total defense giving up an average 511.8 yards per game.\nIn its first two games, the Golden Bears rank No. 43 in total defense and have only given up 311 yards per game.\nAlthough California has played Grambling State and San Diego State, the Golden Bears defense has shown improvement.\n5. Special teams' struggles\nCalifornia's special teams struggled against San Diego State.\nThe Golden Bears had to burn two timeouts when they were trying to setup their special teams unit. They were also penalized for kick-catch interference.\nDuring its first two games, California has only had four punt returns for 11 yards and they've only returned three kicks for 50 yards.\nThe Golden Bears can't afford a bad game against Texas as its special team helped them in its win over Rice.\nOn Twitter:\n @Nick_Castillo74", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Nick_Castillo74"], "published": "2015-09-17T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:20:17.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
