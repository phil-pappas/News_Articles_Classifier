We’re still friends.”\nIn that the Nets leader is also a bright and pragmatic man, he is not about to sweat the circumstances that caused his club to come out on the shorter-than-expected end of its blockbuster trade with the Celtics in the summer of 2013. As the teams did preseason battle last night, the Celts still have in their pocket a treasure trove of Brooklyn bling, while the Nets are also now in reconstruction.\nBut one year after its move from New Jersey to Brooklyn and coming off a 49-win season, the Nets took their shot. King and owner Mikhail Prokhorov believed that veteran help could make them title contenders. With Deron Williams, Joe Johnson and Brook Lopez already on board, they went for Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Jason Terry (and D.J. White), and gave up Gerald Wallace, Kris Humphries, MarShon Brooks, Keith Bogans, Kris Joseph and, most importantly, unprotected first-round draft picks in 2014 (James Young was chosen), 2016 and 2018, as well as the right for the Celts to swap first-round position in 2017.\n“We all made the decision to go for it,” King said. “We made a decision, and at that point we felt it was the best decision. And now we’re headed in a different direction. I don’t think you can sit there and say, ‘What if?’ You make a decision and you move on. That’s how we did it. You make the decision, and then you adjust and you move on as you have to.”\nThe Nets didn’t get what they wanted. Injuries were a major problem (Lopez played just 17 games) as they slipped to 44 wins and a second-round playoff sayonara at the hands of the Heat.\n“If we hadn’t had injuries, could we have won more? Possibly,” said King. “And then the picks (that went to the Celtics) . . . you know, I look at it like, there’s nothing that can be done about them. So now we’re focusing on trying to gain younger assets, as we did this year. And we’ll keep doing that. It’s something similar to what I did in Philadelphia, where we gave up a lot of picks early to get to The Finals. Then after that we started retooling and drafting second-round picks like Kyle Korver. You’ve just got to take what you have and work with it.”\nPierce left the Nets as a free agent after one season, and Garnett was traded last year in the midst of a 38-win campaign. Williams was bought out in July.\nThe value of the picks owed to the Celts would seem to have grown.\n“I think you look at it, but I don’t dwell on it because you can’t,” King said. “I mean, I’ve got to focus on what we have to do right now. I’m looking at it like, OK, how do we get Chris McCullough ready for next season? If we don’t have a first(-round pick), how do we get a second? How do we get another first? And we have $39 million in cap space. What are we going to do with it this summer?\n“So there are other things we have to think about. We could have no cap space and have all our picks, and I’d probably be thinking, geez, I wish I could get in the free agent market. So there’s always something that you have to deal with. We’re preparing for the draft like we always have. Guys are out there scouting everybody, because you never know. We may trade for a pick. We may buy a pick. But it’s true; we don’t have to worry about where our pick ends up being.\n“Everybody has their own situation they have to deal with and go through. I think we’ve just had to switch gears from where we were two years ago.”\nAnd while all the players received from the Celtics have moved on, King still believes that benefits linger.\n“What they brought in culture and character, with Paul for one year and KG for a year and three quarters, is something that will help this franchise down the road for a long time,” he said.\nThe Celtics, too, are thankful to Pierce and Garnett for what they brought to the organization even beyond the 2007-08 championship. Alas, for the Nets, part of the stars’ gift is in the form of draft picks still to come.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:28:01.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
