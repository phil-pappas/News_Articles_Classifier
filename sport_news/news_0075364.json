It happened Wednesday as workers were cleaning and doing maintenance on the sewer system in the area.\nThe Democrat Herald reports that workers dislodged plugs in old sewer lines that drain into the river, releasing sewage for about two to three hours.\nCity wastewater superintendent Kristin Preston said crews immediately plugged the old lines to prevent more sewage from spilling. Signs have been posted to warn the public of potential hazards of coming in contact with the water.\nThe city says bacteria that may have entered the river should be flushed out of the area within a few days.\n-- The Associated Press", "external_links": ["http://goo.gl/B5ujWR"], "published": "2015-10-18T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:03:58.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
