Skurzewski , News-Herald Media 10:06 p.m. CDT October 23, 2015 Collegiate Football on the Field (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe opening night of the high school playoff football saw an overwhelming theme: redemption. \nOne team that capitalized on that chance was Mosinee. Mosinee’s head coach Paul Nievinski is retiring following this season, but he will be coaching at least one more week. Mosinee lost to Antigo 34-30 in the regular season, but in a Level 1 playoff matchup, Mosinee’s defense shut out the Red Robins this time in a 21-0 Division 3 victory. \nAnother team exacting some revenge was the Athens Bluejays. Athens was embarrassed by Assumption in the regular season, suffering a 32-6 drubbing at the hands of the Royals. But in a Division 7 Level 1 playoff game, Athens stunned Assumption 17-14 on a game-winning 19-yard field goal by Austin Engel with 90 seconds remaining. \nMedford also exacted some payback. The co-Great Northern Conference champions — with Antigo — atoned for a 19-12 regular season loss to Merrill with a dramatic 29-27 victory. Ben Meier played the role of hero with a game-winning 22-yard field goal with no time left after completing a pass to the 5 yard line with just two seconds left and spiked the ball with one second left. Conrad Bolz racked up 240 rushing yards and three touchdowns on the ground. \nMedford will play Mosinee next week, as both teams will face a conference foe for the second straight week. In the regular season, Medford defeated Mosinee 44-35, but as we saw tonight that doesn’t mean a whole lot. \nTomahawk got a nice victory in Division 4 with a 19-0 shutout of Black River Falls in Tomahawk’s first playoff game since 2007. Kaleb Kaminski scored from 19 yards out in the second quarter for the game’s first score and it’s all Tomahawk would need. \nAbbotsford survived a test from Mondovi 30-28 in Division 6 action, as the Buffalo recovered three onside kicks to nearly pull off the upset. The Falcons will face Unity in a Level 2 game next week. \nLooking ahead to next week a game that jumps out is Edgar vs. Marathon, Part II. Marathon defeated Edgar for the first time since 1994 late in the regular season, 16-8. Marathon made quick work of Crandon 41-0, while Edgar disposed of Northern Elite 22-0 in Division 6 Level 1 play. Expect a hard-hitting, smash mouth game between two teams separated by about seven miles and who aren’t too fond of each other. \nMitchell A.
