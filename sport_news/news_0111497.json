Gionta, who was retaliating for a high cross-check from Borowiecki, received a five-minute major and a game misconduct. \n\"You saw the replay and that can’t happen,\" Gionta said. \"First, I apologize to Mark for that play. Obviously, I let my teammates down with it and, luckily, they bailed me out.\" \nThe Senators scored once during Gionta’s penalty to take a 3-2 lead and eventually went up 4-2 before the Devils rallied. For that, Gionta was thankful, but offered no excuses. \n\"I just lost my cool and that can’t happen,\" he said. \nAs of late Thursday, there was no official word from the NHL’s Department of Player Safety, but it appeared likely that Gionta would at least have a hearing. \nMerrill waits \nDevils coach John Hynes decided not to make any changes to a defense that helped produce OT wins in the team’s previous two games, so Jon Merrill sat for the third consecutive game. Merrill came down with a stomach bug prior to Sunday’s 2-1 win over the Rangers and also missed Tuesday’s 3-2 win over Arizona. He’s healthy now, but will have to wait for his chance. \n\"The team is playing well,\" Merrill said. \"You always like to be a part of the success, but, hopefully, [we] can just keep winning.\" \nNo extras \nWith LW Reid Boucher being sent down to Albany on Wednesday and RW Tuomo Ruutu home nursing a bruised right foot, the Devils have no extra forwards with them on this trip, which concludes Saturday in Buffalo. \n— Tom Gulitti © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:59:22.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
