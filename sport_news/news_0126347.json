Mayweather says he’s retiring, though Pacquiao recognizes that in boxing, those vows don’t always hold up. \n“If you ask me, of course, I want a rematch,’’ Pacquiao said. “I heard that he retired already. If he really retired, then there’s no rematch. But if not…’’ \nPacquiao injured his shoulder three weeks before the fight. He later said he aggravated it in the fourth round, when he landed some of his best punches of the night against Mayweather. \n“He kept moving around and didn’t want to fight toe to toe with me, exchanging punches,’’ Pacquiao said Monday. \nAsked if he could change that in a rematch, Pacquiao said, “I think so, especially (after) I fixed my shoulder.’’ \nPacquiao, a congressman in the Philippines, was in Manhattan to be honored with the Asia Society’s Asia Game Changer of the Year Award. \nHe is running for the Philippines’ 24-seat Senate, a national position that has been used as a springboard for vice president or president.
