Caitlin McPartland (10th), Megan Brockmeier (13th), Emily Bermudez (19th), Jill Neggia (20th) and Julia Scherer (21st) completed the scoring. \nBergen Catholic was fourth in the Boys B (Robin Hood) division led by Caleb Shaia, 13th in 17:14.4. \nDon Bosco was 10th for the second straight year in the Boys Eastern States race at the Manhattan Invitational at Van Cortlandt Park, led by David Rosas in 25th in 12:44.8 over the 2 1/2 mile course. Will and Colin Daly of River Dell finished closely behind in 26th (12:45.5) and 27th (12:46.8) on the classic course. Marc Lugo of Hackensack was 12th in the Boys E race in 13:19.0, while Michelle Kubasek of Bergen Tech was 20th in Girls F. \nLocally, Rhiannon Novelli of Holy Angels scored an impressive victory at the Garret Invitational at Garret Mountain in Woodland Park, defeating Jennifer Polo of Cliffside Park by more than 150 yards in the Girls Varsity A race in 19:55, a huge personal best at the site of next week’s Big North Meets. \nNovelli’s win helped the Angels, slowly getting healthy, to a 37-62 win over Union City in the team scoring. \n\"[The injuries to my teammates] push me to try and do better and help us get better as a team,\" said Novelli, a sophomore from Waldwick. \"I didn’t think I had a sub-20-minute race today because I didn’t think I was running that hard but after this I think I have a lot more in the tank.\" \nMahwah enjoyed a sensational day at the meet, sweeping both B team titles and getting first ever varsity wins by juniors Valerie Ervin and James Nagotko. \n\"I was surprised that I was able to win,\" said Ervin, whose 21:58 clocking at Garret was her personal best on the course by nearly half a minute. \"But the coach had showed me that no one in my race had a faster time than me, so I knew it could happen. But when I took the lead it was a little tough, because there was no one else to help me stay in the lead.\" \nNagotko was pleased with his 17:37 clocking and his win, although he kept turning back as he approached the finish line, almost stunned that no one had passed him. \n\"It’s a great tune-up for the [Patriot] league meet on Friday,\" Nagotko said. \"This is the fastest race I’ve ever run anywhere.\" \nRidgewood, resting its top eight runners, still managed to win Boys Varsity A, 51-53, over Memorial. \nRamapo won the Varsity Small School girls title at the Greystone Invitational at Central Park in Parsippany on Friday, defeating Wallkill Valley, 56-69, with Lakeland fifth. Lexi Harris led Ramapo in second (19:56.7) while Alyssa Gilligan was sixth (21:14.6), and Elizabeth Wilson 11th in 22:07.4. Linnea Gilligan and Sam Biss were fifth and eighth, respectively. for Lakeland. \nPassaic Tech finished fifth in the Large School girls meet as Sarah Shannon was eighth in 19:48.2. \nOn the boys side, Andy Biss of Lakeland was ninth in the Small School race in 17:37.4 while Alejandro Ibarguen of PCT was third in the Large School race in 16:50.9. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:21:41.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
