Sloma, Allred victorious again: Mohave’s Fricke places second for girls, Chavarria sixth for boys By DANIEL McKILLOP The Daily News MohaveDailyNews.com | 0 comments \nBULLHEAD CITY — Adrianna Sloma and Brendon Allred continued to dominate their Arizona Interscholastic Association Division III, Section II cross country foes, which was comprised of seven high schools during the Ray Gomez Invitational at Mohave High School on Wednesday. \nLake Havasu’s Sloma won the girls competition on the 3.1-mile course in a time of 19 minutes, 44.93 seconds, and Lee Williams’ Allred topped the boys at 17.00 minutes, as both runners remain unbeaten during the five races that have taken place in Kingman, Mohave Valley and Bullhead City this season. \n“I’m really proud of myself,” Sloma said. “It was my best time; I finally broke 20.” \nHavasu head coach Erika Washington was very emotional after her top runner crossed the finish line. \n“Oh my God,” Lake Havasu head coach Erika Washington said. “She had an incredible race. \n“I’m incredibly proud of her. \n“It was the perfect time for this kind of race with sectionals coming up. \n“It was a good confidence booster.” \nMohave Lady T-birds runner Kristina Fricke placed second at 22:03.07. \n“I think I did good,” Fricke said. “(Sloma) is fast; she’s good. I don’t think I was ahead of her.” \nT-birds head coach Jesse Oviatt said Fricke is picking up speed little by little. \n“The girls are doing fine,” said Oviatt about his Lady T-birds. “I’m blessed that I have Kristina, and the other girls are drawing closer to her. \n“They’re picking up speed; they’re all underclassmen.” \nLaughlin Lady Cougars’ Carissa Wollerton came in eighth place at 23:35.85. \n“I felt good about it,” Wollerton said. “It was easier; it was a flat course.” \nCougars head coach Mitch Mulcahy said Wollerton missed medaling by one place. “She should make it to state individually,” he added. \nLaughlin competes in the Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association Division III. \nRiver Valley Lady Dust Devils runner Tianna Williams was her team’s lone girl runner, and her head coach, Brent Wheaton, said Williams knocked a few seconds off her time. \nWilliams placed 13th at 24:83.40. \n“I ran my personal best,” Williams said. “It was my favorite course, it felt shorter than usual. The course was flat.” \nAllred said he ran the Mohave course at 16:19 last season, and Lee Williams Volunteers head coach Joan Abraham said her top boys runner was “not bad.” \n“I’m pretty happy,” she added. “He’s getting there.” \nThe results were unofficial, but it looked like the Lee Williams boys won the team event as did the Havasu girls. \nThe overall team scores were official, and the Volunteers topped the field with 24 points. \nMohave placed second at 65, Havasu third at 77, Kingman fourth at 78, Laughlin fifth at 95, Kingman Academy sixth at 192 and River Valley seventh at 210. \nAbraham said Allred ran really well, as did her boys. \n“I think my boys team is ready for section,” Abraham said. \nAllred said the Mohave course was faster than the other courses that he has ran on this season. \n“It has a couple of uphills, downhills (and) no sand issues. \n“I ran faster at the Casa Grande meet.” \nLaughlin Cougars Jonathan Johnson placed fourth. \n“This was a fast race,” Johnson said. “It was nice, flat and smooth all the way through. \n“When I got close to the finish line on the track, the announcer motivated me to finish.” \nJohnson added: “Every one on the team performed very well today. \n“We had a lot of personal bests. \n“This is motivating us for regionals next week.” \nThe Cougars will be competing at their regional meet at Veterans Memorial Park in Boulder City, Nev., on Oct. 30. \nMulcahy said his Cougar boys have been working to get their times in the 19s all year, and today they did that. \n“Johnathan was shooting for 17,” Mulcahy said, “and he did it. \n“This will help us build our confidence; the boys have a chance to make it to state if they run as well as they did today.” \nMohave T-birds runner Jose Chavarria placed sixth. \n“It was fun,” Chavarria said. “My shoe untied after one third of a mile. \n“It was a fast and fun course.” \nOviatt said Chavarria is picking up speed. \n“He figured it out,” said Oviatt about Chavarria. “His calorie count was off. \n“He wasn’t eating enough.” \nOviatt said his boys are moving better. \n“For most of them they’re inexperienced,” he added. “I’m expecting their times to improve a lot in the upcoming years.” \nDust Devils runner Justin Studer was the first River Valley boys runner to cross the finish line. \nStuder said his time was 20:45. \n“It was really fast like everybody said,” said Studer about the course. “The wind was pretty bad; we always had to find someone to draft behind.” \nWheaton said his Dust Devils ran some really good times overall. “All of them run a PR,” he added. “So they did really well.” \nThe boys times, the boys and girls team results were unable at deadline.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T10:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:11:00.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
