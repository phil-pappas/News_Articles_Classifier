We tried to do some things. But make no mistake: we're trying to get it fixed. And I'm trying to get it fixed.\n\"I talked to a bunch to some of the veteran coaches on the staff. I've talked to some coaches around the league. I've put calls into the league itself. So we're trying to do things. I'm not going to share with some of the things we're going to do physically and everything else until I have a chance to address my team.\"\nRyan clearly knows something has to change. He said the Bills have to start walking away from certain situations and hold themselves accountable for the infractions they are committing.\nHere are some other takeaways from Ryan's presser.\n1. Stats with Rex While Ryan started to own up to some of the penalty issues the Bills are having, he still isn't convinced the stats themselves tell the whole story.\n\"A stat that might be interesting is the most penalized team was (the) Seattle Seahawks a couple years in a row,\" Ryan said. \"I remember looking at that, and they won a Super Bowl and went to a championship. So sometimes penalties themselves don't tell the whole story, but sometimes they do.\n\"And when you look at this one here, clearly some of the unsportsmanlike penalties and all that, No. 1 we have to clean up. There is no question about that. That can't happen. Is that an issue, is that something that we get reputation-wise? It's something certainly to look at.\"\n2. Jerry Hughes has to settle down Bills star defensive end Jerry Hughes got two personal foul penalties against the Giants bringing his season total to four, and Ryan knows Hughes is one of a few players who has to play smarter.\n\"That's something that can't happen,\" Ryan said. \"You can't let a play — for instance, and not just Jerry, but anybody — maybe there's a hypothetical, you think you're getting held or tackled or something like that. And they don't give a flag, and you can't now step over the line and do something yourself. That doesn't work in this league. Vigilante, we don't need that.\n\"And Jerry is a great football player. But if there's a negative about Jerry, we got to get that curtailed. He doesn't need to get a personal foul penalty. He's too good a player.\"\n3. Nothing imminent with Carpenter Rex Ryan has been critical of kicker Dan Carpenter as recently as the end of the preseason, but he didn't seem too upset about the veteran missing a 30-yard field goal Sunday. Not upset enough to cut him, anyway.\n\"What I said was Dan's a pro,\" Ryan said. \"Dan knows you have to make a 30-yard field goal. He also made a 51-yarder. We'll see how it goes. I know nobody feels worse than he does. He's competitive. He wants it in the worst way to make kicks, but for some reason he's had a couple misses.\"\n4. Rex doesn't mind the quick throws In each of the Bills' two losses, the opponent's offense has utilized quick throws to negate Buffalo's pass rush. This is an approach that Ryan doesn't mind for a few different reasons, No. 1 being that the Giants went 3-for-15 on third down Sunday. He thinks teams are limiting their offensive playbook by getting the ball out so quickly.\n5. Injury updates Ryan said he had \"no idea\" on the outlook for wide receiver Sammy Watkins and running back LeSean McCoy because it was too early in the week. He did, however, say that tight end MarQueis Gray may have suffered a broken forearm. Safety Bacarri Rambo, meanwhile, suffered a quad injury, but Ryan didn't think it was severe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:16:27.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
