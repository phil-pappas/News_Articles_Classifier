Stephen Domingo finds opportunity with Cal basketball 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nTo learn more about Georgetown transfer Stephen Domingo , Cuonzo Martin called the man who had benched him. \nNo red flags arose. The Hoyas’ staff liked Domingo as a player, Georgetown coach John Thompson III told Martin in spring 2014, but depth along the wings didn’t afford the San Francisco native much of an opportunity. \nIt was all Cal’s coach needed to hear. Seventeen months removed from committing to the Bears, Domingo is settling in as a key cog of a Pac-12 contender. The two qualities that had once made him an elite recruit — relentless defense and a smooth jump shot — should soon surface in college games. \nGeorgetown “didn’t work out as well as he would’ve liked,” said Martin, whose Cal team opens its season Nov. 13 against Rice. “To his credit, it wasn’t a case of transferring home. He was transferring for an opportunity.” \nDomingo was the most highly touted prep prospect to come out of San Francisco in a decade. Over three years at St. Ignatius, he was twice named to The Chronicle’s All-Metro team. The four-star recruit received scholarship offers from more than half the Pac-12, including Cal, before choosing Georgetown. \nIn summer 2012, after his junior year of high school, he helped a U.S. under-17 team featuring several future NBA lottery picks win gold at the FIBA World Championships in Lithuania. Domingo then surprised many by enrolling with the Hoyas a year early. \nAs a 6-foot-6, 180-pound freshman, his learning curve was steep. Domingo struggled with his shot and fell out of the rotation by the start of conference play. After totaling 29 points in 39 appearances over two seasons, he was granted his release from Georgetown. \nMartin began recruiting Domingo shortly after Cal hired him in April 2014. For several years, he had tracked the swingman’s career from afar. Martin figured that, if he found the right situation, Domingo could start living up to his high school pedigree. \n“It was great that coach believed in me,” said Domingo, who picked the Bears over Gonzaga and Vanderbilt, among others. “A lot of people believed in me, and there was no doubt what I could still do on the court. I just had to come here and prove that.” \nWhile sitting out a season under NCAA transfer rules, Domingo committed himself to the weight room, added a layer of muscle and fine-tuned his shooting mechanics. Martin views him as a versatile piece, someone who can play shooting guard and both forward spots. \nDomingo has emerged as Cal’s best perimeter defender. In practices, he relishes matching up with top scorers Jaylen Brown and Tyrone Wallace . Domingo is competing with returners Jordan Mathews and Jabari Bird for a starting job. \n“He’s going to hustle, play hard,” said Wallace, Domingo’s roommate. “I think he’ll bring a lot to the team.” \nGrowing up in San Francisco, Domingo visited Cal a dozen or so times. So Martin hardly needed to sell him on the school during the recruiting process. Domingo just wanted to make sure the Bears provided a family-oriented environment where he could crack the rotation. \nConsider those two metaphorical boxes checked. \n“The opportunity to come to Cal was nice because it was closer to home,” Domingo said. “But it was really Coach Martin that brought me back. That was the guy I committed to, and I’m glad I made that decision.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:34:24.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
