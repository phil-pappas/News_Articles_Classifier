Jordan scored 12 points in the first half on 5-for-6 shooting, including three dunks. The Clippers spoiled Nuggets coach Michael Malone 's debut. Nuggets: Joffrey Lauvergne scored 16 points on 7-for-10 shooting and had 11 rebounds in a reserve role. Rookie Emmanuel Mudiay missed eight of his first 11 shots and finished with 14 points. Clippers: Josh Smith had 13 points and eight rebounds, Chris Paul added 12 points, nine assists and five rebounds in 23 minutes, and newcomer Paul Pierce started and scored five points in 15 minutes. Star watch: Paul made a 3-pointer as he was fouled in the third quarter. He missed the free throw, but Pierce followed with a 3-pointer. Midseason form: Jordan had an airball on a third-quarter free throw. A 42-percent shooter from the line in his career, he finished 3 of 5. Up next: The Clippers will play Toronto in Vancouver, British Columbia, on Sunday. Denver is at Dallas on Tuesday night.
