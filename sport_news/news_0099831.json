Last week in Norman, WVU trailed Oklahoma 24-7 at the break. Saturday night in Morgantown, the deficit was 17-2 against Oklahoma State. While West Virginia's entire offense struggled in both opening halves, Skyler Howard has completed just 11 of 27 passes for 112 yards with two turnovers. After turning the ball over five times against Oklahoma, WVU gave it away four times against the Cowboys. Three of those were fumbles, one each against the ledgers of Howard, Wendell Smallwood and Rushel Shell. Depsite being shutout in the first half, West Virginia found their rhythm offensively in he second half, scoring 24 points to force overtime. In the extra session, West Virginia's defense had one chance to essentially secure the game. On the opening possession of overtime, OSU faced 4th and 1 at the 2-yard line. J.W. Walsh replaced Mason Rudolph for this play and scored up the middle. A West Virginia defense that forced there turnovers and kept the Mountaineers in the game could not get off the field after the Cowboys ran the ball for all six of their plays in overtime. West Virginia needed a touchdown to extend the game. After converting on a 4th and 2, WVU was later faced with third and goal at the four. A loss of seven and an incompletion were the last two plays of the ball game. Smallwood rushed for 147 yards at 7.7 yards per tote but in the extra frame, Shell, not Smallwood, was in the backfield.
