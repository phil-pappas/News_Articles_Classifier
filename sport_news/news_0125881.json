For Arkansas head coach Bret Bielema, a victory represents a chance to start 1-0 in conference play despite a rough start to 2015, as well avoid hot seat rumors in his third year with the program. As for A&M, Myles Garrett and company will be working to put pressure on an Arkansas offensive line yet to allow a QB sack this season.\nA win for the Aggies could push the program to top 10 in the AP and put them in great shape in regards to the SEC West. Once considered to be a potential playoff dark horse by some, the Razorbacks may be in jeopardy of missing out on bowl season entirely if they do not right the ship soon.\nWhen A&M has the ball\nThe Aggies have a victory over a non-conference ranked opponent to begin the season followed by handling business two consecutive weeks at home to start things off 3-0. Arkansas is off to a 1-2 start in 2015 and appears to be trending down rather than up. This has all the makings of a trap game for the favored A&M squad.\nThe offense must limit turnovers. Though victories, the Aggies have allowed teams to hang around in games due to frequently coughing up the rock or tossing interceptions. Ball State and Nevada may have seem outmatched, but an Arkansas team with its back to the wall will certainly take advantage of every opportunity provided. A&M needs to strike early and often, as a tie game late may not play well in its favor.\nWhen Arkansas has the ball\nThe key to victory for the Razorbacks on Saturday will be up the middle, and winning the battle in the trenches represents a 1-0 start in SEC play.\nThe Razorbacks offensive line is the largest in the country, college or professional, and they have used that size to prevent QB Brandon Allen from being sacked all season. 10 different receivers have caught a pass for the Razorbacks this season, a testament to how much time the senior QB is being allowed in the pocket to go through progressions.\nLeading the way with 14 receptions is tight end Hunter Henry. The preseason All-American has 191 receiving yards and a TD thus far in 2015. Expect running back Alex Collins to have a busy day as well looking for holes in the A&M defense.\nPrediction\nArkansas has its back against the wall and will give its best effort on Saturday to avoid starting the season 1-3 and begin digging a hole to deep to climb out. Expect the Razorbacks to try and win this game on pure strength and determination up the middle of the field, focusing on the linebackers and secondary.\nThe game plays close for the first 30 minutes of play before the Aggies take control in the second half. The sack-less streak comes to an end for the Arkansas offensize line as Garrett, Daeshon Hall, and the rest of the A&M defensive line brings pressure all evening long.\nScore: Texas A&M 41, Arkansas 24\nOn Twitter:\n @BrandonWheeland", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/BrandonWheeland"], "published": "2015-09-24T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:55:51.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
