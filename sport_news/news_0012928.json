She broke the Duke record for lowest average score, and this summer, Maguire moved up to first in the world rankings. She’s the top-ranked amateur player in the world. \n“It’s always nice to see yourself up there in rankings,\" Maguire said. \"You know you’re definitely going in the right direction, and you’re where you need to be.” \nBut as good as the sophomore from Ireland has been on the course, she’s often hard to spot. That's because Leona’s twin sister, Lisa, also plays for Duke. \n“We’re always tying to beat each other,\" Leona said. \"I guess from a very young age we’ve always had that little bit of competitive streak in us.” \n“We push each other, we want each other to do better,\" said Lisa. \"It just constantly helps us to improve.” \nYou might say the Maguire sisters were destined for big things in golf. At the age of 10, Leona and Lisa were picked out of all the kids in Ireland to bring the Ryder Cup to the presentation stage when the Cup was held in Dublin in 2006. \n“It was the first time a big, big championship like that had been held in Ireland,\" Leona said. \"We were just excited to be getting to go to the Ryder Cup.” \n“It kind of hit home when Tiger (Woods) walked into the tent,\" Lisa said. \"We were just kind of awestruck and just kind of going over to him to get a picture taken.” \n“To get to bring up one of the biggest trophies in golf on a stage like that, it was pretty cool,” Leona said. \nNow, they’re winning their own trophies at Duke.
