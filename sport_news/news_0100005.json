It’s just that they have their own way to do it. \nAnd lo, the baseballs were smote. \nThe Toronto onslaught actually started off in decidedly Royals-esque fashion. With Kansas City jumping out to a quick 1-0 lead on a leadoff triple from Alcides Escobar and a ground-ball out, the Jays put two runners on in the second inning with a Troy Tulowitzki single and Russell Martin hit-by-pitch. With two out, Ryan Goins — who was hitting .087 in the playoffs and misplayed a key pop-up in Game 2 — worked an 0-2 count into a nine-pitch at-bat before lacing a single that scored both runners. It was a plate appearance K.C. manager Ned Yost could love: long, cagey and effective. \nToronto brought the serious lumber in the following inning. With Edwin Encarnacion and Chris Colabello on base and none out, Tulowitzki rocketed a Johnny Cueto pitch over the centre-field fence to give the Blue Jays a 6-2 lead. After a Kevin Pillar RBI double, Josh Donaldson roped a two-run home run into the second deck in left field. Cueto, who had been brilliant in shutting down the Houston Astros in the deciding Game 5 of their AL Division Series, didn’t get out of the third inning and gave up eight runs. He laughed and smiled and casually tossed aside a big wad of gum when he walked to the dugout as the Rogers Centre jeered him, which will no doubt anger many but might be the right attitude against the Toronto lineup. Sometimes laughing is required. \n“That’s really what we’re all about,” Gibbons said afterward. “We desperately needed that breakout.” \nThe Tulowitzki blow looms particularly large. After he hit a three-run shot in Game 3 against Texas, Gibbons had mused that the five-time All-Star was starting to show signs of an offensive breakout that had eluded him since his mid-season arrival from Colorado. “If he catches fire, we’re real dangerous,” the manager said. \nWhen he hit the home run, Tulowitzki had four hits in his last six at bats, having gone 2-for-25 previously. That counts as getting hot. \n“In two must-win games, he’s hit the big home run,” Gibbons said. If Tulowitzki is going to hit bombs at the 30-homer pace he has reached in his healthiest seasons, it gives the Blue Jays four major power threats in their lineup. Three was trouble enough for many pitchers this season. \nMarcus Stroman, the 24-year-old Toronto starter with the shock of blonde hair and a dazzling array of pitches, was far from sharp on the night. He gave up four runs on 11 hits spread over 6.1 innings, which, on a lot of nights, would be trouble. \nBut when the Blue Jays hit like they can, it was more than enough.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:42:13.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
