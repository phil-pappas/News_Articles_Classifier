He also poses a huge challenge for the St. Louis Cardinals, who insist they will be ready for the first playoff game at Wrigley Field in seven years. \n\"We’ve gone up against a number of teams and a number of pitchers where everybody kind of ruled us out and said you can’t do this or that, and I think this team has responded well in the past,\" Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said. \nThe past includes two wins against Clayton Kershaw in last year’s playoffs, and a long history of postseason success. It also includes a victory over Arrieta in May, but that was long before he went on one of the most dominant runs baseball has ever seen. \nDating to a four-hit shutout against Minnesota on June 21, Arrieta is 17-1 with a microscopic 0.81 ERA in his last 21 starts. The stretch includes a no-hitter against the NL West champion Los Angeles Dodgers, and a five-hit shutout at Pittsburgh in the wild-card game last Wednesday. \n\"I’ve been through a lot in my career, and the failure that I’ve gone through makes me really appreciate the moments of success much more,\" said Arrieta, who seemed to be getting one last chance to stick when he was traded from Baltimore to Chicago in July 2013. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:26:50.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
