The panel has found all allegations against the headmaster true and suggested indepth investigation and action against him. The committee was formed by the CEO on October 7 after complaints of harassment were lodged by the female staff of Government High School, Gurdhan Bala, against the headmaster. The headmaster was also accused of other irregularities. The committee is headed by Sri Nagesh, head of the department at the District Institute of Education and Training, and assisted by Pushap Kumar, principal, and Khaliq Hussain, Zonal Education Planning Officer. On October 7, the staff, including seven female teachers, of Government High School, Gurdhan Bala, met Chowdhry Altaf Hussain, Rajouri CEO, and lodged a complaint against the headmaster, Arun Kumar. They had accused Kumar of harassing staff, using unparliamentary language with female staff and girl students, misappropriation of funds and other unlawful activities. On the complaint of the school staff, the CEO had attached the headmaster to Boys Higher Secondary School, Rajouri, and initiated an internal inquiry. “The inquiry committee submitted its interim report on Monday. The report indicates many irregularities committed by the headmaster such as using unparliamentary language while talking to the female staff and girl students. The report has been forwarded to the Director, School Education, and the Deputy Commissioner, Rajouri, for action,” said the CEO. “During the inquiry, the committee members found most of the complaints true,” said the CEO. According to the probe committee, the school headmaster had taken 51 leaves and 62 duties (official visits) from January to December 2013 and 68 leaves and 30 duties between January and December in 2014. Till September this year, the headmaster has taken 21 leaves and 30 duties. All leaves and duties were availed without sanction from competent authority. The interim report also highlighted that the headmaster was replacing the ‘punctuality register’ every month and added that variations were detected between the punctuality register and the staff attendance register in 2015 while the punctuality registers for the past years were missing from the school records. The committee did not find the service book of the headmaster in the school and in the CEO office. No leave was entered in his (headmaster’s) service record. The report added that despite 16% result of the school for Class X in the 2014-2015 session, the headmaster had withdrawn his increment without the sanction of the controlling officer in clear violation of the government order.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:03:27.532+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
