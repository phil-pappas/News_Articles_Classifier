In fact, the losing streak was shredding to pieces as the Aggies stormed over the Broncos with a massive 52-26 victory in Maverik Stadium Friday night.\nAs far as the stats go, the Aggies and the Broncos were relatively close — until you look at the turnovers. Utah State recorded eight turnovers in the victory, and according to head coach Matt Wells, that’s what made the difference.\nThere was only one thing Wells was upset with after the game: having to decide who deserved the game footballs. Wells described the game as “maybe the greatest win in this program’s history.”\nThe Aggies are in the Mountain West Conference Mountain Division driver’s seat.\n“It’s huge; I’ll make no bones about it. We’ve been saying it out of respect for Boise State, that the road to the Mountain West championship goes through them. Until someone knocks them off the throne, it’s theirs,” Wells said. “It isn’t the championship, but it puts us in the driver’s seat. We’ll control our own destiny and that will be a challenge. It’s a challenge our guys will gladly accept.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:35:15.324+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
