(Kevin Winter/Getty Images) \nIn the heart of the Georgetown University Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, beakers, binders and bottles line the walls of room E316, a BSL-2 laboratory. On a refrigerator, two labs coats hang, one for Devon Still, the former Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle, and one for DeMaurice Smith, executive director of the NFL Players Association. This is where Jeffrey Toretsky, a pediatric oncologist who conducts research on Ewing sarcoma, a form of bone cancer most often found in children, does his work. \nFriday, he was there to talk with Still and Smith about his research. They went through a quick lesson, learning about how to work with cancerous cells. They looked through microscopes and discussed strains, mutations and genetic fingerprinting. Still, whose daughter Leah was diagnosed with cancer in September 2014, has a solid working knowledge of the disease and the science behind it. \n“I try to take my down time and do as much research on cancer as possible and watch different documentaries to show how scientists research different cancers,” Still, 26, said Friday. ” It’s coming to places like this, it lets me know that going public with my daughter’s story is worth it, because we are able to raise the research dollars that these scientists need to continue to do their research to try to find a cure for different cancers.” \nWhen he went public, the country quickly became enamored with Leah’s story. The hashtag #LeahStrong grew in popularity as followers and fans began to show support for the 5-year-old, who was diagnosed with neuroblastoma. Now, with her cancer in remission, Devon is set to be honored by the center and the NFL Players Association at the 29th Annual Lombardi Gala Saturday in D.C. \nFor the fifth time, Smith will serve as honorary chair of the event. The award “was established to honor a leader in the sports industry whose life and family have been touched by cancer, and who encourages cancer research, prevention and treatment through awareness and philanthropy,” according to the NFLPA. Earlier this month, the New England Patriots honored Still with a tribute to his daughter during a Sunday Night Football game against the Bengals. \n“After his daughter’s diagnosis, Devon put aside his own fear and became a tireless advocate for the millions of other people battling cancer. By creating positivity out of adversity, he embodies the qualities of a true leader,” Dr. Louis M. Weiner, director of the cancer center, said in a release this week. “He is not only an incredible father and role model to Leah, but a shining example of the differences people can make when they use their voices to speak out for others.” \n— Oswego Womens Hockey (@OswegoStateWHKY) October 18, 2015 . @Dev_Still71 tell Leah thanks so much and to stay strong! #LeahStrong pic.twitter.com/asBqkhMlJA \n— Mark Strotman (@markstrot) October 20, 2015 \nWith Washington playing Tampa Bay at FedEx Field at 1 p.m. on Sunday and Baltimore traveling to Arizona for a Monday tilt, it is unlikely that any active players will be at the event. Former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who is a big supporter, will address the crowd at the Washington Hilton. \nAs for Devon, the whole experience has been humbling in more ways than one. He didn’t know what to expect when the news first came out. “It just shows how many good people are out there and willing to help. You know, you see a lot of things in the news that’s bad and you see a lot of things that divide people, but when I went public with my daughter’s story, you saw the whole country come together, because everybody’s touched by kids who really are not getting a fair chance at life and not getting a fair chance to experience childhood,” he said. “So, to see the NFL come together, and allow us to use that platform to continue to get my daughter’s story out there, so that more awareness is being raised, it meant a lot to us.” \nBefore they left Dr. Toretsky had a gift for Still. It was another lab coat, this one emblazoned with Leah’s name. Compared to her father’s, it was miniscule. Still instantly thought of a good use for it. \n“It might be a nice little Halloween costume,” he said with a smile. Clinton Yates is a D.C. native and an online columnist.
