The Cowboys have a bye this week.\nCollins will make his second career start against the New York Giants in Week 7 in place of Ronald Leary. He has played in two games and has not allowed a sack or quarterback pressure in 57 snaps. He replaced Leary, who sat out with an injured back, earlier in the season.\nCollins was an All-American who played from 2011-14 at LSU and signed with the Cowboys as an undrafted free agent . He was passed over in the NFL draft last April because of a murder investigation in which his former girlfriend and her unborn child were victims. Collins was never a suspect and was ultimately cleared in the investigation .\nLa'el Collins: \"[This is] definitely the start of showing I'm becoming the player I want to be. Just taking that approach every day.\"\n— Jon Machota (@jonmachota) October 14, 2015 La'el Collins is the new starter at left guard\n— Jon Machota (@jonmachota) October 14, 2015", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jonmachota/status/654384550588620800", "https://twitter.com/jonmachota/status/654327026304856064"], "published": "2015-10-14T23:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:29:28.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
