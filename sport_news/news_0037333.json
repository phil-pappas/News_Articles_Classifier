Edwards got highlighted by the New York Times and the Big Ten Network as among the day's best college football performers. \nBTN.com's Sean Merriman wrote : \"Another week, another outstanding individual performance from a Wisconsin linebacker. This week, it was Edwards who had a standout game for the Badgers. He recorded a career-high 16 tackles and forced a fumble in Wisconsin’s 24-7 win over Purdue.\" \n\"Any more games like the one Edwards had against visiting Purdue,\" the Times wrote , \"and the Badgers will have another reliable playmaker on an already dangerous defense.\" This guy has had a quite day! T.J. Edwards has a new career high with 16 tackles ?? http://t.co/0TOjCzrs9q via @Ba … pic.twitter.com/h6xzdnAhN6 \nWith running back Corey Clement cleared to play but again watching from the sidelines , Joel Stave became just the fifth Badgers quarterback in program history to have consecutive 300-yard passing games. Against Purdue, he was 30-for-39 for 322 yards despite a first-half interception deep in Boilermakers territory . Joel Stave is the first #Badgers QB in history with a 4-0 record against an opponent, beating Purdue for a 4th time. pic.twitter.com/nmd55fwUpi — Wisconsin Football (@BadgerFootball) October 17, 2015 \nHere are some of the reactions to the Badgers' victory: \n• From the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Jeff Potrykus : \"The drama ended midway through the fourth quarter — thanks largely to UW's defense and special teams — when freshman tailback Alec Ingold eluded three defenders for one of the more impressive 1-yard touchdown runs you'll see. UW's 24-7 victory over Purdue in front of 80,794 fans certainly wasn't awe-inspiring but it was important.\" \n• From ESPN.com 's Jesse Temple: \"By winning, Wisconsin has given itself an opportunity to stay alive in the Big Ten West race. However, it may be tough to catch Iowa, which still holds a tiebreaker by virtue of its 10-6 victory against Wisconsin two weeks ago. Wisconsin should get top running back Corey Clement back soon, which will help tremendously on offense.\" Wisconsin 10, Purdue 7 at halftime. More proof that these Badgers aren’t nearly the power they’ve been the past several seasons. — Brian Bennett (@BennettESPN) October 17, 2015 \n• From ESPN Wisconsin's Zach Heilprin : \"Winning by 17 points, like the University of Wisconsin football team did on Saturday, would make most programs in the country, along with their fans, satisfied. But the Badgers’ 24-7 victory over Purdue (1-6, 0-3 Big Ten) left many once again questioning an inconsistent offense, while at the same time praising another nearly brilliant effort by the defense.\" \n• From the Lafayette Courier & Journal's Mike Carmin : \"At halftime, the trimmed down offensive game plan produced 61 total yards. Now consider this: Safety Leroy Clark ran 66 yards on his interception return alone, setting up Purdue's only touchdown Saturday against Wisconsin at Camp Randall Stadium.\" \n• From BTN.com 's Tom Dienhart, who gave the Badgers a B grade for Saturday's game: \"These may not be the ground-pounding Badgers we have come to love, but play some serious defense and are still winning. A methodical 24-7 win vs. Purdue keeps Wisconsin in the West chase, as Joel Stave has passed for over 300 yards in consecutive games after UW had just 96 yards rushing (2.6 ypc) vs. Purdue.\" \nAnd here's the Big Ten Network roundup: Todd D.
