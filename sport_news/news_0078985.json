The cornerback, whose last-minute interception saved Super Bowl XLIX at the end of a rookie year in which he played sparingly, has made the step up and emerged as a constant in the team’s secondary this season. Part of that’s been out of necessity: starting cornerbacks Darrelle Revis (back in town with the New York Jets this Sunday) and Brandon Browner and slot corner Kyle Arrington all left the defending Super Bowl champions as free agents during the offseason. But part of that, Patriots head coach Bill Belichick said Monday, has been the result of the improvement the undrafted free agent out of West Alabama has displayed. “Malcolm’s a good football player and he’s played very well for us both last year and this year, but just given where we are in the secondary and the level of improvement, I think no matter who we had on our team that he would be playing a lot of football for us,” said Belichick. “So that’s really a credit to him and how much that he’s improved from last year to this year. “He’s a good football, he’s playing well, he does a lot of good things for us, and there’s still a lot of room for him to improve. I don’t think that he’s hit the peak, but he’s getting better, and I thought he played well (Sunday) night.” While far from flawless (wide receiver Donte Moncrief’s 5-yard touchdown reception from Andrew Luck at his expense put the Patriots in a quick 7-0 hole), Butler contributed eight tackles and two passes defensed to his team’s 34-27 win at Indianapolis. Butler, who made 14 tackles and broke up four passes on defense and was credited with one tackle on special teams while appearing in 11 games (one start) last season, entered Sunday night’s game with 16 tackles, two passes defensed and one interception. He has started every game at left cornerback for the Patriots this year. The polls are open: Pro Bowl balloting has begun and will continue through Dec. 15. Fans can vote online and on web-enabled mobile phones by going to NFL.com/probowl/ballot . Eighty-eight Pro Bowl players will be announced live on the NFL Network on Dec. 22. The game will be played on Jan. 31 at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu.

He’s going like 60: With his catch and run for a 25-yard touchdown in the third quarter of Sunday night’s win, Rob Gronkowski reached 60 touchdowns in his 70th regular-season game, the fewest number of games it’s taken a tight end to get to 60 in league history. San Diego’s Antonio Gates (60 in his 110th game) held the previous mark.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:51:37.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
