(AP) — Pharoh Cooper caught seven passes for 160 yards including South Carolina's only touchdown as the Gamecocks won interim coach Shawn Elliott's first game 19-10 over Vanderbilt on Saturday. \nFormer walk-on Perry Orth was 17-for-28 for 272 yards and Brandon Wilds ran 24 times for 119 yards as South Carolina (3-4, 1-4 Southeastern) won just its second league game since September 2014. \nThe Commodores (2-4, 0-3) turned it over five times as they lost their 11th straight SEC game. \nSkai Moore had an interception, a sack, recovered a fumble and led the Gamecocks with 11 tackles. \nVanderbilt led 10-6 and appeared to be in control when Orth hit Cooper on a 78-yard touchdown pass. South Carolina turned it over on its next two possessions, but mistakes kept the Commodores from getting back on track. \nElliott took over as coach Tuesday after Steve Spurrier resigned during his 11th season on the sidelines. \nElliott Fry made four field goals of 19, 22, 31 and 47 yards and missed two from 39 and 55 yards for South Carolina. \nDarrius Sims ran six times for 104 yards, while Johnny McCrary went 21-of-42 for 177 yards, a touchdown and three interceptions for the Commodores. \nFor the first time since 1999, South Carolina started a game without a coach who won a national championship on the sidelines after Steve Spurrier resigned Tuesday during his 11th season after he had taken over for Lou Holtz. Spurrier spent his Saturday at the Michigan State-Michigan game, hanging out with ESPN. \nThe Gamecocks turned to its offensive line coach to finish the season as head coach. \nThe team responded with its best offensive performance of the season, gaining 424 yards. And the defense, which came into the game last in the SEC, held Vanderbilt to 332 yards — 96 yards below the unit's average. \nBut there aren't a lot of easy games left on South Carolina's schedule. The Gamecocks play three teams — Texas A&M, Florida and Clemson — who all started Saturday in the top 10. They have to win one of those to be eligible for an eighth straight bowl game. \nSouth Carolina has trailed at half every game this season. The Gamecocks led for most of the first 30 minutes, but a 14-play, 79-yard drive that took up nearly half the second quarter ended with a 4-yard touchdown pass from McCrary to Caleb Scott that put Vanderbilt up 7-6 at the break. \nSouth Carolina failed to get a first down in its next possession, and Vanderbilt put together a 10-play drive, but the Gamecocks defense stopped the Commodores on third-and-2 from the 5, forcing a 23-yard field goal. \nCooper caught his touchdown pass three plays later. \nVanderbilt would turn it over four more times and South Carolina gave the ball away twice the rest of the way. \nSecond-year Vanderbilt coach Derek Mason has yet to win an SEC game after taking over for James Franklin who went 9-7 in the conference in his final two seasons with the Commodores.
