If that was the case, I'm absolutely sure he's going to make sure he improves on that and the next time he has the opportunity, he will be prepared.\"\nIf Thomas was timid, it wasn't reflected when he made an interception at the Seahawks' 1-yard line late in the first half. In truth, the defensive issues were more widespread and contained primarily to the fourth quarter, as Seattle allowed 17 unanswered points before losing 27-24 in overtime.\nA reporter asked Thomas, a four-time Pro Bowl selection and three-time, first-team All-Pro, what he meant by not being fully prepared.\n\"I feel like when you're prepared you're fully confident,\" he said. \"You can challenge everything. You're your best and you can really trust what you're doing out there.\"\nThomas added that he didn't know why he wasn't ready, then was tongue-in-cheek.\n\"Maybe I got up here talking about the seams and I probably got distracted about that last week so I got to watch what I say to y'all,\" he said.\nIt won't get much easier Sunday when the Carolina Panthers (4-0), led by quarterback Cam Newton, visit CenturyLink Field.\nAfter Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton laid waste to Seattle's secondary, going 30-for-44 for 331 yards, two touchdowns and the pick, the Legion of Boom looked more like the Legion of Blown Coverages. Communication issues in the secondary have been pegged as the problem. \n\"Well, there was nothing in particular that led to it, it just happened,\" Richard said. \"Again, those are critical errors out there in the game that we absolutely want to minimize, but nothing led to it.\"\nWhen Thomas returned his goal-line interception 68 yards, it should have set the Seahawks up for a potential touchdown before the end of the half. Instead, defensive lineman Michael Bennett was called for an unnecessary roughness penalty for repeatedly pummeling Dalton. \n\"I was in awe,\" Thomas said of Bennett's penalty. \"I was surprised. I wasn't mad at anybody. I was just in a daze.\"\nSeattle mounted a 76-yard drive that ended with kicker Steven Hauschka's 24-yard field goal, taking a 10-7 lead into the half. \n\"Of course you need to block, but Michael Bennett, he doesn't block,\" Thomas said of the return. \"If he does block, he goes straight for the quarterback. He did it yesterday in practice, so we got to get him out of that habit.\"\nThe Seahawks need to make a habit of forcing more turnovers. They have one interception this season, tied for 30th in the NFL with the Cleveland Browns and Jacksonville Jaguars. They've held fourth-quarter leads in each of their losses. \n\"It's disappointing more than it is concern(ing),\" Richard said when asked about surrendering late leads. \"Because we know the type of defense that we are. We just need to go out there and prove it. It's ultimately what it comes down to. When we put a complete game together, that's when we'll know we're going in the direction that we want to be.\"\nAdded Richard:\n\"It hasn't happened yet.\"\nB.J. Daniels back \nTwo days after being placed on waivers, wide receiver B.J. Daniels returned to the 53-man roster to replace fullback Derrick Coleman.\nColeman was suspended indefinitely Thursday by the Seahawks after being arrested for an alleged hit-and-run and vehicular assault that occurred in Bellevue on Wednesday night. \nDaniels, a converted quarterback, has played in two games for Seattle this season, notching one reception for 12 yards. \nInjury report \nRunning back Marshawn Lynch (hamstring) was a full participant in Thursday's practice and appears set to play Sunday. Lynch has missed the past two games after getting injured against the Chicago Bears. \nThe Seahawks who didn't participate in Thursday's practice were defensive tackle Jordan Hill (quadriceps), cornerback Tye Smith (hip), linebacker Bobby Wagner (pectoral), defensive end Frank Clark (hamstring), defensive lineman Michael Bennett (non-injury) and linebacker Nick Moody (ankle).\nCornerback Marcus Burley (thumb) also sat out and has been ruled out for Sunday.\nDefensive tackle Demarcus Dobbs (shoulder) and linebacker Brock Coyle (knee) were limited, while linebacker Kevin Pierre-Louis (hamstring) was a full participant.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:55:28.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
