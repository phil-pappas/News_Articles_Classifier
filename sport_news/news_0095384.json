As human as he is, I don’t think he meant evil by going public. For me I think he did that out of the insatiable love he has for club. Don’t forget he is still a board member.” \n“Painting Kuffuor black will create enmity between him and Opoku Nti, who is still in office. We should rather concentrate on how to build a formidable side for the future.” \n“I believe the highly respected king, Otumfuo in his own wisdom, will choose somebody who will take the club to higher heights. He has done it before, and I believe he would make us all happy by bringing somebody after his own heart to turn the fortunes of the club.” \n“Let’s remain united and stop pointing accusing fingers at one management member or the other,” the former Kotoko director advised. \nThe president of Kenpong Group of Companies is known to have served and supported the club’s previous administrators till date. \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
