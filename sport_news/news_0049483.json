He’s ridden a faultless season and will be a worthy champion.” Kalex rider Zarco leads Rabat in the championship by 78 points with a total of 75 still to be won in the three races after Japan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:51:49.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
