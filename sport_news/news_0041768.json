(Associated Press) Comments \nFriends have suggested I write about the Chicago Cubs, who take on the St. Louis Cardinals Friday night in their quest to end a 107-year World Series title drought. \nWhen Cubs teams have flirted with success in the past, I have chosen to wait until they reached the World Series. But they haven't made it that far since 1945, let alone won it, so such delay tactics are done at a writer's own peril. \nBut this is the year. We're sure of it, we Cub fans who wonder why the law of averages has ignored us. As a Cub player once said, one of these centuries has to be ours. \nThis is Red Sox country with a hefty dose of Yankees interest, and beyond the fact that its battery of Jon Lester and David Ross will face John Lackey and the Cardinals in Division Series Game 1, there is a local connection to justify my narrative. The Cubs have nothing in common with the Yankees, a conglomerate Groucho Marx once likened to rooting for U.S. Steel. \nBut the Cubs and Red Sox are second cousins, according to how Red Sox fans often describe it. It is not viewed in quite that way in Illinois, where I lived from 1959 to 1964 and where my passion for America's Real Team made its indelible imprint on my psyche. \nOurs was a baseball town, and my friends in Rantoul, Ill., chose either the Cardinals or the Cubs. (Sorry, White Sox fans.) In a fateful decision, I picked the Cubs, costing myself several World Series titles but learning the meaning of the word \"angst'' at an early age. \nUntil 2004, the Cubs and Red Sox shared the frustration of not winning a World Series since before 1920 - a drought shared until 2005 by the White Sox, who were never accoorded the same national sympathy. Since 2004, the Red Sox have won three titles while until Wednesday's 4-0 wild-card win in Pittsburgh, the Cubs had not even won a playoff game in that time. \nStill, some parallels remain. Baseball matters very much in both markets, unlike many cities where the sport merely keeps people company until football camp begins. \nThe teams play in baseball's last two ancient cathedrals, Fenway Park and Wrigley Field. The Red Sox advertise Fenway \"America's Most Beloved Ballpark,'' causing people like myself to ask when such an election took place. \nThe Cubs didn't even install lights until 1988, and a video scoreboard was finally added this year, though only a firestorm of protest from the neighborhood. The Cubs have overpaid for some players in the past, but no team has better managed its electric bill. \nThe biggest difference between the teams is often mistakenly described as the most striking similarity. The fans reflect their own geographic regions. They are not the same. \nLike New England itself, Red Sox fans are passionate yet hardened, and the accent is often on the negative. Three World Series titles in 12 seasons have softened the hard edge, but it's still a more practical, cynical passion than is found in Chicago, where suspicion mostly takes a back seat to hope. \nIt always struck me odd that even before 2004, Red Sox fans generally had good, competitive teams that couldn't finish the deal in October. The Cubs generally had bad, non-competitive teams that rarely made it to October. \nWhen Red Sox fans lamented their ill fate, I would think of losing seasons at Wrigley and think, \"Really? Get a taste of our world.'' \nBecause hope springs eternal in the Midwest, Cubs fans endured for three years what Red Sox fans won't tolerate for one. When Theo Epstein left the Red Sox for the Cubs, he truthfully declared his new team a mess that would need years of rebuilding to straighten out. \nFrom 2012 through 2014, the Cubs averaged 95 losses a year - the worst three-year stretch in the history of a team that was formed in 1871 and has specialized in bad three-year stretches. The crowds went down and there was grumbling, but the passion - and the hope - never went away. \nEven without ultimate victory, a lifetime of Cub passion (and no, we don't call it Cub Nation - don't get me started) has had its benefits. I met my wife because of the Cubs. \nWhen I was single in the 1990s, I would occasionally take baseball trips to Chicago. On one such trip, I struck up a conversation with Laura's brother. A friendship developed, and later I met his sister, who became Mrs. Chimelis in 2000. \n\"You have to root for the Cubs,'' I tell my daughter. \"Without them, there would be no you.'' \nIt's fun to root for a team that's out of your market. It feels like yours and not everyone's, and it's also easier to tune them out - a useful option given this franchise's history. \nThe Cubs have taught me patience, something Red Sox fans frankly don't have in abundance. When your team's last World Series title was in 1908, you don't get all worked up by having to stand in the checkout line for an extra five minutes. \nCubs fans are not better people than other fans. Our clan treated foul-ball-pursuer Steve Bartman unforgivably in 2003, and despite several public attempts to welcome him back, I don't think he's forgiven us and I don't blame him. \nWhat Red Sox fans and others should understand most is that the notion of Cubs fans not caring about winning is an absurd myth. We care more than anybody, the way a parched soul in the Sahara Desert would care about a drink of water. \nAnd this year seems different because the narrative has changed. In 2004, the Red Sox overcame their non-existent \"curse'' by collecting goofballs like Johnny Damon and Kevin Millar, who laughed at the past - and by discarding Nomar Garciparra, a talented but serious sort who seemed burdened and overwhelmed by it. \nUnder one-of-a-kind manager Joe Maddon, the 2015 Cubs are not ruminating about past failures but enjoying current success. They are having fun playing baseball, which is making baseball fun for the fans, and not the normal Greek tragedy associated with this franchise. \nThey are loaded with talented guys between ages 21 and 25. It's a nice fit for a fan base that aches to look at baseball through young, naive and innocent eyes. \nFifty-one years after moving from Illinois, and long past the age where I realized that baseball was a business and that making your team's identity your was immature and illogical, this still matters to me more than it should. I don't cover this team for media, as I have done with the Red Sox, but it frees up my emotional soul to root for them. \nIf you want to hop on the bandwagon, we long-suffering fans will make room for you with a smile. And you should, because something tells us this is the year, at last. \nWe believe one of these centuries has to be ours. It might as well be this one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:11:03.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
