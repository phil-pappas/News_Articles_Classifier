More than 14,000 thousand people there voted\nIn Orleans Parish, there were just under 13,000 early voters.\nStill, the gubernatorial race is far from over.\nA FOX 8 | Raycom poll shows that both Vitter and lone democratic candidate, State Rep. John Bel Edwards are leading the race. Vitter is at 21% and Edwards is at 24%.\nMonday night at the governor's mansion, Edwards will take the stage along with Louisiana Public Services Commissioner Scott Angelle, and Lt. Governor Jay Dardenne.\nAs for Vitter, political analyst Mike Sherman says that even though his numbers are hopeful right now, they are not set in stone.\n\"It looks like John Bel Edwards is a bet to make a run off. The question is can David Vitter remain on top of that Republican pack or will something happen here in this last week to change the fundamentals in this election,\" Sherman said. \"David Vitter is being a very disciplined candidate, not showing up at debates, staying away from the media spotlight, thinking that if he sits atop, he can focus on a run off.\"\nYou can watch the debate Monday at 7 p.m. on Louisiana Raycom stations.\nThe election is Saturday.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
