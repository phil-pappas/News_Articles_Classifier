Folks who check out, say, his Instagram feed are treated to photos of his high-priced cars, watches and private-jet flights to exotic locales. \nOn Wednesday, Mayweather posted a photo of some other items he’s collected that aren’t available to the average person, but this time, they weren’t things that could be bought in even the most high-end of stores. He added this caption: \n“It took 19 years but they’ll talk about it forever.” \nThose would be the championship belts, or at least a whopping 24 or so of them, that Mayweather collected over his 19-year career. According to Box Rec.com, in addition to various other titles, the fighter won the following world titles: WBC Super Featherweight WBC Welterweight (two different times) WBC Super Welterweight (two different times) WBA Super Welterweight Super WBA Welterweight Super WBO Welterweight \nIt remains to be seen how long folks talk about Mayweather, but his name will certainly come up for years to come in any discussion of greatest defensive fighters. Of course, a corollary to that would be his inclusion in any discussion of least-exciting (at least in the ring) boxing superstars. \nMayweather has been insistent that his September defeat of Andre Berto was his last fight ever, and that he has taken his 49-0 record into retirement. However, whispers of him re-emerging to take on Gennady Golovkin, or even Manny Pacquiao again, haven’t gone away, and if that were to happen, Mayweather would certainly give ’em something about which to talk.
