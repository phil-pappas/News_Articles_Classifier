A Class B misdemeanor for riot, defined as \"combative behavior\" incited by two or more individuals, was dismissed. \nThe junior defensive back was ordered in 4th District Court by Judge Roger W. Griffin to pay a $250 fine and attend one anger-management class. Davis was also placed on one-year probation for the incident, according to court documents. \nAccording to court documents, Davis has also completed 30 hours of community service in relation to the case. \nDavis was charged in connection with a July 29 incident in which Provo police were called to the Old Mill Apartments in Provo when a dispute broke out over a parking space. The alleged victim sustained \"minor, visible injuries\" to the back of the neck, a Provo police spokesperson told the Deseret News, leading to Davis' citation for which he pleaded not guilty in August. \nDavis has appeared in all five games in 2015 for the Cougars, totaling 14 total tackles and two pass breakups with a season-high six tackles in BYU's season opener at Nebraska on Sept. 5. \nThe Cougars host East Carolina on Saturday at 5:30 p.m. MT in a game that will be broadcast on KSL NewsRadio and ESPNU.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:06:32.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
