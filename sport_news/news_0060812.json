The Lions two-point conversion failed, giving MTCS a 7-6 lead. \nPage finished 10-of-21 passing for 167 yards. Litchford had seven catches for 140 yards. \nMTCS started the second quarter with a nice drive, but the Lions defense tightened and held the Cougars on fourth and 16 when quarterback Joseph Peck’s pass fell incomplete. \nCannon County took over on downs, but MTCS’ Brayden Melton (12 tackles, 9 solo) recovered a Lions fumble on the next play. \nFour plays later, Green scored on a 7-yard TD run and MTCS (5-2) extended its lead to 14-6 with 8:05 left in the second quarter. \nGreen found the end zone again on a 6-yard run to make it 21-6 with five minutes left in the half. \nThe Cougars continued to pound the ball on the ground in the second half, and Peck (12 carries, 113 yards) outran the Lions defense for a 24-yard touchdown run with 9:50 left in the third quarter to take a 27-6 lead. \nCannon County (0-8) mounted a 63-yard scoring drive of its own midway through the third quarter with some precision passing by quarterback Brady Page. The Lions finished the drive when Page connected with Litchford on a 16-yard scoring strike. \nPeck sealed the win for MTCS late in the fourth quarter with a 10-yard rushing touchdown and extended the Cougars lead to three scores. 56 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.dnj.com/1Rzlnlh TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:37:22.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
