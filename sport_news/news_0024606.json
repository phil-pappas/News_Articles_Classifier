Just a lot of big punches as he dominated his middleweight title fight with David Lemieux. \nGolovkin battered Lemieux around the ring Saturday night on the big stage at Madison Square Garden, landing punch after punch before the referee mercifully stepped in and stopped the fight in the eighth round. He remained unbeaten in 34 fights, and stopped his opponent for the 21st straight time. \nFighting before a sold-out crowd of 20,548 cheering his every move, Golovkin was methodical as he knocked down Lemieux in the fourth round, bloodied his nose and dominated almost every second of the way. \nLemieux was on the ropes taking punch after punch when Steve Willis finally stepped in at 1: 32 of the eighth round to call an end to the fight.
