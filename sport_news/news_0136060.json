When we pitched historically, they didn't even want to talk to us because we were in Denver.\"\nChasin, who spoke Wednesday during a Denver Startup Week session , said his company has raised $17 million from West Coast firms.\nProtectWise became a Denver Gazelle , a distinction the city uses to honor fast growing tech startups. Other 2015 honorees include Altitude Digital, a digital advertising firm; Four Winds Interactive, which builds software for digital signs; and Wayin, which helps companies better use social media and which was started by Sun Microsystems co-founder Scott McNealy.\nAdvertisement Denver is also working to distinguish itself from nearby Boulder, home to accelerator Techstars and a well-known venture capitalist .\n\"There was an assumption that you were from Boulder,\" said Bryan Leach, whose shopping app Ibotta was a Denver Gazelle in 2012 and just announced $40 million in new investment . \"And it was like, 'Oh, do you know Brad Feld?' Yeah, I know Brad Feld. That was the question you got at every single meeting you had on Sand Hill Road. Now when you go out there, it's 'Oh, do you know Eric Rosa (Datalogix CEO)?' 'Do you know Dan Caruso (Zayo Group's co-founder and CEO)?' \"\nOracle, based in Redwood City, Calif., bought Datalogix last year for $1 billion. Boulder's Zayo went public a year ago.\n\"The critical mass of success stories and high-profile exits has totally changed. Now private-equity funds assign people to cover the Denver area. That wasn't happening before,\" Leach said. \"But I think we still got a long way to go.\"\nPaul Washington, executive director of the Denver Office of Economic Development, said the city is committed to doing what it can to help startups grow big in Denver.\n\"Early on in my tenure in this position four years ago, the mayor and I were traveling and lamenting, 'How come these other cities — like-size or smaller — have all these Fortune 500 companies? I'll use Minneapolis as a great example. They've got more than their fair share of Fortune 500 companies,\" Washington said.\nHe did some research and found that most of those companies were homegrown.\n\"Part of our long-term strategy is we run these risks (of helping startups that get acquired and move), but frankly, we're intent on growing our own Fortune 500 companies, and, no doubt, a number of these Gazelles are on that path. All we can do is keep Denver attractive and make sure this is a place where you want to grow a business.\"\nTo add some outsider perspective, Scott McNealy, CEO of Wayin, which just raised $14 million, chimed in.\n\"I would say more has changed in California than has changed in Colorado,\" said McNealy, a harsh critic of California's business climate — a big reason why he picked Denver to launch Wayin. \"The prices of everything have skyrocketed. The regulations. The pension deficit. The traffic. It's just not a fun place to go start.\"\nTamara Chuang: 303-954-1209, tchuang @denverpost.com or @Gadgetress", "external_links": ["http://www.wsj.com/articles/oracle-paid-more-than-1-2-billion-for-datalogix-1423083774", "http://www.denverstartupweek.org/schedule/1456-meet-the-2015-denver-gazelles", "http://www.feld.com/"], "published": "2015-09-30T14:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:35:57.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
