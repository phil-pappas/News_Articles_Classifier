Now we're going to celebrate tonight. \n\n\"I want to thank my parents as well, they've been fantastic and my little brother too.\" \n\nZanotti, 32 from Asuncion, who began the day one shot off the lead, overcame an inconsistent round that included five birdies against three bogeys as he finished tied for second despite a bogey at 18. \n\nKjeldsen also settled for a tie for second with the charging Lowry after the WGC-Brigestone International champion carded a final round 67 that included five birdies over the final 18 holes. \n\nAlmost 60,000 spectators attended the EPGA tournament that was returning to the European circuit for the first time since 2008. \n\nFitzpatrick had been flirting with his first win at the top level for some time and has been touted as one of English golf's brightest prospects since finishing as top amateur at the 2013 British Open. \n\nZanotti was bidding for his second EPGA victory, after winning the 2014 BMW International Open. \n\nKjeldsen won the Irish Open in a playoff in May to end a six-year drought. \n\nAustralian Marcus Fraser finished strongly with a final round 67 to share fifth place with Frenchman Mike Lorenzo-Vera, former world number one Luke Donald of England and Thailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat. \n\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:36:40.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
