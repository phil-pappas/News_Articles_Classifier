(Photo: Dennis Wierzbicki, USA TODAY Sports)\n5 CONNECT 27 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE CHICAGO — The Chicago Blackhawks raised their Stanley Cup championship banner Wednesday before their home opener against the New York Rangers after a summer of listening to people raising questions about whether the their dynasty is over.\nIt’s as if the hockey world is presenting the Blackhawks with another challenge to help them in their pursuit of their fourth Stanley Cup in seven seasons.\n\"It doesn’t matter what situation we get ourselves into,\" Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews said. \"We have a knack to make ourselves a really tough team to beat.\"\nThe place the Blackhawks found themselves in this summer was salary-cap hell. Lacking cap space, they were forced to trade Brandon Saad and Patrick Sharp, and let Johnny Oduya sign elsewhere as a free agent. Then superstar Patrick Kane was accused of rape by a Buffalo area woman. He hasn’t been arrested or charged, but the law enforcement investigation is ongoing.\nSaad is a young star and Sharp a proven veteran. The Blackhawks essentially used only four defensemen in the Stanley Cup Final, and Oduya was one of those four. The Blackhawks market around Kane.\nUSA TODAY\nChicago Blackhawks preview: Champions forced to retool their roster\nKane has said that he expects to be \"absolved\" of any wrongdoing, but his case has caused major difficulty for the Blackhawks organization. No matter how they handled it, they were going to be criticized.\nNot a day goes by that there is isn’t some form of internet debate among fans and non-fans about Kane’s future with the Blackhawks.\nChicago fans have been supportive of Kane, but no one can predict what it will be like for Kane on the road this season.\nKane has said he’s been able to focus on hockey. \"I feel good when I get to the rink to be honest,\" he told the media Tuesday. \"My little getaway from everything is coming (to the rink), being with the guys, playing hockey, doing things I love.\"\nUSA TODAY\nAllen: The 2015-16 NHL season through my crystal ball\nThe Erie County district attorney’s office has provided no timetable on when it will make a decision about whether Kane will be charged.\nKane is projected to have new linemates this season: Russian veteran Artem Anisimov, who played last season in Columbus, and Russian rookie Artemi Panarin, who played last season in the Russia-based Kontinental Hockey League.\nIt feels as if the Blackhawks are trying to give Kane a chance to have a symbolic fresh start.\n\"He hadn’t skated much coming in here, but I felt he’s gotten better every day,\" Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville said. \"He’s focused in the right way. I commend him on how he’s handled things.\"\nUSA TODAY\nTop Shelf podcast: Previews and predictions for the upcoming NHL season\nIt was perhaps fitting that the Chicago Cubs had an important playoff game on the night the Blackhawks raised the banner.\nThe Blackhawks probably wouldn’t mind losing the spotlight for a while.\nAnd they certainly don’t mind people thinking their dynasty is over after six seasons. They don’t feel that way. They don’t ever doubt themselves, which is why they have won a multitude of important games since 2010. The Ming dynasty lasted 276 years, and right now the Blackhawks are focused on extending theirs to a seventh year.\n\"We have a big group that’s been here and knows how to win and knows how to play the right way,\" Quenneville said. \"It’s a special place to play. It’s a fun challenge knowing everybody’s ready for you. Our challenge is, we want to get off to a great start, making sure we are playing the right way and let’s go.\"\nFollow columnist Kevin Allen on Twitter @ByKevinAllen .\nUSA TODAY\nTop Shelf podcast: Breaking down the ultra-competitive Central Division\n5 CONNECT 27 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/ByKevinAllen", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9f80fac06b12a898aac39870c588b4a02c4b505d/c=472-0-2358-1886/local/-/media/2015/10/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796917807640189-blues.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7b53a5a52debb42b71f3deac36f01e238d03a6b9/c=157-0-1991-1834/local/-/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796675092644331-USP-NHL-Stanley-Cup-Playoffs-Chicago-Blackhawks-a.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f34f262101012832ae7f8ce733ae2e7514231eb7/c=399-74-1767-1898&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798423212334257-2015-10-07-Patrick-Kane.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a57d5cda905b50a4fa4dacfbd7581a2518e64d64/c=525-142-1939-941&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796569681312921-USP-NHL-Montreal-Canadiens-at-Boston-Bruins.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RuxRKW&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798423212334257-2015-10-07-Patrick-Kane.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e6b1b105ffb28c066cbff65dd88456b87a7a7569/c=164-0-1566-1402/local/-/media/2015/10/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/635796648391539602-NYrangers.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1RuxRKW&text=Allen%3A%20After%20tumultuous%20offseason%2C%20Blackhawks%20ready%20to%20silence%20doubters&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/734fac10538d13406c1d7cd31ef155a9e07b4676/r=300x400/local/-/media/2015/10/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/635798423212334257-2015-10-07-Patrick-Kane.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:23:19.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
