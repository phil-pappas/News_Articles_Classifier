We believe we’re capable of doing some great things. We want to make sure that we’re mentally prepared.” \nPhillipsburg has already taken a small measure of revenge this fall by beating North Hunterdon in a regular-season contest, after the Lions beat the ’Liners three times in 2014, including in the H/W/S final. \nNow, if Phillipsburg is going to continue its journey toward ending its 26-year drought, it needs to check off another team from its payback list.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:54:48.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
