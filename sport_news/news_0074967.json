Tennessee Titans wide receiver Harry Douglas said the former Alabama standout can be more than that.\nJones can become \"the greatest player to ever play this game,\" Douglas said.\nJones and Douglas spent four seasons as teammates in Atlanta before Douglas joined Tennessee for this season. They'll be back on the same field on Sunday when the Falcons visit the Titans at noon CDT.\nRELATED: NFL WEEK 7 SCHEDULE, TV, ODDS\n\"I know how much he puts into it,\" Douglas said of Jones. \"I know how hard he works and how much he loves the game. He does everything in his power to be successful and help his team in any way possible. That's not just catching balls. That's blocking, putting in time at the complex and in the weight room. Being able to play with him for all those years I did, I know his work ethic. I know he's an unbelievable player. Like I said, he has a chance to be the greatest player to ever play this game.\"\nIn Atlanta's first three games this season, Jones caught 34 passes for 440 yards and four touchdowns. He became the first Atlanta player to start a season with three straight 100-yard games and the first player in NFL history with at least 135 receiving yards in each of his team's first three games in a season. His 34 receptions rank as the most an NFL player has had three games into a season.\nIn the three games since that record-setting start , Jones has caught 15 passes for 198 yards and no touchdowns.\nCornerback Jason McCourty said the slowdown doesn't affect Jones' status.\n\"So far this year, he has been the best receiver (in the NFL),'' McCourty said of Jones. \"Look at the numbers he has put up, and it's hard to say someone has been better than him this year. But whether you say he's first, second, third or whatever, he's right there at the top of this league.\"\nJones still ranks second in the NFL in receiving yards with 638 and second in receptions with 49.\nFOR MORE OF AL.COM'S COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE NFL, GO TO OUR NFL PAGE\nJones' dropoff in production followed a hamstring injury in the fourth game of the season on Oct. 4. The former Foley High School star missed practices and was listed as questionable on the injury reports for Atlanta's fifth and sixth games.\nAfter winning their first five games, the Falcons fell to the New Orleans Saints 31-21 in Game No. 6 on Oct. 25. The loss had a silver lining, though. Because it came in a Thursday night game, Jones got an extended period of rest, and he doesn't appear on the NFL injury report for Sunday's game.\n\"I feel like I've been able to go out there and keep pushing and making plays and doing the little things right,\" Jones said . \"(This week), I'm good to go.\"\nRELATED: ALABAMA'S ALL-TIME PRO BOWL ROSTER", "external_links": ["http://www.myajc.com/news/sports/football/julio-jones-ready-to-rebound/nn74d/", "http://www.titansonline.com/news/article-4/Three-Quick-Hits-from-Wednesdays-Practice/d987e8a6-2752-4970-b109-4312e79a7b09", "http://www.nfl.com/injuries", "http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/atlanta-falcons-tennessee-titans-julio-jones-harry-douglas-102215", "http://player.performgroup.com/eplayer.js#a932dfb5c529cda1ea78b0d193.1gzn3p95xxmaz11gdqtqkjuxqq.s"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:55:45.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
