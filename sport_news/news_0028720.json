But there is another demographic that makes Salt Lake County's urban fisheries important recreational amenities: Senior citizens.\n\"It's not just for kids,\" said Division of Wildlife Resources central region fisheries manager Mike Slater. \"We anticipated these fisheries being a place for youth. But adults use them. We get calls on a weekly basis asking when they have been stocked.\"\nSome anglers say gathering at these ponds is better than spending time in a senior citizens center.\n  \"This should be called grandpa's pond,\" said Roger Olsen, a senior who regularly angles Salt Lake County's urban fisheries such as Sandy's urban pond. Olsen said seniors regularly gather at the pond, adding, \"This has extended my fishing life. It's not for the kids. It's for us old guys.\"\nMonte Rouska of Kearns said Kidney Pond is his favorite, but he doesn't think it is stocked regularly.\n\"This beats driving to Strawberry,\" he said while fishing Sandy Pond, where he caught and released a couple of nice trout.\nThat echoed a common theme among senior anglers who are on fixed incomes and may not have the money it takes to regularly fish outside of the urban areas.\nRouska said he and other regular anglers love it when the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources plants big brood stock from hatcheries.\n\"Someone caught a 20-inch lake trout last year,\" said Rouska.\nKelly Johnson of West Jordan refers to time spent on Willow Pond in Murray as \"On Golden Pond.\" He hadn't fished in about a year but, after having surgery, he bought a license. Johnson fishes at Willow Pond almost daily.\n\"It gets people out of the house,\" said Johnson. \"They are close. You don't have to drive a long ways. It's the best thing that ever happened to us old guys.\"\nThese urban waters also draw in wildlife. At Sandy Pond, dozens of birds used the water, some of which is off-limits to anglers.\n\"You need to look around for birds, especially in the spring,\" said Olsen. \"There are all kinds of birds. There is an osprey nest nearby. People should get a bird book and get kids interested in birds.\"\nSalt Lake County's urban ponds have many similarities. Laws are pretty standard. The limit is two fish and adults must have a license.\nSlater said the ponds receive such heavy pressure that having a two fish limit spreads the opportunity. Many anglers catch and release.\nSeniors fishing Willow and Sandy ponds say conservation officers regularly check the areas. Catchable rainbow trout are stocked early in the spring and later in the year regularly. Many have largemouth bass (anglers are asked to voluntarily release these fish) as well as channel catfish, bluegill and crappie.\nSlater said stocking usually ends about the middle of October. The idea is to have most of the rainbow trout harvested before the ponds ice over in winter. Ice is usually unsafe and ice fishing is either discouraged or outright prohibited.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:34:14.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
