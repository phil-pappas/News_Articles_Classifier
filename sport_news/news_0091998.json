A little more than 24 hours later, he was punting in the most pressurized game of the Jets' season thus far. \nUnfortunately for Weatherford, two of his punts Sunday might draw some irate calls. \nWeatherford, who punted for the Jets in 2009-10, was re-signed Saturday and filled in for injured Ryan Quigley against the Patriots. He averaged 30.8 yards net on four punts. His 31-yarder in the second quarter led to a 47-yard touchdown drive by the Pats, and he hit a 33-yarder in the fourth that was returned by Danny Amendola for 11 yards to the Patriots' 32. \nNew England's subsequent 68-yard TD march gave it a commanding 10-point lead. \nWeatherford, who was released by the Giants on Sept. 4 and has been working on a burgeoning broadcasting career, admitted being somewhat rusty. \n\"I haven't punted with a snap [and] haven't put on a helmet in [almost] two months,\" Weatherford said. \"It was very difficult, not so much mentally [but physically]. … Punting and kicking is very similar to golfing. If you don't do it for awhile, it's not like riding a bike.\" \nJets coach Todd Bowles indicated that Quigley showed up at the team's Florham Park complex with a swollen right shin, possibly from the effects of some sort of medication. Bowles said Quigley \"was completely healthy all week.\" \nIvory hamstrung \nJets RB Chris Ivory tweaked his hamstring when he was tackled hard Sunday on the first play from scrimmage. He finished the game, but shared time with backup Zac Stacy. Other than a 9-yard scoring reception in the third quarter, he couldn't get untracked, finishing with a season-low 41 yards on 17 carries as the Patriots often stacked the box. \n\"It's tough for something like that to happen on the first play,\" said Ivory, who rode a stationary bike and also ran in place on the sideline to get loose. \nBriefs \nSS Calvin Pryor left the game with an ankle injury. Bowles had no update on his condition. Bowles also said C Nick Mangold will have to get X-rays on his neck. He left the game with 54 seconds to play, and literally adding insult to injury, the Jets were charged with a timeout per NFL rules. \n— J.P.
