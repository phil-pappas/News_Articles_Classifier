He spent several days in a coma with wife Khloe Kardashian and other family members by his bedside. Contrary to some claims, Kardashian did NOT have a “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” camera crew inside the hospital.\nIn fact, there was a strict ban on photography inside Odom’s hospital room. Now TMZ claims “several” unnamed hospital workers attempted to “sneak a photo” of him. It’s also claimed the employees tried to access his medical records, too.\nIt’s not clear how hospital management found out about the alleged breaches, but the staffers were fired. A rep for Sunrise tells TMZ, “We take all patient privacy very seriously and follow all HIPAA policies in compliance with federal regulations.” Odom is now getting care at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.\nAt that facility, there has reportedly been a lockdown on who can enter Odom’s hospital room, as well as a limitation on the number of employees treating him, in order to limit information leaks. TMZ even recently reported that there’s security standing guard outside his door 24/7. Gossip Cop will continue to have updates as appropriate.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://gossipcop.com/tag/lamar-odom", "http://www.etonline.com/partners/can/index.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyxle.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Khloe", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmqqJQ.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyxle.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Kim", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmkiuZ.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BBkkQsl&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Khloe", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmpYoi.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BBkkIUP&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Khloe", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmgiLR.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB4FzyU.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Khloe", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyIp2.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Khloe", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;basketball_nba&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:false,&quot;Mute&quot;:false,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:45:08.764+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
