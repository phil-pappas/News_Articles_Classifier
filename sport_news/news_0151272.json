Carey also added a 76-yard kickoff return to open the second half that led to another score.\nAndover’s offense, which had looked so precise in last week’s huge upset of BC High, looked far different in the slop. Prolific junior triggerman E.J. Perry, who threw for over 300 yards and four scores a week ago, was held to just one scoring strike as he was hounded by the relentless Redmen defensive front and saw his stable of talented receivers blanketed all evening.\n“I’m not going to lie, the weather conditions might have helped us more than it helped them,” Tewksbury coach Brian Aylward said, “but you know what? If it’s different next week we’re still going to show up and be ready to play.”\nLeading 15-6 at the break, Carey’s slashing kickoff return set the hosts up deep in Andover territory. Two plays later, Tewksbury (4-0) went into its bag of tricks when junior running back Tyler Ward found a wide-open Steve Rosa on an option pass.\nPerry and Andover (3-1) marched right down the field to get back within 10 on Anthony Christopher’s 1-yard plunge, but Carey and the Tewksbury defense were not about to let the Golden Warriors extinguish this upset. Carey picked off Perry from his cornerback slot to officially put a cork in it with just two minutes to go.\n“E.J. is a good player and they run a good system,” said Aylward, who lauded the work of his assistant coaches and scout team.\n“It’s a matter of pick your poison and what do you try to take away from them. I think we were able to (be successful).”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:13:54.872+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
