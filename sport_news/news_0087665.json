The presumptive postseason favorite Blue Jays once again find themselves in the position of having to win three consecutive games to survive, down 3-1 to the seemingly unkillable Royals in the ALCS, with Game Five Wednesday afternoon. Kansas City claimed a 14-2 victory Tuesday, behind a starting pitcher coping with loss . In the National League, the Mets have made what had been a red-hot Cubs team look deficient. Behind stalwart starting pitching, a hot streak of unimaginable proportions from Daniel Murphy and a relentlessness that looks an awful lot like that of Kansas City, New York owns a 3-0 advantage in the series. The Mets have the chance to clinch their first pennant in 15 seasons Wednesday night at Wrigley Field . The Cubs are grasping at the straws of Red Sox history, as you'd expect . All four of baseball's semifinalists can teach Boston some lessons about team construction. It isn't a coherent blueprint for universal success; the game isn't that simple. But Kansas City, Toronto, New York and Chicago have all shown means to a successful end. I explored what the Red Sox can learn from 2015's final four, first in the American League and then in the National League . There are also more specific, individualized lessons playing out in the LCS themselves. For instance, is Johnny Cueto really the kind of ace you want to invest in long term? Jason Mastrodonato at the Boston Herald has his doubts after Cueto fell apart in more ways than one at Rogers Centre on Tuesday . Mastrodonato also explored how Blue Jays fans feel about John Farrell now . Late last week, I looked at how the Red Sox might address their bullpen woes — something Toronto became familiar with on Tuesday. Jason Varitek interviewed for the managerial opening in Seattle . *** If you awoke this morning feeling unstuck in time like Billy Pilgrim , that’s because this October 21 is a date of intriguing historical significance. It is of course the date that Doc Brown and Marty McFly jumped forward to in Back to the Future: Part II — which would make for a particularly crushing date for the Cubs to be knocked out of the NLCS. It's also the 40th anniversary of arguably the most famous game in Red Sox history and one we're apt to call the very best. Page 2 of 3 - \"Game Six, Game Six…what can we say of it without seeming to diminish it by recapitulation or dull it with detail?\" Roger Angell asked in the New Yorker back in 1975 . Ian Browne of MLB.com , for one, was not rebuffed by Angell's query, tackling the question four decades later with the assistance of Fred Lynn, Dwight Evans and Tony Perez. \"Everyone remembers it,\" Evans said, \"all baseball fans.\" Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe recalls what it was like to be there that night , just starting his career in journalism. And of course, you can't talk about Game Six in '75 without mentioning Peter Gammons' game story from the night itself . *** The absolute must-read of the week: Tim Casey from Vice Sports on the indomitable Jonny Miller of WBZ . Working with Jonny tends to remind you how fundamentally cool this job is and how it should never be taken for granted. Great stories from the past week that looking back at now remind you how much has happened in the past week: Barry Svrluga of the Washington Post on Jose Bautista's bat flip ; Adam Kilgore of the Post on Tom Lawless' epic bat flip from the '87 World Series ; Jeff Sullivan of Fangraphs on the inning that contained all of baseball ; Angell (still writing these days) on the Mets' Game Five win over the Dodgers . (My brief thoughts: the moment between Bautista's home run and his invention of bat javelin was cooler than the toss itself, Lawless' really holds up, Toronto and Texas' seventh inning was like Game Six of the 2011 World Series reduced to a single frame, and nothing beats Angell referring to Murphy's heads-up swipe of third as feeling \"like a social error, spilled claret on the tablecloth\" or to the first round of the postseason as \"the abattoir of the Divisionals.\") David Roth of Vice Sports looks wide-eyed at Murphy's postseason (written before his three home runs in the NLCS) as a metaphor for the playoffs as a whole . As someone who briefly covered Murphy back in 2009, I can confirm that Roth is right about Murphy's occasionally \"avant-garde\" way of playing the game. He is a player who takes far too many risks on the basepaths and with the glove, and he is riding the greatest run of his baseball life in all aspects. Page 3 of 3 - Scott Lauber of the Herald on Manny Ramirez, critical mentor for the Cubs . Rob Bradford of WEEI.com reports Yoan Moncada might not be playing winter ball due to a hand injury . Shaughnessy caught up with Daniel Okrent, the founder of fantasy baseball, to reflect on what it's become . There are comparisons to J. Robert Oppenheimer, as a tease. Our Bill Reynolds thinks back to his first meeting with Lamar Odom , as the former URI star continues to fight for his life. *** FYI: The plan is to do this newsletter about once a week in the offseason — probably with some holiday time off — just to recap what's going on in the Red Sox and baseball universe.
