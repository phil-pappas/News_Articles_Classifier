This is a really good experience for everybody,” said Montero, who called for the breaking pitch he couldn’t block in the sixth that turned into the go-ahead run when Yoenis Cespedes scored from third.\n“Obviously, coming in next year for spring training there’s going to be an even higher expectation. The guys know what it feels like to be on this type of stage, and I hope every guy next year will come back even hungrier than this year.\n“But we’re still playing this year. It’s not over until it’s over.”\nOnly one team in major-league postseason history has come back from a 3-games-to-none deficit: Theo Epstein’s Boston Red Sox “Idiots” of 2004, who came back on the Yankees in the ALCS before winning the World Series.\n“One New York team has blown a 3-0 lead, “ first baseman Anthony Rizzo said. “Let’s make it the other New York team.”\n“It’s happened before. We’re really looking forward to getting back out to the ballpark tomorrow,” said rookie Kyle Schwarber, who hit his franchise-record fifth home run of the postseason to tie the game in the first – but dropped a Cespedes drive to left in the seventh that led to two runs.\n“I just mis-read it. No excuses,”\nSchwarber, one of three rookies in the lineup Tuesday and one of four who have played regularly down the stretch and into the postseason, is one of the reasons this postseason was supposed to be a bonus for this team – an earlier-than-expected taste in what’s supposed to be an extended window for one of the youngest cores on baseball.\n“They’re young, too,” Rizzo, another first-time playoff Cub, said of the Mets and their 100-mph rotation of first- and second-year pitchers. “This is their first taste of postseason. This is our first taste for the most part. They’ve got veteran players, but all those pitchers we’re facing are just as young as we are.”\nAnd through three games they’ve made this Cubs playoff team look a lot like the last few – right down to the plumbing bashing reminiscent of Ted Lilly’s destruction of a pipe in the dugout at Dodger Stadium in 2008.\n“I’m really happy that it’s not a five-game series,” said first-year Cubs manager Joe Maddon when asked about the Red Sox’ historic comeback in 2004. “The fact we still have an opportunity to come back and do this, of course you think about those things. You think about the parallels, thing about the fact that, that happened against a New York team. But it’s up to us to go out and execute.”\nWhich has been nearly impossible against a Matt Harvey-Noah Syndergaard-Jacob deGrom trio of starters who have held the Cubs to five runs in 20 1/3 innings (2.21 ERA), striking out 24 and walking just four.\nThat doesn’t even count the only guy hitting more homers this postseason than Schwarber.\nThe Mets’ Daniel Murphy’s third-inning homer off Kyle Hendricks gave him five consecutive postseason games with a homer, tying Carlos Beltran’s 2004 record.\nIt was his sixth overall of the postseason, extending the Mets’ single-postseason record.\n“It’s a little frustrating, but we’ve got to move past it and we’ve got to keep going,” said Schwarber, whose mammoth Division Series home run is already immortalized in Plexiglas. “It’s been done before, and this team’s done some special things throughout this whole season.”\nRizzo: “We know what we’re up against now. We’ve got to win. That’s it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:10:07.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
