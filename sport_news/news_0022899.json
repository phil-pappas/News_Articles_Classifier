Three-time winner Federer is introduced to his adoring fans with great pomp and ceremony at the Qi Zhong Stadium.Wearing black at the bottom of the screen, the second seed was put under a lot of pressure in the opening set and couldn't force a break-through on the Spaniard's serve, thanks to shots like this one. The set would eventually go to a tie-break.The 17 time grand slam champ would collapse with a string of unforced errors, which Ramos-Vinolas was all too happy to accept, and he took the breaker 7-4.. However, Roger would come out fighting in the second set and his power and precision was too much for the Spaniard, whose serve was broken twice. Federer looked like he was back in control of the match as he raced into a 5-2 lead. He would go on to take the set with this thrilling point at 40-30 and he looked decidedly relieved to be back in the match as Ramos-Vinolas sends it long.But the resilient Spaniard somehow found a way to stop the Federer tide in the deciding set and managed to force a break-point at 4-3. This stunning forehand drive left Federer in a perilous position late in the match. The Swiss Maestro wasn't able to break back at 5-3 and the World No 70 Ramos-Vinolas claimed the biggest scalp of his career to date, and he marches on to the next round.
