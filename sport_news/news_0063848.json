Then, teaching the nuances of the game to your little one will be the best way to pass on your passion and your expertise to posterity! When you take your four-year-old to a golf course, introducing him to the basics of swings, putts, stance and grip, it actually gives you a great opportunity to brush up on parent-child bonding. However, teaching a child how to golf is a different ball game. For the child, it is going to be a huge undertaking. The kind of body and muscle movement used in the game is overtly challenging for children with small frames. The key, therefore, is to get your kids interested in the game, and you have to take the fun route toward this goal. Here are four tips that will help you to accomplish your mission: \nMake It Fun: \nYou may consider golf as the greatest game on earth, but there is no guarantee that your child would harbor the same feeling toward the sport. It is therefore extremely important to present the game in a fun format. Instead of getting them chained to too much technicalities, give them freedom to do whatever they want to, whack the ball the way they wish, and simply enjoy. By focusing on the fun aspects of the game initially, you can make your little one come back for more, and THAT is the first step to the making of a golfer. \nPlay Cool Mind Games: \nChildren tend to get easily bored, while learning the basics of swings and drives. You need to have a lot patience and resilience. Encourage them when they try, and appreciate them wholeheartedly when they succeed. Enthusiasm is infectious, so make a display of it! If your child sees that you are enjoying it, then chances are they'll be touched by your fervor, too. \nTalk Their Language: \nInformation overload is a big NO, when it comes to teaching golf to tiny tots. Instead of wasting the whole golfing glossary on them, use words they understand. Therefore it's not going to be a big deal if 'wide arc' becomes 'big circle' or a 'descending blow' is described as 'thumping the ground' during a training session. If you throw too much complex instructions to them, you run the risk of turning a fun time into task hours, subsequently losing their interests in the game. \nReward Them: \nAlways reward them for coming to the golf course to keep their spirits up. Don't make them wait for what they have earned. Get across the message that learning is not only fun, but also rewarding. Even if they fail to take the shots up to your expectation, still give them something to bring out the best in them. \nThe leisurely pace of golf provides a great bonding time for parents and children. Bring your child to golf courses and introduce them to the basics of the game. Once you have the basics down, your child is likely to pursue the game for years to come. No wonder, it is a common sight on courses across the US - in Dallas, Tampa, Miami or California - to see mother and daughter, father and son and grandparents and grand children teeing it up together. \nJoseph Garth Miller is an avid golfer and traveller, too. He loves to write about scenic courses, and has ample knowledge about the game so talks a lot about the best golf courses in Texas and relaxing golfing vacations. He provides easy-to-understand golfing tips through his articles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:25:44.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
