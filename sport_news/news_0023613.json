From midway through the first quarter to game’s end Monday night, the Giants did very little right and their flaws were exposed once again in prime time against a despised NFC East rival that played with far greater desperation.\n\"It’s disappointing,\" Giants quarterback Eli Manning said after his team’s 27-7 defeat to the Eagles. \"I thought we came out ready to play. … I thought we fought hard and tried to hang in there, and really the start of the second quarter throughout the second half, we just got outplayed.\"\nThat would appear to be the best way to move past the kind of debacle the Giants slogged through yet again at Lincoln Financial Field.\nLook in the mirror. Tip your cap. Get ready for the Cowboys.\nIt’s one bad game for the Giants, the worst they have played all season.\nTheir worst performance of 2014 in Philadelphia turned into seven straight losses, and they can’t let that happen again.\nDumb mistakes reveal the flaws. And in some ways, dumb mistakes are the flaws.\nNow the Giants again find themselves forced to outrace their past.\nLast year, bad things happened for the Giants after a touchdown pass to Larry Donnell was negated by penalty. Victor Cruz was lost for the season on the next play.\nThis year, while driving to the same end zone, bad things happened again after a would-be catch by Donnell was ripped away by DeMeco Ryans for an interception.\nThe Eagles scored 27 consecutive points last season.\nThe Eagles scored 27 consecutive points this season.\nCollectively, the Giants had no answers.\n\"The sky isn’t falling,\" Giants left guard Justin Pugh said. \"I don’t feel like this is a repeat of last year. We’re heading in the right direction and we’ll be all right. We still have everything in front of us. We’re 3-3. The Eagles are now 3-3. Dallas is 2-3.\n\"We’ve got everything in our sights still.\"\nCruz might also be ready to make another run at The Return very soon.\nThere is guarded optimism from the Giants regarding Cruz’s progress, a source told The Record on Tuesday. He has no pain in his left calf and is scheduled to undergo an MRI today. If all goes well, Cruz could gain clearance to begin running again and then practice, perhaps as early as this week.\nIt’s unlikely Cruz will be available for the Giants’ pivotal showdown with Dallas on Sunday at MetLife Stadium, but the following weekend against the Saints in New Orleans could become a realistic target date if he continues to respond to treatment.\nThe Giants have had no official word on a possible timetable for Cruz since he aggravated his calf injury three weeks ago.\nCruz received a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection Oct. 1 to help quicken the healing of his strained left calf. He attempted to practice the day before that procedure, but felt something in his calf and stopped after individual drills.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:41:28.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
