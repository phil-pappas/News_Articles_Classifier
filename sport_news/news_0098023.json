They are in jeopardy of losing 100 games for the first time since 1961 when they finished 47-107. Attendance at cozy Citizens Bank Park has dwindled and fan interest has dropped to the point of almost being nonexistent. \nMajor League Baseball’s lack of African-American players is alarming. New MLB commissioner Rob Manfred has said he’s committed to increasing African-American involvement in the game. A subtle nudge to the Phillies to seriously consider an African American to fill the general manager vacancy would help that endeavor. \nAnd there are several African-American candidates for the Phillies to choose from. Former Major League managers Willie Randolph and Davey Lopes could make a difference. Lopes is a former first base coach for the Phillies. \nThe Arizona Diamondbacks have two potential candidates in Vice President of Baseball Operations De Jon Watson and former All-Star and World Series standout Joe Carter, who serves as assistant general manager to Dave Stewart. Stewart is a former Cy Young Award winner, All-Star and World Series champion who once pitched for the Phillies. \nAnother candidate could be Enos Cabell. A 15-year MLB veteran and a member of the Houston Astros Hall of Fame, Cabell is now the special assistant to Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow. \nFinding a replacement for the now disposed Ruben Amaro Jr. will not be easy but the Phillies cannot say there aren’t any qualified African-American candidates. \nTHE GOAL OF PERFECTION \nThey aren’t ranked in the top 25 but with a victory over the University of Charlotte Friday night in Charlotte, North Carolina, the Temple University Owls could finally crack the elite grouping. The Owls are 3-0 and will be playing their third consecutive road game against the homestanding 49ers. \nCharlotte (2-2) is playing its first year as an FBS school. The program began two years ago and had been competing as an FCS institution. \nThere are many teams loaded with individual talent — Alabama, Michigan, Wisconsin and Mississippi State come to mind — but they all have something the Owls don’t have, a loss. Beating Charlotte could create a favorable stir in the rankings for the Owls. It would also do wonders for Temple’s recruiting efforts. \nREADY TO BALL \nThe Philadelphia 76ers twin towers of Nerlens Noel and rookie Jahlil Okafor, on paper, has potential. But in order for them to be effective, Sixers’ head coach Brett Brown has to figure out how to get them the ball consistently. Brown, who is 37-127 in two seasons, knows what to do with tall talent. Years ago, he was an assistant with the San Antonio Spurs who featured David Robinson and Tim Duncan. \nBrown has some thoughts about the Sixers’ tandem. In his dreams, he sees the Sixers becoming a dominating young team that could, with a few additions and subtractions, become a contender. And when Joel Embiid becomes healthy, the Sixers’ stock has the potential to improve dramatically. \nThe club is currently in training camp now at Stockton College. There are many questions such as who will be the team’s point guard and who can shoot consistently from beyond the three-point arc. Can Noel, who finished third in the NBA Rookie of the Year voting, and Okafor, play together? A lot of that depends on whether Noel, who worked on his outside shooting in the offseason, can make the transition from center to forward. \nA defensive standout, the Sixers need him to consistently hit from outside. If he can, this could be an interesting year.
