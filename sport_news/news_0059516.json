He had to settle for holding the team trophy. Hicks finished as the individual runner-up, denied after nearly draining a shot from a fairway bunker on the 18th hole. “It came out just right,” he said. “I thought it was going in. … My mom was screaming.” Hicks said he knew the situation when he swung on the shot from the bunker on the right side of the fairway. He used an 8-iron from about 165 yards, with the ball hitting and spinning within inches of the cup. He tapped in for his second consecutive birdie to close a round of 2-under par 71 at Alamance Country Club. Hicks’ three-round total of 8-under was one shot behind Virginia Commonwealth’s Adam Ball, who was tops among the 93 entrants. Hicks, who’s from Mebane and an Alamance Christian School alum, called it his best collegiate tournament. “I just trusted my game coming into this week,” he said. “… It’s something about being in Alamance County. It was great to have my family out here.” It was the first collegiate golf tournament at Alamance Country Club since 1982 when Elon won the NAIA national championship. That made this week’s event the first Division I men’s golf tournament in Alamance County. East Carolina’s participation this week came by chance. Two week ago, North Carolina’s tournament in Chapel Hill was cancelled because of persistent rain and concerns about flooding. East Carolina was among the teams looking for another event to make up for that tournament. “I’ll take that trade any time,” East Carolina coach Press McPhaul said of claiming a team championship. East Carolina’s score of 19-under 833 gave the Pirates a 23-shot victory on runner-up Charleston Southern. Virginia Commonwealth was third at 9-over, followed by Elon at 25-over in the 16-team field. Elon’s final-round 302 matched the fourth-worst score of the day. “We had a great week,” McPhaul said. “We kind of broke out of the doldrums of decent to playing good.” Hicks’ home course is Mill Creek Golf Club in Mebane. His 66 in Monday’s second round was his best college score, putting him into the lead entering Tuesday’s play. Ball posted 66 to go with a pair of 69s in the two rounds Monday. He was the only golfer in the tournament to shoot below 70 in each round. Still, the birdie with a 3-foot putt on No. 17 gave Hicks a chance. Page 2 of 2 - He was undeterred after the drive on the last hole settled in the bunker. “I wanted to know what I need to do,” Hicks said. His next shot caused a stir around the green. Elon’s Jonathan Dilanni, who was also in the final threesome, gave him a high-five and several pats on the back as they walked up the fairway. “Did you think I made it?” Hicks ask as he approached the green. “We all did,” came the response. East Carolina’s Jackson Spires and Wesley Conover placed fourth (5-under) and fifth (3-under), respectively. Elon’s top finisher was Dilanni, who slumped with a final-round 74 and finished tied for sixth place at 1-under. “It’s a good measuring stick for us to see what we have to do,” Elon coach Don Hill said. Hill, who’s in his third year with the program, said a priority was restarting a golf tournament in which Elon could serve as host. He said it was a two-year process. “It was not hard getting teams,” Hill said. “We want to get the strongest field we can get here. This golf course deserves a golf tournament like this. The golf course held its own.” East Carolina wasn’t an original entrant. When the tournament in Chapel Hill was called off, McPhaul was one of the first to call Hill. “Next time, I might block the call,” Hill said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:53:23.678+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
