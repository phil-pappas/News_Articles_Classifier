Skodnick , The Journal News 5:28 p.m. EDT October 8, 2015 The Mets' acquistion of Yoenis Cespedes at the trade deadline sparked the team's run to an unexpected National League East championship.

They've emailed, asking why there have been three articles on the Yankees on a given day and only one on the Mets. If we had our way, we'd have a reporter at every Mets game — and in that same ideal situation, we'd have a reporter for every high school sports beat, for tennis, Army football, and recreational sports — but unfortunately the realities of the modern news business limit our resources. \nWhile Yankees fans greatly outnumber Mets fans in Westchester, Rockland, and Putnam, there's no denying the amazing passion of Amazins' fans. \nIt reminded me, after more than a dozen years, of that father and son traveling eight hours only to gut out another Mets loss in another disappointing season, hoping for one more win out of a club that would go 5-7 down the stretch and end the season at 75-86. \nI have no doubt that on Friday night, when the Mets open the National League Division Series at Dodger Stadium staring down the most intimidating Los Angeles starting duo since Drysdale and Koufax, that the father and son I sat behind in Montreal will be watching. \nAfter sitting through eight years of low-budget rosters, trade deadline sales, seasons that were over by July and Octobers filled with football, Mets Dad and Son — and all Mets fans — will deservedly have their passion rewarded. \nTwitter: @LeifSkodnick 12 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1Lkyxl4 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:15:35.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
