Percy Harvin's winding and tumultuous football career has taken another strange turn. According to Vic Carucci of the Buffalo News , the Bills wide receiver is considering retiring due to a nagging hip injury.\nThis report comes on the heels of Harvin's decision to not accompany the Bills on their trip to London, where they will take on the Jaguars on Sunday.\nAdChoices \"Percy Harvin has a non-injury related (issue),\" Bills head coach Rex Ryan informed the media on Tuesday, via the Buffalo News . \"He's excused for personal reasons.\"\nOn Thursday Ryan was asked about Harvin's absence again.\n\"I'm not going to say any more on [Harvin] than [Wednesday,]\" he said , \"because I don't know where he is right now.\"\nHarvin, according to NFL Media's Ian Rapoport , is at home dealing with his hip injury.\nWhat does Percy Harvin's future hold? All options are on the table. He's out a while. The question is: Will his hip allow him to play again?\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) October 22, 2015 NFL Media's Conor Orr, citing a Bills source , added that retirement is \"absolutely on the table\" for Harvin. However, according to Adam Schefter , the 27-year-old former Florida Gator is just frustrated with his nagging knee and hip injuries but \"not considering retirement\" at the moment.\nHarvin missed a total of 10 games in his first three NFL seasons -- all with the Vikings -- before suffering a labrum tear in his hip after being traded to the Seahawks in 2013. The injury kept him out of 15 games that year, and another three the following season, in the midst of which Seattle traded him to the Jets . Harvin signed a one-year deal with the Bills in March, but he's missed multiple practices due to the hip and didn't play Week 6 against the Bengals .\nHarvin, who was named a first-team All Pro in 2009, has caught 19 balls for 218 yards and one touchdown this season, his first in Buffalo.\nThe Bills will also be without starting quarterback Tyrod Taylor and wide receiver Sammy Watkins on Sunday.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/71506/percy-harvin", "https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/657179009747283968", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/cincinnati-bengals", "https://twitter.com/ConorOrr", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/new-york-jets", "https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/657180415044800512", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/131481/tyrod-taylor", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/minnesota-vikings", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/seattle-seahawks", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/253743/rex-ryan", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/buffalo-bills", "http://sbnation.com?utm_source=MSNbanner/", "http://bills.buffalonews.com/2015/10/22/bills-harvin-contemplating-retirement/", "https://bills.buffalonews.com/2015/10/21/wr-percy-harvin-not-in-uk-for-personal-reasons/", "https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/657180127437131776", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/teams/jacksonville-jaguars", "http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/players/245647/sammy-watkins"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:22:07.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
