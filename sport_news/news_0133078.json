Comment Cheboygan Daily Tribune - Cheboygan, MI Writer Posted Oct. 19, 2015 at 9:58 PM Posted Oct. 19, 2015 at 9:58 PM Rudyard, Mich. RUDYARD — Cheboygan sophomore Max Paull posted another strong finish, racing a time of 18:12 to finish in second place overall at the Rudyard Invitational on Saturday. Also for Cheboygan, which finished second in the Big School Division, Griffin White (19:55) finished 24th, Anthony Steiner (20:02) took 25th, Zachary Miller (21:38) went 42nd, Jacob Pettyjohn (22:00) was 47th, and Dylan Coppernoll (24:22) posted 54th. The times by Steiner, Miller and Pettyjohn were each personal records. For the Cheboygan girls, who took third in the Big School Division, Kaylie McCumby (23:30) led the way with a 17th-place finish, while Miranda Brake (24:47) took 27th. Jasmine Steiner (33rd, 25:11), Brenna Whitaker (46th, 27:32), Tabatha Peariso (48th, 28:15) and Jada Mosher (52nd, 32:31) also raced in the meet. Cheboygan cross country coach Sandy Safford was pleased by the performance of both varsity squads. “Our team did very well today. We ran in snow and cold. We had four runners take home medals in the top 25. Kaylie McCumby, Max Paull, Griffin White, and Anthony Steiner. That was very exciting. We still have some runners dealing with sickness,” said Safford. “(Max) Paull ran a great race once again and keeps having steady times. He still wants to break below sub-18, and he has the ability to be as great as he wants to be. Griffin (White) did not have his best race because he didn’t feel 100 percent, but he helped pace Anthony Steiner to have his best of the season. Steiner was thrilled to knock another 23 seconds off his best time of the season. Zachary Miller ran over to us after the race with a huge smile on his face. He knew he had ran well and he beat his previous best today on a more difficult course. Jacob Pettyjohn again had his personal record by two seconds. He looks much stronger than his first race of the year. “Our girls continue to improve, but we did not have any girls have their best time of the season in this race. The ground was slick with snow and it was more of a challenge for those who had their best race. Kaylie McCumby looks strong in the front for our team, but we need to work on our girls pushing up in the pack each race.” In the middle school race, Cody Jewell finished in sixth placed and Mason Whitaker tallied eighth to lead the Cheboygan boys to second place out of 10 teams on Saturday. For the Cheboygan Middle School girls, who finished eighth, Kassidy Tohm took 15th place. Cheboygan’s home invitational has been rescheduled for Tuesday, Oct. 27, at 3:30 p.m. at the Black Mountain location across from The Bluffs on Black Lake.
