The two-bedroom, two-bath home sits atop a 150-foot volcanic cone on a 60-acre plot located in Newberry Springs, CA which is about 32-miles east of Barstow. The 1800-square-foot home was designed and built by architect Harold J. Bissner Jr. in 1968. LEONARD ORTIZ, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Related article » RELATED TWENTYNINE PALMS: Huell Howser home available for special events CASSIE MACDUFF: Huell Howser's cameraman writing a book The Volcano House, a flying-saucer shaped home atop a 150-foot cinder cone in the Mojave Desert, has sold for $750,000, the listing agent said Thursday, Oct. 1.\nThere was no immediate word on who the buyer is, or his or her intended use for the property.\nChapman University, which owned the home, received three offers at or above the $650,000 list price, Brady Sandahl of HOM Sotheby's International Realty said last month.\nThe property hit the market Sept. 3. Huell Howser, the producer and host of the TV show \"California's Gold,\" gave the iconic house, which sits on 60 acres, to Chapman University in 2012. He died a year later.\nSandahl said he and another agent listing the house considered other “architecturally significant” properties, mostly in the high desert, in coming up with the $650,000 price tag.\n\"We did go on the market at an appropriate value, and the market responded immediately with multiple offers,\" he said in September.\nThose interested in the property were prompted by different reasons, he said.\nOne prospective buyer had a thing for \"rooflines,\" Sandhal said, noting the home's round, spaceship shape. Another was interested in the 60 acres, with an iconic house in the mix.\n\"Another buyer wanted to own the house because there's nothing else like it in the world,\" the agent said.\nThe university had said it would use the house for desert studies, astronomy and geology pursuits. But the home's remote location in Newberry Springs, east of Bartstow, proved too impractical for the school.\n\"It's pretty isolated out there,\" Chapman spokeswoman Mary Platt said when the house went on the market. \"It’s just too far away for us. There's no support services for students as far as safety and that kind of thing.\"\nAnnette Short of Barstow Real Estate Group was co-listing the home.\nAll proceeds from the Volcano House sale will go to the California’s Gold Scholarship fund set up by Howser, Platt said. �", "external_links": ["http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvk61o-volchouse.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvk631-volchouse2.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvk61o-volchouse.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvk631-volchouse2.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:04:28.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
