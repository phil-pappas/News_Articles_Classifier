San Jose is in Santa Clara County, part of the San Francisco Giants' territory under MLB's constitution. The city said the territory rules violated federal antitrust laws. Baseball has been exempt from antitrust laws since a 1922 Supreme Court decision.\nThe case is San Jose v. Major League Baseball, 14-1252.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
