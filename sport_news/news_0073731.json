Barrett appears to be the quarterback now, based on the way the game played out, him going from red-zone specialist to man for all occasions late in the third quarter on Saturday night against Penn State. The defense was ripped again by the running game, but it made the stops when needed, especially Tommy Schutt on a sack with 10 minutes to play. Meanwhile, the Ezekiel Elliott’s 100 yards-plus streak moved to 12 games.\n>> Got a question about Ohio State football? Ask the experts! \nObvious stars Barrett, who finished all three early touchdown drives, took the Buckeyes on the clinching 85-yard drive in starting with 10 minutes left, capping it with a Tim Tebow-like jump pass of five yards to Braxton Miller for the TD, upping the lead to 31-10 with 6:25 left. Elliott was at 153 yards rushing heading into the last 6:28. Defensive Joey Bosa was a force all night, gaining a sack along the way. But the sack to remember was provided by Schutt on fourth and 2 from the OSU 13. He grabbed PSU quarterback Christian Hackenberg’s right foot and didn’t let go, giving OSU the ball with 10 minutes to play.\n>> Get the most out of your Ohio State experience, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \nUnsung workers When linebacker Joshua Perry had to leave because of an ankle injury early in the first quarter, Dante Booker entered and saw his first extensive action as a collegian. Carmen Williams also rolled into the rotation with starters Raekwon McMillan and Darron Lee as the game progressed. The offensive line perked up when Barrett was in the game, the threat of the option stunting somewhat the marauding of PSU defensive end Carl Nassib.\nStrategically speaking Did folks see a changing of the guard at quarterback? Urban Meyer went in with Cardale Jones as the starter and Barrett as the inside-the-red-zone man, just like the previous week. But when OSU got the ball at its 25 with 3:18 left in the third quarter, Barrett went in at QB. He had already led the team to three red-zone touchdowns while the Buckeyes struggled for consistency under Jones.\nExposed The Ohio State run defense, which was gashed by quarterbacks the previous two games but run on a by a bonafide running back, Saquon Barkley, last night. Barkley had 133 yards on 21 carries through three quarters, and had a long would-be TD jaunt called back because of a holding penalty.\n>> Click for details on how to win tickets and trips to OSU games from  Dispatch  Reader Rewards \nStat that matters 268 yards rushing – Ohio State had amassed that 6:25 to go in the game. PSU had entered 26th nationally in rush defense (117.0 avg.).\nInjury report Linebacker Joshua Perry suffered an ankle injury on the defense’s second play, was examined on the sideline and then carted to the locker room. Meanwhile, linebacker Camren Williams was cited for targeting on a hit late in the fourth quarter and was ejected. He will miss the game at Rutgers on Saturday.\nBy the numbers 27 — Ohio State’s regular-season Big Ten winning streak.\n4 — Straight wins for Buckeyes over PSU, going to 17-13 in the series.\nNext step The Buckeyes travel to Rutgers for another prime-time game that likely won’t grab as much attention. The big question is whether there will be an official change of starting quarterback, as Saturday night’s results would indicate is imminent. And of course, there will be the watching of polls today, to see whether voters opt to push Baylor ahead of the top-ranked Buckeyes.\ntmay@dispatch.com \n@TIM_MAYsports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:35:55.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
