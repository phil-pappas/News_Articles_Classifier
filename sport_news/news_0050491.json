When he did this, he breached the 'One-Ball Condition',\" said Russell. \n\n\"In this situation, the penalty for breach of this condition is a one-hole adjustment to the state of the match. \n\n\"The USA side lost the seventh hole, making the International side one up. At this point, the adjustment penalty of one hole is applied, resulting in the International side being two up through seven holes.\" \n\nIn effect, the US 'lost' the hole twice. \n\nRussell admitted that Mickelson could have continued on the hole but was advised he was disqualified from it by the rules committee in discussion with the match referee Gary Young. \n\n\"Okay. I accept total responsibility for that mistake,\" Russell said, \n\nHe added he could not remember ever a situation where a pair lost two holes while playing only one. \"I can't (remember that happening). We don't play fourball match play very often. You know, it's a strange situation.\" \n\nUS captain Jay Haas said the issue was over. \"It's just unfortunate that he was told he had to pick up the ball,\" Haas told reporters. \n\n\"Had he been able to play out and make a four and tie the hole, then it would only have been one down instead of two down. \n\n\"We talked to Mark Russell, and they (rules committee) acknowledged that it was their error, but again, there's nothing to be done.\" \n\nMickelson remained upbeat, said Haas, despite his error. \n\n\"He said: 'All right, we got it, no problem, we're going to work it out. It was my mistake.' He was not angry,\" said Haas. \n\n\"He wasn't angry at himself. Just, 'Hey, rookie mistake, my fault captain, we'll get it back'.\" \n\nThe ruling had competitors, watching media and spectators alike scratching their heads. \n\nGolf fans and even professionals were quick to take to social media to criticise the game's plethora of obscure rules, which run to more than 600 pages, and can have marked differences between the usual professional stroke play format and match play seen in Presidents and Ryder Cups. \n\n\"How can you lose a hole twice???! #ussgarules #wow,\" tweeted former US team member Keegan Bradley. \n\nOne Twitter user, Ari Marcus, said: \"So apparently you can lose a hole twice now... How can any match be closed out early now? I.E. How can you lose 2&1 if this is possible?\" \n\nAnother, Matt Blackly, tweeted: \"Yet again the rules of golf are as clear as mud and destined to turn people away from the game! #Simplify it.\" Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:54:21.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
