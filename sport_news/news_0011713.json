(Photo: Courtesy of Fort Valley State) \nFlorida Tech’s football team hits the road this week to face the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Conference leader Fort Valley State in a regional matchup. \nFort Valley State comes into the game 4-2 overall but all four wins have been in the conference as they welcome the Panthers to Georgia Saturday night. \nThe Wildcats have done it with an aggressive Man Front style defense that has recorded 19 sacks and 46 tackles for loss in the first six games. The leader of the group has been Stefon Harper, who has three sacks and eight tackles for loss. Leon McQuarker leads the team in tackles with 44 and has two sacks on the season. \n“We are aggressive,” Fort Valley State head coach Donald Pittman said by phone this week. “We have a number of good defensive linemen and rotate them in quite often. No truly great players but together they can be.” \nOn offense, it begins with their quarterbacks and they have two good ones that they use. Otis Brown and Malcolm Eady have split time under center giving the Wildcats a potent 1-2 punch. \nThe duo’s favorite targets are Jevon Bell and Drelon Freeman, who have each scored four touchdowns this season and average over 12 yards per catch. \nBrown has thrown for 650 yards and rushed for another 164 yards while Eady is more of the dropback passer, throwing for 483 yards and eight touchdowns. \n“They are both back from last year, so we play both and they are some good quarterbacks for us,” Pittman said. “I think that has been the key to our start, the passing game and we are just beginning to gel as a team.” \nAfter a slow start to the season against Delta State, Fort Valley State has averaged 34 points per game and is 4-1 with the loss coming against Alderson Broaddus, who the Panthers beat in the ECAC Futures Bowl in their first season. \nSaturday’s game is the final non-conference game for Fort Valley State and coach Pittman knows it will be a big challenge. \n“They have talent, are strong in all three phases,” Pittman said. “We haven’t won a conference title in a long time and playing a team like Florida Tech will get us ready for that, as far as speed and physical play.” 1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.flatoday.com/1LwKSCZ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:11:03.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
