St. Mary’s Colgan took advantage of several Humboldt turnovers early to earn a road win against the Cubs, 31-8, Friday evening in the second week of district play. The Panthers scored on the first play of the game and added a pair of touchdowns off two Cubs’ turnovers to push their lead to 14 at the half. Colgan drove down the field out of the locker room and scored a touchdown to take the momentum for the remainder of the game. With the win, SMC moves to 6-2 on the season. They are 2-0 in district play and have all but clinched a spot in the playoffs. St. Mary’s Colgan started the game off with fireworks as SMC quarterback Ryan Cedeno dropped back on the first play from scrimmage and slung the ball to tight end Garrett Normand, who took the ball upfield 65 yards to find pay dirt with a defender on his back the final 10 yards of the score. Moments later, Colgan’s Connor O’Brien intercepted a Humboldt tipped pass for the game’s first turnover. Colgan's offense capitalized on the takeaway to push the Panther lead to double digits. Joe Battitori started the second SMC drive off with a 13-yard run before Andrew Stewart added 24 more yards on the ground to get down inside the Humboldt 2. On third and goal, Cedeno scored his second touchdown of the game, taking the ball up the middle across the goal like to make the score 13-0 with less than five minutes coming off the clock. Just as it looked like the game was slipping away from Humboldt early in the first quarter, the Cubs got a 65-yard run from running back Bryce Isaac to bring his team down inside the SMC 1. Two plays later, Humboldt fullback Rhett Smith scored a touchdown. A successful two-point conversion made the score 13-8 with 4:54 left in the first quarter. Later in the first half, the Panthers forced a fumble with the Cubs in the red zone as Normand scooped the ball and scored a long touchdown run. After a successful two-point conversion for SMC, Colgan led Humboldt 21-8. Kyle Steinmiller pushed the Panther lead over the Cubs to 24-8 following his 25-yard field goal with less than a minute to play in the second quarter. SMC’s Sawyer Esch ended the first half with an interception when the Cubs tried to push the ball down field in hopes of a response to the SMC touchdown. The Panthers came out of the second half and marched down the field to assert themselves with the momentum. Cedeno scored his third touchdown of the game on a 2-yard keeper to put SMC on top of Humboldt, 31-8. Page 2 of 2 - With the Cubs threatening on their ensuing drive, Normand fell on a loose ball to give the ball back to Colgan, tallying the fourth turnover of the game for Humboldt and ending any opportunity of getting back in the game. Colgan held serve and kept the Cubs off the scoreboard on the way to the win. Lucas Davis is the sports editor of the Pittsburg Morning Sun.
