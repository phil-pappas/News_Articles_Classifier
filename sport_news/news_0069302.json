Related Links Seneca’s Simon runs wild in win against Reed-Custer \nThough Seneca, now 2-6 overall, went three-and-out on its opening series, Tyler Draine recovered a fumble of the resultant punt to give the Irish another try. Peter Hogue turned the turnover into points by making a 32-yard field goal. \nThe 3-0 lead lasted for all of 14 seconds of game time, as Plano's Elijah Maisonet returned the kickoff it produced 85 yards for a touchdown. The Reapers then forced another Irish punt and were in the end zone again four Jay Winter runs later. Winter's was the second of six straight touchdowns scored by the Reapers, who missed a chance at a running clock when their two-point pass attempt fell incomplete with the score 41-3 late in the third quarter. \nGiven the chance to extend the game, the Irish did just that. Casey Pifer had a 4-yard touchdown run early in the fourth, and Draine added scoring runs of 5 and 78 yards in the final minutes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:15:03.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
