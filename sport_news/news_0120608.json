Ahead of Max Pacioretty, Jamie Benn and P.K. Subban.\nExpectations were high when Edmonton drafted the London, Ontario, native. In his eight years in the league, however, he hasn't come close to those lofty heights.\nHe has been consistent - scoring between 10 and 18 goals each season - but he has put up mostly pedestrian numbers.\nMore coverage Download FREE Philly Sports Now app for iPhone! Buy Flyers jerseys and other gear Forum: Did Flyers make right moves in offseason? Latest hockey odds At 26 and playing in the final year of his contract - and wanting to prove his ex-general manger wrong - there isn't a better time for a breakout season.\n\"This is an important year to try and do that,\" Gagner said early in training camp. \"I think if I can take care of my job and make sure I'm doing the right things, then I can help move the team forward in the playoffs. That's my mind-set.\"\nBut Gagner has had a mediocre camp and, based on the lines that were used in Saturday's practice, there's a chance he will be a healthy scratch in Thursday's opener in Tampa.\n\"If he is out, that doesn't mean that he's not going to be an important part of the team,\" rookie coach Dave Hakstol said.\nThe Flyers want the 5-foot-11, 202-pound Gagner to play with more of an edge.\n\"I think Sam's been OK,\" general manager Ron Hextall said. \"He's had some good moments and some decent moments and not-so-great moments, probably like most of our guys. It's preseason and you're playing some of the kinks out. I think his skill level is high, and where he ends up, that's Hak's decision. But I'm not disappointed in him.\"\nWhen Gagner was acquired from Arizona in the Nick Grossmann trade in June, Coyotes general manager Don Maloney was blunt.\n\"We didn't think he could play center at the National Hockey League level for us,\" he said.\nGagner, whose dad, Dave, scored 318 goals in a distinguished NHL career, is well aware of Maloney's assessment. He said he had a \"lot of people to prove wrong\" and that he was as \"motivated as you can get.\"\n\"I'm not going to let the comments of one person define me as a player,\" Gagner said. \"I think I have another level I can get to, but I still feel I've shown a lot of things in the past to give me confidence going forward. I'm going to continue to draw on those things, and continue to try to push myself to try and get better. I'm ready for the challenge here.\"\nGagner came into camp in great shape, and he was used at both wings and at center during preseason games. The Flyers are leaning toward using him at wing - when he does crack their lineup.\n\"My timing is getting better as we go along,\" Gagner said. \"Hopefully when the season starts, I'm firing on all cylinders.\"\nGagner became a first-time father Aug. 19, when his son, Cooper, was born. He called it a life-changing event.\n\"I'm getting a little less sleep than I'm used to,\" said Gagner, smiling. \"It gives you a fresh perspective. He becomes your world and he's all you ever think of. Regardless of what happens on the ice, it makes you realize the most important thing in life is your family. Cooper's really shown me that.\"\nscarchidi@phillynews.com\n@BroadStBull", "external_links": ["http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=article&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2FNHL_Philadelphia_Flyers"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:39:12.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
