Click to close Fremd, Barrington hope to restore order in unpredictable MSL West Purchase Photo | Barrington and quarterback Johnny Davidson, here scoring against Conant in Week 6, will be looking for a bounce-back effort against Fremd on Friday in a key Mid-Suburban West matchup. Joe Lewnard | Staff Photographer Dick Quagliano \nIn the wild, wild West, anything could happen. And it's playing out a lot like that in the Mid-Suburban West football race this year. \nAll six teams are within a game of the conference lead. Barrington, Conant and Palatine are all 2-1 while Fremd, Schaumburg and Hoffman Estates are 1-2 with two games remaining in the regular season. Story Continues Below \nAnd with conference titles and playoff spots on the line, it could be a battle reminiscent of the OK Corral when Barrington hosts Fremd on Friday night. \n\"There is always a lot on the line between the two programs,\" said Barrington coach Joe Sanchez, who won his 100th career game two weeks ago when his team beat Conant 40-34. \"Whether is the conference race or the playoffs, there is a lot at stake when Barrington and Fremd play.\" \nFremd coach Lou Sponsel, who is in his fourth season, concurs: \"Our communities like to compete against each other.\" \nBoth Fremd and Barrington come in a bit scarred after each lost last week. Barrington (6-1) fell for the second consecutive year to Palatine, 26-24, while Fremd (4-2 overall) was upended by Hoffman Estates 25-24 in overtime. \nBarrington has won the last two meetings between the Broncos and Fremd, and 3 of the last 4. But in the last decade, Fremd has posted a 7-3 mark. \n\"We expect it to be just like all the other games we have played against them,\" Sanchez said. \"It will be a tough, physical game and both teams are looking to execute well.\" \nBarrington has won 16 of its last 19 games under quarterback Johnny Davidson, who is garnering attention from St. Xavier. Davidson has completed an astounding 75.4 percent of his passes (95-of-126) for 1,286 yards and 14 touchdown passes. He has thrown just 3 interceptions and has rushed for 557 yards and 7 touchdowns. \nDavidson gets to line up behind an offensive line that features a pair of Division I prospects in 6-foot-3, 285-pound Alex Serrano, who is a senior, and 6-3, 290-pound Nick Bart, who is a junior. \nFremd counters with a pair of Division I players of its own in Michigan State-bound defensive back Kenny Lyke and defensive end Matt McCabe, who is headed to Yale. \nThe injury bug has caught up with Fremd a bit with WR/DB Cordell Finley, who has been getting some D-I looks, out for the season with a broken foot. Lyke has also been banged up, but is expected to play this week -- along with a couple of other Vikings who had been nursing bumps and bruises. \n\"It will help getting Kenny back this week,\" Sponsel said. \"Having Kenny back and with the other guys stepping up, we hope to bounce back this week.\" Get great articles like this sent to your inbox!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:21:45.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
