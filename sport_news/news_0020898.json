The Hornets played the LA Clippers in Shanghai on Wednesday. It is the 20th NBA game in China. \n“We wanted to demonstrate to everyone in China that our commitment was a broad one,” Silver said. “It’s not just about the NBA, but growing the game here. I believe that we’ve just scratched the surface of basketball’s popularity in China.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:30:44.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
