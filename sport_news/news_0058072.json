will not be replaced Blatter, Platini suspended from soccer by FIFA's ethics body Platini called French sports ministry to insist he's clean Sheikh Salman weighs entering FIFA race if Platini withdraws Platini has more explaining to do, German league chief INTERVIEW: Platini has \"clear conscience\" over FIFA payment UEFA chief Michel Platini has appealed against a 90-day ban slapped on him over an ongoing corruption probe, as FIFA gears up for a crunch meeting over its raging sleaze crisis.\nThe news comes a day after FIFA president Sepp Blatter also launched an appeal against a similar 90-day ban from all football-related activities over a Swiss criminal inquiry.\nThe bans on Blatter and Platini -- the two most powerful men in world football -- were announced by FIFA on Thursday as its ethics watchdog geared up its investigation into fraud and corruption at the heart of the organisation.\nThe 60-year-old Platini, a frontrunner to succeed Blatter as chief of football's scandal-tainted world governing body, denies any wrongdoing in taking a $2 million payment from FIFA in 2011.\nThe former France skipper has slammed the ban as \"farcical\", insisting the payment was legitimate, and on Saturday a close associate said an official appeal had been lodged at FIFA's Zurich headquarters.\nMuch now hangs on a crunch October 20 meeting of FIFA's ruling executive committee -- announced late on Friday following pressure from influential regional and national federations.\nThe fate of the election to replace Blatter -- slated for February 26 -- could depend on the summit, with some senior FIFA figures suggested the committee could debate postponing the vote.\nInterim FIFA president Issa Hayatou, who Friday insisted ongoing health problems would not stop him doing the high-pressure job, is rushing from his native Cameroon to take the reins at FIFA HQ and is expected in Zurich on Tuesday.\nThe dramatic suspension of Blatter and Platini along with FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke was the latest blow to an organisation reeling from months of scandal.\nThe crisis has been building since May, when US authorities announced charges against 14 officials and sports marketing executives over bribery allegations amounting to more than $150 million.\n- Appeals -\nThe suspensions handed out on Thursday can be renewed for another 45 days when they run out in January, which would take the exclusion until just before the FIFA election.\nShould either Blatter or Platini see their appeal rejected, they would still have the right to take their cases before the final-instance Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), based in Lausanne.\nAdding to the controversy, Thursday's purge by the ethics committee also felled South Korean tycoon Chung Mong-Joon -- like Platini a candidate to replace Blatter -- who was banned from football activities for six years.\nFurious Chung has vowed to sue FIFA and take his case to CAS.\nThere was further drama on Friday as the ethics committee rejected Blatter's claims he was not allowed to give evidence before he was banned, saying he was given \"all his rights\".\nThere were reports the 79-year-old Blatter, head of FIFA since 1998, had complained that he only found out about his suspension after it was made public.\nBut ethics committee spokesman Andreas Bantel said Blatter had been given the chance to put his case on October 1.\nPlatini also \"had the very same rights\" at an interview on the same day, Bantel said.\nThe former Juventus star had presented himself as the man to clean up FIFA but a cloud now hangs over his candidacy, though he insists he will press on with his bid for Blatter's hotseat.\nHe was named in a Swiss probe into Blatter for criminal mismanagement over the $2 million payment which Platini says was payment for consulting work he undertook years earlier.\nBut his candidacy still needs to come under the microscope of FIFA's elections commission who will examine his suitability.\nBlatter, who decided to quit in June just days after being reelected, has so far resisted calls from major sponsors including Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Visa for him to step down immediately.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled":
