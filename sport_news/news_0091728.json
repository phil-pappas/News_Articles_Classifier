Posted Oct. 21, 2015 at 5:46 PM Updated at 6:14 PM Posted Oct. 21, 2015 at 5:46 PM Updated at 6:14 PM When Javien Elliott arrived in Tallahassee as a preferred walk-on in the spring semester of 2014, there was no reason to expect him to make much of an impression. The former Rutherford Ram was a full-time student at Gulf Coast before going to FSU, having last played organized football during his senior season of high school in 2010. But after spending the year on the Seminoles’ scout team, Elliott earned a scholarship at the end of fall practice this year, and has since made an impact in his limited field time. Elliott forced a fumble in his first action of the season in FSU’s opening 59-16 win over Texas State, and he flashed again with an interception of Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson in the third quarter of a 41-21 victory over the Cardinals. While the 5-foot-11, 176-pound backup defensive back may have been unknown to most Seminole fans before this season, it didn’t take FSU coach Jimbo Fisher long to take notice of Elliott after arriving on campus. “From the first time he walked over there,” the coach said during Wednesday’s ACC Media Teleconference. “He started covering our guys and I’m like, ‘Are our guys not running? What’s going on?’ He was competing very hard from the first day he walked over. We said, ‘this guy’s not normal.’ He’s competing his tail off and he’s got ability. This is a guy. We’ll see if it keeps going for the next day and the next day and it did. He caught our eye.” Elliott has appeared in five of the Seminoles’ six games this season, registering four solo tackles and one pass defended to go with the forced fumble and the interception. From that first spring practice throughout his season on the scout team, Fisher said that Elliott showed a great aptitude for accepting coaching and transferring it onto the practice field to get the starters ready for their next opponent. “He’s over there covering guys on scout team, making reads, doing what he’s supposed to do, but playing them real tough,” he said. “We tell our (scout team) guys to give (the starters) a game look. Make them work hard. Don’t make it easy on them. Make those guys better and he did it. This guy was running right with them and contesting balls and contesting throws. He just caught my eye.” After Saturday’s game, Elliott talked about his transition to life as a scholarship player and how he has tried to maintain the same attitude and hunger that got him off the scout team in the first place. Page 2 of 2 - “Being a scholarship player is a blessing,” he said. “At the same time, I still have that hunger on the inside of me like I’m still a walk-on. I try not to let it go to my head. I’m proud to be on scholarship, but I still work every day like I’m a walk-on.” Elliott played three varsity seasons for Rutherford from 2008-10 but received very little college interest after his senior season and thought his football career might be over. Getting from that point to now making impact plays for a nationally-ranked Division-I football program is a journey that Fisher said he wasn’t sure anyone has fully appreciated. “To walk on here, play on the scout team, earn a scholarship, and then go out there and make plays on special teams and be ready to play when your number is called (is great),” he said. “I don’t think we appreciated how hard it is what that young man has done. There’s an example.” FSU (6-0, 4-0 in the ACC) next plays Saturday against Georgia Tech in Atlanta.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:59:01.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
