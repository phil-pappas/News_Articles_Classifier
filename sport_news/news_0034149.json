These weren’t just players; they were sisters, daughters, and student athletes who were going to make something special out of their lives. \nBrooke Deckard, Meagan Richardson, Jaiden Pelton and Katelyn Woodlee are four members of the NCTC Lady Lions softball team that I’ll never have the opportunity to watch play, or have a chance to learn about as people during my time here in Gainesville. \nBut something I do have the chance to do is continue to tell the stories of the teammates they helped inspire, along with the legacy they have left behind as Lady Lion softball players. \nNow, you’re probably asking yourself, where does the University of Oklahoma fit into all of this? \nOU was one of the first programs that reached out to NCTC assistant coach Taylor Christian and the Lady Lions following this tragic accident to offer anything they possibly could to help these student athletes get through this very difficult time not only as a program, but as human beings. \nIt would have been so easy for the Sooners and head coach Patty Gasso to ignore such an incident, or to make sure their actions were made public for their own benefit. \nNeither of these happened. \nNot only did coach Gasso and her husband Jim visit the NCTC players in the hospital, she offered up the use of the OU facilities, and anything else the Lady Lions and their families might need during this difficult time. \nOU alumni Lauren Chamberlain has even gone as far as to keep in touch with the Lady Lions to this day, always making sure they are doing alright and being strong, and was even a guest coach in the NCTC alumni softball game, which raised more than $19,000 for the Angels in the Infield scholarship fund last year. \nBut, it wasn’t just OU that reached out to provide comfort to the Lady Lions. \nNumerous other programs, including Southern Nazarene University, the team NCTC played on the night of the accident, was constantly making sure things were alright with anyone and everyone involved. \nEven members of the Texas Rangers baseball team paid a visit to bring a little bit of comfort to the Lady Lions just a few short months ago at Darwin Field. \nNo one would have blamed NCTC for not playing the 2015 spring season, but they rallied together as a family, and took the field. Everyone knew the story, and everyone knew the Lady Lions were playing for their “Angels in the Infield.” \nThe wins and losses counted throughout the season, but in the grand scheme of things, NCTC had already won by taking the field every game no matter what the score turned out to be. \nFast forward to this past Wednesday night at Marita Hynes Field, when NCTC took the field in an exhibition game against the Sooners, just a few short weeks following the one year anniversary of the tragic accident. \nNot only was it fitting that OU would be the team the Lady Lions would share a pregame and postgame prayer with on the field before playing them, but Lauren Chamberlain was the person to throw out the first pitch on the mound. \nAlso hanging in crimson and cream on the left center field wall, was a special banner made in dedication to the four NCTC players lost on that night, along with the phrase “22 Strong.” \nThere were also numerous former NCTC softball players who made the trips from their respective universities to sit in the dugout and be a part of the experience along with their former teammates and coaches. \nAnd to top it all off, following the game, members of the Southern Nazarene University softball team gave the Lady Lion players bracelets they had made as a special gift. \nThings came full circle for the NCTC program on this night, a huge step in the right direction towards a continuous process of healing and strength. \nSome people might ask why I would choose to add NCTC to an already full plate of high schools to cover as part of my job. \nThe answer is simple: These student athletes have just as many stories to tell as any high school athlete, and their contributions on the field are just as important as the ones they will make off the field. Wherever they go, they will forever be associated with NCTC, just like any high school student will forever claim their school as alumni. \nThese current Lady Lion softball players and their coaches are a family. A family that has gone through tragedy, but has stuck together and is moving forward one day at a time. \nAs the band Skillet said in their song “Rise,” “When the scars heal, the pain passes. The smoke burns, we rise from the ashes.” \nNCTC has and will continue to rise not just as an athletic institution, but as a school. \nAnd wherever they go, the Sooners, Crimson Storm, Rangers, and thousands of other family members will be there every step of the way, including four guardian angels.
