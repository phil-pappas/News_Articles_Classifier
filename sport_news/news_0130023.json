A division Bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Jayant Patel and NV Anjaria refused to grant stay on the execution of the order pending before the Supreme Court and lambasted the state Election Commission for toeing the ruling BJP’s line that the law and order situation was not conducive for the free and fair poll. The high court order follows two writ petitions challenging the October 4 ordinance to postpone the elections in the state because of law and order concerns in the wake of the four-month-old agitation by the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) demanding reservation for the Patel community under the Other Backward Classes (OBC) category. During the hearing last week, the High Court had ridiculed the state poll panel’s decision to put off the polls saying that if the elections could be held in the terror-infested J&K, why should not be in Gujarat. “The condition in Gujarat is surely not worse than J&K,” the Bench had stated. State Congress leader Shaktisinh Gohil, who had appeared on behalf of the petitioners, had alleged that the Anandiben Patel government was deliberately trying to delay the elections fearing an electoral backlash from the Patel community. The poll panel had earlier promised to take necessary steps for conducting the local elections in December, but the High Court in its order today asked it to start preparations immediately. The terms of six municipal corporations, 56 municipalities, 31 district panchayats and more than 230 taluka panchayats are expiring by the middle of the next month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:00:20.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
