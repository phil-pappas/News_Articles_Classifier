We can’t allow one game to be bigger than the other. Do we realize the type of player we’re playing against? Yes, we do. But you don’t change. We’ve got to be 1-0 this week, regardless of who it is – Brady – regardless of who we’re playing.” ( USA Today )\nMarcus Smart looks poised to break out: “The second-year guard scored seven points and tied his regular season career-high with nine assists in a team-high 27 minutes, all while matching up against the Knicks’ regulars. The 21-year-old was in complete command of Boston’s offense both in the halfcourt and on the break, repeatedly setting up his teammates for easy looks.” ( Boston.com )\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below Playing both sides: These guys have worn Patriots and Jets colors: “The bitter rivals have the same division, coastline, and interstate (I-95).
