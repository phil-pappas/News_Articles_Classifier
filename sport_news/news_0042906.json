It becomes very difficult to preserve the body for such a long duration. This service will come as a relief to many such families who live far or abroad and want to see their loved ones for one last time,\" Patel said.\nVMC would be purchasing four AC coffins initially to launch this free service, which will be linked to the fire brigade through a helpline number. The coffin will be made available to the needy on request, said Municipal Commissioner H S Patel.\n\"After every use, the coffin will be thoroughly disinfected so that the handles remain free of any infection.\nThe AC coffin will be available to poor and rich alike.\nNo fee will be charged for this facility,\" he said.\nAccording to City Mayor, Bharat Shah it is difficult to keep bodies preserved in soaring temperatures, especially during summers but these refrigerated boxes will help people retain the bodies for a couple of days.\n\"The 2.5x 7 ft AC coffin will preserve bodies at low temperatures and can be easily operated at home. Each of these electricity-run refrigerated boxes will cost us about Rs 2-3 lakhs,\" said Dr Devesh M Patel, Chief Medical Officer of VMC.\nThe usage of AC coffins is popular in Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore.
