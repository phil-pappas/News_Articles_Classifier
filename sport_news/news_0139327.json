He is particularly important with Lionel Messi expected to be sidelined until late November with an injured left knee. \nArgentina fell to Chile three months ago in the Copa America final, and lost the World Cup final last year against Germany. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:09:17.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
