The Rebels forced a fumble after punting back to the Spartans and four plays later scored on an Andrew Price 25-yard touchdown reception. \nAfter forcing a Spartan punt, the Rebels came right back to score a touchdown, taking a 24-20 lead. The Spartans came back to take the lead on a touchdown, leading 27-24. The Rebels came out slinging, kicking in a field goal to tie the game and forcing overtime. \nThe Spartans won the toss and deferred to go second, which proved to be critical. The Rebels were unable to get a first down and settled for a field goal attempt that was blocked by Isaiah Irving. On the ensuing Spartan possession, they gave it to their dominant running back, Tyler Ervin, four times, and he found the end zone for the 33-27 overtime victory. \nThe Spartans (3-3, 2-1) prepare for the Aztecs next week as the Rebels (2-4, 1-1) will travel to Fresno to take on the Bulldogs. \nThe Aggies (3-2, 2-0) went into Fresno and dominated the Bulldogs (1-5, 0-3) 56-14. \nHere are the results from the other four games in the Mountain West: \nNo. 25 Boise State (5-1, 2-0) 41, Colorado State (2-4, 0-2) 10 \nThe Broncos, once again, dominated in conference play. They were led by quarterback Brett Rypien, who finished the night 22-25 for 339 yards passing and a touchdown. Running back Jeremy McNichols has a solid game with 17 carries for 104 yards and two touchdowns, and wide receiver Thomas Sperbeck had five receptions for 178 yards and two touchdowns as well. The Broncos were back to their ways of trickery as wide receiver Shane Williams-Rhodes threw a 53-yard touchdown to Sperbeck. \nThe Broncos will take their undefeated conference record to Logan to play the also undefeated Aggies in conference play, and the Rams will host the Falcons. \nNevada (3-3, 1-1) 35, New Mexico (3-3, 1-1) 17 \nNevada quarterback Tyler Stewart had a solid day throwing the ball, going 16-19 for 1 \nWolf Pack running back Don Jackson had a great day, finishing 22 carries for 152 yards rushing, and wide receiver Jerico Richardson played well, catching nine balls for 121 yards and a touchdown. \nOther than the fumble return for the touchdown, not much went well for the Lobos. The only bright spot offensively for the Lobos was running back Teriyon Gipson, who finished with 11 carries for 68 yards and a touchdown. \nThe Lobos will host the Warriors in Week 7 as the Wolf Pack will travel to Wyoming to take on the Cowboys. \nAir Force (3-3, 2-0) 31, Wyoming (0-6, 0-2) 17 \nThe Falcons' dominant rushing attack was on display again Saturday as they combined for 299 yards rushing and three touchdowns. The Falcons were led by junior running back Shayne Davern, who finished with 13 carries for 130 yards and two touchdowns. \nSan Diego State (3-3, 2-0) 28, Hawaii (2-4, 0-2) 14 \nThe Aztecs ran the ball down the throat of the Warrior defense in Week 6. Running back Donnel Pumphrey ran wild, finishing with 30 carries for 148 yards and three touchdowns. Receiver Eric Judge hauled in four catches for 92 yards and a touchdown. \nhdown.
