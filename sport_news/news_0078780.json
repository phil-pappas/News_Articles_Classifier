Fans lined up, 40 to 50 deep outside the gates, prior to the ballgame to get into a stadium that had already reached maximum seating capacity. The band, hardly more than 15 strong, sounded two times the size, and the Bullfrog faithful erupted after a big play from the home team. The setting was about what could be expected of a team on the verge of unprecedented success. But on Friday, the atmosphere was just not enough to will Bret Harte to its third consecutive Mother Lode League victory. Amador won 34-7. Due to a first quarter that saw a blown coverage on defense and 40 penalty yards on Bret Harte, the Bullfrogs found themselves down by 13 early for the third straight week. “It’s just by us not executing,” said first-year head coach Casey Kester. “This is the worst execution we have seen since the opening game against Orestimba and also against Calaveras.” Though Bret Harte was able to overcome the deficits and eventually come out victorious in weeks prior, this week was different. Kester said ultimately the negative aura associated with this year's homecoming could’ve contributed to the comeback struggles in the eventual 34-7 defeat Friday. “This week was homecoming week and all the activities that went with that. Plus all the negative activities that went on with school. The kids are dealing with an awful lot of stuff,” said Kester. “The kids still have to come out better, they still have to focus. They just came out today and were sloppy, they couldn’t execute and just couldn’t come back from that.” However, the Bullfrogs were not without their opportunities. Entering the second half, down 13-6, Bret Harte recovered an onside kick inside the Amador 50. But they would punt three plays later. They had another chance the following drive down 19-7, advancing the ball within the red zone, though they eventually lost possession on downs. “The past couple of weeks, they’ve been able to recover and get their heads in the game and play well and not make the mistakes.” said Kester. “This week, they couldn’t ever get their heads back in the game and continued to make mistakes all throughout the game.” On the evening, Amador was able to accumulate over 300 total yards and five touchdowns on offense vs. Bret Harte. Of the total yards gained, two players — quarterback Ben Griffin and running back Daylan Thetford — contributed 283 total yards and four scores. “They were running one of our plays, the quarterback read. Their quarterback is very aggressive at it. He made the read and attacked straight down the field,” said Kester. “Their back is very shifty. They went to a zone blocking scheme, and he was just taking his time and reading the blocks.” Next week, Bret Harte will face winless Riverbank in Angels Camp. “We just have to get in and absolutely drill these guys on discipline this week. Not jumping offsides, not making silly mistakes, keeping their heads in the game,” said Kester. “They didn’t do that tonight and that’s on us coaches.” Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T12:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:23:05.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
