Each digital billboard reading \"Blind to the bat\" with a man dressed as a referee in sunglasses on the board.\nThis comes after the Lions lost in part due to a controversial batting of the ball out of the end zone by Seattle linebacker K.J. Wright after Calvin Johnson fumbled on the half-yard line while trying to score the game-winning touchdown Monday night against the Seahawks.\nSeattle was awarded the ball on a touchback, and NFL officiating czar Dean Blandino later said the Lions should have retained the ball on the 1-yard-line. Detroit lost the game, 13-10 .\nZipp would not say how much the billboards cost, similar to when the group bought the \"$UH?\" and \"$CRUHED!\" billboards in March in the midst of Suh deciding to leave the Lions for Miami and the \"Detroit Lyin'\" billboards in January.\nThe billboards will located mostly on freeways throughout the metro area, including three along Interstate 75, one on M-14, one on Ford Road, one on the Lodge Freeway and one on Coolidge Highway and are expected to go up Tuesday.\n \"\nLions fans purchase billboards protesting non-call during Monday Night Football ", "external_links": ["http://media.video-cdn.espn.com/motion/2015/1006/dm_151006_nfl_megatron_kam_sport_science/dm_151006_nfl_megatron_kam_sport_science_default.jpg", "http://media.video-cdn.espn.com/motion/2015/1006/dm_151006_nba_gutierrez_heat1043/dm_151006_nba_gutierrez_heat1043_default.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/js/merlin-ext.js?v=1.2", "http://a.abcnews.com/assets/beta/js/abcn.js?v=41", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fabcnews.go.com%2FSports%2Flions-fans-purchase-billboards-protesting-call-monday-night%2Fstory%3Fid%3D34291435", "http://media.video-cdn.espn.com/motion/2015/1006/dm_151006_nfl_rovell_scandal_part2/dm_151006_nfl_rovell_scandal_part2_default.jpg", "http://abcnewsplayer-a.akamaihd.net/player/2.24.0.0000/amp.premier/amp.premier.min.js?v=2", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/js/merlin-core.js?v=1.2", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/email/offer?url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/lions-fans-purchase-billboards-protesting-call-monday-night/story?id=34291435&title=Lions+fans+purchase+billboards+protesting+non-call+during+Monday+Night+Football", "http://a.abcnews.com/assets/beta/js/custom/pages/trident_story.js?v=41", "http://a.abcnews.com/assets/js/s_code_15.js?v=4", "http://media.video-cdn.espn.com/motion/2015/1006/dm_151006_nfl_rovell_draft_kings_daily_fantasy_par1025/dm_151006_nfl_rovell_draft_kings_daily_fantasy_par1025_default.jpg", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Lions+fans+purchase+billboards+protesting+non-call+during+Monday+Night+Football+-+ABC+News+-+http%3A%2F%2Fabcn.ws%2F1FSg92Z&via=ABC"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T22:25:22.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
