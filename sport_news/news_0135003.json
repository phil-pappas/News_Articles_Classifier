Back | Next Steve Bisson/ Savannah Morning News - Alex DuBois, 11, prepares to skimboard at Tybee Island. By Nathan Dominitz Blink and you might miss the blond-haired boy toting a skimboard during a beach scene in “The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water” from earlier this year.\nTrain your gaze on Tybee Island’s North Beach Jetty most any day when the waves are breaking right and get a better look at Alex DuBois and his big brother Steven. They are two of the more accomplished young surfers on the local scene and, as happens with siblings, they’re a tad competitive.\n“The entire reason I started skimming was because Steven started skimming,” Alex said. “I wanted to beat him.”\nSteven, who is almost six years older and about a foot taller than Alex, has numerous skimboard honors to his credit. So when little brother wanted to skimboard, he changed his focus to surfing and continued to succeed. While Alex has aspirations for a pro career — following in the footsteps of world champion skimboarder Austin Keen, who honed his skills on Tybee — Steven is more about enjoying the sun, sand and fraternity of the surfing culture.\n“I do it competitively, but I don’t take it as seriously into going pro as other kids are,” Steven said. “I’m just doing it to have fun, really. ... I realize there’s a slim chance of going pro in surfing. I try to have fun with it.”\nSteven, who once dreamed of being a pro skateboarder or surfer, perhaps an architect, now leans toward magazine journalism or, as a self-taught guitarist, something in the arts. But college will come first. He’s undecided.\nAlex doesn’t hesitate to list pro skimboarder as his top choice with photographer as a second career “when I get too old to skimboard — that’ll be like 60.”\nChild’s play\nAlex DuBois is 11 going on 12. He’s fun and funny, smart and at times a smart aleck while still self-deprecating.\nHe can be quite the merry prankster. A few years ago, when he was just learning to skimboard, he would create a scene by falling in front of an unsuspecting beachcomber where the waves break on the shore.\n“He’d make the biggest thud and make noise like he was really hurt,” his mother Michelle DuBois recalled. “He’d lay there until she came running up, ‘Are you OK?’ He’d jump up and go, ‘Boo!’ ... It used to aggravate me.”\nIf Alex gets on his mother’s nerves, Steven allows her to exhale.\nSteven DuBois is 16 going on 30. He’s quiet, self-motivated and as introverted as Alex is extraverted. He’s low maintenance for a parent.\n“Everything about Steven is perfect,” Michelle said. “If a parent chooses a child and wants him to be the best way he can possibly be, that is Steven.\n“I love all my children equally, don’t get me wrong,” continued Michelle, who also has a daughter, Stephanie, 33, “but they’re at both ends of the spectrum.”\nWhile Steven and Alex have very different personalities, they are very much brothers and have more in common than appearances may convey. True, Alex has long, straight blonde hair, while Steven has natural curls which have transformed into sun-bleached dreadlocks since his last haircut about six years ago. They both fit the part as surfers — Steven the laid-back dude and Alex the “grom” or “grommit,” a youngster learning the ropes.\nIt’s a good thing there is no restriction on hairstyle, nor a dress code, where they go to school. Steven, an 11th-grader, and Alex, a sixth-grader, attend the Georgia Cyber Academy, the state’s online public school, from the family’s home on Tybee Island.\nThese honor students’ school uniform is likely to be T-shirts and shorts, as they head about two blocks to the beach as soon as they’re out of classes (often by 12:30 p.m.) and done with homework. They both take advanced classes. Yes, surfing counts toward a physical education credit.\n“Last year (Alex) did an eighth-grade math class, but he was in fifth grade,” said his proud mother, who sought for her children an individualized curriculum matching the student to his level in each subject.\n“I like it much better,” Alex said of the home arrangement rather than attending a brick-and-mortar school. “You don’t have all of the distractions. You can work at your own level.”\nMental game\nAlex will put in the work, especially when the subject interests him. That trait was observed by his former Tybee Island YMCA youth basketball coach, Brad Butterworth, a former high school and college coach who also has a background in surfing.\n“He’s on a different plane than most of the kids,” Butterworth said. “I knew from Day One he is a high-level kid.”\nAlex wasn’t very good at basketball at the start, Butterworth recalled of that 10-and-under team, but he had the mindset, the work ethic and the team-first commitment as well as great athleticism for his age to excel.\n“I’m always looking at kids from that lens, what kind of kid is that mentally. From Day One, his mental approach was on a different level,” said Butterworth, 37, who now runs a basketball development technology firm in the Pacific Northwest. “The mental separation, that’s what Alex has. This incredible mental focus relates to whatever he does, skimming, basketball or mathematics.”\nAlex got into skimboarding because of his brother and latched on to additional role models to improve and compete in the sport.\n“Fortunately, we have people like (veteran local surfers) Randall Kato, Leland Lively and Josh (Richardson) and other people who knew Alex was young and was serious about learning,” his mother Michelle said. “He would shut up and listen to them. He wasn’t as rambunctious as he is now. He would focus on what they were teaching him. He has a lot of respect when he goes out in the lineup with the big guys. He has for the last couple of years. He’s fine. He’s a different person when he’s on the water.”\nAlex added: “Out on the water I’m serious. ... Definitely, when it comes to contests, I’m serious.”\nAlex has piled up titles in Eastern Surfing Association contests in the Georgia District as well as along the Atlantic coast, including the Menehune Division at age 9 at the Florida Skimboarding Pro/Am in 2013, and again at age 11 in August at Vilano Beach, Fla.\nWith the accolades have come sponsorships from national companies — makers of boards, clothing, equipment, a website — as well as a local company, Southern Urgent Care, which could come in handy.\nSteven, who also has sponsors, still has a few tricks up his sleeve — actually, on the skimboard — to stay ahead of his little brother, and give him a push.\n“Every trick he learns, I make myself learn it,” Alex said.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14697702.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14697706.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14697704.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14697704.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14697706.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14697702.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14697707.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14697703.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14697705.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14697705.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14697703.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14697707.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-13T20:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:07:11.612+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
