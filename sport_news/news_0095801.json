Mariota was tended to on the field by medical personnel, but remained in the game and went on to turn the ball over four times. Vernon was flagged for roughing the passer on the play and was called for a second personal foul later in the game. For Marcus Mariota, the hits keep on coming \nAt the postgame press conference, Titans coach Ken Whisenhunt was asked for an update on Mariota’s condition. \n“Surely there is going to be some soreness there,” Whisenhunt said about Mariota’s knee, “so we’ll see how he is physically as we go forward.” \nWhisenhunt took exception to the hit. \n“I think it was done with the idea of trying to hurt our quarterback,” Whisenhunt said, “and that’s (BS) football.” Whisenhunt reacts to hit on Marcus Mariota during game against the Dolphins. George Walker IV / The Tennessean \nThe Dolphins (2-3) sacked Mariota five times in the first half after having just one sack through their first four games this season. \nThe Titans (1-4) have lost four games in a row and eight consecutive at home. Titans, Mariota roughed up by Dolphins \nMariota completed 21 of 33 pass attempts for 219 yards, a touchdown, two interceptions and two fumbles. He had a 67.6 passer rating when he was removed late in the fourth quarter. \nAfter the game, Mariota said he expects to be able to practice this week and play against the Falcons. He also said Vernon was contrite. \n“He came up to me after the game and apologized,” Mariota said, “so I don’t think it was malicious at all.” \nReach Jason Wolf at jwolf@tennessean.com and follow him on Twitter at @JasonWolf and on Instagram at TitansBeat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:58:14.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
