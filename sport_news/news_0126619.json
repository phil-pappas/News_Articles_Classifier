Here are some of the wackiest things that happened in the world of sports yesterday. Mascot loses head (literally) on trampoline flip dunk \nOh no. The Indiana Pacers mascot, Boomer, had a couple of mini-Boomers out there doing cool trampoline dunks. But when one attempted a flip dunk, well, he lost his mascot head. A video posted by Bryan Leach Jr. (@bryanleach) on Oct 13, 2015 at 5:55pm PDT \nMy favorite part of this is the reaction of the big mascot, Boomer, who puts his hands to his head, shocked, and goes evaluates the mascot carnage. That's good mascoting. English soccer team loses 14-0, live tweets game \nEnglish soccer is fun because teams from very different levels of play have the opportunity to actually face off in competitive action: it's like if the Utah Jazz got to play your local rec league team from time to time. \nDidcot Town FC, a semi-pro team, took on MK Dons yesterday in the \"Berks and Bucks County Senior Cup\", which is a real thing. MK Dons, though, are in the league just below the famed English Premier League: in other words, they've spent millions of dollars on players. \nThe game didn't go well for Didcot Town FC, but their Twitter account kept a sense of humor about proceedings: 84min - 0-14 and there's 6 minutes to go. — Didcot Town FC (@didcottownfc) October 13, 2015 Just a reminder if tonight's game ends in a draw, extra time and penalties will follow. — Didcot Town FC (@didcottownfc) October 13, 2015 \nYou can find the whole narrative on their Twitter feed . Bounce pass alley-oop! \nThe NBA preseason is in full swing, meaning that NBA highlights will become a regular feature of From Left Field. This is a neat play from the Orlando Magic, with Mario Hezonja giving a bounce pass alley-oop feed for the dunk. \nWhile Orlando isn't Lob City, maybe we can find a new way to recognize them for their in-game creativity.
