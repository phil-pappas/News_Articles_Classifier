But sadly, this year’s festival will be the last, according to Savannah Folk Music Society president Chris Desa.\n“We’ll keep going on with our monthly concerts and we hope to keep the Old-Time Country Dances going, too,” Desa says. “But we can’t keep doing the festival forever without financial support.\n“The amount we get from the city barely covers half of the expenses. The festival is too expensive and takes too much of my time.\n“I actually forfeited three days of billing because I gave up work so we would have the festival,” he says. “I can’t take those kinds of hits.”\nThe 2015 festival will follow the same format as in the past.\n“We’ll have the Folkfest Friday in Ellis Square with all local guys,” Desa says. “We’ve got a pretty good lineup. It’s a good chance to showcase local people. We’ll have the songwriting contest, sponsored by Portman’s Music. Four kids applied and will compete on Saturday.\n“We’ll have a songwriting workshop with Rupert Wates, a British guy who relocated to the United States,” Desa says. “We’ve had him many times for First Friday and he will open the concert on Sunday.”\nOn Saturday night, the Old-Time Country Dance will be at Savannah Arts Academy, a new venue.\n“Sunday is the big day, with the concert at Grayson Stadium,” Desa says. “We’ll start at 1:30 p.m. and have a good lineup.”\nThe Noteworthy Art and More Auction is a highlight of the festival. Instruments donated by the Gretsch Foundation have been painted, carved and sculpted by local artists, including playable instruments and art instruments.\nAll will be sold through a silent auction during the Friday and Sunday events. One new playable Gretsch guitar, signed by all the performers at the Sunday concert, will also be auctioned.\nThe guitars and violins can be seen in Ellis Square on Friday and will be auctioned Sunday in Grayson Stadium.\nThe final concert has always been at the Grayson Stadium.\n“The Sand Gnats have quit, so we won’t have concessions,” Desa says. “This year, we’re allowing coolers and letting people bring their own snacks.”\nWates is coming to perform with his bass player, Desa says. They will open the final concert.\n“We’ve got Arvel Bird, who is Scottish-Native American and plays a killer violin and sings, as well,” Desa says. “His wife, Kimberly, is one of the best hammer dulcimer players.\n“Ken and Brad Kolodner are next, and will be very well-received. The winner of the songwriting competition will play next.\n“Then we’ll have the band Runaway Home,” Desa says. “They’re an Americana kind of mix, with two singer/songwriters, a guitarist and fiddle player.”\nClosing out the show will be the Thompsons, who play acoustic rock, pop, country, Celtic, jazz and funk with aplomb.\n“Myles is the best young fiddle player I’ve seen,” Desa says. “Tim was a national champion in 2008.”\nThe two have played the Montreal Jazz Festival, Walnut Valley Festival and the Chet Atkins Festival, and opened for Spyro Gyro, Don Williams, Mountain Heart and Richard Elliot.\nIn 2008, Tim was named the International Finger-style Champion. His son began playing violin when he was just 5 and by the time he was 12, was studying music theory and improvising beyond his years.\nBoth are songwriters, and Myles has added mandolin to his repertoire.\nTim has appeared with Tommy Emmanuel, Crystal Gayle and Hwy 101. He has recorded 11 CDs and two DVDs, the most recent being “21st Century Man.”\n“I grew up in a musical family,” Tim says. “I grew up with seven kids.\n“I played the piano first, then started with trombone. I was about 12 when I discovered the guitar.\n“I pretty much knew right away I wanted to be a musician,” he says. “The thing about guitar is that if you put it in the hands of 10 different people, you have 10 different instruments. It’s easy to express who you are, your personality and that kind of thing.”\nWhen he was 5, Myles saw an ensemble playing violins and wanted to learn to play. He enjoys being in the duo.\n“We just started playing together,” Myles says. “I started writing and we wanted to get the duo off the ground.\n“That’s kind of been my goal. My dad plays guitar so I wanted to play something different.\n“We call it Americana fusion,” he says. “We’ll do some folk tunes, mostly originals that me and my dad wrote, and a little bit of Latin and jazz stuff, as well.”\n“The way we approach it is as one unique sound,” Tim says. “We want to do tunes that connect with an audience. We build our musicianship into the tunes that we sing and we have instrumental things, as well.”\nSongwriting comes naturally to both Thompsons.\n“Because we’re playing all the time, we’re always thinking about trying to come up with something new along with all the voices,” Tim says. “We’re always hearing little grooves and melodies and we get lyric ideas.\n“Sometimes it’s a song title and sometimes it’s just a concept where you write a lyric and see where it leaves,” he says. “As far as instrumental things, I call them little ditties.”\nEvery year, the two travel far to perform.\n“We put about 55,000 miles on the car every year and that doesn’t include the flying we do,” Tim says. “A few weeks ago, we covered 9,000 miles in a week. I get tired, but I like traveling.”\nWhile Tim has been to Savannah, he hasn’t performed here, although he has performed in Georgia.\n“We’re really looking forward to playing Savannah,” Tim says. “We consider our music high-energy with an occasional slow one to let people gather their thoughts.”\n2015 SAVANNAH FOLK MUSIC FESTIVAL SCHEDULE\nOCT. 9\nFolkfest will showcase local talent in Ellis Square (Rain site: First Presbyterian Church, 520 Washington Ave.)\n7-7:40 p.m. Chris Desa\n7:45-8:15 p.m. Clark Byron\n8:20-8:50 p.m. Lauren Lapointe\n8:55-9:30 p.m. Jason Bible\n9:35-10:05 p.m. Jean Paul and Dominique Carton\n10:10-10:45 p.m. Savannah Ceili Band\n10:50-11 p.m. Ensemble sing-along\nOCT. 10\n2-3 p.m. Youth Songwriting Competition in Stewart Hall, First Presbyterian Church, 520 Washington Ave.\n3:30-5:30 p.m. Youth Songwriting Workshop with Rupert Yates, also in Stewart Hall.\n7:30-11 p.m. Saturday Old-Time Country Dance with Paving Gravy, Savannah Arts Academy Gym, 500 Washington Ave.\nOCT. 11\nSunday Concert at Grayson Stadium, 1401 E.
