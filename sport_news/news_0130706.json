(Photo: Provided)\n3 CONNECT 46 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Xavier and Mount St. Joseph announced in August the creation of a Lauren Hill Tipoff Classic to honor the late Lions player, who died in April at 19 after battling an inoperable brain tumor.\nNow the schools have revealed plans to give away 5,000 bobbleheads of Hill at the Nov. 14 women's basketball doubleheader at Cintas Center.\nXavier hosts Evansville at 1 p.m. and Mount St. Joseph faces Hiram College about 30 minutes after the first outing. Both games will be televised on FOX Sports Ohio.\n“Lauren would have loved the bobblehead of herself,” said Lisa Hill, Lauren's mother. “It’s a fun way to celebrate Lauren’s first collegiate basket. This was the 'Best Moment' of 2014 for my family seeing her achieve her sports dream. I hope this little memento reminds people to NEVER GIVE UP!\"\nHill raised nearly $1.8 million for The Cure Starts Now Foundation after she was diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma. When her quest to play in her first collegiate basketball game earned an NCAA exemption, the Lions' opener was moved up to Nov. 2, 2014.\nHill scored the first and last baskets of Mount St. Joseph's 66-55 victory over Hiram College before a sold-out crowd of 10,250 and a national television audience.\nShe scored five baskets in her college basketball career, but her story and fundraising efforts affected a nation. Professional athletes like Cleveland Cavaliers superstar LeBron James and then-Bengals player Devon Still reached out in support.\nProceeds from November's Lauren Hill Tipoff Classic games will benefit The Cure Starts Now Foundation.\nTickets are $10 for adults and $5 for youth (ages 3-17) and are valid for both games. They're are available online at GoXavier.com or Ticketmaster.com , over the phone at (800) 745-3000, or in person at the Xavier Athletics Ticket Office. Groups of 15 or more can purchase tickets for $5 each by calling (513) 745-3411 ext. 7.\nAs part of the event, The Cure Starts Now Foundation, WLWT Channel 5, WXIX Channel 19 and WKRC Channel 12 will present the “2.2M for 22 in 22” Telethon. Seeking to further Lauren Hill’s efforts and achieve her ultimate goal of $2.2 million in new cancer research funding, the telethon will run through the night for 22 hours prior to Tipoff Classic's start.\nDonations can be made through www.layup4lauren.com or by calling (513) 772-4888.\n3 CONNECT 46 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.thecurestartsnow.org/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/13/Cincinnati/Cincinnati/635803262812662848-LaurenHillbobblehead.jpg", "http://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/college/xavier/2015/08/26/xu-msj--hold-lauren-hill-tipoff-classic/32394449/", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//cin.ci/1Lsfo0K&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c711c85d58e411988f13438d0dec93db9715f141/r=400x400/local/-/media/2015/10/13/Cincinnati/Cincinnati/635803262812662848-LaurenHillbobblehead.jpg", "http://www.ticketmaster.com/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f9b182328b13fd53a88f87bb59f6593ae00ec97d/c=0-22-178-156&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/13/Cincinnati/Cincinnati/635803262812662848-LaurenHillbobblehead.jpg", "http://www.goxavier.com/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//cin.ci/1Lsfo0K&text=Tipoff%20Classic%20features%20Lauren%20Hill%20bobblehead&via=usatoday"], "published": "2015-10-13T18:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:52:08.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
