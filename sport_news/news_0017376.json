The 2016 Barracuda Championship is set for June 30-July 3 at Montreux Golf & Country Club, opposite the World Golf Championship-Bridgestone Invitational at Firestone Country Club in Akron, Ohio. The new schedule released on Wednesday reflects a temporary shuffling of a number of tournaments to accommodate the Olympic Men’s Golf Competition at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Aug. 11-14. The tourney on the edge of the Sierra previously known as the Reno-Tahoe Open has typically been held in late July or early August. Next summer it will be sandwiched between the Quicken Loans National at Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, Maryland and the Greenbrier Classic in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:38:58.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
