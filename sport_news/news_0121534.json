The Mets’ executives were so excited back in May they could not hide their smiles. After five years of talking about the young power arms that would rebuild this organization, they were going to see it in real life on the field.\nAt Wrigley Field, the Mets had lined up Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard and Matt Harvey to start back-to-back-to-back for the first time.\nThere was talk about the series being the beginning of a new Mets’ era: the Young Aces Era.\nLIVE BLOG: FOLLOW THE NLCS BETWEEN THE METS AND CUBS\nAnd it began with a giant flop. The Mets were swept at Wrigley, with deGrom, Syndergaard and Harvey going down largely thanks to the impotent offense.\nNow, the Mets are preparing to face the Cubs again, and they’re even more excited.\nBoth teams, rich with young talent, are a little older and more experienced, and will face off in the best-of-7 National League Championship Series that begins Saturday night at Citi Field with Harvey facing off against veteran Jon Lester.\n“The Cubs won 97 (games), we won 90. The difference in the two records was the 0-7 we had against the Cubs,” Sandy Alderson said. “This is a different team. The young pitching we have has a little more experience. The offense is better.\nAndrew Theodorakis/New York Daily News Matt Harvey. “They are a good team, they have some outstanding young talent. It’s going to be a great series. We’re happy they are on their way to New York.”\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE\nThe Cubs bring a wealth of young, talented position players to Flushing this weekend for the first two games. Anthony Rizzo, 26, is the veteran of the young Cubbies offense and he has played like it, hitting .278 with 31 homers and 101 RBI.\nHe helped guide youngsters including All-Star Kris Bryant, who hit .275 with 26 homers and 99 RBI after his April call-up. Two young potential game-changers for the Cubs are shortstop Javier Baez, who replaced the injured Addison Russell (hamstring) on the playoff roster, and catcher Kyle Schwarber.\nBaez hit .289 with a home run in 28 games in the regular season with 24 strikeouts in 76 at-bats, but talent evaluators have always felt his power potential could be huge. Schwarber has hit three playoff home runs, including a monster that went over the scoreboard at Wrigley.\nWhile the Cubs outscored the Mets, 27-11, in those seven regular-season games, the Met rotation has grown up since the first half of the season. Syndergaard has developed from a hard-throwing kid feeling his way through his first months in the majors, to a smart pitcher who battled Zack Greinke admirably in Game 2 of the NLDS and then smoked the Dodgers mixing his 100-mph fastball with a devastating 83-mph curveball in an inning of relief in Game 5.\nAnd deGrom, who struggled early in the season, has built on his 2014 NL Rookie of the Year season. He outdueled both Dodger Cy Young candidates, Clayton Kershaw and Greinke, striking out 20 and issuing just four walks as he went 2-0 with a 1.38 ERA in the NLDS.\nAndrew Theodorakis/New York Daily News Noah Syndergaard. Harvey has come through some midseason struggles and is ready to toss aside those restrictive innings limits, and the Mets have added talented lefthanded rookie Steven Matz to the rotation.\nBut it’s not just the growth of those young arms.\n“We’re a different team than we were,” said Michael Cuddyer.”Obviously our offense is a little different, our confidence is a lot different than when we faced them.”\nThe Mets had a very different lineup when they last faced the Cubs, losing to their Cy Young candidate Jake Arrietta, 6-1, at Citi Field. Darrell Ceciliani was playing center field, Eric Campbell was in left field and Johnny Monell was behind the plate.\nSince that July 2 game, the Mets have added Yoenis Cespedes, Kelly Johnson, Tyler Clippard and Addison Reed via trades. They also have David Wright, who was rehabbing his spinal stenosis, and Travis d’Arnaud, then healing a broken hand, back in the lineup. And they promoted their own precocious young bat, 2014 first-round draft pick Michael Conforto, who homered in his very first playoff at-bat.\nTerry Collins said this NLCS will be a completely different matchup from both sides.\n“They are probably better, they are red-hot,” the Mets manager said. “They’re swinging the bats great, those young players are playing great. We’ve got to get ready to get our pitching set up. Using Noah (in relief Thursday night) I don’t know when we can use him again. (Jacob), well I don’t know when he can pitch again,” Collins said. “But it should be fun. We have David back, Cespedes is here. The dynamics are going to be a little different this time.”\nAnd maybe, unlike that series in Wrigley back in May, it will finally be the real beginning of that new era for the Mets.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:54:04.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
