Poteau 50 Broken Bow 8 SUMMARY &#8212; The Pirates kept their perfect season going, scoring on their first two possessions as they built a 29-0 lead before halftime. TURNING POINT &#8212; The Pirates took the opening kickoff and marched 80 yards in eight plays to get on the board as quarterback Ben Klutts tossed a 27-yard TD pass to Dalton Smith. STAT &#8212; Poteau tailback Roger Barcheers accounted for 200 of the team's 314 yards of total offense in the opening half. By Buck RinggoldTIMES RECORD • BRINGGOLD@SWTIMES.COM \nPOTEAU — Unlike last week, the Poteau Pirates rarely had lightning-fast touchdown drives, at least in the first half. \nInstead, in Thursday’s 4A-4 game with Broken Bow, the Pirates moved the ball rather methodically. The offense still was able to put points on the board, as the Pirates scored 29 points in the opening half as they went on to a 50-8 win. \n“You hope for the big plays, and it can happen with any play, but when the big play isn’t there, within our scheme, we always have that check-down or the intermediate plays, and we did a good job of taking those and Roger (Barcheers) did a good job running, and the offensive line did a good job for the most part, and any time you can win 50-8, it’s a good night. And the kids played well, but there’s still a lot of stuff we have to clean up.” \nPoteau (7-0, 4-0) also kept its perfect season going. With Sallisaw beating Stilwell Thursday, it sets up a showdown for the 4A-4 lead Oct. 23, as the Pirates travel to face the Black Diamonds. \n“(Starting 7-0) feels great,” senior receiver/defensive back Austin Skelton said. “I think we expected it to be like this, but we just have to execute, and I think we have so far, and I think we’ll continue to.” \nIn last week’s win against Stilwell, Poteau scored on the very first play and went on to score 41 first-quarter points and had 61 points by halftime. Although the Pirates didn’t score on the first play Thursday, they still scored on the opening series. \nPoteau put together an eight-play 80-yard drive at the outset, culminating in a 27-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Ben Klutts to Dalton Smith. The Pirates then went for two and got it, as Klutts hooked up with Austin Skelton, giving Poteau an 8-0 lead less than two minutes into the game. \nBroken Bow (4-3, 2-2) was held to a three-and-out on its first series, punting the ball back to the Pirates. Again, the Pirates reeled off a sustained TD drive, going 67 yards in seven plays, though it ended with a big play, as tailback Roger Barcheers broke loose for a 44-yard dash into the end zone. Poteau went for two again and converted, with Mason Grimm hauling in Klutts’ pass for a 16-0 lead midway through the opening quarter. \nPoteau couldn’t make it 3-for-3 on possessions ending in touchdowns, as the Pirates were stopped short on fourth down on their third series. Broken Bow took over and, as action shifted into the second quarter, moved inside the Poteau 15, but was denied on a fourth-down run. \nThe Pirates finally got their first short TD drive near the midway point of the second, completing it in just two plays. Barcheers caught a 29-yard pass for the six points, and Jesse Barnes tacked on the PAT for a 22-0 lead. \nThen the next time the Pirates got the ball, they held it for 10 plays, covering 85 yards. Barcheers capped it with his second TD run of the night, from 3 yards out, and Barnes’ PAT upped it to 29-0 with 1:32 left until halftime. \nPoteau kept the shutout for the first half. The Savages marched down to the Pirate 8, but on the final play before intermission, a pass toward the end zone was knocked away by Skelton. Also, the Pirates stopped Broken Bow on the opening second-half series, as Elijah Price intercepted a pass at his own 1-yard line. \nThe Pirates were unable to move the ball, forcing a punt. A high snap eventually resulted in a 10-yard kick to the Poteau 16, where Broken Bow finally broke the shutout five plays later with a touchdown and a two-point conversion. \nBut one play later, Poteau answered. On first-and-10 from the Pirate 20, Klutts threw a short sideline route to Skelton, who took off for an 80-yard TD as the Pirates made it 36-8. Klutts hooked up with Skelton again right before the end of the third quarter, as Skelton caught the ball in the end zone from 12 yards out. \n“I just liked the fact when (Broken Bow) did score, we had a couple of things happen bad but when they did score, we kind of came back and answered with two straight scoring possessions that kind of put the game out of commission,” Mazey said. \nPoteau got the final margin on its next possession, as backup quarterback Jett Pitchford found a wide-open Brynn Hammon for a 32-yard TD with 9:31 left in the game. Barnes added the PAT for the 50th point. \nA week after generating 588 yards, the Pirates accumulated 555 yards of total offense, rushing for 211 and passing for 344. Barcheers rushed for 134 yards on 19 carries and also caught six passes for 95 yards. Klutts was 17-of-21 passing for 292 yards, while Skelton hauled in five of those passes from Klutts for 122 yards. \n“We just came out and executed,” Skelton said. “I think we’re just so much more balanced than last year; it actually frees up Roger to get more yards this year, and the receivers and quarterback getting yards, I just think it’s a very effective offense we’re running.” \nThe Pirate defense held Broken Bow to 150 yards rushing, and the Savages completed only one pass, which went for 22 yards. In the first half, Poteau held the Savages to 63 yards total. High School Football Poteau 50, Broken Bow 8 Broken Bow 0 0 8 0 — 8 Poteau 16 13 14 7 — 50 First Quarter Pot — D.
