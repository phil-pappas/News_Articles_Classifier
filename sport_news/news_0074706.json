Joe Rexrode, Detroit Free Press 3:34 p.m. EDT September 30, 2015 Buy Photo MSU wide receiver Monty Madaris (Photo: Kevin W. Fowler/For the Lansing State Journal) Buy Photo \nEAST LANSING – Get used to hearing about Monty Madaris. \nThe Michigan State receiver is going to get a chance to make an impact this season, after a thigh injury kept him out of the first four games. And then he’s going to be one of the big names entering next season, when fellow junior R.J. Shelton and freshman Felton Davis join him as the only receivers with any substantial experience. \n“He catches the ball outstanding,” MSU receivers coach Terry Samuel said today of Madaris, after deeming him “100%” healthy. “He runs great routes, he runs hard routes. He’s very similar to Keith (Mumphery). He will go get it wherever it is presented. If it means he blocks somebody, he’ll block somebody hard. If it means run a nice route, a crisp route, he does that, as well. He’s really got the package; it’s just a matter of he needs to come out there and play, and I just hope we don’t have any more setbacks with injuries.” MSU's Jack Conklin does not have season-ending injury \nAnd No. 2 MSU (4-0) needs to possess the ball more, Samuel said, so Madaris and Davis can get looks. MSU coach Mark Dantonio said this week he has asked, at times, for Davis to get more snaps . But the Spartans, entering Saturday’s homecoming game against Purdue (noon, ESPN2), have been in four competitive games. \n“If I get puckered up, I mean, yeah, it gets harder to put him out there,” Samuel said. “But that’s like anything. You want to make sure you get the best guys out there for Connor (Cook) and the team and make the right decisions. But you’ve got to let those guys play.” \nBecause after Aaron Burbridge, Macgarrett Kings Jr., AJ Troup and DeAnthony Arnett depart, there will be plenty of need for pass catchers. MSU is bringing in a heralded class of receivers , but Madaris, in particular, has time in the system and physical maturity to offer. \n“You have to start developing that trust,” Samuel said of Madaris. “And he’s got to go out there and start experiencing this offense and making adjustments and decisions within the routes, so he can have that experience and be ready for next year. Because we do need him to be playing every game next year.” \nContact Joe Rexrode: jrexrode@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @joerexrode .
