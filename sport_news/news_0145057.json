Against the Redskins, he blocked a punt for a safety. His heroics proved even more thrilling against the Bills as he took a swing pass from Eli Manning on third-and-short, broke three tackles and brought a 51-yard touchdown to the house, sealing the victory in the fourth quarter.\nEye-catching \nLB Devon Kennard registered the first interception of his career, tracking Bills TE Charles Clay up the sideline and making a diving catch. … The Giants smothered Bills RB Karlos Williams, holding him to 40 yards on 18 carries (a 2.2 yards-per-carry average). … DE Kerry Wynn was outstanding against the run, setting the edge while also recording seven solo tackles. … Rookie DE Owa Odighizuwa made his NFL debut and picked up his first tackle, reading the option perfectly and decking Bills QB Tyrod Taylor behind the line of scrimmage for a loss. … Wyckoff native Chris Hogan made five catches for 43 yards in the losing effort for the Bills.\nCostly mistakes \nA comedy of errors ensued on the Giants’ point-after try following their first touchdown. After a penalty negated a rolling snap from LS Zak DeOssie, Josh Brown drilled the right upright from 38 yards out, missing the attempt. … Rookie TE Will Tye dropped a third-down pass – the first target of his career. … The Bills committed 17 penalties, including two that took a pair of touchdowns off the board. … Manning’s streak of passes without an interception ended at 142 late in the fourth quarter.\nInjury update \nKennard tweaked his right hamstring while chasing Taylor out of bounds late in the fourth quarter. He did not return and will undergo tests today to determine the severity. Kennard said he doesn’t believe \"it’s too bad.\" … WR/KR Dwayne Harris hurt his ribs, but returned to the game. … LT Ereck Flowers’ ankle was rolled up on during the game’s first play and he missed two additional series, but returned and played the rest of the game.\nLooking ahead \nThe Giants (2-2) will head home and must avoid a letdown when they welcome the struggling 49ers (1-3) to East Rutherford for a prime-time Sunday affair at MetLife Stadium.\n— Art Stapleton", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:43:40.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
