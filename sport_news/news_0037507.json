At halftime, Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson pulled Beuerlein aside.\n\"You're playing great,\" Johnson said. \"Listen, all we have to do is make a few plays in the second half and we're all set. You're protecting the ball, you're throwing it away, you're not giving them any short fields.\"\nThe Eagles had one of the great defenses of that era with Reggie White, Jerome Brown, Clyde Simmons, Seth Joyner, Eric Allen, Andre Waters and Wes Hopkins. But the offensive game plan was working out exactly as planned by Johnson: Offer the Eagles no gifts. Beuerlein threw a touchdown pass to Michael Irvin in the second half, and the Cowboys prevailed 25-13.\nThe Cowboys survived despite a 9-of-31 passing performance by Beuerlein for 145 yards. They survived because Beuerlein didn't turn the ball over. No interceptions, no fumbles and only one sack against a team that led the NFL in defense, sacks and takeaways that season.\nAnd that's what any NFL team wants from its backup quarterback: mistake-free football. That's how you survive when your Pro Bowl starter can't go. And that's the challenge facing Brandon Weeden on Sunday as he embarks on what looms as an eight-week engagement filling in for Tony Romo.\nThe Cowboys were a 6-5 team in 1991 when Beuerlein stepped in for Aikman in the second half of a game against Washington. He threw a fourth-quarter TD pass that day in a 24-21 triumph over the Redskins -- the first of five consecutive victories engineered by Beuerlein to give Jerry Jones and Jimmy Johnson their first playoff berth on the road to a dynasty.\nBeuerlein threw 111 consecutive passes without an interception covering his first four games filling in for Aikman. Mistake-free football allowed Beuerlein to survive in a role that produces far more failures than success stories.\nAikman was the first option for the Cowboys at quarterback. He's the guy the Cowboys wanted on the field. Beuerlein was the second option -- the quarterback the Cowboys didn't want on the field.\nSince 2000, when NFL teams league-wide have been able to line up their first option at quarterback -- the Tom Bradys, Peyton Mannings and Ben Roethlisbergers -- they have won 52.5 percent of their games. But when teams have been forced to go to their second option -- the Bruce Gradkowskis, Mike Glennons and Jimmy Clausens -- they have managed to win only 44 percent of the time.\nThere have been some notable exceptions.\nBrady went 11-3 in 2001 when he stepped in for an injured Drew Bledsoe, delivering the Patriots their first NFL championship that season. Roethlisberger went 13-0 as a rookie filling in for injured Tommy Maddox at Pittsburgh in 2004, quarterbacking the Steelers to the AFC title game.\nBut for every Brady and Roethlisberger, there are five Gradkowskis, Glennons, Clausens, Case Keenums and John Skeltons. There's a reason clubs are willing to award their first option at quarterback $100 million contracts -- but give their second option only a fraction of that in salary. You ask your first option to win games. You ask your second option not to lose them.\n\"The goal was to get out of that game without turning the ball over and, when we had a chance to make plays, we had to make them,\" recalled Beuerlein, who now works as an NFL analyst for CBS. \"The quickest way out if you're a backup quarterback is to turn the ball over. They're not going to be overly patient if you can't protect the football.\"\nLast season, only 16 teams kept their starting quarterback on the field for all 16 games. Those 16-game starters produced nine of the 12 playoff berths and won 58 percent of their games. The other 16 teams combined to win only 37.5 percent of the time they had their backup quarterbacks on the field, including a loss by Weeden in his lone start for the Cowboys.\nWeeden threw twice as many interceptions (two) as touchdowns that day in a 28-17 home loss to the Cardinals. Since winning their last Super Bowl in the 1995 season, the Cowboys are 18-29 with backup quarterbacks on the field.\nWhat the Cowboys need are more Beuerleins, more wins and fewer turnovers -- starting Sunday when Weeden hits the field to keep in an attempt to keep a playoff contender afloat against the Atlanta Falcons.\nListen to Rick Gosselin at 10:50 a.m. Tuesdays on Sportsradio 1310 AM/96.7 FM The Ticket with Norm Hitzges.\nMORE MUST-CLICK COWBOYS CONTENT OPINION, ANALYSIS\nCowlishaw: Cowboys' task lies somewhere between the unthinkable and the improbable\nTroy Aikman on tough lesson for Tony Romo: When you're hurt, teammates 'don't really care'\nLaufenberg: Why I loved the Cowboys' decision to deal for Matt Cassel\nMoore: Brandon Weeden can't play like he did last year for Cowboys to tread water until Tony Romo returns\nMoore: Cowboys pin hopes on 'Default Triplets'; can they hold fort until Romo, Dez return?\nLaufenberg: What the Cowboys MUST do to beat the Atlanta Falcons\nBRANDON WEEDEN: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW 10 things to know about Cowboys QB Brandon Weeden, including the first impression he made on Dez Bryant\nGosselin: Cowboys' survival guide with Brandon Weeden at QB\nBabe Laufenberg on why Brandon Weeden is ready\nSturm: A couple of ways I think Weeden can improve his play\nMoore: Brandon Weeden can't play like he did last year for Cowboys to tread water until Tony Romo returns\nWHAT PLAYERS, COACHES SAY\nByron Jones on why a birthday celebration with his Cowboys teammates could be painful\nCowboys Q&A: Danny McCray on who wins a team-wide Hunger Games, how realistic 'Ballers' is\nCowboys' Joseph Randle: 'I feel like every run is going to break and be a touchdown'\nJerry Jones: Our starter is Brandon Weeden, and 'you won't see a more gifted passer'\nOwner Jerry Jones: Cowboys need more from running game, and Weeden can help\nINJURIES Jason Witten: I expect to play at a high level Sunday; 'I feel good'\nStephen Jones: Very fair goal to think Dez Bryant will be back after Week 6 bye\nCowboys DE Jeremy Mincey ruled out for Sunday's game against Falcons\n'Very likely' Randy Gregory returns after Cowboys' Week 6 bye\nABOUT THE FALCONS 10 things Cowboys fans need to know about the Atlanta Falcons, including Julio Jones' ridiculous catch\nWeek 3 NFL picks: Who's on Dallas?
