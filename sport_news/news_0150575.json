A proposal in this regard was presented to the state government by NABARD and Bharatiya Mahila Bank (BMB) after evaluating the initiative. The state government has agreed to provide counter guarantee for the scheme. Chief Minister Harish Rawat announced this initiative at the Seraphina Seva Kendra Sammelan at St Mary’s School, Clement Town, on the occasion of the completion of 100 Self Help Groups for women by the seva kendra. Rawat said out of the 15-16 sarais being constructed on the Char Dham Yatra route, some would be reserved for women or women Self Help Groups to conduct business activities. The government was planning to connect the groups with the hospitality sector. “As women prepare healthy and delicious food at their home, their cooking skills may be used in the hospitality sector too. The tailoring skills of women may be used to prepare dresses for police and jail departments,” he said. The state government was concerned about the debts of the Self Help Groups and would consider providing them a one-time grant to take themselves out of the debt trap, he said. Rawat thanked Seraphina Seva Kendra for increasing the numbers of SHGs from 13 to 100 within a year. “The government cannot do everything alone, we need collective efforts to fight the backwardness, poverty, illiteracy, social evils, gender disparity, crime against women and alcoholism,” he said. The government would focus on providing basic infrastructure to sell the products made by SHGs and providing them opportunities remains a major concern of the government. A part of some places, such as bus stands, would be reserved for selling the products made by the SHGs, he stated. Rawat said Indira Amma Bhojnalaya Yojana was a symbolic effort and there was a need to convert them into collective efforts on large scale. The CM appreciated the efforts of St Mary’s School in education sector.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:36:58.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
