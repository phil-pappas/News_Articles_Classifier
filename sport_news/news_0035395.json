Join the Conversation Matthew Stevens , Montgomery Advertiser 8:17 p.m. CDT October 11, 2015 Auburn offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee talks about current QB battle. Matthew Stevens \nAUBURN – Sean White and Jeremy Johnson have both taken first-team reps in practice over the last week, according to Auburn offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee . \nLashlee gave no details to the name of the Tigers starting quarterback Thursday night when they travel to Kentucky (4-1, 2-1 in Southeastern Conference) in Commonwealth Stadium. When asked directly about who would likely get the first snap against the Wildcats, Lashlee answered with “I don’t know yet” suggesting that was the decision of Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn . \nMalzahn will speak Monday morning to the media and has announced the starting quarterback each of the last two weeks when White took over the job for Johnson and was given a second straight start vs. San Jose State. \nLashlee did suggest Sunday night that once a starter is determined, this Auburn staff has always preferred to have that player take every snap in the game barring an injury. However, with the decision not being entirely his call, Lashlee wouldn’t rule out a multiple quarterback system for the beginning of the game against Kentucky (6 p.m., ESPN). \n“I think always the plan is to stick with the guy you start a game because hopefully that means you are doing well, both guys have been preparing to play,” Lashlee said. \nMalzahn said on Sept. 23 that the decision to bench Johnson was at least partially due to his lack of confidence in the Montgomery native after his disappointing start to the 2015 season. \n“I think it was a little bit of a lot of things,\" Malzahn said. \"I would say confidence is one thing, there's no doubt, but I think it's a little bit of everything.” \nAuburn Tigers quarterback Jeremy Johnson (6) talks to Auburn Tigers quarterback Sean White (13) after the NCAA football game between LSU Tigers and Auburn on Saturday, Sept. 19, 2015, at Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, La. LSU Tigers defeated Auburn Tigers 45-21. Albert Cesare / Advertiser (Photo: .) \nLashlee said Sunday night that the coaching staff has seen evidence that Johnson’s confidence is back to where it was when he was a backup option to Nick Marshall the previous two seasons. Lashlee mentioned as an example of Johnson being able to turn it around that Florida State quarterback Charlie Ward had eight interceptions in the first two games of the 1992 season. Ward had 15 interceptions in the first seven games of the 1992 season but would go on to win the Heisman Trophy the next season. \n“(Jeremy) would be the first to tell you that LSU wasn’t his best day (and) it wasn’t, but you’d like to think when a guy responds, wants to keep fighting and competing like he has,” Lashlee said. “He hasn’t laid it down. I think that’s the first sign there is an opportunity for him to regain confidence, and hopefully perform at the level he is capable of playing at.” \nAuburn quarterback Sean White (13) falls during a run during the NCAA football game between Auburn and Mississippi State on Saturday, Sept. 26, 2015, at Jordan-Hare Stadium in Auburn, Ala. Mississippi State Bulldogs defeated Auburn 17-9.

According to when cfbstats.com, when Auburn is in a possible scoring situation (within the opponents’ 40-yard-line or in), White is 2 of 7 for 32 yards with an interception. In the same scenario, Johnson is 13 of 20 for 139 yards with four touchdowns and one interception.

Johnson has six interceptions in three games but White was involved in numerous fumbles that were recovered by the offense but called “unacceptable” by Lashlee the following day. \n“Now protecting the football is a big thing for us,” Lashlee said. “Not only as an quarterback but as an offense. I believe in both of those guys. I really do. I haven’t given up on them because I know what they got in them and I like the way they’ve approached practice lately, and competing and preparing. All you can do is keep working, keep pushing through and make something happen.” Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1LpZ0Od Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:09:45.302+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
