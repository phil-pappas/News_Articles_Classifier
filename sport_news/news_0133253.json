Its excitement was apparent Wednesday, teasing the announcement on social media before releasing an interview with the player at 1 p.m.\nHoilett, who played in the English Premier League before the Rangers were relegated to the Championship last season, has long been on the CSA’s radar. But he was also eligible to represent Jamaica through his parents and perhaps even England, where he has lived since the age of 13 after moving overseas to join the Blackburn Rovers’ youth side.\nOnce the midfielder picked a country, there was no changing sides.\nHe played coy with the Toronto Star back in 2011 when asked which senior national team he would represent.\n“I’m a Canadian, of course … (but) it’s nice to have options,” he said at the time, politely refusing to comment on his international plans.\nOn Wednesday, Hoilett said men’s national team head coach Benito Floro played a part in him ultimately choosing Canada.\n“We sat down prior to the decision and he was just giving me confidence, telling me to just be out there, be happy, play your game, we already know what you can do and just be comfortable when you are out there.”\nHoilett was only the sixth Canadian to score a goal in the Premier League , according to soccer author and historian Colin Jose, a highlight-reel strike from distance that helped his then-side Rovers seal a 2-0 win over West Bromwich Albion back in January 2011.\nHe joined the Rangers in July 2012, signing a four-year contract. The Bramptonian has only played for the London-based club twice this season but coach Floro praised Hoilett’s importance within the squad, saying his attacking prowess is something the Canadian side currently lacks.\n“He runs well with the ball and likes to shoot on goal. He comes in at the right time for both the team and himself.\nHoilett’s first appearance in red and white could come in an international friendly against Ghana on Oct. 13 at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C.\nThat match will act as preparation for the squad ahead of the next round of FIFA World Cup Qualifiers, which kicks off Nov. 13 at BC Place in Vancouver.\nOn his first day on the job, the midfielder was already imploring Canadian fans to show up for the upcoming matches.\n“We have important games coming up, show your support and be the 12th man that help us move forward, win games and move the Canadian Soccer Association forward.”\nIn the meantime, Canada’s under 23 team kicks off its quest for a spot at next summer’s Olympics Thursday. The team’s first match of the CONCACAF Olympic qualifying tournament against rivals USA in Kansas City kicks off at 9 p.m.\nThe top two teams in the tournament with automatically qualify for Rio 2016, with the third-place winner advancing to an intercontinental playoff against Colombia.\nWith files from Dave Feschuk\nMore on thestar.com\nMaple Leafs goalies Bernier, Reimer in close race for starting job\nToronto Blue Jays fans countdown to AL East title", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:52:35.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
