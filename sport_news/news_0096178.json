Facing a crushing loss, the Twins scored a run in the eighth to tie it and then two unearned runs in the ninth off Cody Allen (2-5) to pull within one game of idle Houston for the second wild-card berth with three games left. Orioles 6 Blue Jays 4 BALTIMORE — Toronto extended the celebration of its first AL East title in 22 years, resting its starters in a rain-marred loss to Baltimore. Although the Blue Jays are still dueling with Kansas City for the best record in the AL — a distinction that provides home-field advantage through the postseason — Toronto manager John Gibbons has placed a priority on keeping his players fresh. NATIONAL LEAGUE Phillies 3 Mets 0 PHILADELPHIA — Jerad Eickhoff struck out 10 in seven dominant innings, Darin Ruf hit a two-run homer and Philadelphia beat NL East champion New York to complete a three-game sweep. The Mets are tied with the Los Angeles Dodgers for home-field advantage in the division series, which begins next Friday. Mets reliever Hansel Robles has been suspended for three games for throwing near the head of a batter Wednesday after both teams had been warned. Dodgers 3 Giants 2 SAN FRANCISCO — Brett Anderson pitched two-hit ball into the eighth in his final regular-season start, and NL West champion Los Angeles wrapped up its road schedule with a victory over San Francisco. Tim Hudson allowed three runs and three hits in 2 1/3 innings in the final start of his 17-year big league career. Cubs 5 Reds 3 CINCINNATI — Austin Jackson hit a three-run homer, Anthony Rizzo added an RBI double and Chicago kept alive its slim hopes for home-field advantage in the wild-card game with a victory over Cincinnati. Braves name GM ATLANTA — The Atlanta Braves have promoted John Coppolella to general manager following three seasons as assistant GM. The move was announced by Braves president of baseball operations John Hart. The team said in a statement Coppolella has agreed to a four-year contract through the 2019 season, a term that will include the Braves' first three seasons at their new SunTrust Park.
