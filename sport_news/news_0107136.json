Off 18 wins and a trip to the semifinals of the MAAC Tournament, the Hawks will now add Oklahoma transfer Je’lon Hornbeak, redshirt freshman Micah Seaborn and freshman wing Pierre Sarr to the rotation. Additionally, junior guard Josh James (toe) and redshirt sophomore Greg Noack (concussion) are back.\nIf Rice wants, he can legitimately go 11 or maybe even 12 deep depending on how freshman big man Diago Quinn comes along. There isn’t a team in the MAAC with that type of depth.\nA writer from a different outlet asked me recently, ‘Does Monmouth have the dudes to win the MAAC?’ The answer is yes.\nQ: Is Je’lon Hornbeak the guy who can get Monmouth over the hump in March? — Anonymous\nA: It isn’t going to be a one-man job to get Monmouth to where it wants to go, but having Hornbeak in the mix and playing well certainly brings a different element to the roster.\nFollowing right foot surgery last October, the former four-star recruit out of Grace Prep in Texas debuted at practice on Jan. 8 and immediately brought a new intensity and toughness to the second unit going against the starters every day.\nNow eligible and set to make his Monmouth debut on Nov. 13 against UCLA at Pauley Pavilion, Hornbeak figures to be a big piece of the puzzle on both sides of the ball for a team that has designs on a big season.\nIs the ball going to Hornbeak in a tight spot with the game on the line? I certainly wouldn’t rule it out, depending on the situation. The times I have talked to him and seen him practice, he strikes me as an alpha-type kid who doesn’t mind having the ball in his hands in a huge spot. Remember, this is someone who played in two NCAA Tournaments at Oklahoma, starting 29 of 32 games as a freshman in 2012-13. Hornbeak isn’t going to shy away from the moment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:07:58.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
