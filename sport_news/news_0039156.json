Trying to predict what will happen in a single series is something close to pointless. And trying to predict what will happen in one baseball game, at almost any level, is definitely pointless.\nAdChoices Baseball games can easily be decided by one bad pitch or one lousy call or one lucky bounce, and even if one of the two teams playing in Tuesday’s AL Wild Card game were obviously and significantly better than the other, no reasonable fan could ever say with any confidence that the better club would win any given contest. The 2015 Phillies still won more than 1/3 of their games, after all.\nBut with all that in mind, here’s a look at five things to watch in Tuesday night’s AL Wild Card game between the Astros and Yankees in the Bronx:\n1. Concern over Dallas Keuchel’s splits © Provided by USA Today Sports Dallas Keuchel Much has been made, and perhaps much more will still be made, of the seemingly massive distinction between the Astros ace’s performance at home and on the road this season. Keuchel went 15-0 with a 1.46 ERA at Minute Maid Park in 2015 and 5-8 with a 3.77 ERA everywhere else. And, look: Maybe there’s something to that. Maybe something happened this season that turned Keuchel into Bob Gibson in Houston and Bob Tewksbury on the road.\nBut Keuchel’s home-road splits were far more reasonable just last year, and there’s not a lot of evidence that any pitcher would consistently be so disproportionately good — above and beyond park factors and the typical way players perform marginally better at home — in one location over another. More likely it’s a bit of a fluke: Keuchel’s a really, really good pitcher who just so happened to endure his worst starts while on the road this season.\n2. Masahiro Tanaka’s pitch count\n© Provided by USA Today Sports (PHOTO: Brad Penner/USA TODAY Sports Images) The Yankees’ ace had an up-and-down season in his second year in the Majors, working through a partial tear of the UCL in his pitching elbow to go 12-7 with a 3.51 ERA. Tanaka throws strikes and the Astros don’t take a lot of pitches, so that could play out a couple of ways: Maybe the aggressive Houston hitters make Tanaka pay for throwing pitches over the plate, or maybe he uses his control to get efficient outs and work deep in the game.\nEither way, obviously, Tanaka’s performance will have a huge impact on the Wild Card game: The Yankees’ bullpen is completely dominant in late innings thanks to Andrew Miller and Dellin Betances, but somewhat soft in the middle innings. If the Astros can chase Tanaka after five innings, they’ve got a chance to tack on some runs. If Tanaka leaves after seven with a lead, the game’s pretty much over.\n3. Home runs\n© Provided by USA Today Sports (PHOTO: Gregory J. Fisher/USA TODAY Sports Images) The Astros hit the second most home runs of any team in the Majors this year, and the most of any club after the start of September. The Yankees hit the fourth most homers in the Majors this year, and kept hitting them at a decent clip even as their bats went cold late in the season. Yankee Stadium is one of the Majors’ best parks for hitting home runs, so we can expect at least a couple of them.\nOne notable difference, though: Keuchel, due to his heavy ground-ball tendencies, is one of the hardest starters to hit home runs against. Tanaka, if he threw enough innings to qualify, would have the sixth highest rate of home runs per nine innings in the Majors.\n4. New versus old\n© Provided by USA Today Sports Carlos Correa This is a fun one: Astros rookie Carlos Correa has long drawn comparisons to Alex Rodriguez as another big, righty-hitting five-tool shortstop taken first overall in the draft out of high school. The Yankees still have the O.G. A-Rod. The Astros look like one of baseball’s next big things, and the Yankees spent most of the last 20 years as basically baseball’s biggest thing. The Astros featured the youngest group of position players in baseball this season, the Yankees had by far the oldest.\nMaybe the Astros’ youthful energy helps them outlast the tired Yankees, or maybe the Yankees’ experience and savvy allows them to outperform the untested Astros in a big spot. Or maybe, just maybe, the game will come down to….\n5.

(PHOTO: AP Photo/Noah Berger) If you think you’ve got a good way to predict what will happen in the MLB postseason, challenge yourself to think back as far as this time last year. The Giants, who sort of stumbled to the finish, went to Pittsburgh to play a hot Pirates team for the Wild Card. They won, then kept winning, and ultimately won the World Series. The Royals, who hadn’t really hit all season, all of a sudden caught fire offensively in October.\nWeird things happen all the time in baseball. One time Adam Kennedy hit three homers in a postseason game. Another time Randy Johnson hit a bird with a fastball. We know enough about the sport to recognize that incredibly unlikely events are an extremely fun part of the game, but we’ll never know enough to consistently predict which ones will happen and when. Maybe the Yankees get to Keuchel early and never look back. Maybe Evan Gattis drives in three crucial runs with the first three-walk game of his entire career. We just don’t know, but the good news is we don’t have to wait very long to find out.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=pit&lg=all&qual=y&type=8&season=2015&month=0&season1=2015&ind=0&team=0&rost=0&age=0&filter=&players=0", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2015.shtml"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:13:00.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
