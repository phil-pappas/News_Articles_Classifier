(Photo: Elaine Thompson, Associated Press) \nAllen Park — Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford won his appeal against the NFL for a fine related to the color of his cleats in Week 4.\nThe league levied a $5,787 fine last week for Stafford’s uniform violation after he wore all blue cleats against the Seattle Seahawks while most of his teammates wore shoes that were some combination of pink, black and white.\nStafford said he presented his case in a phone call Tuesday with Merton Hanks, the league’s vice president for football operations, which led to the fine being rescinded.\nStafford wore the same shoes last Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals, but said he had to color something in on the shoes after discussing them with someone who knew the league’s uniform policy. The problem against the Seahawks was the cleats had “too much blue,” said Stafford, and the Lions were wearing white jerseys with gray pants.\n“I understood, and I will move on with a new pair of cleats,” he said.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:58:00.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
