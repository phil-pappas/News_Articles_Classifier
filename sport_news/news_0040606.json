Photograph by: Jeff McIntosh , Edmonton Journal \nWith first-place in the CFL West Division on the line, the Eskimos and Stampeders staged a Battle of Alberta slugfest, not a shootout, with the Eskimos winning on points, 15-11, to move to 11-4 and take over first place in the West Division. \nWith the victory, Calgary’s first home loss this season, Edmonton has clinched a home playoff date, either in the West Semifinal on Nov. 15 or the Final on Nov. 22. But it’s the Final they’re gunning for now. \nEskimos safety Cauchy Muamba was the late-game hero for the Eskimos, picking off a Bo-Levi Mitchell pass on a Stampeders third-and-four gamble from the Edmonton 34 yard-line in the final two minutes. \n“I saw the ball in the air and I just wanted to get it,” Muamba said of the errant pass that was tipped by Eskimos defensive back Otha Foster. “It’s crunch time and (Mitchell’s) go-to guys are (Marquay) McDaniel and (Eric) Rogers, so I just had to do a process of elimination. \n“Otha did a great job of tipping the ball and I just had to scoop it.” \nA few plays earlier, Calgary successfully gambled on third and five from their own 26-yard line, Mitchell finding receiver Rogers for a 30-yard gain down the sideline. \nDivisional implications \nYes, there are three regular-season games remaining, but winning is a major first step toward a first-place finish at season’s end for the Eskimos and a bye to the West Final. \nBoth the Eskimos and Stampeders have 11-4 won-lost records, but Edmonton has the tiebreaker, having defeated Calgary two of the three times the teams have met this season. \nEdmonton also has a regular-season bye in the final week of the season. So, should the Eskimos wind up in first place, they’d have a three-week break from game action — from Nov. 1 when they wrap up the regular season in Edmonton against the Montreal Alouettes until that Nov. 22 Final. \nIt could be a mixed blessing, as such respites can be, the old rest-versus-rust argument. But such a hiatus also would provide plenty of time for various nicks and bruises to heal. \nReilly offensive revival \nSince returning from a knee injury suffered in the season opening game, Reilly’s performance had been in and out at quarterback. \nHis best game was a 352-yard, three-touchdown pass tour de force in the Labour Day rematch on Sept. 12 in Edmonton, a game the Eskimos won 27-16. \nOn Saturday, Reilly moved the Eskimos consistently in the first half, completing 20 of 26 pass attempts for 202 yards and a 33-yard TD pass to Kenny Stafford. \nHe also threw two first-half interceptions. \nThe Eskimos gained 14 first downs in the first half to just five for Calgary. In the end, Reilly clicked on 29 of 40 passing attempts for 264 yards, meaning the Eskimos gained just 62 yards passing in a second half dominated by two superb defences. \nAll Cornish, all the time \nThe Stampeders produced a grand total of 97 yards net offence in the first half, with Cornish getting five carries for 19 yards. \nIn the second half, Stampeders quarterback Bo-Levi Mitchell’s plan was clearly to feed Cornish early and often. The 30-year-old running back, an Eskimos killer many times over, carried for 11 yards on Calgary’s first play of the second half, 15 yards on their second. \nWith 6:27 left in the fourth quarter, Cornish ripped off a 12-yard carry to extend a Stampeders drive. Still, the Eskimos defenders kept him mostly quiet, despite Cornish’s 53 rushing yards in the second half. \nDee-fence, both ways \nAfter Calgary won the Labour Day Classic by 16-7 and Edmonton won 27-16 in the rematch, if you were expecting a festival of scoring in the rubber match, you were sorely disappointed. \nThere were plenty of big plays by both defences. Eskimos’ Dexter McCoil broke up a Mitchell to Cornish passing attempt with a fair but vicious tackle, preventing a big gain by Calgary, for example. \nOn a second-and-three play from Reilly to Corey Watson, the Eskimos receiver was flattened buy a flying tackle by Stampeders defensive back Fred Bennett. That play made the difference between a first down and an Eskimos punt. \nAt halftime, the score was 14-10 Edmonton, but both defences stiffened in the second half. The teams combined for one point in the third quarter, a punt single by Calgary’s Rob Maver. They added just one more in the fourth, a punt single by Sean Whyte. \nThe Eskimos defence pitched a shutout in the crucial fourth quarter. \nWhy no kick? \nOn the final play of the first half, Eskimos head coach Chris Jones opted to take a shot at a touchdown, rather than have Whyte attempt a field goal that would have widened Edmonton’s lead to 17-10 at the time. \nAfter all, placekicker Whyte already had nailed a 43-yard field goal. And a missed attempt probably would have flown deep into the Calgary end zone, if not right through it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:49:45.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
