Another was the language barrier. \n“To teach and have to stop and have someone translate for you, you definitely felt like you couldn't be as in depth because it took double the time,” Gritz said. \nFor that reason, Gritz said her group, which plans to return to participate in the Give and Teach program next year, will pair up with Guatemalan teachers throughout the coming year in an effort to make their work have a larger impact. \n“We will email, we will Skype, we will share ideas so that when we go to them you'll basically have your partner that you've built a relationship with all year,” she said. \nThe group also spent time all week building a house for a Guatemalan family and touring schools in the area. \nGritz said one of the schools was very rural, and conditions there were eye-opening. \n“Four wooden walls and drapes, but the kids were happy, the kids loved school,” she explained. \nThe group from Sugar Creek was so impacted by the poverty in Guatemala, they've decided to get students and families here in Fort Mill involved. Gritz said they'll partner with the school's PTO in order to host a tennis shoe drive in November. New and gently used shoes will be collected in order to give to the Guatemalan children when the group returns next summer. \nThe overall goal, Gritz said, is to connect globally and show children here in Fort Mill what it means to have compassion for people who come from an entirely different background. \nGive and Teach aims to eliminate poverty in Guatemala. The organization not only helps improve teaching standards, and therefore the future earning potential of students, but also helps build homes, chicken coops, and stoves. The organization also helps provide food, eye exams and water filtration systems to families in need. \nKatie Rutland: mkrutland@comporium.net @kt_belle \nSee the slideshow \nThe group from Sugar Creek Elementary took some photos and made a slide show presentation of their trip.
