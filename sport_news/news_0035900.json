Those were both career highs for Paul in his major junior career. \nMeanwhile, Lindberg is coming off his one and only year in the OHL. The former fourth-round pick scored 32 goals and added 46 assists playing for the OHL's Oshawa Generals. \nFor both it'll be bit of a transition to play against bigger more physical players at the AHL level, but coach Luke Richardson is excited to see what they can do. \n\"It'll be fun to see them play. They've shown some real signs of flash already and they're had some great success in the past, so we see no reason why that type of player with their type of passion as a hockey players and people,\" said Richardson. \"They're going to want to do that same thing again and they'll rise to the occasion.\" \n\"It has been a long process ever since I was a kid, but obviously these are the things that I strive for and the goals that I set for myself,\" said Paul. \"Right now I've reached them and I've got to set my bar even higher. That is one thing I think I do well in is setting my goals high and trying to reach them the best that I can.\" \nThat first game for the B-Sens on Saturday is at home against Albany.
