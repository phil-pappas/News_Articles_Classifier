It was about big plays, just giving up large chunks of yardage via the run — (like the) first snap of the ball game — or via long throws. We’ve kind of drifted back that way. We had captured that issue.” \nThe Horned Frogs gained just 89 yards on the other 36 plays in the game, averaging less than 2.5 yards per play. \nThe Wildcats came into the game holding opponents to 71 rushing yards per game, and allowed the Horned Frogs to rack up 242 yards on the ground. \nK-State has rarely played at full strength on defense this season, and the depth of the secondary was tested more last Saturday than it has been all season. \nDespite the issues with health, Sndyer said it isn’t the major issue of concern on defense, and not an excuse for big plays. \n“It’s easy for me to say we’ve got to stop big plays,” he said. “It’s a matter of being able to say how are we going to do it? That’s what our defensive coaches are working on diligently, all of us are. It’s having a method of being able to correct the mistakes that cause those big plays. That’s probably the biggest hang up that we have right now.” \nSenior linebacker Will Davis said it boils down to better preparation in practice and focus during games. Davis acknowledged big plays have been a killer for the Wildcats, and a contributing factor in blowing halftime leads over the past two weeks. \nEven against Louisiana Tech, a handful of big plays helped the Bulldogs force the Wildcats into overtime at home. \nDavis said the focus this week has been on limiting and eliminating big plays. \nThe results of the past few games, however, have lingered in both positive and negative ways. \n“It’s extremely frustrating, but it’s also motivating for a lot of us,” Davis said. “We don’t want to be those guys. We want the game to be on our shoulders and we want to be able to provide that win. \n“It will hurt your mindset, but at the same time a lot of the guys are hungry and motivated.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:32:49.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
