A recovered fumble led to a touchdown, a blocked punt return by senior Will Bolton led to a second and the third, well, the third you had to see for yourself.York QB Damon Kaliff was under more pressure than the House of Representatives trying to cut spending when the ball sort of popped out of his hand and into the air. Enter Aurora senior inside linebacker Kyle Schmidt . Keep in mind, Kyle's main job on defense is to plug the running lanes, so when he grabbed the ball with 70 yards of green turf in front of him things got sort of interesting.Inside linebacker. You figure he's going to make it, say, 30 yards or so before the wheels come off. With a running back in pursuit the big boy, all 6-2 and 220 pounds of him, just wouldn't be caught. It wasn't all that pretty but Schmidt made it to the east end zone, a score that gave Aurora a three-touchdown lead.York staged a gallant comeback, in part thanks to a 63-yard TD pass with 37 seconds left in the first half and a 67-yard TD pass with 26 seconds left in regulation, but came up just short in this classic battle of Class B unbeatens.Going into the game this felt like an even match where big plays would tell the tale. Aurora got more of them, and early, and with that the Huskies enter the Class B playoffs a perfect 9-0 in the first year of the Kyle Peterson era.* Thursday night I felt a little bit like Noah from the Bible as I drove to Burwell, rain coming down in sheets on the way up, during parts of the game, and certainly on the way home.During a dry stretch I was on the field, doing my thing, taking pictures and trying to stay out of the way best I could, when I saw something remarkable - the pass defense played by Amherst senior Breyden Eckhout .In a game filled with outstanding players - both Amherst and Burwell were unbeaten going into the game - it was Eckhout's man-to-man defense on Burwell all-state receiver Ty Chaffin that set the table for the Broncos' 34-21 win over Burwell.Field conditions and the rain that caused them were a factor but in the end Eckhout's defensive performance swung the game in his team's favor, IMO.* In another Thursday battle of unbeatens, East Butler dominated Lourdes Central Catholic, 52-18.If you were to seat a table of the top eight-man football players for 2015, you'd want to tip a chair forward against it for East Butler senior Skyler Ratkovec . The kid is as good as it gets at the quarterback position, both running and passing the ball, and his resolve and will to win have elevated that program to top-notch standing.* Class A gave us a Friday night special, another battle of unbeaten teams, as Bellevue West survived a good challenge from Omaha Central, winning 41-25.Central hadn't played the caliber of schedule Bellevue West had, so there was some question about how competitive the game might be, given how Bellevue West had dominated most of its opponents. But one thing about it, Central's Jay Ball is an outstanding coach, and his team has plenty of talent on both sides of the ball; that the Eagles represented well, for the most part, is no surprise.With the win, Bellevue West further endorsed the idea this could be a stat title. Now for the scary part. The Thunderbirds open the postseason as Class A's No. 1 seed and will unofficially host Lincoln North Star in the first round. By earning the top seed it will avoid Millard West until the final, if both teams make it that far, but both Millard North and Central will be in same half of the bracket as Bellevue West, providing a challenge when, and if (and it will), comes to be.
