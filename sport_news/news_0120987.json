But the Lake Travis product wrested the job from Trevor Knight in the offseason and has looked impressive to start. The former walk-on broke an Oklahoma school record with 572 yards of total offense. Perhaps more impressive than his total production was his efficiency. Mayfield completed 32 of 38 passes for 487 yards and four touchdowns, while adding touchdown runs of 39 and 8 yards to set the tone early. Oklahoma's defense struggled against Phil Montgomery and the Tulsa Golden Hurricane, but Mayfield ensured the Sooners would pick up a victory and move up once again in the Associated Press poll.\nHonorable mention: QB Jerrod Heard, Texas (20-for-31 for 364 yards; 24 rushes for 163 yards, 3 TDs in 45-44 loss to Cal); WR Reginald Davis, Texas Tech (5 catches for 115 yards, 2 TDs in 35-24 win over Arkansas); QB Trevone Boykin, TCU (21-for-30 for 454 yards, 5 TDs; 11 rushes for 50 yards, TD in 45-37 win over SMU); WR Josh Doctson, TCU (5 catches for 171 yards, 2 TDs in 56-37 win over SMU); RB Chris Carson, Oklahoma State (17 carries for 104 yards, 2 TDs in 69-14 win over UTSA)\nOn Twitter:\n @ShehanJeyarajah", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ShehanJeyarajah"], "published": "2015-09-21T06:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:54:49.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
