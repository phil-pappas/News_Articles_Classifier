The ball bounded into the end zone and went over the back line for a touchback and Seattle’s ball at the 20. Seattle wide receiver Doug Baldwin, center, celebrates with teammate Jimmy Graham after Baldwin scored a touchdown in the first half Monday against Detroit in Seattle. The Seahawks won, 13-10. The Associated Press Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → \nRussell Wilson was sacked six times and pulled numerous escape acts, but threw a TD pass to Doug Baldwin in the first half and Steven Hauschka hit a pair of field goals from 50-plus yards as Seattle evened its record at 2-2. \nCOLTS: Andrew Luck did some light work during the media portion of Monday’s practice. \nHe tossed a few very short screen passes and handed off a few times. Whether he’ll do much more – or any more – Thursday night at Houston is still unclear. \nLuck did not speak with reporters after Sunday’s 16-13 overtime victory, which he sat out because of an injured right shoulder, or before practice Monday. He is expected to take questions Tuesday. \nMatt Hasselbeck replaced Luck on Sunday, was 30 of 47 with 282 yards and one touchdown, and would likely start again Thursday if Luck can’t play. \n• Lucas Oil Stadium officials say they have made sure a locker room access mistake following Sunday’s game in Indianapolis won’t be repeated. \nA male usher stopped three female journalists from entering the Jacksonville Jaguars locker room before asking other men if it was OK to allow them inside. \nPublic relations staffs from both teams apologized to the women following the Colts’ 16-13 overtime victory. Stadium director Michael Fox also apologized Monday. \nBUCCANEERS: Kyle Brindza has missed his last kick for Tampa Bay. \nThe young kicker’s struggles the past two weeks cost him his job, a day after the rookie from Notre Dame missed two field-goal attempts and an extra point during a 37-23 loss to NFC South rival Carolina. \nRAMS: Outside linebacker Alec Ogletree, the team’s leading tackler, will undergo surgery Tuesday for a broken right ankle and could be out for the season. \nCoach Jeff Fisher said the team would have a better idea after the procedure. He said Ogletree attended team meetings and was optimistic he could be placed on injured reserve/designated for return. \nRAVENS: Steve Smith, Baltimore’s leading wide receiver, injured his back in Thursday’s win against the Pittsburgh Steelers and is listed as day-to-day. Coach John Harbaugh declined to say whether Smith would be available for Sunday’s home game against Cleveland, but all signs point to the 15-year veteran missing the game. \nBEARS: Quarterback Jay Cutler seems over his hamstring problems. Chicago now has to worry about who’s available to block for him. \nThe loss of center Will Montgomery to a broken left fibula in Sunday’s 22-20 win over the Oakland Raiders left the offensive line scrambling, and the grouping for this Sunday’s game in Kansas City appears uncertain at best. \nTEXANS: Houston is sticking with Ryan Mallett as starting quarterback despite his recent struggles. \nMallett threw an interception and didn’t lead the Texans to any points before he was replaced by Brian Hoyer late in a 48-21 loss to the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday. \nHoyer threw two touchdown passes and directed three scoring drives late against a Falcons defense that had pulled most of its starters. Hoyer won the job out of camp, but was benched after one game in favor of Mallett. \nJETS: New York signed receiver Kenbrell Thompkins to the practice squad, and released wide receiver/kick returner Walter Powell from the practice squad. \nThompkins was signed by New England as an undrafted free agent out of Cincinnati in 2013 and caught 32 passes for 466 yards and four touchdowns as a rookie. \nHe played in two games the following season before being released and then claimed off waivers from Oakland. \n• Defensive lineman Sheldon Richardson is scheduled for a court appearance on charges of resisting arrest and traffic counts stemming from a police chase. \nMonday’s hearing in St. Charles County, Missouri, comes a day after Richardson completed a four-game suspension for violating the NFL’s substance abuse policy. \nGIANTS: New York is planning to place tight end Daniel Fells on injured reserve after discovering that he has a staph infection. \nFells has been bothered by an ankle injury in recent weeks and missed Sunday’s win over the Buffalo Bills. In evaluating the injury, it was discovered that he has a staph infection, which requires treatment.
