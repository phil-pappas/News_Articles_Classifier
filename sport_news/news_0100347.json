The second intra-squad scrimmage was a good performance by the veterans with some strong newcomer moments as well. “I think our execution offensively has gotten better,\" coach Matt McCall said. \"Now we need to get our legs back underneath us and start to build up that piece of it as we start to prepare for a game in two weeks. “I liked what I saw today. We shot the ball well from the 3pt line, did a pretty decent job taking care of the basketball…overall, I thought the energy was good and the execution on offense is getting better.” Stats were kept for the three 10-minute quarters, while the final period focused on special situations. Junior wing Tre’ McLean led four in double digits with 19 as the Gray topped White 65-51. McLean added a scrimmage-high seven rebounds along with seven rebounds, four assists and two steals in 28 minutes. Stat Leaders: Junior Tre' McLean : 19 pts, 7 reb, 4 ast, 2 stl, 8-8 shooting on 2pt attempts Senior Casey Jones : 11 pts, 4 reb, 6 ast Senior Eric Robertson : 13 pts, 4 ast, 5-7 FG, 3-5 3pt Senior Duke Ethridge : 15 pts, 5-6 FG, 3-4 3pt Freshman Peyton Woods : 9 pts, 3-5 3pt McLean was quick to deflect praise for his play. “Coach McCall has done a great job getting everyone to play with confidence,” he shared. “It's fun playing in this system. Every day I wake up, I'm excited about getting to work the team, getting to practice with the team.” The Mocs host Covenant in an exhibition game on Friday, Nov. 6.
