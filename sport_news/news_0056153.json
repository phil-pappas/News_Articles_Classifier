It's there,\" 5th District Commander Chris Goodly said.\nNOPD spokesman Tyler Gamble said detectives are looking into four to five specific cases.\n\"We don't rule anything in favor or out of favor without a definitive link. What we do do is use a common sense approach and if we believe it, that's what we prepare for and that's what our deployment strategy is there for,\" Goodly said.\nInvestigators say more evidence for the sexual assaults is being process at this time.\nNOPD released video of a masked man at an ATM. Detectives believes is responsible for one of the assaults.\nThe victim told police she awoke to the man standing beside her bed with a gun demanding money.\n\"What's happened the last week has been shocking to all of us,\" St. Roch resident Thomasine Bartlett said.\nThe shock for Bartlett her neighbors comes when attempted rape not far from her home was followed by a more vicious attack also near her home a week later.\nPolice say a man forced his way into a home on North Villere and raped a woman.\n\"It seems to have just come out of now where because we are all a neighborhood and we all look out for each other,\" Bartlett said. \"It's very comfortable in all four directions and it's like where did this person come from?\"\nNOPD says it has inundated the neighborhood with officers and arrested two people Wednesday night. One for a robbery and the other was caught during a burglary, according to police.\nDetectives did not say if either is suspected of the sexual assault investigations.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
