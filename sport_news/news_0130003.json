It will be vital to avoid losing the ball in midfield.” \nSevilla will look to rebound from yesterday’s 2-1 Champions League defeat at Manchester City when they host Getafe on Saturday. \nThe Europa League holders are, at the very least, expected to be challenging for the Champions League qualifying places this season but have started poorly in La Liga and are stuck down in 13th on nine points. \nCaptain Jorge Andujar said Sevilla’s performance at City, where they took the lead but were eventually undone by a 91st-minute Kevin De Bruyne winner, was proof of their potential. \n“You come away angry because you have played a great game,” he told reporters. “We can see that the team is making progress.” — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T13:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:51:27.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
