The ethics committee has not taken any key decisions, they are waiting for further investigations. There is no guilt impugned,” said Stöhlker. “They put the ball to Mr Lauber in Switzerland. He is now in position for further investigation. At least president Blatter has not flown away from his throne but is still in power. It’s a very difficult situation. It’s not good for global football.” \nMichael Lauber is the Swiss attorney general who last month said that Blatter was facing criminal investigation over the Warner contract and the payment to Platini, whose fate is also in the hands of the ethics committee. \nBlatter had promised to quit next February in the wake of an avalanche of corruption allegations but the move could effectively end his 17-year tenure as Fifa president and four decades at the heart of football’s global governing body. \nStöhlker, a Blatter loyalist, said that his Fifa career was not necessarily over. “He is quiet, he is reluctant, he is fully prepared to take his responsibilities,” he told the Guardian. “He is the only one who can lead Fifa. The picture for 90 days is not pleasant.” \nFifa has been in turmoil since May, when a series of dawn raids heralded the worst crisis in its history and US prosecutors indicted 14 individuals, including nine current or former Fifa officials, on charges of money laundering, racketeering and corruption. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
