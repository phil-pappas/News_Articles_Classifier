Big Mike In the Wood October 23, 2015 at 12:44   \nSo is this good news or bad news for Demarcus Cousins Olympic future? I know he wants to be on that team badly. za October 23, 2015 at 1:45 pm | Permalink \nSurely he won’t get left off this time Bluebros October 23, 2015 at 12:59   \nNot much of a drop off from Coach K to Pop! Future is looking bright for Team USA. Would have been nice to see Cal but really, not anyone else respected more in the NBA than Coach Popovich. I see a lot more gold in the future BBR October 23, 2015 at 3:43 pm | Permalink \nMajor improvement over krybaby. Glad to see him go. Biggest phony in the game. footblue October 23, 2015 at 1:04   \nGreat move. they will play real basketball! BAdams October 23, 2015 at 1:05   \nIt’s best it is an NBA coach. No recruiting advantages there. Plus, he’s one of the best. JaredCarterIsMyHomeboy October 23, 2015 at 1:06   \nHe could always croak before then. That’s a long time off, and Pop isn’t getting any younger. Side Show Bob October 23, 2015 at 1:20   \nGood choice. I was wrong (that’s happened once before). I didn’t think he would be chosen because of his age. He’s a proven winner who is respected by everyone is the game. He’ll probably only be around for an Olympics maybe two. I could be wrong….again. UKBlue October 23, 2015 at 1:22   \nYea the powers that be were never ever ever going to allow Cal to be the coach. Lol October 23, 2015 at 2:05 pm | Permalink \nWhat? Pop vs. Cal and you think it’s politics? Pop is widely regarded as the best coach in the NBA and one of the best of all time.
