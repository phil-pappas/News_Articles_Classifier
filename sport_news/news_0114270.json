One features a dominant rotation, the other a shutdown bullpen. One has premier power in the middle of the lineup, the other is a contact-hitting group that simply tries to keep the line moving.\nAdChoices On paper, this figures to be a fascinating and evenly matched series, with no shortage of story lines.\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE\n© Provided by New York Daily News Terry Collins watches his team workout at Citi Field as the Mets prepare to face the Royals in the World Series. - Julie Jacobson/AP ENDING A DROUGHT\nThe Royals haven’t won the World Series in 30 years, while the Mets have gone 29 years since their last title. One of these droughts will end by next week, giving a long-suffering fan base their first championship in more than a generation.\nGetting to the World Series has been a huge step for the Mets, who last appeared in the Fall Classic 15 years ago. The Royals are back for a second straight year, and after falling to Madison Bumgarner and the Giants last season, Kansas City is trying to get over the final hump.\nSTRIKEOUT ARTISTS\nMets pitchers are averaging more than nine strikeouts per game during the postseason, led by Jacob deGrom (27 K in 20 innings), Noah Syndergaard (20 in 13 innings) and Matt Harvey (16 in 12.2 innings).\nThe Royals have fanned more than 10 batters per game in October, as seven different pitchers have recorded double-digit K totals in their 11 games.\nBut what about the hitters? The Mets struck out 94 times in nine games, while the Royals whiffed only 71 times in their 11 contests. New York’s staff benefited from the free-swinging Dodgers and Cubs, but the Royals — who struck out less than every other team in the majors this season — are a contact-heavy team that won’t go down swinging quite as easily.\nWHAT MOMENTUM\nBoth teams had plenty of momentum after capturing their respective league pennants, but the Mets will have gone six days between games by the time they step on the field at Kauffman Stadium for Game 1 Tuesday night, while the Royals will have had three days off.\nThe pitchers on both sides will benefit from the rest, but can the hitters — namely Daniel Murphy — maintain their momentum after the lengthy layoff?\n“I don’t really feel like it’s going to hinder us,” Mets hitting coach Kevin Long said. “We had the same kind of break before we started the playoffs.”\nMurphy has homered in six straight games dating back to Game 4 against the Dodgers, hitting .421 with a 1.462 OPS, seven homers, 11 RBI and 11 runs scored during the playoffs.\nROYAL ALLIES\nThe Mets never trailed during their four-game NLCS sweep of the Cubs, leaving no need for them to mount any late-game rallies. The Royals have made those type of rallies their calling card this postseason.\nKansas City posted a five-run, eighth-inning rally to stay alive against the Astros in Game 4, then erased a three-run deficit in Game 2 against the Blue Jays, posting a five-spot against David Price. Then after blowing a two-run lead in the top of the eighth in Game 6 against Toronto, the Royals bounced right back with a run in the bottom of the inning that helped clinch the pennant.\nBULLPEN BLUES\nThe Mets’ starters have dominated this postseason with a 2.25 ERA, while the Royals’ rotation has sputtered to the tune of 5.56. Kansas City’s bullpen? That’s another story.\nWade Davis and Kelvin Herrera have allowed one run between them over 15.1 innings, striking out an incredible 26 batters. Luke Hochevar hasn’t allowed a run in 5.2 innings.\nJeurys Familia has been unhittable in the playoffs (9.2 scoreless innings), but if the Mets’ young starters get knocked out early, the bridge to him — Tyler Clippard, Addison Reed and Bartolo Colon — is shaky.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.nydailynews.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:09:31.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
