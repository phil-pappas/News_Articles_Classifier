This one, however, was perhaps the most painful. For the third game in a row, the Eagles couldn't hold onto a two-touchdown lead and their valiant effort against top-ranked Lindsey Wilson came up just short. The Blue Raiders outscored 18th-ranked Faulkner 21-3 in the second half and escaped with a 24-19 victory here Saturday afternoon in a Mid-South Conference West Division showdown. Faulkner (3-3 overall, 0-3 MSC West) built a 16-3 halftime lead over Lindsey Wilson (6-0 overall, 1-0 MSC West), but it could have easily been more. The Eagles made four trips deep into the Blue Raiders' red zone in the opening two quarters, but came away with only three Hunter Kennamer field goals. A fourth drive down close resulted in an interception of Faulkner quarterback Clayton Nicholas at the goal line. Lindsay Wilson picked off three more Nicholas passes in the second half, all coming in Blue Raider territory that thwarted the Eagles' upset efforts. The Eagles dominated the game in every phase except the most important one - on the scoreboard. Faulkner had 434 total yards to just 236 for Lindsey Wilson, and Boren's team had 31 first downs to the Blue Raiders' 31-18. Through all the adversity, Faulkner was still on top 19-17 after Kennamer's fourth field goal in four attempts was true, this one from 38 yards out with 10:24 left in the game. Lindsey Wilson then used a little trickery to regain the lead for good, with receiver Tyrone Stallard taking a pitch in the backfield and then throwing deep to a wide open Zak Mizell who raced to the end zone from 45 yards out for the go-ahead score with 6:50 on the clock. After an exchange of punts, the Eagles took over at their own 30 with 1:56 left. Nicholas hit Rob Lockhart for 26 and 16 yards on back-to-back plays to give Faulkner hope, moving the ball to the Blue Raider 28 with 1:22 to play. A procedure penalty moved it back five yards, and two incomplete passes sandwiched a short completion, leaving the Eagles with a fourth-and-7 from the Blue Raider 25. Nicholas was forced out of the pocket and his throw on the run intended for A.J. Stevenson was intercepted by Joe Lewis to end Faulkner's hopes. \"We obviously played well enough that we should have won the football game,\" Boren said. \"The guys played their hearts out and gave tremendous effort. I'm also very happy with the job our coaches did in getting them ready to go play. The game came down to red zone efficiency, and we had to settle for too many field goals rather than touchdowns. And a couple of trips we didn't get anything, and that was the difference. \"On one of our interceptions when we were driving deep in their territory, Lindsey Wilson was offsides and we thought we had a free play but no flag was thrown. That killed us.\" Nicholas was 35-of-62 for 386 yards and a touchdown, it coming late in the first half to Lockhart. The senior wideout had six catches for 115 yards, while Stevenson finished with eight catches for 105 yards. Jonathan McNair led the Eagles with nine receptions, resulting in 54 yards, while Josh Gross added seven more for 88 yards. Tailback Joe Jones added 70 yards on the ground on 22 carries. Kennamer's four successful kicks now pushes him to 11 makes in 12 field goal tries on the season. \"Hunter did a great job today,\" Boren said. \"We just wish we hadn't had to rely on him so much. We needed touchdowns to beat them, and we just weren't able to convert.\" The Faulkner defense stuffed the Lindsey Wilson running game all afternoon, allowing just 36 yards on 26 carries. Blue Raider quarterback Dylan Beasley threw for 191 yards, completing 16 of 28 attempts. Four Eagles - Keylan Smith, Dennis Thames, Caleb Taylor and Akil Teel - each had seven total tackles, with Smith and Ladarius Slocum each recording interceptions. Things started well for Faulkner. The Eagles received the opening kickoff and held it for 11 plays before the drive bogged down in the red zone. Kennamer's 31-yard field goal gave Faulkner a 3-0 lead at the 10:28 mark of the opening quarter. Early in the second quarter the senior place kicker culminated another long march, knocking through a 30-yarder to push the advantage to 6-0. The Blue Raiders cut the margin in half on its next possession, taking advantage of a short punt and a 24-yard return by Allen Cooks that took Lindsay Wilson into the red zone. The Faulkner defense stiffened, and Caleb Keeton's 33-yard kick made it 6-3 with 9:27 to play in the half. After Nicholas threw a red-zone interception at the goal line, the Eagles' defense forced a three-and-out, setting up the offense in great field position. On second down from the Blue Raider 24, the freshman quarterback hooked up with Lockhart for their ninth score connection of the season. Kennemer's point after with 2:54 left in the half pushed the Eagles' lead to 13-3. On the ensuing kickoff, the ball bounded off of a Lindsey Wilson upback and Faulkner's Jay Coleman recovered at the Blue Raider 28. The Eagles and Kennamer took advantage of the miscue, with his 27-yard field goal sending Faulkner to the locker room with a 16-3 lead. The first-half domination wasn't just on the scoreboard, with Faulkner outgaining Lindsay Wilson 228 yards to just 85, and amassing 19 first downs to the Blue Raiders' eight. Faulkner hosts Bethel (Tenn.) for Homecoming next Saturday afternoon at Billy D. Hilyer Stadium. The kickoff for the MSC West Division battle is set for 1:30 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:25:35.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
