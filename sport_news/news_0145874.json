Illinois (4-1, 1-0 Big Ten) trailed by 10 at the half and never led until Allison's late touchdown catch. Place-kicker Taylor Zalewski converted the extra point after missing two first-half field goals. Lunt, a Rochester High School graduate, finished the day 23 of 45 for 251 yards and two touchdowns, the first a 22-yarder to Marchie Murdock early in the final quarter. Allison caught eight passes for 91 yards and the winning touchdown, which was set up by Lunt's 50-yard pass to Sacred Heart-Griffin graduate Malik Turner. Nebraska (2-3, 0-1 Big Ten) led 10-0 at the half. Backup Nebraska running back Devine Ozigbo led the Cornhuskers with 70 yards on seven carries and a touchdown. The win was Illinois' first against Nebraska since 1924.
