Three-run shot.\" \n\"It's fun to see the Jays back in the playoffs,\" Giroux, a native of Hearst, Ontario, said Friday. \nThe team didn't find out the Blue Jays won until after finishing off its own 3-0 win over the Blackhawks. The TVs went off after the seventh inning. \n\"After the home run, you just hoped for the best,\" said Schenn, who played \"everywhere\" on the baseball field as a kid. \nThe Flyers have 14 Canadians on their 23-man roster, including Sean Couturier, who was born in Phoenix but lived most of his life in Canada and competes for the neighbors to the north in international play. \nGiroux said almost all of them are pulling for the Jays. \nSimmonds is from Scarborough, a district and former municipality within Toronto, east of the area of town that houses Rogers Centre, where practically the whole country had its eyes focused Wednesday afternoon. \nHe used to watch games with his \"Nana,\" Catherine Mercury, who passed away from breast cancer when Simmonds was 7. He credits his grandmother for being the reason he got into baseball and the Blue Jays as a kid. He played baseball until about high school, he said. He was a first and third baseman that \"liked the hot corner.\" \nNana's favorite player, of course, was Joe Carter. Not a popular name in this city. \n\"She's why I have a vested interest,\" Simmonds said. \"I wear my Jays hat around here (Philadelphia) and everyone chirps me everywhere I go. I'm born and raised in Toronto and the Blue Jays have always been my team. It's nice to see what they're doing right now.\" \nThe Blue Jays, in the playoffs for the first time since Carter hit that memorable home run against the Phillies to win the 1993 World Series, opened up their ALCS series with the Kansas City Royals Friday night. \n\"I like their chances,\" Flyers winger Sam Gagner said. \nGagner played until he was about 12, he said. He was mostly a catcher. He's still a big fan. \n\"I went to a game against the Royals this summer, was right at the field level and got to see a lot of the action,\" he said. \"It's a good rivalry. The one game the benches cleared. It should be a fun series and I'm excited to see how it goes. \n\"I went to a bunch of games this summer that were sold out and you haven't seen that in past summers.\" \nIt's not just the city of Toronto that's excited. The Blue Jays are the only MLB franchise in Canada, so it goes well beyond one city. \nTake Schenn for example. He's from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, nearly 3,000 kilometers from Toronto. \n\"I have tons of buddies back home that are huge Jays fans,\" Schenn said. \"They're diehards. It's funny, we're 24 hours away from Toronto and maybe they'll see one game every two or three summers, but they're still watching it on TV every day. \n\"It's coast-to-coast. It's a huge buzz around Canada.\" \nOn Twitter: @Jeff_Neiburg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:14:26.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
