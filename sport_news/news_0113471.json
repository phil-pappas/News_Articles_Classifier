It’s too early, he says, to be talking lineups and rotations. \n“This is going to sound like a coaching cliché,” Donovan said. “But I’m not really right now wrapped up in who’s starting and who’s not. What I’m really wrapped in is trying to get them to understand philosophically what we’re trying to do.” \nBut there are obvious position battles on this team. Four of them. And there are some early signs as to who might have the upper hand. \nHere’s a closer look at each one: \nStarting shooting guard: Andre Roberson vs. Dion Waiters vs. Anthony Morrow \nIn a completely unrelated conversation on Wednesday, Russell Westbrook may have accidently hinted that Roberson — the incumbent at shooting guard — may again earn that title. Asked about matching up against Roberson in practice, Westbrook said that rarely happens: “Dre’s always on my team.” In scrimmages, basketball coaches typically line up their starters against backups, done as a way to create court chemistry between players who will commonly be in the same lineups. \nIf Roberson indeed wins the starting job, it would mesh with what the Thunder has typically done at that spot in the past. Donovan, channeling his inner Scott Brooks, said it’s important to establish a “defensive identity” early in games. Roberson, clearly, is the Thunder’s best perimeter stopper. \nBut is he the best option to start? You could make an argument for Dion Waiters, who provides a better offense-defense balance than Roberson. But that would put Waiters, a player most effective when the ball is in his hands, on the court with the Thunder’s other two high-usage scorers. So a case could be made for Anthony Morrow, a perimeter sniper who would space the floor for Kevin Durant and Westbrook without needing a single play designed for him. But Morrow has his defensive limitations. \nWhich brings us back to Roberson, who, at this point, seems to be the clear favorite to keep his job. \nStarting center: Steven Adams vs. Enes Kanter \nSteven Adams sat out Thursday with a sore back. It’s not considered serious. He should return to practice soon. But it’s an interesting aspect of lineup predicting that anyone following the Thunder should be wary of at this point. Injuries happen. And when they do, hands are forced and flexibility is a must. \nBut if everyone’s healthy, contract numbers aside, Adams would seem to fit the Thunder’s starting lineup better. And that’s more about Enes Kanter. The Turkish big man has some polar opposite strengths and weaknesses. His offense could be leveraged better at times when either Durant or Westbrook is off the court. \nAnd his defense, presumably, won’t be as big an issue. Would you rather Kanter was battling DeMarcus Cousins or Kosta Koufas during a bulk of his minutes against the Kings? Or staring down the barrel of a DeAndre Jordan-Chris Paul pick-and-roll or a Cole Aldrich-Austin Rivers one? The latter sounds a bit more appealing for the Thunder. \nSecond reserve big: Nick Collison vs. Mitch McGary \nEnes Kanter dropped weight this offseason. He said it paid dividends. Mitch McGary cut pounds, too. About 20. And Kanter said he’s seen that pay dividends. “He’s looking faster, more athletic,” Kanter said. “I tell him, man, you shock me when you jump.” \nSports history is lined with cases of the sophomore slump, particularly in college. But there can also be a sophomore jump. Within the Thunder, the early expectation is McGary will experience one. He’s not only lighter and more energized, but he’s more comfortable navigating NBA life. \nMcGary flashed his potential last season, mashing together quick double-doubles in spurts. But his consistency and conditioning were an issue. The hope is that his new diet — McGary took cooking classes and cut out his beloved candy — will help him maintain his production. If so, that should slice away at Nick Collison’s minutes. \nBackup point guard: D.J. Augustin vs. Cameron Payne \nIt’s gotta be an awkward spot for a veteran entrusted to mentor his successor. Imagine if your boss asked you to teach the new guy all the tricks you’ve picked up over the years, to take him under your wing, just so that, sometime soon, he’ll be ready to take your job. That’s the case with Collison and, particularly, Augustin this season. \nThe veteran point guard is in the last year of his deal. He’s been on five teams the past three seasons. He has a wife and kids. He’d like to settle into a spot. But the development of Cameron Payne, the rookie he is happily tutoring, could eventually make him expendable. \nWe haven’t seen much of Payne. His pre-draft Murray State tape looks great. But that was the Ohio Valley Conference. His shoot looks smooth in post-practice workouts. But that’s in an empty gym without pressure. Players have seen him in scrimmages in recent weeks. They rave about him. “He’s better than I imagined,” Durant said. Donovan complimented his natural feel for the game. But the preseason will give us a better glimpse. Is this a wide-eyed project rookie or a potential impact player right away? \nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:05:47.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
