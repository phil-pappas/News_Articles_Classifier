But while the potential for distraction, a 25-15, 25-13 and 25-15 victory over Tucker, the No. 4 seed out of Area 2- was never in doubt. \nThe Lady Indians can now enjoy the rest of home- coming weekend before turning their attention to a Sweet 16 showdown on Tuesday at home against either North Gwinnett or Chattahoochee. \nEast Coweta head coach Amber McClure was able to go deep into her lineup and play some of her younger players. \n“It was good to be able to play some freshman and sophomores and give them that state tournament experience,” she said. \nDespite Thursday’s youth movement, East Coweta’s trio of seniors still carried the team. \nLibero Sydney Winters had eight digs and a team-high 14 kills. Middle hitter Dominique Ingram had two blocks and nine kills, while setter Peyton Smith finished with 27 assists. \nRiley Padgett posted three aces to pace the Lady Indians’ service game. \nBut when called on, East Coweta’s younger players also put up some impressive stats. \nFreshman Isabel Moller had eight digs and four aces. Nahla Muhammad ,who spent most of the season on the junior varsity, made the most of her first state tournament experience playing key role in the Lady Indi- ans first-round sweep finishing with seven digs and four aces. \nThe Lady Indians have played some of their best volleyball the past week. \nEast Coweta lost to rival Newnan during the regular season and went into last week’s Region 3- tournament as the No. 2 seed, but defended its region crown with victories that included a sweep of the Lady Cougars on Saturday. \nThe emotional victory has fired up the Lady Indians, but McClure has urged her team to keep their emo- tions in check. \n“We have to kind of take a step back now and realize, the regular season is over and it was great to win the region tournament,” she said. “But now we have to focus at the task at hand.” \nStaying focused wasn’t a problem against Tucker. \nEast Coweta used an early seven-point run to push a 9-2 lead with Padgett’s serving. \nAlthough Tucker closed the score to 15-13, the Lady Indians closed out the set with a similar 10-2 run. \nTucker led 2-0 in the second set, but any thought of an upset was quickly erased when Moller started serving for the Lady Indians and scored eight consecutive points to take control. \nEast Coweta’s pushed the margin to 17-6 for its biggest lead of the second set. \nTucker took brief control of the third set when it built a 5-2 lead, but Ingram ended the run with a back to back kills. \nThe Lady Indians went on a 6-0 run and never trailed again. \nEast Coweta joins Newnan in the Class Sweet 16. next week. \nThe Lady Cougars, who swept Rockdale County at home on Wednesday, will travel to face Area 7- champion Norcross. (32-14). \nNorcross swept Parkview 25-9, 25-13, 25-9 on Thursday at home.
