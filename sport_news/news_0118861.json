Ontario in an exhibition Friday CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nBecause of the way the calendar fell this year, and with the OK of the Ivy League, the Cornell men's hockey team has had a one-week head start on preparations for the upcoming season. \nIn addition, pre-training camp skills sessions — normally limited to a coach and six players at a time — were expanded so that the entire team could work with head coach Mike Schafer for the two-hour sessions each week starting in mid-September. \nThe Big Red has already been in formal preseason training for a week, and will take another step in its development Saturday when it takes part in the annual \"Red-White\" scrimmage. The event, which is free to the public and will include the 10th-ranked Big Red women's team, will begin at 7 p.m. at Lynah Rink. \nThe game will be played in two 30-minute halves, with the game starting with two shifts from the men's squad, followed by two from the women, and alternating that way throughout. There will be regular power-play situations and a shootout following regulation play. \nAt Wednesday's annual men's team \"Media Day,\" Schafer was his usual excited self as he looked forward to his 21st season behind the bench at his alma mater. He was especially happy about the special dispensation granted by the Ivy League, which gave him extra time on the ice with his players. \n\"It's been awesome,\" said Schafer, a 1986 Cornell graduate. \"Typically, we're on the ice for one week and then playing an exhibition game, so it's kind of a rush. This year, we've been able to kind of step back, start the year during fall break and really be able to break down some video and spend a little extra time with guys not in school.\" \nForward John Knisley, one of just four seniors on this year's Red, echoed his coach's sentiments. \n\"You see teams around the country playing games already, and getting the earlier start gives us another week to prepare,\" said Knisley, who scored five goals in 28 games last year. \"I know in years past, it's been pretty tough seeing other teams having two or three weekends of games, and we still really haven't gotten a crack at it, so guys are excited that we're out on the ice, and excited for the 'Red-White' game this weekend.\" \nThe Red's other three seniors are defenseman Reece Willcox, 6-foot-7 forward Christian Hilbrich and forward Teemu Tiitinen. The junior class is large, with nine players, including goalie Mitch Gillam, who last week was named to the Mike Richter Award Watch List. The award is given by the Let's Play Hockey organization, as well as the Herb Brooks Foundation. \nGillam finished among the nation's leading goaltenders last year, ending the year with a 1.99 goals-against average and a .927 save percentage. He is nursing a minor injury, and is not in either the Red or White lineup for Saturday's game. \n\"I think we're going to have a fast pace out there,\" said Gillam, who made history two years ago by becoming the first Cornell goalie to score a goal when he accomplished the feat in the final seconds of a 4-2 defeat of Niagara. \"We're just trying to figure out who plays well with the other guys. Our seniors are leading us pretty well, keeping us on our toes, so I think it'll be a fun game.\" \nCornell finished last season 11-14-6 overall, 9-9-4 in the conference, and was swept out of the ECAC Hockey playoffs at home by Union in the first round. After next weekend's home exhibition games with Laurentian and Ryerson universities, of Canada, the Red opens the season with a home-and-home set on Oct. 30 and 31 against Niagara. \nHead coach Doug Derraugh's CU women's team was scheduled to take on Western Ontario in an exhibition game Friday evening at Lynah. The Big Red is 10th in both the USCHO.com and USA Today/USA Hockey rankings, and is coming off a runner-up finish in the conference tournament. It missed the NCAA Tournament for the first time in six years. \nLed by seniors Brianne Jenner, Emily Fulton and Jillian Saulnier — who accounted for 56 of the team's 108 goals — the Cornell women finished 19-11-3 overall, 14-6-2 in the league, and lost 7-3 to Harvard in the conference title game at Clarkson. \nThis year's squad features six seniors, including defensemen Cassandra Poudrier and Morgan Richardson, forwards Jess Brown, Anna Zorn and Taylor Woods, and goalie Stefannie Moak. \nWOMEN'S HOCKEY NOTE: Five Cornell women's hockey alumnae — Rebecca Johnston (class of 2012, Laura Fortino ('13), Lauriane Rougeau ('13), Jessica Campbell '14 and Saulnier — have been named to the 22-player Canadian National Women's Team roster for the upcoming Four Nations Cup. The tournament is scheduled for Nov. 4 to 8 in Sunsvall, Sweden. All five players are veterans of international play, with Johnston, Fortino and Rougeau having won gold medals with Team Canada at the 2014 Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia. \nCornell hockey \nWhat: \"Red-White\" scrimmage, featuring men's and women's teams. \nWhen: 7 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:35:58.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
