More than 200 have said they will participate elsewhere in a virtual run.\nLast Monday, David Stevens was running on White Rock Lake Trail when he was violently attacked and killed. Click here to read the Crime Blog.\nOn Tuesday, Lynnlie Tuschoff asked in a Facebook post on the Dallas Running Club (DRC) marathon training page if anyone had heard of a memorial run for the runner killed the day before. At that point, Stevens had not been identified.\nNo event had been organized, but the overwhelming response from runners was that they would be interested in participating in something like that, Tuschoff said in an email. She then spoke with her friend and fellow runner Angelia Finnegan about organizing a grassroots gathering. Lots of ideas poured in including a \"silent mile.\"\nThe Memorial Run for David Stevens, created as a Facebook Event, calls for interested runners to gather at 6:30 p.m. Monday at the DRC Clubhouse, 1130 Beachview St., for a run. The run is not a sanctioned DRC event, though some of the organizers are club members.\nThe plan will be to meet back at the DRC Clubhouse at 7:30 p.m. for a candlelight vigil. Runners will turn left off of Poppy Drive onto the White Rock Lake Trail, and when runners turn to head back to the clubhouse, they will be a mile away, Tuschoff explained. There will be a marker indicating the beginning of the \"silent mile.\"\nFor the silent mile, runners will be asked to run silently, to cease talking and to shut off their music.\n\"Just focus on the somber reason for the evening,\" Tuschoff said.\nTuschoff said she initially figured about 40 or 50 people would be interested. By Wednesday, more than 100 had said they were coming. Many more expressed interest but aren't in the area so the virtual event was added Thursday.\n\"They can post their location and pictures of their run, maybe share their thoughts and condolences to the family,\" Tuschoff said.\nOn Twitter:\n @DFWRunning", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DFWRunning"], "published": "2015-10-19T05:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:48:22.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
