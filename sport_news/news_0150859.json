Shortstop Corey Seager, the closest infielder, was almost all the way toward second. \nTravis d’Arnaud followed with a sacrifice fly, and Murphy homered in the sixth for a 3-2 lead. \nMurphy had three hits off Greinke. Murphy batted .333 in the series and homered three times off Greinke and Clayton Kershaw. \nNew York quickly will turn its attention to the Cubs. The NLCS, which starts Saturday night at Citi Field, is the first postseason meeting between the teams. \nDeGrom (2-0) struck out seven and walked three to earn his second road win of the series. \nNoah Syndergaard pitched the seventh in the rookie’s first big league relief appearance, and Jeurys Familia got the first six-out save of his career. \nGreinke (1-1) gave up three runs and six hits in 6 2 / 3 innings. The right-hander, who led the majors with a 1.66 ERA, struck out nine and walked one.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:29:31.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
