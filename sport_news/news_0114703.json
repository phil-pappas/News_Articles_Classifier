The Cubs' payroll climbed back to $120.3 million, or 13th in the league, this year.\nThe Ricketts family bought 95 percent of the Cubs for $845 million and in March, Forbes magazine valued the entire club at $1.8 billion, the fifth highest in the league and up 50 percent from the prior year. The New York Yankees are No. 1 with an estimated value of $3.2 billion.\nThat increase in the team's value is partly driven by the funds pulled in at Wrigley, where the Cubs have the third highest ticket prices in the league and generate even more from concessions, according to research firm Team Marketing Report, which tracks the industry. Cubs tickets average almost $45 apiece, compared with a league average of nearly $29.\nAttendance at Wrigley Field, which can seat over 41,000 people, hit almost 3 million this season, good for sixth in the league. That is an increase of almost 12 percent from 2014, when the Cubs ranked 11th in attendance. The Cubs drew 3.3 million fans in 2008.\nBased on merchandise sales at MLB.com/shop, Cubs merchandise finished sixth overall in the league as sales rose 80 percent, baseball officials said. That was up from ninth place last year.\nTO THE VICTOR...\nWith the team's success, however, both attendance and ticket prices may continue to rise.\nFamous for its ivy-covered outfield walls and urban location where home run balls sometimes drop onto a residential street, Wrigley Field is a top tourist attraction and has been declared a city landmark. The ballpark is over 100 years old.\nThe Cubs last fall started the renovation of Wrigley, which will be completed in phases. It has included a controversial left field videoboard and a right field sign that were protested unsuccessfully in federal court by owners of rooftop bars across the street from the ballpark, who complained their views into the stadium would be blocked.\nThe project has also entails the addition of new bleachers, a new clubhouse, a restaurant and an outdoor plaza. It is expected to be completed by opening day in 2019.\n\"They've taken all the steps to turn the Wrigley area into a Cubs experience and they didn't do that just to make the fans happy,\" said Michael Cramer, director of the sports media program at the University of Texas and the former president of a group that previously owned the Texas Rangers baseball club.\nThe Ricketts family has said the renovations were needed to keep the team competitive.\nThe real big payoff is still to come, as the Ricketts plan to establish a Cubs regional sports TV network following the 2019 season.\nGiven the development of digital technologies, a Cubs network likely be worth more than the $3 billion at which the New York Yankees' YES Network was valued, analysts and bankers said.\n\"We look at ourselves as a baseball team first, but lots of businesses after that, and on the media side we're really excited about the future,\" Crane Kenney, the Cubs president of business operations, said in an interview.\n\"We're in the third inning of our plan,\" he added. \"We're very, very early in our growth cycle.\"\n(Additional reporting by Mary Wisniewski in Chicago and Steve Ginsburg in Washington, editing by G Crosse)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:21:19.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
