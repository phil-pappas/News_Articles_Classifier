The Fayetteville Sports Club Hall of Famer is also a veteran of the Scottish Highland Games. Posted: Monday, October 12, 2015 4:39 pm \nArnold Pope was a high school senior when he entered his first weightlifting competition, pumping iron in the novice division of a contest held at North Carolina's Woollen Gym in 1950. \n\"Just the adrenaline rush I got out of it,\" Pope said. \"I said, 'This is my sport.'\" \nSixty-five years later, the 83-year-old great-grandfather has finally stepped off the platform for the final time, announcing his retirement this month from the competitive circuit. \n\"I just didn't want to be sawdust cluttering up the platform,\" Pope said of his decision. \nThe Stedman resident has had an illustrious weightlifting career, amassing 59 titles at the state level or higher, including 13 U.S. Weightlifting Association National Masters Championships. \nHe won 27 state open titles before entering the 40-and-over Masters division, where he took 11 straight state championships. The latter total that doesn't include nine years when no state tournament was held before Pope went on to win the national competition. \nOne more number, just as significant as the others, is two: The number of times Pope has come back from retirement before, though he says no comeback will follow this exit. \nHe first retired in 1980. \n\"I told everybody that was 30 years in the sport, and that was enough,\" Pope said. \"But the real reason is that I got tired of competing against people half my age.\" \nThat was before the USWA established its Masters division, which allowed lifters over the age of 40 to compete in five-year age groups. \n\"That made life sound fair again,\" said Pope, who returned after about a five-year break. \"So, I got back into it, and I'm glad I did, because I won 11 straight national championships and one world during that period.\" \nHis success there eventually landed him in the National Masters Weightlifting Hall of Fame in 1998. \nPope, a retired Methodist minister, is also a 2013 Fayetteville Sports Club Hall of Fame inductee, and competed in the Scottish Highland Games for two decades. He represented United States in the World Caber Tossing Championships, held in Aberdeen, Scotland, a handful of times, and at a meet in Newburgh, Scotland, in 1970, he became the first American to win a caber-tossing event in that country. \nPope tried retirement from weightlifting a second time in 1998 after joint problems forced him to declare \"the rewards just weren't worth the pain.\" \nTwo hip replacements and a knee replacement followed. While Pope had sworn off competing during the time, he continued a regular weightlifting regimen in the gym at his Stedman home. \n\"Then it dawned on me one day, 'Heck, I'm lifting more weight in one workout out there in my gym than I ever would in a contest,'\" he said. \nPope said the joint replacements and age have now slowed him to the point that he can't meet his own expectations, and he's calling it quits for good this time. \nPope capped his career with a win at the N.C. Weightlifting State Championships in Greenville on Oct. 3. He finished first in the 105-kg-plus weight class in the 80-84 age group. \nHe received a Lifetime Service Award for his decades of success and commitment to lifting in North Carolina. \n\"It was really touching for me,\" Pope said. \"I just wanted to thank the people who were there, and also, the way they represented all the people through the years who had offered so much encouragement and support.\" \nPope's service to the sport isn't over yet. He said he'll continue to act as a judge in lifting competitions. He's been certified at the national level since 1973. \n\"That's one thing I pointed out in my retirement speech,\" Pope said. \"I'm not disappearing. I'm still going to hang around and help the game anyway I can.\" \nCommunity sports writer Jaclyn Shambaugh can be reached at 609-0651 or shambaughj@fayobserver.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:23:04.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
