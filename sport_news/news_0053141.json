But some of his other teammates aren't as lucky.\nThe Cavaliers will begin the season without star point guard Kyrie Irving and defensive menace Iman Shumpert, who will miss the first three months following wrist surgery.\nFollowing Wednesday's practice, Varejao talked about the challenges of starting the season shorthanded and whether he feels the on-court chemistry is where it needs to be. Varejao also gave an update on his health heading into the opener and whether he was surprised about his level of activity during the preseason.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:09:17.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
