(CBS12) - The last time Kevin Harvick was in South Florida, he was winning the Sprint Cup.Tuesday he was back to promote the upcoming race at Homestead Miami Speedway.And he was taking his first trip to the Everglades. But not really embracing it at first.. He turned down the photo op with a python, and didn't feel great about one with a gator either. The big bad race car driver, didn't want to touch this little guy.But once he got behind the wheel so to speak.Everything became a lot more comfortable.It may not be the number 4 Budweiser Chevy.. but Harvick started to get the hang of driving an airboat. Even a donut celebration was in order.Yes it can get wild out on the track - but it can get even wilder out on the boat. A lesson the reigning champ learned Tuesday.The Ecoboost 400 - the Sprint Cup finale at Homestead Miami Speedway is November 22nd. Harvick is currently 5th in Sprint Cup points.
