Today's helmets protect the egg shell, keep it from cracking. But we also want to protect the egg yoke from sloshing around, like the brain,” said Marver.\nThere is so much proprietary technology in the helmet, Vicis uses a dazzle camouflage to wrap and hide all the unique features so competitors don't catch on.\nMarver joined a renowned doctor on sports concussions at Seattle Children’s -- and a UW engineering professor -- to launch Vicis.\nTheir motivation: the current focus on football and head injuries.\nMarver says the helmet “is designed differently. It's designed with multiple layers. It's designed to protect from both traumatic head injuries and skull fractures. And it functions differently. It has a novel outer shell material. The novel engineered absorbing layer. It feels different. It sounds different.\"\nVicis will soon move operations from a rented UW lab to its own at South Lake Union.\nThe plan is for the helmet to go on the market in spring 2016 -- and be on the heads of NFL players next season.\nVicis has already used the Seahawks for consultation.", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-09T02:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:11:42.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
