He was referring to PM Narendra Modi's statement at Banka meeting on October 2.\nNitish challenged the PM to stop central package as Modi indicated at Banka in case the JD(U)-RJD-Congress Mahagathbandhan won the state election. The CM reiterated that he has the ability to mobilize resources on his own for the state development.\nTargeting central ministers and BJP president Amit Shah who are pledging development in the state, Nitish said they are not bothered about the farmers' plight as the state is reeling under the shadow of drought.\nThe CM was addressing an election meeting at Jhajha in support of JD(U) candidate Damodar Raut. Dr Ravindra Yadav is the BJP candidate for the seat in Jamui district.\nHe countered the Centre that Bihar was lagging much behind others in the field of development and was at the 27th place after ten years of his rule in the state. He said the state had recorded 2 per cent increase every year during the last ten years adding that no state in the country has been able to achieve such a growth.\n\"Yadi aap samajhte hain ki hamne wigat das warshon mein rajya mein vikas ka kam kiya hai to mujhe vote den aur mere umidwaro ko bahumat se jitaein anyatha aap mujhe kadapi vote nahin dein (If you feel Bihar has developed during my regime, please vote for my candidates, otherwise, don't vote for me),\" he said.\nNitish told people to be alert against the nefarious designs of the BJP during Durga Puja and Muharram festivals. He said some antisocial elements could create bad blood among the communities.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-06T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:25:38.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
