Mostly gnats, but also bees, flies and other flying insects. Throughout the trip I found myself wishing I could breathe normally and talk to my friend without fear of swallowing what seemed like thousands of insects. And, thus, I invented GNAT AWAY.\"\nShe developed the GNAT AWAY to keep insects out of the mouth. The unit does not interfere with normal breathing. The device makes exercising outdoors more comfortable and enjoyable. It eliminates hassles and frustrations. The item is easy to use. Furthermore, the accessory is ideal for use when bicycling or jogging.\nThe original design was submitted to the Pittsburgh office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
