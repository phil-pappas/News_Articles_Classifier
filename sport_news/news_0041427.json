Luck, the first overall pick in the 2012 draft, has 10 interceptions and one fumble against the Pats, who have won the four games by a combined 189-73. Luck has multiple turnovers in three of those games.\nLuck has been an upper-echelon quarterback through three-plus seasons, but the giveaways have prevented him from escalating his reputation.\n“It goes game by game. One game, he can have a couple turnovers. One game, he can have five touchdowns,” Patriots safety Patrick Chung said. “You’ve really got to take it with a grain of salt, not pay attention to the outside stuff, play your game as if he’s going to come in here and try to throw 10 touchdowns. We’ll do our job, do it consistently and see how it all turns out.”\nThe Patriots forced Luck to turn it over more than any opponent, but the mistakes don’t evaporate against other teams. Since 2012, Luck has 50 interceptions in 51 regular-season games, the fifth most in the NFL. He also has 31 fumbles (14 lost), which is tied for the fourth most. And his combination of 81 interceptions and fumbles are the second most in the NFL.\n“Like every game, when we get opportunities, we know we’ve got to take advantage of every opportunity,” said safety Devin McCourty, who intercepted Luck last season. “It’s just guys going out there and making a play on some passes. When that happens, we’ve got to do that again. We don’t know how he is going to play. He is a great quarterback. He is obviously going to make some great plays out there, but when we get an opportunity out there, we’ve got to take advantage of it.”\nSunday night’s game will be a different test with a revamped Patriots secondary, and Luck missed the past two games with an injured shoulder. He threw seven interceptions in his first three games, the second highest output of his career in the season’s opening three weeks.\nWhile Pats cornerbacks Malcolm Butler and Logan Ryan settle into their promotions this year, Luck is trying to settle down after an ugly start. That matchup could be a wash if the two-week respite didn’t cure Luck’s wounded wing.\n“He’s a good player,” Ryan said. “We have to do our job. We have to force turnovers a lot of the time. They don’t give them to you. We’ve got to go out there, create takeaways and it’s something we emphasize and will be important to us to try to help out our offense.”\nThe Patriots have noticed tendencies, too. Last season, all three interceptions occurred because they jumped the receiver’s route, which meant they recognized Luck’s intended target. Darrelle Revis did it twice, tipping one interception to McCourty. Jamie Collins had the third pick.\nLuck also isn’t very economical and will rely too much on his arm. That’s how he finds trouble. The Patriots have been fortuitous by matching his aggressiveness.\n“I know he always wants to finish the play,” Butler said. “No matter if he’s going down, he still wants to throw it. If he’s scrambling out of the pocket and somebody grabs him, he’ll still throw the ball. He never gives up on a play.”\nWhile that gun-slinging mentality yields success, Luck sabotaged his team plenty of times. The Pats are preparing for Luck to play a perfect game, but history suggests that won’t happen.\n“There are opportunities out there every week no matter who it is,” Butler said. “We’ve just got to make the plays when they come. I’m pretty sure he’ll be on his game and making less mistakes. Just go out there, compete and play the best we can.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:46:42.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
