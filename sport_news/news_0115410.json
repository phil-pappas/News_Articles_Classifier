Teddy Kulmala tkulmala@heraldonline.com i Order Reprint of this Story \nA nearly year-long undercover operation in Lancaster County yielded 49 arrests, authorities announced Thursday. Warrants were issued for 20 others in the sting called “Operation Silent Sweep.” \nApproximately two dozen drug agents, investigators, and deputies of the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office fanned out across Lancaster County Thursday morning to serve arrest warrants for drug offenses documented during the course of an investigation dubbed Operation Silent Sweep. Approximately 100 arrest warrants were obtained charging 69 defendants with drug and weapons violations. Forty-nine of the 69 have been taken into custody. \nDuring the operation investigators focused on locations and suspects within the county known for drug possession and distribution. They also acted upon complaints of drug activity made by citizens. Undercover operations were conducted with the assistance of confidential informants. Investigators also focused on offenses involving heroin and prescription medications, which have become more prevalent in recent months. \nDrug charges range from possession to possession with intent to distribute to trafficking. Investigators seized 139.4 grams of cocaine, 15 grams of crack cocaine, 201 grams of marijuana, 183 grams of heroin, and 43.5 grams of methamphetamine. \nTwo meth labs were discovered during the operation. \nInvestigators also seized 488 doses of narcotic prescription medications including Oxycodone, Morphine, Methadone, Xanax, Adderall, and Suboxone. \nEleven firearms, two automobiles, and $13,704 in cash were also seized. \nSeveral of the defendants were arrested prior to Thursday. Some of those arrested Thursday were found to be in possession of illegal drugs and were charged with additional offenses. \nOne defendant arrested Thursday, Antonio Labryant Reid, was found to be in possession of 12 grams of crack cocaine, 48 doses of Xanax, and a stolen pistol, the sheriff’s office said. Additional charges of Trafficking Crack Cocaine, Possession with Intent to Distribute Xanax, Possession of a Firearm during the Commission of a Violent Crime, Possession of a Stolen Pistol, and Resisting Arrest will be made against Reid. \n“Drugs continue to be a problem in America,” Sheriff Barry Faile said in a prepared statement. “Drug use and the drug trade fuel all sorts of other criminal activity. It seems that over time the drugs of choice change. Methamphetamine was popular here until we conducted an investigation that led to State Grand Jury indictments against a large group of methamphetamine manufacturers and users, most of whom were recently convicted. We are now dealing more with the use and abuse of Heroin and prescription medications. Our officers will continue to pursue intelligence and complaints about drug offenses and arrest those who violate our drug laws.” \nAnyone with information about this or any other case or the location of any of those still being sought should call the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office at 803-283-3388 or Crimestoppers at 1-888-CRIME-SC or www.sccrimestoppers.com.
