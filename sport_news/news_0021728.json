Kompany was called up for international duty despite missing City's last five games with a calf injury.\nVincent Kompany Pellegrini had insisted that his influential skipper would not be fit for either of the games against Andorra or Israel but Belgium coach Marc Wilmots fielded him in the latter. The 29-year-old came through 58 minutes of action unscathed but Pellegrini was not happy, even though he accepts Wilmots acted within his rights. Pellegrini said: \"I was not pleased because we sent Vincent with some medical report that he was not able to play but, as the manager of Belgium said, he can do what he wants in the international break. He can use the players and he wanted to use him.\n\"But for me, when you don't send a player to the national squad and you cannot use him for your club, I think the other sense must be the same. If a player didn't play the last three games for his club he cannot play for the national squad. But these are the rules. I think some day clubs will protest about that.\"\nPellegrini insisted this had not led to a problem between him and Kompany, but would not confirm whether the defender would return to his starting line-up for today's Premier League clash against Bournemouth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:58:50.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
