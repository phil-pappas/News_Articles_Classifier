Darius Guillory finished the night with three rushes for 107 yards with scores from 41 and 66 yards. \nThe Bucs' rushed the ball 32 times for 350 yards, while quarterback Austin Sutherland completed two touchdowns passes to Kye Williams and Nick Thomas. \nKountze found the end zone twice in the loss, a 37-yard reception from Grayland Arnold to Dayne Wright and a six-yard run from Keyshawn Adams in the third quarter. \nTURNING POINT: East Chambers needed only four plays on three possessions to score 21 points in the third quarter to turn a 21-7 lead into a 42-7 advantage. Scores came on a 6-yard run from Silcox, 66-yard run from Guillory and a 28-yard pass from Sutherland to Thomas. \nThe Bucs' would add another score, a 43-yard run from Trevor Thomas , for a 28-point third quarter. \n\"The ball bounced our way,\" said head coach Russ Sutherland. \"We had a couple quick turnovers that turned into point and we grabbed the momentum.\" \nMOST-SPECTACULAR PLAY: With quarterback Aaron Sutherland on the sideline after taking a big hit from a Kountze defender late in the second quarter, Dylan Silcox made the most of his only throwing attempt of the night. \nPlaying out of the shotgun on 3rd-and-12, the senior moved the pocket to the right side and found wide receiver Nick Thomas wide open 24 yards down field for a first down. \nBY THE NUMBERS: East Chambers had six players find the end zone during the win and came up with four interceptions against Kountze quarterback Grayland Arnold. Silcox nabbed three of those interceptions with the other coming from Cecillio Lopez . \nThe Bucs' had nine players run the ball with five rushing for over 50 yards. \nHE SAID IT: \"It's great when everyone can get in and we build enough cushion to do that,\" Sutherland said. \"Give Kountze credit, they have good athletes and they will win some district games.\" \nRECORDS: East Chambers 5-0, 2-0. Kountze 0-5, 0-2. \nNEXT UP: East Chambers plays at Warren Friday, Oct. 9. Kountze plays at Hardin Friday, Oct. 9. \nDThompson@BeaumontEnterprise.comTwitter.com/@daveth89", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:35:00.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
