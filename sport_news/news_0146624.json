Some of its members include (from left) Jacob Cherry, 14, of Sonora, Nick Craigholm, 16, of Sonora, Victor Battle, 17, of Crystal Falls, Travis Finney, 20, of Twain Harte, Tim Hollis, 17, of Jamestown, T.J. Walker, 14, of Jamestown, and Kai Ayres, 15, of La Grange. Lacey Peterson / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. They are everywhere. Sonora High School home football games, hanging flags on holidays along Washington Street, directing traffic during the Mother Lode Roundup and Christmas parades in Sonora. They help other community events like the Mother Lode Fair, the Home and Garden Show, homecomings, graduations, Trick or Treat Street, private events, fireworks at Lake Don Pedro, the Bike Rodeo at Wal-Mart, and at preschools and schools when McGruff the Crime Dog visits. They’ve cleaned up cemeteries and adopted families at Christmas. They visit nursing homes during the holidays. They are members of the Sonora Police Explorer program, which will mark 20 years next month. Close to 700 young people — ages 14 through 21 — have gone through the program, and about 30 have gone on to careers in law enforcement and military service, including dispatchers, police officers, border patrol, jail staff, corrections officers, California Highway Patrol officers, and the Secret Service. “We’re a support system for the Police Department. We’re subject to call outs in emergencies,” said Sgt. Glenn Roberts, who started the program. “It’s of huge importance because of our manpower.” “They are a valuable asset to the city,” said Tim Miller, Sonora City administrator. Each Explorer in Post No. 364 annually contributes 600 to 700 hours of community service. They meet twice a month and train all year long in the same things adults training in law enforcement do. Members must comply with strict behavior requirements, and they must follow the same policy manual police officers do, Roberts said. “They represent the Sonora Police Department and all of the officers and the city,” Roberts said. “We hold the kids to a higher standard than their peers.” The bulk of their activities focus on community service and training. The post competes in the annual statewide Explorer Challenge and is one of the best teams in the state, Roberts said. Tuolumne County hosted the 2010 challenge, and the Post, like other years, swept the competition. The Explorers compete in simulations of bus assaults, traffic stops, domestic violence, active shooters, DUI, hostage negotiations, physical agility, hostage rescues, shootings, first aid and CPR, bombs and use of force. “Basically everything police officers do in a day, we train for,” said Victor Battle, 17, of Crystal Falls. Battle is a high school junior and wants to pursue a career in the U.S. Marine Corps as military police. He, like most of his Explorer counterparts, joined the program to get ahead in their future career paths. High school freshman Jacob Cherry, 14, of Sonora, says he enjoys meeting people he wouldn’t have otherwise and helping people in the community. High school senior Tim Hollis, 17, of Jamestown, said he uses his training and knowledge from the Explorer program in everyday life. He says it comes into play from safety, to parking, to just “watching your friends’ backs.” The program instills leadership and initiative, members say. “I find myself helping people,” Battle said. He recently attended a fundraiser for his mom’s work and ended up volunteering to help a stranger change her car tire. Explorer adviser Robbie Roberts, 21, of Soulsbyville, said it helped him sail through the testing and training to become a Sheriff’s Office dispatcher. “I joined because I thought this was a good opportunity to give me discipline and guidance to help me reach my main goal of becoming a U.S. Marine,” said high school sophomore Nick Craigholm, 16, of Sonora. Several members have family members who were either in law enforcement or the military. The post is part of the Boys Scouts Learning for Life program. Members are badged at Sonora City Council meetings. The program is supported solely on fundraising and donations. Sonora Police Department donates money each year to the program as well. All advisers are volunteers, and each adviser donates 25 to 30 hours a month to the program. Area businesses like ASF Weapons Training/Gordon Winningham and WTS Weapons Training School/John Popke donate hundreds of hours to the Explorer program with weapon use, team building, knowledge and facility use, Roberts said. The Sonora Area Foundation has also been a faithful supporter. Roberts started the post in November 1995 and named it Post 364 in honor of his father, who led Roberts’ Boy Scout Troop No. 364. Throughout the years, other advisers have led the program, and Roberts has been leading it again for the past six or seven years. Community support is vital to keeping the program going, because members are not charged for any part — uniforms, fun activities, gear, nothing is paid for by the kids. “I want every kid to have the same opportunity,” Roberts said. When the group goes to competitions or on a field trip once a year, the program picks up the cost for hotels, food, etc. “So everyone has the equal opportunity to succeed in the program,” Roberts said.
