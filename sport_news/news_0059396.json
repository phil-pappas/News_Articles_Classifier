That could be seen as falsification of the accounts.\" \nPlatini has already submitted his candidacy ahead of Monday's deadline, but the former European footballer of the year will not be allowed to enter the presidential race while his suspension remains active. \nA FIFA statement read: \"Domenico Scala, in his capacity as chairman of the FIFA ad-hoc electoral committee, provided information to the executive committee regarding the ongoing process for the FIFA presidential election. \n\"He explained that candidacies for the FIFA presidency that are submitted in due time and form, but which relate to candidates who are subject to a (provisional or definite) ban from taking part in any football-related activity, will not be processed by the ad-hoc electoral committee as long as such ban is valid and in force.\" \nPlatini is awaiting the verdict of the FIFA appeals committee and if the Frenchman's ban is lifted before the February election, FIFA has said it would review his candidacy. \nThe statement continued: \"The chairman also told the executive committee that, should such a ban be lifted or expire before the FIFA presidential election, scheduled for 26 February 2016, the ad-hoc electoral committee would decide, depending on the respective exact point in time, on how to proceed with the candidacy concerned.\" \nThere had also been suggestions the election could be postponed but the executive committee confirmed this would not be the case. \nIn addition to Platini, former FIFA vice-president Prince Ali bin al-Hussein, former Trinidad and Tobago player David Nakhid, and Asian Football Confederation president Sheikh Salman al-Khalifa are expected to stand. \nThe election will decide the successor to Blatter, who has been president since 1998 but announced his decision to stand down in June following the arrest of seven FIFA officials on corruption charges. \nSwiss prosecutors then opened criminal proceedings against Blatter in September for criminal mismanagement and the \"disloyal payment\" to Platini. \nFIFA's reform committee also presented its recommendations on Tuesday to improve the organisation's transparency. \nProposals included presidents being subject to an age limit of 74 and a maximum term of 12 years, with salaries of the president and other senior officials made public. \nIt also recommended the executive committee become the \"FIFA Council\", overseeing \"strategic matters\" but not having executive powers over policy.
