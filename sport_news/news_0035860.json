(Photo: FLORIDA TODAY file) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nOffshore: Seas will gradually drop to a three-foot swell by Saturday, which should let anglers venture out onto the Atlantic. The Gulf Stream seems to provide a good dolphin bite right after a big blow, and this weekend could be it. Debris, Sargassum and current eddies jostled around by the recent storm could be fish-holding magnets. On the flipside, sharks tend to move into the reefs after these storms. Bring extra hooks if you’re targeting grouper and snapper on the bottom. \nSurf: Surfers are reporting a non-stop river of mullet making their way south along the beaches. Jacks, tarpon, snook and sharks are having their fill. They’re running closer to shore at high tide, so try casting diving plugs, spoons and red/white bucktails during these times. \nSebastian Inlet: It may be possible to walk across the finger mullet that have flooded into the inlet this week. Football-sized jacks are the most abundant catch, with redfish, bluefish, mangrove snapper, ladyfish, mackerel and snook biting as well. Anglers are doing best with a simple sliding sinker rig using an egg sinker between ½ and 2 ounces and a 30- to 50-pound test mono or fluorocarbon leader. Anglers fishing at sunrise and sunset are seeing the most action. \nPort Canaveral: Flounder, jacks, snook, redfish and bluefish are feeding heavily on mullet inside the port. Freeline mullet around the rocky jetties for snook or keep them on the bottom for redfish. If the seas allow, look for Spanish mackerel, bluefish and tripletail in the Canaveral Bight, just outside the port and to the north. \nInshore – North: Titusville has been hosting an excellent redfish bite along the eastern shoreline of the IRL south of Parrish Park. Extremely high water levels are allowing fish to venture up tight to mangroves, so look for schools close to shore during the early morning calm. Larger redfish are taking cut mullet steaks pinned to a circle hook and allowed to soak on the deeper grassflats. \nInshore – South: With water levels way above normal, snook are having a fiasco, feeding up under normally shallow, exposed mangrove prop roots. Skip a live finger mullet, weedless jerk bait or Near-Clear DOA Shrimp up under the trees. With all the mullet coming through the inlet, the Melbourne Beach to Sebastian stretch of shoreline has been producing linesiders lately.
