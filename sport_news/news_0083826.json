Everest boys coach Manny Pollak had every reason to be ecstatic with a draw Tuesday night. \nWith the help of seven saves by keeper Alex Pagel, the Evergreens secured the outright Wisconsin Valley Conference championships for first time in school history with a 0-0 tie against Marshfield on Senior Night. \n“Being the first conference (boys soccer) championship in school history, I don’t think the guys understand how much it means to this program right now,” Pollak said. “It might sink in in a couple days. \n“It means a tremendous amount to us,” Pollak added. “Some of these seniors have been with team and played for four years. The seniors gave everything they’ve got and the younger players rallied around them.” \nMarshfield \nSaves: Marshfield (Mathias Holm) 7; D.C. Everest (Alex Pagel) 7. \nRecords: DCE 14-1-2, 9-1-1 WVC; Marshfield 7-3-1 WVC. \nWausau East 2, Wausau West 1 \nWAUSAU — Adam Hahn and Landon Dehnel each knocked in a goal for the Lumberjacks in their win against rival Wausau West in the Wisconsin Valley Conference matchup. \nThe Lumberjacks and Warriors were also playing for the rights to the “Wausau Cup,” which West won on penalty kicks after the rivals split their regular season matches. \nWausau West \n0 \n2-2 \nSecond half: 1. WE, Adam Hahn (Charlie Keefe), 59:21; 2. WW, Steven Lewendowski (Alex Names), 77:53; 3. WE, Landon Dehnel (unassisted), 88:48. \nSaves: Wausau East (Sam Petralia) 4; Wausau West (Thomas Hogan) 9. \nRecord: Wausau East 6-11-1, 2-9 WVC. \nVOLLEYBALL \nMarshfield 3, D.C. Everest 2 \nMARSHFIELD — Ultimately, the Tigers made a few more plays down the stretch and outlasted the Evergreens to pick up a 25-16, 19-25, 24-26, 25-22, 15-10 win in the Wisconsin Valley Conference showdown. \n“It was definitely a hard-fought match between two teams that wanted it badly,” D.C. Everest coach Rita Jasurda said. “Marshfield played very well defensively, and I thought we did a nice job hitting between and around the blocks. \n“It’s a tough loss for us, we would loved to have ended with a win, but we came up a little bit short.” \nJenna Rombalski and Regan Stefan paced the DCE hitting attack with 13 kills apiece, while Caroline Hehir and Natalie Mohring handed out 22 and 19 assists, respectively. \nAlyssa Frahm keyed the defense with 29 digs and Stefan added 18 digs.

We had aggressive serving from Maddix Bonnell, Ali Zamzow and Kelsie Belfiori to help pad us a lead in sets 2 and 3.” \nWisconsin Valley Lutheran 3, Almond-Bancroft 0 \nMOSINEE — Brianna Borski had 10 digs in the Eagles losing effort against the Wolves. \nThe Wolves won 25-21, 25-21, 25-14.
