(AP) - New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan says the state will review a case in which a judge stripped a fired Portsmouth police officer of most of a $2 million inheritance from a woman's disputed will.\nA judge in August dismissed Geraldine Webber's 2012 will and trust, saying that former police Sgt. Aaron Goodwin acted on Webber's \"fears and hopes\" to extract her inheritance, which included a waterfront home, Cadillac, stocks and bonds.\nA social worker with the state Bureau of Elderly and Adult Services said in 2012 that the allegations against Goodwin were unfounded.\nThe Portsmouth Herald reports ( http://bit.ly/1hAM9gb ) that Hassan said Friday she will continue to work with the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services to review the timeline of events in the case.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
