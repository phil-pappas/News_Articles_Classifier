The two struggled to get a rhythm going and looked very timid playing, not taking advantage of some shots. Yachinich and Tollas continued to play solid tennis in order to win the first set. \n“We tried to work on the pressure situations and the nerves at state and we came here and hit earlier in the week and they were already nervous,” said Lake Mills’ head coach Cam Dary. “You could see that was the deciding factor in their matches.” \nAfter falling 6-0 in the first set, and being down 2-1 in the second, Riley got on the serve and started to play the tennis that Dary had expected. The senior hit some hard and accurate serves to put Tollas and Yachinich on their heels. \n“We went out and told them later on that it’s just time to let it all go and play with some reckless abandon and leave everything on the court and she did,” Dary said. “She just started being aggressive and it really worked and it got them some points, but they dug themselves in a hole and its tough to come back at this point in the season.” \nUnfortunately for Riley and Oemig, that was the only success the duo had in the match, eventually falling 6-0, 6-2. \nThe two finish their   doubles record of 3-4.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:07:48.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
