It upset her but she couldn't keep away from the screen. \n\"Now she's been reading the Sunderland fans' sites and she tells me the reaction has been very positive, which makes me very excited to get going. \n\"Everyone wants to be praised and to feel wanted and I just hope I can give the Sunderland supporters some of the excitement they are looking for. \n\"It's nice to be loved, but at West Ham and Newcastle I was faced by passionate fans that made themselves heard if they weren't happy. \n\"It wasn't just me at West Ham, it was every manager that was there. I got it because I was manager at that time, but before that they moaned about Avram Grant, Alan Curbishley, Alan Pardew and Harry Redknapp.\" \nPardew more recently struggled to win over Newcastle's fans and eventually left for Crystal Palace, where he has overseen the club's rise to an early-season top-four place. \n\"Look at how Alan Pardew's career has transformed,\" Allardyce said. \"They gave him a hard time at Newcastle and he moved to Palace, where the fans love him. The turnaround has been scary.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T13:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:47:51.882+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
