A tough loss granted. To make it worse I had to follow the game on my computer. UGH! Anyways, I don't think it changes a lot in the big-scheme of things. If we're as good as we think we are...and I believe we are...the Green Bay game at \"home\" late in the season will decide \"home\"-field advantage for the play-offs. ...and while disappointed with the loss, the NFL \"talking heads\" didn't immediately jump on the \"same ol' Cardinals\" bandwagon or make snide comments about us. We'll be OKAY! That being said...DON'T expect any \"calls\" to go our way in Pitt. NO ONE gets \"calls\" there. We could be 4-1 but 3-2 wouldn't shock me IF the \"zebras\" get involved. Mark At the end of the day we're 3-1 and as a Cards' fan since 67' I can definitely live with that. ...And, finally, we get some sunshine here tomorrow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:30:46.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
