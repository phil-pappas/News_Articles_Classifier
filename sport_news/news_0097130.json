It’s a popular and interesting question for many reasons, including that the Seahawks have the NFL’s 11th-ranked scoring defense and are fourth in yards allowed. That’s not up to their recent tradition, but it’s also not indicative of a defense in crisis. And yet it’s true the Seahawks are searching for answers, particularly from their damaging fourth-quarter collapses this season. “We’re right where we have been,” linebacker K.J. Wright said, “but not for long enough. We’re not doing it long enough.” Here are three reasons the defense this year is different from those from the previous two years: Losing the war of attrition Of all the characteristics that have defined the Seahawks’ defense, the one thing that became its calling card was its ability to force teams into long, trudging drives. It’s a part of coach Pete Carroll’s philosophy and has played out in devastating fashion: Teams might move the ball, chewing up yards, but it will take nine or 10 plays. The effect could be demoralizing, and any glitch along the way tilted the odds in the Seahawks’ favor. Former Seahawks defensive coach Marquand Manuel summed up the Seahawks’ ideology perfectly at the Super Bowl last season: “You can look at it: 12-, 13-, 14-play drives. Methodically. Sometimes you have the patience. We’ll see. That’s really what it comes down to: Can you do it? Cause guess what? We’re going to be patient.” But the Seahawks aren’t winning that tactical game of chicken as frequently. Just consider the results of drives that lasted at least eight plays over the past three seasons: 2013: Opponents scored touchdowns 27 percent of the time and didn’t score 32 percent of the time. 2014: Opponents scored touchdowns 30 percent of the time and didn’t score 30 percent of the time. 2015: Opponents have scored touchdowns 56 percent of the time and haven’t scored 25 percent of the time. Even more striking, on Sunday the Carolina Panthers scored all four of their touchdowns on drives that lasted at least eight plays. It was just last year, at the end of the season, that defensive tackle Tony McDaniel said teams might beat the Seahawks once on a long drive, “But it’s definitely not going to happen multiple times.” Said Wright, “It’s easier said than done. But that’s something we hang our hat on.” They are allowing explosive pass plays No team in the previous two years gave up fewer pass plays of at least 20 yards than the Seahawks. There is no bigger sin for a defensive back — or linebacker, for that matter — than giving up a big play. It goes back to the Seahawks’ desire to bog teams down. But the Seahawks have allowed 23 pass plays of at least 20 yards this season, which ranks 26th in the league. They gave up 32 pass plays of 20 yards last season and 30 such plays in 2013. They are on pace for more than 60 this year. “We’re not being ourselves,” safety Earl Thomas said. “I think we’re distracted in some areas.” They aren’t overwhelming teams When the Seahawks are at their best, it feels like a party on the field. They’re dancing, they’re swarming the ball-carrier, and they shake offenses into some form of retreat. How many times have we seen a game cruise along, only to have an offense unravel in a hurry? The way that’s commonly happened in the previous few years is by interceptions, but not this year. The Seahawks have just three interceptions after having 18 last year (18th in the league) and 28 the year before (first in the league). Cornerback Richard Sherman, a master of passing thievery, has no interceptions, although some of that is dictated by opportunities. “We’re not getting the turnovers we need right now,” Avril said. “That’s coming from sack fumbles or interceptions or whatever. We’re not getting those. We need to get back to those more than anything.” “I’m not sure what’s the reasoning. But we better figure it out soon if we want this thing to change around.” More like this story", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:53:35.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
