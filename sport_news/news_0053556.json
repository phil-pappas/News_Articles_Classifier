The players don't know,\" Mourinho said. \nMourinho has left forward Pedro and striker Loic Remy behind due to minor injuries, increasing the likelihood Hazard will return to the starting XI. \nAsked about Hazard's response to his comments, Mourinho said: \"How did he train? He trained like Eden.\" \nMourinho also says Radamel Falcao has given no indication to him of his apparent desire to leave Chelsea following reports. \n\"To me he said absolutely nothing in relation to that,\" Mourinho said. \nChelsea's season has lurched from one 'crisis' to the next, but Mourinho maintains they will finish in the top four of the Premier League, thus qualifying for the Champions League, and could even win all four available trophies this term. \n\"My opinion is that we are not going to miss Champions League,\" Mourinho said. \n\"We are in October. Everything is open. We can win all four, (but) we can lose all four. In this country it's very difficult.\" \nMourinho is also challenging a Â£50,000 fine and suspended one-match stadium ban, the written reasons for which were published on Monday \nA Football Association independent regulatory commission said Mourinho was handed a suspended one-match stadium ban as fines were not a strong enough deterrent for his criticism of officials. \nThe Blues boss was sanctioned for saying referee Robert Madeley had been \"afraid\" to award a penalty in Chelsea's 3-1 loss to Southampton on October 3. \nMourinho also said: \"Be honest with us and give what you have to give, and it's a big penalty.\" \nReferring to previous infractions by Mourinho, the written reasons said: \"It appears to us that increasing levels of fine are not on their own going to be a reliable deterrent for Mr Mourinho against improper comments to the media. \n\"In our judgment the fair way to impose this deterrent is to suspend the ban so that Mr Mourinho is able quite easily to avoid its ever coming into effect. The matter is in his hands. \n\"All he has to do is refrain from any further breach by media comments for the next 12 months, whereupon the ban will expire completely.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T10:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:14:10.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
