Montgomery also won a state title for the first time since 2002 with a 3-2 win over Ridge in the Group IV final. \nMillburn will face second-seeded Holmdel in the T of C final today. \n“I expected a dog fight, I told the girls my expectation was not to come out with a win but for them to believe that they could. I think across the board they really kind of played that way, showed a lot of heart,” Montgomery coach Raheel Saleem said. “They’re a little disappointed obviously, but I think seeing the way they’re bonding right now it’s more about what a great season it’s been, and how much they’ve accomplished. I reiterated that the whole season, I want you to believe that we can and I think they really showed how far they can come.” \nAt second singles, Shannon Lu won the first set 6-2 and started the second set down 5-0 to Millburn’s Alexandra Pritsker. Lu then rallied back to tie 5-5 before falling 7-5, then lost 10-8 in the third set tie breaker. \n“Honestly I was just trying to hit the ball as well as I could, we had played them before in the invitational tournament and I lost 3-6, 3-6, but I wasn’t playing my best and this time I just wanted to do better than how I did last time,” Lu said. “I wasn’t expecting to get the first set and coming from 5-0, I was surprised. At that time I thought, maybe I can actually do this. I think towards the end she started playing more aggressively and that’s how she won.” \nMontgomery’s second doubles team of Annie Yang and Isabelle Kreydin were tied 5-5 in the first set, but fell 7-5, then lost the second set 6-0. \nAmy and Allie Yan lost at first doubles 6-3, 6-0. At first singles Lily Chu fell to Millburn’s Stephanie Schrage 6-0, 6-0 and Emily Roeper lost to Joanna Atwater 6-2, 6-3 at third singles. \nThe Cougars, which entered the season with a new coach and a different look, as Montgomery lost three seniors and Roeper moved from first doubles to third singles, didn’t quite know how far they could go. \n“I think I tried to keep my expectations down, I didn’t want to come in being a first time coach and putting it on them, saying we’re going to win, but really I wanted to come out and make sure these girls knew that this game is fun and really competing at a high of level as possible,” Saleem said. “When I started the first day, there were some growing pains for me obviously, new coach and the girls not knowing me really, but we’ve all kind of come together as a team and we talk about it all the time how each win has been as a team, from the coaches down to even the reserve players, we all work together, it’s been awesome.” \nMontgomery started the season 3-0 and after a 3-2 loss to Ridge on Sept. 24, rolled off 10 straight wins, including a 3-2 sectional final win over J.P. Stevens and its state title run. \n“I am so proud of my team, going into the season we didn’t expect to be able to come this far and now looking back, I’m just really proud of them,” Lu said. “I’m really happy that it was this group because it’s my senior year and a lot of these girls are seniors, even if they weren’t on varsity, we’re more of a family then we were in year’s past and I’m really glad that it was this group.” \nStaff Writer Lauren Knego: lknego@gannettnj.com 1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1LJ7oZp TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:43:16.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
