Atletico has three points, while Turkey's Galatasaray and Astana, which drew 2-2 in Kazakhstan earlier Wednesday, have one point each. \nAtletico hosts Astana in the next round, while Benfica plays at Galatasaray. \nBenfica, the two-time defending champion in Portugal, is trying to advance to the round of 16 only for the second time in its last eight Champions League campaigns. \nAtletico Madrid, the 2014 runner-up in the European tournament, dominated much of the match and created most of the scoring opportunities, missing chance-after-chance while Benfica efficiently took advantage of its few prospects. \nBrazilian World Cup veteran goalkeeper Julio Cesar made several difficult saves to help his team come away from Madrid with the three points. \nBenfica hadn't scored in three consecutive away matches this season. \nIt was the third loss of the season for Atletico in eight matches, and the second at home. The other was a 2-1 setback against Barcelona in the Spanish league, when it also scored first and relinquished the lead. Atletico Madrid's other loss was to Spanish league leader Villarreal last weekend. \nAtletico had won 21 of the last 24 games, including all three in the group stage of last year last year's Champions League, outscoring opponents 10-0. \nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:51:59.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
