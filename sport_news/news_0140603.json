By definition, he rarely shares any valuable information with the fans or media. Unless your name is Rex Ryan, this is how you're expected to act when you get a head coaching job. Getting intel from Jim Schwartz was nearly impossible. Caldwell is much more affable than Schwartz, but his level of privacy is just as high. Caldwell won't tell you anything, but at least he'll do it with a smile on his face.\nThe theme of the week for the Lions was Matthew Stafford and Calvin Johnson. In Sunday's 37-34 overtime win over the Bears, Stafford connected with Johnson six times for a season-high 166 yards and a touchdown. The offensive line protected Stafford, giving him enough time to target Johnson deep down the field. And for roughly the 43rd time in his career, Johnson proved to the skeptics that he remains a viable threat in the NFL.\nCaldwell was asked a number of ways this week whether or not Sunday's performance showed him that the Lions need to throw deep to Johnson a couple of times every game in order to soften up the secondary, open up the running game and basically take a shot with your most dangerous weapon. Caldwell wouldn't answer specifically of course. His standard answer was something along the lines of, \"every game is different.\" If the Lions see some matchup that favors the deep passing game, they'll look to exploit it. But if Johnson is bracketed and has no room to maneuver, they'll look to attack the Vikings defense in other ways.\nThis may all be a smoke screen. There's a chance that Caldwell and offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi know that they have to take a few shots down the field and plan on doing so in every game from here forward. It's not as if Caldwell is going to announce that publicly. There's also the chance that Caldwell and Lombardi stubbornly believe that the underneath game and the short passing game will work with Stafford as quarterback and they only need to throw deep as needed. All we can do is to go off what we've seen through six games this season. What we've seen is not enough Calvin Johnson.\nWhen Caldwell hired Lombardi, the pick seemed inspired. Lombardi came from New Orleans, where the Saints had a potent offense with a veteran quarterback and multiple weapons at all positions. The Lions had Johnson, Golden Tate, Reggie Bush, Brandon Pettigrew, Joe Fauria, Eric Ebron, Jeremy Ross and others. If Drew Brees could effectively use multiple pass catchers, why couldn't Stafford? That question was answered quickly. Brees is one of the most accurate passers we've ever seen. Stafford, in a word, isn't. The Saints also never had a player like Johnson. If you've ever played fantasy football and owned a Saints receiver, you know what a mirage they could be. Back in their contending years, you could have Marques Colston catch three touchdowns one week and have one reception the next. The same was true for Devery Henderson, Robert Meachem, Lance Moore. You name it. Other than Jimmy Graham's big years, there was no one offensive star that made the offense move. Brees was that star.\nStafford doesn't have that same consistency to sustain an offense over 60 minutes. He remains a big-armed gunslinger who needs to complete a few chunk passes each game for the offense to survive. His yards per attempt has dropped in each of Lombardi's two seasons from where it was when he arrived. In 2013, Stafford averaged 7.3 yards per attempt. Last season, it was 7.1. So far this season, it's down to 6.8. There are other factors at play there besides their inability to target Johnson down field. The struggles of the offensive line, the lack of a running game and the injuries at tight end just to name a few. But all those things seem to work a little bit better if the opposing defense is always on guard for Johnson breaking free in the secondary.\nStafford was vocal and emotional before and after the game on Sunday. He downplayed his role, but other teammates noted that he spoke to the team before the game and was lauded by Caldwell in the locker room afterwards. We'll never know what went into that speech or what went into that performance. But after getting benched against the Cardinals, it's logical to conclude that Stafford spoke freely with Caldwell and Lombardi on ways to improve the offense. As a result, Lombardi moved up to the press box, QB coach Jim Bob Cooter moved down to the field, the offensive line played it's best game yet and Johnson was a deep threat once again.\nWho knows how much Stafford had to do with any of that. But he's at his best when Johnson is at his best. And Johnson is at his best when he's challenging defensive backs deep down the field with his size, strength and speed. The best result of such a play is a big gain. The worst result is a turnover with at least the distance of an average Sam Martin punt. The lingering results are the knowledge and the fear that Johnson could go deep again. And again. And again.\nThe Lions are not the Saints. We know this by now. This Sunday, they go up against a Vikings defense which has not allowed many big plays during the season (they've allowed just 13 pass plays of twenty yards or more). The bread and butter of the offensive game plan might be underneath passes to Tate and Theo Riddick and let them pick up yards after the catch. But as long as they believe Johnson is still a threat (which he is). And as long as they believe Stafford is still the answer at quarterback (which they do... I think), then it's pure folly not to let the two of them play to their greatest strength a few times a game. I'm sure they'd dismiss this as simplistic and say that you can't just go deep unless the match-up allows it.\nI'd respond to that in two ways. First, don't take what the defense gives you, create something that the defense is forced to respond to. Second, do you think Vikings coach Mike Zimmer and defensive coordinator George Edwards fear Johnson catching passes underneath or catching passes deep down the field? It's time to make the opposing team feel a little uncomfortable. Unleashing Stafford and Johnson together is the best way for the Lions offense to do that.", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/jamiesamuelsen/"], "published": "2015-10-24T10:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:05:03.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
