The MACT has directed that the compensation amount be paid by truck driver Kuldeep Singh, owner of the truck MoH (UT) and New India Assurance Company. The victim remained bed ridden for six months after the mishap and suffered permanent physical disability to the extent of 10 per cent in his left leg as a result of the mishap. As per the petition filed before the tribunal through advocate Navdeep Arora on May 13, 2014, 37-year-old Pardeep Dubey, a resident of Dariya village stated that he was going from Sector 28-A, Chandigarh, to his house situated in Dariya village on his motorcycle. When he reached the Sukhna light point at the Industrial Area Phase I Chandigarh, a truck bearing registration number CH-01-G-1063 came from the rear at a fast speed and hit against his motorcycle. Due to the impact, he fell down on the road and was dragged by the truck to a distance. Pardeep sustained serious injuries and he was rushed to the PGI, Chandigarh. The petitioner sought compensation on account of multiple grievous injuries sustained by him. An FIR of rash and negligent driving was also registered against the truck driver Kuldeep Singh. “From the medical/treatment record, it is apparent that the petitioner had remained under treatment for about one year, during which he must have suffered pain and agony. Due to the injuries, the petitioner must have suffered loss of amenities in life and he has to go through the same ordeal in future as well,” said the tribunal. “The victim remained bed ridden for a period of six months, due to the injuries suffered by him in the accident in question, during which he certainly suffered loss of income. By a fair estimate, he could not pursue his vocation for six months. As per the medical certificate he was physically disabled to the extent of 10 per cent qua left lower limb. Due to this disability, which is functional, there is limitation of movement of ankle joint of the petitioner. The petitioner, being a male member has to earn to support his family and this disability will certainly create problems in performing the same. The functional disability of injured-petitioner will also affect his job. Certainly, the earning capacity of the petitioner has been lowered. In the present case, the injured petitioner is treated to be a labour, he will certainly face hardship to perform his duties due to the disability suffered by him, in earning his livelihood,” said the tribunal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:23:37.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
