(AP) - A Civil War statue placed in a famous Rochester cemetery more than a century ago is being restored.\nThe Democrat and Chronicle of Rochester reports ( http://on.rocne.ws/1Mzh2hO ) that architectural conservators are working this week on the monument in Mount Hope Cemetery.\nThe bronze sculpture was created by Sally James Farnham, a native of Ogdensburg in northern New York. It depicts a flag-bearing soldier standing next to a bugler. Erected in 1908, it stands in a section of the cemetery holding the graves of hundreds of Civil War veterans.\nThe conservators hope to return the sculpture to its original appearance by removing the coat of paint that had been applied to the statue sometime after its creation.\nSuffragist Susan B. Anthony and abolitionist Frederick Douglass are among the historic figures buried in the cemetery.\nInformation from: Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, http://www.democratandchronicle.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://on.rocne.ws/1Mzh2hO"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:57:35.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
