They also happen to be the best of friends. \n\"We're great friends off the court,\" King said. \"I think it's helpful on the court, because we like to look for each other and we like to feed off each other's energy.\" \n\"I think if we're playing well, then the other people will follow,\" Reyes said. \nBoth buddies were dominant at the net Wednesday afternoon, as the Blue Eagles rolled past Glen Rock, 25-11, 25-14, in an independent match. \nReyes had nine kills in the first game and King had five in the second game as the Blue Eagles (21-5) barely broke a sweat while winning in under an hour. \nThe IHA team that lost to Old Tappan last week did not make an appearance Wednesday. This group was all business from the start, especially at the net. \n\"When we play well up front, it gives us all energy and momentum,\" said Reyes, who scored four straight points at the net in the first game to give the Blue Eagles a comfortable lead. \"Honestly, I just hit the ball where I'm supposed to. But any time you put your team in the lead, it's a good feeling.\" \nKing thought it was important for the Blue Eagles to gain control of both games early on. \n\"I think our team feels more comfortable playing with the lead,\" King said. \"I think we just tend to play better.\" \nGlen Rock (15-4) tried to make it at least close in the second game, but King hit a blast at the net, then had a service ace that pushed the lead to 18-11, and the Blue Eagles just coasted from there. \nSenior Caitlyn Floyd paced the IHA attack with 17 assists. King added four digs for the winners, as did sophomore Julia Morris. \nIHA coach Maria Nolan was pleased with the way King and Reyes performed at the net. \n\"We can attack the net at different times,\" Nolan said. \"We have a lot of players who can do that. … I thought Casey and Annabel played well.\" \nPanthers coach Matt Kingsley thought his team played well. \n\"We just wanted to come in here, play our game and play hard,\" Kingsley said. \"I thought we did the things that we're capable of doing and didn't try to do too much.\" \nKingsley said that he had no problem tackling the state's four-time defending overall champion.
