Just one day prior Team USA edged out a strong Colombian team to take the team title in fullpower (squat, benchpress, deadlift), and on Sunday the Americans took home team trophies in the benchpress-only and push/pull (bench/deadlift) categories. \nLed by a contingent of northeast Georgia-based lifters, Team USA also posted a number of world records along the way. Two teams headquartered in Gainesville’s Iron Beast gym -- the Georgia IronDawgs and the 1% Krew -- sent lifters to this year’s GPA meet and many came away with records and world championships. \nIronDawg Trey Hague of Augusta won world championships in three categories: Men’s Open 90 kilogram (kg)/198.41 pounds weight class, push/pull as well as bench-only and deadlift-only with his bench press of 165/363.76; deadlift of 220/485.01 and total of 848.77. Hague’s benchpress was also good enough for \"best lifter\" in the bench-only category. \nOakwood’s R. Garry Glenn was named bench press team captain by meet director L.B. Baker and competed in both bench-only and push/pull. Lifting at a bodyweight of just over 205 pounds in the l00 kg/220.46 pound class, Glenn established push/pull division world records across the board in bench press (148/326.28); deadlift (181.5/400.13) and total (329.5/726.42). He attempted to bump the world push/pull and national bench-only records to 153/337.3) on a fourth lift, but could not lock it out. Glenn has lifted with both the IronDawgs and the Krew. It was his ninth world bench-only title in various associations, but his first in push/pull. He is an alumnus of Jefferson High where he lettered in football and wrestling and served as a junior high wrestling and football coach. He is also a former Johnson High head wrestling and assistant football coach. \n“I was honored to be chosen as Team Captain for the Bench squad,” Glenn said. “It was a privilege to lift with these men and women on that team and on push/pull. It was great to see some of my friends and acquaintances from other states and around the world. The camaraderie in this sport is second to none. I personally had a good day. Sorry to miss the last bench, but I told the good Lord if he’d let me get over 400 pounds in the deadlift, I wouldn’t tempt him with a fourth lift there. Look at our records and compare them with other associations. What you see continues to prove what I have been saying for years. Some of the strongest people in the world live right around here.” \nOther IronDawgs that lifted in the bench-only category included the husband/wife tandem of Russ and Dana Tripp of Lawrenceville. Russ won the title in the master’s men’s 45-49 age, 75 kg/165.35 pound class with his lift of 145/319.67; while Dana won her master’s women’s 40-44-year-old 52 kg/114.64 pound division with her press of 47.5/104.72. Flowery Branch’s Zack Layfield took the title in the Master’s Men’s 70-74, 75kg class with a lift of 85/187.39. Layfield attempted to break his won world record of 89 kg/196.21 pounds, but a heavy mis-load on his fourth attempt left him to try to break the record on a fifth try and the attempt was unsuccessful. IronDawg Joey Murphy of Mt. Airy took the title and the world record in the master’s men’s 45-49 110 kg/242.51 pounds with his benchpress of 193/425.49, breaking Tim Moon’s old record. \nWinterville’s Andy Williamson of the IronDawgs won the push/pull master's men's 50-54 110kg with his world record total of 382.5/843.26, breaking his own world marks in deadlift (232.5/512.57) and total along the way. He bumped the push/pull deadlift mark to 235/518.08 on a fourth lift, which is not figured into the regular meet totals. \nMarcell Allen of Gainesville, a co-owner of the Iron Beast Gym and the founder of the 1% Krew, won the world championship in the open 110kg push/pull with his total of 464/1,022.93. \nOther Best Lifter Awards went to a pair of Slovenian lifters. In the women’s 56 kg/123.46 pounds open class, Marisa Golob broke her own push/pull world marks with a bench of 95/209.44; deadlift of 160/352.74 and total of 255/562.17. She equaled the world bench-only record of 97.5/214.95 on a fourth lift. Her efforts let her take home Best Lifter Awards in all three categories. Training partner Erni Gregoric took \"best lifter\" in deadlift and push/pull. Lifting in the men’s sub-master (35-39 years old) 7kg category, Gregoric pulled 235/518.08 and totaled 377.5/832.24, breaking his own world records in deadlift and total along the way. He also bumped the push/pull deadlift world mark to 240/529.1 on a fourth lift. The \"best lifter\" without knee wraps award went to Florida's Steve Kylis who totaled 542.5/1,196 in taking the master's men's 60-64, 90kg class in world record fashion. \nComplete results will be posted on the Global Powerlifting website globalpowerliftingalliance.com.
