(For OzarksSportsZone.com) -- Norwood got out to a quick 6-0 lead over Dora in the district championship on Thursday, but the Lady Pirates would end up needing some final inning heroics to secure the title. Dora chipped away at their opponent’s early lead to take the advantage late in the game, scoring five runs in the sixth and two more in the seventh. Down 11-8, the Lady Pirates stepped up to the plate and knocked in four clutch runs in the bottom of the seventh to take home the district title.“This is what we’ve been working for all season,” said Norwood pitcher Emily Chadwell. “We’ve prepared for it every day. We’ve had our ups and downs through it. We came through even when we didn’t think we could, and we came out strong and were ready to play. We played for our senior, Cherokee McGraw, for sure.” CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS OF THE GAME Lady Pirates head coach Philip Reed said this is their first district title win since 2010, and the team won their conference as well. “They work hard together and gel well together,” he said, “and I think that’s what makes a great team.” The game opened with a quiet first inning, as an anxious crowd looked on. In the second, Norwood’s Emma McIntosh started things off with a single, and the Lady Pirates loaded the bases. McIntosh was batted in after two runners walked, and Chloe Crain followed with a triple to score three runners: Emma Nelson, Melody Campbell, and Megan Campbell. Crain and Emily Chadwell added two more runs to go up 6-0 over Dora. Tommi Gardner batted in Ashlynn Vanatter before scoring Dora’s second run in the third. Dora’s strong defense in the bottom of the inning held off a Norwood attack. Dora executed two sacrifice bunts in the top of the fourth, one of them a well-timed squeeze play to score Keeli Land. The Lady Falcons scored again in the fifth thanks to a Makenzie Smith single and a Keeli Land double and RBI to move up 4-6. The Lady Pirates answered with back-to-back doubles from Jenna Ogletree and Emma McIntosh to make it 7-4, before Land struck out the next two batters. Hailey Jones picked up a double for Dora to open the sixth inning. Vanatter was back on base after being hit by a pitch, and a Colvin hit scored the two runners to trail Norwood by two. Tommi Gardner scored Colvin, 6-7, and followed it with a steal at third. Keeli Land smacked a double to score Gardner and Makenzie Smith and gave the Lady Falcons their first lead of the game, 8-7. Land then advanced to third thanks to a passed ball at home, and Makenzie Gardner knocked her home on a double, 9-7. Ogletree reached on an error by the first baseman, and McIntosh doubled to bring in Ogletree. Norwood trailed 8-9 at the close of the sixth. Kryslyn Colvin did not disappoint in her at-bat, slugging a big home run to score herself and Vanatter and to advance Dora’s lead, 11-8. Norwood was up to the plate in their final chance to win the contest. The bases were loaded when Melody Campbell picked up a double to score Cherokee McGraw and Emma McIntosh and make it 11-10. Megan Campbell stepped up to bat with the weight of the game on her shoulders. “I prayed the whole time and God helped me through it,” she said. “I was thinking, ‘I’ve got to do this or we could lose.’” Campbell’s resulting hit scored her sister and Emma Nelson and clinched the district title for the Lady Pirates.“I think we were focused coming in,” said Coach Reed. “In the second inning we put up six runs, which I think got us a big boost. We’ve kind of played in some tough games like that all year. I truly believe for the first time all year that we’ve fought back in the last inning and won a game, and it couldn’t have been at a better time.” Dora head coach Dylan Fox said, “We are pretty young, and nerves got to us pretty bad in the second. Then we just picked away and picked away, and they get a couple of runs here and there, and pitching and defense got a lot better. But I think youth took back over in the last inning, and Norwood is a good team. It was a good game and a good season, and that’s all I can ask for.” Coach Fox credited many of his players for a solid performance. “Kryslyn Colvin played a really good game at short and had a big home run in the last inning that I thought was going to seal it. Mackenzie Gardner had a good game over at third and had a couple of hits. We had a lot of freshmen step up. Keeli threw well, even though she had a couple of rough innings, but definitely this will make us a lot better.” Coach Reed, who has previously credited his team’s ability to hit 1 through 9 for part of their success, said the game-winning hit came by the eight-hole hitter, Megan Campbell, who is a freshman. “All the girls at certain points in this year have struggled, but the special thing about this team and why we win big games is because at any one point, 1-9, somebody steps up and wins the game for us, and that happened tonight.”“Obviously we get great pitching performance, which keeps us in the game, but tonight it took a team effort to score 12 runs and win a district. They are a great group of kids and they believe in each other. I was proud of them,” said Reed. The Norwood Lady Pirates will advance to sectional play.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T09:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:54:24.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
