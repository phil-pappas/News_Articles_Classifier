Here are some players to keep an eye on in Week 6:\nStart 'em\nGolden Tate, WR, Detroit Lions : Tate has not found the end zone yet this season, but Detroit's hapless offense is much to blame for that. He did see a season high in both targets and receptions last week against Arizona, and gets ready to face a Chicago Bears defense this week that has given up eight touchdown receptions to wide receivers. Tate should get plenty of targets again, and might be looking at his best opportunity yet this season to find pay dirt.\nJohn Brown, WR, Arizona Cardinals : Larry Fitzgerald still commands the lion's share of targets for Arizona, but John Brown has certainly made the most of his secondary receiver role. He caught all four passes thrown his way in Week 5 versus Detroit, including one for a touchdown and another for a 49-yard gain. The Pittsburgh Steelers have holes in their secondary that Brown can exploit in one-on-one coverage, which he figures to see a lot, as Fitzgerald draws more defensive attention.\nLamar Miller, RB, Miami Dolphins : Miller has been underwhelming and woefully underused in Joe Philbin's offense this year, averaging just 3.5 yards per carry on nine carries per game, with no touchdowns. Now that Philbin is out in Miami, new head coach Dan Campbell should refocus the offense around the run. The Dolphins are coming off a bye and will be fresh against a middling Tennessee Titans defense.\nSit 'em\nJimmy Graham, TE, Seattle Seahawks : Seattle just has not figured out a way to maximize Graham's usage this season. He has only two touchdowns on the year, and averages around four catches for 40 yards per game. Tight ends often serve as a quarterback's safety net, but Russell Wilson's ability to extend plays with his legs (combined with Seattle's array of offensive weapons) has somewhat negated Graham's effectiveness. A game against Carolina in Week 6 will not help, as the Panthers are good at shutting down tight ends, and are plenty familiar with Graham from his time in New Orleans.\nPierre Garcon, WR, Washington : Garcon became the prime target for Washington after DeSean Jackson and Jordan Reed went down with injuries, but he has yet to produce a break out performance in his featured role. Meanwhile, Jamison Crowder has turned into Kirk Cousins' go-to guy the last few weeks, catching eight more passes than Garcon over the last three games. Washington has some glaring offensive problems that don't figure to get easier in Week 6, when they face off against the dominant New York Jets defense. Garcon will likely match up against cornerback Darrelle Revis in that game, one of the best lock down corners in the league.\nTravis Benjamin, WR, Cleveland Browns : Cleveland's top wide receiver has been a treat for fantasy owners this season. He leads the team in targets, touchdowns and total yards, but a date with the Denver Broncos in Week 6 in daunting. Denver has allowed the fewest fantasy points to wide receivers this season, thanks to the shut down tandem of Aqib Talib and Chris Harris, Jr at cornerback. Denver has handcuffed nearly every top wide receiver they have faced this season, and that does not seem likely to change this week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:15:48.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
