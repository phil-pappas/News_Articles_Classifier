Racing Coverage \nTALLADEGA, ALA. | Dale Earnhardt Jr. has six victories at the Talladega Superspeedway, including the most recent race there in May. \nJeff Gordon also has six wins at the massive 2.66-mile oval. \nBut that provides little comfort to either for Sunday’s CampingWorld.com 500. \nMulti-car crashes are expected since traffic often bunches up in three-wide, 10-deep packs. As a cutoff race in the Chase for the Championship, the pressure is magnified for 11 drivers, including Earnhardt and Gordon, to avoid the mayhem. \n“Yeah, it’s real intense,” Earnhardt said. “There’s no denying the intensity and the pressure it puts on drivers like myself to be in a cutoff situation where you’re eliminated if things don’t go perfectly on Sunday. But I think it’s what the fans enjoy. If I’m a fan, I like it.” \nGordon will have the small comfort of starting the race from the pole. He turned a lap of 194.500 mph Saturday afternoon to at least go into the first turn with all possible trouble trailing. \nHe also knows it all could change by the time he’s in Turn 2. \nKasey Kahne will start second, followed by Jimmie Johnson in third, Matt Kenseth and Earnhardt. \nAll three of Gordon’s poles this year came at restrictor-plate tracks. His finishes in the two previous pole starts were 33rd at the Daytona 500 and 31st at Talladega. Both times he was on the lead lap. \nFour Chase drivers will be eliminated from the playoffs following the race and eight will advance to the third round. Joey Logano is the only driver who is guaranteed to advance. The other 11 will have to rely on their results in Sunday’s race . \nTalladega always has been treacherous since cars are underpowered and can’t break away from the pack. NASCAR mandates the use of restrictor plates at Talladega and the Daytona International Speedway to reduce speeds for safety reasons. \nIn reality, restrictor plates have dramatically increased the chances of a multi-car crash. \nAnd the Chase only makes it worse. \n“The only difference is the drama and storylines — what’s at stake, who’s on the outside looking in,” Gordon said. “No one is safe other than Joey. \n“In this type of racing, you have to accept it. You can’t fight against it; it is what it is.” \nSince every position affects the standings, drivers must be willing to take greater risks to get up front. And once they’re there, they have to be equally aggressive to stay there. \nEven with traffic running inches apart at 200 mph, many are more than willing to use their front bumper to push their way to the front. Others aren’t afraid to use their back bumpers as a road block. \nThe results often sweep a lot of innocent victims into a massive pileup. \n“I think you’re looking at this weekend and there are certainly going to be some people that race scared and racing scared, to me, means sometimes you race not to win, but to not lose as far as the points are concerned,” Brad Keselowski said. \n“The tactics certainly change when the circumstances around them change, and the Chase is certainly a change from a normal race weekend. \n“My first real thought is, ‘Don’t wreck.’ And if we can get through this race without wrecking, we’ll have a really good day.” \nLogano won a week ago at Kansas when he knocked Matt Kenseth out of the lead with a bump-and-run pass. Afterward, he offered no apologies for sending Kenseth into a spin since the victory solidified his spot in the third round — and kept Kenseth from advancing. \nMost expect the intensity to only increase throughout the 188-lap race. \n“There's some unwritten rules that guys go by it seems like,” Martin Truex Jr. said. “When it comes down to the Chase, when it comes down to having a chance to win the championship, it seems like guys are willing to cross the line and do things that they probably normally wouldn’t do. \n“You get one or two blocks, then you're going for a spin. Guys get frustrated when they get blocked, especially when it's coming down to the end. If there's points on the line or a chance to win, you’re not going to stand being blocked.” \nThat generally leads to disaster. \nThere was a 14-car crash in last May’s race at Talladega and different crashes involving 10, six and five cars in last October’s 500-miler. \nEarnhardt was in the five-car pileup a year ago and it cost him a spot in the playoffs. \n“Even if we don’t make it through this weekend, I think it’s still going to be exciting,” Earnhardt said. “This one [playoffs] has been pretty intense. We’ve seen some guys get wrecked. I, myself, got wrecked. \n“So, who knows what’s left? I’m excited to see it and hopefully I’m a part of it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:21:12.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
