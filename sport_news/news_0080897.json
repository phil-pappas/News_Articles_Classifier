(Photo: USA TODAY Sports) \nBased on what Nick Saban said during Wednesday's SEC coaches call, you'd think Arkansas was the 16-point favorite instead of No. 8 Alabama. \nHe showered the Razorbacks with praise like Niagara Falls. \n\"Arkansas has got a really, really good team that I think are playing better and better.\" \n\"They do a great job with their scheme. They play blockers well. They're physical. Their linebackers are very instinctive. They get good secondary support.\" \n\"Hunter Henry is probably, in my mind, maybe the best tight end in the country.\" \nSomewhere Bret Bielema was probably blushing. \n\"I appreciate what Coach Saban said about (Henry),\" Bielema said. \nDon't get too caught up in the rapture of Saban's love like Anita Baker, Coach. \nAlabama (4-1, 1-1) is gaining momentum on offense, special teams and its defense is made to stop a run-oriented team. The Crimson Tide know they can't afford another loss in trying to win the SEC and make the College Football Playoff. \nSo Alabama won't take Arkansas (2-3, 1-1) lightly Saturday night at Bryant-Denny Stadium. If the Razorbacks come into this game all chesty like Chuck Amato, they'll fall hard like Georgia did. \nLast week, Saban praised Georgia to the high heavens, saying the Bulldogs reminded him of his past great Alabama teams. \n\"Very physical,\" Saban said about the then No. 8 Bulldogs. \"Don't make a lot of mistakes. Don't beat themselves much, and they play with a lot of toughness. They're very aggressive on both sides of the ball. That's the kind of team we kind of always sort of aspired to have here, and it certainly looks like that's the kind of team they have developed there.\" \nGeorgia came out for pregame hopping around like Miami did back in the day when \"The U\" was really \"The U.\" Then Alabama rolled into Athens and ramshacked the Bulldogs, 38-10, at Sanford Stadium. \nNow Alabama faces Arkansas, and Saban is showing Arkansas more love than a Michael Bolton song. \n\"Very physical team that runs the ball well,\" Saban said. \"Quarterback plays well. Their defense really plays well. It's going to be a real challenge for us.\" \nSounds familiar right? \nNow Saban has many reasons to respect Arkansas. The Razorbacks earned a 24-20 gut-check win at Tennessee last week and gave Alabama all it could handle in last year's 14-13 loss. \nAlex Collins has churned out at least 150 yards rushing in each of his last three games. The Razorbacks are third in the SEC in total offense and run defense. Arkansas is averaging 476 yards a game and giving up just 101.6 yards rushing a game. \nOut of 343 plays, Arkansas has only allowed two sacks. So they've protected senior Brandon Allen, who is second in the SEC in passing yards per game at 272. He's thrown eight touchdowns, just three interceptions and completed 66 percent of his passes (93-of-141) for 1,360 yards. \nAs for Henry, the junior has 20 catches for 268 yards that includes a 51-yard reception last week and a touchdown. He's not as good as A.J. Derby was last season, but at 6 feet, 5 inches tall and 253 pounds, Henry has the look of a future NFL player. \n\"He's got great size, is very athletic and a very good receiver, but he blocks well and does everything that you could ask a guy to do,\" Saban said, who later called Henry \"the perfect tight end.\" \nCompliments aside, there's two sides to every coin. \nThe Razorbacks came into the season ranked 18th in the AP preseason poll, 20th in the coaches' poll, but have a losing record. Their wins are against teams without a winning record. UTEP and Tennessee are both 2-3. \nSaban says Arkansas is playing better and better, but it had lost three straight games with the first defeat coming against mid-major Toledo at home. \nArkansas is last in the SEC in pass defense and pass defense efficiency. The Razorbacks' five opponents have completed 71.6 percent of their passes against them. \nArkansas only has four sacks this season, and opponents are picking up first downs on third down 45.5 percent of the time. The Razorbacks are also next to last in the SEC in penalties (34 for 309 yards). \nOn top of that, Arkansas has lost eight straight to Alabama and been outscored, 125-21, by the Tide in its last three trips in Tuscaloosa. Last time the Razorbacks played at Bryant-Denny Stadium, it fell, 52-0, in 2013. \n\"That was probably one of the most embarrassing losses for me personally as a head coach,\" Bielema said. \nBielema needs to make sure he and his players remember that score and the other side of their coin far more than Saban's praises about them, or they'll experience another humbling road loss to the Tide.
