I'm just happy all this is over now and I can put this behind me, knowing my name has been cleared,\" Sefolosha told reporters.\nSefolosha, who wiped his eyes with a tissue after the verdict was announced, could consider filing a civil suit against the New York Police Department, but \"I haven't made a decision on that.\"\nSefolosha sustained a season-ending fibula fracture during his arrest and blamed the NYPD for his injury.\n\"They arrested him,\" Sefolosha's attorney, Alex Spiro, said in his closing argument. \"They broke his leg out of eyeshot or earshot of an unrelated crime scene.\"\nAccording to the New York Times, Sefolosha turned down a plea bargain that would have resulted in the charges being dropped if he did a day of community service and stayed out of trouble for six months.\nTMZ had published a video that it said showed five officers surrounding Sefolosha at the scene and trying to take hold of him. The video appeared to show one officer grabbing Sefolosha by the back of the neck before bringing him down to the ground.\nCopeland suffered a knife wound to his left elbow and abdomen in the incident outside the nightclub. He also had a fractured elbow that required surgery.\nSefolosha averaged 5.3 points, 4.3 rebounds and 1.4 assists last season before being sidelined by the injury.\nSefolosha, who still isn't fully healed from his surgery, continues to undergo rehab as the NBA season starts Oct. 27.\n\"I've started running and playing a little bit more; it's starting to feel better, but I don't know exactly,\" Sefolosha said Friday of his prognosis. \"I hope I still have a long career ahead of me.\"\n  Hawks acquire Sefolosha from OKC Hawks' Carroll out vs. Trail Blazers NYPD investigates NBA player arrest Report: Indiana Pacers' Copeland stabbed at NYC nightclub NBA Game Summary - Charlotte at Atlanta", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:41:50.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
