A lot of variables, a lot of things went wrong. “There’s no need to point fingers. That’s in the past, and it’s over. I learned a lot from it. I came into this situation and knew it was going to be a good situation for me. “One, being behind a guy like Tony (Romo) and being in this system with a great staff. Coach (Jason) Garrett is a former backup quarterback, so he can relate. “We all want an opportunity to go out and play and be a starter and be a good player on a good football team.” Weeden’s former Browns teammate Jabaal Sheard is with New England now and will be rushing Weeden. “He was always real quiet, a super quiet guy,” Weeden said. “He would always walk around with a sweatshirt with a hood on. He had the dreads. He worked his tail off, and when it came to Sunday, he was ready to go.” The Browns’ best performance during Weeden’s two years with the team might have been a 27-26 loss at New England. “I got a concussion the week before (against Jacksonville) and didn’t even make the trip to Foxborough,” Weeden said. Jason Campbell had the Browns in position to win until they failed to recover an onside kick and let Brady drive for a last-second touchdown. Missing Browns Safety Tashaun Gipson (ankle), safety Donte Whitner (illness) and linebacker Craig Robertson (ankle) sat out the Browns’ Wednesday practice. Starters who missed Baltimore’s Wednesday session were wide receiver Steve Smith (back), defensive end Chris Canty (calf) and tight end Crockett Gilmore (calf). Rookie wideout Breshad Perriman, a No. 26 overall draft pick, hasn’t played this year due to a knee injury and isn’t practicing. Pass rusher Terrell Suggs is on injured reserve. Extra points Baltimore’s Justin Forsett will turn 30 three days after the Browns game. Guys that age aren’t supposed to run 150 yards at Pittsburgh, as Forsett did last Thursday. Baltimore quarterback Joe Flacco practiced against Paul Kruger for four years before Kruger jumped to the Browns. “He’s a smart player,” Flacco said. “He can drop in coverage. He can get after the passer. He can get in there and stop the run and be physical. When he’s at his best, he’s able to slap guys’ hands down, get around them and under them, and get after the quarterback.” Flacco is 13-1 in his starts against the Browns, but he isn’t assuming a win. “That’s not how it works, man,” he said. “The Browns games are some of the toughest games I’ve played in.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T09:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:50:22.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
