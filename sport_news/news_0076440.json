An 18-year-old first-round draft pick, Preston shipped off to Florida’s Gulf Coast League and showed up his first morning at Vero Beach to take batting practice with his new teammates.\nOn the mound was a short, white-haired man he recognized, throwing and talking, throwing and talking. It was Terry Collins, then four years into his tenure as the Dodgers’ farm director.\n“And he was talking (expletive), pretty much,” Mattingly recalled. “It was almost like he was one of us.”\nThere, on the back fields of the Dodgers’ system, Collins found he could be. The man twice deemed too tightly wound to find success in the big leagues is the Mets manager now, the oldest in the major leagues, one of only four working on his third chance. He knows that it is his final chance, and that this week’s National League Division Series against the Dodgers presents an opportunity to begin to convert that chance.\nAlso in Vero Beach that day was Clayton Kershaw. He had just signed, too, and right around then he threw his first bullpen session. Watching was Rick Honeycutt, then the Dodgers’ minor-league pitching coordinator, now their major-league pitching coach. He ran into Collins walking from one field to the next.\n“He stopped and said, ‘Have you seen this Kershaw guy?” Collins recalled Thursday. “And I said, ‘No, not yet.’ He went, ‘Oh, wow.’\n“And he turned around and walked away.”\nCollins told that story twice Thursday, once to the local writers and again in a news conference, broadcast live nationally. Collins has both an incisive personality and the willingness to expose it in public, an increasingly unusual combination of traits among major-league managers.\nDodgers outfielder Scott Van Slyke has known Collins since he was a kid. His father, Andy, played for the Pirates while Collins served as Jim Leyland’s bullpen coach, and then Van Slyke saw him again when drafted by the Dodgers.\nHe said Collins was “very nose-to-the-grindstone.”\n“His job, for a long time, was dealing with kids that are 18 to 25 years old who thought they knew everything,” Van Slyke said. “I’m sure there's a transition there from going to that job to this one. Here, there's probably an adjustment period of, ‘Hey, you know, these guys are grown men.’”\nCollins once told the New York Post that working in player development permanently changed his approach to managing, forcing him to be more patient.\n“Because patience was not part of my makeup,” Collins said. “I wanted instant gratification now.”\nOn Thursday, Collins said he owes his managerial career to the late Dodgers executive Bill Schweppe, who traded for him as a minor leaguer in 1974 and got him started as a manager following his playing career.\n“I learned baseball,” he said. “I learned Dodger baseball. And, at a time when you can walk out on the field in spring training and you had Drysdale, and Koufax, and Maury Wills, and Wes Parker, and Roy Campanella was talking after dinner at night. You talk about learning baseball and learning the history of the game, I spent a little time in that training camp.\n“So I learned everything here.”\nMaybe more appropriately, he learned a lot. Elsewhere, in farm directing and managing the Astros and the Angels, he picked up the rest, and found out how to be taken seriously, trusted, and not feared, all at the same time.\nA well-publicized veteran mutiny ended his tenure in Anaheim in 1999. He was deemed too emotional to be trusted. The next managing job he had was in Japan. It took him 11 years to get another opportunity in America, and his first four years in New York were not wonderful.\nIt’s not that he was always too abrasive. Preston Mattingly said Collins “always seemed to relate” to him. But current Mets say Collins has sufficiently mellowed out for everybody.\n“He’s not intimidating at all, which is great,” said Mets midseason acquisition Tyler Clippard. “Because you feel like you can go up to your skipper at any time and have any conversation you want with him.”\nRight-hander Addison Reed headed for the Mets’ Citi Field clubhouse for the first time around 1 p.m. on Aug. 31. The previous night, New York had acquired the 26-year-old from the Arizona Diamondbacks, and he flew over wondering what kind of role he’d have on baseball’s hottest team.\nCollins intercepted him before he entered the clubhouse, introduced himself and ushered Reed into his office. They chatted. Collins proceeded to give him a personalized walking tour of the ballpark, welcoming the man who’d emerge as the Mets’ seventh-inning set-up man.\n“The short time I’ve been here, he’s been awesome,” said Reed. “He’s been up-front. He’s been straightforward. What he tells you is what’s going to happen.”\nContact the writer: pmoura@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:06:40.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
