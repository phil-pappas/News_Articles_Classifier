So we are probably going to get Jonny scanned tomorrow,” Schmidt said. \nOn O’Mahony, the Kiwi coach added: “it didn’t seem too bad, we are hopeful with Pete. I think it’s a twisted ankle or knee. He was walking pretty well in the changing room and hopefully he’ll be OK”. \nO’Brien, who was a lion in the loose at flanker, faces an anxious wait for a different reason. \nImages showing O’Brien punching France second-rower Pascal Pape in the stomach in the first minute of the match have Irish fans fearing the No.7 may be banned. \nO’Brien could be cited by a disciplinary commissioner, but Schmidt said he did not think O’Brien had punched intentionally. \n“I truly hope not,” Schmidt replied when asked whether he thought O’Brien would face a ban. \n“I think he was being held at the time, he swung, I don’t think he was looking directly at the player. \n“Hopefully it’s not something that impacts on us considering the dressing room at the moment with the amount of injuries we have. \n“We can ill afford to lose another player, particularly a player of Sean’s experience and standing in the group.” \nSexton kicked two early penalties for the Irish before going off. His replacement Ian Madigan kicked a penalty of his own and Scott Spedding booted two long-range efforts for France. \nThe Six Nations champions scored two second-half tries through Rob Kearney and Connor Murray, Madigan adding a conversion and late penalty. \nFrance’s sole points in the second period came from a Morgan Parra penalty.
