A final vote is set for Oct. 21.\nThe new measure would give businesses that made it through the red tape at the state level a head start as Portland prepares to license recreational-marijuana stores. The city will start accepting license applications Dec. 1, with approvals on a first-come, first-served basis.\nUnder the newest proposal, dispensaries would be exempt from the 1,000-foot buffer if they were registered and operating with the Oregon Health Authority before July 1, 2015. The current cutoff is Jan. 1, 2015.\nIn addition, the date could be moved up to Sept. 30, 2015, for businesses that can show they made \"significant financial obligations,\" such as hiring employees or signing a lease, before then.\nAfter four public hearings, private meetings with city staff and town hall meetings, marijuana industry advocates and consultants largely praised the revised rules Wednesday.\n\"There's been a lot of progress made,\" said Amy Margolis, an attorney with Emerge Law Group who specializes in marijuana issues.\nCommissioner Dan Saltzman also introduced an amendment that would waive the 1,000-foot business buffer downtown and in the Lloyd District, which he said would attract a new kind of tourism.\n\"We should be encouraging competition, encouraging these businesses to open in the central city,\" Saltzman said. Tourists who come to Portland for marijuana should find restaurants and hotels nearby.\n\"I don't think there's any downside to it. It's strictly upside,\" Saltzman said.\nSamuel Grosz, a Portland tax attorney who served on a state marijuana committee, said Saltzman's proposal was a good one, but challenging to implement. Most downtown real estate property is backed by commercial mortgages, Grosz said, and those mortgages have clauses that require compliance with local, state and federal laws. Marijuana is illegal at the federal level. \"Large institutional investors will not allow those types of business to operate,\" he said.\nThe City Council disagreed with Saltzman's plan, voting no 4-1.\n\"I want to keep the door open to this idea later,\" said Mayor Charlie Hales. \"But I don't think it's ripe yet.\"\nPortland also changed the hours of operation for marijuana businesses. Under the new plan, business could open at 8 a.m. and close as late as 10 p.m, one hour later than previously proposed.\n-- Andrew Theen\natheen@oregonian.com\n503-294-4026\n@cityhallwatch", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:20:19.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
