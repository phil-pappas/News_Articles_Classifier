Australian amateur champion Cameron Davis and countryman Ryan Ruffels, the highest-ranked amateur in the field at No. 8, were one behind after 67s. \nWinds picked up late in the day, toppling a crane used for TV coverage, but there were no reports of injuries. \nThe weather forecast for Sunday was for storms and continuing high winds and the threat of a typhoon, forcing organizers to tell players in a statement that if the fourth round is not played, the 54-hole scores would determine the winner. Tee times for Sunday were in threesomes off two tees, with the last groups off at 8:30 a.m. \n\"We needed to make as much of a move as we could today, and if we get a chance tomorrow to play, then great,\" Davis said. \nRuffels added: \"Our coaches told us that conditions were going to be pretty average tomorrow. It would have been great to be sitting at the top after 54.\" \nYu Chun-an (67) of Taiwan and South Korea's Kim Tae-ho (69), were tied for fourth, three behind. Defending champion Antonio Murdaca of Australia, who won last year at Royal Melbourne, shot 64 to move into sixth place, four off the lead. \nGuan Tianlang of China, the 2012 champion, shot 74 Saturday and was well off the pace at 5-over, tied for 47th and 16 strokes behind. \nThe tournament champion receives an invitation to next year's Masters. The champion and runner-up receive a place in the final round of qualifying for the 2016 British Open at Royal Troon. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T10:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:12:58.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
