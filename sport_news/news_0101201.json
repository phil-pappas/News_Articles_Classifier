Despite their inability to stop the run against William & Mary, the Wildcats had a chance to take the lead at halftime. However, a dropped touchdown pass in the end zone on the last play of the first half turned out to be the beginning of the end for UNH, which made too many mistakes on offense and special teams to overcome their deficiencies on defense. “We had opportunities to stay in the game,” coach Sean McDonnell said during Monday’s CAA teleconference. “At times we played well enough to win.” Trailing 21-15, the Wildcats missed a chip shot field goal on their first possession of the second half. They also fumbled a punt snap that led to a touchdown and had another one blocked that led to a TD on the next play. An ill-timed penalty on that last drive nullified a first down in William & Mary territory early in the fourth quarter. Senior quarterback Sean Goldrich threw two interceptions in his first game back from an ankle injury and was sacked five times. “He got better as the game went on,” McDonnell said. “I think some of the rust was there after missing four weeks of football. What I really saw as the game went along was he started to get back to the Sean Goldrich we know who can win football games in this conference.” The offense had to be nearly perfect to offset a defense that gave up 325 yards rushing, 233 in the first half. Four of the Tribe’s five touchdowns came on the ground. “We had a huge problem stopping the run,” McDonnell said. “We didn’t do what we needed to do defensively to win the football game.” Offensively, they were limited to 281 yards. Dalton Crossan gained 109 of those yards on 16 carries, including 37 on a TD run that gave UNH a 13-7 lead early in the second quarter. Tight end Matt Torrey caught a two-point conversion pass that made it 15-7. However, the Tribe scored 27 unanswered points as the Wildcats had no answer for the William & Mary ground game led by Kendell Anderson, who rushed for 174 yards on 27 attempts with two TDs. UNH’s other touchdown came on a 90-yard punt return by Casey DeAndrade early in the first quarter. The junior cornerback also had a busy day on defense with nine tackles and two pass breakups. The Wildcats fell to 0-7 at William & Mary under McDonnell and 1-10 overall in Williamsburg. They also dropped to 3-3 this season and 1-2 in the CAA going into Saturday’s game at Delaware, another team that likes to run the football. “It’s a huge concern,” McDonnell said. “They’re geared to run the football. I think they run it 68 percent of the time. They’ve got a big, physical offensive line. They’ve run the ball against everybody they’ve played.” The Blue Hens average 244 yards rushing per game to rank second in the CAA while UNH ranks 11th against the run. Delaware (2-4, 1-2 CAA) is coming off a bye week following a 20-0 loss at Rhode Island. The Blue Hens only league win came against William & Mary, 24-23, at home. The Wildcats are 2-0 this season after a loss. All their losses have come on the road. They haven’t played at Delaware since dropping a 16-3 decision in 2010 in the NCAA playoffs. “I think it’s one of the best places to play at our level of football,” said McDonnell, whose club defeated the Blue Hens, 43-14, last season at Cowell Stadium. “Everyone’s on top of you. It’s just an electric place with a great tradition.” By Al Pike", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:34:41.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
