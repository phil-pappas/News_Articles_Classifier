Tom Smart, Summary \nJazz coach Quin Snyder was happy that the turnover number was lower against Portland on Monday and says he may have talked too much about turnovers previously. “ Ive almost done us a disservice by talking about it too much. Its something youre aware of for sure. We had a bundle against the Lakers. But as long as theres an awareness, were going to keep getting better.” Jazz head coach Quin Snyder \nSALT LAKE CITY — One of the few good things to come out of Utah’s 88-81 loss to Portland Monday night was that the Jazz turnover number was relatively low at 14. \nThat’s not great — about the same as the Jazz averaged per game last year — but after turning the ball over 41 times in the previous two games — 22 against the Lakers and 19 against Phoenix — it was a giant improvement. \n“We took care of the ball better,’’ said Jazz coach Quin Snyder. “I guess you’d rather have (fewer) turnovers than shoot the ball better.’’ \nSnyder was referring to his team’s atrocious shooting against the Blazers, just 31 percent from the field and 22 percent from 3-point range, indicating that it’s easier to correct poor shooting than being too careless with the ball. \nThe Jazz coach also apologized for harping too much on the Jazz turnovers as he often did last year when Utah ranked 22nd in the league in turnovers per game. \n“I’ve almost done us a disservice by talking about it too much,’’ he said. “It’s something you’re aware of for sure. We had a bundle against the Lakers. But as long as there’s an awareness, we’re going to keep getting better.’’ \nSnyder said part of the reason for the excessive turnovers in a couple of games this year has been because of the team’s youth. \n“Part of it is having a young team,’’ he said. “We have a lot of guys where the game is going really fast for them. A lot of it is we don’t know each other that well yet. Individual players as they get older the game slows down, decisions get easier and hopefully we see that over the course of the season.’’ \nASSISTS LACKING: Snyder wasn’t happy about the fact that the Jazz had only 13 assists for the second straight game with his two point guards, Trey Burke and Raul Neto combining for a single assist with just two the previous game. \n“The ball sticks when you’re not efficient and you’re not spaced well and there’s nowhere to pass it,’’ he said. \nJazz players aren’t happy about the lack of assists either but have explanations for it. \n“I think we had some great passes, but we just didn’t make shots,’’ said Alec Burks. “Some shots go in, some go out. Some days are good some days are bad, that’s all it was.’’ \n“It’s just learning the offense and the more me, Raul, Bryce, Alec, the more the offense gets familiar to us and get guys in their positions, the more the assist numbers will go up,’’ said Trey Burke. “We have an unselfish team and we’ve got to continue to play unselfish and move the ball.’’ \nUNSETTLED: The Jazz haven’t settled on a starting lineup or even a set rotation with the season less than two weeks away, but Snyder says it may not be settled for awhile. \nHe indicated earlier this week that he needs to have some experience with the second unit, which means guys like Burks and Burke could come off the bench, allowing players such as Rodney Hood and Raul Neto to start. Snyder also said things are never set in stone as far as lineups and rotations go. \n“That’s a process that never really ends over the course of the season with your team,’’ he said. “We know our players and we’ll try different combinations. It’s important to see how guys play together . . . but we’re probably not going to play Raul and Trey together and go small. It may change various games with matchups, foul trouble, so I don’t think it’s a static decision.’’ \nJAZZ NOTES: The Jazz will hold an open practice Friday night at EnergySolutions Arena. It will begin at 6:30 p.m. with doors opening at 5:30 p.m. Coach Snyder will put his team through a typical practice and explain to the crowd what is happening on the floor . . . Former Chicago Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau was on hand for Jazz practice again Wednesday . . . The Jazz leave Saturday for a game Sunday night in Portland and conclude the preseason with a pair of games next week against Oklahoma City Tuesday night and Denver Thursday night . . . The regular season begins Oct. 28 at Detroit.
