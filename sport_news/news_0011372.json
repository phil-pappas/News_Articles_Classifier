Russell had five TD passes and ran 14 times for 160 yards with another score. BOX SCORE: Baylor vs. West Virginia \nBaylor's only regular-season loss last year was 41-27 at West Virginia, and the Bears wound up the first team left out of the initial College Football Playoff. \nSkyler Howard, from Fort Worth, Texas, less than 100 miles from the Baylor campus, threw four TD passes for West Virginia (3-3, 0-3). \n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
