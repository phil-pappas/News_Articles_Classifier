Posted: Monday, October 26, 2015 1:31 am TCSF moves up, Central draws Big Reds By JAMES COOK jcook@record-eagle.com Record-Eagle.com \nTRAVERSE CITY — Traverse City St. Francis is moving on up, and Traverse City Central is hosting one of its storied rivals. \nThe football postseason officially kicked off Sunday with the playoff field and first-round matchups announced in all eight divisions. \nSt. Francis and Central not surprisingly will host first-round games after going undefeated in the regular season. \nThe Trojans (9-0) host Muskegon (7-2) at Thirlby Field in a game that will be Friday at 7 p.m., Central athletic director Mark Mattson confirmed. \nSt. Francis (9-0) hosts Glen Lake (5-4) Saturday at 1 p.m. at Thirlby, St. Francis athletic director Tom Hardy said. \nMoving up to Division 6 puts the Gladiators in the same bracket as powerhouse Ithaca. \nHarbor Springs' 22-20 upset of Charlevoix propelled the Rams into the Division 7 field, a move that could have been the one to bump St. Francis up. \nThrowing more variables into the mix were a significant number of schools leaving to play 8-player football this year. St. Francis also saw an enrollment increase of 15. \n\"We thought for sure next year we were going to be (Division 6),\" St. Francis coach Josh Sellers said. \"We just hit it a year early.\" \nSt. Francis and Ithaca — which has lost only one game in the last seasons — wouldn't meet until the semifinals. \n\"At any point, it doesn't matter,\" Sellers said. \"You have to win the games.\" \nSellers is focusing on Glen Lake, which the Glads beat 41-7 in Week Seven. \n\"We told the kids that's not even part of our memory for us,\" Sellers said after the team watched the selection show on television at Immaculate Conception Elementary. \"That first game doesn't matter. We have to prepare for them like we would any other team. Being familiar with each other helps both staffs game plan.\" \nTC Central drew a tough task in Muskegon, one of state's most consistent teams. You have to go back to 1999 to find the last Big Reds team that didn't win seven or more games. They've gone 12-2 each of the last three seasons. \n\"Obviously, it's a tough opponent ahead of us, but in the playoffs, that's what you're going to go up against,\" Central coach Eric Schugars said after the team watched the selection show at Peegeo's. \"It's a great opportunity for us.\" \nThe Big Reds have played in the state finals each of the previous three seasons, losing to Orchard Lake St. Mary's 7-0 in last year's Division 3 title game and falling to Birmingham Brother Rice in the Division 2 final in 2013 and 2012 by scores of 38-21 and 35-28, respectively. \n\"We know they're a storied program and have a tradition and history,\" Schugars said. \"We're making history ourselves, so we're excited to get after them.\" \nOnly four schools still in existence that have played Muskegon more than two times have an above-.500 record against the Big Red. One of those is Traverse City Central. \n\"We want to teach our guys about that history,\" Schugars said. \"Before we practice, that's something we're going to do — talk about that tradition, that rivalry that exists between our two schools.\" \nThe Trojans played against Muskegon in a summer 7-on-7 game, although scores weren't kept. They also faced Muskegon Mona Shores (9-0), a team in the district's other half. \n\"We've had a great year, Big North Conference champs, undefeated,\" Schugars said. \"Now it's the playoffs. Now it's a chance to prove that 9-0 record.\" \nSeven other area schools also punched their ticket to the postseason. \nGaylord (6-3) and Petoskey (7-2) are in the same Division 3 district. The Blue Devils will travel to face Mt. Pleasant at 1 p.m. Saturday, while the Northmen host Sault Ste. Marie (6-3) at 7 p.m. Friday. \nManistee heads to play Reed City at 7 p.m. Friday in Division 5, while Grayling (6-3) travels to play Menominee (9-0). Vikings coach Tim Sanchez said their game time will be set Monday. \nFrankfort (7-2) hosts Baldwin (4-4) at 7 p.m. Friday — the only team in the state to get into the postseason with four wins — in Division 8, while Central Lake (7-2) travels to play Onekama (7-2) at 7 p.m. Friday. \nCharlevoix and Kingsley both finished 5-4, but weren't included in the field despite higher playoff point totals than Baldwin. \nArea matchups \nMuskegon (7-2) at TC Central (9-0), Friday, 7 p.m. \nDIVISION 3 \nGaylord (6-3) at Mt.
