We had 12 errors in the first and nine in the last two games.\"\nBut the Warriors stepped it up at the service line and put the Bearcats on their heels for Games 2 and 3.\nFreshmen Alex Fortuna was especially effective rolling off three straight aces during a 6-0 run in Game 2. She finished with a match-high seven aces.\nKuechenberg tore it up at the line in Game 3, scoring the game's final seven points recording aces for points 20, 22, 23 and 24.\nThe Bearcats (17-6, 5-2) looked overmatched the final two games.\n\"The first game was the team I saw against Munster Monday night,\" Wheeler coach Alisha Brown said. \"We struggled (the last two games). They exploited our serve receive and that was it.\"\nNoll senior libero Delaney Soto kept the defense strong with nine digs, while junior Brittany Anderson contributed 20 assists, six digs, five kills and three aces.\nRodriguez said his team is not done, though.\n\"This is a big deal because it hasn't happened in 21 years.\" He said. \"But it's still just a share and we want to go out and do it the right way.\"\nWheeler was led by Allison Stills (6 kills), Shawn McKenna (3 aces, 7 digs) and Belle Bravo (14 assists).\nWheeler seeks swim coach: Wheeler High School is seeking a girls swimming head coach.
