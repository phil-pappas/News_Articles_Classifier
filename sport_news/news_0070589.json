I know they are disappointed that it wasn't an outright win, but it doesn't take away from this accomplishment, especially to shoot 9-under on this golf course. We now have one more event to possibly compete the greatest semester in Wake Forest golf history.\" \nThe victory marks the first time since 1980-81 that the Demon Deacons won three events during the fall semester. Wake Forest also won the Rod Myers Invitational at Duke in September and the Nike Golf Collegiate Championship earlier this month. \nYoung shot a final-round 73 to finish at 6-under, in a four-way tie atop the individual leaderboard. Sophomore Will Zalatoris posted a 4-under round of 68 to finish in the top-five at 5-under, one shot off the lead. \nAfter shooting over par the first two rounds, freshman Lee Detmer bounced back with a 2-under final round of 70. Sophomore Paul McBride had a top-25 finish with a three-round score of two-over, while Davis Womble finished the tournament at seven-over. \nThe Demon Deacons conclude the fall portion of their 2015-16 schedule next month as they travel to Hawaii for the Warrior Princeville Makai Invitational, held Nov. 2-4 on the island of Kauai.
