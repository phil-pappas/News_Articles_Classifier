He will be eligible for the WHL 20-Year-Old Cutdown Waiver Draft on Thursday, Oct. 15. If Hughson is not claimed in the waiver draft, he will become a free agent. \n“Garret took great steps as a person and as an athlete during his three years with our team,” said Chiefs General Manager Tim Speltz. “We want to thank him for his contribution.” \nHughson, from Foremost, Alta., played three full seasons with the Chiefs, highlighted by the 2014-15 season during which he posted career bests in save percentage (.902), goals against average (2.80) and wins (23) in 53 appearances. In 105 career games, he has a 41-38-5-2 record with a 3.07 GAA and .895 SV% with four shutouts. \n“We feel, as an organization, that we need to commit to Tyson Verhelst and Matt Berlin as our goaltenders for this season and our future,” Speltz continued. “The Spokane Chiefs wish Garret all the best moving forward.” \nThe move leaves Spokane with two goaltenders on the roster in 18-year-old sophomore Tyson Verhelst and 17-year-old rookie Matt Berlin. Verhelst has appeared in five games this season, winning three while posting a .921 save percentage and 2.56 goals against average. He played in 26 games last season, earning an 11-11-0-0 record with one shutout. Berlin has yet to appear in a game. \nThe Chiefs return to Spokane Arena this weekend for the first time since Sept. 26 to face   on Friday, Oct. 16 and the Kamloops Blazers on Saturday, Oct. 17. \nFriday night will be Cenex Zip Trip Magnet Schedule Giveaway Night (first 3,000 fans) while Saturday will be the Fifth Annual Leinenkugel’s HOCKtoberfest & Leavenworth Weekend Giveaway, with pre-game festivities including Bavarian-themed food and drink starting outside Spokane Arena at 4 p.m. Local Sports from SWX Local Sports from SWX More>> Bloomsday 2015: Road Closures, Parking and Bus Routes SPOKANE, Wash. - With tens of thousands of people converging on downtown Spokane this weekend for Bloomsday, we wanted to make sure you know about all the road closures you may run into.
