Everybody has a job to do, and just do your job and just keep battling, keep competing.\"\nStrong on his message to the team\n\"I said to them after the game, I said, if you think about us, guys, you look at the two opponents we've played the last two weeks and look where we are and just how far we've come; it's our own fault that we've been in the position we're in. We have to learn how to just go close out games. Everybody has a job to do, and just do your job and just keep battling, keep competing.\"\nStrong on if he feels unlucky\n\"I don't always [feel unlucky] - but you know what, a lot of times we've got to create our own, and we've got to create plays. You look at it, you look at that game there on Saturday, and we have our chances. We don't have a dropped ball here and then just them making a stop, we take the will out of them to take the ball ... we had our opportunities.\"\nStrong on the upcoming game against TCU\n\"It's going to be a big challenge this week. TCU is a very good football team. I think they're No. 3 or No. 4 in the polls. The thing we're going to have to do is just go out this week and make sure the preparation -- we have to be on point because in order for us to go forward and play an unbelievable game. We're going to have to start -- has to start tomorrow.\"\nSenior wide receiver Marcus Johnson on the team's mentality\n\"It's too early to give up So we have to continue to know that these last two games, the difference in points, and the record we have now ... it's still not what is should be and we can't make excuses for it. And we have to find a way to turn it around.\"\nJohnson on the message sent at Texas' players-only meeting\nAt some point, we have to make up our minds that those three point losses and the little things throughout the game, we have to stand up and say 'we need to make the difference. [The coaches] are putting us in the right position. They're making the right play calls. We just have to capitalize as players.\nSenior offensive guard Sedrick Flowers on if the team can hang with TCU\nI think we're capable of hanging with any team. Our offense when we get going we're putting points up ... Our defense is coming around. We saw how they did in this past game. I feel like when we play on all cylinders we can compete with any team.\nTexas coach Charlie Strong: \"It's our fault we're in the position we're in.\" Not biting on officiating question.\n— Chuck Carlton (@ChuckCarltonDMN) September 28, 2015\nTexas opened as an 18.5-point underdog at TCU this Saturday (via http://t.co/n45oSO9iJz ).
