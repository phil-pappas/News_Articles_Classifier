With the team ahead 3-0 in the NLCS , the New York Mets website accidentally and prematurely posted an advertisement for National League pennant and World Series apparel, along with a logo that declared the Mets to be \"National League champions.\" It was corrected on the site, but not before internet hunters found the mistake and posted screen captures. \n'The pennant will rise.' Oh, will it? (MLB) \nIncluded: A blue shirt with the phrase 'The pennant will rise,\" along with a light-colored cap with \"World Series\" and a Mets \"NY\" logo on the front panel. Perhaps most premature, the logo calling the team \"National League champions.\" It looks good for the Mets as of Wednesday night, but they still need to beat the Chicago Cubs one more time for it to be real. They play at Wrigley Field tonight in Game 4 . \nWanting to get a jump on sales is understandable, considering the Mets haven't won a pennant since 2000, but this is not the kind of glitch you want to show the world until it's time. \nAnd it's just what the Cubs needed: More electronic bulletin-board fodder to motivate them in the face of long odds. Only once in the history of a best-of-seven postgame series has a team come back from three games down to win. They'd probably like nothing more than to render the shirts -- which also exist in reality, just stowed in a closet somewhere -- to be useless for marketing purposes. \nThis isn't the first time a team has made a premature call like this. Even this season. Remember when the Dodgers own network called them \"NL champions\" when they won the NL West? That didn't happen in real life either.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:51:14.967+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
