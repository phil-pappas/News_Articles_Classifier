The touchdowns come by run or pass, from short and long distance, at home and on the road, from starters and backups. \nThe resurgence continued Saturday night with a 55-17 victory over Arizona in which the Cardinal gained 570 total yards, scored on its first eight possessions and didn't punt until early in the fourth quarter.

(Marcio Jose Sanchez/Associated Press) \n\"We didn't stop anything they wanted to do,'' Arizona coach Rich Rodriguez said. \"They wanted to throw, they threw. They wanted to run, they ran.\" \nThe same offense that produced six points at Northwestern has reeled off 41, 42 and 55 in successive weeks against Pac-12 competition. \nNot since Andrew Luck's final season (2011) had Stanford scored at least 40 points in three consecutive games. \n\"I think we've finally established our identity,'' Hogan said. \"We want to be balanced offensively. The line is jelling right now and the running backs are all doing a great job. That makes it easy on me.\" Advertisement \nHogan was sharp for the third game in a row, completing 17 of 19 passes for 217 yards before departing. Tailback Christian McCaffrey produced 260 all-purpose yards. Remound Wright scored three touchdowns. Four receivers caught at least three passes. \n\"I can't say enough about our quarterback and the leadership he's giving us'' coach David Shaw said. \"He's playing the best of his career and the guys are responding to him.\" \nOn the other end of the spectrum: Arizona. \nThe Wildcats were without their starter, Anu Solomon (concussion). His replacement, Jerrard Randall, threw for a paltry 43 yards in the first half as Stanford built a 27-3 lead. \nWithout fear of Arizona's downfield passing game, the Cardinal (4-1, 3-0) stacked the line of scrimmage and held Arizona tailback Nick Wilson, who averaged a league-leading 143 yards per game, to 46. \nStanford linebacker Blake Martinez, a Tucson native who wasn't offered a scholarship by Arizona, collected a game-high 13 tackles. \nMartinez downplayed any personal significance before the game but admitted afterward that it was \"awesome,\" especially for his mother, Carrisa, an Arizona alum. \"Now I have bragging rights back home,'' he said. \nStanford has a week off to prepare for the anticipated Thursday night date with UCLA. \nThe collision should help establish Pac-12 supremacy and potentially impact positioning for the college football playoff. Then again, the only sure bet in the conference this year is chaos. \nAs sharp as Stanford has looked for three weeks, it could get derailed at any point. \n\"It's the Wild West every week,'' Shaw said. \"But every week, our level has to rise. We have to play better in 10 days than we played today.'' For more on college sports, see Jon Wilner's College Hotline at blogs.mercurynews.com/collegesports .
