Every day, man.''\nIndeed. And while he already won last year's NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award, he's close to completing the triple crown for receivers through their first tour of the league. A decent day against the Bills on Sunday would give him two, a great day would give him all three.\nBeckham already holds the NFL record for receptions (110) through a player's first 16 games. He needs 20 receiving yards to pass Bill Groman's 1961 record of 1,593 through the opening 16 games of a career. He needs three touchdowns to tie Randy Moss (1998) for most TDs in that span with 17, and pass Bob Hayes (1966) and Billy Howton (1953) at 16 along the way.\nSports Top New York sports catches since 2000 No wonder he's hoping the Giants open up their passing attack against the league's top rush defense but worst pass defense.\n\"You want to see the ball thrown in the air and you want to be able to make plays,'' Beckham said. \"If he throws 100 passes, we want to complete 100 of them. And with that being said I hope we do throw 100 passes. If they're stopping the run, all right, we're throwing the ball all game. I definitely wouldn't mind it.''\nSomeone else might. Tom Coughlin spoke earlier in the week about the need to keep pounding with the ground game even when it isn't working against a tough opponent like the Bills. He wants balance, not ballistics.\nBeckham knows the Giants will run at least a few times. And he also knows that gaining any yards against the Bills will be difficult.\n\"You spread it around and you become unpredictable,'' he said. \"You don't know whether it's a pass, a run, or whatever the case may be. You just want to keep them on their toes. They are a very good defense.''\nGiants OBJ encourages teammates to have fun Maybe, he suggested (and contrary to the numbers), the best in the NFL.\n\"I watched the Miami game [Sunday] and I'm looking forward to the opportunity,'' he said. \"You always want to play against the best, and from what I've seen so far this year, that team has some of the best talent on defense.''\nBeckham will get some inside intel on that game from his former LSU teammate, Dolphins receiver Jarvis Landry. The close friends have spoken this week and could do so several more times before the game.\n\"He's told me some good things about them, what to look for and who to look out for,'' Beckham said.\nBeckham will be without another confidant, though, as Victor Cruz will miss another week after his expected return this Sunday was derailed.\n\"You wish that you could have him out there,'' Beckham said. \"At the end of the day, you want Vic to be healthy. If he's not able to play, he's not able to play. There's nothing more to it.''\nSpoken like a veteran. Or at least a player whose rookie year is almost complete.\nSubscribe to Newsdayâ€™s sports newsletter for stories, photos and videos about your favorite New York teams plus national sports news and events.", "external_links": ["http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer", "http://static.eplayer.performgroup.com/flash/js/performgroup.js", "http://images.eplayer.performgroup.com/namedImage/12637/install_flash.gif", "http://static.eplayer.performgroup.com/flash/js/swfobject.js"], "published": "2015-10-02T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:40:19.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
