(AP) - Mississippi-based regional bank Renasant Corp. will acquire Georgia-based KeyWorth Bank for $59 million in stock.\nThe banks announced the merger Tuesday, just after Tupelo-based Renasant announced its quarterly earnings.\nThe merger will bulk up the presence of Renasant, based in Tupelo, in Atlanta's affluent northern suburbs. Renasant has been gobbling up other banks, acquiring seven in the last 11 years.\nKeyWorth, based in Johns Creek, Georgia, has $389 million in assets. Renasant says the merger would give it $8.2 billion in assets and 175 offices in Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia and Florida.\nThe banks say they hope to complete the merger before March, pending approval by KeyWorth shareholders and regulators. Two top KeyWorth managers are supposed to remain.\nRenasant says the acquisition would boost profits immediately.\nThis story has been corrected to show that KeyWorth is based in Johns Creek, Georgia, not Heritage.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
