We had some good fortune for the first goal and we took advantage of it. It’s the first good weekend the fans have had this season. \n“It’s a big victory and we can all look forward to next week. Hopefully this is the start of us getting out of trouble.” \nAllardyce sympathized with Newcastle, whom he managed in 2007-8, over the red card, suggesting: “I think a penalty’s enough (punishment)”. \nHis opposite number Steve McClaren, however, felt the penalty was “absolutely ridiculous”. \n“We were the better side by a distance,” McClaren said. “We controlled it, created chances and never looked like giving away anything at the back. Even with 10 men in the second half we still controlled it. The defining moments were two refereeing decisions he got wrong.” \nOn Saturday, bitter rivals Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho had wildly contrasting afternoons as Arsenal went top of the league and champion Chelsea lost again with its manager being sent off. \nWenger, once dubbed “a specialist in failure” by the Chelsea boss, punched the air in delight as Arsenal beat Everton 2-1 at a rain-lashed Emirates Stadium. \nMourinho, however, failed to show up at his post-match news conference after the Stamford Bridge club slumped to sixth from bottom following a 1-2 defeat at West Ham United. \nOn another bleak day for Chelsea it finished with 10 men after having Serbia midfielder Nemanja Matic sent off. The mood of the visitors was not helped at a wet Upton Park when Cesc Fabregas had a first-half goal harshly disallowed for offside. \nArsenal won its fourth successive league match after headers from Olivier Giroud and Laurent Koscielny in a three-minute spell in the first half helped it go top for the first time since February 2014. It has 22 points from 10 games and will stay at the summit until at least yesterday when Manchester City, second on 21, was playing Manchester United, fourth on 19, at Old Trafford.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T18:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:13:10.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
