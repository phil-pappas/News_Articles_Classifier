GLENN GUILBEAU COLUMN, Gannett Louisiana 7:55 p.m. CDT October 16, 2015 LSU head coach Les Miles reacts during the second half of an NCAA college football game against South Carolina in Baton Rouge, La., Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015.

Thank you, SEC office for keeping LSU and Florida as West-East permanent opponents and not yielding to the silly scheduling inequity argument. By nature, schedules balance out. Florida has had strong and weak periods while playing LSU just as Tennessee has had while playing Alabama. \nMore importantly, LSU-Florida makes geographic, historical and cultural sense and always has, even before divisional play started in 1992. This is because LSU and Florida played every season from 1971 through 1991 and every season from 1953 through 1967. With Florida as LSU’s closest SEC East neighbor, and practically a border state, it was a no-brainer to have the two be permanent foes when the SEC went to 12 teams in 1992. Since the league went to 14 teams in 2012, permanent opponents no longer makes as sharp sense. But if you have to have one permanent opponent from the other division, LSU and Florida should play every year. \nIf not, what would we be doing Saturday night? LSU would probably be hosting an unranked SEC East team like Georgia or Kentucky or Missouri or Vanderbilt or Tennessee. If LSU and Florida were not permanent opponents, what team would LSU have been playing in Tiger Stadium on Oct. 11, 1997, or on Oct. 6, 2007, or on Oct. 10, 2009? \nThe first two of those dates remain two of the greatest nights in LSU history. The Tigers toppled the No. 1, defending national champion Gators, 28-21, in 1997 for their first-ever victory over a No. 1 team. And No. 1 LSU beat No. 9 Florida, 28-24, in an instant classic in the 2007 game that featured Florida quarterback Tim Tebow, who won the Heisman the following December, and LSU defensive tackle Glenn Dorsey, who won the Outland, Nagurski, Lombardi and Lott awards after the season. Yeah, LSU and Florida should not play every year. \nAll three of the above meetings of East and West involved a No. 1 team — Florida twice and LSU once. All three were pairings of ranked teams with the last two top-10 pairings and the last one a top-four pairing. That top four pairing in 2009 with No. 4 LSU and No. 1 Florida marked the two highest ranked teams to meet in Tiger Stadium since — yes — No. 1 LSU beat No. 3 Ole Miss, 7-3, 50 years before on Halloween Night on Billy Cannon’s 89-yard punt return. There has not been a higher ranked twosome in Tiger Stadium since 2009. \nNo. 6 LSU (5-0, 3-0 SEC) and No. 8 Florida (6-0, 4-0) meet at 6 p.m. Saturday on ESPN, marking the sixth time since 2006 that this is a top 10 pairing. Yeah, these two don’t need to play every year. No other LSU series boasts that many nationally significant games over that span. No, not even LSU-Alabama. Could you imagine if they considered not letting LSU and Bama play every year? \nLSU’s players can’t fathom not playing Florida. \n“Ever since I was young, there was always the hype behind the LSU-Florida game,” junior offensive tackle Jerald Hawkins said. “And it’s holding up to its name.” \nThey consider it as near to Alabama as possible. \n“Uh, I mean that other team is a different story,” said LSU safety Rickey Jefferson, whose interception and 23-yard return with 24 seconds left set up the game-winning field goal to beat Florida, 30-27, last year. “But this one is right there. It’s a little tension, you know. Just always felt that way about Florida. Even back when my brother (Jordan Jefferson) was playing, there just was always tension when LSU and Florida played. It’s just always been a rivalry, man. Just always look forward to playing in it. There’s an edge. I start to growling. It’s like that.” \nHere are five things to look for in what has proven to be the SEC’s most growling cross-division rivalry. \n1. LSU BACKFIELD: Without fullback John David Moore, who is out with a thigh injury, the Tigers face the best defense they have seen all season so far, and it could end up as the best or second best they see all season. The Gators are second in the SEC and 12th nationally against the run with 99.2 yards allowed a game, but they haven’t played tailback Leonard Fournette yet. He leads the nation with 204 yards a game and with 1,022 yards overall. \nMoore is a hugely effective blocker, but after he got hurt last week, LSU accidentally learned it could run quite effectively with Fournette as the lone back with a three-wide receiver spread. The absence of Moore, whom Fournette calls his “flashlight,” will likely hurt particularly in the dark corners of short yardage and will leave LSU with one less dominant option as backup fullbacks Bry’Kiethon Mouton and David Ducre are still learning. \n“He was a great help,” LSU left tackle Jerald Hawkins said of Moore. “If we don’t see something, he makes sure we see it. He always communicates with us and with the quarterback. He’s a great player.” \n2. FLORIDA DEFENSIVE BACKS VS. LSU RECEIVERS: The Gators have perhaps the best secondary in the SEC with junior cornerback Vernon Hargreaves III leading the way. LSU wide receivers Travin Dural and Malachi Dupre are each coming off solid games last week after suffering drops the previous week. “Those guys are really talented,” Dural said of Florida’s secondary. “We all know what they’re capable of. Hargreaves is a very smart player. You can tell he studies a lot of film because he knows the receivers he’s going against.” \n3. LSU DEFENSIVE LINE VS. FLORIDA QUARTERBACK TREON HARRIS: After registering eight sacks in their first two games, LSU’s defensive line has dipped to just one in two of its last three games. \nThe Gators may have lost freshman starting quarterback Will Grier to a suspension, but sophomore Treon Harris is mobile and talented. He also started six games last season and the opener this year. He will be ready. He is also the best of the four backup quarterbacks who will have started against LSU this season because of injuries or, in this case, a suspension to a previous starter. And the three previous ones did well. \n4 . FLORIDA HEAD COACH JIM MCELWAIN VS. LSU DEFENSIVE COORDINATOR KEVIN STEELE: This will be the biggest challenge of the season so far for Steele, who has had mixed results so far. His secondary has looked confused late in games and has allowed a flurry of touchdowns to green quarterbacks on bad teams. McElwain, who was Alabama’s offensive coordinator in 2008 when Steele was linebackers coach, is a very sharp offensive mind who has done well with the terrible offense he inherited from previous head coach Will Muschamp. Steele will need to be on his game because McElwain will be. \n5. No. 9 ALABAMA AT No. 10 TEXAS A&M: Should the Aggies (5-0, 2-0) defeat Alabama (5-1, 2-1) in the 2:30 p.m. game on CBS, the Crimson Tide could be out of the SEC West race with two West losses just as the Tigers are working up a sweat in the first quarter. \nPREDICTION: Fournette struggles early against the Gators but wears them down as LSU quarterback Brandon Harris completes several crucial passes after an early interception return for a touchdown.
