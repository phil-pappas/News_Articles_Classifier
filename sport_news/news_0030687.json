Arizona Athletics Oct 24, 2015 at 7:01p ET 0Shares \nTUCSON, Ariz. -- Arizona freshman Ray Smith, a key part of coach Sean Miller's latest recruiting class, will not play this season after tearing his right ACL in practice. \nA 6-foot-8 small forward from Las Vegas, Smith was expected to play a significant role with the Wildcats , along with fellow freshman Allonzo Trier. \n\"Ray Smith is one of the most talented young players that has ever entered our program. The news of his injury is incredibly disappointing on several levels. However, the togetherness of our program is one of our strengths,\" Arizona coach Sean Miller said in a statement. \n\"His journey in getting to the top of the mountain might be different, but I have tremendous belief that he will get there with this type of support, his amazing determination to succeed and the love of the game of basketball that he possesses.\" \nSmith was rated as one of the nation's top small forwards out of high school despite missing his senior season with a torn left ACL. \nArizona lost four starters from last season's Elite Eight team, but was still picked to win the Pac-12 in a preseason media poll. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:21:57.363+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
