We take very seriously the responsibility of balancing exciting finishes and safety. We’re confident that this is a positive direction for both.”\nSeveral drivers were left shaken by Dillon's Daytona crash, in which both he and fans in the stands emerged without any serious injuries.\nRace winner Dale Earnhardt Jr. said he was near tears after watching the wreck in his rear-view mirror, Jimmie Johnson said he was shocked Dillon survived the crash and Ryan Newman lashed out by saying NASCAR \"got what they wanted\" with a spectacular wreck.\nEarnhardt Jr. immediately applauded the move Tuesday on Twitter, saying ''In favor of this. Thought three attempts were excessive and gimmicky.\"\nAnd Talladega is expected to take the intensity up to another level entirely. This is an elimination race for Round 2 of the Chase for the Sprint Cup, and only one driver -- Joey Logano -- is locked into the third round. That means 11 drivers will be fighting for the remaining seven spots, and the cutoff may very well come down to the final lap.\nAs the possibility of a GWC reduction became apparent in recent weeks, drivers seemed to welcome the change. Fewer GWC attempts mean less opportunity for a harrowing crash coming to the finish, though it also means the race could end under caution -- which NASCAR typically tries to avoid.\n\"I think it's a good idea just based on past history of what would you have seen on green‑white‑checkereds as far as really just destroying race cars,\" Martin Truex Jr. said Tuesday. \"I think the chances when you go to Talladega of bringing a car home are slim. If you have green‑white‑checkereds there, the chance of not bringing a car home goes up pretty dramatically.\"\nDuring a media event earlier this month, Brad Keselowski said the idea of reducing GWC attempts was \"not a bad thing.\"\n\"(If) it ends under yellow, it kind of feels a little uncomfortable,\" he said. \"You give another crack at it and see if you can’t finish it off for the fans and if it doesn’t come together, well, we tried. I would feel pretty good about that if I was a fan, and as a team owner I would feel pretty good about that too.”\nNASCAR indicated the reduction to one GWC attempt is only for Talladega at this time, although the change will be monitored this weekend for whether it would be effective at restrictor plate tracks in 2016.\nFollow Gluck on Twitter @jeff_gluck\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/jeff_gluck", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:48:17.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
