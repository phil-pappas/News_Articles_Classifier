Kyle Gibbs told The Associated Press that three people were killed and 22 were injured in the crash Saturday morning. \nThe driver has been arrested on a charge of driving under the influence. Gibbs said the woman's sedan crashed into the motorcycle of an officer who was working security at the route, then into the crowd of people. \nDave Kapple of Houston told the Stillwater News Press that he and his son were about 10 feet away when they saw the vehicle barreling into the crowd. \n\"We heard somebody scream, 'Look out!' (The driver) plowed through a police motorcycle, and then a crowd of people,\" Kapple said. \"People were flying everywhere.\" \nKonda Walker, from Anchorage, Alaska, was attending the festivities ahead of the homecoming game between Oklahoma State and Kansas. \n\"At first we thought it was part of the show,\" Walker told the News Press. \"People were flying 30 feet into the air like rag dolls.\" \nKansas University's marching band did make the trip to Stillwater for today's game, but the KU band was not participating in the homecoming parade, which started early Saturday morning, KU officials in Stillwater said this afternoon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:54:55.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
