Daniel Murphy has been providing them all postseason. \nHarvey pitched the game he’s been pining for, Murphy took his latest star turn and the New York Mets beat the Chicago Cubs 4-2 Saturday night in their NL Championship Series opener. \nAfter eliminating rival St. Louis and streaking into New York with 12 wins in 13 games, the power-hitting Cubs and their young sluggers were stopped cold on a chilly night at Citi Field. Trying to end a championship drought that dates to 1908, they remained four wins from capturing their first pennant in seven decades. \nMeanwhile, the Mets have a mind to make some history of their own — the kind that would break the Cubs’ hearts one more tormenting time. \nGame 2 in the best-of-seven set is tonight, with Chicago ace Jake Arrieta facing rookie Noah Syndergaard. \nLeft fielder Yoenis Cespedes cut down a runner at the plate, and Curtis Granderson had two RBI for New York. Travis d’Arnaud homered off the giant Mets apple in straightaway center field. \nHarvey struck out nine and worked into the eighth for the first time in more than two months — brushing aside all that late-season hoopla about his innings limit as his 2015 total reached 202. \nJeurys Familia got four outs for his third playoff save. \nNew York is looking to advance to the World Series for the first time in 15 years, the longest absence in franchise history but one the Cubs and all their pained, loyal followers certainly scoff at. \nMurphy connected off losing pitcher Jon Lester for his fourth homer of the playoffs and made a diving play at second base for the final out. \nKyle Schwarber was the only one of those rookie boppers who showed off his prodigious power for the Cubs, hitting a mammoth homer that chased Harvey with two outs in the eighth and pulled Chicago to 4-2. \nStarlin Castro had an RBI double in the fifth but was thrown out at the plate by Cespedes on Javier Baez’s single. \nMurphy, who set a career high this season with 14 homers, launched another one into the second deck in right field for his fourth of the postseason. By taking Clayton Kershaw (twice), Zack Greinke and Lester deep, the 2014 All-Star has tagged $517 million worth of pitchers in these playoffs. \nGranderson’s soft RBI single on an 0-2 pitch from Lester put the Mets up 2-1 in the fifth, and d’Arnaud hit a 431-foot drive to center in the sixth. Juan Lagares stole third against Lester in the seventh and scored on Granderson’s sacrifice fly. \nROYALS 6, BLUE JAYS 3 \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — Ryan Goins saw the lazy fly leave Ben Zobrist’s bat and began to give chase from second base. Jose Bautista saw the same thing from right field and sprinted after the ball. \nNeither of the Blue Jays wound up catching it. \nA seemingly sure out turned into a hit when the ball fell in, beginning Kansas City’s five-run rally against David Price in the seventh inning Saturday. The Royals rolled the rest of the way to a 6-3 victory over Toronto and a 2-0 lead in the AL Championship Series. \nLuke Hochevar wiggled out of a jam to keep Kansas City in the game, and Danny Duffy and Kelvin Herrera got the ball to closer Wade Davis, who had to survive a shaky ninth to preserve the win. \nDavis gave up a leadoff single and walked pinch-hitter Cliff Pennington, but bounced back to strike out leadoff man Ben Revere and MVP candidate Josh Donaldson. Jose Bautista then flied out to right to give Davis his third postseason save and the Royals another postseason comeback win. \nThe Royals proceeded to string together four singles and a double in their go-ahead inning, getting run-producing hits from Gordon, Eric Hosmer, Mike Moustakas and Alex Rios, along with an RBI groundout from Kendrys Morales. \nIt was a monumental collapse for Price, who had at one point recorded 18 straight outs. He fell to 0-7 in seven postseason starts, including a loss to Texas in their AL Division Series. \nMeanwhile, the reigning AL champs have won nine straight ALCS games dating to their memorable seven-game series against Toronto in 1985 — the year they won their only World Series. The record is 10 straight wins set by Baltimore in the 1970s and ’80s. \nNow, the Blue Jays head home for Game 3 on Monday night in dire trouble. All but three of the previous 25 teams to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven era have won the series — though Toronto did rally from the same hole to beat the Rangers in five games in the division round. \nFor most of the afternoon, the Blue Jays were exactly where they wanted to be. \nGoins drove in a run off Ventura in the third, snapping an 18-inning scoreless streak by Royals pitchers. Edwin Encarnacion and Troy Tulowitzki added to the lead in the sixth. \nAnd the way Price was carving up the lineup, a 3-0 advantage looked to be enough.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T10:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:56:20.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
