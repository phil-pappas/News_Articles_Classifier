They've got a good football team. We knew that coming in. It was a hard fought game. Both sides had their moments. I'm really proud of our team to take a strong lead in the first half and go in at halftime with a pretty good lead playing well. I'm not happy coming out at halftime, but that's part of the game. We keep playing. West Virginia had their spots there, but I'm really proud of our guys to then take control of it after that making big plays offensively and defensively. To take back control of the game and seal it; I like the character of the guys and the way they fought and competed...\n\"The way they come at you defensively, they're going to get their plays, pressure you, and they're going to chunk up some run game, but then you've got to get your big plays on them. We did. That was a part of it [a win]. When you play that way you are also susceptible to some of the passing game and you can break a run, which Joe [Mixon] did on occasion after he got some space. I thought our guys handled it, for the most part, pretty well.\n\"Defensively, I thought also, we were really good. The turnovers, the pressure, the sacks, defending the pass was outstanding. One drive we had 45 yards in penalties. That's the one disappointment of the day. Hands to the face and some of the foolish penalties we had we've got to correct. But played really aggressive and physical, covered well [and] defended the run well. Really, all of it was I was pleased with.\"\nOn creating turnovers:\n\"I believe the law of averages usually works your way. We're not doing anything differently that other people are doing. We've had the ball out three or four times in the previous games and weren't able to pick it up. Well we picked them up today and advanced them. We stepped in front of some balls and guys were in good positions to make some interceptions. It was a positive part of the day from the second half for sure.\"\nOn how difficult it is in a game where there are a lot of penalties:\n\"Really difficult. And I'm not complaining. We'll see it on tape. Usually a hands to the face is pretty easy to see. We gotta clean it up. They had a lot on their end as well. We'll see it and evaluate it. From what I understand, we earned them. We've got to learn to play smarter.\"\nOn if facing the Texas Longhorns this week will be any different given their rough start:\n\"No. We know better than that. We're the ones that still have to go play. More than anything it's about us improving. We're only four games into it and got a big stretch coming. Texas is the first one. We gotta make improvement. That's what our emphasis will be.\"\nOn how he's characterize the running game:\n\"Effective. Needs to continue to grow and improve. I believe it will.\"\nOklahoma 44, West Virginia 24: Complete coverage\nBox score\nDiscuss this and the Big 12 with Chuck Carlton on Thursday; ask questions now.\nClick here to visit the Oklahoma Sooners page\nFive thoughts: Sooners' defense comes up big; where was running game?\nPhotos: Undefeated Oklahoma tunes up for Texas by leaving West Virginia in wake\nOklahoma forces five turnovers in win over West Virginia\nCarlton: Unbeaten Oklahoma rolls into Cotton Bowl, as Texas staggers along\nOklahoma quotable: Bob Stoops on Sooners creating turnovers, facing Longhorns\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["http://d-news.co/SYNiW", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/oklahoma-sooners", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegephotos/2015/10/03/photos-undefeated-oklahoma-tunes-texas-leaving-west-virginia-wake", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/texas-rangers/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/carlton-unbeaten-oklahoma-rolls-cotton-bowl-astexas-staggers-along", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/oklahoma-forces-five-turnovers-win-west-virginia", "https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/five-thoughts-oklahoma-sooners-defense-comes-big-win-west-virginia-running-game", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/04/oklahoma-quotable-bob-stoops-sooners-creating-turnovers-facing-texas-longhorns-next-week", "http://dallasnews.stats.com/cfb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=201510030024&home=24&vis=17&final=true"], "published": "2015-10-04T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:46:35.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
