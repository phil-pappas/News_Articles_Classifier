From a stirring version of \"Taps\" played by a solo trumpeter, to five live songs from the Stanford band, to Rod Stewart's \"Forever Young\" and Barbara Streisand's \"Memories,\" a pair of tunes that accompanied a slideshow in tribute to Laird. \nArguably Stanford's No. 1 sports fan, Jack Laird passed away earlier this month at the age of 98. Laird, class of 1940 at Stanford, dedicated most of his life to the athletic department, founding the \"Buck Club \"and the \"Starting 11,\" two fundraising entities. \nThe memorial drew around 50 of Laird's friends and relatives, including former Stanford Athletic Director Ted Leland. \n\"My dad was an incredible dad and an incredible man,\" said Kathy Benn, Laird's daughter. \"He was one of the most positive people I knew. That contributed to his long life. He was passionate about Stanford. He wore red every day. He drove a little red sports car with 'Zap SC' on the license plate.\" \n\"Jack was a great guy,\" said Laird's son-in-law, Fred Benn. \"Towards the end, when he was in a wheelchair, I would have to leave half and hour early because everybody would stop him as we walked through Chuck Taylor Grove. He knew everybody and everybody knew him. Even at 95, he would remember names from 30 years ago.\" Advertisement \nLaird was born in Pennsylvania, then raised in Oregon. He spurned two scholarships to play basketball at Stanford where he had to pay his own tuition. Laird played three years with Stanford legend Hank Luisetti, who guided the then Indians to the NCAA title in 1942. \nLaird also boxed, keeping in tip-top shape the rest of his life. Laird was a Lieutenant Colonel in the Air Force, flying before World War II up through Vietnam as part of the Air Force reserves. \n\"Jack wasn't exactly in the Korean conflict because he was a contract pilot flying troops from the United States to Japan,\" Fred Benn said. \nLaird, who flew commercially for Pan-Am, turned to, literally, climbing great heights. When he was in his '60s, Laird climbed Base Camp 7 of Mt. Everest without oxygen. At the age of 70, Laird took on Mt. Kilimanjaro. To train for his adventurous climbs, Laird ran the stairs in Stanford Stadium. \n\"He climbed Mt. Hood and Mt. Helen's before it exploded,\" Benn said. \nWhen Laird retired from flying, he volunteered his time at Stanford as a fundraiser. Laird formed the Starting 11 when Jack Elway was head coach of the Cardinal from 1984 to 1988. Eileen Gall, former Director of Stewardship and Events at Stanford, worked with Laird for four years. \n\"Jack had a great spirit for Stanford,\" said Gall, no relation to former Stanford star baseball player John Gall. \"He loved Stanford athletics. We worked in development together and he was good at it. Everybody knew Jack.\" \nLaird played basketball at lunch with the Stanford coaches until he was 86. What stopped Laird was he had both knees and a hip replaced. \nLaird was at 440 consecutive football games, a gift bestowed him by the athletic department upon his retirement. Laird could fly on the team plane every place they went, which he did until he was 95. \nLaird was there in spirit when the Stanford band gathered outside of Jimmy V's on Campus Drive, striking up \"Come Join the Band\" and \"All Right Now.\" \nAnd when an Air Force contingent went through the ceremonial folding of the American flag, then presented it to Laird's daughter, Kathy, there wasn't a dry eye in the house. \nAfter it was all over, a cohort of Laird's shouted, \"Zap SC.\" \nNot long after Laird went on to his greater glory, the Cardinal did just that, upsetting then No. 6 USC 41-31 in the Los Angeles Coliseum on Sept. 19. Somewhere up there, Laird was sporting his natural smile. \nEmail John Reid at jreid@dailynewsgroup.com ; follow him at twitter.com/dailynewsjohn .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T21:34:38.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
