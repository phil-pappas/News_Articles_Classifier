CHARLES – It was an emotionally charged Thursday afternoon at the St. Charles North natatorium. \nThe North girls swimming team squared off against crosstown rival St. Charles East on senior night. Also, the meet honored the For Scout Foundation, a charitable organization formed in memory of Scout Cantrell, a 9-year old swimmer who died last year from complications of an asthma attack. \nThe North Stars swimmers remained focused on the task at hand and won, 101-85. \n“I really like the performance of the kids from top to bottom,” North coach Rob Rooney said. “It was obviously a very emotional meet. I’m proud that the team is learning how to focus on meets. That’s extremely big, especially when you trying to put together teams for your championship meets.” \n“It was a tough loss,” East coach Joe Cabel said. “We battled well with them, but they’re just stronger across the board.” \nThe Saints opened and closed the meet with wins, winning the starting event, the 200-yard medley relay (1:47.52) and final race, the 400 freestyle relay (3:38.96). \n“We were good at the beginning and at the very end,” Cabel said. “We need to firm up the middle.” \nNorth dominated in between, winning eight of the remaining 10 events. North’s Guyett sisters figured in five of the events. Senior Monica Guyett won the 200 free (1:53.9), the 500 free (5:06.23) and swam the final leg of the 200 free relay. Guyett, Jill Waslawski, Grace Samuelson and Samantha Sauer took top honors in the event with a time of 1:37.52. \n“I think it’s always fun swimming against East,” Guyett said. “A lot of the girls know each other from club swimming, so it’s a fun competition.” \nSophomore Audrey Guyett came in first in the 100 backstroke (56.61) and the 200 IM (2:06.40).Sauer also won two races for the North Stars – the 50 free (24.44) and the 100 free (53.59). \nIsabel Herb, competing in the event for the first time, won the 100 butterfly (58.15) for the Saints. Kayla Jones was East’s other individual winner. The junior won the 100 breaststroke in 1:07.42. \n“We knew that North was strong coming in,” Herb said. “I thought our girls did amazing with the circumstances that we were under.” \nThe loudest cheers of the night happened after the meet when Rooney and Cabel presented the Cantrell family a check for $5,640 for their foundation. Cabel also announced that East’s swimming team would donate another $1,000. Katie Cantrell, a freshman, is on the North swim team. \n“The Cantrell family lost a young girl a year ago who was a member of our swimming community and both sides down here are big into supporting each other with things of that nature,” Rooney said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:12:52.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
