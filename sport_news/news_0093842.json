The luck of the draw, where an airline could get a passenger pre-approved, has ended, so travelers need to take it upon themselves to initiate the process.\nAbout 1.5 million Americans have done so, according to Nico Melendez, TSA regional public affairs manager.\nWhy set up pre-check? It can save frequent travelers time and hassle.\nThe larger U.S. airports have special security lines for passengers who have pre-check noted on their boarding passes. The lines are shorter and move more quickly because pre-approved passengers do not need to take off shoes, remove laptops from cases, place small amounts of liquids in trays, or take off belts or outer clothing.\nTo qualify for pre-check, air travelers must pre-enroll on the TSA website, provide basic information and proof of U.S. citizenship. They will be finger printed and undergo a background check. If they pass, they must pay $85 to be in pre-check for five years.\nIt's also possible to qualify for pre-check by going through one of three traveler verification programs runs by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Most attractive of the three to Oregonians, who don't have an international border to contend with on a regular basis, is \"global entry,\" which for $100 will give those pre-approved expedited customs clearance, as well as TSA pre-check.\nBe sure to submit your pre-check number when purchasing an air ticket. Apply for pre-check at tsa.gov , or global entry at cbp.gov .\n-- Terry Richard\ntrichard@oregonian.com\n503-221-8222; @trichardpdx", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:24:13.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
