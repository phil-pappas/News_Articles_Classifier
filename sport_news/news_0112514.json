We've got three or four visiting the doctor (Saturday) morning.\"\nRegion 2-2A Showdown: Much also rides on Friday night's showdown featuring Grace Christian Academy at Austin-East.\nBoth teams are coming off big victories.\nThe Roadrunners (7-2, 4-1 Region 2-2A) blitzed Sweetwater 50-28 on Friday night and Grace Christian (5-4, 5-0) defeated Tellico Plains, 25-7.\nAustin-East got another strong outing from Darius Harper, a rising star at quarterback.\nThe strong-armed 6-foot-3, 195-pound junior completed 15 of 22 passes for 250 yards and three touchdowns. He also ran for two scores.\n\"He's coming into his own,\" Austin-East coach Jeff Phillips said. \"No disrespect to any of the other quarterbacks in the city, but I think he's the best quarterback in the city.\"\nHarper spread the wealth around among his receivers.\nKajuan Hale-Ligon hauled in eight passes for 110 yards, caught a 35-yard TD pass and returned a punt 66 yards for a score.\nWide receiver Kashif Warren Jr. (five catches, 119 yards) had TD grabs of 60 and 9 yards.\nDefensive end Jimmy Rowans returned a fumble 54 yards for six points.\nKeanu Prigmore and Shannon Cozart recorded eight tackles apiece. Cozart had four tackles for loss.\nThe Roadrunners finish second in the region with a win over Grace Christian on Friday night. A loss will drop them to third.\nThe Rams will win the region outright with a victory over Austin-East.\n\"This is the game that the coaches and myself pegged when we got the new regions and drew Grace as the last game,\" Phillips said. \"It feels good for our team to be playing in a meaningful game this time of the season.\"\nThe Roadrunners missed the playoffs in 2014 after going 2-8.\nMomentum Builder: It wasn't a region game, but Morristown East's 24-21 victory over Anderson County on Friday night gives the Hurricanes a boost heading into this week's showdown at Cocke County for the final playoff berth in Region 1-5A.\n\"It was a big game for us,\" Morristown East coach Dewayne Wells said. \"With an opportunity to play that last game to get in the playoffs, we wanted to make sure we went in with some confidence.\"\nThe Mavericks (3-6) took a 14-7 lead at the half against the Hurricanes (2-7), who scored 17 unanswered points to take command.\nSenior running back Bryson Stephens scored a pair of touchdowns for Morristown East, and Jon Koogler booted a 29-yard field goal in the third quarter for the Hurricanes.\nTeed Up: Oak Ridge junior receiver Tee Higgins turned in a highlight-reel performance in a 62-6 win over Webb.\nThe Tennessee commitment had touchdown grabs of 31, 19 and 10 yards in the second quarter.\nHe finished with five catches for 77 yards and returned two punts for 76 yards as the Wildcats improved to 8-1.\n\"He continues to improve in all facets of the game,\" Wildcats coach Joe Gaddis said.\nHiggins took over punt-return duties midseason and has proven dynamic in the return game.\nAfter nearly breaking his first two punt returns for touchdowns, Webb opted to punt the ball out of bounds the rest of the way.\n\"Tee has turned into a huge weapon for us there,\" Gaddis said.\nThe 6-4, 184-pound Higgins has 41 receptions for 770 yards and 13 touchdowns this season.\nHe's closing on Oak Ridge single-season records for most touchdown receptions (16) and receiving yards (886), set by Antoine Thrift in 1991 in 15 games.\nOak Ridge hosts Campbell County on Friday night with the winner claiming second place in Region 3-5A and home-field advantage for the first round of the playoffs.\nThe loser finishes third and will go on the road in the first round.\nMike Blackerby is a freelance contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:25:34.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
