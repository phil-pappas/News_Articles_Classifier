And Sessegnon and McClean - McClean was outstanding today. \n“His energy levels and quality on the ball was first-class. He’s got better and better as we go along. I was really pleased for him.\" \nAlbion grew into the game, after weathering a green and yellow storm in the first 20 minutes. \nThey had the best chance of the first-half just before the break, when Craig Dawson somehow managed to bounce a header off the ground and up over the bar from four yards out. \nPulis, who praised the Norfolk crowd, said: \"First quarter of an hour, I thought Norwich were very good. \n\"The support they’ve got and received was absolutely first-class, they were sucking the ball in at one end. \n\"We defended well. Boaz made a really good save, but as the game went on we got a grip of it. We were really disappointed at half-time not to come in with a goal. \n“Dawson’s header and Salomon’s header as well. So we’ve had good chances.\" \nThe Canaries struggled to test Myhill in the second half, whereas Albion zipped the ball around in midfield and held out for yet another clean sheet. \nPulis beamed: “The quality of our play going forward was very good, at times. I think we deserved to win. More on this story:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:52:38.948+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
