They needed a big win and an equally massive New England loss in order to close an eight-goal gap in goal differential and sneak into the playoffs. \nTheir odds sat at just 0.1 percent entering the night. That minuscule chance dropped even lower just a few minutes into the night. \nThe Revolution scored two minutes into an eventual 3-1 win over New York City FC, setting off a path that would lead to Orlando City (12-14-8, 44 pts.) finishing comfortably in seventh place in the Eastern Conference, three points below the all-important red playoff cut line. (Paul Tenorio) \nDespite the loss – Orlando City’s first since Sept. 5 – the Lions finished with 12 wins, tied for most by an expansion team since 1998. Its 44 points ranks second in that same timeframe. \nFor an expansion team that lost one of its best starters, Kevin Molino, for most of the season due to a torn ACL and saw another star, Brek Shea, miss time because of a sports hernia, Orlando City found a way to stretch its playoff hopes until the final day of the season. \nThey came out trying to make the impossible happen, and were left susceptible at times on Sunday as they pushed forward looking for goals. With Shea and Luke Boden drifting up the field and wingers Carlos Rivas and Adrian Winter staying high, Philadelphia had room on the counter attack. \nOrlando City never looked too dangerous against the Union (10-17-7, 37 pts.), racking up more yellow cards (6) than shots on goal (4). \nThe Union nearly took the lead twice in the first 20 minutes, with C.J. Sapong’s 19th minute shot rattling the crossbar, and then finally broke through in the 41st minute when Sebastien Le Toux calmly scored on a penalty kick. \nLe Toux earned the penalty when he was tripped in the box by Cristian Higuita on what looked like a harmless cross that sailed over the Philadelphia winger’s head. Le Toux stepped forward and buried the kick past Ford into the upper right corner. \nOrlando City had a few decent chances on the other end, but very little that truly threatened goalkeeper Andre Blake outside of Winter’s 36th minute offering that was kick-saved away. Rivas had a good look at goal in the 61st minute, but he hit his shot right at Blake. \nThe night got worse for Orlando City late in the second half when Higuita was shown a red card in the 86th minute for what was ruled to be a slap on Union midfielder Tranquilo Barnetta. That one-game suspension will carry over to the 2016 season opener. \nThe MLS playoffs start this week, but now Orlando City will move forward into its offseason plans. The goal now will be to add pieces that improve the core of a roster that fell just shy of the club’s postseason goals in its expansion year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T01:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:36:25.532+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
