The Browns' quarterback is in no mood to hear them after an overtime loss. Comment Posted Oct. 18, 2015 at 6:20 PM CLEVELAND • Browns have chances in OT loss to Broncos Robert Turbin, who played in the last two Super Bowls, urges his new quarterback not to be so super bummed. “What would I say to Josh McCown?” said Turbin, the ex-Seahawks running back whose first game as a Brown was a 26-23 overtime loss to Denver Sunday. “I’d say, ‘Look man. You can’t go out and throw for 400 yards every game. “This is professional football. You just played against the No. 1 defense in the league. You’re supposed to get hit. You’re supposed to be under duress, all right? “We’re not going to always make the greatest decision. But I would let him know at the end of the day that No. 27 has your back. We all got your back. “Let’s move on to the next week and get the W.” It was too soon for McCown. He couldn’t let go. It was 30 minutes after a chance to stun an unbeaten team and get to .500 had vanished. The 36-year-old quarterback sounded ready to heave last week’s AFC offensive player of the week plaque into Lake Erie. “Man,” McCown said, half talking to himself, “if I would have been better, we would have won the game.” McCown had showered and dressed but was nowhere close to washing a late interception out of his system. The Browns’ defense had protected a 23-all tie with a clutch three-and-out. A punt gave McCown the ball near midfield with more than a minute left in regulation. On a second-and-10, just inside Denver territory, he aimed a ball at Gary Barnidge under a heavy rush. Safety David Bruton made an easy pick. “I didn’t get enough on the ball,” McCown said. “It just makes me sick.” McCown threw an early pick-six that was neutralized in the fourth quarter when Browns linebacker Karlos Dansby made one of his own. Dansby’s play gave the Browns a momentary lead. In overtime, Denver got the ball first, but linebacker Barkevious Mingo quickly got it back on an interception. It was almost too good to be true. Not only had aging superstar Peyton Manning been stopped, the Browns got the ball on the Denver 39, needing one first down to be in reasonable field-goal range. Instead, McCown took sacks on second and third down, forcing a punt. Denver drove from the 12 to a winning field goal. For McCown, it was as if Manning’s last drive, covering 72 yards, didn’t exist. “The defense played lights out,” McCown said. “We didn’t hold up our end.” Page 2 of 2 - By “we,” it was clear in his tone, he meant “me.” The Browns fell to 2-4. McCown was acutely aware how much better 3-3 would have been. “There’s a lot going through my mind right now,” he said, “on what I could have done to help us win. “It’s a huge missed opportunity.” Manning vs. McCown produced some odd numbers. McCown went 20-of-39 for 213 yards, with four sacks, two touchdowns, two interceptions and a 63.3 rating. Manning went 26-of-48 for 290 yards, with no sacks, a touchdown, three interceptions and a 53.3 rating. McCown had no appetite for a question about engaging a legend in a thriller. “Not right now,” he said. “I’m disappointed in the way I played.” Reach Steve at 330-580-8347 or steve.doerschuk @cantonrep.com On Twitter: @sdoerschukREP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:52:18.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
