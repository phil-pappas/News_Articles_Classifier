All they need is a mobile device or internet. Two, it's flexible so you have the ability to transfer tickets with a couple of thumb clicks.\" \nTanke says with Flash Seats, fans will have three ways to enter the game; by downloading the Flash Seats app on a smart phone , by credit card or with a Minnesota driver's license. \nAs a smart phone, credit card or driver's license is scanned, it will automatically print out a \"seat locator,\" which looks more like a ticket for fans to enter the arena. The team will provide extra staffing at ticket entrances, knowing some fans may struggle to adapt to the new technology. \nSeats at Target Center (Photo: KARE) \n\"There is a learning curve. We have been going through this process with the Minnesota Lynx. They actually were the first team to go through it this past summer. It's change , and as people go through change, it's education,\" Tanke said. \nBut the Timberwolves say now the days of lost, stolen and fraudulent tickets will be eliminated, and with time, a swipe with the new ticketing system of the future will bring a slam dunk for fans. \n\"It's convenient, flexible and secure,\" Tanke said. \"Folks are loving it once they go through and see how convenient it Is for them.\" \nThe Timberwolves say Flash Seats eliminates long lines at will call and makes transferring tickets easier. \nBox office at Target Center (Photo: KARE) \nFans can still walk up to the box office and buy tickets with cash the day of games. Again, to help fans acclimate, extra help will be provided for people entering at the two preseason games before the Nov. 2 home opener. \nFlash Seats provides digital ticketing for entertainment venues and sports teams (NBA, NFL, NCAA) throughout the U.S., including the Cleveland Cavaliers, Houston Rockets and the NCAA Final Four, and was also successfully launched at Target Center for the 2015 Minnesota Lynx season, which tipped-off in May. \nDownload Flash Seats on iTunes here. 63 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.kare11.com/story/sports/nba/timberwolves/2015/10/05/timberwolves-launches-new-digital-ticket-system/73413208/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T04:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T11:05:12.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
