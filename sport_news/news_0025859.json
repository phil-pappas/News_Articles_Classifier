However, Armstead is totally focused on the Owls’ American Athletic Conference rival University of Central Florida. The Owls (5-0 overall, 2-0 league) will battle the Knights (0-6 overall, 0-2 league) on Saturday, Oct. 17, at Lincoln Financial Field (7:30 p.m. CBS SN). Despite UCF’s record, Armstead and his Temple teammates won’t take the Knights lightly, especially with a chance to crack the top 25 AP poll ranking. \n“It’s very important,” Armstead said. “We’ve been beaten two years in a row by UCF. So, we definitely don’t want to lose three times in a row. The coaches have made sure we have perfected everything. I think it’s going to be a good and exciting game. We have a lot of people mentioning (national rankings) to us, but that’s not something we’re worried about. We’re just focused on playing good football and executing.” \nArmstead played some good football in Temple’s 49-10 win over Tulane last week. The 5-foot-11, 205-pounder had six carries for 34 yards. Moreover, he scampered for two touchdowns in the Owls’ big victory. \n“It’s a very good opportunity to play college football as a true freshman,” Armstead said. “But none of those touchdowns would come without my line blocking for me. They do a terrific job. Our backfield is so dominant. We have Jahad (Thomas), David Hood and (Jager) Gardner. Every day we get better.” \nArmstead is from Bridgeton, New Jersey. He was a great running back at Millville High School in Millville, New Jersey. He gained 2,500 yards in his scholastic career. As a senior, Armstead rushed for 1,488 yards and scored 18 touchdowns to help his team post a 5-3 record. He holds the school single-game record with 337 rushing yards. \nArmstead has a lot of people from South Jersey who come to his Temple games at Lincoln Financial Field. He’s expecting a big crowd tomorrow. \n“I got a lot of people from Millville who bought season tickets,” Armstead said. “I see a lot of friends, family and relatives at the game with front row seats and everything. Every time I come out it’s nice to see them. I told them the game is 7:30 p.m. on Saturday night. I’m sure they’ll be there.” \ndhunt@phillytrib.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:34:58.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
