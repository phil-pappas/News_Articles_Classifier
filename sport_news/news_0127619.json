It really is been motivation during our preseason,&quot stated Salcedo, who won national championships as a player and assistant coach at UCLA but has come up short in two trips to the title game as a head coach.\n&quotWe know what it was like to get there. And we totally have a robust wish to get back there. It really is seriously enjoyable, the run. So you want to have that feeling once again.&quot\nThat run has gotten off to a slow get started with UCLA, which started the season ranked initial in the National Soccer Coaches Assn. of America poll but then lost three in a row to fall out of the major 25. The Bruins (two-3-) ended that skid with a 4-1 win over Cal Poly final Friday, but there remains considerably operate to be accomplished. according to senior midfielder Grady Howe.\n&quotWe’re playing with a chip on our shoulder due to the fact of what occurred last year,&quot Howe said. &quotWe know that if we reach our full possible, we have the opportunity to do what we did last year.\n&quotIt’s just a matter of drawing that out of ourselves and playing with that tiny chip on our shoulder from righting a wrong last year.&quot\nMotivation is not the only issue the Bruins are deep in. They also have a lot of talent, adding 14 freshmen &#8212 including what Best Drawer Soccer called the top recruiting class in the nation &#8212 to a team that contains nine returning starters. However, the two players that moved on left huge holes to fill: goalkeeper Earl Edwards Jr. gave up much less than a aim a game last season, though midfielder Leo Stolz won the Hermann Trophy, college soccer’s equivalent of football’s Heisman.\nEach are now in Significant League Soccer &#8212 Stolz with the New York Red Bulls, Edwards with Orlando City &#8212 providing the Bruins 18 players on existing MLS rosters, additional than any other college, according to the soccer internet site The18.com. UCLA has also sent 27 players to the U.S. men’s national group since 1990, almost 3 instances as several as any other school.\nUCLA has left a significantly less-indelible mark on the College Cup, having said that, with its 12-year title drought the school’s longest in three decades.\n&quotThe aim for any team is to win the national championship and we were a step short last year,&quot stated junior defender Michael Amick, a second-team All-American who is on the preseason Hermann Trophy watch list.\n&quotObviously to make it to the final is a huge deal,&quot continued Amick, who scored UCLA’s first goal in the win more than Cal Poly. &quotTo have that chance to play for a national championship is something that any team in the country would want. At the exact same time &#8230 when you happen to be that close to getting it all, you just want that small bit more.&quot\nAnd when you are that close to finding it all, you no longer sneak up on opponents. Which is why obtaining back to the final will be more difficult than making it there the 1st time.\n&quotIt’s certainly tougher with the expectations,&quot stated Grady, like Amick, a group captain. &quotWe have a target on our back. And each and every group offers us their best shot.\n&Quote: ach of these teams we play has the possible to beat us if we’re not prepared to go. We’ve knowledgeable that a couple of instances. So it is not about who we play. It’s about recognizing that we have a target on our back and we have to go out and give it our most effective shot every single day.&quot\nIn spite of the slow start, UCLA can climb back into the thick of the national championship image by winning the Pac-12 Conference title, which carries with it an automatic berth in November’s 48-team NCAA tournament field. Failing that, the Bruins could earn an at-large invitation if they play properly in the six games they have left against teams ranked in the prime nine of the NSCAA poll.\nEither way, the odds are in UCLA’s favor: In Salcedo’s 11 seasons as coach, the Bruins have never ever missed the NCAA tournament and have completed outdoors the top ten just when in the final five years.\nBut what they have not completed under Salcedo is win that final game.\n&quotPersonally it is been a enormous motivation to get back and to win it,&quot said Salcedo who, as a freshman, created the shot that gave UCLA the 1990 championship in a penalty-kick shootout. &quotFor us it is a process. Just about every year I have a superior feel for where the team is at. This year &#8230 I have a genuinely great understanding of the group.\n&quotWe can be a improved team than we have been last year.&quot\nAll it will take is a single much more win.\nAdhere to Kevin Baxter on Twitter @kbaxter11\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-soccer-baxter-20150920-story.html"], "published": "2015-09-20T06:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:05:02.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
