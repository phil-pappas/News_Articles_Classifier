(Jack Boland/Toronto Sun) Article Rock comes up short in NLL final \nRob Marshall spends his time between the Rock and a hard place. \nHe goes to school full time and works three days a week as a landscaper to pay the bills. That’s because his first passion, playing professional lacrosse, only pays a fraction of what other sports do. \nA 2013 study found the average salary for players was $19,700 — much lower than in other professional sports leagues. \nAfter finishing school and work, Marshall typically loads his equipment bag into the back of his truck and picks up his good friend and teammate Kasey Beirnes. \nThe pair head to the Air Canada Centre to play for the Toronto Rock. \nThe National Lacrosse League (NLL) offseason is still in full swing. With the world indoor lacrosse championships and the NLL draft having recently finished, attention has now shifted to the start of training camps in late November. \nFor Marshall and his teammates, it’s the first step towards raising a league-record seventh championship. \nMarshall, 30, has played for the Rock his entire nine-year career. He made the team in 2006 as a walk-on player. He’s now one of the most trusted defenders on the roster. \nWhen he first turned professional, he was working construction on top of playing for the Rock. \n“People like to think of lacrosse as a blue-collar sport. Every guy has a second job here. A lot of teachers, firefighters and policemen,” Marshall said. “At times, it’s tough to handle the two jobs, but to make lacrosse a full-time gig is tough.” \nJim Veltman knows about the trials of playing professional lacrosse. He, Marshall and Beirnes were teammates. \nThroughout his 16-year career, Veltman worked as a teacher. He also coached the school lacrosse team. Though the workload was difficult, he found a way to make things work. \n“At the start of my career, I was barely managing full-time work and the travel it took to play,” Veltman said. “By the end of my career, I switched to part-time work ... I made less money, but I spent more time with my family.” \nVeltman played his last season in 2008, the season Beirnes joined the Rock. Beirnes, of Elora, Ont., experienced a different kind of stress early in his career. Before coming to Toronto, he had stops in Columbus, Arizona and Minnesota. \nHe had to catch a plane every weekend. Some weekends, he wouldn’t be able to practise with his teammates before games. \n“The whole team would arrive at different times. When we arrived, we would sometimes try to piece together a late-night practice. But that didn’t always take place,” Beirnes said. \nHe would also worry about delays and whether he would even make the game if his plane was behind schedule. \nHe considers being a member of the Rock an honour and says it’s much easier to play at home in Ontario. \n“Waking up in your own bed really makes a big difference. And cruising down to Toronto and getting focused for the whole day is real nice.” \nIn 2011, both Beirnes and Marshall won the NLL championship with the Rock. It was the first championship for both players and a night they will remember forever. \nMarshall said all the work and travel was worth it when he finally got to hoist the trophy. \n“To win the NLL championship in Toronto is pretty amazing. To do it in front of family and friends, in front of 15,000 people screaming and shouting on the turf, confetti dropping from the ceiling,” Marshall said. “It gives me chills just thinking about it and it’s something I will never forget.” \nNLL SALARIES BASED ON THE 2013 CBA: Average salary: $19,700", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T22:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:43:56.181+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
