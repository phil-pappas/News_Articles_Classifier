Staff photo by Kathryn Ingall slideshow CANTON — Rome scored 28 points in the third quarter to beat Sequoyah 38-24 in a Region 7 (A) game, spoiling homecoming at Skip Pope Stadium and eliminating the Chiefs from postseason contention.With the win, Rome (5-3, 3-2) moved into a tie with Cass — its opponent next week — for the No. 3 seed in the subregion, and with it, the last opportunity to play a region crossover for a state playoff berth.Sequoyah (2-6, 2-3) can finish no better than fourth in its subregion, regardless of what happens next week at Woodland.“We just have to keep focusing on ourselves, getting better and trying to win some games,” Sequoyah coach James Teter said.The game was a defensive battle in the first half, with the only score coming when Austin Tracy found Brooks Morris for a 28-yard touchdown, taking advantage of a Rome muffed punt. The lead held until halftime, and the Chiefs took a 7-0 lead into the break.The second half was a different story. That was made clear on the first play from scrimmage, when Rome quarterback Knox Kadum found Jai’run Griffin on a short pass, and Griffin took it 80 yards for a score to tie the game.Big plays proved to be the winning recipe as the Wolves scored all 38 of their points in the second half, on just 19 offensive plays.“We didn’t make plays in the second half when we needed to,” Teter said. “We let them break off some big plays, and it definitely hurt us. Rome’s a good football team.”Knox and Griffin were the Wolves’ biggest stars, with Knox throwing for 250 yards and two touchdowns and Griffin catching six passes for 225 yards and a pair of scores. On the ground, Jamious Griffin and Jalynn Sykes both produced for Rome. Sykes carried the ball nine times for 107 yards and a touchdown, while Griffin recorded 73 yards and a score on 11 carries.While Sequoyah’s defense fell flat in the second half, the offense did its best to keep the game close.Tracy was 22-of-35 for 260, and he rushed for 32 yards, with 22 coming on a touchdown run in the third quarter. Coming off his best game of the season, Trey Mitchell struggled to find any room to run with 10 yards on 11 carries, but he was a valuable receiver, catching six passes for 73 yards.Brooks Morris also had a breakout game for the Chiefs with 67 total yards and two scores on just six carried.“I thought our offense looked pretty good,” Teter said. “Over the last couple of weeks, we’ve been looking a lot better on that side of the ball. We just need to find a way to put it all together.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:11:18.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
