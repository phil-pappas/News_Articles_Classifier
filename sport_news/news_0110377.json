She has placed in the top 10 or higher at every race that she has competed in this year. Including a 1st place win at Gladiator Rock N Run and a 3rd place win at Rugged Maniac. Also placing 4th in a 60k trail series called Captin Karls. She is very passionate about obstacle course racing and enjoying the time out on the courses competing alongside her sisters and daughter. \nChargualaf said, \"I started at the beginning of 2014 that was my first race and it was Warrior Dash I believe and I actually did it with a bunch of family members who are also Guamanian. That is when I really started to falling in love with the sport because of the community and how everybody is together. I grew up in the mainland but I feel like representing Guam will bring me closer to my heritage so I don't forget where I came from. Everybody automatically knows I'm not from here because of my last name Chargualaf and they always ask me if I'm Filipino or Hawaiian, I'm like no I'm from Guam.\" \nMelanie hopes to inspire people to follow their dreams no matter how hard they are to achieve. Chargualaf is currently on 2 pro teams. WOR and MOF. She is also an ambassador for cocogo, oraliv, HYLETE and honeystingers. Melanie has several races lined up for the rest of the year and hopes to come back home to compete in the near future. \nShe added, \"I got on to the pro team because when I started I wasn't thinking of becoming an elite or anything I just absolutely loved racing and I was really competitive. They just saw how much heart I had when I raced and they decided that they wanted to pick me up on their pro team. After that I started to run elite and I love it. It's a really great feeling because I have so many supporters and tons of people that I don't know but they follow me on Facebook or they see the races that I've been winning and coming in top 10 in every race that I've done this year. It's really putting my name out there.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T05:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:35:38.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
