There were gentle hugs all around after the Jays’ 92nd win before a corporal’s cadre of friends and relatives as the Jays won the AL East for the sixth time in franchise history. \nThere were embraces on the mound before players left the field to form another line hugging manager John Gibbons, his coaches, general manager Alex Anthopoulos, assistant GMs Tony LaCava and Andrew Tinnish, executives Stephen Brooks, Dana Brown, along with three men who were working for the Jays 22 years ago Jeff Ross, Kevin Malloy and Jay Stenhouse. \nIn the top of the ninth with Jays fans feeling a tad full of themselves — and maybe Natty Boh (National Bohemian) beer — and after watching Jose Bautista and Justin Smoak go deep, they began a “Thank you Alex, Thank you Alex” cheer to Anthopoulos seated behind the third base dugout. It was the Jays’ 26th time scoring in double figures this season. \nThe Way it began \nOn opening night in New York, Dalton Pompey started in centre, Devon Travis was at second, Jose Reyes was at short, Drew Hutchison was on the mound and Kevin Pillar was in left in place of Michael Saunders, whom the Jays traded for was supposed to be the every day left fielder. \nIt has been said five or six — thousand times — that baseball, like life, is a game of adjustments. \nThe Jays made adjustments on the way to winning. \nPompey was demoted the first week of May, returning as a September call up, while Pillar went from a scheduled back-up role to playing Gold Glove defence in centre. \nTravis injured his left shoulder and has not started since July 25. \nHutchison, the opening day starter and winner, was removed from the rotation and has not started since Sept. 9. \nSaunders, who stepped on a sprinkler head, started only nine games, none since May 9. \nReyes was dealt to the Colorado Rockies July 28 for shortstop Troy Tulowitzki. \nThe only Jays in the opening day lineup and Wednesday were Russell Martin, Jose Bautista, Josh Donaldson and Pillar. Only Bautista and Pillar were in the same spots in the batting order and only Bautista played the same position in the field. \nThe Jays did an August AA Airlift — Alex Anthopoulos, not American Airlines — bringing in Tulowitzki, Hawkins, David Price, Ben Revere and Mark Lowe. \nThe winner in the clincher was bouncy Marcus Stroman, who tore his ACL in a fielding drill in spring training and was thought to be lost for the year. He pitched eight innings. \nCulture shock \nMuch was made of how the culture changed when the Jays said goodbye to Brett Lawrie, Colby Rasmus, Adam Lind and Casey Janssen, and hello to players like Martin and Donaldson, who had won before with other teams. \nMaybe, but when Tulowitzki played his first game the Jays were 50-51. \n“The change started in the spring,” said Mark Buehrle, “a change in culture doesn’t always result in wins.” \nThe 1991 Jays were a talented team, and they improved in 1992 when Dave Winfield and Jack Morris arrived. \nThe next year, 1993, Paul Molitor and Dave Stewart were an influx of experienced talent looking to win. \nThis year’s Jays were talented. They climbed a competitive notch with the arrival of Donaldson and Martin and jumped again when Tulowitzki and Price arrived. \n“We got a bit of a kick in the butt at the deadline,” said Buehrle. \nTulowitzki didn’t make an error in 162 chances throwing on the run, from the hole and ranging into the outfield as he did at Yankee Stadium when Pillar’s chinny-chin chin crashed into his shoulder blade causing a small crack. He is close to returning to the lineup. \nWhile Tulowitzki only hit .214 with three homers and eight RBIs in August, he provided protection for Encarnacion, who hit 11 doubles, 11 homers, drove in 35 runs, hit .407 and had a 1.379 OPS. \n“I always thought we could be this good,” Encarnacion said. “We needed to put things together and in August we did.” \nIt will be almost 22 years between post-season appearances ... from Oct 23, 1993, to Thursday Oct. 8, a span of 8,020 days \nIn between the Jays played 3,499 games. \nBack in 1993 when Jays fans honked horns on Yonge St., Buehrle was in grade 8, R.A. Dickey was in grade 11, Hawkins was a third-year pro at class Fort Wayne and Gibbons was a minor-league instructor with the New York Mets. \nWhen Joe Carter hit his homer Aaron Sanchez was 114 days old, while closer Roberto Osuna and Pompey were not even born. \nAs Hall of Fame broadcaster Tom Cheek said so eloquently so many year ago and is probably saying it again: \n“And the Blue Jays are the champs! The Blue Jays are the champs of the American League East!” \nUnderstanding \nBuehrle comprehends the passion amongst the fans and excitement since the Jays have not played a post-season game since 1993. \n“It’s like when we won the World Series in 2005 with the Chicago White Sox,” Buehrle said. “People were talking about the franchise not winning since 1917 ... I was like ‘sorry, I wasn’t even around then, I wasn’t even thought about being around then. I can’t take responsibility for that. \n“Same with here. Toronto hasn’t won since 1993 ... well this is only my third year here.” \nCelebrations \nWhen the Jays clinched their first post-season berth it came in the first few hours of Saturday morning. They didn’t even know they had won until arriving at the park and having the logistics explained to them. \nThen, they beat the Tampa Bay Rays 10-8 and celebrated. \nAnd on a Wednesday afternoon in Game 1 of a doubleheader the magic number went from one to zero, the Jays had clinched the AL East title. Rather than a wild celebration there was a second game to play, although none of the Game 1 starters were in the lineup. \nCan con \nRevere reached on a bang-bang play to open the Game 1 as first base ump Stu Scheurwater of Regina said the lead-off man beat the throw from second baseman Jonathan Schoop. O’s manager Buck Showalter appealed the call. After checking with New York, the play was reversed. \nWrapping it up \nThe last time the Jays clinched the AL East came on a chilly, rainy night in Milwaukee on Sept. 27, 1993 at County Stadium. Right-hander Pat Hentgen pitched 62/3 scoreless throwing 114 pitches. Manager Cito Gaston used Tony Castillo, Mike Timlin and Duane Ward for 21/3 hitless innings. Hentgen won his 19th game and Ward saved his 43rd in the 2-0 win before 14,931. \nFormer Brewer Paul Molitor homered in the second and Devon White knocked in Ed Sprague, who had singled and raced to third on Robbie Alomar’s double. \nOmen \nMASN-TV was showing an Orioles classic game against the California Angels Wednesday afternoon from July 15, 1989 at Memorial Stadium. And the first player we saw on the TV? Angels lean Gold Glove centre fielder Devon White, who singled in the sixth, stole second and scored on a Tony Armas single. \nWhite knocked in one of the runs on Sept. 27, 1993 for the Jays the last time the Jays clinched. \nWhite was 3-for-4 for the Angels in 1989. What made the game memorable in O’s history was Mike Devereaux hitting a walk-off, two-run drive down the left-field line. Manager Doug Rader argued for 10 minutes that the ball was foul. The next day he was ejected when he handed in the lineup to the crew of Ken Kaiser, Larry Young, Jim Joyce and Jim McKean. It contained a nasty ad lib or two. \nOne from the hallway \nLaCava, assistant GM, walking into Camden Yards with Jays analysts Joe Sheehan and Jason Pare and seeing broadcaster Jerry Howarth: “Why don’t you do your own version of Russ Hodges classic call in 1951 when Bobby Thomson homered and he said, ‘The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant!’ You could say ‘The analysts win the pennant! The analysts win the pennant!’ You’d be a big hit in the analytics community.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:23:34.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
