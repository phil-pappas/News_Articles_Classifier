As of Monday morning, the video had nearly 5,000 views.\nThree years ago, Barnhart also wrote a song for the grieving families after the Sandy Hook shooting.\nBarnhart has a couple dozen videos of her songs on YouTube, many of them covers of popular artists, but among them, these two pieces of original work.\n-- Jessica Greif\njgreif@oregonian.com\n@JessicaDGreif", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/jessicadgreif", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtSk3QoLpAw", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFyPNk2ILGU"], "published": "2015-10-12T21:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:12:46.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
