Stacy Long , Montgomery Advertiser 7:15 p.m. CDT October 19, 2015 Troy kicker Jed Solomon and holder John Johnson (2) react to Soloman's missed field goal in the final minute in the loss to Idaho at Veterans Memorial Stadium in Troy, Ala. on Saturday October 17, 2015.

Foot first. \n“I will,” Solomon said. “I’ll probably hit that 32-yarder from the right hash about 15 times at practice.” \nSolomon, like the rest of the Trojans, was in despair when he missed a 32-yard field goal in the final minute of last weekend’s 19-16 home loss to Idaho. \nWhen the ball hit the upright, Solomon dropped to the ground. \n“It took me by shock,” Solomon said. \nHe had made three field goals, including a career-long 41-yarder, and had even recovered an onsides kick. It was the first time he’d recovered one in his memory. \nThose made the last one sting even more. \n“It was the best ball I hit all night,” Solomon said. “When I hit it, I was still looking down and I thought, ‘I got a hold of that one. I hit that one really good.’ \n“I looked up and it was going right at the upright.” Troy kicker Jed Solomon said his last-minute missed field goal in last weekend's 19-16 loss to Idaho left him stunned. Stacy Long \nSoon, teammates were consoling. Afterward, the Trojans, including coach Neal Brown, said it wasn’t the difference between winning and losing. \nFour turnovers, including one inside the Idaho 2-yard line, were more to blame. \n“I just told him to keep his head up,” said receiver Teddy Ruben, one of the first players to reach Solomon after the final kick. \n“We don’t lose the game on just one single play,” Ruben said. “It’s a combination of plays, so I told him to keep his head up and go get the next one.” \nSolomon reviewed the film Sunday, planned to rehash the final kick Monday and then said he would forget all about it. \n“There is no excuse for missing it. I should have made it,” Solomon said. “I keep up with my kicks day to day (in practice) and I haven’t missed one in 2-3 weeks. \n“If I could do it again, I probably make it nine out of 10 times.” \nThe Trojans, who play Saturday at New Mexico State, say they’re not worried about Solomon. Kicking, like golf, requires a certain steely mental approach. \nSolomon’s fits. \n“Kicking itself is a lot like a golf swing,” Troy special teams coordinator Shayne Wasden said. “They have to have about the same mentality as a golfer. \n“He’s a pretty strong guy, so he’ll be fine.” Troy special teams coordinator Shayne Wasden says kicker Jed Solomon won't have lingering issues after his last-minute miss against Idaho.
