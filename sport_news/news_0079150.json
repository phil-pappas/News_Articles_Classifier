She began doing poorly last November due to a compromised kidney, and the staff increased her vitamins and potassium supplements, he said.\nSenior zookeeper Tony York said Sarabi seemed to improve but fell ill again once her companion, Cosmo, 18, died in August.\n“Once Cosmo passed, she wasn’t the same,” he said. “She was lonely and was reluctant to come into the den.”\nSarabi came to the BioPark four years ago from Texas as a companion to Cosmo. Nineteen years is an average lifespan for a big cat in captivity, Zimmerman said, and those in the wild live an average of 10 to 14 years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:23:48.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
