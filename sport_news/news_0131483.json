Jerry Brown, reports say .\nThe new law, the California Racial Mascots Act, will affect four schools in the state, reports the Los Angeles Times . California is the first state to pass a law addressing the use of Redskins, which some Native American groups find offensive.\nThe law takes effect on Jan. 2, 2017, giving schools time to phase out the nickname and alleviate costs, the Times reports.\nOn Sunday, Oneida Indian Nation Representative Ray Halbritter and National Congress of American Indians Executive Director Jackie Pata issued a statement calling for the NFL's Washington Redskins to change its name.\n\"This landmark legislation eliminating the R-word in California schools clearly demonstrates that this issue is not going away, and that opposition to the Washington team on this issue is only intensifying. The NFL should act immediately to press the team to change the name,\" the statement said, according to the Times.\nThe NFL team has resisted calls to change its name, even though it lost its federal trademark in July 2015.", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/judge-upholds-cancellation-of-redskins-trademarks-in-a-legal-and-symbolic-setback-for-team/2015/07/08/5a65424e-1e6e-11e5-aeb9-a411a84c9d55_story.html", "http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/13867865/california-prohibits-public-schools-use-redskins-team-name-mascot", "http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-me-pc-redskins-mascot-banned-20151011-story.html"], "published": "2015-10-12T11:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:30:28.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
