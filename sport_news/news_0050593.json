Photo: Michael Goulding, Associated Press Image 24 of 24 Cal flops on national TV, routed 40-24 by UCLA 1 / 24 Back to Gallery \nPASADENA — In the wake of a nationally televised loss at No. 5 Utah, Cal entered its bye last week with simple objectives: limit turnovers, fine-tune technique and return to the team that had enjoyed its first 5-0 start in eight years. \nThe extra prep time couldn’t keep the Bears from drifting further from their blueprint. \nIn its 40-24 loss Thursday night at UCLA, No. 20 Cal slogged through uncharacteristic errors. Sacks and forced turnovers — the foundation of a much-improved Bears defense — proved fleeting. An offense stockpiled with playmakers sputtered during critical stretches.
