The Hawks scored three goals in a 4-minute span and was in full command by halftime with a 4-1 lead.“After scoring early, being down 1-4 at halftime sent us back to the drawing board,” Terpsma said.Ripon Christian changed its formation and lineup for the second half, but the shake-up didn’t affect the outcome. The Knights will next head to Waterford on Thursday.GOLFEast Union 218, Weston Ranch 345STOCKTON — Brooke Riley shot 2-under-34 at Van Buskirk Golf Course as East Union (12-0) continued its march toward a Valley Oak League championship.Natalie Cowan (41), Brittany Conjin (45), Rebeca Leonard (46) and Presley Graham (56) also earned points for the individual standings.
