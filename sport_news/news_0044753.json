(AP) — New York Jets cornerback Buster Skrine is likely to play Sunday against the New England Patriots despite being limited at practice while recovering from a concussion. \nSkrine suffered a head injury last Sunday against Washington and is going through the NFL’s concussion protocol. He is listed as probable and says Friday that he needs to pass two more tests before he’s officially cleared to play. \nSkrine would play an important role in the Jets’ scheme against the Patriots, particularly defending tight end Rob Gronkowski and wide receivers Danny Amendola and Julian Edelman on short pass plays. \nBackup running back Bilal Powell (ankle) has been ruled out. Stevan Ridley could make his season debut after tearing two knee ligaments more than a year ago while with the Patriots. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:14:53.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
