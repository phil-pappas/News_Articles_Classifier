He has dropped only three sets out of 51 in his five appearances. He didn't play in 2011.\nBesides singles, Djokovic is also teaming with younger brother Djordje in doubles for the first time at an ATP Tour event.\nRafael Nadal also advanced to the second round, beating Chinese wild-card entry Wu Di 6-4, 6-4. Nadal dropped serve four times in the match, including three straight games in the second set.\nThe third-seeded Nadal is in the uncharacteristic position of needing a strong finish to the season to qualify for the ATP Finals in London next month.\nThe Spaniard looked to be cruising against the No. 230-ranked Wu, playing his first top-10 opponent, when he broke to take a 1-0 lead in the second set. But Wu broke right back, and then twice more before Nadal was finally able to serve it out.\n''I think I played little bit too ... far away from the baseline,'' Nadal said. ''The last three games of the match I was playing better. I hit some good forehands down the line and that's why I finished well.''\nOn the women's side, U.S. Open champion Flavia Pennetta of Italy rallied to advance to the third round with a 3-6, 6-0, 6-4 win over Teliana Pereira of Brazil.\nAlso, eighth-seeded Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark defeated Chinese wild-card entry Wang Qiang 7-5, 6-0, and 10th-seeded Angelique Kerber of Germany beat Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia 6-1, 6-4.\nFor the second straight day, the pollution in Beijing reached hazardous levels, according to the U.S. Embassy's real-time air quality index.\n''The pollution, I think we're used to it when we play here,'' Wozniacki said. ''You know, we just play. We just play.''\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T04:40:11.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
