The NOAA has just released its predictions for the 2015-2016 winter , and El Nino is making its presence known.\nThe Southeast, with most of Georgia with it, is predicted to have a colder than usual winter. There will also be a higher than normal amount of precipitation according to models. \"A strong El Ni√±o is in place and should exert a strong influence over our weather this winter,\" said deputy director of NOAA's Climate Prediction Center Mike Halpert .\nSo, does this mean we will have another year of potentially crippling winter storms? While the severity and timing of winter storms cannot be predicted using this model, the ingredients are there.\nLast year the Northeast was hit by record breaking winter storms, while Georgia saw a mild winter that resulted in very little snow and ice. Mild winters are something Georgians should get used to. Climate Central predictions have Sandy Springs feeling more like Pensacola, Fla. by the year 2100.\nHowever, if Georgia is hit by another ice storm reminiscent of 2014, here's our guide on preparing your house and your car for a storm.", "external_links": ["http://www.accessatlanta.com/weblogs/buzz/2014/feb/11/pro-tips-prepping-pre-ice-storm/", "http://www.weather.com/storms/winter/news/winter-outlook-2015-2016-noaa-wsi", "http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/long_range/seasonal.php?lead=2"], "published": "2015-10-16T19:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:23:30.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
