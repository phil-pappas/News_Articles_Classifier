I just didn't quite know how my results would go. \n\"Even though I didn't play my best tennis today I still got through, and that's what matters, especially against such a tough competitor like Radwanska. We always have such close matches here. \n\"To fight hard and be able to win the match in the end means so much to me.\" \nEarlier in the same group, Simona Halep avenged her semi-final defeat at the US Open with a 6-0 6-3 win over 33-year-old Italian Flavia Pennetta in her first outing since her first-round retirement at the China Open in Beijing two weeks ago. \nThe top-seeded Halep, who had lost four of five previous meetings with Pennetta including a 59-minute stunner in Flushing Meadows - turned it around completely in Singapore, racing through the first set in just 25 minutes and, after staying on serve through the first seven games of the second set, getting one last break of serve for 5-3 before serving the match out. \n\"I started the match really well. I played my best in the first set, fast, smart and aggressive,\" Halep said in her on-court interview. \"I was really enjoying the match today. I was really happy to be back here.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:23:46.711+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
