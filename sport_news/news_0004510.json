We just didn’t execute. That’s what it came down to. (Oklahoma) came to play and we didn’t. \n“I’ve never been through a game like that, where you get flat-out embarrassed in front of everyone, in front of the world. Nobody wants go through something like that again.” \nMonday’s players’ meeting certainly seems to have been a first step in healing Saturday’s deep wound. \n“It was pretty much, ‘we need to get on the same page because we have a lot of games left and we can finish with a good record still,” junior offensive lineman Terrale Johnson said. “The captains told everyone we can’t be hanging our heads and we need to move forward — a positive thing so we keep rolling. \n“I thought it was real positive.” \nDavis said a players-only meeting is commonplace when the season starts, but he couldn’t recall one during a season and certainly not with the tone of Monday’s gathering. \nUrgency has set in — that was evident at Monday’s practice. \n“I think it did carry over into practice,” he said. “Some of the things that were said carried over into practice and helped keep some guys focused. I think it really benefited us.” \nOnly time will tell, but what is known is that K-State has lost three straight games and has a daunting matchup at home with Baylor looming on Nov. 5. The worst-case scenario for the Wildcats right now would be for this three-game skid to turn into four and then five straight losses. \nThe last K-State time lost three straight Big 12 games was the 2013 season before finishing the year on a hot streak and a win in the Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl. \nCan this season’s Wildcats do the same? \nMonday’s meeting was about doing just that, before it’s too late. \n“It was about keeping guys’ minds on the right track and where they’re supposed to be,” Davis said. “It was to let guys talk about little bit about how they feel about the season, how we should practice, more of a motivational meeting than anything.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:35:15.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
