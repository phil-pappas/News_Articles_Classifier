Wade Hamilton. He said the apples were hanging over a fence surrounding the property, which Beeler owns.\nThe Smiths told authorities they dumped the apples on the ground then went nearby to pick apples from another tree, this one growing outside the fence. Beeler then fired at them from an unknown distance using a long gun, police said.\nNo one was hurt, Charlevoix County sheriff's deputies told PetoskeyNews.com .\nThe Smiths, both of Boyne Falls, called 911, and a DNR officer helped transport then out of the area. Police later helped retrieve their ORVs, Hamilton said.\nBeeler was charged with felonious assault and felony firearm, She was arraigned Sept. 29 in 90th District Court where a judge set a $50,000 bond.", "external_links": ["http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2015/10/woman_who_fired_gun_at_apple_p.html", "http://www.petoskeynews.com/featured-pnr/boyne-falls-woman-arrested-for-shooting-at-apple-pickers/article_e47bae88-6eb8-11e5-ad5c-9323ea3de09a.html"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:08:03.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
