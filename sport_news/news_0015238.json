The 23-year-old quarterback has had a full week to prepare for the today’s game at Mosaic Stadium against the playoff-bound Eskimos (12-4). The 2-13 Riders have been eliminated from playoff contention. \n“(The preparation) helps a lot just because they have a lot of difficult things that you have to adjust for,’’ Smith said Friday in advance of today’s game (5 p.m., TSN, CKRM). “There are a lot of personnel that we’re able to see and pinpoint now that we’ve had the extra days. I’m grateful for that.’’ \nSimilar to the first game, Smith is replacing Glenn as the Riders’ starting quarterback. While it was due to injury back then, this time it’s because Glenn was traded to the Montreal Alouettes on Oct. 14 for a fifth-round selection in the 2016 CFL draft. The transaction meant Smith has returned as the starting quarterback. Keith Price and Blake Sims will back up Smith during today’s game. \nThe game in Edmonton marked Smith’s first start as a CFL quarterback. He completed 15 of 22 passes for 132 yards without any touchdowns and two interceptions. One pick was returned 47 yards by Patrick Watkins for a third-quarter touchdown. \nSmith has rewatched the video from the game. He feels that he’s a different quarterback with five other starts since the Edmonton game. Smith was demoted to backup on Sept. 20 when Glenn returned from his stint on the six-game injured list. \n“I was so amped up for that game,’’ Smith said. “Football is such an emotional game because it causes you to do things that you might not normally do if you’re relaxed. Watching (the video) I definitely looked more antsy than I did in my other games.’’ \nThe Glenn trade means offensive co-ordinator Jacques Chapdelaine is preparing Smith to take on the Eskimos. It’s a daunting task considering the Eskimos led the CFL heading into the weekend in fewest points allowed (16.1 per game), yards (290.9), rushing yards (65.3), passing yards (243.9) and passing TDs (17). \nChapdelaine feels Smith may have more success today against Edmonton’s top-ranked defence due to the experience the young quarterback has gained through the season. \n“He has more experience, but I’m not sure if he’s an entirely different quarterback,’’ Chapdelaine said. “He’s going to carry some of the positive things that he did in that game and he still has that. He has grown from his experiences and from game to game he will keep growing.’’ \nTrading Glenn left Chapdelaine working with three young quarterbacks. The remaining three regular-season games are an opportunity to evaluate the trio and prepare them for the 2016 season. \n“I believe that Brett, Keith and perhaps Blake, even though we don’t know too much about him, have things they can bring to the table to be good players in this league,’’ Chapdelaine said. “Anytime they can be in a position where they can get more snaps and more experience, we want it. It’s my responsibility to make sure we put these men in a good position to be successful so they can shine a light on themselves and the rest of the team. Hopefully it helps them and all of us.’’ \nPrice is expected to make his CFL debut today. How much action he will see remains to be seen because the Riders wouldn’t disclose their plans for a possible quarterback rotation. Price, who is ready regardless of how much he will play, expects Smith to perform better today than he did in his first start against the Eskimos. \n“Brett knows that he is much better than what he showed last time,’’ Price said. “He will play better. Trust me.’’ \nmmccormick@leaderpost.com \ntwitter.com/murraylp", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:34:30.270+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
