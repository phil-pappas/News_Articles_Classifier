Coast Guard searchers found one of the El Faro’s destroyed lifeboats during a six-day search. National Transportation Safety Board The El Faro’s sister ship, El Yunque, returned to Jacksonville so that NTSB investigators could inspect the ship and question crew about operating the ship. National Transportation Safety Board 1 of 2   \nThe El Faro, an aging ship with two boilers in need of servicing, set sail about three hours after the National Hurricane Center warned that Tropical Storm Joaquin would likely strengthen to a hurricane a day later, National Transportation Safety Board investigators reported Tuesday. \nThe report, the first detailed findings in the NTSB’s ongoing investigation of the ship’s Oct. 1 sinking, contradicts an account by the ship’s owner, TOTE, Inc., days after the ship disappeared near Crooked Island in the Bahamas with a crew of 33. The findings also provide a fuller picture of the ship’s final moments, reporting for the first time that one of the El Faro’s two boilers was shut down for inspection about two weeks before the ship sank 20 miles from the eye of the powerful storm. \nAccording to the report, the El Faro set sail at 8:15 p.m. Sept. 29, after forecasters warned that Joaquin would likely intensify. At 1:12 p.m. the next day, Capt. Michael Davidson emailed company officials to say he intended to dodge the storm by plotting a course that would take the ship about 65 miles from its center. \nAt that point, the hurricane center was already warning that Joaquin, now a Category 1 hurricane nearly stalled over record-warm waters, would likely grow into a fierce storm. \n“It is expected that additional intensification could occur through 72 hours,” forecasters warned two hours earlier. “Based on this, the intensity forecast calls for Joaquin to peak as a major hurricane in about 72 hours, and it is possible it could be stronger than currently forecast.” \nIn response to questions from the Herald, TOTE spokeswoman Moira Whalen referred questions to the NTSB. \n“Out of respect for our seafarers and for every seafarer here and around the world, it is critical that we understand what contributed to this accident. And to this end, we will not jeopardize the investigation by speculating on the events surrounding the sinking of the El Faro,” she wrote. \nThe first sign of trouble came the next day at 7 a.m. when Davidson contacted the company’s call center to report an emergency, investigators said. In a recorded call, Davidson said the ship’s hull had a breach, a scuttle had blown open and water had entered one of the ship’s holds. The ship had lost propulsion and engineers could not restart it, he said. \nAn operator, according to the report, then connected the captain to an onshore company contact who told investigators Davidson repeated the same information. Davidson, the contact previously said, sounded calm when he reported waves at between 10 and 12 feet high. \nBut within moments, the Coast Guard received three emergency alerts from the ship, including a security alert, an Inmarsat-C Alert, and a distress call from ship’s Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB). The last alert at 7:17 a.m., put the ship 20 miles from Joaquin’s eye. By then, the storm had grown to a fierce Category 3 storm, with 120 mph sustained winds extending 35 miles. \nInvestigators also reported that a little over two weeks before the El Faro sank, one of the ship’s two boilers was shut down during a trip from San Juan to Jacksonville so it could be inspected by a company contracted by TOTE. After the inspection, the company recommended service to both boilers while the ship was at port for a scheduled dry dock service on Nov. 6. \nInvestigators also interviewed two harbor pilots who guided the El Faro through the Jacksonville port when it departed. Both reported the ship handled like any other vessel of its size and type. \nThe El Faro also passed its annual Coast Guard inspection in March, investigators noted. The American Bureau of Shipping, an industry safety group, also inspected the ship in February. Some problems were discovered and corrected, investigators said, but none related to the ship’s propulsion. The ship also passed a June safety inspection by the group. \nNTSB investigators hope to locate the ship’s wreckage on the ocean floor and recover its voyage data recorder, which could provide more clues about what went wrong. A Navy tug outfitted with special sensors to find the ship, which set sail from Virginia Monday, is expected to arrive in the El Faro’s last known position on Saturday. The search is expected to last two weeks. Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:31:10.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
