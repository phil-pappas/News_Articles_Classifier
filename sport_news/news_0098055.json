The Catamounts have won four straight and are unbeaten in their last five matches.\nClay Gattey came off the bench to give UVM a 1-0 lead late in the first half. Elliot Maker back-heeled a pass to Gideon Rosenthal on the endline. Rosenthal sent a cross into the goal mouth and Gattey was there to finish off the play with a header and his first career goal as a Catamount in the 43rd minute.\nBryant came back to even the game in the 57th minute. UVM failed to see a ball cross the endline and some scrappy play from Brett Laroque allowed him to quickly turn and fire a shot near post from close range to level the score at 1-1.\nLamanna's second goal as a Catamount was able to break the tie and lift UVM to the win.\nVermont remains unbeaten at home this season (3-0-1) and improves to 5-3-1 overall. Bryant falls to 1-5-2 on the season.\nGreg Walton did not have to make a stop to pick up the win in the match, while Nick Stewart was credited with two saves in the Bryant net.\nVermont returns to action on Saturday (Oct. 3) when it hosts Binghamton in the America East opener at 1 p.m. at Virtue Field.\nSophomore Sarah Martin's strike from distance in the 15th minute of action was all the Vermont Catamounts needed to post a 1-0 victory over visiting Stony Brook in women's soccer action at Virtue Field on Sunday.\nVermont has won two straight and is unbeaten in its last three matches. The Catamounts improved to 4-4-1 on the year and open league play at 1-0-0. Stony Brook falls to 3-6-2 overall and 0-1-0 in America East.\nMartin collected a ball on the left wing, made a move, hesitated and fired in a shot from 20 yards out to give UVM the 1-0 lead at the 14:54 mark of the first stanza. It was Martin's first goal of the season.\nThe Catamounts were able to hold off the Seawolves the rest of the way to pick up the conference win.\nUVM out shot Stony Brook 28-9 in the match. Emily Doherty was credited with eight saves in the Stony Brook net, while Ally Ramos made four stops in the Vermont net to pick up the shutout.\nVermont returns to action on Thursday (Oct. 1) when it hosts New Hampshire, the defending America East Champions, at 3 p.m. at Virtue Field.\nCourtesy: Vermont Athletics", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:21:51.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
