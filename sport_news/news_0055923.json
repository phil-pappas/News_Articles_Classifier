He called them Cubbie Occurrences.\nThe team is on the cusp of getting swept by the Mets in the National League Championship Series, but there hasn’t been one catastrophic, soul-crushing thing that has done the Cubs in. No left fielder freaking out over a foul ball, a la Moises Alou. No grounder rolling through Alex Gonzalez’ legs. No Cubbie Occurrences.\nThe Cubs’ problems in this series have been systemic. They needed their two best pitchers to pitch their best in Games 1 and 2. Neither did. They needed hitting, and they haven’t gotten it.\nThey needed a third starter for the postseason, but chose to stand down at the trade deadline. They paid for it in Game 3, a 5-2 loss, when Kyle Hendricks pitched four innings and Joe Maddon’s bullpen-orama couldn’t do what it did in Game 4 of the NL Division Series.\nJason Hammel, who only lasted three innings in that game against the Cardinals, is scheduled to start Wednesday in Game 4. In positive news, he should be rested.\nIt’s not over. The Cubs have been resilient all season, but the bounce-back this time will have to resemble an elephant gun’s recoil. To inspire his troops, Maddon played the theme from “Rocky” on the off day before Game 3. He might want to push the “Rocky II’’ angle this time. Rocky actually wins that fight.\nThe only team to come back from a 3-0 deficit in a seven-game series was the 2004 Red Sox, who overcame the Yankees in the American League Championship Series and went on to win the World Series.\n“The confidence in this clubhouse is never going to go away,’’ first baseman Anthony Rizzo said. “We just got to keep playing baseball. One New York team has blown a 3-0 lead, let’s make it the other New York team. That’s the way we’re going to look at it.’’\nBad things happened in Tuesday’s game at Wrigley Field, but if the Cubs end up losing this series, history won’t point a finger at a particular play and say, “Typical Cubs team done in by typical Cubs’ play.’’ The Mets have simply been the better team.\nBut about those bad things. Cubs reliever Trevor Cahill struck out Michael Conforto in the sixth inning, though the wild pitch blew past catcher Miguel Montero, allowing Yoenis Cespedes to score from third and giving the Mets a 3-2 lead.\n“I blocked like three before that,’’ Montero said. “It’s a tough one. I went down to block it. I just unfortunately didn’t. It really hurts. I blocked pitches like that many, many times.’’\nRight fielder Jorge Soler made a bad error on a line drive by the next batter, Wilmer Flores. Center fielder Dexter Fowler chased after the ball, watched it disappear in the ivy on the outfield wall and raised his hands without bothering to look for it. It was called a ground-rule double, which meant that Conforto had to go back to third. Smart play by Fowler. The damage ended up being contained.\nThere is a price to pay for depending on young players. The Soler error was an example. Kyle Schwarber’s botched attempt at a Cespedes line drive to left in the seventh was another. That led to a run. You want Schwarber’s bat in the lineup, but you’re basically hiding him in left field at this point in his career. Soler is 23, Schwarber a year younger. Both had home runs Tuesday. Mostly you live with them. Sometimes you have to die a little.\nBut at least they hit. The Cubs only managed two other hits off Mets starter Jacob deGrom, who went seven innings and struck out seven. The Cubs can’t win like that. Warm weather, cold weather, it doesn’t matter. Cubs hitters haven’t helped Cubs pitchers.\n“They outplayed us all around — pitching, defense, running the bases,’’ Rizzo said of the Mets. “You’ve got to go home and get a good night rest and come back ready to go.’’\nSo now it comes down to Game 4 on Wednesday at Wrigley. Win or else. Win or we’ll be talking about what a great season it was and what a great future lies ahead. That won’t make the NLCS look any better.\n“We don’t have any options,’’ Montero said. “The only option we have is to win.’’\nThe Cubs, a team that has won 101 games this season, is struggling to get one more. Hard to believe after all they’ve done. But brutally true.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:12:02.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
