It's a new season for both teams and it's going to be tough. It's going to be a dogfight.” \nSchartz, who was inducted into the Washburn University Hall of Fame last weekend, said he has been pleased with how his team has handled last week's tough loss. \n“They've been great,” Schartz said. “We're pretty upbeat around here because we played so well. We have a young team, and I feel like we're hitting our stride at the right time of the season. \n“We're as healthy as we've been and we're playing good football at the right time of the year.” \nStill, Schartz knows his team will face a tough test against a Topeka High team that has not had a game closer than 11 points. The Trojans won last year's game, 52-41. \n“They're very good,” Schartz said of the Trojans. “They have a big offensive front. They want to run the football, but they also have the athletes to throw the ball down field . \n“I have no doubt that my kids are going to show up and play hard, and we're going to be in the right spot at the right time. But Topeka High has the ability that even if you're in the right spot at the right time they can use their phenomenal athleticism to make plays.” \nTopeka High is coming off a 37-7 win over Shawnee Heights although the Trojans were hit with 17 penalties for 155 yards. Alexander said the key Friday will be for the Trojans to be at their best across the board. \n“We just have to play the best that we can play as hard as we can do it,” Alexander said. “I know that they're going to play the same way and hopefully it's a good football game and it's a clean football game. \n“It's just going to be fun for everybody to watch and hopefully we come out on top. We want to win the football game and our kids are going to give everything they can to do that.” \nTopeka High senior Mike McCoy has rushed for 960 yards on 74 attempts and has scored 19 touchdowns. Trojan junior quarterback Corey Thomas has accumulated 1,306 total yards (574 rushing, 732 passing) and has thrown for 15 touchdowns. \nManhattan has gotten a big year from junior quarterback Ian Trapp, a transfer from Ellsworth. \nFriday’s game will be televised on Kansas Cox 22. \nThe other District 5 game Friday will pit 3-3 Free State against 5-1 Washburn Rural at Rural's Bowen-Glaze Stadium. \nFRIDAY'S OTHER CITY GAMES \n(All games at 7 p.m.) \nSHAWNEE HEIGHTS (0-6) at HIGHLAND PARK (0-6) \nOne of these two teams will pick up their first win of the year and get a leg up for a 5A playoff berth. Shawnee Heights is coming off a 37-7 loss to unbeaten Topeka High while Highland Park dropped a 55-0 decision to 5-1 Washburn Rural. Shawnee Heights junior quarterback Trey Brown has passed for 443 yards while senior Alex Sheikh has rushed for 311 yards. Highland Park sophomore Jerry Evans has rushed for 335 yards. The other 5A District 3 game pitted Seaman against Topeka West Thursday night. \nFREE STATE (3-3) at WASHBURN RURAL (5-1) \nFree State is the defending champion in 6A District 5 and the Firebirds seem to be hitting their stride despite a tough schedule. Washburn Rural assured itself of a winning season with last Friday's 55-0 win over Highland Park, bouncing back from a two-win campaign in 2014. Rural senior Matthew Williams has rushed for 612 yards and scored nine touchdowns while senior quarterback Mitchell Schurig has passed for 570 yards and three touchdowns. The other District 5 opener matches Manhattan at Topeka High at Hummer Sports Park. \nHAYDEN (5-1) at ANDOVER CENTRAL (5-1) \nHayden, the 4A Division I runner-up last season, will begin defense of its District 6 championship Friday against a high-scoring Andover Central team, whose only loss came in a 51-41 offensive shootout against 5A Maize South. Hayden junior quarterback Dallas Crittenden has passed for 872 yards and eight touchdowns while senior Connor Schumacher has rushed for 416 yards and has caught 23 passes for 257 yards. Wildcat senior Mason Dodd has caught 27 passes for 403 yards. El Dorado will face Circle in Friday's other District 6 game at El Dorado.
