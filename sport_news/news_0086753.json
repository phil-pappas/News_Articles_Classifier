He finished tied 51st last year in Melbourne with scores of 78-75-74-77. \n\nPriyanshu, who closed Day 1 at tied 4th with 5under after 14 holes finished Round One at par af er four bogeys in the final four holes. Further bogeys on the 3rd, 12th, 13th and 18th and a double bogey on the 17th meant that he gave away yester day's advantage and finished tied 63rd with 4over-144 and miss the cut which fell at three-over and the top 60 players and best ties qualifying.
