It's a challenge or an opportunity and you can do it either way you want,\" Brownell told the media this week. \"Certainly, there are some challenges and it's a unique season and there are some difference, but it's also a great opportunity for us to continue to build our brand and our fanbase and excitement in the program. I think our athletic department has done a great job working with the Bon Secours Wellness Arena and the city of Greenville to help market us and to make people aware that we're going to be playing up there. \n\"Some of the things that they've done to the arena really look nice. It was for us to go up there yesterday and have a little bit of a dry run, although a little chilly certainly, it's a nice arena. If we can get fans in there, it's going to be a great home court. There's some challenges with timing and practicing and guys wanting to get back into the gym and get more shots at a few time. There are some inconveniences, but it shouldn't preclude us from having a great year.\" \nFor the first time in six seasons, Brownell gets the opportunity to coach team with the leading scorer from the previous season returning. Jaron Blossomgame Jaron Blossomgame #5 6-7, 220Alpharetta, GA View Full Profile made tremendous improvement during his sophomore season, and Brownell said having Blossomgame in the offense makes the rest of the team better. \n\"It's my sixth year and for the first time we've got a guy who we know is double-digit scorer coming back and led us scoring, and that makes you feel good,\" Brownell said. \"Yesterday in the scrimmage he led us in scoring again. It gives you a place to start offensively and something you kind of know, and then you can get better at some other things. You can look at other guys and what they can do. It gives you poise and confidence going into the season.\" \nClemson adds newcomers Ty Hudson Ty Hudson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:23:29.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
