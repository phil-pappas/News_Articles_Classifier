Jason Ogulnik/Las Vegas Review-Journal By Alan SnelLas Vegas Review-Journal \nGet ready for more white-glove experiences at Las Vegas' racetrack. \nConstruction equipment is demolishing seat sections above Turns 3 and 4 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway to make room for a relocated high-end hospitality area and a new 25-space luxury RV section. \nSpeedway officials are moving VIP hospitality, which has room for about 10,000 fans, to the new location from its former spot behind the grandstand. The new VIP section, to be used by corporate hospitality race fans and called, \"Vegas Village,\" will offer a closer view of the 1.5-mile track and a panoramic view of the Las Vegas valley. \nCompanies buy blocks of at least 50 tickets to gain entry into the VIP hospitality area, which will be above Turn 4. Single VIP tickets are not available. \nThe new luxury RV spots will be next to the new VIP hospitality location and offer high-end services to race fans. Each RV spot is 30 feet wide and will cost $8,000 for the speedway's signature event, NASCAR weekend in March when the Kobalt 400 is held on March 6. The new high-end RV area is called, Vegas Veranda. \n\"These RV customers want a white-glove experience,\" said Chris Powell, Las Vegas Motor Speedway president. \nEach new RV spot will include free Wi-Fi, continental breakfasts, garage tours, scanners to listen to driver/team communications, access to a lounge, a 10 percent gift purchase discount and eight passes. \nThere's even concierge service. \"You can get dry cleaning or a 30-pack of Bud Light from concierge,\" Powell said. \nThe speedway already has two other RV sections. One has space for 71 RVs along the back stretch, while a second RV area has room for 37 big vehicles. The RV spots along the back stretch each cost $3,500 for a NASCAR weekend — less than half of the $8,000-per-spot in the new high-end RV area. \nThe Las Vegas track is removing 15,000 seats above those two turns to clear space for the new VIP hospitality and RV locations. The improvements will be ready for NASCAR weekend in March and cost in the low six figures, Powell said. \nLosing the 15,000 seats and replacing them with a new hospitality area and RV location provides a better balance of seat options for fans, he said. \nOther improvements include enhancing the merchandise area by installing a big tent area where fans can buy NASCAR-licensed hats, shirts and jackets instead of purchasing merchandise from trailers. Las Vegas Motor Speedway generates more NASCAR merchandise gross sales than any other NASCAR track in the U.S., Powell said. \n\"It's a more fan-friendly shopping experience,\" Powell said of the improved sales area. \nThe speedway also wants to use extra space behind the grandstand to step up its efforts with interactive games to bolster its appeal to young fans and families. \nLas Vegas Motor Speedway is a wholly owned subsidiary of Speedway Motorsports, Inc. (SMI). \nContact reporter Alan Snel at asnel@reviewjournal.com .
