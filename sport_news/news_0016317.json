Those series-opening losses were a shock to the system for most Jays’ fans, who had grown accustomed to the team’s relentless progression in the second half of the season.\nOne out of every 10 Canadians watched Sunday’s Game 3 victory from home. Hundreds made the trip to Arlington to be among the 50,000 at Globe Life Park.\nIf the inherent tension wasn’t enough, there is added controversy in the fact it will be Stroman and not David Price — the veteran ace — who makes the start after the latter was used in relief to secure a Game 4 win .\nBut Stroman, a budding ace in his own right, is no slouch and would be the first choice of many. His expressive presence on the mound both feeds and is fuelled by a charged crowd, and the Rogers Centre figures to be at full wattage.\n“It’ll be fun,” said shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, the slump-busting hero of Game 3.\n“It’s Game 5. It’s not quite a Game 7, but it’s as close as you can get to that. It’s do-or-die for both teams. As a kid, that’s what you dream about.”\nJays fans are hoping the dream will continue a little while longer.\nMore on thestar.com\nNo matter what happens, enjoy these Blue Jays: Arthur\nEveryone needs to up their game if Blue Jays are to advance: Griffin", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:18:09.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
