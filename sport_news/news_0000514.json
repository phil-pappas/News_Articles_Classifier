Really? Because according to the map, AZ is getting Buffalo/NYG, KC/Cincy too. \"Begin with the end in mind and die empty.\" -A-Dub #35 Posts: 705 There is only one game per weekend worth watching. Everything else is noise. Heard that the Cardinals just aren't 'sexy'. They must be crazy. Every player on this team is a star and is someone you'd want to take home to mother. Age: 36 Posts: 4,702 The late Fox game has three top teams to choose from: Arizona, Green Bay & Denver. The Arizona game is the least broadcast of the 3. The Cardinals/Rams game won't be shown in the areas surrounding Arizona (Cali, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah) & even in parts of Arizona (NE corner of the state). I'm a little surprised they aren't showing the Rams games in LA... I guess they're worried that people might not buy season tickets once the Rams get moved there once they see them get destroyed by the Cardinals?
