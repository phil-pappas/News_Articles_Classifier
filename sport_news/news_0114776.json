Perceived as a young talent, it’s time turn into the Wizards’ veteran leader. \nThe Wizards have contended in the Eastern Conference, but have failed to get over the hump. Their successes and failures all fall on Wall. After a broken hand forced him to miss three games, they couldn’t get passed the Hawks in the second round. He’s steadily improved each year, but he expects to take another jump forward. \nThe biggest thing holding him back – turnovers. It isn’t the Achilles heel that used to stop him dead in his tracks, but 3.8 turnovers a game in 2014-15 is still unacceptable. His remedy? Wall will pay assistant coach Howard Eisley $100 for every game he commits three or more turnovers. A worst-case scenario would cost him $8,200, or $6,200 based off last years statistics. \nA bold strategy Cotton, let’s see if it pays off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:49:27.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
