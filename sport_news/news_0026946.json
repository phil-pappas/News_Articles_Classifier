ARMAS\nAP Sports Writer GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) - The Green Bay Packers are still perfect this season, even if Aaron Rodgers' remarkable run of mistake-free football at home is over.\nRodgers threw for two touchdowns and 241 yards, and the Packers (5-0) held off the St. Louis Rams for a 24-10 win on Sunday in spite of three turnovers by their MVP quarterback.\nRodgers was 19 of 30 for 241 yards with long scoring strikes to receivers Ty Montgomery and James Jones. But NFL-record streaks of 587 pass attempts and 49 touchdown passes at home without an interception for Rodgers ended in the first quarter on linebacker James Laurinaitis' diving pick of a tipped ball for the Rams (2-3).\nRodgers threw another interception in the second quarter before losing a fumble in the third.\nRelentless pressure on quarterback Nick Foles helped keep the Packers unbeaten. Foles threw a career-worst four interceptions, two in the fourth quarter inside the Packers 10.\nRookie cornerback Quinten Rollins returned an interception 45 yards for a touchdown for a 14-0 lead in the first quarter, and picked off another pass at the 7 with 23 seconds left. Safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix intercepted a tipped pass in the end zone on third-and-goal at the 7.\nThe turnovers wasted another strong effort for Rams rookie Todd Gurley, who for the second straight week had his best production, with 159 yards rushing on 30 carries. He dented a defense that had held opposing starting running backs to an average of 36 yards on 11 attempts the previous three games.\nBut a week after defeating previously unbeaten Arizona, the Rams couldn't repeat the feat on a warm fall afternoon in Green Bay.\nFoles was 11 of 30 for 141 yards and a touchdown. His longest completion came on a 68-yarder to Stedman Bailey late in the fourth quarter.\nOtherwise, the Packers' pass rush overwhelmed an inexperienced offensive line that lost veteran guard Rodger Saffold in the first quarter to a shoulder injury. Star linebacker Clay Matthews had 1 1/2 sacks.\nThe defense held up in spite of losing tackle B.J. Raji to a groin injury and linebacker Nick Perry (shoulder). Guard T.J. Lang also left in the first quarter with a knee injury.\n___\nOnline:\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/AP_NFL"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:29:35.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
