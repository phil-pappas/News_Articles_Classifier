It was the back end's turn on Saturday. The University of New Hampshire football team intercepted five passes in a 37-14 win over Elon after having none in the first four games. The Wildcats entered the homecoming contest with a league-leading 18 sacks — which ranked third nationally — but no interceptions. “We’ve had opportunities for a couple interceptions but haven’t made the plays,” said coach Sean McDonnell. “Today they came to us.” Defensive backs Lamar Edmonds, Casey DeAndrade and De'Andre Drummond Mayrie, and linebackers Akil Anderson and Ryan Farrell picked off passes as the Phoenix went to the air in an attempt to get back in a game they trailed 20-0 at the end of the first quarter and 34-0 late in the second. “We did a good job up front getting pressure on the quarterback,” Anderson said, “and when he made some throws guys just made plays on the ball.” UNH scored on its first two offensive possessions to set the tone. The Wildcats won the coin toss and opted to take the ball for the second game in a row instead of deferring to the second half. Dalton Crossan scored the first of his four touchdowns on the game's fifth play from scrimmage on his way to rushing for a career-high 140 yards on 22 carries. “I told the guys a couple weeks ago how we’re going to start playing again,” McDonnell said. “We put some pressure on the offense to come out and execute and they did. That allows our defense to play downhill.” The Phoenix completed only 23-of-52 passes. UNH held Elon to 8 total yards in the first quarter and negative 2 yards passing. The visitors finished with only 69 yards rushing. “When the offense goes out there and has a lot of success we feed off that,” Anderson said. “We had to stop the run to make them a little more one-dimensional.” “I thought we pressured the quarterback and got after him,” McDonnell said. “We tackled very well and kept them in long situations.” Defensive end Cam Shorey and tackle Rick Holt had sacks to add to a total that included eight the previous week against Central Connecticut State. One of those led directly to a touchdown when redshirt freshman Cyrus Boone caused a fumble that Farrell returned 15 yards for a score. UNH led the CAA in sacks last season, but had to find a way to replace the production lost to graduation. Of the 39 sacks, 26 came from defensive linemen. “We had four kids at defensive end and only one of them played,” said coach Sean McDonnell. “There were some question marks there.” So far the Wildcats have turned those question marks into exclamation points. Shorey, and senior tackles Jullian Turner and Rashid Armand had the most experience among the returning players up front. The secondary was expected to be a strength with the number of veterans the Wildcats had coming back. They came up with a handful of interceptions Saturday despite the absence of senior safety Daniel Rowe, who led the team in tackles through three games. He's missed the last two with a sprained knee. \"They're really good at what they do,\" said Elon coach Rich Skrosky. Shorey leads the team in sacks with five. The 3-2 Wildcats are averaging four sacks a game heading into their bye week. “Those guys up front do a great job,” Farrell said. “They work hard every day. I expect nothing less. They’re great players up there, and they do what they do pretty well.” UNH held Elon to 84 total yards on 35 offensive snaps in the first half Saturday and 2-for-8 on third down. For the second wekk in a row the Wildcats got off to a fast start. They led Central Connecticut, 46-7, at halftime. \"It was really good to see how we came out and played,\" McDonnell said. “One of the things we pride ourselves on defense is playing with energy,” Anderson said. “When we play with energy we play pretty well.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:40:45.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
