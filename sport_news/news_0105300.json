(Photo: Merle Laswell/For the Register) \nThe Bondurant-Farrar volleyball team completed one of their busiest stretches of the season going 4-3 in a stretch of five days last week. \nTuesday saw the Blue Jays down A-D-M, Adel 25-23, 25-22, 25-18 in a tight contest. “It was a real emotional night for us,” BF head coach Ray Sauer said. “We dug the ball well and really kept things going.” Alyssa Scheeler led the way with 25 digs. Logan Farmer had 25 assists and Jessica Noonan had 11 kills. \nIt was a long trip to Boone Thursday, but it was worth it, as the Blue Jays defeated the Toreadors, 25-16, 25-20, 25-22. Scheeler had another solid game going 14-15 serving and had 24 digs. Givanna Vance had 11 kills. \n“It was a good team win. Gia played real well, and Logan really got us going as she always does,” Sauer said. \nThe Blue Jays traveled to Johnston’s tournament on Saturday. They lost a hard-fought match against perennial state power Dike-New Hartford 21-14, 11-21, 10-15. “We were moving the ball, passing, and blocking pretty well,” Sauer said. \nNext, BF fell to an extremely tall Johnston squad 21-11, 21-7. The Blue Jays downed Webster City next 21-11, 21-18. Jessica Noonan was a force behind the line, going 9-9 serving with four aces. Connor Gauch led the team with four kills. \nThe outstanding serving continued as BF downed Greene County 25-6, 25-12. Abby Burris was 15-15 serving with five aces. “Abby really got on a sweet run, serving the ball,” Sauer said. “It was a good serving match for us overall.” Buy Photo Bondurant-Farrar's Jessica Noonan (9) and ADM's Tania Telford (7) smile as they are introduced on Tuesday, October 13, 2015, during a volleyball game between Bondurant-Farrar and ADM.
