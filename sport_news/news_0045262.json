But about an hour before the start of Monday's game against the Toronto Blue Jays, the Rangers announced Beltre will start at third base and bat third. \nThe 36-year-old missed Games 2 and 3 after playing only the first two innings in the opener Thursday before exiting with a strained lower back. \nIn his pregame availability before Beltre was in the lineup, Banister was asked if the third baseman was even a consideration for the game. \n\"I consider Beltre about every second of the game,\" Banister said. \"When Adrian tells me he's ready to go, then obviously we'll make that decision.\" \nAt that point, Beltre was still getting treatment, and Banister said then he was \"not ready to start.\" That changed after Beltre took batting practice inside and did some light running. \nBeltre had also taken soft-toss swings in the batting cage Sunday night, but Bannister said that running was \"most problematic\" for Beltre. \nTexas led the best-of-five series 2-1.
