I don’t know whether his veto will stand up legally.\"\nThere was no immediate response from Honda. McLaren's racing director Eric Boullier would not comment when asked on Friday about the veto.\nThe fact Red Bull have been talking to Honda hints at how desperate they are to find an engine after falling out with Renault over their lack of performance in the V6 turbo hybrid era.\nThey have said they could quit if they cannot find a competitive engine but Honda have been even further behind, with McLaren suffering their worst season and plagued by reliability problems.\nRenault could also still be an option, despite the bad relations, but the French manufacturer has yet to announce its plans for the future despite talk of them taking over Lotus.\nEcclestone said he did not know whether Renault would continue.\n\"You'd have thought they'd have made up their mind before now,\" he said. \"When I spoke to the president (of Renault), he said they would make an announcement in December.\"\nDominant Mercedes have ruled out supplying Red Bull while Ferrari appear willing only to provide them to the former champions' sister team Toro Rosso.\nEcclestone suggested that Red Bull had ended up in their predicament because they mistakenly thought that they had a deal with Mercedes.\n\"In defense of Red Bull, and (principal) Christian Horner in particular, the reason they canceled their agreement with Renault was so they could do the deal which they thought they'd done with Mercedes,\" he said.\nMercedes bosses have said there was never an agreement because Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz never followed up the initial approach.\n(Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Pritha Sarkar)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:04:16.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
