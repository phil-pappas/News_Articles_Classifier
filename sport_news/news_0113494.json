The clock's ticking. This Saturday is different ― perhaps a touch bigger than last week's visit from FCS-level Southern. \nThat's because nobody could've figured Ganus would be in Sanford Stadium at 2:30 p.m. CT. ― not as a player. Just nine months ago and one day earlier, his football team died. A junior in 2014, Ganus was UAB's leading tackler when school president Ray Watts told the team Dec. 2 it would be shut down immediately . \nGanus committed to Georgia a few weeks later and was immediately eligible. But how much would he be able to contribute as a 6-foot-2, 227-pound middle linebacker from Conference USA? Then he had a solid spring and August. By September, Ganus started all four games leading into the Alabama showdown. His 19 tackles ranks sixth on the team. \nSo yeah, this is special. \n\"I never would have imagined that or thought of that,\" Ganus said Tuesday. \"It's been a whirlwind, but to be here and to be in this moment, it's special. I'm really looking forward to it and I just hope I'll play the best game. I'll give everything I've got.\" \nSo far, his biggest games came in the two SEC meetings on Georgia's September schedule. A six-tackle performance at Vanderbilt was followed by a seven-stop afternoon against South Carolina. After beating the Gamecocks 52-20 on Sept. 19, Ganus made national headlines by proposing to girlfriend Peyton Thomas at midfield in Sanford Stadium. \nSo yeah, this is going well. \nA Chelsea High School graduate, Ganus is also the only Alabama import on the Bulldog roster. There are 14 from Georgia who play for the Tide. Before moving to Shelby County at 14, Ganus grew up in Alpharetta, Ga. Jake Ganus impact from UAB to UGA Jake Ganus impact from UAB to UGA \nHe didn't follow the crowd in terms of team allegiances. \n\"I don't want to say I was a fair-weather fan, but I liked Michigan,\" he said. \"I went through a Michigan phase when I was younger, I don't know why.\" \nA quarterback who played defense at Chelsea High, the big-time scholarships never came. He had offers from the Air Force Academy, Naval Academy and UAB, according to the recruiting services . A starter all three years, Ganus lead the Blazers in tackles as a sophomore (93) and junior (70). Walking through campus supplied a quick reminder of the state of football in Birmingham. \n\"I mean, it was tough,\" he said. \"A lot of your students were Alabama or Auburn fans. It was tough but we had our fan base and like I said I was neutral in that rivalry so I was able to be a Blazer for a couple of years.\" \nGanus said he never heard from Alabama in high school or after the Blazer program shuttered. \n\"I don't know how it would have looked for them to have picked up a UAB kid,\" he said. \"I don't know if that's what they were thinking or anything like that. I couldn't be any happier to be here so I don't even think about that.\" \nGeorgia, on the other hand, had a real need for an experienced middle linebacker. Coach Mark Richt noted his football smarts. \n\"I was impressed with just how quickly he learned what to do and how quickly he's been in position to help guys get lined up,\" Richt said. \"He's not afraid to communicate out there.\" Jake Ganus 12.02.2014 Watch what UAB junior Jake Ganus had to say after learning the Blazers' football program was being shut down. \nFullback Quayvon Hicks took it a step further calling Ganus the quarterback of the defense. He knows the stakes for his new senior classmate. \n\"It's probably going to mean a lot more to him being a home state than it means to others, but as a team collectively, we have to focus in knowing it's not going to be an easy battle,\" Hicks said. \"We have to understand this is SEC football, just like any other week.\" \nGanus still hears from some of his UAB coaches. He last spoke with head coach Bill Clark in July since both have been a little busy since. Clark is relaunching the UAB program that was reinstated June 1 . \n\"I'm glad they're bringing it back,\" Ganus said. \"I'm happy for them. I think Birmingham deserves a football team and I look forward to them having a good future.\" \nThe present isn't so bad for Ganus. \nSo yeah, things have worked out since that day last December when his football program dissolved. \n\"It's been a roller coaster but it's been all good since I got here,\" Ganus said. \"It's been an uphill ride. So it's been awesome. Every experience I've had since I've gotten here has been awesome. These fans, coaches and teammates have been awesome.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:13:45.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
