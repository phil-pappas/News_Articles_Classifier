We've got to move on and keep trusting in each other that we're going to get the job done ... We can't get caught up on mistakes that we made in that game. We've got to move on and look at Kent State and get ready to beat them.\" \n[ ALSO READ: UMass vs. Kent State: Five keys to the game plus final score prediction ] \nBlake Frohnapfel, who's under more pressure than anyone else when it comes to pulling the Minutemen out of their rut, said players came into the new week upset at themselves: \n\"I think for us, guys were kind of pissed off a little bit. We felt disappointed in our execution last game. Guys went out there with a chip on their shoulder because of the way we were playing and the way we were attacking our scout teams. I think that's the way it should be.\" \nFrohnapfel, most of the time at least, is a happy, upbeat kind of guy. But sometimes even he has to hunker down and get a little angry when things aren't going smoothly: \n\"Definitely. It has to be done sometimes. If execution's not there, that's one thing. But if guys aren't giving effort, that's another thing. I think today, with the way they're running around, I think guys are excited to be here and excited for the opportunity this week.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:30:22.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
