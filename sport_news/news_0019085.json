(AP) - A Dartmouth alumnus and his family are offering to match up to $5 million toward rebuilding the college's 77-year-old lodge in the White Mountains.\nThe Moosilauke Ravine Lodge about 45 miles northeast of Hanover in Warren was built in 1938. It is the end destination of Dartmouth's First-Year Trips program, hosting more than 90 percent of every incoming class, and is used for orientation programs for the college's medical and business schools.\nGeorge \"Skip\" Battle, a 1966 graduate, will match all contributions toward the rebuilding project made between now and June 30 up to $5 million. The project is expected to cost $17 million, with construction beginning next September.\nBattle is a senior fellow at the Aspen Institute and former CEO of Ask.com.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:42:22.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
