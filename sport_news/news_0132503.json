The Seattle Seahawks might have to play on Monday night without the heart and soul of their offense, as running back Marshawn Lynch is reportedly “60-40 not playing.”\nAdChoices This figure comes by way of Pro Football Talk , citing a source.\nShould Lynch not be able to take the field for the nationally televised Monday Night Football game on ESPN, then it will likely fall to rookie running back Thomas Rawls out of Central Michigan to carry the load.\nHe took full advantage of his opportunity in Week 3 when it became clear Lynch’s hamstring injury was hindering him badly. Rawls rushed for 104 yards on 16 carries in relief and looked very much like he belongs in the NFL.\nIt’s a long season, and Seattle would be wise to let Lynch take a page out of the Buffalo Bills’ playbook by letting the veteran back rest up until he’s 100-percent healthy.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "https://twitter.com/ProFootballTalk/status/650353714658693120", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://sportsnaut.com/2015/10/lesean-mccoy-im-not-playing-until-im-100-percent/"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T08:40:59.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
