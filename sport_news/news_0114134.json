But the discarded India opener seemed to have crossed the limit on Saturday. Not only did the Delhi skipper engage in an ugly argument with rival Bengal captain Manoj Tiwary in their Ranji Trophy match here, he also pushed on-fielder umpire Krishnaraj Srinath.\nThe incident happened in the eighth over of Bengal's second innings when Tiwary came in to bat at No. 4. Tiwary, who was wearing a cap, asked for his helmet as soon as he realised pacer Sumit Narwal will come on from the other end.\nHe stopped Manan Sharma while he was about to bowl, and signaled his Bengal teammate in the dressing room to get his helmet. Manan thought it was a tactic to delay play, and the two players engaged in verbal volleys.\nGambhir, who was standing at first slip, then lost his cool and approached Tiwary angrily, hurling abusive words.\nThe Bengal skipper also reacted angrily and even showed his bat to Gambhir. The two players nearly came to exchanging blows when on-field umpires Srinath and C Nandan intervened.\nSrinath tried to cool Gambhir down, but Gambhir pushed the umpire while trying to move towards Tiwary.\nGambhir was heard telling Tiwary: \"Tu baahar mil match ke baad, tujhe maaroonga (Meet me after the match, I'll hit you) and aaj tu gaya (you are finished today).\"\nTiwary also retaliated, saying: \"Abhi baahar chal na (Let's go out now) and aa maar na, (come, hit me).\"\nIn the end, Tiwary relented after Nandan took him to the other corner, but Gambhir continued with his abusive language.\nAfter stumps, both Gambhir and Tiwary were called for a personal hearing by match referee Valmik Buch.\n\"I have huge respect for Gambhir for whatever he has done for the country. But today, he crossed all limits by making some personal comments. I was really shocked to hear that. I did not start it at all,\" Tiwary told reporters after the end of play.\nGambhir issued a statement, saying: \"At no point did I threaten or push any on-field umpires. Nor did I threaten to beat Manoj up. In fact, I attended match referee's hearing post the day's play where he accepted that he doesn't have any video evidence of me pushing the umpire. On the contrary, the match referee conceded he had video evidence where Manoj is seen pushing Pradeep Sangwan.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:14:42.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
