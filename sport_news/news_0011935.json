In the team’s final home game of the preseason, coach Lionel Hollins said he wanted to give his main guys significant minutes together.\n\"We’re going to play it straight,\" Hollins said. \"And see what we have with the people that we think are the core people.\"\nAnd what the Nets have, still, is a massive question mark of a team.\nThe good? The Nets were able to beat the Sixers, 92-91. There were decent stretches of offense and signs of defensive improvement. The bad? The Nets were wildly inconsistent, on both ends of the floor, against a Philadelphia team that is expected to be one of the worst in the league.\n\"We’ve got a lot of stuff to work on, still,\" said Thaddeus Young, who scored 15 points.\nHollins said he hasn’t set his starting lineup for the regular season. But in Sunday’s trial performance, he went with Brook Lopez, Thaddeus Young, Joe Johnson, Wayne Ellington and Jarrett Jack.\nBojan Bogdanovic and Shane Larkin were the first men off the bench. Thomas Robinson also played significant minutes and will likely be part of the rotation.\nIt’s unclear the fate of Justin Harper and rookie Rondae Hollis-Jefferson.\nHarper, a 26-year-old journeyman forward, scored 10 points in 17 minutes and could be in position to make the team after an impressive preseason; with Andrea Bargnani (hamstring) and Willie Reed (thumb) out, the Nets are in sore need of front court depth. Hollis-Jefferson, the 23rd overall pick in the June draft, missed Wednesday’s preseason game because of a sprained ankle. He played 12 minutes Sunday, because Hollins wanted to get him up to speed.\n\"He played fine,\" Hollins said of Hollis-Jefferson, who scored two points with three assists and two rebounds. \"I don’t know if he’s part of the rotation or not, but he played fine.\"\nSergey Karasev, Donald Sloan, Dahntay Jones, Ryan Boatright and Quincy Miller did not play. Hollins said they were all healthy enough to play, but did not; meaning, seemingly, that they’re presently out of the rotation. Hollins said the Nets will \"shuffle the deck\" for today’s preseason finale in Boston.\nThe Nets who played were inconsistent. Brooklyn gave up 30 first-quarter points to the Sixers — continuing a trend of poor preseason defense. But from that point forward, they improved.\n\"We’re still figuring things out — especially defensively,\" said Brook Lopez, who scored 24 points. \"We definitely adjusted. We saw what we needed to do.\"\nIn the third quarter, the Nets built a 14-point lead. It didn’t last, and Hollins had to bring his starters back into the game in the final minutes, to preserve the win. The Nets did it. And while there’s still much work to be done, Hollins admitted he sees \"a pinhead [of] light at the end of the tunnel.\"\nEmail: vasqueza@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:37:18.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
