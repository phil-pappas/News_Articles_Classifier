The fiscal impact to local governments is unknown but could include a loss in tax revenues from electric utility suppliers and potential litigation costs.\nThe petition, which would amend Chapter 393 of the Revised Statutes of Missouri, was submitted by Mike Grimes, 8019 Gannon Ave., University City, MO 63130.\nBefore any statutory changes can be brought before Missouri voters in the November 2016 election, signatures must be obtained from registered voters equal to five (5) percent of the total votes cast in the 2012 governor's election from six of the state's eight congressional districts.\nSignatures on behalf of all initiative petitions for the 2016 ballot are due to the secretary of stateâ€™s office by no later than 5 p.m. on May 8, 2016.\nBefore circulating petitions, state law requires that groups must first have the form of their petition approved by the secretary of state and attorney general. The secretary of state then prepares a summary statement of no more than 100 words, and the state auditor prepares a fiscal impact statement, both of which are subject to the approval of the attorney general. When both statements are approved, they become the official ballot title.", "external_links": ["http://s1.sos.mo.gov/CMSImages/Elections/Petitions/2016-088.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-21T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:54:34.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
