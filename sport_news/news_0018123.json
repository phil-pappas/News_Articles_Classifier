Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 5:05 PM Updated at 5:09 PM Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 5:05 PM Updated at 5:09 PM BESSEMER CITY — At age 26, Phillip Russ has already seen and done a lot with high school-aged sports. He’s about to experience even more. A two-sport athlete at Burns who continued his football career at Catawba, Russ also played for a state champion Cherryville American Legion Post 100 baseball squad. He was on the staff of a Salisbury High football team that won a state title and has coached at smaller schools (West Lincoln) as well as larger ones (Carson, Fayetteville Jack Britt). He has been involved with football, basketball, softball and baseball. Now Russ takes the helm of the Bessemer City Yellow Jackets’ baseball program. The announcement was made Thursday by the school administration. “I’m thankful for the opportunity,” the Bessemer City science teacher said. “I hope we can bring the buzz back to the nest.” Russ takes over a once-proud program that hasn’t had a winning season since 2010. “Several of the top pitchers have graduated, but there’s seven or eight players returning and a lot of freshman who are eager,” Russ said. “I think they’re hungry. The big thing for me is their hustle. “It’s about their work ethic and repetitions. I remember when I played, there were things you could do right in your own yard, those reps, to make yourself better. You’ve got to do those things when no one is looking, that’s what builds character.” Russ had been influenced by a number of his former coaches in his athletic journey. “My Catawba football coach, Larry Hester, always said it’s about being fast, being physical and first class,” Russ said. “And I think that goes for all sports. If you does those things, people will respect you. “Then, from (football) coach Ron Greene at Burns, he believed in tenacity, having heart. You didn’t let your pride get in the way of doing what you were supposed to.” His former legion coach Bobby Reynolds, also made an impact. “He could take all these personalities from different schools, bring them all together going for a common goal,” Russ said. “He also brought that aggressiveness to what we were doing.” Russ sees himself as a “players’ coach.” “Some coaches develop their scheme and try to piece the kids in it,” he said. “I think you develop your approach from the kids you have and what they can bring to it. You have to let the kids know you’re there for them. The goal is to put them into college and develop good young people.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:11:57.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
