Ron Wolf took Terrell Buckley and many Packers fans never got over it. Did you want to play in Green Bay? And be honest – this was 1992. Miami was a lot better option.\nA . At the age of 20, I was just dreaming of playing pro ball, and frankly, hoping my name got called on draft day. To play in Green Bay would have been like playing in Philadelphia, both feel like home. The player rarely stays in the same state where he plays his college ball, but it all worked out.\nQ. What exactly is your role as NFL vice president of football operations?\nA. My role in football operations is to protect the integrity and competitive fairness of the professional sport of football. There are several aspects to that, such as establishing a culture of clarity, consistency and credibility to players, coaches, clubs and fans in order to develop the future player, preserve and innovate the game.\nBeyond that, our goal is to provide a world-class game-day experience for players, coaches and fans through innovation and proactively meeting the demands and challenges of the game and its players.\nQ. What is a typical day, week, month for you on the job? Who do you report your findings to?\nA . Football operations is focused on the football side of the business of football. Each week there are certain tasks relating to the game—reviewing plays, for example, making sure that officiating is consistent, player safety is maintained and that competitive equity is ensured. My reporting begins with my colleagues in Football Operations and also to the Commissioner's executive team.\nQ. The rules of the game have changed. What do you say when people tell you they miss those old ugly hits?\nA. Our number one priority is protecting the player from unnecessary risk. We do this using rules, technique, science, research and technology. We are seeing steady progress year in and year out in making the game safer, not softer. Last year hits on defenseless players were down 68% and unnecessary roughness penalties were down 26%. Over the past three regular seasons, concussions were down 25%. This is not by accident. We have met with and educated both players and coaches about rules and technique. Both the coaches and the players are adjusting.\nWe can still see the same, old-fashioned competitive games and rivalries where the drama of perseverance, tenacity, and skill play out on the gridiron. These are all elements that make professional football a world-class entertainment experience.\nQ. When did you think you'd work for the league? What would you be doing if not doing this?\nA . Beginning in high school, I thought about sports as a way to accelerate my life's purpose. Sport offers so many values and skills that can be transferred from the field to the boardroom. We learn life lessons of work ethics to perseverance to time management to competition to knowing and understanding and getting along with those who are different from ourselves. Sport is a tremendous avenue to learn about yourself and to attain success in life.\nWorking for the NFL seemed like a natural progression. It's a great blessing to have moved from being a participant to a contributor to our game. There is great opportunity as a former player to have influence with the younger, current players as well as those who have transitioned from the game. Football creates brotherhood and transcends race, age, gender and other elements of society. It is wonderful to have played the game in the past and to contribute now to its future.\nQ. Have you kept any ties to Wisconsin Badgers?\nA. Once a Badger, always a Badger. Yes, I stay in touch and believe Coach Chryst is working hard to win another conference championship. My daughter attended Wisconsin and I have a son who is being recruited as a 2018 prospect, which also keeps us as a family watching Badger football. Also, I keep in constant contact with my classmates from Wisconsin, particularly Duer Sharp, who is Commissioner of Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC).\nThe 1991 season was Coach Alvarez's second year and we began hitting a stride as he built his program and installed his system. We were 5-6 that year improving from a 1-10 season in 1988.\nQ. What did you like about NFLPA role? Specific duties there?\nA. It was an honor and privilege during my playing experience to serve the players--past, present and future. The brotherhood, the way that we compete, yet care for one another, the lifelong relationships were all part of being a labor leader. These bonds inspired the job of ensuring safety of the player, improving working conditions, wages and hours.\nIt has been a great blessing in my life to have experienced football as a player, as a labor leader, and now as part of the league's front office.\nQ. Can you stay connected to the game from the level of the fans?\nA. Our fans and players drive our sport. The voice of the fan is paramount and I am in daily contact with our fans.\nQ. If you could change anything, what would it be?\nA. We are constantly working to make the game better. We want our fans to have the very best experience football offers. To accomplish this, it starts with our personnel—front office, coaches, players, officials, trainers, medical staff—those involved with the game must be the best that they can be both on and off the field. Improvement continues as we adopt new technology to make the game safer, not softer, and more engaging. In short, we don't stand still. There is a continuum of change in football as we borrow from Coach Lombardi's playbook in chasing perfection, hoping to catch excellence.\nQ. How do you feel about diversity in the league's decision-making positions?\nA. A new paradigm must be established where trust is foundational as we look at the 21st Century social justice system. We must move beyond traditional historic concepts of leveling the playing field and equal opportunity toward developing human capital and occupational mobility from the perspective of good business sense and individual enterprise. When we look at diversity it often focuses on race. Diversity's success, however, cannot be solely dependent upon issues of color. Diversity and inclusion is the essence of a person's character, gifting, best qualities, and how these distinguishing characteristics advance ideas. Our inclusion thought must also extend to religion, gender, sexual orientation, disabilities, and age to frame diversity and inclusion as a 21st Century movement.. We must advance our efforts in occupational mobility with an organic 21st Century ideal of diversity and inclusion as good business, a moral and just system embracing best practices, and shared responsibility from both employee and employer.\nOur vision must be to establish best practices and processes to develop, introduce and promote an atmosphere that establishes trust across all aspects of hiring actions. Diversity and inclusion should reflect good business and value-based leadership.\nWe have been working diligently to improve hiring practices at the club level through our Career Development Advisory Panel comprised of former head coaches and general managers. This panel has sought to reduce and eliminate subjective criteria in choosing high performing prospects and to develop best practices that clubs can employ in determining their hires. We also assist prospects through the Bill Walsh Minority Coaching Fellowship, the Nunn-Wooten Scouting Fellowship, and in working with the NCAA on coaching academies.\nQ. Would you rather this be a non-issue, where color is a non-factor? Or is it very or somewhat important to you to hold your title and also serve as a role model of sorts?\nA. Race or gender alone should not be the basis for advancement in a corporate setting, and sometimes just because an individual is credentialed on paper doesn't mean they qualify. What should be at the root of gainful employment is a solid work ethic, which is, oftentimes, developed at childhood through perseverance or a healthy competitive environment. Work ethic collocates diversity and qualification.\nI look at the heart of the man and the heart of the woman. Do you care? I look for people who care, people who are much smarter than I am. But bring a different perspective and add a different type of value than I can bring.\n ", "external_links": ["http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/JSI/RWS/jsonline.com/CAI/335393051/E/prod/PC/Basic/AT/A"], "published": "2015-10-22T09:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:09:43.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
