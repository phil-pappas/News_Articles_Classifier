It has in the past conducted missile tests in defiance of international warnings and sanctions.\nThe US Missile Defense Agency said in March North Korea could achieve the ability to launch an intercontinental ballistic missile this year.\nOn Wednesday, Gortney said the US military was investing to modernise its current missile defence system, add new sensors and radars to better identify potential missile launches, and drive down the cost of defending against such attacks.\nHe warned that the failure of the US Congress to pass a budget for fiscal year 2016, or a resumption of mandatory budget cuts, could jeopardise the funding needed for such efforts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:48:19.726+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
