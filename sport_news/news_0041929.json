Starter Eric Kahn was benched against Baylor in favor of Ruben Guzman, who only managed 30 yards per punt on his two attempts. \n“If I said there was an area of disappointment for me, personally for me, it's that area,” Beaty said. “We have not flipped the field from that punt game perspective, and we've got to continue to get better.” \nBeaty is willing to consider all options. A new punter from campus, Michael Valentine, was added to the depth chart this week. The Blue Valley North graduate went through his first practice Monday after KU cleared him through its compliance department. \n“He kicks the ball pretty good. Not great, but pretty good,” Beaty said. “I've only seen him one day.” \nBeaty said Valentine wouldn’t be ready to compete for the job Saturday against Texas Tech, but he wouldn’t rule out the freshman challenging for the spot in the weeks to come. \nKahn, a 6-foot-5 senior, has struggled to get distance. Going back to the 2000 season, his 34.4-yard average ranks sixth-worst out of 1,877 Division I punters with at least 25 attempts. It’s also on pace to be the worst average for a punter since 2012. \n“We've got to do a better job of keeping the ball in play and minimizing those short punts that create shanks,” Beaty said. “Those are big-time momentum swings in games when you see that.” \nBeaty accepts blame for the special teams’ failures as well. \n“For us to put the amount of time into it and the production that we're getting, you know, I think that says that we as coaches have got to look inside,” Beaty said. “We've got to look at ourselves in the mirror and say, ‘Hey, man, are we doing something wrong? Are we doing something that we've got to get better at?’ It's not always just those players' fault.” \nKU also has had issues on kickoff returns. The Jayhawks rank 102nd nationally with an 18.5-yard average, and take away a Ryan Schadler 91-yard return for touchdown in the opener, and that average would drop to 14.7. \n“Believe me, we're turning over every rock,” Beaty said of his special teams, “making sure we put those guys in the best position.” \nINJURY UPDATE — Beaty reported Tuesday that quarterback Montell Cozart, receiver Bobby Hartzog, defensive end Damani Mosby and defensive tackle Jacky Dezir would be out for Saturday’s game. The coach was optimistic that receiver Tre’ Parmalee, center Keyon Haughton and cornerback Brandon Stewart would be able to return after missing last week’s 66-7 loss to Baylor. \nBeaty also said receiver Joshua Stanford was battling a hamstring injury that had limited him in previous weeks. \nHIGH PRAISE — Beaty will coach Saturday against Texas Tech’s Kliff Kingsbury, who hired Beaty as receivers coach when he was offensive coordinator at Texas A&M in 2012. \n“He's such a good looking dude. That's kind of something people talk about all the time,” Beaty said with a smile. “But, man, if you knew this guy, I don't know if I know five humans better than Kliff Kingsbury. I really don't. ... He's a hard working, quiet, needs-no-applause guy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:26:32.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
