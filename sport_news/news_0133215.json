You know, we don't influence them in that direct way,\" he said. \"But many of those clubs obviously want to attract our championship, the PGA Championship, the Women's PGA Championship, things like the Ryder Cup, and we have very clear rules that we won't bring any of our events, let along our marquee events ... to clubs that don't have a very open membership roster. That's one of the fundamental tenets of who we are.\" \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:49:38.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
