Photo: Twitter\nIf you've ever spent time in the US, you'd know that the American diet has a unique propensity for mixing sweet and savoury.\nMaple syrup-covered omelettes. Chocolate covered bacon. Any way to ruin a decent meal with loads of fructose is considered plausible.\nBut even by American standards, baseball's Texas Rangers have pushed the boundary with the newest addition to their game-day menu.\nTo celebrate their qualification for the playoffs after clinching the American League West - and perhaps in an effort to trump the heart disease-inducing offerings introduced at some football stadiums this season - the Rangers have released some intriguing concession-stand items that defy all rules of culinary decency.\nAdvertisement Heading the list of sugar-coated madness is the 'sweet spot candy dog' which - and it's hard to even write this - features a hot dog drowned in cotton candy-infused mustard and cotton candy. Cotton candy is the American name for fairy floss.\nOther insane menu introductions include the Elvis Jabberdog Brownie: a 60-centimetre brownie rolled in a Rice Krispy crust, dipped in cake batter, fried and topped, of course, with whipped cream.\nThere is also the the \"One-Pound Top-N-Go Cheetos,\" a half-kilogram bag of Cheetos opened on its side and loaded with taco meat and topped with nacho cheese on offer for those with a strong constitution.\nNew @Rangers games: Hot dog w/mac & cheese or mashed potatoes, topped w/brisket, chili or shredded chicken pic.twitter.com/5U5f5sQhXf\n— Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) October 5, 2015 For Postseason Home Games: The @Rangers will sell a hot dog w/cotton candy-infused mustard, topped w/cotton candy pic.twitter.com/No7V4iufdC\n— Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) October 5, 2015 New for @Rangers games: A 2-foot long brownie in Rice Krispies crust, dipped in funnel cake batter & fried pic.twitter.com/usiE9n9AEY\n— Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) October 5, 2015", "external_links": ["http://t.co/5U5f5sQhXf", "https://twitter.com/darrenrovell/status/651039527788744704", "http://t.co/usiE9n9AEY", "https://twitter.com/Rangers", "https://twitter.com/darrenrovell/status/651032035985891328", "http://t.co/No7V4iufdC", "https://twitter.com/darrenrovell/status/651038902128640000"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:35:08.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
