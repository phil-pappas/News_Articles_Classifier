The game ended after the Sun’s deadline. \nLast season, Geekie played nine games with the Americans, notching a pair of assists. When he was returned to the Yellowhead Chiefs, he led the team in scoring with 27 goals and 36 assists in 44 games and was named to the Manitoba AAA Midget Hockey League’s first all-star team. \nHe also played a pair of games with the Neepawa Natives of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League, scoring a goal and adding an assist, before finishing his season with two post-season appearances with the Americans. This fall, he returned to Kennewick, Wash., a better player. \n“I think I got a little bit stronger over the summer and a little bit quicker,” Geekie said. “Just learning and adapting to new things in the league has helped me to try and solidify a spot. I just have to keep working.” \nHe was originally selected in the fifth round of the 2013 WHL bantam draft by the Americans. Geekie first played with the Americans on March 16, 2014, two days after signing with the team as a 15-year-old, scoring in his debut. \nHe has learned to deal with the transition from being a frontline player in midget to being a third -and fourth-liner in the WHL who occasionally gets a chance to kill penalties. \n“You just have to do what you can,” Geekie said. “Everyone has a role on the team and I think whatever I can bring and whatever they can work with is good enough for me. As long as I’m getting in there and working hard every day I think it will become very positive.” \nGeekie scored his first goal of the season on Wednesday on a broken play, when the puck came up the boards and teammate Michael Rasmussen found him with a long pass. Geekie then put it into the open net. \nHe said the game on Friday will stand out for him, both because it’s against his father Craig’s old team and the fact that he watched the Wheat Kings growing up. \n“It would be nice playing in Brandon close to home but any time you get to play against a hometown team that you grew up watching, it’s very special,” Geekie said. \n» pbergson@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:07:24.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
