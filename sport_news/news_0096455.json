(AP) - “I thought I was going to get killed. I didn’t know what to do,\" said the victim of a violent home invasion in Metairie.\nThe incident happened Oct. 14 at about 8:30 a.m. in the 3500 block of Bissonet Drive. The victim, who still struggles to talk after being severely beaten, said three men claiming to be repairmen knocked on her door.\n“I called my son, and my son talked to one of the guys,” the victim said.\n“She gave her phone to them so that I could speak with them,\" the victim's son said. \"I get on the phone with one of the guys, and I asked him what he was doing. He said, 'we were told to come to this address to do some work,' and I said, 'well maybe you got the wrong address.'”\nAfter getting off the phone, the victim said she tried to close the door, but the three men pushed their way in.\n“That’s when they hit me,\" she said. \"They started punching me and threw me to the floor.”\nShe said the men were screaming \"where’s the money\", as they beat her.\n“There is all kinds of blood in the house from the front door and all through the kitchen,” the victim’s son said.\nThe victim has two roommates, a man and a woman. At the time of the attack, both of them were home. The victim said the woman tried to come to her aid.\n“When I was screaming for help, she came out to help me, and the guy got her to go back in the room. They stayed with her and told her to shut up and don’t talk,” the victim said.\nThe attackers, though, didn’t realize that the victim’s other roommate was hiding in a nearby closet. As they beat her, he dialed 911.\n“If it wasn’t for that individual, the cops wouldn’t have been alerted,\" the victim's son said. \"They wouldn’t have gotten here when they did, and they may have killed my mother, killed the other roommate and got away scott free.”\nInstead, a sheriff’s deputy showed up to investigate while the attackers were still inside.\n“Somebody was knocking at the door, and one guy said, 'it’s the police,'” the victim said.\nDeputies said one of the alleged burglars, Allen Narciss, answered the door and at first pretended to live at the home. The responding deputy quickly realized that was a lie, and the two began to struggle. The deputy tased Narciss, but it didn’t stop him.\nInvestigators say Narciss ran out of the house and jumped into an SUV, dragging the deputy alongside the vehicle before being arrested. The other suspects, Ronald Bowman and Terry McCall Jr., were also arrested.\nThe victim and her son believe she was targeted, but they aren’t exactly sure why. The victim said she may need plastic surgery to repair her face.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
