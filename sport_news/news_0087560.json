(AP) — The Minnesota Vikings have downgraded running back Adrian Peterson to questionable for their game Sunday at Detroit due to an illness. \nPeterson jammed the ring finger on his left hand last week against Kansas City. He was originally listed as probable to play the Lions because of that injury. The illness did not come into play until the Vikings made the announcement Saturday. \nIn 13 career games against the Lions, Peterson has rushed for 90 yards or more 10 times with 11 touchdowns. He’s averaging 5.3 yards per attempt and 107 yards per game against Detroit. \nThe Vikings previously ruled defensive tackle Sharrif Floyd out of the game because of knee and ankle injuries. \n___ \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:25:55.299+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
