We had a couple of events early with the Slam and we wanted a break. It as a good break, but now it will get a little busier.” \nWinning the first Slam of the year right out of the gate was a huge contrast to the turmoil-filled off-season last year. \n“It’s big,” said Koe about his win that’s put him at No. 2 on the World Curling Tour money list. “You usually don’t have a Slam that early in the year. We had a decent year last year, but didn’t have a big win, so to come out and win our first Slam as a team and do it early that’ll just give us confidence for the rest of this year.” \nKoe raised some eyebrows when he gave up a chance to skip the first Team Canada, choosing to go into this Olympic quadrennial with third Marc Kennedy, second Brent Laing and lead Ben Hebert. \n“It’s not something you can put your finger on,” said Koe. “I don’t think it’s any secret a couple of the top teams last year, (Mike) McEwen and (Brad) Jacobs are great teams, but they’ve been together for six-seven years. We’re still learning and we’ll be learning all year. We learned a lot last year and we still have to keep getting better.” \nDespite the hurdles the team faced, they somehow managed to beat the odds and win Alberta. Unfortunately, they finished out of the Brier playoffs with a 6-5 record. \n“We had high expectations at the Brier,” said Koe. “We had a lot of bad luck and things go against us. I was sick for a couple of games. We had a couple of great shots against us to win games.” \nIncluding the one played over and over again on the highlights packages by Brad Gushue. \n“That shot, which is one out of 100, if he misses that one we’re in some kind of tiebreaker or playoff and you never know what could have happened,” said Koe. “It wasn’t our week and we could have done better, for sure.” \nThis is the year that starts counting in the Olympic quadrennial. The team has its eyes squarely focused on nabbing a Canadian Curling Trials spot with a win at the Canada Cup in Grande Prairie late next month. \n“You start your points chase earlier and earlier,” said Koe. “We try not too much to worry about the points. Obviously, it would be nice to win the Canada Cup and get that monkey off your back. The top teams usually find a way to get there.” \nConsidering Kennedy and Hebert were part of the Kevin Martin team that were first one in last go-round, Koe has plenty of experience on his team to draw from. \n“Every one on our team has had a lot of success, especially those two,” said Koe. “For sure, that’s our goal for the first half is win the Canada Cup and take some pressure off.” \nKoe plans to space his season. With more Slams on the schedule, there’s plenty of time for breaks in between. \nKoe already knows he’s coming back to the area in late April for the inaugural Champions Cup in Sherwood Park. \nOnly teams that have won an event are eligible for the Champions Cup. Winning in Newfoundland gave his team entry into that season-ending event. \n“That was the nice thing about winning the first Slam,” said Koe. \nKEEP ON ROCKIN’ \nWhen the first edition of the Direct Horizontal Drilling Fall Classic was announced, it had enough sponsorship backing for a three-year run. \nNow in its third year, the $50,000 World Curling Tour event hosted by the Crestwood Curling Club is not done yet. \n“We’re going to keep going until at least the Olympic year,” said Steven Meadows of the organizing committee. \nThis event has attracted one of the strongest fields in its short history, headlined by Alberta champ Kevin Koe. \nSaskatoon’s Steve Laycock, the 2015 Brier bronze medallist, is also trying his luck this weekend. \n“The field keeps getting stronger every year,” said Meadows. \nAlong with the veteran names, there’s plenty of up-and-coming teams here this weekend. \nFormer world junior champ Brendan Bottcher has had a strong start to his season, qualifying in three spiels, including the season-opening Grand Slam. \nHis early-season performance has placed him solidly in top 10 rankings this season. \nFormer Alberta junior champ Thomas Scoffin is also in the field, along with teams from the United States, Norway, Japan and South Korea. \nAlso here are young Alberta hotshots Charlie Thomas and Brock Virtue, along with Saskatoon’s Shawn Meachem, a surprise winner at the HDF Insurance Shoot-Out at the Saville Centre last month. \nJAYS FEVER \nCurlers, apparently, are also huge Blue Jays fans. \nDuring breaks in the action, curlers like lead Ben Herbert of the Kevin Koe team, came out to the lobby area to get updates on the extra-inning game. \nBetween draws, a while collection of curlers sat in the bleachers with their backs to the ice with their eyes glued to one of the many screens at the curling rink. \nPaying fans sitting in the lounge area were a bit luckier. They could watch both the baseball game and the on-ice action at the same time.
