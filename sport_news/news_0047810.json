The Bears broke that early-season losing streak with a 24-21 home victory over the Oakland Raiders in the fourth game. It’s only coincidence that the Raiders will be headed back to Soldier Field this weekend. But can the Bears again use them as a remedy after their winless September? The Bears remain underdogs. And the Raiders’ confidence is building after convincing wins the last two weeks over the Baltimore Ravens and Cleveland Browns. So what do you need to know about the Raiders? With the aid of Vic Tafur, the Raiders beat writer for the San Francisco Chronicle, here’s your snapshot scouting report.\nLast week: The Raiders rolled up a season-high 469 yards of offense and the defense contributed five sacks and two takeaways to a 27-20 road win over the Browns.\nThe quarterback: Derek Carr’s second season as the Raiders’ starter got off to a bumpy start in Week 1. During a 33-13 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, the 24-year-old quarterback sputtered early and later left the game with a hand injury.\nBut the last two weeks, Carr has shown flashes of being the franchise quarterback the Raiders believe him to be. He threw for a total of 665 yards and five touchdowns in wins over the Ravens and Browns. And for the season, Carr has just one turnover while being sacked only once.\nCarr has a strong arm and obvious football intellect. His older brother David was the No. 1 pick in the 2002 NFL draft and spent 11 seasons in the league, a valuable resource for Derek’s growth in reading and understanding defenses.\nCarr struggled some as a rookie, often too cautious and getting rid of the ball too early. His 5.5 yards per attempt needed improvement and through three games this season has spiked to 8.1. Some of that stems from his heightened confidence in the weapons around him, most notably rookie receiver Amari Cooper.\nBrad Biggs' NFL power rankings: Bears entrenched at bottom Brad Biggs Last week's ranking in parentheses.\n1. Patriots 3-0 (1): Some have already started wondering if they can go 16-0 again. No joke. Their three opponents so far are 5-1 in other games.\n2. Packers 3-0 (2): Made it look easy against a talented Chiefs defense. Too easy.\n3. Broncos 3-0 (4): Crazy to say,...\nLast week's ranking in parentheses.\n1. Patriots 3-0 (1): Some have already started wondering if they can go 16-0 again. No joke. Their three opponents so far are 5-1 in other games.\n2. Packers 3-0 (2): Made it look easy against a talented Chiefs defense. Too easy.\n3. Broncos 3-0 (4): Crazy to say,...\n(Brad Biggs) So far this season: The Raiders offense put it all together the last two weeks, racking up 917 total yards.\nBy all accounts, Cooper has been as good as advertised if not better, tallying 20 catches, 290 yards and one TD through the first three games. Cooper, who was selected with the No. 4 overall pick in this spring’s draft, is not only a polished route runner, he possesses a blend of quickness and savvy that has made him very dangerous after the catch.\nThe Raiders have an impressive array of playmakers besides Cooper. Running back Latavius Murray put up his first 100-yard outing of the season last week with 139 yards on 26 rushes. Michael Crabtree (nine catches, 111 yards in Week 2) continues to be a great complement opposite Cooper.\nIf the Raiders digested a hefty helping of humble pie in their lopsided Week 1 loss, the resulting sickness seems to have helped them. The ability to turn things up a notch against the Ravens, then cross three time zones to win in Cleveland is evidence of a talented team many believe to be on the rise.\nBear Download: Outside linebacker competition The Tribune's Rich Campbell and Dan Wiederer break down the Bears' linebacker situation.\nThe Tribune's Rich Campbell and Dan Wiederer break down the Bears' linebacker situation.\nSee more videos If the Raiders are to be taken seriously, a strong effort against a reeling Bears team is a must.\nThe storylines: Raiders coach Jack Del Rio and Bears coach John Fox are no strangers. Del Rio was Fox’s defensive coordinator in both Carolina (2002) and Denver (2012-14) and was the Broncos’ interim coach for a month in 2013 when Fox was sidelined after heart surgery. So each coach will have some familiarity with the other's personality and tendencies.\nLike Fox, Del Rio has been lauded for establishing a spark and a connection in the Raiders locker room in his first season. For an organization that has made nine head coaching changes in the last 13 years and hasn’t been to the playoffs since losing Super Bowl XXXVII, every little bit of confidence helps. Del Rio's passion has been obvious to players and his track record as a successful player adds to his credibility. He also is in a position to have more input on roster decisions than past Raiders coaches have.\nThe defense: Second-year defensive end Khalil Mack is the energizer, a dynamic playmaker who finished third in NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year voting last season. Mack possesses a combination of strength and quickness that makes him a threat as a pass rusher. He's also a student of the game with an inherent desire to get better.\nMack recorded his first two sacks of the season last week, moved around more than he had in previous weeks and was given some additional freedom to rush from a two-point stance. Mack was an outside linebacker a year ago but was asked by the new Raiders regime to open the season with his hand in the dirt.\nThe Raiders’ pass rush should be the strength of the team. After failing to record a sack in the first two games, they notched five against the Browns. Justin Tuck, in his 11th season remains a threat. The Raiders are also still working to make Aldon Smith a part of their plans. Smith signed a one-year deal last month after being cut by the 49ers following his most recent legal transgression, charged with DUI and hit-and-run in August.\nIf the Raiders exhibit an obvious weakness on defense, it has come in the secondary so far. The Raiders rank 30 th against the pass through three games, allowing 323 yards per game. Last week, they allowed former Bear Josh McCown to throw for 341 yards and two touchdowns.\nThe linebacking corps is also vulnerable in pass coverage. The Raiders have allowed a league-high 305 receiving yards plus five touchdowns by tight ends over the first three games.\nPrivacy Policy Oakland Raiders Chicago Bears Amari Cooper Jack Del Rio Cleveland Browns Baltimore Ravens NFL", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ad514/turbine/ct-biggs-nfl-rankings-spt-0930-20150929", "http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560c87dd/turbine/ct-bears-download-outside-linebacker-video-spt-20150930", "https://twitter.com/VicTafur?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560d3c8a/turbine/ct-behind-enemy-lines-20151001"], "published": "2015-10-01T17:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:11:11.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
