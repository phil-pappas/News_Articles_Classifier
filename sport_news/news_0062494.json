Ground was broken on Tuesday. \nThe facility will have a 3,400-seat basketball arena and a 500-seat volleyball venue along with offices, locker rooms, meeting rooms, training rooms and fan areas. It's expected to be finished by September 2017. \nWofford currently plays basketball in the Benjamin Johnson Arena. It is to be used for intramural competitions and other campus recreational activities once the new facility is built. \nThe new building will be adjacent to Gibbs Stadium, where the Terriers play football. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:14:58.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
