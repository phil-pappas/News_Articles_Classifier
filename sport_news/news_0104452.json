Comment By Lenny Megliola/Special to the News Milford Daily News By Lenny Megliola/Special to the News Posted Oct. 18, 2015 at 9:00 PM By Lenny Megliola/Special to the News Posted Oct. 18, 2015 at 9:00 PM You’d think that Gus Saint-Fort would be bummed out on school days, getting up at 5:20 “on the dot” at his Hyde Park home to catch the METCO bus to Wellesley High. He sets the alarm, but usually wakes up by his own body clock. After all, this has been the sophomore’s routine since third grade. He’ll normally get home around 7 p.m. Then, “dinner, homework, sleep,” he said. That’s the numbing routine. He seems to be thriving in it, especially on the football field. Pretty impressive for a kid who didn’t fall into football until eighth grade. “He came out of nowhere,” said Raiders’ head coach Jesse Davis. “For a sophomore lineman going both ways and being successful, Gus has been a special player.” It’s at defensive tackle that the 5-feet-11, 255-pound Saint-Fort thrives. “I like to make tackles and sacks,” he said. Nothing fancy here. His breakout game came against powerhouse Walpole, a team Wellesley hadn’t beaten in 19 years. Saint-Fort had five tackles for losses and a sack, a good day’s work right there. But he underlined his day by blocking an extra point. Final: Wellesley 7, Walpole 6. He credits the blocking of his linemates for clearing the path for him on that game-deciding extra point try. “I had free reign,” he said. “I could see I could make the block. I got it clean, with two hands.” When he was on the freshman team, he blocked a Needham field goal attempt and an extra point against Framingham. So there was a little history here. Saint-Fort may have come late to the sport, but one thing was clear when he was on the freshman team last season (he got a little varsity playing time). “I was the fastest lineman on the team,” he said. “The coaches just said, ‘Go after the kid with the ball.’ And that was it.” Saint-Fort made up for lost time last summer. “He didn’t miss a workout all summer. He made football a priority,” said Davis. “He’s a tough kid who gets off the ball (fast). He’s doing that instinctively. He’s everything you want in a two-way lineman. The upperclassmen feed off his fire and intensity.” Truth be told, Saint-Fort’s mother didn’t want him to play football. So he gravitated to basketball and soccer. He’d play one-on-one backyard hoops against his twin brother Everson. “He won most of the time,” said Gus. Everson attends Burke High School in the city. Page 2 of 2 - Saint-Fort also wrestles, but it was football he longed for. He liked the physicality. “I’d watch the Boston College and Patriots games on TV, and I knew I wanted to hit like that.” Like he hit in the Walpole game. “Everything just clicked for Gus the week of the Walpole game,” said Davis. So much so that the coach used Saint-Fort just on defense to keep him fresh. “It was a good decision, even though I wanted to be on the field the whole game” Saint-Fort said. The undefeated Raiders are aiming to not just winning the league title, but advancing through the playoffs and winding up in the Super Bowl. “We’re going to Gillette (Stadium),” said Saint-Fort. The Pats’ home field is the site of most of the high school Super Bowls. Saint-Fort owes a lot to Davis, who sometimes drove him home after summer workouts in the high school weight room. On the field Davis helped Saint-Fort with his lineman’s stance, and encouraged him to stick with wrestling because the stance is similar. “It really helps me get into my (football) stance,” Saint-Fort said. The 15-year-old city kid has endured the dreary bus rides and long days in suburbia for almost 10 years, but the rewards are coming. “It’s really fine now. I’m used to it.” It may take Raiders’ opponents a lot longer to get used to Gus Saint-Fort. Lenny Megliola can be reached at lennymegs@aol.com. Follow him on Twitter @lennymegs.
