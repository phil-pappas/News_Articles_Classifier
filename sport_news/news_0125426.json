He apologized Monday to the entire Rutgers community , ahead of Saturday’s game at Indiana. \nThe school has hired outside counsel to put together a report investigating whether the football program committed any NCAA violations. \nRutgers declined a request to make Board of Governors chairperson Greg Brown and Rutgers president Robert Barchi available for interview. Brown seldom grants media interviews, while Barchi more commonly answers questions after board meetings. Kyle Flood knows 'What have you done for me lately' nature of coaching \nRutgers academic oversight chair Carl Kirschner presented the athletics committee a review of the academic performance of student-athletes through cumulative and academic year GPAs from 2005 through 2015 and APR scores, according to Schmidt. \nAthletics director Julie Hermann, associate athletic director in charge of fundraising Sarah Baumgartner, chief marketing officer Geoff Brown and chief financial officer Janine Purcaro also met with the committee. \nRutgers athletics fundraising through the first quarter of the fiscal year is up by about 17 percent over last year, according to Schmidt. \nThe Rutgers-Ohio State football game at 8 p.m. Oct. 24 at High Point Solutions Stadium is a sellout, Schmidt said. \nHermann updated the committee on “where athletics is as it relates to pending facilities in the overall physical master plan” and progress made in Title IX compliance, Schmidt said. \nPurcaro provided an update on the outlook for the fiscal year budget, including the impact cost-of-attendance stipends will have on the budget going forward, according to Schmidt. \nStaff Writer Ryan Dunleavy: rdunleavy@gannettnj.com 1 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1RIPJ4P TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:27:49.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
