RSL is 8-3-1 in league play in 2015 when Morales scores or assists, and 11-3-1 across all competitions when he's on the scoresheet.\n  Without him? RSL is 1-5-2 in league play.\n\"He takes so much upon his shoulders,\" defender Tony Beltran said. \"That's the man he is, that's how he plays; also since he's so steady, he's rarely out. It's a hard adjustment.\"\nIs RSL too reliant on the radiance of its 35-year-old star?\nSome would argue yes, that the 1-0 loss in San Jose missed that connectivity between the back four and the front line. That it missed the calming influence Morales brings to a match when RSL is under the microscope. That even in the CONCACAF Champions League match against Santa Tecla FC on Sept. 24, RSL had a flurry of chances and couldn't bury the El Salvadorian side until Morales came on, provided two assists before straining his hip flexor.\n\"You rely on the big-time players, you need those guys to come through and you need to have everyone else know their role,\" RSL coach Jeff Cassar said. \"Obviously he's a big, big part of our team. I think we maybe lose a hair of confidence, that we can't continue to play the way we want to [without Morales].\"\nThe Morales Renaissance remains in full swing. His eight goals and 11 assists lead the team. Throughout league play, U.S. Open Cup and Champions League, Morales has 10 goals and 13 assists, and he's more often than not the one delivering that perfect pass or cooly finishing a scoring chance.\nCraig Waibel doesn't think RSL is in a unique position when Morales is out. Every team with an effective No. 10-style midfielder is different and arguably less fluid without that caliber of player on the field.\n\"You're placing a lot of belief and trust in certain positions of players — that's the nature of the beast,\" RSL's general manager said. \"These are highly-effective players. Is there a better balance? Trying to figure that out.\"\nCompensating for a player who accounts for nearly 55 percent of your offensive output? Morales' status at Colorado on Sunday is questionable, but he is expected to travel.\nMidseason acquisitions such as Luis Silva and Burrito Martinez have the capabilities to replace Morales and both played in his central role last weekend in San Jose. But Morales is, as Beltran said after the loss to the Earthquakes, irreplaceable.\n\"We don't want to see the dip in performance when we lose one guy, regardless of who that one guy is,\" Waibel said.\nBehind the eight-ball, RSL has no time to dwell on what-ifs or maybes this weekend in Commerce City, Colo. If Morales starts, RSL is guaranteed to be more efficient. If not, the players will be tasked with counteracting the amount of skill they're missing once again.\n\"It's not one person replacing him — it's everyone needing to step up their game just five [or] 10 percent more to cover what we're missing,\" Cassar said.\n\nckamrani@sltrib.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:17:58.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
