Her 438 kills in 2015 have nearly tripled that of her closest teammate while averaging 4.8 per game. \nLast year’s Times-Herald Offensive Player of the Year also leads the Lady Lions on defense with 275 digs while showcasing her versatility this year. \nBut Hayes knows it will take a team effort in order for Trinity Christian to stay on top. The Lady Lions will have to play the role of “underdog” after finishing second in a strong Region 1-AAA alignment in between champion Oak Mountain and third-seeded Heritage School. The trio comprised 3/4ths of last year’s GISA Semifinals before Trinity held off OMA in the finals. \nTwo of Trinity’s four losses this season, though, have come against Oak Mountain (23-3), with the others coming against Community Christian and GHSA Class AAAA fifth-ranked Sandy Creek. \nHeading into this year’s state tournament on Oct. 23-24 again at Heritage, Oak Mountain will get a first round bye, while Trinity and Heritage enter as the No. 2 and No. 3 seeds. \n“We can definitely do it. I know we can,” said Hayes. “As a team, we’ve never let the whole state thing get to our heads. We know that we’re capable of being beat. We’ve had a really good attitude about it.” \nThe Lady Lions enter next week’s state tournament with last year’s championship nucleus in tact. It includes senior captains Katie Jones at libero and Chasey Mitchell at middle hitter, as well as junior setter Peyton Lohlein. That group was joined by senior transfer Libby Rogers in addition to the arrival of new head coach Joe Herrera. \n“That’s what probably made this year easier with a new coach is we had played together for so long. So it wasn’t anything new,” Hayes said. “I think this year is probably the hardest we’ve had to work because of the competition. It’s definitely been a lot tougher, especially because we’ve been able to play GHSA [schools]. We’ve gotten a chance to show our skills a little bit because no one’s really expecting a small school like us to come out and beat Sandy Creek and McIntosh and Starr’s Mill and all those schools. That’s a lot of fun.” \nHayes originally played youth basketball before falling in love with volleyball from the get-go as a seventh grader at Trinity. She now played on a top-10 nationally-ranked lineup for the Tsunami Volleyball club out of Forest Park, playing travel ball year-round and working out two or times a week on top of varsity practices. \nHayes said she didn’t hesitate after receiving an offer from Georgia Tech while also considering Kennesaw State prior to a verbal commitment. \n“I’m definitely excited. It’s been really stressful, because junior year is when [schools are] looking at you. When I got the offer, I just wanted to get it out of the way and not have to worry about it,” Hayes said. \nTrinity’s season includes a 12-1 record against GHSA schools including a 2-0 victory over Newnan, which won this year’s Coweta County Championship. \nThe single-elimination GISA tournament could have Trinity and Heritage meeting in this year’s semifinals if the Coweta rivals win its opening two matches. \n“It’s tough playing in that atmosphere. But it’s always a fun game and those girls are so sweet,” Hayes said of Heritage. \nTrinity also hopes the third time is the charm should it match up one more time with Oak Mountain. \n“They have tons of talent,” said Hayes.
