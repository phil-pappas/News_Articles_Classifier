Love's pass, which showcased his unique versatility, was one of the few highlights during an 87-81 loss against the Raptors.", "external_links": ["https://vine.co/v/e9rEH5WwEPM/embed/simple", "https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-19T06:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T07:49:32.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
