The Pirates have averaged nine wins per season over the past three years. Just this season, ECU beat Virginia Tech and gave Florida — which is undefeated and ranked No. 11 in the country this week — a major scare at The Swamp before falling, 31-24.\nBYU and East Carolina will meet for the first time Saturday (5:30 p.m. MT, ESPNU).\nAll Cougar outside linebackers coach Kelly Poppinga had to do to get that point across to his players this week was show them footage of the Pirates’ dynamic, quick-strike offense.\n“It’s pretty simple. You turn on the film and they’re pretty dang good,” he said. “It got their attention real quick how good these guys are. Yeah, they don’t have the ‘Michigan’ or ‘Nebraska’ name, but this is the third-best offense we’ve played this season and it’s a great challenge for our guys. It’s a great opportunity to show what kind of defense we can be.”\nEast Carolina is efficient as well, as it leads the nation in third-down conversion percentage, converting 55 percent of its attempts.\nThe past two weeks, the Pirates have rallied from deficits to win, starting with the win over Virginia Tech. ECU trailed 14-0 to the Hokies before outscoring them 35-14 the rest of the way. Last week at SMU , the Pirates found themselves down 24-7 before scoring 42 unanswered points in a 49-23 win.\nPoppinga repeated that ECU has “the third-best offense we’ve seen to this point — UCLA , Michigan, then these guys. I think they’re better than Boise State on offense. They have more weapons.”\nECU employs a two-quarterback system — junior Blake Kemp, a pocket passer, and junior James Summers, a dual-threat QB.\nAt SMU, Kemp played in the first quarter, completing 10 of 16 passes for 96 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions. Summers played the last three quarters and was 9 of 10 for 153 yards and two touchdowns and he rushed for 85 yards and two more TDs.\nAgainst Florida, Kemp passed for a career-high 333 yards and three touchdowns. A fumble at the Gator 30-yard line with 12 seconds left prevented the Pirates from possibly forcing overtime.\nECU coach Ruffin McNeill won’t say which QB will start Saturday against BYU.\n“I like the way they play off each other. They both make our team and each other better,” he said of his two quarterbacks. “I think their talents complement each other and make teams prepare. You have to prepare differently for both. ... I think it gives us the best opportunity (to win) as a team.”\n\"You’ve got to know who’s in the game,\" Poppinga said. \"If (Kemp) is in the game, they’re going to throw it. Not much of a run threat. If (Summers) is in the game, they’re going to run the ball a lot more. When he’s in the game, he’s keeping the ball. He’s running guys over, dragging Virginia Tech’s guys down the field.  He’s a big, physical runner who’s fast. We’ve got to be able to bring that guy down.”\nWide receiver Isaiah Jones (38 catches, 473 yards) is No. 13 in the country in receptions per game and No. 16 in receiving yards. Tight end Bryce Williams has caught 23 passes for 232 yards.\n“Their receiver is probably the best guy we’ve seen so far this season,” Poppinga said. “Their tight end is by far the best we’ve seen. He’s really good. Really good skill guys to get the ball to.”\nMeanwhile, running back Chris Hairston has rushed 44 times for 301 yards and five touchdowns.\nDefensively, the Pirates are led by linebacker Montese Overton, the reigning American Athletic Conference defensive player of the week. Overton has 31 career tackles for loss. Against SMU, he had a school-record four sacks, five tackles for loss and a pass breakup as the Pirates held the Mustangs scoreless for the final 40 minutes of the game.\n“We need offense, defense and special teams all playing together,” McNeill said. “That’s really key.”\nEMAIL: jeffc@deseretnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:45:18.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
