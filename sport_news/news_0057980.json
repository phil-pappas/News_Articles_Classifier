Puskar) \nPITTSBURGH (AP) — Landry Jones had his first regular-season NFL action last week. \nNow, it looks as if he will make his first start this week. \nCoach Mike Tomlin said Tuesday that his team will prepare for Sunday’s game against the Chiefs at Kansas City as if Jones will be the starting quarterback. \nStarter Ben Roethlisberger has been out since spraining the medical collateral ligament in his left knee Sept. 27 in a win over the Rams at St. Louis. \nBackup Mike Vick suffered a strained right hamstring in last Sunday’s 25-13 victory over the Arizona Cardinals. \n“I think it’s prudent and appropriate right now to operate under the assumption that Landry is our quarterback this week,” Tomlin said. “He is the guy that’s healthy.” \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:57:25.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
