At a time like this, it was only natural. As the Cubs get set for their first postseason game since 2008, Williams could imagine the unbridled joy Banks would be feeling. And he could see Santo in the radio booth, agonizing over every pitch. “A lot of people ask me, ‘How would Ronnie take it?’” Williams said. “I say if he doesn’t have a heart attack, he’ll be fine.” Santo, a nine-time All-Star over 15 seasons, died in 2010. Banks, the smiling Hall of Fame slugger known as “Mr. Cub” after a 19-year career in the majors, died in January. When Chicago takes the field for the National League wild-card game, Williams figures two big supporters will be looking down, enjoying the moment as much as he is. It’s one that was a long time coming, after five straight losing seasons and a top-to-bottom overhaul under president of baseball operations Theo Epstein and general manager Jed Hoyer. “They stuck with their guns,” Williams said. “They stuck by it. They said, ‘We’re gonna build a good minor league system, and in the future these guys are gonna get in here and they’re gonna play well. And they’re gonna play well for a long time.’ This is what I see.” BALTIMORE (AP) — The Toronto Blue Jays yelled, hugged and jumped for joy around the mound after clinching their first AL East title in 22 years. With their 15-2 rout of Baltimore in the first game of a doubleheader Wednesday, the Blue Jays brought an appropriate conclusion to their unstoppable, two-month run. The Orioles won the nightcap 8-1, getting two home runs from Chris Davis. Kevin Gausman (4-7) had a career-high 10 strikeouts over eight innings against a lineup consisting entirely of backups. Toronto entered the doubleheader needing only one victory to eliminate the New York Yankees and claim its first title since 1993.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:08:27.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
