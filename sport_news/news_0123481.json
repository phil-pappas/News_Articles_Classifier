Brock said he was humbled as at least 50 alumni turned out before the match to watch the unveiling ceremony.\n“The best place in the world was on the field,” said Brock.\n“He was the program for years,” said current Rockets coach Jimmy Odierna. “He brought the program to where it is today.”\nThe game that followed was a lesson in defense as Needham (8-1-4) played Newton South (4-5-2) to a 0-0 tie. The Rockets had several opportunities early, but then fell back and let the Lions use solid footwork to clog up the field.\nNeedham took the field for the second half with a much quicker tempo, but Newton South goalie Dan Epstein made three saves in the half to lead a stifling defense.\nBoys soccer\nIn a Catholic Conference contest, Max Presutti and Christian Labect scored a goal apiece to lead BC High (6-3-1) past Catholic Memorial , 2-0.\nIn nonleague action, Brian Brennan and Josh Lang tallied a goal each as St. John’s Prep (4-3-4) outlasted Andover , 2-1.\nMarcello Rossetti, Kevin Barrucci and Brian Roach contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:30:48.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
