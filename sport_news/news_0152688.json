Spieth certainly had a season to remember, winning five tour titles, making 21 of 25 cuts, and setting the single-season mark for official prize money winnings by earning more than $12m. \nSpieth, who grew up in Dallas, said: “It’s a season to remember. It’s an honor to win player of the year because it is MVP of our league and it’s voted on by the players and for them to recognize the hard work we’ve put in and what we’ve been able to do with it is truly special.” \nPGA tour commissioner Tom Finchem said: “Our young stars shone brighter than ever before, but none brighter than Jordan Spieth. \n“He captivated us throughout a memorable year that included the FedExCup and five victories, highlighted by two major championships. And the sportsmanship he displayed in both victory and defeat was a stirring indication of the role model and ambassador he has become in a very short period of time.” \nPGA tour members who played in at least 15 official money events this past season were eligible to vote. The balloting process ended on October 1. \nDaniel Berger won the rookie of the year award. The 22-year-old was the only rookie at the season-ending Tour Championship last week after a runner-up finish in the penultimate playoffs event, the BMW Championship. \nFinchem said: “He capped his first season on tour with a strong showing in the FedExCup Playoffs and demonstrated great character and sportsmanship on and off the course, as evidence by this peer vote.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:49:55.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
