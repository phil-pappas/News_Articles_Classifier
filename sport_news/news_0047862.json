The initial timeline for a return was set at 12-14 weeks and remains the same following the surgery.\nShumpert was working out prior to training camp when he banged his wrist on the rim. Known as one of the toughest players in the Cavaliers' locker room, Shumpert kept working out, even taking the court over the weekend with former Knicks teammate J.R. Smith.\n\"It hit home for me because we were in Sunday getting shots up and he was shooting the ball and shooting like Shump,\" Smith said. \"We were just talking about everything we've been through -- his injuries, contract situation and stuff like that. To see him go through that this early again is frustrating for myself and him I'm sure. That's what a team is about. We have to pick him up and bring him with us wherever we go. Even though he won't be here or on the court physically, he will be there mentally.\"\nThe \"next man up\" mantra , one the Cavs adopted during their injury-riddled postseason run, remains. Still, hearing the news about the team's latest setback on the first day of training camp was surprising to many, including Smith, who spent much of Monday's media day laughing and taking pictures with Shumpert.\n\"Monday everything was fine,\" Smith said. \"I knew the doctor said he probably had to tape it up or something like that, but then he snuck away and got some MRIs or X-rays or whatever and before you know it they just told us he was going to be out. It's kind of weird seeing someone so upbeat, happy and doing stuff like that and then 30 or 40 minutes later he's got to go get surgery or whatever. It's a team thing and we all have to step up in his place.\"\nInjuries are nothing new for Shumpert. The 25-year-old swingman known for his tenacious defense has yet to play a full season in his five-year career. He even fought through a groin injury for the final three playoff series.\n\"Fortunately mentally he's been in this situation before,\" Smith said of his teammate. \"He knows not to get too down on himself. He understands he's going to come back and be a huge piece to this ginormous puzzle we got.\"\nSmith, who started 45 games with the Cavs following a trade from New York, is the most likely candidate to replace Shumpert in the starting lineup. After choosing to decline his player option following a rough NBA Finals appearance, Smith elected to return to Cleveland, taking less money. Shumpert's latest injury helps shine light on Smith's value and why the Cavs were so inclined to bring him back despite some down moments in the playoffs.\n\"Whether it was Shump or anybody else I think everybody has to be ready,\" Smith said. \"This is a more similar situation because of last year and stuff like that but at the same time I still have to come and be ready to play, be there for my teammates. Just have to do my job.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:38:11.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
