And considering District 8 is one of the toughest in the state, with a gauntlet of undefeated Abilene, followed by undefeated Buhler just to start, the momentum built is welcomed by the Bullpups. “We were in need of a great performance out of the gates,” McPherson head coach Jace Pavlovich said. “We are heading in the right direction going into district play. The kids have been focused on the task at hand so far this week.” The task at hand will be a tough test from the undefeated Cowboys, who have beaten every opponent this season by an average of nearly 25 points. Abilene has been led in large part by senior quarterback Harley Hazlett leaving a wake of destruction in his path. “They have a great quarterback,” Pavlovich said. “If a team has the best player on the field, they have a chance to win. They have had the best player on the field the first six games of the season. They are big, and physical up front in addition to that. We have to go out and execute like we are capable of to get a win. It will boil down to turnovers and time of possession. If we can win in those two categories, we will put ourselves in position to win.” If there is any defense that is up to the task of creating turnovers, it is McPherson’s. In a Week 1 stunner to open the season against Salina South, the Bullpup defense was outstanding, forcing a turnover in each of the first two Cougar plays from scrimmage that set up two touchdowns in a 14-7 win. McPherson hasn’t looked back. Against Winfield, the Bullpups scored defensive touchdowns, as well as a special teams touchdown taking the opening kickoff back for a score. “Our defense has been our strength all year,” Pavlovich said. “While it’s nice to score defensively, we have got to play the field position battle. If we can put our offense in short fields, we always have a chance to win, no matter who the opponent is.” With a road trip to Buhler waiting in Week 8, there is an extra sense of urgency going into the game against Abilene, which give the night a playoff feel. “Our kids are well aware of the situation in our district,” Pavlovich said. We have to get one of the next two games to put ourselves in position against Hays to go to the playoffs. We have to keep in mind the point spread as well. I have been a part of teams that have gone 2-1 in (districts), but had to stay at home due to the point spread.” Page 2 of 2 - McPherson will open districts at 7 p.m. on Friday at McPherson Stadium.
