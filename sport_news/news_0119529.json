Getty \nAustralia take on Wales at Twickenham to determine who tops Pool A and avoids a quarter-final clash with South Africa. Where to watch Australia v Wales \nAustralia v Wales will be available live on ITV1 on Saturday 10 October with kick off scheduled for 4.45pm (BST). Preview \nAfter both gleefully recorded wins over England, Australia and Wales will battle it out to decide who tops Pool A. The pair will start Saturday's match level on 13 points but the Wallabies have history on their side; in their last 10 meetings against this opposition, they have won all 10 with their last loss coming at the Millennium Stadium back in 2009. It's a somewhat deceiving record, however, with seven of those defeats for Wales coming by five points or fewer, losing a 33-28 thriller in Cardiff in their last meeting in November 2014 despite leading for most of the contest. \nWales have plenty of incentive to put an end to that run. Ending the hoodoo would also see them rewarded with quarter final spot that will see them avoid South Africa in the quarter-finals, with a meeting with Scotland or Japan looming. \nAustralia will have their eye on that easier route to the semis however and will welcome back Israel Folau to help them get there after the 26-year-old passed a fitness test following a troublesome ankle problem. Elsewhere, Michael Hooper will serve his suspension with 21-year-old Sean McMahon dropping into the back row to replace him. Rob Horne is the other enforced change, having failed his fitness test on Thursday, with Drew Mitchell coming into replace him at wing. \nMeanwhile, Warren Gatland has made six changes to his starting XV. New Zealand-born Gareth Anscombe comes in at full back with Liam Williams fit enough to return at left wing. George North also returns to the fray and will start at outside centre. Cheika wary of 'genius' Gatland. Getty Teams \nAustralia: Israel Folau, Adam Ashley-Cooper, Tevita Kuridrani, Matt Giteau, Drew Mitchell, Bernard Foley, Will Genia, Scott Sio, Stephen Moore (capt), Sekope Kepu, Kane Douglas, Dean Mumm, Scott Fardy, Sean McMahon, David Pocock. \nReplacements: Tatafu Polota-Nau, James Slipper, Greg Holmes, Rob Simmons, Ben McCalman, Nick Phipps, Matt Toomua, Kurtley Beale. \nWales: Gareth Anscombe (Cardiff Blues), Alex Cuthbert (Cardiff Blues), George North (Northampton), Jamie Roberts (Harlequins), Liam Williams (Scarlets), Dan Biggar (Ospreys), Gareth Davies (Scarlets), Paul James (Ospreys), Scott Baldwin (Ospreys), Samson Lee (Scarlets), Luke Charteris (Racing 92), Alun Wyn Jones (Ospreys), Sam Warburton (capt, Cardiff Blues), Justin Tipuric (Ospreys), Taulupe Faletau (Newport Gwent Dragons). \nReplacements: Ken Owens (Scarlets), Aaron Jarvis (Ospreys), Tomas Francis (Exeter Chiefs), Jake Ball (Scarlets), Ross Moriarty (Gloucester Rugby), Lloyd Williams (Cardiff Blues), Rhys Priestland (Bath Rugby), James Hook (Gloucester Rugby) What the coaches say: \nMichael Cheika: \"He [Gatland] is a genius. We still have much to do and we are coming up against a master coach. He knows how to move things around and he is very successful in what he does. He is a very successful coach and I have a massive amount of respect for him and the quality he brings to the teams he coaches. He has a lot of experience at international level. I am in the lower tier of all that.\" \nWarren Gatland: \"Gareth [Anscombe] has played a lot at fullback. Two years ago he played in the Super Rugby final for the Chiefs at fullback. He's experienced, has the pedigree. We wanted to throw something a little bit different at Australia. I'm excited by the backline. \n\"Justin [Tipuric] deserves an opportunity. He's been absolutely outstanding in the warm-up games and when he has played [in the tournament]. It just gives us options. [It's about] matching them at the breakdown. It's going to be a fierce contest. We have two real world-class players at six and seven that can compete at the breakdown for us. \n\"Paul James needed to play. Given his [Gethin Jenkins'] injury history in the past, after three or four games in a row, he has broken down. We just wanted to keep him fit and fresh potentially for the quarter-finals.\" More about Rugby World Cup", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T11:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:58:37.238+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
