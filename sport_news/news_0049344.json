This discussion is strictly about the football.\nThough sometimes the labels aren’t fair, coaches largely get put into either the “recruiter” box or the “X-and-O guy” box, even though most coaches have a mix of attributes that make them successful.\nWhereas Mark Dantonio and Gary Patterson are obviously good recruiters and talent evaluators, their teams are great because they’re great at the coaching stuff. Conversely, Hugh Freeze and Les Miles are adequate on the sidelines and good enough most days because they are able to convince elite players to come to their schools in a highly-competitive recruiting environment. Only a few coaches — Nick Saban, Urban Meyer and probably Jim Harbaugh — are elite in both aspects, which is why their teams will win big every single year.\nBecause there aren’t many of those available, most schools will have to make a choice. At Ole Miss, where you're not going to just fall into talent that can compete in the SEC, Freeze has more value. (They already tried an elite X-and-O coach with David Cutcliffe, and he got fired after a moderately successful six-year run). At Michigan State, where you're not going to land many five-stars, you need a coaching advantage because you’re not going to have a talent advantage over the programs you’re trying to beat.\nWhich makes it all the more interesting to watch things as they unfold at USC, which has now suffered two inexplicable home losses to Stanford and Washington despite being picked to win the Pac 12.\nSarkisian is undoubtedly on thin ice, based both on his penchant for losing games he’s not supposed to lose and the off-field issues, which first became public at the preseason “Salute to Troy” booster event incident in which athletics director Pat Haden had to pull him off stage during a speech because he appeared drunk.\nAnd if USC makes a change, it will be interesting to see if the school goes back to the “recruiter\" well for a third straight time following Lane Kiffin and Steve Sarkisian or seeks out a coach with a reputation for out-coaching the competition.\nThough USC has had some ancillary issues related to NCAA sanctions, the team has not lacked for talent. Sarkisian inherited some legitimate stars from Kiffin and signed recruiting classes ranked Nos. 10 and No. 2, respectively, in his first two years.\nAnd yet how much talent does he have to amass to insulate USC from a chronic lack of focus and intensity, silly penalties, inconsistent execution and obvious coaching gaffes against quality opponents?\nThere’s no doubt talent wins games and there's a baseline level of recruiting required to win championships, but a place with USC’s location and tradition shouldn’t need tricks to recruit. If you put a competent product on the field, develop players and send them to the NFL, recruits will come.\nNo matter how many No. 1 classes Sarkisian signs, the margins in college football are small enough that coaching competence will be the difference between winning championships and going 9-3.\nUSC would be wise to remember that next time it has to hire a coach — which may not be that far away.\n(Disclaimer: This isn't a ranking of worst teams, worst losses or coaches whose jobs are in the most jeopardy. This is simply a measurement of a fan base's knee-jerk reaction to what they last saw. The way in which a team won or lost, expectations vis-à-vis program trajectory and traditional inferiority complex of fan base all factor into this ranking.)\n(Disclaimer No. 2: By virtue of their decision to make coaching changes, Maryland and North Texas are hereby excluded from this and future editions of the Misery Index, as fans can look forward to a new regime taking hold in 2016.)\n1. Southern California: There's no way to spin it. The Trojans’ 17-12 loss to Washington on Thursday night was needless and putrid and emblematic of everything wrong with the Sarkisian era on the field. One week after playing very well at Arizona State, the Trojans were lethargic and sloppy against a young Washington team.\nIf it was the first time that happened, it wouldn’t be so alarming for USC fans, who were already skeptical of Sarkisian based on his 34-29 record at Washington. But the whole “play great one week, lay an egg the next” has been a theme for Sark’s teams at USC, too. (Remember the trip to Boston College last season?) That may fly some places, but it shouldn’t at USC..\n2. Georgia: When the Misery Index visited with Georgia athletics director Greg McGarity before the Alabama game, his view was that the lack of a breakthrough championship season was less important than the fact that Mark Richt had kept the program nationally relevant every year but one.That exception was 2010 when Georgia finished 6-7, giving rise to legitimate hot seat talk.\nThe following year, the Bulldogs started 0-2 but won their next 10 and made the SEC championship game, and Richt hasn’t felt much heat since. But McGarity’s relevance argument doesn’t exactly hold up to scrutiny. After Georgia’s crushing 38-31 defeat at Tennessee on Saturday, dropping the Bulldogs to 2-2 in the SEC, it’s now fair to look at Richt’s career in two blocks.\nIn his first eight years, Richt led Georgia to two SEC championships, six double-digit win seasons and six top-10 finishes. That’s an unbelievable résumé by any measure. But let’s look at what’s happened since. In 2009, the Bulldogs started 3-3 and were out of the race for anything significant by early October, finishing 8-5. Then came the 2010 debacle. Though 2011 was a nice rebound from starting 0-2, the reality is Georgia took advantage of a weak SEC East and got blasted by LSU in the championship game, then lost to Michigan State in the Outback Bowl.\nGeorgia was certainly good enough to win a national title in 2012, coming up just short against Alabama in the SEC championship game and finishing No. 4 for the year. Georgia was injury-plagued in 2013 and lost consecutive October games to Missouri and Vanderbilt to remove itself from contention for anything significant. And though last season Georgia went 10-3, it was disappointing because of losses to mediocre teams in South Carolina and Florida and a failure to win the exceptionally down SEC East.\nIn other words, while Richt’s first eight years were tremendous, the last seven have been pretty unexceptional with only one team even close to good enough to compete for an SEC or national title, which makes 2012 the outlier in the second stage of Richt’s career. And this Georgia team just isn’t as good as its 4-0 start against weak competition made it appear.\nIts quarterback has been exposed, its defense got picked apart by a Tennessee team that was struggling all season to generate a passing game and its special teams were generally awful, including a game-changing turnover late in the second quarter (special teams have been a frequent sore spot under Richt). Depending on what you think Georgia should be accomplishing given its location and resources, you can make a case that Richt should be the coach forever or that he should be fired immediately. Either way, that conversation is going to start heating up again.\n3. Oklahoma: You can argue, if you want, that Bob Stoops has suffered more surprising losses than Saturday in the Red River Rivalry. (That 2001 loss to a bad Oklahoma State team was a true head-scratcher). You can argue he has suffered more damaging losses. (Getting beat by Texas Tech in 2011 as a huge favorite while being ranked No. 3 in the country was pretty bad.) You could argue he has suffered more embarrassing losses. (Getting run off the field by Baylor the last two years by a combined 89-26 isn’t good for the ol’ résumé.)\nBut all told, few if any losses in Stoops’ tenure will make fans madder Saturday’s 24-17 loss to Texas. Even with the caveat that funny things happen in rivalry games, this should have been a layup for Oklahoma. We can argue whether the Sooners’ wins against Tennessee and West Virginia made them a legitimate contender, but if you want to be taken seriously you have to beat this version of Texas.\nYes, the Longhorns have some young talent, but there’s a reason they started 1-4 this season and were 17-point underdogs on Saturday. Putting aside how huge it was for Charlie Strong to get a big win, which was appropriately the dominant story line, Texas is going to struggle to get to 6-6. And yet the Longhorns owned Oklahoma on the line of scrimmage, which has been a theme of this rivalry in recent years.\nTexas played harder and Oklahoma fell into the trap of relying too much on its passing game. For Samaje Perine and Joe Mixon to carry the ball a combined 16 times is ridiculous. That’s how you get beat as a double-digit favorite, which Oklahoma has done quite a few times the last three years. But this one might have been the worst of all.\n4. Oregon: The post-Mariota drop-off is real, and it’s not going away. That must be the heart-sinking takeaway for Oregon fans after watching the Ducks lose to Washington State on Saturday, 45-38 in overtime. Even if you were inclined to write off the 62-20 disaster against Utah to a combination of flukeish factors, suffering a second home loss — and not even to one of the Pac 12’s best teams — is alarming.\nOne of the nation’s most consistently great programs over the past decade is in real danger of falling off the cliff just one year after playing in the national title game. It might not be fair, but non-bluebloods such as Oregon don’t have long windows to maintain their credibility as powerhouse programs. The Floridas and USCs can dip but come back quickly because the brand sustains and attracts good enough players for a new coach to recruit his way out of a hole.\nIt’s unclear whether Oregon has that kind of juice, which adds to the urgency for the Ducks to get back to their winning ways quickly or face the real danger of becoming just a nice regional program as opposed to a national contender. Meanwhile, unless the Ducks get better quarterback play this year (or at least get Vernon Adams back from his finger injury) they will have a hard time extending their streak of consecutive bowl appearances to 11. And unless they have an answer for next season, coach Mark Helfrich could find himself quickly on the hot seat.\n5. Nebraska: Maybe it’s the Curse of Faux Pelini, the parody Twitter persona of the Huskers’ former coach Bo Pelini. “LET THE HATE CONSUME YOU MIKE,” @FauxPelini Tweeted moments after Nebraska lost 23-21 at home to Wisconsin on Saturday, dropping the Huskers to 2-4. It wasn’t particularly controversial when Nebraska sent Pelini packing after seven consecutive seasons of winning nine or 10 games, but maybe it should have been.\nPelini’s consistency — even if the ceiling for his program never seemed particularly high — has to be preferable to what is going on now at Nebraska, which has lost four times in devastating fashion already in Mike Riley’s first season. After the Hail Mary against Brigham Young, the overtime loss at Miami and a blown clock management situation that led to a loss at Illinois, Nebraska invented a new way to lose Saturday.\nDown 21-20, Wisconsin kicker Rafael Gaglianone missed a 39-yard field goal with 1:26 remaining. That should have been the ballgame, right? Not with this Nebraska team. The Huskers played it super-conservative, forcing Wisconsin to use its timeouts before punting the ball with 63 seconds remaining. That was enough time for Wisconsin to get in position for another field goal, this time from 46 yards. It was good. Nebraska’s record is bad. And the pressure on Riley, even in his first season, is getting cranked-up big time.\n6. Boston College: There is nothing in sports more deflating than being a fan of a team that does one thing really, really well and basically can’t do anything else. That is the plight of Boston College, a team that has allowed a total of 40 points in its last four games and has only one victory against Northern Illinois to show for it.\nIn the era of flashy offenses, Boston College seems like a prehistoric fossil of a football team. The Eagles held Florida State to 217 yards and lost. They held Duke to 228 yards and lost. They held Wake Forest on Saturday to 142 yards and lost 3-0. That’s a miserable team to watch and probably more miserable to root for because no matter how much Boston College dominates on defense, its offense is so inevitably poor that very winnable games seem impossible.\nThough the Eagles were handicapped when quarterback Darius Wade broke his ankle in the Florida State game, the lack of success offensively in the ACC means this is going to be a long and painful year to watch play out. Coach Steve Addazio has built the program on his mantra of “Be a dude.” How about a new one: “Score a point.”\n7. Miami (Fla.): Better, but not good enough. That’s the takeaway for Miami fans, who have upped the ante from flying airplane banners imploring the school to fire Al Golden and instead moved on to hacking his Wikipedia page, accusing him of “burying any leftover ashes of the once famed football program that remained as deep into the ground as possible.”\nHeck, even Florida State fans got into the act this weekend, with one store selling shirts in Tallahassee that read: “Keep Al Golden.” It's ugly in Miami, but Saturday was actually one of the Hurricanes' better efforts against a quality opponent under Golden. They lost at Florida State 29-24 but had several chances in the fourth quarter to drive down the field and win.\nIt's not out of the question for Miami — a pretty young team — to get to 8-4 and possibly save Golden’s job. On the other hand, that record isn’t going to impress the fans and former players currently calling for change. The bottom line is Florida State has won six in a row against Miami, and until the Hurricanes can change that, they won't be nationally relevant.\n8. Michigan State: The Spartans are in a strange spot. They are 6-0 but clearly not playing as well as they were supposed to play, holding on for dear life the last two weeks against Big Ten bottom-feeders Rutgers and Purdue. The 31-28 Week 2 win against Oregon, meanwhile, now doesn’t look like much of an accomplishment at all and injuries are piling up.\nThis has put Michigan State fans on the defensive. Amongst each other, they complain about the play of this team, which was supposed to be one of those once-in-a-generation type of teams at Michigan State that could win a national title if things broke right. And yet whenever a reporter brings up how Michigan State has not played up to its national ranking and that Michigan — gasp — might be the best team in the Big Ten right now, they throw a fit and cry about disrespect. We’ll find out who’s right soon enough.\nThe Spartans head to Michigan on Saturday for a game that, truth be told, has to terrify their fan base. This is the year Michigan State had to make good on being the big dog in the state before Jim Harbaugh’s influence started to tip the balance in recruiting and on the field. Hardly anyone expected that Michigan might actually be the better team this year. But that’s a very possible scenario right now, with Michigan State scuffling along in wins and the Wolverines coming off three consecutive dominant, shutout victories.\nIf Michigan wins this game, effectively ending the Spartans’ hopes of making the College Football Playoff, it may be years before Michigan State fans recover from the gut-punch.\n9. Texas-El Paso: We know there are worse teams in the Football Bowl Subdivision simply by virtue of the fact that Kansas, New Mexico State, Wyoming and Idaho still play. But the Misery Index couldn't help but notice what was happening with the Miners this weekend in their first Conference USA road game of the season at Florida International. UTEP was down 21-0 after one quarter and 42-3 after 24:19 of game time before FIU applied some mercy in the second half and cruised to a 52-12 win.\nUTEP ranks 116th nationally in total offense and 104th in total offense and has lost games by 35 (to Arkansas), 49 (to Texas Tech), 19 (to Texas-San Antonio) and now 40 to FIU. That’s a very swift and sudden fall for the Miners, who were quite competitive overall last season under Sean Kugler and made a bowl game at 7-6. UTEP lost quite a bit of talent off that team, but getting blown out at FIU and looking that inept is not something the fans in El Paso will or should accept.\n10. Fresno State: What in the world has happened to this program? For his first two years, it looked like Tim DeRuyter had it rolling and would regularly challenge Boise State for supremacy in the Mountain West (before, presumably, leaving for a bigger job). Of course, that was when the Bulldogs had Derek Carr at quarterback, who led them to 20 wins in those two seasons and made things seem pretty easy for a program that traditionally has been among the best outside the power conferences.\nIt wasn’t a huge surprise that Fresno State regressed in 2014 without Carr — and they did regress, pretty significantly — but the Bulldogs were still able to win their division and play in a bowl game. This year, though, the bottom appears to have fallen out. Fresno State is 1-5 overall and has essentially been blown out in every loss. Though losing by big margins to Ole Miss and Utah wasn’t unexpected, Fresno State is getting pummeled on a weekly basis by programs that should not be doing any pummeling.\nA 26-point loss to San Jose State? A 14-point loss to San Diego State? A 42-point loss at home to Utah State? And it’s happening while DeRuyter has trotted out four different starting quarterbacks, which doesn’t speak very well of the recruiting job his staff has done. DeRuyter, by the way, is signed to a contract that pays $1.5 million annually through 2018 — fully guaranteed — which makes him one of the most highly compensated and secure coaches in a non-Power 5 job. That’s a lot of money for a product that looks like it may not win another game this season.\nHonorable mention (Miserable, but not miserable enough): Purdue, Syracuse, N.C.
