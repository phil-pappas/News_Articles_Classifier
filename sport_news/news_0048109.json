By the time the game was over, the Buckeyes should have been wearing black armbands instead as they somberly departed Happy Valley on the wrong end of a 63-14 rout. \nThe only thing missing was a funeral dirge. \nI bring that up why? \nOn Saturday, the Buckeyes are breaking out all-black alternate uniforms for their prime-time visit from Penn State. Hopefully, the unis won't come to symbolize the mood inside Ohio Stadium as fans watch an OSU defense that has sort of lost its way. \nLuke Fickell's troops came alive in the 2014 postseason, blanking Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship Game and then making third down a nightmare for No. 1 Alabama and No. 2 Oregon in the College Football Playoff — all three of those teams led by Heisman Trophy finalists and, in Oregon's case, the Heisman winner in quarterback Marcus Mariota. \nOSU's defensive momentum carried over to the first three games of this season until the Buckeyes hit an unexpected pothole. We've been waiting for the wheels to get realigned ever since. \nThe first red flag was three weeks ago against Western Michigan. Ohio State dismissed the Broncos easily, 38-12, but uncharacteristically allowed three offensive series of double-digit plays. \nThen came the 34-27 win over Indiana that came down to a batted down pass in the end zone on the final play, all because the Buckeyes allowed 17 points to an offense driven by a backup quarterback and playing with a backup tailback, instead of a hobbled Jordan Howard, the nation's leading rusher at that time. \nMost alarming of all was Saturday's 49-28 win over Maryland, a team so bad school officials are ready to push the eject button on their head coach's hot seat. \nA busted coverage on the Terps' opening possession resulted in a 52-yard touchdown pass and surprise starting quarterback Perry Hills — who didn't even play the previous week in a 28-0 loss to Michigan — rushed for an alarming 170 yards (206 before losses) on 20 carries. He ripped off a 75-yarder to set up his own short TD run as Maryland came all the way back from a 21-7 deficit to knot things in the third quarter. \nIt was the second straight week an unheralded quarterback had gashed the defense on a jaunt of 70-plus yards. \nAfter Hills scored back-to-back TDs, Ohio State responded with 28 unanswered points and the defense was barely addressed in coach Urban Meyer's post-game press conference. Instead he was peppered with questions about the overwhelming success J.T. Barrett had as a first-time red zone specialist, adding a new twist to OSU's quarterback saga. \nMeyer called it a \"great win\" even though his defense was not so hot. And hasn't been for three weeks. \nIt might seem like micro-critiquing, especially when you look around the country and see, week to week, top-end programs like Alabama, Oregon and TCU get lit up on defense. OK, it's the Big 12, which spits on Woody Hayes' \"You Win With Defense\" doctrine, but the Horned Frogs give up 97 points in their last two road games and we're supposed to swallow them as a national title contender? \nBy comparison, OSU's defense is air tight. And ground staunch. \nBut one of the reasons the Buckeyes won a national championship last season was because they were equally good on both sides of the ball. With the offense coming out of its doldrums, now is no time for the defense to go south. \nThe good news is that the Big Ten is not stacked with mobile quarterbacks, at least not in the East Division, Barrett being the best of the lot. Still, the Buckeyes' problems in that area need to be addressed and quickly. Even though Penn State quarterback Christian Hackenberg is more Peyton Manning than Russell Wilson, his feet were a weapon in Saturday's 29-7 win over Indiana. (Yes, the same Hoosiers who put up 20 more points on OSU.) \nHackenberg scored twice on the ground, setting up one of his TDs by cutting upfield for a 22-yard gain. \n\"It causes headaches,\" Penn State coach James Franklin said afterwards. \"It's a pain. You drop back, you've got everybody covered and now the quarterback is willing to pull it down and go get you a first down.\" \nPerfect timing, right? Now the Lions decide to turn Hackenberg into a runner? He's probably improved his agility from all the time running for his life because his line is a sieve. \nAt least the Buckeyes won't be able to say this new wrinkle in Penn State's attack caught them by surprise. It's the excuse they used at Indiana when Zander Diamont took over for injured Nate Sudfeld and again Saturday when Hills got the nod over two other QBs bracketed with him on the depth chart. \n\"We're humbled by it,\" safety Vonn Bell said in response to the 386 yards and four touchdowns generated by Maryland's offense. \"We're the No. 1 team in the nation, so we're going to get everybody's best shot. You have to the weather the storm and just keep playing the football.\" \nWhat's weird is that some of the individual efforts this season have been outstanding. Tackle Adolphus Washington's stock is rising, Bell has become the unspoken leader in the secondary and sophomore Raekwon McMillan looks like someone who will eventually join the pantheon of great linebackers at Ohio State. \nIt's also a good sign that end Joey Bosa finally played up to his consensus All-America form on Saturday, with a career-high four quarterback hurries and his first —believe it or not — solo sack of the season. \nBut with the second half of the regular season much tougher than the first, the defense as a whole needs to get back its mojo. A defense that fancies itself as Silver Bullets needs to stop firing duds. \nI mean that in the nicest way. We could be saddled with TCU's defense. \njspencer@nncogannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T22:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T23:46:43.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
