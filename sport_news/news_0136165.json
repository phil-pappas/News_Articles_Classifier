When he took the athletic director’s job at Montville in the summer, Orbe knew his time as coach of his alma mater was over. On Thursday, Montville named assistant Steve Stonoha as his successor. Stonoha has been the pitching coach at Montville since 2006, coincidentally the same year the program won its first Class M state championship. The Indians followed that up with back-to-back titles in 2010-11. Under Orbe, Montville appeared in six state championship games, including last year’s Class M loss to Sheehan. The Indians have made 13 consecutive Class M quarterfinal appearances. “Phil has created a program,” said Stonoha, who was promoted to associate head coach in 2008. “It’s not just a good team from year-to-year. He knows the game, had the kids prepared, always working in the offseason and doing the right thing in the classroom.” Orbe said Stonoha was clearly the best candidate. “I’m happy for him. It’s good to know the program is in good hands,” Orbe said. “I was always comfortable with Steve taking over. A lot of the principles the program was built on, Steve is familiar with and that makes it a pretty seamless transition.” The 37-year-old Stonoha, a math teacher at the high school, won state titles as both a player and coach, as well as a collegiate national championship. He won a state championship as a player at Derby High in 1996 and later played at Eastern Connecticut State University, where he was a valuable relief pitcher on the 1998 Division III national championship team. “Through the years, Phil and I have become pretty close friends,” said Stonoha, who has organized offseason workouts and the team’s weightlifting program in recent years. “I know the time and effort he put into it. I don’t want to let him down and I’m going to work as hard as I possible can to not let that happen.” Stonoha also served for two years as the pitching coach for the Mystic Schooners of the New England Collegiate Baseball League. “I want to make sure the program continues on the right track and people feel the same way about baseball at Montville in my tenure as head coach,” Stonoha said.
