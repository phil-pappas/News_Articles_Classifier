Both the Mets and Cubs have great offenses, sure, but those are two premium pitchers. The cold weather didn't help matters either.\nThe Mets struck first on Daniel Murphy 's first inning solo home run , his latest go-ahead homer of the postseason, though the Cubs eventually answered back in the fifth. Harvey retired the first 12 batters he faced before hitting Anthony Rizzo with a pitch leading off that frame. Starlin Castro doubled over the head of Juan Lagares to tie the game.\nThe Cubbies had an opportunity to take a 2-1 lead that inning, but left fielder Yoenis Cespedes threw Castro out at the plate on Javier Baez 's single. Chicago didn't score again the inning. Here's video of the play at the plate :\nYour browser does not support iframes. \nI get that it's questionable to run on Cespedes given his arm, but I liked the send with light-hitting David Ross and the even lighter-hitting Lester due up. You've got to take some chances to beat a guy like Harvey. The Cubs forced Cespedes to make a play and he did. Credit to him.\nThe 1-1 tie didn't last long. The Mets rallied to take a 2-1 lead in the very next half-inning thanks to three singles. The bottom of the order set the rally up. Here's the play-by-play :\nGiving up singles to the No. 7 ( Wilmer Flores ) and No. 8 (Lagares) hitters is rough, even if Harvey bunted into a force out at third to throw a wrench into the rally. Allowing runners at the bottom of the lineup -- the bottom of an NL team's lineup at that -- to reach base is no way to win the postseason.\nThe singles to Flores and Lagares were mistakes, no doubt, but Lester was one pitch away from escaping the fifth inning unscathed. Lester held left-handed hitters to a .247/.282/.376 (79 OPS+) batting line during the regular season while Curtis Granderson , the next batter, hit a weak .183/.273/.286 (57 OPS+) against southpaws.\nThat was a good matchup for Lester, and, sure enough, he jumped ahead in the count 0-2 to Granderson. He lobbed a curveball for a called strike one and got Granderson to foul off a fastball for strike two. The 0-2 pitch was the mistake pitch. Here's the video first:\nYour browser does not support iframes. \nNow look where Ross, Lester's personal catcher, wanted the pitch and where it ended up:\nRoss wanted Lester to bury a cutter down and away off the plate, hoping to get Granderson to chase for the strikeout. Not a bad strategy at all -- Granderson struck out in 33.6 percent of his plate appearances against lefties this year. Good pitch call.\nInstead of burying the cutter down, Lester missed out over the plate. It was not quite center cut, but it was pretty much thigh high and over the plate. A hittable pitch, for sure. Granderson drove the 0-2 cutter to center field for the go-ahead run-scoring single.\nThis season Granderson went 4 for 46 (.087) with a 56.3 percent strikout rate in 0-2 counts against all pitchers. He went 10 for 88 (.114) in all two-strike counts against lefties and 2 for 15 (.133) against lefties in 0-2 counts. That was Granderson's third hit in an 0-2 count against a left-handed pitcher in 2015. Good timing!\nGranderson's single against Lester's mistake pitch gave the Mets a 2-1 lead in the fifth. They scored another run on Travis d'Arnaud 's solo home run in the sixth and another on Granderson's sac fly in the seventh. The sac fly came on another two-strike pitch from Lester.\nThe inability to put Granderson away in those two-strike counts hurt Lester and the Cubs in Game 1 Saturday night. The Mets eventually won 4-2 ( box score ) to take a one game to none lead in the best-of-seven NLCS.\n\nCurtis Granderson took advantage of Jon Lester's mistake pitch in Game 1.
