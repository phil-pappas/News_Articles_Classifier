A short while later, he would catch the game-winning pass off a tip in the Horned Frogs’ 55-52 win. Max Faulkner Star-Telegram i Order Reprint of this Story \nLeave an impression, Aaron Green tells himself. \n“Every time I step on the field, there’s someone in the stands that’s never heard of Aaron Green, someone that probably will never see me play again,” the TCU running back said. “I want them to know who I am before I leave.” \nWill an 86-yard touchdown run on the first play of the game do the trick? \nGreen smiled. \nHow about a catch off a tip in the back of the end zone? \n“I try to do it every time I touch the ball.” Aaron Green catches a deflected pass in back of end zone with 23 seconds remaining. \nAaron Green is on pace to end a four-year stretch without a 1,000-yard rusher at TCU. He has 625 yards at the halfway point. \nEvery time he has touched the ball, Green has helped the Horned Frogs win games. The senior from San Antonio Madison leads the team in carries, rushing yards and rushing touchdowns. He opened the game at Kansas State last week with an 86-yard touchdown run on the first play. He finished with two touchdown runs, the fourth time in five weeks he’s had that many in a game. \nTwo years after transferring in from Nebraska, his career is starting to resemble what he imagined coming out of high school as a four-star prospect headed to big-time college football. \n“It definitely took a little longer, but I think that’s just how things work sometimes,” he said “Everybody takes different paths. I’m glad for where I’m at.” TCU QB Trevone Boykin Throws Key Block To Set Up Aaron Green's Touchdown Run In The Third Quarter \nObviously, so are the Horned Frogs. They leaned on him in the last five games of the season last year after B.J. Catalon sat out with a concussion from the West Virginia game. \nGreen, who had already prepared to sit behind Rex Burkhead at Nebraska and was waiting his turn at TCU behind Catalon, proved to be an electric runner with his opportunity. He averaged 7.1 yards per carry, the third-most ever in the Big 12, despite the emphasis on the pass in the Air Raid offense. \n“Not only in this offense, but every offense, it’s just confidence — trust in yourself,” Green said. “I trust my vision, I trust my judgment. Every once in a while, I miss a hole. But a lot of times, I hit the right holes. I trust my eyes. I trust my feet. Just run. Just do what I’ve been doing for all these years.” \n\nIt’s just confidence — trust in yourself. I trust my vision, I trust my judgment. Every once in a while, I miss a hole. But a lot of times, I hit the right holes. I trust my eyes. I trust my feet. \nTCU running back Aaron Green \nHe has earned TCU coach Gary Patterson’s trust, which is no small thing. \n“The guy is older, plus the guy plays with confidence,” Patterson said. “You know Aaron is going to do everything during the week he’s supposed to do to get ready for Saturday.” \nPatterson even broke a personal rule for Green. He let him play in the season opener despite the amount of time Green had missed in fall camp while he recovered from a groin injury. \n“That’s different for Gary Patterson,” Patterson said. “You’re not practicing in two-a-days, you’re probably not going to play. That’s just the way it is. The times have changed. In this league, you’ve just got to get your best players to Saturday.” \nGreen thinks back on what could have been early in his career. Indirectly, he blames himself for not being his best. \n“I can kind of look back and see ways that I was probably immature, said things I probably shouldn’t have said; but I mean, that’s kind of normal for a kid coming out of high school not playing, used to being the star,” he said. “It’s definitely humbled me a lot. I’m grateful just for the lessons that I’ve had, honestly.” \n\n14 Touchdown runs for Aaron Green since Oct. 11, 2014, a stretch covering 15 games. Only Ezekiel Elliott of Ohio State has more in that time. \nGreen’s first action at TCU came for a 4-8 team in 2013. He helped get one of those four wins when he ran for 40 yards in the game-winning drive at Iowa State, where he and the Horned Frogs return on Saturday. \n“It means everything to me,” he said, asked what it means to be part of a resurgent TCU program in the past two years. “I’ve never been a part of a team that I just love so much, that I love to play with, love to work for. It means everything.” \nIt is a fit for TCU and Green. He’s just glad he found it. \n“I’ve always known what I can do,” he said. “I just knew that it was a matter of time when I got my opportunity that I would shine.” \nNo. 3 TCU at Iowa State \n6 p.m. Saturday, ESPN2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:02:23.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
