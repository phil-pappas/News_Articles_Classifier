FOOTBALL ROUNDUP: Donohue sparks Cohasset Jack Donohue scored three TDs in the third quarter Friday night as the Skippers blanked Pope John Paul II, 24-0, at home. Comment The Patriot Ledger, Quincy, MA By Staff reports   10:40 PM Updated at 10:48 PM   10:40 PM Updated at 10:48 PM Senior captain Jack Donohue did a little bit of everything Friday night in leading the Cohasset High football team to a 24-0 home win over Pope John Paul II. Donohue, a tight end/defensive end, accounted for all three Skippers touchdowns – two on catches (of 5 and 40 yards) and one on a 55-yard fumble return. He also defended three passes and made two tackles for losses for Cohasset (4-1). “He had a monster game,” coach Pete Afanasiw said. Senior kicker Henry Butenschoen kicked a 27-yard field goal for the only points of the first half and then was 3 for 3 on PATs as the Skippers broke the game open on Donohue’s trio of third-quarter TDs. Cole Sullivan added seven tackles, a sack and a blocked punt. He also forced the fumble that Donohue returned for a score. “It was a little bit of conditioning,” Afanasiw said of Cohasset’s second-half explosion. “We wore them down. (Pope John Paul) had a lot of guys playing both ways. “We also made some subtle halftime adjustments that paid off.” In other high school football action: Scituate 42, Pembroke 8: The Sailors (3-2, 2-1) rolled to a Patriot League Fisher Division road win over the Titans (0-5, 0-3) as Colin May (7 carries for 101 yards) had TD runs of 6 and 57 yards.
