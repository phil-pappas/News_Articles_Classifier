The ACVB will foot the bill for the winner’s airfare while various area hotels and attractions stepped up to cover other parts of the trip, Moore said. It was brief exposure worth an estimated $100,000 with an audience reach of 6.7 million, the show’s promotional agency told ACVB.\nMoore said it made sense to advertise the state on a show hosted by Harris, an Albuquerque native.\n“Absolutely, we liked the connection and wanted to support this New Mexican,” Moore said in an email.\nThis is a scene from the “New Mexico True” advertising campaign touting the state as a tourism destination.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/mb05_jd_17dec_2tourbiz-650x334.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/BC-US-TV-Neil-Patrick-Harris-ref1-400x266.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T14:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:44:13.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
