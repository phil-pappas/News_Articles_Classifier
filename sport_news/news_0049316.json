It was a match in which the Ranbir Kapoor co-owned franchise dominated the proceedings and would rue the fact that they could not manage more than a point from the match. While Blasters are in third place on the league table at the moment with four points from two outings, the Mumbai side logged home their first points in the cash-rich tournament. For Mumbai, their player-cum-manager Nicolas Anelka was out of action due to flu and there were as many as six changes in their side. While forward Subash Singh won Man of the Match award for his steady show upfront, Mohun Bagan goalkeeper and their I-League hero Debjeet Majumdar playing his first match for the ISL team also was impressive under the bar. Kerala Blasters however replaced last match’s scorer Mohammed Rafi with former India international Manandeep Singh, a reason that was left unexplained. Subash started up front instead of last match goal scorer Piquionne with Saran Singh. Mumbai were on attack at the outset as their Haitian winger Sony Norde looked particularly threatening and Blasters’ Peter Ramage had to be alert to keep out a dangerous cross from the Haitian as early as in the second minute of the match. sports football ISl 2 Kerala Blasters Mumbai City FC Also Read FIFA World Cup 2014: Pakistan sweats for players to have a ball Antoine Griezmann grills Levante French Open: Semi-finals set for slugfests FIFA World Cup 2014: ‘Gutted’ Wayne Rooney apologises to fans on Facebook", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151011/sports-football/article/isl-2-kerala-mumbai-dull-stalemate", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/football_29_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_17_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/football_29_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_17_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif"], "published": "2015-10-12T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:29:28.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
