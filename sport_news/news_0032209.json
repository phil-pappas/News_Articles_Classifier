I'm not really sure what happened.\" \nOn Feb. 16, only four teams in the American Hockey League had more points. Milwaukee led the Midwest Division and was second in the Western Conference. But the Admirals' streak of 12 straight seasons of reaching the playoffs ended after they took last place in the division. \n\"There's always responsibility from everybody when something like that happens,\" Admirals coach Dean Evason said. \"There's responsibility all around and we think we've addressed a lot of it and look forward to putting it into play.\" \nMilwaukee opens its 2015-'16 season Saturday at Chicago and the coach thinks one of the reasons his squad can return to the postseason is improved depth. \n\"I think you'll see more balance within our four lines and our six defensemen on any given night,\" Evason said. \"We have eight defensemen here now, we have 14 forwards here. We've got some tough decisions to make, which is awesome. Because that means that we have depth. \n\"I think that'll be the difference that you'll see. Our group will play the same, but we've got a real good balance from within our entire group.\" \nIt will be needed, considering only three of Milwaukee's top 10 scorers return from last season. The top two, Viktor Arvidsson and Austin Watson as well as Anthony Bitetto (he was seventh) made Nashville's roster this season. \nBut that's minor-league sports â€” develop players to advance to the next level. \n\"It's awesome,\" Evason said. \"It's rewarding for the whole organization.\" \nSissons is Milwaukee's returning leading scorer. He had 42 points last season and 25 goals in each of his first two years with the Admirals. Sissons also was named captain earlier this week. \n\"I wanted it, I pride myself in leadership,\" Sissons said. \"It's a huge honor and I'm super pumped to be the leader of this team.\" \nFord, the coach: Scott Ford, who spent six-plus seasons with Milwaukee and was a captain for two of them, is now an assistant coach with the team. \nFord appeared in 12 games with the Admirals last year and said he turned down some possible professional tryout contracts to become a coach. \n\"To step away from the game and get into a position with an organization I'm comfortable with, it was a great opportunity ... to find the next chapter in my life,\" Ford said. \"It seemed like a no-brainer at the time.\" \nGo to the tape: Coaches now can call for a video review but only if they have their one timeout available. \n\"It'll be interesting,\" Evason said. \"The one camera we use is over the top (of the goal), so I don't know what else we can review. But I guess we'll wait and see. It's good for coaches, nice to have that option to do that. We'll see how it plays out at our level. Clearly we don't have the buildings, the cameras, the access the NHL has.\" \nNew division: The Pacific Division was created and includes new teams Bakersfield, Ontario, San Diego, San Jose and Stockton. \nBecause they are located so far away from the rest of the AHL teams, they will play eight fewer games. As a result, the top four teams in each division ranked by points percentage (points earned divided by points available) will qualify for the playoffs. \nBesides Milwaukee, Charlotte, Chicago, Grand Rapids, Iowa, Lake Erie, Manitoba and Rockford are in the Central Division. ROSTER \nPlayers are listed with number, followed by height, weight and last season's team.
