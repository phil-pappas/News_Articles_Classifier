Oct 24, 2015 at 10:50p ET 0Shares \nThe Wisconsin men's hockey squad made a late charge, but eventually was dealt a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Ferris State on Saturday night, in Big Rapids, Mich. \nWisconsin (0-3-3) tied things at 1-all early in Saturday's third period, but Ferris State (2-2-2) scored a key, rebound goal just 19 seconds later at Ewigleben Arena. \nFerris State's Ryker Killins scored on the power play at the six-minute mark of the second period, and the Bulldogs later got the game winner from Chad McDonald 48 seconds into the third period. \nWisconsin's Matt Jurusik made 37 saves, marking the second time in his last three games that he posted 37 or more stops. \nThe Badgers went 1 for 5 on the man advantage, giving Wisconsin at least one power-play tally in four of its first six games. Six of the Badgers' 12 goals have now come on the power play. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:27:50.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
