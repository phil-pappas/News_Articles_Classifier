Lee's Caroline Moore earned individual medalist honors with a one-under 72-71-143. \nMoore's 36-hole score set a new tournament scoring record as the Flames' team score of 609 also set a new tournament benchmark. \nFranziska Bremm (West Georgia), Savannah Payne (West Alabama), Stephanie Bennett (West Georgia), Sam Burrus (Lee) and Hannah Solesbee (North Georgia) joined Moore on the All-Tournament Team. \nWest Georgia (610) posted a new tournament record single round team score of 300 in the final round and fell just a stroke shy of Lee for first place. West Alabama finished third with a 624. \nUNG held its spot with a final round 324 to finish fourth out of nine teams with a 316-624-640. \nSolesbee was the Nighthawks' top scorer for the second consecutive day as the freshman followed up her opening round 73 with a four-over 77 for a 150, good for a tie for fifth out of 56 golfers. \nThe second annual event is being held to honor LeeAnn Noble, a member of the UNG women's golf team that passed away in March of 2014 following a lengthy battle with heart complications. \nNorth Georgia wraps up the fall portion of the schedule when the team travels to St. Augustine, Fla. to take part in the Flagler Fall Slam.
