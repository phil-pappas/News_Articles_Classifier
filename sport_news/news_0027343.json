Christoffer Nygaard and Marco Sørensen drove an almost faultless race in the Aston Martin Racing entered Young Driver AMR-Aston Martin Vantage GTE and finished fifth in class after six hours of racing. For the third time in the last four rounds, Young Driver AMR was the highest-placed Aston Martin team in the GTE Pro class. Due to heavy rain, the race started behind the behind the safety car in difficult conditions. After 40 minutes behind the safety car, the race was eventually green flagged and starting driver Marco Sørensen began to make up positions and soon moved up to fifth place after starting seventh. Similar to the last rounds, the Young Driver AMR-Aston Martin was soon leading the GTE Pro Aston Martin trio, but wasnt able to race the Porsche and Ferrari at the front. After six hours with a perfect strategy, clean pit work and a only a minor spin which only cost a few of seconds, Young Driver AMR finished fifth and was the best highest placed Aston Martin team in the Japanese WEC round. This race was one of our strongest as a team, said Young Driver AMR´s Jan Struve after the race. We were spot on with our strategy and had great pit stops, made always the right decisions, had always the right tires on the car and Christoffer and Marco performed great in difficult conditions. Unfortunately the performance break we received prior to this weekend was obviously not enough. With our excellent race, we again ended up as best placed Aston Martin, but again we had no fair chance to race our competitors. Obviously, fifth place is nothing what we are looking for, but thanks everybody again for their hard work. The FIA WEC will stay in Far East and will start for the seventh and penultimate round of this season in Shanghai/China on November 1st.
