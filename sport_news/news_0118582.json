Natalie Weidenbach scored on a first-half free kick, and teammate Miranda Fischer redirected a corner kick into the goal early in the second half, propelling the Wildcats to a 2-1 victory over the Skyline Spartans in a Class 4A KingCo Conference girls soccer match Sept. 29 at Skyline High School. \nIt was an important win for the Wildcats, who bounced back from a 2-0 loss to Redmond and evened their KingCo record at 1-1. \n“The top three teams right now are Eastlake, Skyline and Issaquah, so beating one of them is going to help us with momentum,” said Weidenbach, a junior captain. “We really needed that, especially after losing to Redmond, and now I’m just ready to get on with them. I think we’re one of the contenders that can make it to playoffs.” \nConversely, it was a difficult loss for Skyline, which fell to 1-1 in KingCo. Each team plays eight conference games, with six of nine squads making the playoffs, and that magnifies the importance of each match. \nCoach Don Braman said he was pleased with many aspects of Skyline’s performance, but the Spartans made two defensive mistakes and failed to convert enough of their own chances. They outshot the Wildcats, 24-10. \n“I was really impressed with the speed of transition there, and the passing was excellent – it was all really quick, like we want to play,” Braman said. “And then for whatever reason, we go away from that sometimes. It’s disappointing when we create opportunities and we don’t finish the way that we need to.” \nSkyline peppered the Mount Si goal throughout the match, but senior goalkeeper Nellie Joselyn came up with nine saves, including a tremendous one-handed stop on Lindsey Fujiwara’s stinging drive late in second-half stoppage time. \nThe Wildcats’ defense bent but didn’t break, and Joselyn credited her teammates for preserving the win. \n“Honestly, it had a lot to do with my defense,” she said. “They were working their butts off all night long, especially (center back) Camryn Buck. She was giving it everything that she had.” \nSkyline’s Alessandra Zonta nearly scored in the 10th minute after stealing the ball and breaking into the penalty area. But her shot glanced off the near-side post. \nMount Si had a 12th-minute goal negated by the offside flag, but Weidenbach put her team in front in the 26th minute when she snuck a 20-yard free kick under two defenders and past diving goalkeeper Anna Smith. \n“I heard the people in the wall go, ‘Let’s start jumping,’” Weidenbach explained. “So I was like, ‘OK, near post on the ground sounds like a good idea.’ I was just hoping I’d time it right so I wouldn’t hit their feet.” \nThe 1-0 lead nearly lasted until halftime, but Skyline struck for the equalizer in the 39th minute when Emma Rohleder collected a long ball down the left sideline and crossed to Julia Mitchell, who one-touched a shot past Joselyn. \nBut the Wildcats responded just two minutes into the second half. Makayla Turpin’s corner kick from the right side found an unmarked Fischer at the near post, and Fischer buried her chance. \nSkyline’s defensive group, which is comprised almost entirely of first-year varsity players, wasn’t to blame for the two goals allowed, Braman said. \n“You look at the goals we give up today, that’s not about my back four. That’s about our response on set pieces. \n“We really like the contributions they’re making,” he said of the Spartans’ back line. “They’re talking well, they’re adjusting and they’re working as a unit. We just need some maturity. … The more we work together, the more that’ll come.” Other Stories of Interest: Alessandra Zonta , Anna Smith , Camryn Buck , Don Braman , Emma Rohleder , Julia Mitchell , Lindsey Fujiwara , Makayla Turpin , Miranda Fischer , Mount Si High School girls soccer , Natalie Weidenbach , Nellie Joselyn , Skyline High School girls soccer \nWritten by Neil Pierson · Filed Under Soccer , Sports \nCopyright © 2015 by Issaquah Press Inc.
