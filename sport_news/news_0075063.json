It’s not serious, but a source said he wouldn’t have been able to play today against the Cowboys if needed. However, Fletcher was a healthy scratch in Week 3 against the Jaguars after falling behind cornerback Justin Coleman on the depth chart.\nQuarterbacks Ben Roethlisberger and Tyrod Taylor were 8-of-10 for 129 yards and one touchdown when targeting Fletcher, who was also flagged once for pass interference.\nFletcher signed a one-year contract this offseason that included a $300,000 signing bonus. The deal could have been worth up to $2.5 million if Fletcher reached all of his playing-time incentives.\nIt’s unclear right now whether Fletcher’s release was more about the injury or his performance. The Pats’ decision whether or not to re-sign him in a week or two will determine that.\nThe Patriots promoted special teamer Brandon King from the practice squad to take Fletcher’s spot on the 53-man roster.\nRespect up front\nThe Patriots’ defensive thumpers understand they’re preparing for quite possibly their greatest challenge of the season as they encounter the Cowboys’ sturdy offensive line.\nIt’s been about a year since the Cowboys have earned the reputation for the league’s best line, and the Pats have certainly recognized that this week. Their eyes widen when discussing the task of breaking through the fortress.\n“They have a lot of good individuals on their offensive line, but they work together,” said defensive end Chandler Jones , who has three sacks this season. “It’s one thing to have great individual players, but another thing to have a whole bunch of good individual players working well together. That’s what they show on film a lot.”\nThe Cowboys’ unified performance was mentioned by every defensive player who discussed the topic, and in turn, the Patriots said they can’t be freelancing in order to create pressure. The coordinated rushes and blitz calls must be executed by every lineman and linebacker to get home against quarterback Brandon Weeden , who has been taken down five times in 64 drop-backs.\n“Everyone has to work together, play assignment football and be in the right spots,” Jones said.\nWeeden also has a greater propensity for panicking than injured starter Tony Romo , who was only sacked three times in 75 drop-backs. Similar to the case with Tom Brady and the Patriots’ young offensive line, good quarterback play can mask issues, and vice versa.\n“Everybody is as good as the guy next to them,” defensive lineman Dominique Easley said. “If you work well with the guy next to you, I think everything will fall into place perfectly, but everybody has to work as a unit — not just the offensive line, not just the quarterback, not just the running back, wide receivers, everybody.”\nInterestingly, the Cowboys had the second-best rushing attack last season when DeMarco Murray was still in town. This season, with Joseph Randle and Darren McFadden getting the bulk of the carries, they’re 16th in rushing yards. Some of that, one might suspect, is the talent of the players behind the line, so the Pats might have more opportunities to make plays if they can create some penetration.\nRegardless of who has the ball, though, the Pats weren’t ready to take anything away from the Cowboys’ big hogs up front.\n“Whether or not (it’s Romo or Weeden), their offensive line is a good offensive line,” linebacker Dont’a Hightower said.\nEasley added, “We’ve got to work together as a team. Everybody has to do their job. Nobody can mess up, that’s all.”\nAin’t that a kick\nStephen Gostkowski is one of just nine kickers who has made each of their boots this season, including all field goals and extra points. He is the only one in that group with at least seven field goals and 14 extra points.\nSo essentially, in a league plagued by bad kicking, the Patriots can be happy they’ve got the highest-paid kicker at their disposal.\nAnd for what it’s worth, Gostkowski was voted as the league’s best kicker by his peers in an ESPN poll. Gostkowski was cited by 18 of the 24 kickers who were surveyed last week.\n“Obviously it’s nice to be respected,” Gostkowski said. “I respect a lot of guys. I don’t look at it that way. I’m just glad to be on a good team.” . . .\nRookie defensive end Trey Flowers did not make the trip and won’t play today. Flowers has been limited this week in practice due to knee and shoulder injuries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:36:37.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
