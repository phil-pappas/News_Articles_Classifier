The school district packed into Byron's gym to give the Tiger teams a big celebration assembly. \n\"Going into state we knew we had a really good chance,\" junior Trent Snodgrass said. \"We just played our game, played as a team and because of that we won state.\" \nThe community support has been big for the Tigers. \n\"It was great,\" junior Abby Richardson said. \"I didn't think we would get support from all the district. Everybody was here. We made it super far and it was impressive to have everybody here for us.\" \nIn the 2-A ranks, Auburn sophomore Madasyn Pettersen won the individual state championship. She won by one stroke over a couple of other golfers in the field. \nPettersen has won some other big tournaments in her career, but this one has a special place for her. \n\"There's a lot of pressure because you're representing your school and it's not just yourself,\" Pettersen said. \"It's different when I'm playing for myself and just for fun. This is actually for something. People care a lot about this one.\" \nPettersen will go to Arizona for the winter to continue working on her golf game.
