Peterson was forced into action late in last week’s game after Jefferson lost RVC leading rusher and starting senior quarterback Jack Cincotta to a broken ankle. \nThe loss didn’t keep the Eagles from earning their ninth consecutive trip to the WIAA playoffs. Jefferson (3-6 overall) will be a No. 8 seed and will travel to top-seeded Monona Grove (8-1) for a Division 3 Level 1 game this Friday. Kickoff at Klement Stadium is 7 p.m. \nBefore their playoff matchup, Jefferson head coach Steve Gee said the loss of Cincotta forced the Eagles to revert back to a double-wing set formation, an offensive scheme that they have not used in two years. The scheme is also what the junior varsity and freshmen team run. \n“We thought that was a safe scheme for the week and it was,” Gee said. “The playbook was a little bit smaller than it normally would have been, and we were not being super creative.” \nGee and his coaching staff thought this would allow Peterson to be more comfortable, but the change in scheme did not mean a drop in production, with running backs Hunter Milbrath and Jacob Arnold combining for 48 rushing attempts for 339 yards. \nThe Eagles struck first on a 17-yard Milbrath touchdown run, and he also punched in a 2-point conversion giving Jefferson an 8-0 lead midway through the first quarter. \nMilbrath finished with three touchdowns in 21 attempts for a career-high 177 yards. \nThe Trojans (7-2) did not waste anytime responding on the ensuing kickoff, as Juan Reyes sprinted his way for an 85-yard touchdown to bring his team with one at 8-7. \nThe first quarter continued to be explosive with less than 15 seconds left Milbrath took a reverse to the house on a 75-yard touchdown run. A failed run on the 2-point conversion set the Eagles up for a 14-7 point lead. \nReyes became more of a pain in Jefferson’s side as the game went on, taking over for senior quarterback Seth Smith after a scoreless drive in the second quarter. \nReyes’ addition changed BT’s offensive set that focused on him running the ball almost exclusively out of the shotgun along side of the 6-foot-4 220-pound senior back Justin Hansen. \n“We were kitchen sink-ing them,” Gee said about trying to stop Reyes. “We had seen that formation before and we were trying to bring guys and I think we will see on film that sometimes there were guys there and we didn’t make the play we needed to.” \nThe change at quarterback for Turner proved to be the correct call as on the next drive Reyes ran for a 4-yard touchdown to even the score at 14-14 with 6:49 left in the half. \nJefferson took over and marched down the field behind the legs of Milbrath and Arnold on a drive that started on their own 31. Despite two false start penalties inside the red zone, Arnold scored a 6-yard touchdown with 13 seconds left that gave the Eagles a 20-14 lead after another failed two point conversion. \nTurner’s Smith started back at quarterback on the opening drive of the second half, but a quick three-and-out gave the ball back to Jefferson and their rushing attack. \nThe Eagle’s offense grinded down the field for a 6-minute drive that ended in another Milbrath touchdown to take a 28-14 lead with 4:32 to go in the quarter. \nBeloit Turner continued a special season under first-year head coach Derek Diehl as they went back to Reyes taking the snaps in the shotgun. Hansen brought them within one score at 28-21 with a 1-yard touchdown in the first minute of the final quarter. \nJefferson had a chance to possibly close out the game, but was stuffed on a fourth-and-goal from the Turner 1-yard line with 8 minutes remaining in the game. \nThe Turner comeback was completed as they took the ball 99 yards, highlighted by a 65-yard run by Hansen and a 16-yard touchdown run by Reyes to push the game to overtime. \nThree plays before the game-tying touchdown, on a fourth-and-1 from their 16-yard line, a controversial call did not go Jefferson’s way. It appeared Beloit had a false start as a few linemen broke their stance, but after the referees huddled they explained the ref had not taken his hand off the ball to start the game clock. \n“That wasn’t the greatest call in the world that got called on fourth down, and obviously we got stuffed,” Gee said. “That makes it a different game. Every football game has those type of moments where you look back and say ‘this was it’ and that was a big one.” \nTurner took the ball first in overtime, and in two plays Hansen broke off a 20-yard touchdown run. Reyes ran the 2-point conversion giving the Trojans a 36-28 lead. \nAlthough Jefferson had success moving the ball in overtime, the botched snap was recovered by the Trojan’s Ethan Burns inside the 1-yard line. \n“(Peterson) was pretty nervous this week and we wanted to stay positive with him,” Gee said. “He is only a sophomore so he will have a couple years to do this stuff and he’ll look back on this and be better for it. I am sure he is going to feel pretty bad for awhile, but he will bounce back.” \nAs the playoffs approach, Gee said the message to his team is to put the loss behind them. \n“I think the motivation to finish is what we will take away from this game,” Gee said. “We had a lead at half and an opportunity to put it away and hopefully they get motivation for the guys next week to close out games” \nBeloit Turner also qualified for the WIAA playoffs. The Trojans, a No. 6 seed, travel to No. 3 Columbus (8-1) Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:36:37.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
