(Donetta Godsey/Courier) Posted: Monday, October 19, 2015 5:19 pm Viking tennis players takes fourth and 12th at state By OLIVIA HASELWOOD Courier Sports Reporter sports@winfieldcourier.com winfieldcourier.com | 0 comments For the second year in a row, high school tennis players from across the state converged on Winfield for the 4A state tennis tournament. Winfield had four players qualify, three of whom ended the tournament with medals. The team as a whole tied for third with three other teams. “I was very proud of all the girls on how they competed this weekend. Megan, Mallory and Jenna will remember this state tournament for a lot of years, and we will miss them next year more than you know,” coach Brian Shaw said. Winfield’s number one doubles team of Jenna Groene and Mallory Meier battled for third after falling to McPherson earlier in the day. The Vikings defeated a team from Buhler to walk away with bronze. “Mallory and Jenna got a little revenge from when they took out the state champs from last year, Nachtigal/Steffen 6-3, 0-6, 7-6(8) to earn that third place medal. What a heck of a way to finish out their senior season for the lady Vikings,” Shaw said. kA 4=2DDlQAbQm$2C29 w2>>6C =65 E96 H2J :?
