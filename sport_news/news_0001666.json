But Sara Marston of Naperville left the Ashbury homeowners association meeting Monday evening with no response from the group except to thank her for her perspective, she said after exiting the clubhouse. At issue is Nick Thomas' Halloween decorations, which in past years have taken up nearly every square inch of his yard on a cul-de-sac on Conan Doyle Drive in the south Naperville subdivision. The homeowners association in September prohibited owners from placing holiday decorations on more than 50 percent of their yards and limited decoration display times to no more than 30 days before or after any holiday. After the rule was enacted, Thomas decided not to display any of the decorations that turn his yard into a spooky cemetery complete with lights and music. Sara told homeowners association leaders that an online petition she created in favor of changing the rule to allow Thomas' all-out display gathered 8,600 signatures. Thomas, who also decorates heavily for Christmas, said Monday he hopes the issue with the new homeowners association rule can be resolved in time to put up his winter decorations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:56:45.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
