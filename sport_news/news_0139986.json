(Syracuse University Athletics) Comments \nSyracuse, N.Y. -- This could be the year that Syracuse University men's cross country team makes a little history. \nThe Orange men are positioned to make a run at a national championship, having been ranked No. 2 in the country the past few weeks. \nFor perspective, the last time the team won a national championship in cross country was in 1951. Coach Chris Fox said he'd rank his top three runners, from left, Justyn Knight; Martin Hehir, center, and Colin Bennie, far right, against any team in the nation. Syracuse University Athletics \nLast year's surprise win at the prestigious Wisconsin Meet of Champions , followed by a fifth-place finish at the NCAAs at Indiana State, made for a great season. This year's team shows even more promise. \nOn Oct. 16, the squad again won the Wisconsin meet to no one's surprise. This year the team is eyeing a third straight Atlantic Coast Conference title, and fourth straight conference title. In 2012, they were big East Champions before switching conferences. \nThe Orange women's squad, which is also coached by Fox, is also having another good season. They're currently ranked 16th in country among Division I schools. The team's top runner is Margo Malone, a senior from Pittsburgh. \nRunners on the men's team are well aware that to become national champions they must beat the University of Colorado, which last year won the NCAAs and is once again ranked No. 1 in the country. The two squads won't meet this year until the NCAA championship meet, set for Nov. 21 in Louisville, Kentucky. Meanwhile, there the ACC championship meet is set Oct. 30 at Florida State University at Tallahassee, Fla. \nFox is very careful not to put too much pressure on his runners, noting that the stated goal at the beginning of this season is a \"podium finish\" â€“ namely, to be among the top four squads in the Division I finale. The last time that happened, he said, was a fourth place finish in 1957. \n\"Basically, we got our whole group back. We lost one guy (Max Straneva) out of our top six,\" he said. \"Our first three guys are just as good as anyone in the country right now.\" Those top three, in order of their recent finishes, are sophomore Justyn Knight; Martin Hehir, a 5th year senior and Colin Bennie, a sophomore. The three finished second, fourth and sixth, respectively at the recent Wisconsin Invitational. \nFox calls Hehir \"the best runner in the history of Syracuse University,\" adding that Knight is also \"well on his way\" to claiming that title. \nHehir, who stands 6 feet, 1 inch and weighs 140 pounds, is from Washingtonville, N.Y. He has been the top runner on the team for his past three competitive seasons after he red-shirted his freshman year in cross country. He was ranked top in the county last spring in the 10,000 meters in track (28:27), but faded to 13th place (29:47) in the finals at the NCAAs at the University of Oregon , citing allergy problems. Orange harrier Justyn Knight is the team's top runner at this point. Martin Hehir, his teammate calls him a \"phenom.\" Syracuse University Athletics \nIn his final year of cross country at S.U. and intent on going to medical school after graduation, he's found himself second fiddle to Knight, a Toronto, Canada native, who's coming into his own, \"out-kicking me and Colin.\" \nKnight, who stands 5 foot, 10 inches and weighs 130 pounds, said he originally had plans to play basketball when he was younger, and only ran his first cross country race as a junior in high school. \nThe more he ran, the more he became convinced (and convinced others) of his running talent. The summer following his senior year of high school, Knight ran the 5,000 meters at the World Junior Track and Field Championships, finishing eighth. He also holds the Canadian junior mile record (3:59.51). \n\"He's a phenom,\" Hehir said of his teammate. \nFox is quick to say there's \"no tricks,\" or changes to his coaching technique this year. He said the team's motto is TCB, which stands for \"Take Care of Business.\" \nHis coaching style takes into consideration the individual talents and physical tolerances of his runners. He doesn't believe in weight training, but does push his runners to do\" pretty extensive core exercises, with some pushups, \" Hehir said. \n\"Coach is old fashioned. Do you want to get better in running? Go for a run,\" Heher said. \"His approach is that us runners know our bodies best and that (his role) is to guide us through training. He allows a lot of autonomy on our easy days.\" \nAsked about the mileage demands on his runners during training, Fox said most of his runners average 70 to 90 miles a week. The motto for both the S.U. men's and women's cross county teams is TCB -- \"Take Care of Business.\" David Figura | dfigura@syracuse.com \n\"However, two of our top three runners (Hehir and Bennie) run about 90 miles a week. One (Knight) runs 50 to 55,\" he said. \"It all depends on the person.\" \nHehir said every year there is a little bit different chemistry on the squad. \n\"This year, we've gotten a little more singularly minded. We're living the right life, wanting to be great. It may sound corny, but it makes a big difference,\" he said. \"As for a national championship, coach tries to avoid that kind of pressure. We kind of put it on ourselves.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:17:53.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
