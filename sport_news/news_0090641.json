That same year, 1974, Holland reached the World Cup final where they were defeated by West Germany. \nFour years later Cruyff moved to the United States where he played for the Los Angeles Aztecs and the Washington Diplomats the following year. He finished his career in the Netherlands with two more seasons with Ajax and one with Feyenoord. \nCruyff took over as manager of Ajax in 1985 but it was his return to Barcelona in 1988 that brought him success as a coach, the 'Dream Team' winning four league titles, the European Cup and a Copa del Rey and devising the swift passing possession that later became known as tiki-taka. \nSince leaving BarÃ§a in 1996 he has had various minor roles in the game and acts as an adviser to Ajax, a spell notable for his successful attempt to block his fellow directors from appointing Louis van Gaal to the board by taking them to court.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:36:32.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
