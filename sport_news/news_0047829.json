Comment   Will Gilbert Posted Sep. 30, 2015 at 10:00 AM Updated at 3:33 PM Posted Sep. 30, 2015 at 10:00 AM Updated at 3:33 PM Heber Springs Behind an inspired, gritty effort from the Panther offensive line, Heber Springs senior running back Eddie Torres ran with the destruction his nickname indicates Friday night in the 2-4A Conference opener at Panther Stadium. Torres rolled up 217 yards rushing on 17 carries and scored two touchdowns, including the game-winning score with 1:20 left in the fourth quarter as the Panthers shocked No. 5 ranked Lonoke 20-19. Shifting from slot back to tailback in place of injured junior Caleb Lanclos, Torres ran with tremendous tenacity, often turning short gains into big plays. “Torres is patient and he does a great job following Luke [McGowan],” said Panther Coach Darren Gowen. “Eddie asked for the ball and I said I am giving it to you. He just lowered his head and ran through people. Torres ran like a wild man.” Bolstered up front by offensive linemen Dylan Platt, Luke McGowan, Spencer Greene, Billy Bodron, Cody Sparlin, plus fullback Nate Dew, the Panthers pounded the ball between the tackles most of the evening. “Dew was leading and Spencer Greene was wrapping and Platt, coming off an injury played through pain and showed incredible leadership. He is playing with pain and he is the leader on the offensive line. We just ran it right down their throats on that last drive,” said Gowen. Lonoke took its first lead of the game on a third and 12 screen pass from quarterback Will Miller to receiver Jawaun Bryant, who slipped a tackle near the line of scrimmage and skirted down the left sideline for a 19-yard touchdown, capping an 8-play, 81-yard drive. Heber stuffed the conversion, leaving Lonoke’s lead at 19-14 with 6:41 remaining. “When they took the lead after we got that touchdown called back I was interested to see how we would respond and we just drove it right down the field,” said Gowen. “The line stepped up and we were the most physical team tonight. We got down to the goal line and ran power and power and power again. That has been our bread and butter since I’ve been here.” Heber’s game-winning drive spanned 71 yards in 14 plays. Torres contributed 58 yards on nine carries, including an 8-yard run up the middle on fourth and short at the Heber 38. Facing a third and three, Torres bounced around right end for seven yards and two plays later Torres used a jump cut to find room around right side, where he raced 25 yards to the Lonoke 5. Following a 2-yard keeper from sophomore quarterback Brandon Loethen, Torres took a handoff up the middle and fearlessly dove over the goal line for a 3-yard touchdown. The Jackrabbits stopped Torres short of the end zone on the conversion, leaving the Panthers’ lead at 20-19 with 1:20 left to play. Page 2 of 3 - Down to its last gasp, Lonoke moved near midfield on an 8-yard completion from Miller to Bryant before Heber clinched the victory when Pierce Mitchum intercepted a pass over the middle. Heber made an early statement following an interception by junior defensive back Sam Lee, who returned the ball 30 yards to the Lonoke 45, where the Panthers embarked on an 8-play scoring drive. On third and three, Torres escaped a defender near the line of scrimmage and darted around left end for 10 yards and a fresh set of downs. Mitchum added 20 more yards, taking a direct snap around right end. Three plays later after Heber suffered an illegal motion penalty, Loethen ran through a tackler at the 5-yard line and plowed through two more defenders inside the 2 to reach the end zone from seven yards out. Torres kicked the extra-point, giving the Panthers a 7-0 lead with 5:53 left in the first quarter. The Jackrabbits responded with a 15-play, 76-yard drive that culminated in a 15-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Logan Dozier to Bryant. Casey Martin added the extra-point, tying the score at 7-all with 11:15 left in the first half. The Panthers reclaimed the lead in the third quarter after junior defensive back Joey “Tank” Foster recovered a fumble at the Lonoke 24. Following a 9-yard run by Mitchum, Torres bounced around left end, broke a tackle at the 12 and raced into the end zone for a 15-yard touchdown with 8:03 left in the third quarter.Torres’ PAT pushed the Panthers’ lead to 14-7. Lonoke flipped a fumble into six points later in the third quarter. Brendan Reed pounced on the loose ball at the Heber 2 and the ’Rabbits scored on their first snap as tailback Josh Coleman powered over left guard. Heber junior linebacker Steele Spicer stuffed Coleman on the two-point conversion, preserving the Panthers’ 14-13 lead with 4:55 left in the third quarter. Heber countered with a 13-play, 77-yard drive that stalled out after Mitchum’s 12-yard touchdown run off a reverse was called back due to an illegal block. Lonoke quickly gained momentum on a 53-yard run by Martin, who dashed around right end. Coleman churned out two yards on fourth and short to keep the drive alive and Lonoke cashed in three plays later on Bryant’s catch and run. But the Panthers wouldn’t be denied, answering with the game-winning drive that chewed up over five minutes. Riddled with injuries in its first three non-conference games, Platt returned for the Panthers, who played without senior quarterback Hunter Chandler, who is expected to miss three to five more weeks. Balancing out the injury situation, Lonoke played without star scat back/receiver Justin Meadows, who scored three touchdowns in the Jackrabbits’ season-opening win over Star City, which was ranked No. 2 at the time. Page 3 of 3 - Lonoke finished with 260 yards of total offense, one more yard than Heber (259). “I can’t be more proud of our coaches and players,” said Heber Coach Darren Gowen. “Coach [Caleb] Shock and Coach [E.G.] Dew came up with a great defensive game plan and we executed it very well. We told them if we can make them drive it, it’s going to be tough for them.” Heber, which entered the game as an 11-point underdog according to Hootens.com , improved to 6-4 all-time versus Lonoke. All six times the Panthers beat Lonoke they advanced to the playoffs. “I told the kids I don’t care who thinks we can win or not if we play like we can we are going to win the football game,” said Gowen. “They had a few injuries tonight and we had a few but we fought through it. For the most part we executed incredibly well on defense and the offensive line just took over in the second half.” Dew led Heber with seven tackles, including five unassisted. Spicer followed with six (all solo). The Panthers (2-2, 1-0) travel to Stuttgart (2-2, 1-0), which defeated Southside Batesville 41-21 in its conference opener, on Friday.
