About 10 minutes into the contest, North Pocono's Brooke Bowman found Lacey Rinaldi in front of Honesdale's goal. Rinaldi worked her way through the defense, and poked a shot past Honesdale Goalkeeper, Maddie O'Hare in a one-on-one situation to put her team up a goal early. The Trojans kept up the offensive pressure from there, but the Hornets defense held fast, and didn't give up another goal for the remainder the half. The Lady Hornets got their offense going about thirty minutes in, when they began moving the ball in synch, making passes to the inside and back out to the perimeter working their way down the left side. Eventually the ball found Midfielder, Lauren O'Dell, who fired a high arcing shot from deep on the left side that sailed just high of North Pocono's goal. Just two minutes later on a similar play, O'Dell tried her luck once again. This time she launched another high arcing shot that landed over the head of North Pocono goalkeeper, Ashley Kamla, and in, evening the score at one goal apiece. The Hornets pushed the tempo after that working their way up field, but could not create any clean shots for the remainder of the half, resulting in a 1-1 tie score at the break. The Ladies of Troy came out firing after halftime. Just over a minute into the second half, Rinaldi picked up a steal and took the ball back the other way. Page 2 of 4 - After once again creating a one-on-one situation with O'Hare, she scored her second goal of the game, putting her team ahead 2-1. NP Pulls Away After another six minutes of the match ticked by, North Pocono once again threaded the ball inside Honesdale's box. After some confusion, the ball bounced around before landing at the feet of Rinaldi, who fired a shot to the right side of the goal. Despite the fact that she only got a piece of the ball on her strike, the shot was placed well enough to trickle past O'Hare, and in for a North Pocono goal, making it a 3-1 match. “ That third goal was a pivotal point in the game,” Honesdale head coach Eric Eisele admitted. “ Once we were down two, we began to try too hard, and overrunning the ball,” he added. “ It really took us out of our game.” Honesdale's scoring opportunities from that point forward were few and far between. One such opportunity arose with 20 minutes left to play in the game, when Honesdale midfielder, Abigail Panza collided with the Pocono keeper, Kamla, which as a result, diffused the swarm's final promising scoring chance of the day. The Trojans quickly added another two scores over the course of the next 10 minutes coming off the feet of Rinaldi and Rachel Lewis, giving their team a very comfortable four goal cushion. In the last few minutes of the game, it appeared as though North Pocono wanted to add yet another goal to their already substantial lead. Page 3 of 4 - Lacey's Laces The Trojans dominated possession time in the game's dwindling minutes, forcing O'Hare to make several difficult saves. This included a fully- extended diving stop that received cheers and praise from fans of both teams in the bleachers. Pocono's persistence finally paid off in the game's final seconds however, as Rinaldi tallied her final goal of the match upon receiving a short pass from the right side, bringing her total for the game to five. The talented female footballer also added ten steals on defense to compliment her dominant offensive performance, leading her team to a 6-1 victory. Coach's Comments “ To our girls' credit, they never put their heads down and they kept playing until the final buzzer. They win as a team and lose as a team,” Hornets assistant coach, Jamie Brown said. “ I'm a little surprised at the outcome. The score was certainly not indicative of what happened during the game, I actually thought we did a lot of things well tonight,” head coach Eric Eisele remarked. “ We have two games left on the schedule that we intend to go out and win,” he added. “ We're gonna work on a couple of things in practice this week, and come out next week ready to take care of business.” Honesdale falls to 1-6 with the league loss, while the Trojans improve to 8-5. Both teams will play Western Wayne for their next match.
