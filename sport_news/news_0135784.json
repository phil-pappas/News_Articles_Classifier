Marcus just quietly continues to work and when the opportunities come he takes advantage of them.\"His determination comes from his grandfather Joseph Hatchett - the first African-American elected to the Florida Supreme Court.\"Someone like that being in my family that broke down many barriers and really challenged lots of important people to get where he was that really means a lot to me,\" says Clark. \"Because it shows you can do anything.\"Not only has Clark changed his football positions - he's also changed his major from oceanic engineering to accounting.\"That's how he's embraced everything,\" says Partridge. \"Just figure out what's best for him and attack it with everything he's got.\"\"It's such a blessing to have a free education,\" adds Clark. \"And I feel like that's very rare and I want to take full advantage of it.\"And it's the same on the field - one of the smallest players has big goals.\"If it was about who's bigger an elephant would be king of the jungle, I feel like that's a very strong statement and I try to carry myself that way.\" FAU Who's Hoo - Marcus on the run \nWednesday, October 7 2015, 12:26 AM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:55:30.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
