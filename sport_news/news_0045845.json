(Photo: Andy Marlin, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCC Sabathia announced on Monday he is entering an alcohol rehabilitation center \"to receive the professional care and assistance I need to treat my disease,\" a surprising development on the eve of the New York Yankees' playoff opener. \nSabathia, 35, was a likely candidate to start an American League Division Series opener - or perhaps Game 2 - if the Yankees prevail in their wild card game against Houston on Monday. \nInstead, he will attack a personal problem that he only now is revealing to the public. \nâ€œI love baseball and I love my teammates like brothers, and I am also fully aware that I am leaving at a time when we should all be coming together for one last push toward the World Series,\" Sabathia said in a statement released by the Yankees shortly before their workout began Monday. \n\"It hurts me deeply to do this now, but I owe it to myself and to my family to get myself right. I want to take control of my disease, and I want to be a better man, father and player.\" Sabathia pitches against the Tigers in the 2011 ALDS.
