Carver 8: Can't count Wetumpka out Ethan Bernal , Montgomery Advertiser 11:06 p.m. CDT October 22, 2015 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Wetumpka beats Carver to make playoffs Ethan Bernal \nAfter Wetumpka's 17-8 victory over G.W. Carver at Cramton Bowl on Thursday, the victory sealing a playoff spot for the Indians, you could tell how much it meant to sophomore running back Kavosiey Smoke. \nWetumpka's workhorse back missed the first two games of the season with pneumonia, and watched his team get off to an 0-2 start. When he returned, it didn't get much better, as the Indians fell to 1-4 at the midway point. \nBut victories in three of the last four games have turned Wetumpka's season. Just like Smoke fought back from his illness, Wetumpka (4-5, 4-3 Class 6A, Region 2) fought back to continue its season. \n\"It means a lot. … It means a lot. They really helped me. They were like, 'I can't wait until you come back.' They really picked me up. I was like, 'I can't wait either.' We came back and now we're in the playoffs,\" Smoke said. \"And everybody doubted us, so it is what it is.\" \nSmoke led the Indians offense with 16 carries for 68 yards. However, his biggest play came through the air. On fourth down with 2 minutes left in a two-point game, quarterback Keldon Washington lofted the ball to Smoke in heavy traffic, and Smoke was able to come down with it and set up Deandre Williams' 1-yard touchdown run to ice the game. \nWilliams ran 11 times for 58 yards and scored both of Wetumpka's touchdowns. Will Digmon hit a 19-yard field goal. \nStill soaking from getting doused with ice water in the postgame celebration, Wetumpka coach Tim Perry couldn't have been more proud. \n\"When we were 1-4, it looked pretty bleak, and maybe a lot of people started to lose faith. But we just kept preaching and teaching to our guys, 'You can't listen to that. You've got to believe in what we're doing. You've got to believe in your teammates and in yourself,'\" Perry said. \"They listened to us, they bought in, and we're just peaking at the right time.\" \nCarver took a brief lead late in the first quarter. An 8-yard wide receiver reverse touchdown run by Darrian Steele, and a successful 2-point conversion, put the Wolverines ahead 8-7. \nCarver falls to 3-6 overall and 3-4 in region play. It's the first time the Wolverines have failed to reach the playoffs since 2007, and the first time in five years under coach Billy Gresham. \n\"Just missed opportunities. I felt like they played hard. This game was the storybook of our season,\" Gresham said. \"Even this week, we lose our starting center and starting right tackle early in the week. But our guys played hard, fought until the end. Just missed opportunities.\" Buy Photo Wetumpka's Trent Holley (50) helps dunk the cooler on Wetumpka's head coach Tim Perry as Wetumpka Defeated Carver 17-8 on Thursday, Oct. 22, 2015, at Cramton Bowl in Montgomery, Ala.
