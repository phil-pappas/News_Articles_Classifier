The BYU Cougars, Utah Utes and Utah State Aggies picked up huge victories. Here are some of the top plays from the wins. \nBYU's Algernon Brown ran straight up the middle on a draw play for a 53-yard touchdown. The scamper gave BYU a 35-21 lead over East Carolina. Brown finished the game with 134 yards rushing and four touchdowns. A. Brown run for 53 yds for a TD #BYUvsECU #GoCougs http://t.co/8WlfP62v4g — Daniel Haslam (@DanHaslam) October 11, 2015 \nBYU quarterback Tanner Mangum faked out an ECU defender with a pump fake and found a wide open Terenn Houk by the goal line. Mangum finished the game with over 300 yards passing, three touchdown passes and led BYU on a game-winning drive in the final minutes of the game. — Mike (@a01131119) October 12, 2015 \nTied 10-10 late in the second quarter, Utah quarterback Travis Wilson delivered a perfectly thrown ball to Cory Butler-Byrd streaking down the middle of the field for a 52-yard touchdown pass. \nUtah running back Devontae Booker ran through, around and all over Cal in Saturday night's win. He finished the game with 222 yards rushing and two touchdowns. \nUtah State's Devante Mays bounced off several Bulldog defenders in the backfield before breaking off a 41-yard touchdown run. Mays finished the game with three touchdowns in the Aggies' 56-14 win. Devonte Mays is pretty fast as well. #utahstate #goaggies https://t.co/CcgAQgBdc0 — Brendan Dennis (@B_Den1) October 11, 2015 \nUtah State quarterback Kent Myers found Devonte Robinson on a perfectly executed screen pass for a 44-yard catch and run. Robinson showed off his electric speed weaving in and out of Bulldog defenders on his way into the end zone. — Brendan Dennis (@B_Den1) October 11, 2015 0 Pending", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T07:10:19.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
