No charges were filed against Johnny Manziel last week when police questioned him after an argument with his girlfriend. Manziel was active Sunday when the Cleveland Browns played the Denver Broncos, but does that mean he is out of the woods in terms of disciplinary action?\nAdChoices Maybe not.\nMary Kay Cabot of Northeast Ohio Media Group believes the Browns will look further into Manziel’s latest off-field incident this week. It is unclear if Manziel is in the NFL’s substance abuse program because of his admitted history with alcohol, but the league could discipline him if he is since he told police he had been drinking.\nCabot added that the Browns will look into some of the allegations made by Manziel’s girlfriend, Colleen Crowley, and would not rule out the team cutting ties.\nI think they’ll also talk to him about some of the allegations made by his girlfriend in the police report to make sure there are no serious issues that need to be addressed. If the Browns are comfortable with Manziel drinking alcohol, I think they’ll ride it out. If they’re not, they’ll consider moving on.\nCrowley told police that Manziel grabbed her arm, but she later explained on Instagram that the situation was not as bad as it appeared . Dashboard camera footage that was released Monday appeared to show that Crowley was extremely rattled while speaking to police.\nThe Browns aren’t going to make any rash decisions, but there is plenty of reason to believe they are concerned about Manziel admitting he was drinking after he spent a significant time in alcohol rehab this past offseason.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://larrybrownsports.com/football/browns-serious-concerns-johnny-manziel/278436", "http://larrybrownsports.com/football/johnny-manziel-police-video-colleen-crowley/278594", "http://larrybrownsports.com/football/colleen-crowley-johnny-manziel-incident-argument/278197", "http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2015/10/will_the_browns_stick_by_johnn.html", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:32:07.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
