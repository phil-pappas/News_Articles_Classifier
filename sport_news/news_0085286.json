The Vols got Georgia two weeks ago. Now they'll try to take down the giant rival this weekend in Alabama. 'Built by Bama'. Even Vols coach Butch Jones might agree that's more than just a slogan for the Crimson Tide. \"They really resemble the difference of building a football team and building a football program that has stood the test of time. We're still building this football program at Tennessee. I know a lot of people don't want to hear it, but it's reality. It's the mind-set. It's the competitive culture of the football program. It's the confidence.\" At least the Vols will carry a winning expectation to Tuscaloosa, something that may have been missing in their last trip to T-Town. Said offensive lineman Kyler Kerbyson-\"When we went down two years ago, it was almost like survive. Now it's different. We've turned this around. We believe in ourselves, and we believe in each other.\" While it might be hard for Tennessee's running game to be successful against Alabama's run-stopping defense, Coach Jones says it still needs to be effective. \"If Alabama makes you one dimensional, you're in for a long day. We have to be able to have a balanced attack.\" Even though Tennessee has lost eight straight in the series, it remains a huge, huge rivalry. Kerbyson-\"Everyone talks about the Florida rivalry or Vandy rivalry. There's just a little bit different feeling with Alabama.\" Said Jones-\"All we're interested in are one-game winning streaks. You win won and move on to the next and then you move on to the next. We talk about each game is a new season in and of itself.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:44:03.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
