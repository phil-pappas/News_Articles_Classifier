GCC challenges players in a game where rules and targets allow for two different handicaps to compete against each other. Easy to set up and play anywhere, Golfchipchallenge is perfect for the backyard, camping trips or the park.\nGolfchipchallenge focuses on the \"play to learn\" philosophy that allows players to refine their skills through practice. It helps golfers improve their short games while having fun. Renè Wiesel is a 25-year teaching professional who has used many products that promise to enhance a player's golf game, but notes that many of these products do not deliver on that promise. According to Wiesel, \"In order for a golf training product to work, you have to actually include a real golf club and real golf balls as well as a realistic surface to practice on, like grass. Anything else really has not got anything to do with golf at all.\"\n\"Secondly, I believe that the reason no current training aid has had success, is because it has no consequence to miss a shot, you just take another ball from the bucket and do it again till you get it right. That type of practicing is simply inefficient and has absolutely no resemblance to the actual game at all,\" adds Wiesel. GCC enables two golfers of different level of skills to compete against each other, but also forces the players to take every shot seriously.\nAs seen at https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/golfchipchallenge/soon-this-kid-is-chipping-like-a-pga-pro , the Kickstarter campaign offers pledge levels from kr33 to kr50,000 and rewards from access to the professional app as well as Golfchipchallenge games.
