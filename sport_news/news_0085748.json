They agreed Noah would play only at cornerback.\nDuring one blowout, Johnston pulled his starters and played his second- and third-team offense and put Giles in at running back. Whether it was fear, talent or a little bit of both, Giles made the most of his first varsity carry.\n\"We were at our own 30 and he turns the corner and accelerates up and flies down the sideline for a touchdown,\" Johnston said.\nGiles' run got the fans excited, including one fan who cheered the entire way to the end zone.\n\"On the film, there's a man sprinting down the track just as fast as Noah,\" Johnston said, trying to keep from laughing. \"It was his dad. He was so excited that he literally chased him all the way down the track.\"\nAnthony Giles admitted he was guilty.\n\"I was cheering him along the way and they caught it on videotape,\" said Giles, a former high school running back. \"It was something you would see on America's Most Funniest Videos or something.\"\nBut it was after that run that he and his wife knew Johnston was right.\n\"After that very same play,\" Anthony said, \"Coach Johnston turned and looked to me and said basically, 'I told you so.' \"\nAnthony has stopped running, but his son hasn't. Noah has rushed for 1,321 yards and 17 touchdowns to lead the Saints to sole possession of first place in the Tidewater Conference this season.\nGiles, averaging 9.6 yards per carry, is on pace to eclipse the Nansemond-Suffolk single-season record of 1,775 yards by Danny Holly in 1980.\n\"We certainly will give him the opportunity to break it,\" Johnston said.\nAsked about the record, the mild-mannered senior shrugged his shoulders.\n\"I'm not really trying to shoot for it,\" Giles said. \"I'm just trying to do my best each game.\"\nGiles' motivation to play hard comes from watching his teammates' reaction to a 40-24 loss to St. Anne's-Belfield in the VISAA Division II semifinals last season.\n\"I remember seeing the seniors walk off that field in tears... I just don't want to have that same feeling,\" he said. \"I also know that I have an opportunity to play football in college, but most of my teammates don't. So I want to do it for them, too.\"\nGiles, ranked the No. 36 prospect in South Hampton Roads, has offers from William & Mary, Richmond, Air Force and Navy. At 5-foot-11 and 185 pounds, he is polite and reserved.\n\"It's classic Superman and Clark Kent,\" Johnston said. \"Because when he puts his football uniform on, he's a different person.\"\nLike Superman, Giles has great speed - last spring he won the VISAA Division II 100-meter title - has great vision and the ability to change directions on a dime.\n\"There's no doubt in my mind he can play\" major college football, Johnston said. \"They know what he can do. I talked with a bunch of coaches and they say he compares to any back in the state.\"\nTeammate Daniel Griffith, who played three seasons at Western Branch before transferring to Nansemond-Suffolk, agreed.\n\"I think he could hang with anybody in the Southeastern District,\" Griffith said. \"No matter what level of football you're playing at, your talent will shine. He's just one of those guys who keeps pressing on and runs hard. He just wants to keep playing and leading his team.\"\nLarry Rubama, 757-446-2273,larry.rubama@pilotonline.com,Twitter: @LHRubama\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image.
