They have to know when to turn it off. You can't hit after the whistle blows. Stuff like that can come back to haunt you if it's a real close game.\" \nThe Panthers were able to overcome the mistakes and clinched a No. 1 seed and a first-round bye as the Class 7A's top team in the 7A/6A-Central Conference after their 3-0 record against 7A opponents Central, North Little Rock and West Memphis this season. \n\"It helps,\" Malham said. \"At the end of the year, you can rest. I'm telling you, some people will say you can get stale. But I don't think one week off, they're going to forget what they're supposed to do. \n\"That week is good for you. Then you get to play at home, so whoever you have to play has to come here, so that's good.\" \nCabot has three regular-season games left and can clinch at least a share of the overall 7A/6A-Central title with victories in two of its final three regular-season games against Mountain Home on Friday, at Jonesboro on Oct. 30 and at Searcy on Nov. 5. \nJunior quarterback Jarrod Barnes rushed for 93 yards and 2 touchdowns on 8 carries for Cabot. \nAfter a scoreless first quarter, Cabot drove 84 yards in 13 plays and Kolton Eads capped the drive with a 3-yard touchdown run to give the Panthers a 7-0 lead with 7:39 left in the second quarter. \nConnor Daigle blocked a Michael Lieterman punt and Cabot took advantage, as Barnes scored from 6 yards out to make it 14-0 with 1:51 left in the half. The touchdown was set up by Barnes' 16-yard pass to John Wiens. Barnes finished 3-of-5 passing for 18 yards. \nRoberts' 1-yard touchdown run, which was set up by Braxton Burton's 44-yard run, extended the Panthers' lead to 21-0 with 9:38 left in the third quarter. Barnes added a 14-yard run with 3:11 left in the quarter for a 28-0 lead. \nSenior running back Richard Hayes scored the Tigers' only touchdown, a 3-yard run, that pulled Central within 28-7 with 11:17 left. Cabot stretched its lead to 42-7 on Austin Morse's 13-yard run and Roberts' 1-yard run. \nHayes, who had 802 rushing yards entering Friday's game, was held to 67 yards on 13 carries Friday. \n\"We didn't get any movement up front with our offensive line,\" Central Coach Ellis \"Scooter\" Register said. \"They had a good scheme trying to keep him intact. They had a great game plan. We weren't able to execute. \n\"They got a really good football team. Mike has done a great job with them.\" \nNO. 2 PINE BLUFF 35, LR HALL 0 \nPINE BLUFF — Pine Bluff’s Keshawn Whaley scored three touchdowns as Pine Bluff (7-0, 4-0 6A-South) defeated Little Rock Hall (0-7, 0-4). Quarterback Casey Higgins Jr. put the Zebras on the board first with a touchdown pass to Xavier Smith. Whaley scored on the next drive on a 16-yard run and Higgins closed out the Zebras’ scoring in the first quarter with a 13-yard touchdown run. Whaley added touchdown runs in the second and third quarters, and Justin Williams made all five extra-point attemots \nSports on 10/17/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:08:07.955+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
