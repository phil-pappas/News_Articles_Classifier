We just have to figure out where to plug them in. We don't have to teach them how to play.\" \nSophomore Shelby Worsham won her second consecutive girls singles title with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Haas Hall sophomore Venesa Salinas. \nJanes took 20 minutes to complete his 6-0 first-set victory, an easy romp that inspired Hargrave to tailor a new attack. \n\"In the second set I had a little more drive,\" Hargrave said. \"I felt a little more desperate, so I started hitting my serves harder and I tried to play to his backhand, because his forehand is just so very good.\" \nHargrave won the second serve of the second set to tie at 2-2. \n\"I was very concerned,\" Janes said. \"At 2-2, it could've gone either way. He's a really good player, but I really didn't see that coming. The second set was a lot harder for me than the first. He was playing a lot harder with more motivation to win.\" \nThe fifth game was tied at 30 when Hargrave left the baseline in a dash to the net. He hoped to cut the angle on the shot he expected from Janes, a hard, relatively risk-free return. Instead, Janes hit a high lob. \nHargrave quickly reversed course toward the baseline, but Janes' shot was too deep. It bounced 6 inches in, and Hargrave could manage no more than a shot that shanked out of bounds, 15 feet short of the net. \n\"That lob came out of the blue,\" Hargrave said. \"It was just a really good shot selection, and like all of his shots it was just very well executed.\" \n\" I just thought at that moment I should hit a lob, and it was my best shot,\" Janes said. \"It was at a good point in the match when it was really close.\" \nHargrave said he thought Janes' forehand was unbeatable. \n\"I've never played anyone with a forehand like that,\" he said. \"It has to be one of the best in Arkansas.\" \nSports on 10/21/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:19:05.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
