Lauren Fie -- Corning’s lone senior -- led the way on senior night with seven kills and two blocks. Teammate Sophia Sariegeo had a big match as well, adding seven kills and one block for the Hawks, who improved to 8-4. Ashlyn Amsden dished out 12 setter assists for the Hawks and Corning’s Hayley Gorges finished with six digs. “I was a little worried after the slow start in the first game, but the kids kept their composure and played aggressive,” Corning head coach Irene Furness said. “They played very smart tonight. Everything doesn’t have to be all power and they showed that tonight.” Maine-Endwell fell to 8-4 overall and 7-4 in the STAC after the loss. Corning will next play at the Horseheads Classic, which begins at 8:30 a.m. Saturday.
