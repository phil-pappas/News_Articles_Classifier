They lost to the San Diego State Aztecs 48-14. Playing the Aztecs was much harder this week and it was due to the Aggies’ four turnovers which the Aztecs converted into points, their rush defense that is usually so strong was not there, and because of the quarterback Myers who made some poor choices throughout the game.\nMyers could not get the offense going in the game and needed help from his wide receivers and running backs to bail him out. He caused three of the four turnovers for the Aggies off of one interception and two fumbles.\nUtah State’s defense that was so praised and feared last week was brought to its knees by the Aztec running backs Donnel Pumphrey and Chase Price, who had more than a combined 250 yards rushing. The Aggies rush defense was ranked 6th in FBS but was demolished by Pumphrey and Price. It was a rough game on both sides of the field for the Aggies.\nThis is the report card for the Utah State Aggies vs San Diego State Aztecs football game.\nQuarterback\nSophomore quarterback Kent Myers had a sloppy game with three turnovers and was ineffective against the Aztecs’ defense. He tried to run the ball but was held to 28 yards. Myers had little effect through the air, although one of the Aggies two touchdowns did come from a long pass from Myers to Hunter Sharp. Myers had only 93 yards passing and one interception, which the Aztecs converted into points. Myers also fumbled the ball twice early in the game, giving the Aztecs a huge lead which Utah State could not come back from. Not all the blame can fall on Myers though. Grade: C-\nRunning Backs\nWorking with what they were given, Utah State running backs Devante Mays and LaJuan Hunt had a decent game. They were given the ball frequently throughout the night but were shut down by the Aztecs’ front seven and defensive secondary. On the night, Mays had 12 carries for 67 yards and Hunt had six carries for 17 yards, with Mays rushing for a 26-yard touchdown. It was a tough night to be a running back, but when they were given the ball the two main running backs for the Aggies did an OK job. Grade: B+\nWide receivers\nSimilar to the running backs, the wide receivers for Utah State had to work with what they were given. Hunter Sharp again led the team in receiving yards. This week he had four receptions for 63 yards along with Hunt and four other players who only had one reception, the biggest being 11 yards. Hunter Sharp was the second other player with a touchdown on a deep pass by Myers. It was a slow and quiet night for the wide receivers, but when they did receive the ball, they made the most of it. Grade: B\nOffensive line\nThe offensive line was pushed back tonight - literally. The Aztecs did not have to bring pressure from the secondary to push the line back and put Myers in stressful situations. The Aggies’ offensive line was weak, unlike how it usually is. It lost the battle of toughness against the Aztecs and caused one sack, three fumbles and an interception. Early in the game it was established that the Aztecs were a very physical team, and the Aggies could not cope with San Diego State’s tough line. Grade: C\nFront seven\nThis will be a game to forget for the defensive line. Much like the offensive line, the defensive line was pushed back. The Aggies’ front line did not have an answer for stopping Pumphrey and Price. Whenever either of these running backs touched the ball they were behind a huge offensive line man who the Aggies could not handle. The defense gave up 336 total rushing yards on 61 carries. The Aztecs completed 19 first downs with 12 of them coming by running the ball. It was a very different defense than the one we saw last week against Boise State, and the Aggies have a lot of things to fix before next week’s game.
