(AP) â€” A TV station in western Michigan is apologizing after a reporter who didn't see the crazy, final play told viewers that Michigan had defeated Michigan State.\nJamal Spencer of WZZM-TV was reporting live Saturday from outside Michigan Stadium. He said Michigan was \"able to run out the clock.\"\nSpencer said, \"People are spilling out of Michigan Stadium into the streets of Ann Arbor celebrating.\" Back at the Grand Rapids studio, colleague Eric Lloyd quickly told the audience that the Spartans had won the game by returning a fumble for a touchdown on the final play.\nNews director Taz Painter says \"we screwed up\" but notes the mistake was immediately corrected.\nSpencer acknowledged the mistake on Twitter, saying: \"Gotta take the bad with the good.\"\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
