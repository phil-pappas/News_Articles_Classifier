Ryan said Friday that Taylor is \"feeling a lot better\" but would be a game-time decision.\nManuel was Buffalo's first-round draft pick in 2013 but has not played this year after losing the starting job to Taylor during the preseason. The 25-year-old Manuel appeared in five games last season, completing 58 percent of his passes for 838 yards, five touchdowns and three interceptions.\nTaylor, 26, has sparked the Bills to a 3-2 record in his first season as a starting quarterback. He suffered a sprained MCL in last week's victory over the Tennessee Titans and has been limited at practice this week.\n0 Shares Email Star Comments Sources: EJ Manuel expected to start Sunday against Bengals \"\nOregon Gunman Acted 'Like He Was Playing a Video Game' \"\nIn Clinton vs. Carson, Experience 'Overrated,' Kristol Says \"\nHow Identical Twin Boys Became Brother and Sister \"\nCops Release Sketches in Train Attack Hero Stabbing \"\nMaryland Man Arrested in Murder of Transgender Woman \"\nMore Than 2 Inches of Snow Falls in Northern Michigan \"\nChess Teacher Who Fought off Attacker Says Class Is Still On \"\nNYC Trial Revisits Infamous Heist Portrayed in 'Goodfellas' \"\nSouthern California Recovers From Mud Mess Left By Storms Police Arrest 2nd Suspect in Beating of Daycare Owner Suspect Wounded in Shootout With Police at Shopping Center \"\nHow Hillary Clinton Got Her Groove Back In Alabama, Clinton Goes After Republicans on Voting Rights \"\nMexican Drug Lord Flown to Sinaloa Mountains After Escape Israel: 4 Palestinian Attackers Shot Dead in Latest Violence \"\nDOT Planning to Require Drones to Be Registered Iran FM Wants 'Humanitarian' Solution for US Reporter Senior Al-Qaida Commander Killed in an Airstrike in Syria Ex-Members of Church Where Teens Beaten Talk of Decline Ex-Uber Driver Pleads Guilty to Boston Rape, Gets Prison \"\n'Electrical Smell' Forces Southwest Airlines Flight to Divert 60 Cats Taken From Home Where Owner Was Trying to Run Rescue \"\nAngelina Jolie Reveals Secrets of Her Family's Home Life \"\nMan Recalls Surviving Alligator Attack \"\nThe Dangers of Train Track Photography \"\nLamar Odom Opens His Eyes Days After Being Hospitalized \"\n'Crimson Peak' Movie Review: Expect a Lot of Twisted Nonsense", "external_links": ["http://a.abcnews.com/assets/beta/js/custom/pages/trident_story.js?v=50", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fabcnews.go.com%2FSports%2Fsources-ej-manuel-expected-start-sunday-bengals%2Fstory%3Fid%3D34545415", "http://a.abcnews.com/assets/beta/js/abcn.js?v=50", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/js/merlin-ext.js?v=2", "http://media.video-cdn.espn.com/motion/2015/1017/dm_151017_ncf_martysmith_Feature/dm_151017_ncf_martysmith_Feature_default.jpg", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Sources%3A+EJ+Manuel+expected+to+start+Sunday+against+Bengals+-+ABC+News+-+http%3A%2F%2Fabcn.ws%2F1GM9JgC&via=ABC", "http://abcnewsplayer-a.akamaihd.net/player/2.24.0.0000/amp.premier/amp.premier.min.js?v=2", "http://media.video-cdn.espn.com/motion/2015/1017/dm_151017_dinich_week_7_picks/dm_151017_dinich_week_7_picks_default.jpg", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/email/offer?url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/sources-ej-manuel-expected-start-sunday-bengals/story?id=34545415&title=Sources%3A+EJ+Manuel+expected+to+start+Sunday+against+Bengals", "http://a.abcnews.com/assets/js/s_code_15.js?v=4", "http://media.video-cdn.espn.com/motion/2015/1017/dm_151017_ncf_boisestate_utahstate342/dm_151017_ncf_boisestate_utahstate342_default.jpg", "http://media.video-cdn.espn.com/motion/2015/1017/dm_151017_ncf_spurrier_essay/dm_151017_ncf_spurrier_essay_default.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/js/merlin-core.js?v=2"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:01:41.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
