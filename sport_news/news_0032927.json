With the Lynx facing the Indiana Fever in the deciding Game 5 of the finals, the chance to see something special brought out the largest crowd the Lynx have ever had — 18,933, about 400 short of a sellout.\nThe towel-waving cacophony appeared to energize the Lynx, who dominated the second half with suffocating defense to win, 69-52, for their third championship in five years. Not since the Houston Comets won the first four W.N.B.A. titles from 1997 to 2000 has a team had such a prolonged stretch of success in the league. Center Sylvia Fowles, acquired from Chicago in midseason, spurred the Lynx with 20 points and 11 rebounds and was named the finals’ most valuable player.\nAt the buzzer, Fowles joined the Lynx veterans Lindsay Whalen, Rebekkah Brunson, Maya Moore and Seimone Augustus in a group hug under the Indiana basket as confetti tumbled gently from the arena’s ceiling. Indiana held the dynamic Moore to 5 points, but Fowles, Augustus (16 points) and Brunson (14 rebounds, 10 points) provided more than enough. Tamika Catchings led Indiana with 18 points and 11 rebounds.\nWhile the first four games were decided by 6 points or less, the Lynx — known for their defense and rebounding under Coach Cheryl Reeve — wrapped this one up by the opening minute of the fourth quarter. Minnesota limited Indiana to 4 points in the second quarter, a record low for a W.N.B.A. finals game, and 8 in the third in bursting to a 48-29 lead. In that stretch the Lynx forced 17 turnovers and held the Fever to 4-for-24 shooting from the field (.167).\n“Everybody is done making adjustments and watching video, so it comes down to your team’s identity,” said Reeve, a veteran of two Game 5s in the finals as a Detroit Shock assistant in 2006 and ’07. “If you weren’t a very good offensive team through most of the season, you’re probably not going to be good offensively in a Game 5. That goes with everything — free throws, rebounds. Your identity is shown in a Game 5.”\nIndiana had won five consecutive elimination games but could not muster enough offense Wednesday night.\nThe Fever were trying to win a second championship for the veteran Catchings, 36, their emotional leader, who plans to retire after next year’s Olympics. “To be able to go to the finals three times in my career, it’s truly a blessing,” Catchings said before Indiana’s practice on Tuesday.\nCatchings, the league’s most valuable player in 2011, won the finals M.V.P. in 2012 when the Fever beat the Lynx in four games.\n“She’s someone who has been so good for so long that you can hardly imagine what it would look like without her being one of the leaders of the W.N.B.A.,” Moore said. “She’s just been a relentless competitor for her whole career and really set the bar high. She’s definitely somebody who cares about the impact she’s leaving on people, on and off the court.”\nIndiana took a stressful path to the final, losing the opening game of its first two series, then winning decisive Game 3s on the road. The Fever surprised the Lynx in Game 1 here on Oct. 4, but the Lynx won the next two, taking Game 3 at the buzzer on Moore’s dramatic top-of-the-key 3-pointer. On Sunday, the Fever won their fifth consecutive elimination game this postseason, 75-69, setting up the deciding game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:45:09.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
