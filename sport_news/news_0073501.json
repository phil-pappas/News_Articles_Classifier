We were pretty fortunate.” \nNikki Taylor, UH’s leader in kills, aces and points, missed the match against the Anteaters, but Manu-Olevao filled her shoes nicely, swatting 15 kills with 11 digs and a career-high seven blocks for her second double-double of the season. \nThe Rainbow Wahine (18-1, 8-0 Big West) also were without the services of outside hitter Kalei Greeley, who missed her second consecutive match. Starting setter Tayler Higgins entered the match in the second set, her first action since Oct. 2. \nManu-Olevao, a 6-foot senior, was born in Hilo and attended Waiakea Intermediate before moving to Oahu while in the eighth-grade. She played her high school volleyball at Punahou on Oahu, winning an HHSAA championship her senior season. Her mother, Charlene Kela Olevao, lives in Hilo and is the cousin of major leaguer Keone Kela of the Texas Rangers. \nShe became a starter as a sophomore with the Wahine, finishing third in kills, and she led the way as a junior. This season, Manu-Olevao is second on the team with 176 kills, and third in points (kills/blocks/aces), averaging 3.28 per set. \nOn Friday, Manu-Olevao was efficient with 12 kills on .375 hitting hitting in a four-set victory against UC Davis. \nFirst in the Big West, Hawaii is off until it plays its final two home matches, Oct. 30 against UC Riverside and Nov. 1 against Cal State Fullerton. \n“We’re going to practice, mostly skills and one time we’ll do some team stuff,” Shoji said. “We’ll get a chance to heal up some injuries for sure.” Rules for posting comments \nComments posted below are from readers.
