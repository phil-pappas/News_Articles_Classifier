He was suspended three times with the Flyers, totaling 14 games.\nThe NHL's department of player safety, in a video it released Thursday, acknowledged Couturier's head was struck, \"but it was not the main point of contact\" and it said Rinaldo did not launch into the center.\nRinaldo was given a five-minute charging penalty and a game misconduct. The puck was not in the area when Rinaldo charged into Couturier by the boards, and his head snapped back from the impact and he fell to the ice.\n\"There's no place for it,\" Flyers coach Dave Hakstol said of Rinaldo's hit.\nRinaldo said he that had his \"emotions going\" in the game and that he thought he delivered a clean check. \"It's unfortunate he's hurt. That's the last thing I want to do ... Especially someone that I know personally.\"\nA few Flyers said it was a good thing Rinaldo was ejected because otherwise they may have been preoccupied trying to pay him back instead of playing their game.\nAs for Schenn, he was injured on a neutral-zone collision with Dallas' Antoine Roussel on Tuesday, and he sat out the stirring 5-4 comeback win over Boston in overtime one night later.\nIf Schenn and Couturier can't play Saturday, Vinny Lecavalier (remember him?) figures to make his first appearance of the season.\nBackup goalie Michal Neuvirth was also injured against Boston and was removed after the first period. While Patrice Bergeron scored a goal, his stick inadvertently hit Neuvirth in the mask. Neuvirth is also listed as day-to-day.\nIt was 2-2 at the time of Rinaldo's hit, just before the first period ended. Boston later built a 4-2 lead before third-period goals by Claude Giroux and Wayne Simmonds tied it.\nGiroux won it with 2:51 left in overtime, firing a one-timer from the left circle past Tuukka Rask while the Flyers were on a four-on-three power play. It was Giroux's sixth career OT goal, tying him with Simon Gagne for the most in franchise history, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.\nIn the first period, Giroux made two mistakes (an errant pass and a four-minute high-sticking penalty) that led to Boston's first two goals, but he redeemed himself late in the game.\nGiroux finished with two goals, five shots, four hits, and wins in 14 of 23 faceoffs (61 percent). He was an impressive 10 for 19 (53 percent) against Bergeron, who has won 58.4 percent of his career faceoffs.\nThe Flyers outhit the Bruins, 38-28. Michael Raffl had seven of the hits.\n\"We played a light game,\" Boston coach Claude Julien said. \"A lot lighter than them. They certainly were better in the battles than we were. ... We had too many guys with light sticks.\"\n(c)2015 The Philadelphia Inquirer\nVisit The Philadelphia Inquirer at www.philly.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1742066&h=Rinaldo+avoids+suspension+for+hit+on+Couturier", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1742066&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1742066"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:12:13.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
