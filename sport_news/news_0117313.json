Downey scored her team's only goal in a 1-1 overtime tie. \nThe Lancers, with the more impressive record and resume, played to win on the Highlanders' home turf. West Milford, which has struggled to score goals this season, played not to lose. \nAt the end of 100 intense minutes that included dozens of foul calls and a blizzard of yellow cards, the two teams ended the contest in a 1-1 tie. \nHighlander coach Roberto Zuban, however, was smiling when the dust settled. \n\"I'm smiling because when I came to West Milford this year, I said the only thing I want to accomplish is when these girls take the field everybody who comes here has to sweat to beat us,\" said Zuban. \nIt took the Lancers' high-powered offense plenty of sweat and nearly 75 minutes or regulation time to tie the game. \nLancer Danielle Downey averted what would have been a major upset when she found herself unmarked about seven yards out. She headed the ball neatly past Highlander goalie Olivia DellColliano who had an outstanding game, stopping 10 Lancer shots, several of those from point blank range. \nDellColliano was kept busy all evening, facing 25 Lakeland shots, a testament to the Lancer's relentless end-to-end offense. \nZuban's Highlanders took the lead 25 minutes into the game on Rebecca Jurkovic's high shot from about 20-yards out from a tough angle. The ball settled into the net just under the crossbar eluding Lancer goalie Jenna Bracken who made seven saves in the game. \nHighlander Taylor Bishop was credited with the assist. \nFrom that point what had been a back and forth, attack and counter attack contest, got extremely physical \nAccording to West Milford's score sheet, over 30 fouls were called, 18 against Lakeland. \nSix yellow cards were also handed out. \nDespite Lakeland's considerable offensive edge, the Lancers were unable to put the clincher past DellColliano and the Highlander defense. \n\"I'm proud of these girls,\" said Zuban. \"We have heart. We have the biggest heart in Passaic County and everyone should take notice of that.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:47:11.184+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
