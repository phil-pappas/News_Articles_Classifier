(AP) â€” \nSebastien Le Toux converted a penalty kick in the 41st minute and Andre Blake earned the shutout in the Philadelphia Union's 1-0 victory on Sunday that knocked Orlando City out of MLS Cup playoff contention. Orlando City had faint playoff hopes going into the season finale, needing a victory and a New England Revolution loss while making up an eight-goal differential. New England beat NYC FC 3-1. With Le Toux improving to 13 for 13 on penalty kicks, the Union (10-17-7) snapped a two-game losing streak, but missed the playoffs for the fourth straight season. Cristian Higuita collected a pair of second-half yellow cards and was ejected in the 86th minute. The teams were booked for 10 cards in the game, seven by Orlando City . Blake, the first pick in the 2014 SuperDraft, needed five saves to collect the shutout.
