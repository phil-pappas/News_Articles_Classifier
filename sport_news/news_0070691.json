After that, the Warriors seemed to direct much of their fire at their own feet as the Green Knights ripped off five unanswered touchdowns helped by Wilson mistakes. \nAfter Logan Sterner’s 73-yard scoring run made it 43-13 late in the third quarter, the game was more or less over. \n“Once again we don’t come out and play in the second half,” Senneca said. “We came out flat and it just steamrolled from there.” \nThough Wilson didn’t go quietly; that 93-yard TD, a play on which Goodman was all by himself, couldn’t have been executed better and was worthy of a highlight film. \nUnfortunately, much of the other Warrior play was not. \n“We just keep constantly hurting ourselves,” said a furious Senneca afterwards. “Penalties, missed assignments, turnovers, mental mistakes, missed tackles. Pen Argyl didn’t do anything that we hadn’t seen on the film. But you can’t do what we did today and win games.” \nPerhaps the single most infuriating aspect of the game to Senneca came from penalties. Wilson was flagged six times for holding, several of which flags wiped out nice gains, and committed two mindless and costly personal fouls. \n“We had over 100 yards in penalties,” Senneca said. “We just keep killing ourselves.” \nNot a day to discuss records with Matt Senneca – not at all. \nBrad Wilson may be reached at bwilson@lehighvalleylive.com .
