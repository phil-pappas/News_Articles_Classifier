Bargnani has missed 175 of a possible 312 regular season games in the past four years.\nThen there are his comments regarding this particular injury.\nBack on Oct. 5, Bargnani said \"I'm good, I'll be back very soon.\" Half a month later, the injury lingers.\nOn Oct. 13, Bargnani was not on the injury report and the team said he went through a full practice. But he was ruled out for the Oct 14. preseason game. \nOn Oct. 16, he went through partial practice. But on Oct. 17, he didn't practice. And he didn't play in the Nets' final two preseason games Oct. 19 and 20.\nBargnani downplayed the apparent setback of going from full practice to no practice. He said he hasn't gone full bore since the injury.\n\"I was never fully, like, 100 percent complete,\" Bargnani said. \"It wasn't full, it was kind of half-practice.\"\nWednesday he said he's improving and it was nice to get back on the court.\n\"I felt good ... running up and down,\" Bargnani said. \"I didn't do everything in practice, but we keep building every day so I feel good about it. … Always increasing so I can do more and I can do the whole practice 100 percent, so I can do every exercise inside the practice.\"\nMeanwhile, Brown, who injured his oblique during training camp, was back on the practice court.\n\"It is nice to finally get out there on the court, move around, get into the plays a little bit,\" Brown said. \n\"Just watching on the sidelines, it looks like you got it, but actually being out there on the court you've got to react a different way.\"\nBrown, a backup shooting guard, said he's hoping to get back to practicing 100 percent in the next few days, which would put him on track for the season opener.\nEmail: vasqueza@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:00:53.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
