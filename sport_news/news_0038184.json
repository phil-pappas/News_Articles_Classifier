Image 18 of 18 Greg Hardy rap video featuring strippers, guns surfaces 1 / 18 Back to Gallery Friday night, TMZ Sports posted a link to a music video of Greg Hardy that's discreetly been up on YouTube for just over a month.\nIn the video, titled \"I'm Just Me,' Hardy lashes out against his \"haters\" with collaborator Jā Alan, who confirmed to TMZ that the video was made in late 2014 — after Hardy was found guilty of two counts of domestic violence.\nThe video features the two men surrounded by luxury cars and a mountain of luminous rims, strippers with $100 bills draped from their g-strings, and cheesy, fog-infused lighting. The track is interspersed with sounds of sirens and gunfire, which provides a macabre ambiance of sorts.\n\"It'll be a cold day in hell before your girl tries to play me,\" Hardy raps. \"What you see is what you get. I'm just me, I'm just real, and that's what I do.\"\nYeah, we've seen what you do.\nWe've seen what the 6-foot-5, 280-pound man who was accused of throwing a woman onto a couch with guns for cushions can do.\nWe've seen what the man who was accused of placing his hands — the hands he uses to do battle with 300-plus-pound offensive lineman — on a woman's throat and squeezing the life away, can do.\n\"He looked me in my eyes and he told me he was going to kill me,\" said his accuser during last year's trial. \"I was so scared I wanted to die. When he loosened his grip slightly, I said just, 'Do it. Kill me.\"\nThis is a man who recently told reporters he planned to come out \"guns blazing\" against the Patriots, who in that same interview made lascivious comments towards Tom Brady's wife, Gisele Bündchen.\nThis is a man who shouldn't be playing football — not for America's Team, not for any team — but there he'll be on Sunday, lined up across from Brady, doing all he can to get his hands on him.\nClick here to see the music video.\nnmoyle@express-news.net\nTwitter: @NRmoyle", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/06/60/64/1772821/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/11220817/greg-hardy-carolina-panthers-guilty-2-counts-domestic-violence", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/15/64/47/3623384/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/24/10/8471060/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/15/64/47/3623384/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/47/51/8288884/19/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/47/36/8550306/3/920x920.jpg", "https://twitter.com/NRMoyle", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/10/8770049/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/47/36/8550306/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/47/51/8288884/19/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/24/10/8471061/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/47/36/8550304/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/40/24/10/8471061/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/77/43/7862500/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/35/22/20/7676991/15/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/77/43/7862500/9/920x920.jpg", "http://www.tmz.com/2015/10/10/greg-hardy-money-strippers-and-bottles-in-music-video-shot-during-suspension/", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/47/36/8550304/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5iuEBqDZbI", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/10/8770052/4/920x920.png", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/10/8770052/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/20/45/7670094/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/10/8770051/4/920x920.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/10/8770051/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/47/51/8288887/13/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/10/8770049/4/920x920.png", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/06/60/64/1772821/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/37/47/51/8288885/13/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/47/51/8288887/13/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/35/20/45/7670095/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/40/24/10/8471060/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/20/45/7670096/13/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/35/20/45/7670095/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/35/22/20/7676991/15/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/37/47/51/8288885/13/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/35/20/45/7670096/13/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/20/45/7670094/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T00:23:06.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
