(Richard Skinner) -- Welcome to the Bengals Fifth Quarter where I provide my analysis of Sunday's 34-21 overtime win over the Buffalo Bills that came before a crowd of 69,593 in Ralph Wilson Stadium (here is a link to the story I filed at the final gun ): \nGAME BALLS \nOffense: Andy Dalton and Marvin Jones. \nThe Skinny: Dalton completed 22 of 33 passes for 243 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions, while Jones had a career-high nine receptions for 95 yards and a touchdown. \nDalton had a passer rating of 118.6, which marked the fifth time this season he had a rating of 115.9 or higher. \nDalton spread the ball around to seven different receivers, and was 14 of 19 for 165 yards in the second half. \n\"We're trying to put pressure on the defense by making them defend the whole field,\" said Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis. \"With more coverage on A.J. (Green) we know we're getting one-on-one looks at other spots. The quarterback has been doing a good job of orchestrating where the ball should go to what we perceive as a weakness in the opposing defense.\" \nDalton said he simply takes advantage of what the defensive looks give him. \n\"It just gees to show the talent we have on this team; the ability to get a bunch of different guys involved,\" said Dalton. \"When you can do that it puts the defense on their heels. They're not sure exactly what they should do. You never know who is going to have a big week.\" \nThis game it was Jones, who has terrorized Rex Ryan defense. When Ryan was head coach of the New York Jets in 2013, Jones had eight receptions for a career-high 122 yards and a franchise record four touchdowns. \n\"We come with great plans and we adjust to what they do and however they play us so it's tough,\" said Jones. \"It's great to be in this offense where you can't just heck one person. We have depth at every position and everybody can take it the distance; everybody can do great things.\" \nRyan, who usually likes to blitz, chose to play mostly Cover 2 with two deep safeties, and rush four and sometimes only three in attempt to take both Green and tight end Tyler Eifert out of the mix. \n\"When we get into a week it's kind of like, 'How are they going to try to take away A.J.?' \" said Dalton. \"They played two-high coverage and cheated to him and didn't let him do it, but that leaves the other guys one-on-one.\" \nGreen, who had four receptions for 36 yards, said he's fine with the attention and was happy for Jones. \n\"(Rex) didn't have an answer for him,\" said Green. \"(Marvin) plays his butt off. He had a great game again today. They try to take me away or take Eifert away and we see what Marvin can do and what Mo (Mohamed Sanu, who had two catches for 30 yards can do and week to week you can have any of us making big plays.\" \nDefense: Darqueze Dennard. \nThe Skinny: The second-year cornerback, who was the team's 2014 first-round draft pick, stepped in for injured Leon Hall as he nickel back and recorded his first career interception late in the first quarter. \nOn the play Bills quarterback E.J. Manuel tried to hit wide receiver Chris Hogan deep up the right sideline against man-to-man coverage, but Dennard blanketed Hogan, the ball was underthrown and Dennard came up with the interception. \nIt helped him atone for allowing a big pass play each of the last two weeks. \n\"The last couple of weeks I've been in good coverage and they threw over top of me and made the play,\" said Dennard. \"This time he threw it and I had my eyes back early so I can make the play on the ball and I did.\" \nDennard said the ball will wind up in his grandmother's trophy case. \nWhile he has been behind Hall, Adam Jones and Dre Kirkpatrick, Dennard said he has continued to prepare himself to play each game as if he is the starter, and credited veterans Hall and Jones for helping with that. \n\"They always push you,\" said Dennard. \"Throughout the week, Leon and Adam do a great job of motivating me; telling me to stay ready when your number is called. They're always in my ear. They always try to stay hard on me, because I think they know what type of player I can be. They're always motivating me since I got here. \nCOACHING GRADE \nThe Skinny: Based on adjustments and success it's an A-minus, although the Bengals were actually outgained in the game 368-355. \nIt was a sluggish start as the Bengals allowed an 11-play, 80-yard touchdown drive by the Bills to start the game, then went three-and-out on their first possession, which suggested a team that was flat. \nInstead, the Bengals defense forced four straight three-and-outs after that, one of which ended with Dennard's interception, and scored the next 17 points in the first half. \n\"We still ended up being our own worst enemy at times,\" said Lewis. \"We've got a lot of coaching to do. I guess that's a positive.\" \nTHREE THINGS I LIKED \n-- The offensive start to the second half. \nThe Skinny: The Bengals scored 17 points on their first three possessions of the second half to put the game away. They drove 90 yards in eight plays to start the half after Buffalo had seemingly gained some momentum with a 14-play, 86-yard drive that took up almost the final seven minutes of the first half. \n\"It put back the seven points after they got seven points at the end of the second (quarter), so we kind of answered them right out of the locker room,\" said Lewis. \n\"That was really big,\" said Dalton. \"You know you want to come out and you want to play fast and you want to score quickly, especially since they scored right before halftime. You wanted to respond a that point and we did.\" \nThe Bengals upped the tempo a bit on that drive. \n\"We feel like we can play a little quicker than we were and it worked well for us,\" said Dalton. \"We got momentum and we just kind of kept rolling.\" \nDalton completed 5 of 6 passes for 82 yards on the drive with Jones catching four passes for 66 yards, including a 10-yard touchdown reception. \nJones hauled in a 42-yard pass over his shoulder deep down the middle between two defenders on the drive. \n\"I said, 'Hey, I'm taking off, that's what I told him,' \" said Jones. \"He threw it out there and whenever the ball is in the air our mentality in our room is hey we're going to go get it. I saw it was travelling outside of me and went and got it. I knew they were around me. Once the ball is in the air, I don't worry about that. I just worry about tracking the ball.\" \nOn the touchdown reception, Jones was up-ended and did a cartwheel the final two yards into the end zone. \n\"After I caught it I made a move and then I said, no I just got to go for it. I have to score this,\" said Jones. \nThe Bengals followed that drive by marching 78 yards in 12 plays for a touchdown the next time they had the ball. On that drive, Dalton completed passes to three different receivers, including tight end Tyler Eifert for a four-yard touchdown, and Hill and Giovani Bernard combined for 31 yards rushing on six carries. \n-- The way the offensive line protected Dalton. \nThe Skinny: \"I didn't feel like I got hit at all,\" said Dalton with a laugh. \"We did a good job in pass protection, picking stuff up and knowing the looks we were getting.\" \nRyan admitted he should have blitzed more or at least rushed four instead of dropping a lineman into coverage several times. \n\"I went with some three-man rush stuff and never let my guys go as much as I should have,\" said Ryan. \"I wanted to put our cover guys out there and we did, but I don't think our guys had enough shots on him.\" \n-- The way the defense responded the next four series after allowing the Bills to go on an 11-play, 80-yard touchdown drive on the first possession of the game. \nThe Skinny: E.J. Manuel started at quarterback in place of injured Tyrod Taylor and LeSean McCoy started at running back after missing the last two games with a hamstring injury and the duo accounted for all 80 yards on the drive. McCoy rushed six times for 44 yards, while Manuel was 3 of 3 passing for 32 yards and rushed two times for four yards and a touchdown. \n\"Their first 15 plays that were scripted were very good to use their best player (McCoy),\" said defensive end Carlos Dunlap. \"They kind of got us off whack, because we hadn't seen those plays. Once they hit us with that we settled in on defense and got back to what we do best - three three-and-outs and then a pick. They had a new quarterback and a running back we weren't sure was going to play. They caught us off guard with a couple of things we weren't sure who was going to play. We settled down and came back and finished strong. \" \nTHREE THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE \n-- Allowing Buffalo to drive 86 yards in 14 plays for a touchdown late in the first half. \nThe Skinny: The Bengals took a 17-7 lead on Mike Nugent's field goal with 7:12 left in the first half and the proceeded to let the Bills use all but the final 17 seconds of the half on the drive. \n\"It was disappointing to give up the touchdown like we did,\" said Lewis. \"We've got to do better than that.\" \n-- The way Jeremy Hill continues to run tentatively. \nThe Skinny: Hill rushed for a team-high 56 yards on 15 carries for just a 3.5 average. He entered the game with just 176 yards and a 3.0 yards per carry average. \nHe did improve in the second half with 43 yards on nine carries and had a 13-yard touchdown reception in the first half thanks to a nice run after the catch. He caught the ball in the left flat, broke a tackle right next to the left sideline, stayed inbound and then somersaulted over a defender to get into the end zone. \n-- The way the Bengals didn't take enough advantage of significantly good field position in the first half. \nThe Skinny: The Bengals first five possessions of the first half had an average starting field position of their own 47, but they didn't score on two of those possessions. \nThey started at their own 49 and punted; the Buffalo 49 and scored a touchdown; the Buffalo 45 and punted; the Bengals 45 and scored a touchdown and the Buffalo 36 and kicked a field goal. \n\"We couldn't get in a rhythm,\" said Green. \"We came back to the locker room, got our tempo going in the third quarter and we were fine.\" \nTHREE STATS/NUMBERS OF NOTE \n-- 30 to 30: The time of possession for each team - exactly 30 minutes apiece. According to pro-football-reference.com it marked the 13th time in NFL history that a game in regulation ended with each team having exactly 30 minutes time of possession each. It's the first time it ever happened in a game the Bengals played. \n-- 4 for 4: In four trips inside the \"Red Zone,\" the Bengals scored touchdowns on all four. That gives them 20 touchdowns in 28 \"Red Zone\" trips this season. They entered Sunday's game ranked eighth in the NFL in \"Red Zone\" touchdown percentage. \nThe Buffalo defense entered the game having allowed just seven touchdowns in 13 \"Red Zone\" trips against it. \n-- 2 for 10: How many successful third down conversions the Bills had after they converted their first three, all of which came on theor opening 11-play, 80-yard touchdown drive. They were 0 for 4 on third down conversion attempts in the second half. \nTHREE QUOTES OF NOTE \n-- Bengals offensive coordinator Hue Jackson on his offensive skill players willing to sacrifice their own stats for the team: \"We're 6-0 and we're 6-0 because we're playing unselfishly right now. I don't think anybody is worried about what the stats are. We're worried about winning. We want to be the winningest offense in football so we don't care where the stats go, who's making them, who's making the plays, who's doing this, let's just play and then then let's look back when it's all said and done and see where we are and if I have to make adjustments then I will.\" \n-- Running back Giovani Bernard on the smile he was shown flashing on his 17-yard second quarter touchdown run on which he was basically untouched: \"There are not too many times in the NFL when you see a wide open hole that anybody can probably run through. I got lucky I was able to be in on that play.\" \n- - Bills linebacker Nigel Bradham on the Bengals 90-yard opening drive of the second half and especially Jones' 42-yard reception: \"Honestly I really feel like we have that to them. We had opportunities to get off the field. We knew what they were going to do. They actually ran the route that we've been getting in practice. We just gave it up.\" \nUP NEXT \nThe bye and then at the Pittsburgh Steelers (4-2) on Nov. 1 at 1 p.m. in Heinz Stadium. \nThe Skinny: The Bengals improved to 6-0 for just the third time in franchise history (they started both the 1975 and 1988 with the same record before losing) and can go to 7-0 for the first time ever against the Steelers, who play at Kansas City this coming Sunday. \n\"Our guys have worked hard,\" said Lewis. \"They've taken care of the first part of the season. This is a chance to look at us and get better. We can put the hammer down and get better in a lot of areas.\" \nNumerous players were asked what 6-0 means: \n-- Said wide receiver Marvin Jones: \"We just have to keep driving the train straight. We know what the focus is and that's something greater, and it's great to start 6-0, but we're chasing something great and we know it.\" \n-- Said wide receiver A.J. Green: \"We have to keep getting better. They bye week came at a great time. We don't have many guys banged up. We can just get our legs back. The next couple of weeks with Pittsburgh and a Thursday night game against Cleveland it's going to be tough.\" \n-- Said defensive end Carlos Dunlap: \"We're not going to relax too long. We're going to take a little of a break, take your mind away from it a little bit, but you don't want to do too much, because obviously it comes to division football now. Now, we're starting to play real football for us, because it's our division.\" \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
