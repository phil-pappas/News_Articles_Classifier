And now Under Armour is his sponsor.\nC hevi peters is a power lifter for the New Hope Bulldogs. After winning at national competition, he went on to capture three medals in lifting at the special Olympics world championships.\nAnd now he has a sponsor, Under Armour\nChevi says, “I’m very excited to get some of the clothing. I don't like to tell my coach, I don't usually sweat. But I love under Armour. It’s comfortable. It’s very relaxing.\"\nHis coach, John Lair, says under Armour likes to support non- traditional athletes rather than big name stars. People who inspire like Chevi.\nLair says, \"I think that Chevi was told so much in his life what he couldn't do and for him to go out and prove what he could do. And prove all the doubters wrong is something. Something with hard work and dedication, anything is possible and Chevi is just all about that.\"\nChevi adds, \"It's very rewarding to me. I’ve gotten to do stuff I was normally not supposed to do. The great thing about being in special Olympics is all the great athletes you meet and compete against them. And then when it’s all over, you tell them congratulations and maybe you’ll get me next time.\"\nThere's no commitment to do commercials just yet but Chevi is eager to share his story with others.\nHe says, \"I do sixteen. different special Olympics sports. It would be kind of a good opportunity to get out there and show them what I can do in under Armour clothing.\"\nAnd he would offer advice for athletes and all.\nChevi says, \"I would just tell them never give up just keep working forward and do your best.\"\nThat's the winning attitude under Armour is getting behind as sponsor.\n coach lair says right now the company has sent all kinds of product and all the new hope athletes love the packages that arrive. he eventually thinks it will lead to financial sponsorship for chevi and the program.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:56:28.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
