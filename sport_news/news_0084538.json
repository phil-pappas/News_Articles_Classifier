There were times he couldn’t even believe what was happening — including during his first conversation with his oncologist, a conversation during which he had to ask his doctor to stop so he could process what he was being told. There were times he spent seven to 10 hours at a time hooked up intravenously in an infusion bed, receiving three or more chemotherapy medications at any one time — six months’ worth of chemotherapy in an eight-week span, he said, a necessary step to combat an aggressive growth of cancer. It was at those times when John Farrell did what he did every day, even before he received his Aug. 10 diagnosis of non-Hodgkin’s Burkitt’s lymphoma. He headed to the ballpark. “There's a choice you can make to put your tail between your legs and feel sorry for yourself, but it was like, 'You know what? The hell with that,’” he said in a conference call with reporters on Friday, as much energy in his voice as there has ever been. Farrell received word from doctors on Thursday that his cancer is in remission, the first and most significant step toward a full recovery from the cancer only discovered because he underwent hernia surgery. He said he will continue to undergo examinations to check for a recurrence of the cancer every three months for the next year and less frequently as time passes. With a clean bill of health, Farrell is clear to resume duties as manager of the Red Sox — duties that include a flight to Arizona today for five days of offseason planning and strategy meetings with the team’s front office. He’s also walking two or three miles per day four or five times a week, he said, and his appetite has returned fully — though he never vomited or lost weight during his chemotherapy treatments. Farrell is back to full health. “It beat me up a little bit physically,” he said, “but, honestly, right now I’m feeling pretty darn good.” By Brian MacPherson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:29:17.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
