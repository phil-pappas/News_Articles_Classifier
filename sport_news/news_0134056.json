Allow me to help. \nThere are plenty of things which the Georgia Bulldogs could (and need to) improve this weekend. Playing the run. Catching the ball. Making better decisions about when to throw the ball. What food to serve at the pre game meal. What movie to watch the night before the game. Really, whatever the Red and Black did last week I hope that they do it better this week. Well enough to win, ideally. \nBut if there's one thing I would really love to see the Bulldogs improve on, it's offensive play calling. I don't want to sound like a cliche. But I think since Coach Schottenheimer , Coach Richt, and half the offensive line already said it this week, I'm comfortable echoing their sentiments: Georgia should have run the ball more against Alabama. Up the middle. Downhill. \nThat sounds nuts, but after going back and watching the film it's right there in living color. Georgia's front 5 wasn't blowing Alabama off the line early. But they were doing a generally good job of getting a hat on a hat. With a strong runner like Nick Chubb that's really what you need. He'll do the rest. Chubb is not what I would call a \"home run threat\" out of the backfield. He doesn't have that lightning speed that a Todd Gurley, for example, does. But there was enough room there for Chubb to have picked up reasonable yardage and force the Tide to play run first. \nGreyson Lambert can play better football than he did on Saturday, but the odds of getting better results out of him increase exponentially if he's given more support in the run game. Against a Tennessee team that has good size up front but seriously lacks depth, Georgia should really run the ball until the Vols prove they can stop it. If Schottenheimer inexplicably goes away from that strategy, I'm going to be very disappointed. But I don't think that will happen. I think this game may have been one of those periodic reminders that every coach needs, a chance to re-evaluate what's central to his unit's identity. Schotty's gonna run the dang ball, y'all. He is going to hammer the hill folk into submission, and a Bulldog offense that got pushed around a bit this past week is going to get a chance to turn the tables. \nAnd when that happens, I hope you'll join me by celebrating with a Schotten-hammer.
