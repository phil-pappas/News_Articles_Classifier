To see him out there now, playing freely, and running around with a smile on his face is outstanding.” \nCarter with 10 points from the match became the first non-England player to pass 100 points at Twickenham. He has become New Zealand’s leading World Cup point scorer with 172, two more than the previous record held by Grant Fox. \nFacing Carter, now in the twilight of his career, was the Springboks’ rising fly-half Handre Pollard who punished the All Blacks for their ill-discipline with five penalties. \nThe penalty count was 13-6 against the All Blacks and coach Steve Hansen said that was worrying ahead of next Saturday’s final. \n“They scored a lot of points from kicks at goal and if we can sort that out it makes it hard for the oppositon. So it’s something we’ve got to look at” before the final, he said. \nIn addition to Carters drop goal he also kicked a penalty and converted tries by Jerome Kaino and Beauden Barrett. \nFor South Africa, Pollard kicked five penalties and Pat Lambie kicked one.
