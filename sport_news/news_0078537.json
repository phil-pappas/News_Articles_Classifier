The reception set up a go-ahead 11-yard touchdown by Desanta Smith.\nSeveral other players stepped up in the second half to get the Eagles in position.\nWith less than six minutes to play in the third quarter, senior J.C. Velez set up the Eagles (4-5) for their first touchdown. Velez took an inside run 40 yards. Wyatt Humphries finished the drive with a 4-yard touchdown to cut the deficit to 22-7.\nA three-and-out by the Hornets (4-5) led to a quick drive by Gibbs. Smith scored from three yards out and the Eagles trailed 22-13 after an unsuccessful two-point conversion attempt.\nAfter a fumble inside the Carter 1-yard line, Gibbs almost lost hope for a comeback. That was until Demarcus Hight intercepted a deep throw from Carter quarterback DeAngelo Brooks on third down.\nA 27-yard run by Dalton Rodgers set up Humphries’ second touchdown of the game.\nCarter fumbled in its own territory on the ensuing possession to set up Smith’s go-ahead score.\nIn the second quarter, Gibbs intercepted a Brooks pass and the Eagles were inside Hornets’ territory for the first time. However, a dropped handoff led to a fumble in the backfield, and Carter linebacker Benjamin Flowers scooped the ball and returned it 62 yards for a touchdown. After a two-point conversion, Carter led 14-0.\nAfter another Gibbs fumble inside its 15, Carter scored on a 1-yard touchdown run from Brooks. Again, Carter managed to score a two-point conversion to lead 22-0 at halftime.\nHeath Cox is a freelance contributor.\nGibbs 26, Carter 22\nCarter 6 16 0 0 — 22\nGibbs 0 0 7 19 — 26\nScoring: C—Isaac Scarbrough 4 run (kick failed); C—Benjamin Flowers 62 fumble recovery (Jake Riley pass from DeAngelo Brooks); C—Brooks 1 run (Bailey Sivyer run); G—Wyatt Humphries 4 run (Logan Wolfenbarger kick); G—Desanta Smith 3 run (kick failed); G—Humphries 3 run (pass failed); G—Smith 11 run (Wolfenbarger kick)\nRecords: Carter 3-6, Gibbs 5-4", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:23:27.426+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
