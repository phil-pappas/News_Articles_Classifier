The field hospital in Afghanistan that U.S. forces bombed earlier this month — killing at least 22 people, including 12 Doctors Without Borders staffers — was known to American officials as a protected medical site, a bombshell report published Thursday claimed.\nU.S. forces bombed the hospital in war-torn Kunduz Oct. 3, killing at least 22 patients and hospital staff. The Pentagon initially said the attack was to protect U.S. troops engaged in a firefight and has since said it was a mistake.\nBut according to the Associated Press, American special operation analysts had gathered intelligence on the facility — known to them as a protected medical site — because they believed it was being used by a Pakistani operative to coordinate Taliban activity.\nIt’s remains unclear whether commanders who unleashed the AC-130 gunship on the hospital were aware that the site was a hospital or knew about the allegations of possible enemy activity.\nThe special operations analysts described in the AP report reportedly assembled a dossier that included maps with the hospital circled, along with indications that intelligence agencies were tracking the location of the Pakistani operative and activity reports based on overhead surveillance, according to a former intelligence official familiar with the material.\nThe intelligence suggested the hospital was being used as a Taliban command and control center and may have housed heavy weapons. After the attack — which came during a battle to retake the northern Afghan city of Kunduz from the Taliban — some U.S. analysts assessed that the strike had been justified, the former officer says.\nDoctors without Borders has condemned the bombing as a war crime. The organization says the strike killed 12 hospital staff and 10 patients, and that death toll may rise.\nIt insists that no gunmen, weapons or ammunition were in the building.\nWith News Wire Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:37:23.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
