Kitchen played as a backup for the Cleveland Browns from 2012-14 before being cut in September.\nWalker went on injured reserve Wednesday after suffered a broken left leg and dislocated ankle. Ngata missed most of the second half Monday with a calf injury and didn't practice Wednesday.\nDETROIT NEWS\nCards' Mathieu on Lions: 'They look out of sync'\nTo make room for Kitchen, the Lions released defensive end Phillip Hunt, who had seven tackles and a sack in the first two games but was inactive the last two weeks.\nKitchen also spent the first few months of his career with the Baltimore Ravens in 2012, when Lions defensive coordinator Teryl Austin was on the coaching staff.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:15:44.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
