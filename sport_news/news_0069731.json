The Royals and Blue Jays play Game 3 of the ALCS in Toronto on Monday night. The Mets and Cubs play Game 3 of the NLCS in Chicago on Tuesday night. Here's a look at what's happening (all times EDT): \n7:00 p.m. \nBlue Jays center fielder Kevin Pillar was hit on the back by a batting practice flyball off the bat of teammate Dioner Navarro. Standing on the warning track in right field, Pillar jokingly fell to the turf. He appeared to be OK. \n6:11 p.m. \nNew York Mets ace Matt Harvey threw in the outfield at Wrigley Field, and the team says he should be fine for Game 5 if the NL Championship Series goes that far. \nHarvey was hit by a comebacker off the bat of Dexter Fowler in the series opener on Saturday night. Manager Terry Collins said Monday that Harvey was \"pretty sore and pretty swelled up,\" but the right-hander came out after Collins talked and looked fine during his brief throwing session. \nHarvey allowed two runs and four hits in 7 2/3 innings in New York's 4-2 win in Game 1. The Mets lead the series 2-0 heading into Game 3 on Tuesday night in Chicago. \n5:23 p.m. \nFans in the upper deck at Rogers Centre for ALCS games between the Blue Jays and Royals are going to be drinking their beer out of plastic cups instead of cans. The Blue Jays banned can sales after fans threw them on the field during a ruckus earlier in the playoffs. \nBlue Jays security and stadium operations head Mario Coutinho says beer will be poured into plastic cups starting Monday night at Game 3. The team reserves the right to cut off beer sales after the fifth inning if there are any problems. \nCoutinho says the Blue Jays did an assessment of the situation with police and then talked it over with Major League Baseball. He wouldn't say how many Toronto police officers would be at Monday's game, but said the number was \"fairly high.\" \n\"We reviewed all our staffing levels and police deployment and we're confident that was adequate,\" Coutinho said. \nIn the seventh inning of Toronto's Game 5 win over Texas in the ALDS, a raucous crowd turned rowdy when Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin hit Texas batter Shin-Soo Choo with his seemingly routine return throw to the pitcher, resulting in a go-ahead run for the Rangers. During an 18-minute delay to sort out the ruling, fans tossed beer cans among other garbage. Many of the cans didn't reach the field, striking fans in the seats close to the field. \n4:20 p.m. \nAbout an hour before batting practice starts ahead of Game 3 of the ALCS, Blue Jays relievers Roberto Osuna and Ryan Tepera were out on the field warming up â€” by playing soccer. The pair kicked an orange ball around in the outfield, then set up a goal. The goalie: a life-sized cutout of a left-handed batter. \nSoccer has been a part of the team's pregame routine all season. Catcher Russell Martin got it kicked off. \n3:47 p.m. \nHours before they hosted Game 3 of the ALCS against the Royals, the Blue Jays were busy. Toronto claimed switch-pitcher Pat Venditte off waivers from the Oakland Athletics and designated for assignment infielder Darwin Barney. Barney was not on the postseason roster. \nThe 30-year-old Venditte made his major league debut this season. He was 2-2 with a 4.40 ERA in 26 relief appearances for the A's. \n2:05 p.m. \nThe Chicago Cubs have started their workout at Wrigley Field on the off day before Game 3 of the NL Championship Series. \nIt is a sunny, windy day in Chicago, and the Cubs are hoping a change of scenery will help them get back in the series against the surging Mets. New York got another homer from Daniel Murphy in a 4-1 victory over Chicago on Sunday night and is just two wins away from a trip to the World Series. \nKyle Hendricks faces Mets right-hander Jacob deGrom on Tuesday night in the first NLCS game at Wrigley since 2003. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:06:50.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
