Josh Buker also caught a 25-yard scoring pass from Vigue and cashed in on the ground from 10 yards. \nIn the Maine Principals' Association Crabtree Point Standings for Class D North, Medomak Valley (4-2, 109.8818 points) is fifth, while MCI (6-0, 150.0000 points) is first in the 12-team region. \nMedomak Valley, along with Camden Hills and Ellsworth/Sumner, are ineligible for postseason play due to those teams playing in lower classes than their enrollements dictate. The Windjammers have canceled the rest of their schedule this fall. \nThe Panthers are in their first year of varsity play. \nCourier Publications' sports staff can be reached by email at sports@villagesoup.com or by phone at 594-4401.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:04:15.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
