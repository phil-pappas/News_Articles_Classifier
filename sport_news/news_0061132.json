I'm not here to be liked. I'm trying to do a good job and I'm privileged to have that role and represent the U.S. Soccer programme.\n\"So I do my best ... and leave the judgement out there for ... people who want to express themselves. Fair enough to have your opinion.\"\nKlinsmann has set a lofty goal of the U.S. reaching the semi-finals of the 2018 World Cup but that target looked a very distant proposition when the Americans were stunned 2-1 by lowly Jamaica in the Gold Cup semi-final in July.\nPainful loss\nThat was followed by a painful penalty shootout loss to Panama in the playoff match for third place at a tournament where the U.S. had reached the final for the previous five years.\n\"I don't want to make any excuses for what happened in the Gold Cup,\" said Klinsmann, who coached Germany from 2004 to 2006 before taking over the U.S. job in 2011. \"I said the Gold Cup was heavily influenced because of refereeing decisions.\n\"And we didn't win this game because they (Mexico) scored a goal two minutes before the end. The game was very even, especially in the first half we had enough chances to score a second or third goal.\n\"The second half belonged more to Mexico but we turned it around in overtime. We were closer to a third goal than Mexico.\"\nWhile Klinsmann will face his share of criticism following Saturday's game, he and his team earned welcome praise from Landon Donovan, the all-time top scorer for the U.S. who retired from the game in December 2014.\n\"Congrats to both teams, what an incredible game. Sad that the #USA lost but a great day for the sport,\" Donovan tweeted.\n\"Three great subs by Klinsmann. Two combined on the goal and Brad Evans takes penalties regularly if it goes to a shootout.\"\nForward Bobby Wood equalised for the U.S. in extra time after latching on to an exquisite through ball from fellow substitute DeAndre Yedlin, but defender Paul Aguilar scored the decisive goal 10 minutes later with a thunderous volley.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:47:47.985+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
