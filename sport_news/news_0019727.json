Comment By Tim Whelan Jr./Daily News Staff Milford Daily News By Tim Whelan Jr./Daily News Staff Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 9:00 PM By Tim Whelan Jr./Daily News Staff Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 9:00 PM MEDWAY — As the referee blew the final whistle on the Medway girls soccer team’s convincing 3-0 victory over Westwood at Joseph P. Hanlon Field, Mustangs coach Jason Rojee and his players lined up for the customary postgame handshake. Sitting nearby and holding their daughter Grace, Aubrie Rojee had a question for her husband. “Was that One-five-oh?” she asked with a smile. Sensing a reporter was nearby, the coach gave a playful, “Shhh.” The cat was already out of the bag. Thanks in large part to two goals from senior tri-captain Sarah DiPillo, Rojee reached 150 wins in his 13th year at the program’s helm. “I’ve actually lost more games than I’ve won in my coaching career,” he said with a laugh after his team, which has outscored opponents 35-7 this season, improved to 10-1-1 (10-1 TVL). “It goes in cycles. … Now we’re back up to the 15, 16, 17 a year. So it’s nice. “It says a lot about the youth, the feeder program. The girls really take it seriously here. We have a lot of club players. They make you look good.” Among them is DiPillo. The Mustangs, who won 1-0 at Westwood earlier this season, had plenty of chances to put goals away early against the Wolverines (3-8-1, 3-7-1 TVL) but were having trouble capitalizing. Then in the game’s 14th minute, junior midfielder Alexa Rasmussen sent a cross from the left side to the front of the net, and DiPillo was there to put it past Westwood goalkeeper Jamie Burke (14 saves). That 1-0 score stood until halftime, as several other Medway chances soared just wide or just over the net. “We were flat,” Rojee said of his team’s start. “We’ve been having trouble getting up for day games, which is the tough thing when you play 80 percent of your games at night. … (Westwood) can lull you in. They play a defensive style that if you don’t capitalize, it’ll catch up to you.” In the second half, the Mustangs got back to their capitalizing ways as junior tri-captain Shannon Aviza curled a shot with her left foot from outside the box and past a sprawling Burke. Sophomore defender Anna Brewer got the assist on Aviza’s tally. Both teams played to a stalemate for the rest of the half until DiPillo put home a shot off a chip pass from fellow senior tri-captain Shannon Simmons with less than two minutes remaining. Medway junior keeper Erin O’Rourke earned the shutout. For the team’s leaders, particularly DiPillo, Simmons, and Aviza, they know how good these Mustangs can be after they reached the Division 3 South final last year before falling to Dedham on penalty kicks. Page 2 of 2 - “It’s really good to get that team connection and team unity going into the tournament,” said DiPillo. “We just qualified our last game vs. Norton, so we want to keep that momentum going.” While the Mustangs appear to be clicking at the right time, they have been without key contributors, namely junior Kaelyn Beach, a starter her freshman and sophomore seasons before tearing her quad this summer. Additionally, Beach’s classmate Kensie Coakley has missed the last several weeks with a back injury, while sophomore midfielder Emily Ertman recently suffered a knee injury. “Even though the girls are hurt, they’re on the sideline every day cheering us on,” DiPillo said. “We’re picking them up too because they are injured. It’s a next girl up mentality. We’re just together, working as a team.” Added Rojee, “I think they rally around each other. … When you lose one, everybody else needs to move around. (Sophomore) Abby Murphy’s playing a heck of a center back even though she’s a midfielder. So, they step up.” And for 13 years, Rojee has been stepping up for his players. “Tremendously,” DiPillo said when asked how much her coach’s guidance has helped her. “He’s given me so much advice, and I’m really grateful for that.” The coach on the opposing sideline lauded Rojee and his team. “I respect the coaches in this league,” said Westwood coach Tim Chant, “and Jay’s one of them who always seems to put it together.” One-five-oh is in the books.
