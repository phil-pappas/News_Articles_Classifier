Henderson finished the job late in the second quarter after end Daeshon Hall applied pressure but couldn't wrap up Allen. Arkansas, which protected Allen well for most of the game, had been one of five Football Bowl Subdivision teams that had yet to allow a sack. A&M entered Saturday leading the FBS with 15 sacks.\nA&M freshman quarterback Kyler Murray entered the game on A&M's first drive of the second half. He rushed three straight times -- for gains of 17, 4 and 5 yards -- before starter Kyle Allen returned. A&M settled for a field goal on the drive, taking a 13-7 lead. Murray led Allen High to three state titles at AT&T Stadium.\nArkansas held the ball for all but 3:21 of the first quarter, allowing A&M just seven plays.\nA&M sophomore Donovan Wilson grabbed an interception in the second quarter, his second in as many games. Brandon Allen was 13 of 13 before the pick, which came on fourth-and-7 from the A&M 35.\nA&M freshman receiver Christian Kirk had three receptions for 130 yards in the second quarter alone. He has recorded 100-yard games in three of the first four games of his career, matching Mike Evans (2012) and Uzoma Nwachukwu (2009) for the school freshman record for 100-yard games in a season.\nArkansas took a 7-0 lead in the first quarter. Brandon Allen hit Drew Morgan downfield on second-and-21 for a first down. Allen hit Morgan again on third-and-3 from the A&M 17 for the touchdown.\nWith his touchdown pass to Morgan in the first quarter, Brandon Allen became the seventh Arkansas quarterback to pass for more than 5,000 career yards.\nA second-quarter tackle for loss by Razorbacks junior defensive end Jeremiah Ledbetter turned out to be a four-point play. After driving to the Arkansas 2 prior to the sack, A&M had to settle for a field goal, taking a 10-7 lead into halftime.\nA&M's Kyle Allen started the game 8 of 8 passing. His first incompletion came on a pass to the end zone on third down in the second quarter.\nIn the first half, the Razorbacks were flagged for four offensive holding calls and six total penalties for 50 yards.\nArkansas starting fullback Kody Walker was held out with a hand injury.\nKate Hairopoulos, Randy Jennings\nNo. 14 Texas A&M 28, Arkansas 21\nFull coverage Visit the Texas A&M page\nHairopoulos: Instant replay ... like in 2014, Aggies rally, top Arkansas in OT 28-21\nDeja blue: Arkansas' Bielema sees losing trend continue with another OT loss to A&M\nTexas A&M quick hits: Aggies post first sack vs. Arkansas this season; Razorbacks hog the ball\nFive thoughts: Red zone struggles for A&M, but freshman WR Kirk continues to impress\nPhotos: Hugs for Reveille; lots of tailgate action before Aggies rally to top Arkansas 28-21 in OT\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/26/hairopoulos-instant-replay-like-2014-aggies-rally-top-arkansas-ot-28-21", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/26/deja-blue-arkansas-bielema-sees-losing-trend-continue-another-ot-loss", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegephotos/2015/09/26/photos-hugs-reveille-lots-tailgate-action-aggies-rally-top-arkansas-28-21-ot", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texas-aggies", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/26/texas-quick-hits-aggies-post-first-sack-vs-arkansas-season-razorbacks-hog-ball", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/26/five-thoughts-14-texas-comes-behind-defeat-arkansas-razorbacks-28-21-overtime"], "published": "2015-09-27T06:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:54:58.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
