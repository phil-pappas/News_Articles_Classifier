This inspired me to develop a more convenient, compact, space-saving solution.\"\nHe created a prototype for the REEL MC COY to make it easier to switch between various reels. The unit eliminates the need to carry several rods and reels to and from the fishing spot. It features a space-saving design. The accessory makes fishing less stressful and more enjoyable. Additionally, it does not require the use of tools.\nThe original design was submitted to the Lancaster office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
