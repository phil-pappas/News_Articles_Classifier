Algonac is back in the playoffs for the first time since 2005. Marine City just grew its playoff streak to 18 straight years of postseason football. \nHowever, are teams done writing their legacy? Will the energy and magic of the regular season fade, or will players continue to make themselves into local legends? \nThe state will find out in the next month with the answers given at the state finals at Ford Field. Before any team runs out of the tunnel at the biggest stadium they’ll likely ever play in, they need to start knocking out wins in districts. Division 4 Croswell-Lexington (6-3) at Richmond (8-1), 7 p.m. Friday Marysville (7-2) at Pontiac Notre Dame Prep (7-2), TBD \nWill it be the Blue Devils night on Devil’s Night? We’ll have to wait until Friday night to see, but they’ve already beat the Pioneers 35-12 in week three. However, Cros-Lex has certainly grown since that game, highlighted by their dramatic 28-27 win against Almont in week eight. \nThe Pioneers will be searching for their first district title since 2012, and the Blue Devils will be looking for their second straight. \nMarysville carries its six-game win streak on the road as they’ll face Notre Dame Prep. The Fighting Irish have lost twice this season, but both losses were to Division 7 powerhouse Detroit Loyola. Division 5 Clintondale (6-3) at Algonac (8-1), 7 p.m. Friday Marine City (6-3) at Almont (7-2), TBD \nYou’ve might have read this 100 times, but Algonac is in the playoffs for the first time in a decade. They’ll be looking to slay the Clintondale Dragons, who ended their season with two close losses and a forfeit win in week nine against Mount Clemens. \nThe Muskrats, on the other hand, just set a school record in their final game against Brown City by totaling 321 points on the season – the most in program history. \nNo Marine City or Almont fan could forget last year’s district finals showdown. Both teams came into the game unbeaten, but it was Almont’s hard-hitting, suffocating defense that pushed them to a 35-7 win before falling in the state semifinals. \nThe Mariners have been playing in the playoff mindset for a while, winning their last three games of the season to guarantee themselves a playoff spot with a 6-3 record. Division 7 Unionville-Sebewaing (5-4) at Sandusky (9-0), 7 p.m. Friday Cass City (7-2) at Ubly (7-2), 7 p.m. Friday \nSandusky’s closest call in their perfect season came in a 28-22 win against, you guessed it, Unionville-Sebewaing. From there, the Redskins walked into their Greater Thumb Conference East schedule and showed no mercy, winning every game by at least 20 points. \nWith Sandusky’s 56-0 win against Capac on Friday, the Redskins set a program record with 365 points on the season. 8-man Peck (7-2) at Deckerville (8-1), 7 p.m. Friday New Haven Merritt Academy (7-2) at Morrice (8-1), TBD \nDeckerville and Peck are two staples in the 8-man football playoffs, and they’ll faceoff on the first night of playoffs. The Eagles completely controlled their matchup earlier in the season as they beat the Pirates 50-6 in week eight. \nDeckerville’s lone loss on the season came against Morrice, but it was a nail-biting 34-30 game. 2 CONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://bwne.ws/1N1t0B5 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T10:48:19.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
