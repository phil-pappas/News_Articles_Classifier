Or it’s preseason and doesn’t mean anything. For me personally, I’m in the middle. I think the preseason is preparation for the season. That’s what the ‘pre’ stands for. And you have to prepare to win.\n“Guys are doing that. That doesn’t always translate when we open up in Milwaukee (Oct. 28). But in getting the idea there’s a certain way to play the game that leads to winning, that’s good to put in guys’ minds. Hopefully it does carry over.’’\nThe Knicks won without a good night from Carmelo Anthony, who shot just 4 of 14 for eight points. But they held Boston to 39.7 percent shooting, and Derrick Williams pumped in another 19 points to follow his 23-point and 21-point oubursts.\nArron Afflalo made his Knicks’ debut in a starting role and looked sharp despite playing just eight minutes. He scored eight points (3 of 6 shooting) with five rebounds.\nWith 7-foot-3 Kristaps Porzingis out with a quad strain, Kyle O’Quinn picked up the slack with a double-double — 13 points and 11 rebounds. Fisher still thinks O’Quinn fits better in a reserve role behind Porzingis, who will returns Saturday in Charlotte. The Knicks finish the preseason Friday in Boston.\n“Kyle does good things for our team,’’ Fisher said. “It’s about the balance of our roster. We’re fortunate enough with the way our roster is built, whoever starts or comes off the bench they can play. Regardless of who starts at power forward, we have a guy coming who can also get it done. He’s playing well.’’\nAnthony said it’s not definite, but hinted he would sit out Saturday’s game. \nPorzingis plans to play Saturday after having a workout with the coaches before Friday’s game. He will face fellow rookie big man Frank Kaminsky , the ninth pick who was high on the Knicks’ board. \n“He feels great,’’ Fisher said of Porzingis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:18:42.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
