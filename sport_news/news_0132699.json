He was 74.\nThe funeral home handling the arrangements near where he lived in Ohio confirmed Chance died.

Earlier that month, he pitched a five-inning perfect game.\nChance went 128-115 with a 2.92 ERA in 10 seasons. He began with the expansion Los Angeles Angels in 1961 and also pitched for Minnesota, Cleveland, the Mets and Detroit.\nThe two-time All-Star was well known for his exploits off the field, too. With teammate Bo Belinsky, he would pal around Hollywood with the likes of Frank Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe.\nShare this page Tweet This article filed under: MLB Baseball Pro Men Associated Press", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-12T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:19:56.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
