The Ravens, three seasons after beating the 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII, fell to 1-5.\nKaepernick's scoring strikes came on a season-long 76-yard connection with Torrey Smith in the first half, and on a 21-yard, third-down throw to Quinton Patton for a 25-13 lead with 10:52 remaining.\nAfter giving up a last-minute touchdown last Sunday in a 30-27 loss to the New York Giants, the 49ers had to keep the Ravens from doing the same.\nBaltimore had 66 seconds to drive 80 yards for a go-ahead score. They reached the 35 with 13 seconds left but could get no further, with Eric Reid batting down Joe Flacco's desperation pass into the end zone as time expired.\nKaepernick passed for a season-high 340 yards, completing 16 of 27 passes with the two touchdowns and no interceptions.\nFlacco was 33 of 53 for 343 yards, and his two interceptions were offset by two touchdown passes after halftime.\nThe 49ers' lead shrank to 25-20 with 5:14 remaining, when Flacco found Kamar Aiken on a fourth-down, 2-yard touchdown pass.\nBut the 49ers were able to run the clock on the ensuing series, boosted by a 16-yard catch from Patton and a defensive holding penalty on Jimmy Smith, the latter of which kept the 49ers from having to punt with 2:26 left.\nStaking the 49ers to a 13-3 lead was Kaepernick's 76-yard bomb to Smith. It was their longest connection of the season, albeit just a yard longer than a Week 2 hookup at Pittsburgh.\nThe Ravens pulled within 19-13, when Steve Smith beat Kenneth Acker for a 34-yard touchdown catch with 2:29 left in the third quarter. Acker wanted Smith to get called for pushing off on the play.\nThe Ravens tried closing within 19-16, but Justin Tucker slipped on a 45-yard field-goal attempt, which clanked off the right post early in the fourth quarter.\nRather than sit on the lead, the 49ers saw Kaepernick go deep to Anquan Boldin for a 51-yard reception with 12:17 remaining, moving them to the Ravens' 25-yard line. Three snaps later, on third-and-6, Kaepernick stayed in the pocket and found Patton wide open, courtesy of former 49ers cornerback Shareece Wright falling down in coverage.\nDawson's fourth field goal in four attempts gave the 49ers a 19-6 lead to protect for the final 22 1/2 minutes.\n(c)2015 San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.)\nVisit the San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.) at www.mercurynews.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1739835&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1739835", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1739835&h=49ers+hold+off+Ravens%2C+25%2D20"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:43:45.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
