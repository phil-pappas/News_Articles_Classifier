Always will, he’s convinced. \n“It’s something that will stick with me every day,” said the cross country coach at Iowa City Regina. “And as we approached this day, it’s been weighing on me a lot.” \nThe Regals unburdened him somewhat Thursday. \nRegina’s boys placed three runners in the top 15 and captured the Class 1A district title at Seminole Valley Park. The Regals scored 83 points to outrun defending state champion Bellevue (106). Wapello was third with 144. \nLast year, Swope mistakenly sent his teams to the course at Solon a few days before their state qualifier. That’s against state rules. Regina self-reported the infraction, and the IHSAA and IGHSAU disqualified the Regals from competition before they got to the starting line. \n“Chad blames himself for it all the time,” said Regina’s Emilio Tovar, who led the charge with a ninth-place finish. “I got over it a week after state. He needs to stop beating himself up about it. \n“But yes, it was prime motivation for this day.” \nRegina’s girls also will be making the trip to Kennedy Park near Fort Dodge for the Oct. 31 state meet, earning a third-place finish. \nElkader Central won it with 47 points. Then it was Starmont (83) and Regina (92). \n“We lost our top five girls from last year,” Swope said. “And we have a kid (Molly Vittetoe) who had been our seventh runner most of the year, and she drops 2 1/2 minutes and runs third for us today.” \nBoth of the individual favorites won handily. \nTop-ranked Alyssa Williams of Durant got away from the pack immediately and motored through the course in 18:26, building a 46-second margin over runner-up Camryn Reeg of Bellevue. Haley Schroeder of Central was third. \nBellevue’s Andrew Meyer, also ranked No. 1 in 1A, led a 1-2 finish by the Comets, completing the 5,000 meters in 16:09. Teammate Andrew Segalla was second in 16:26, then Keiffer Sexton of Highland was third. \nThe top 15 individuals from each state qualifier join the top three teams in Fort Dodge. \nCLASS 1A STATE-QUALIFYING CROSS COUNTRY MEET \nAt Seminole Valley Park \nGirls Results \nTeams (top 3 qualify for state) — 1.
