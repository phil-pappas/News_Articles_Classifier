And perhaps you're not as excited for this Sunday's matchup as you were, say, five weeks ago, but it's certainly been circled on millions of calendars in New England. \nIt seems Patriots fans and media have focused on one common theme for this week: revenge. \nFunny, you'd think the team that lost 45-7 with a chance to go to the Super Bowl would be the one's looking for a little bit of payback, but that's far from the case here. (Thanks very much, Deflategate.) \n• The New York Daily News' Gary Myers predicts the Patriots and Tom Brady will be out for revenge for the Colts' whistle-blowing role in DeflateGate. \n\"Brady and Belichick have been on a Deflategate Revenge Tour and the highlight will be what they do to the Colts in Lucas Oil Stadium. \n\"The Patriots are 4-0 and Brady has been flawless with 11 touchdowns and no interceptions. He's just been warming up for what he surely has planned for the Colts. Belichick has never backed off trying to run up the score and Brady has always been his willing accomplice. If there was ever a game when Brady wanted to humiliate another team, this is it.\" Doyel: Patriots-Colts rematch not what we had in mind \n• Sticking with that revenge theme, the Boston Herald's Steve Buckley writes that if you think the 2007 meeting between these two teams, which was \"billed as the biggest regular-season game evah ,\" was something, you haven't seen anything yet. As a taste, his column finishes with \"Break out the tire irons.\" \n\"If the Colts felt compelled to drop a dime or two after their Gillette Stadium annihilation in the AFC title game, so be it. All's fair in love, war, television ratings and, especially, football. But it makes no difference to Pats fans: Sunday's game is going to be personal in a way that the 2007 Battle of the Undefeateds, which the Pats won 24-20, was not.\" \n• NESN.com's Doug Kyed says the Colts-Patriots rivalry turned embarrassing long before DeflateGate, and that won't change Sunday as Indy has \"no chance to beat their biggest rivals.\" \n\"The Patriots, to Colts fans, are dirty cheaters. The Patriots are presumed to have only beaten the Colts in six straight occasions through nefarious methods. \n\"The Colts, to Patriots supporters, are whiners, snitches and losers. The only reason to hate the Colts, rather than empathize with them, is because they set off the most annoying sports scandal in history. \n\"Quite frankly, it's turned into a sad rivalry for the Colts. Indianapolis had their moments against the Patriots, but clutching onto distant memories from 2006 seems pitiful now that Peyton Manning's career is winding down with the Denver Broncos, Tony Dungy is an analyst on NBC and the Patriots are fresh off a Super Bowl XLIX victory. \n\"...The Colts can't beat the Patriots on the game field, so they tried to destroy them through a deflated football scandal this offseason. They would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for that meddling U.S. District Court Judge Richard Berman, who overturned Tom Brady's four-game suspension.\" Insider: Deflategate? Doesn't matter; Patriots own Colts \n• The Boston Globe's Karen Guregian points out that the Colts, even without Andrew Luck, are -- for the lack of a better word -- lucky to be 3-2 and are worlds away from competing with the unbeaten Patriots. \n\"If (the Colts) couldn't beat the Pats last year when they weren't in turmoil, how are they possibly going to stand up to a team that has crushed them six straight times and wants to do worse damage this time out? \n\"On a good day, without all the internal drama causing issues, they'd still have a hard time not getting creamed by Brady & Co., who are on a major roll and seem capable of weathering any storm. \n\"... It is a new year, but the history and the Colts' current state can't help but play into this looking like it might turn into a slaughter.\" \n• Michael Whitmer of the Boston Globe focuses on one troubling trend for Colts fans: Andrew Luck has never beaten the Patriots. In fact, Whitmer points out that \"over the last 222 game minutes against New England, (Luck hasn't) taken one snap with his team in the lead.\" \n\"It seems that whatever it takes to beat Luck and the Colts, the Patriots have been able to do... What does all this mean when it comes to Sunday night's game? Nothing, as Belichick will remind you. But it sure leaves Patriots fans flush with confidence.\" \n• Michael Hurley of CBS Boston says Deflategate will have little bearing on Sunday's outcome: the Patriots won't need extra motivation to steamroll the Colts. In fact, Hurley says one might feel sorry for Colts players ahead of the beating they'll receive. \n\"There are reasons to feel sympathy for the players who will take the field for the Colts on Sunday night. Certainly, the Patriots won't feel any desire to take it easy on the Colts, and if the game goes the way a game should go between two teams with such great disparities, it ought to be an interesting to see how the Patriots choose to proceed. A message to the owner and the general manager of Indianapolis' football team might be in order.\" 209 CONNECT 13 TWEET 1 LINKEDIN 45 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://indy.st/1RHB4a7 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:38:37.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
