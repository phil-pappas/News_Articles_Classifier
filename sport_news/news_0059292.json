The No. 21 Rams swept the Falcons for the 23rd consecutive time at Moby Arena. ( Trevor L. Davis/ Loveland Reporter-Herald ) \nFORT COLLINS — Not that it wasn't threatened, but the streak continues. \nNo. 21 Colorado State entered Saturday's match against Air Force having won 43 straight against the Falcons on the volleyball court, including 22 consecutive sweeps at Moby Arena. Now it's 23, thanks to a 27-25, 25-18, 25-21 decision that keeps the Rams perfect in Mountain West play (6-0), 13-3 overall. But as the scores suggest, it took some doing in both the first and third sets as CSU had to rally from deficits in both. \nAnd from the crowd, CSU coach Tom Hilbert could hear the groans, though he didn't think they were warranted. \n\"We played at a very high level, but Air Force is good, and I think people need to realize that that's a really good team,\" he said. \"If we were playing that same thing against Wyoming or New Mexico, people would think, 'ah, that team's pretty good. People don't want to accept it, but Air Force is pretty good.\" \nIn the first, the Falcons held three match points with a 24-21 lead, due mostly to the play of outside hitter Akokwe Clement, who had eight kills in the set alone. The Rams pulled even, then trailed 25-24 before a pair of kills from Alex Reid sandwiched one from Alexandra Poletto to close the set. \nIn the third, the Rams trailed 20-18, pulled even and never trailed again as Grace Gordon served five straight points — the final one an ace — and Acacia Andrews put together a block and a kill to end the night. Advertisement \nDominating a team so much historically does enter a player's mind, but it doesn't necessarily play a role in the outcome. \n\"When you're coming in, like they were a really good team. This is a really good Air Force team,\" Andrews said. \"They're just an older team from last year, and I know we struggled last year at Air Force, so I think coming in we had to take them seriously.\" \nIt was an offensive match, as the Rams hit .352 as a team, the Falcons .268. It marked the first time this season in a three-set match Colorado State had three players finish with double-digit kills, led by Reid with 13, while the middles did damage all night, Poletto with 11 and Andrews with 10. \nHilbert felt Air Force passed exceptionally at times, while his team was on all match. \n\"There was a lot of kills for a three-set match,\" CSU coach Tom Hilbert said. \"It reminded me of a men's match, because the sideout percentages were so high; in sets one and three, it was outrageous.\" \nIn a sport where most of the attention goes to the pins, Colorado State's middles played so well they couldn't be ignored, each taking advantage of their time on the court. \nAndrews said it was a nice change to have them both contributing overall on the same night. \n\"I think early on in the season, it was always one of us would be having a good blocking night and one of us would have a good hitting night,\" Andrews said. \"So we were like, 'I've got hitting, you've got blocking, you're doing great.' Tom was like, 'OK, maybe you both should do both.'\" \nAndrews led the team in blocking, posting five, one solo. Poletto contributed two as the Rams finished with 7.5. And while there is little conversation between the two during a match, they do feed off each other. \n\"What's fun is when you tell your team, this is going to work, you guys can do this, and they both approach it with this attitude that I'm going to have an impact on the game and then they do,\" Hilbert said. \nThe Rams also aided their cause at the service line, posting six aces in the match (three from Colaizzi), with Hilbert highlighting Gordon's for the timing in which it occurred. Colaizzi also led the team with 13 digs, while Adrianna Culbert and and Cassidy Denny each had nine. Culbert finished with nine kills and led the team with 26 assists, just missing her fifth triple-double of the season. \nThe Rams were able to slow down Clement a bit, as she had five more kills the rest of the high, though fellow outside hitter Shelley Spires matched her total with 13. However, they were the only two true threats. \nIt sets up a key match Tuesday night as the Rams host Wyoming, a team just a half game behind them in the Mountain West standings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:46:08.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
