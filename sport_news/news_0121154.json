So when you get a good Quote: , man is it great for the rest of us out there. Luckily, Brad Marchand has given us such a Quote: .\nAdChoices\nMarchand on Marchand-Bergeron-Seguin line: \"I was very fortunate to be on a line with two great players: myself and Bergy.\" @tseguinofficial\n— DJ Bean (@DJ_Bean) October 1, 2015\nThis is absolutely fantastic. Marchand is mostly known as a pest, and for him to throw some “shade” at one of the best young players in the game is a treat for the fans and media. Surely this was all in jest, but this is the type of stuff that remains as bulletin board material when the teams play one another. It will do nothing but motivate a player like Seguin, who would love nothing more then to show up his former teammates.\nWhile the Quote: wasn’t malicious, it sure is something juicy for all of us on the other side of the boards and allows us to get an inside look into what the players are thinking.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "https://twitter.com/DJ_Bean/status/649635513536782336?ref_src=twsrc^tfw", "https://twitter.com/DJ_Bean/status/649635513536782336", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/tseguinofficial"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:12:36.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
