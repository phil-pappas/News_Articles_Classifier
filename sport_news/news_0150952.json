Smith of the Journal Sentinel Oct. 10, 2015 3:23 p.m. (0) Comments Paul A. Smith The Chippewa Musky Club had a lure manufacturer inscribe a blade on a spinner bait in recognition of the club's 40th anniversary. Photo taken Sept. 19, 2015 by Paul A. Smith. Courtesy of Jim Lehmann A 34-inch northern pike was caught and released by Jim Lehmann during the 40th annual fishing outing of the Chippewa Musky Club. The club had a lure manufacturer inscribe a blade on a spinner bait in recognition of the occasion. \nHayward — Carl Klein of Wausau started the day just like hundreds of other fishing outings on the Chippewa Flowage over the last four decades: Before dawn, he went to the water's edge and made an offering to Chiznuaw, an American Indian who lived and died near the Chippewa River. \nKlein tossed a token into the shallows and repeated his now-familiar request. \n\"I appreciate having another day to fish on the flowage,\" Klein said. \"And I'd be grateful for any good fortune you send my way today.\" \nKlein had a game plan in mind for the day, just like usual. And per his habits, his boat was gassed up, his tackle was well-organized, his hooks were sharpened. \nBut this day was different in one notable regard. It marked the 40th annual gathering of the Chippewa Musky Club, a group he and friends started in 1976. \n\"I guess it means we've made more than a few casts,\" said Dean Hoffman of Brookfield, also a charter member. \"And we haven't gotten tired of it yet.\" \nAnd even with the respects paid to Chiznuaw, the club members knew there was no guarantee of landing a musky. They come for camaraderie, fresh air, tradition and adventure. And the chance to catch the fish of a lifetime. \nThe club — an unofficial title, the group has no dues and no rules — typically meets on the Chippewa Flowage in spring for the fishing opener and in the fall for a three-day outing. \nThis year's gathering was held Sept. 19-21. It was attended by eight members: Hoffman; Klein; Jim Henke of Amherst; Andy Hirsh of St. Louis, Mo.; Alex Hoffman (Dean's son) of Milwaukee; Jim Lehmann of Ashwaubenon; Wayne Weber of Leawood, Kan.; and Derrick Weber (Wayne's nephew) of Pittsburg, Mo. \nDean Hoffman, Henke, Klein and Lehman were at the first outing in 1976. \nAlex Hoffman, Hirsh and Derrick Weber are in their 20s and 30s and are part of the club's second generation. \nThe group has also had outings on other waters, including the Turtle Flambeau Flowage near Mercer and on Lake of the Woods in northern Minnesota and Ontario. \nBut they have fished the \"Big Chip\" faithfully for four decades. \n\"It's just so beautiful,\" Klein said. \"And once you start to get to know the spots, it brings you back.\" \nThe club's history helps illustrate the value of fishing in Wisconsin's culture and economy. \nThe Chippewa Musky Club started as a loose group of friends from school and work. They had one common denominator — they enjoyed fishing. \nThe club members share responsibilities. Dean Hoffman does most of the cooking. Carl is the fishing guide. Wayne Weber is the bookkeeper. \nDick Hoffman (Dean's brother) of Arlington Heights, Ill., is \"director of naps.\" \n\"The first year, it was hot in August,\" Dean Hoffman said. \"We decided to pack the cars, pull a couple boats and have a road trip up north.\" \nThe first several years the club members camped on islands in the flowage, including Chipmunk Island. \nKlein vividly recalls the tent they used — a 1972 Sears, Roebuck & Co. cabin tent, 9 by 12 feet, orange and blue. \nThe club evolved from roughing it on islands to camping at sites with running water and electricity to staying in cabins and resorts. \nIn the early years, they often hired fishing guides to help them learn where to focus their efforts on the vast, structure-filled flowage. \nIn short order, the club members knew the names and locations of prime fishing spots as well as they know their spouses' names and birth dates. \nPete's Bar, Pork Barrel, Meat Market, Eagle's Nest, Big Stump, Henke's Patch. \nThe club also was quick to learn and honor the legend of Chiznuaw, a Chippewa Indian who lived in a cabin on Lake Pokegama, one of the seven natural lakes that now are part of the Chippewa Flowage. \nChiznuaw drowned in the lake before the flowage was formed. But his spirit lives on in the area, Klein said. \nThe club created a Chiznuaw Award (also called Cheezio) for the angler who catches the longest musky of the year. \nThe 2015 outing was held after a cold front passed through Wisconsin. The first day was fished under high blue skies and in water temps that had dropped by a couple degrees overnight. \nThree boats of anglers produced only one follow on Saturday. It happened about 6:30 p.m. when a 40-inch musky followed Klein's jerk bait to the boat near Deer Foot Island. \n\"Oh, oh, oh,\" Klein said, pulling the lure in a figure 8. The musky sank out of sight. \nThe club gathered around a campfire that evening to dine on grilled steaks and have a celebration. Guests included John and Brenda Detloff, who run Indian Trail Resort on the flowage. John also is a fishing guide the club members used often over the years. \nThe group told stories and viewed old photos. \"I don't remember Henke ever having hair,\" Dean Hoffman laughed. \nThe ability to share experiences in the outdoors creates tighter friendships. \n\"We know, at least once a year, we've got a date on the calendar,\" Klein said. \nWisconsin sells about 1.4 million fishing licenses each year; the quality of its environment and fisheries is critical to retaining anglers. \nHirsh and Derrick Weber have yet to catch a musky; they drive more than 10 hours each way to the Badger State for the chance to catch one. \nResident and nonresident anglers generate an economic impact of nearly $2.3 billion per year in Wisconsin, according to the American Sportfishing Association. \nAlthough club members have boated dozens of muskies over the years, they know the fishing gods are fickle. Even kind thoughts and generous offerings don't guarantee a muskellunge in the net. \nAction on the three-day outing increased with each passing day. \nAfter the 40-inch fish followed Klein's lure on the first day, several follows by muskies and a pair of strikes were reported on Day 2. Also, Lehman boated a 34-inch northern pike that day; the fish hit a commemorative 40th CMC bucktail spinner bait. \nThen on Monday morning, all boats were on the water early and had a follow or strike by 7. Several hits were on surface lures. \nLater in the day a musky grabbed a sucker Hoffman was trailing from his boat. But it dropped the bait before Hoffman could set the hook. \nThe club members fished hard into the evening. \nOn Hirsh's last cast in the darkness, a musky struck as he performed a figure 8 boat side. But the hooks did not hold. \nHirsh, one of the junior members, will return next year in his quest to catch his first musky. \n\"What a way to end the day,\" Hoffman said. \"If it were easy, we probably would have gotten tired of it. We're looking forward to next year like it will be our first.\" \nSend email to psmith@journalsentinel.com © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc. All rights reserved. About Paul A.
