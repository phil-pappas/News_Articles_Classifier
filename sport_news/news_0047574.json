(Photo: Matt_Kryger/The_Star) \nWhile The Franchise watched from the sidelines for the first time in his career, clipboard in hand, tennis shoes on feet, the Indianapolis Colts tried to do something they haven’t done since 2011. \nThat is: Win a game without Andrew Luck. \nThey did, scraping by 16-13 in overtime over the hapless Jacksonville Jaguars . And they can thank Jason Myers for that. \nMyers might not have a seat on the Jags’ flight home, not after missing two field goals with a chance to seal the victory. And in reality, he missed three. Myers botched two tries from 53 yards in the waning seconds but the first was negated because the Colts called timeout just before the kick. \nHe missed another from 49 yards in overtime. \nIt was enough. Barely. Matt Hasselbeck, the Colts’ 40-year-old backup quarterback, engineered a six-play, 53-yard drive that was capped by a 27-yard field goal from Adam Vinatieri. It was the 25th game-winning field goal of Vinatieri’s gilded career. \nIt wasn’t pretty — wasn’t even close. But the Colts got the two things they needed: A victory and some rest for Andrew Luck. \nIt was a strange reality, the Matt Hasselbeck Era in Indianapolis. However long it lasts – could be a few weeks, could be one game – the 17-year veteran did what was asked of him Sunday. Hasselbeck won the football game. \nHe didn’t win with style, or sizzle, or spectacle, the way Andrew Luck often wins football games, but in this predicament that hardly matters. The Colts wanted a win and wanted to get out of here, allowing their starting quarterback the rest he needs for that sore throwing shoulder.
