Those games, already postponed from last Friday, are now scheduled for Tuesday, weather permitting, according to Charleston County athletic director Dave Spurlock. Spurlock said teams can play two games in one week, but he is suggesting that Friday’s regularly scheduled games be moved to Saturday. “I don’t know how many of our schools will decide to do that, but that’s my suggestion,” Spurlock said. Berkeley and Dorchester county schools also are closed Monday, putting off their games for at least another day, as well.
