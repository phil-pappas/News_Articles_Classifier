Now it’s a matter of adding to a four-game winning streak when Wake Forest visits Saturday night. “We think we got a lot of accomplished,” Tar Heels coach Larry Fedora said Monday. “We got some things tweaked. … adjusting some things. Maybe we’ve tinkered with some things scheme-wise.” North Carolina (4-1 overall, 1-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) announced the loss of two role players because of health-related issues, but otherwise Fedora said it was a good week for players to heal from the strain of the first month-plus of the season. The Tar Heels said they weren’t concerned about losing momentum that had been building, particularly with their most-recent outing resulting in a comeback victory at Georgia Tech. “It was a good week for us,” Tar Heels linebacker Jeff Schoettmer said. “It wasn’t a wasted bye week.” Freshman defensive tackle Aaron Crawford will have season-ending surgery to repair a broken foot suffered during practice last week. He played in two games, recording two tackles. The school will apply for a medical redshirt for Crawford. Redshirt freshman tight end Caleb Samuels career is done because of continuing concerns related to a heart condition. He played in all five games this season, scoring on a two-point conversion catch following the game’s first touchdown against North Carolina A&T. Wake Forest is 3-3, 1-2.
