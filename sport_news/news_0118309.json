Vipers quarterback Alex Fernandes passed for 352 yards and six TDs, meanwhile, to help his team rally from a 28-point first-half deficit.\nRalph Barrera Vandegrift running back Travis Brannan celebrates a second-quarter touchdown run against Vista Ridge with his teammates. The Vipers overcame a 28-point deficit to record a 63-55 victory. For Vandegrift — ranked No. 4 in the state in Class 5A — the outcome avenged a 56-52 double-overtime loss to Vista Ridge last season.\n“This is a special team,” Fernandes said. “We can go the distance.”\nThe play of Brannan, Fernandes and Vipers receiver Paxton Segina, who caught touchdown passes of 24, 46, 75 and 48 yards, overshadowed a one-man show by Vista Ridge’s Matthew Snow. The Rangers’ senior quarterback accounted for for seven touchdowns in the first half — five rushing, two passing. He finished the game with 217 yards rushing and 192 yards passing.\nRalph Barrera Vista Ridge quarterback Matt Snow scrambles for yardage Friday night on a second-quarter carry. Snow accounted for seven first-half touchdowns — five rushing and two passing — but the Rangers couldn’t hold their lead and suffered a 63-55 loss to Vandegrift in a District 25-5A showdown. Vandegrift (6-0, 3-0 in District 25-5A) hardly looked like a state-ranked squad while falling behind 42-14 in the first half.\nVipers coach Drew Sanders said he learned a lot about his players’ resilience, though, in the second half.\n“We made some adjustments at halftime and started to play a little bit,” Sanders said. “We finally started to play a little bit.\n“We knew our offense could get going, but our defense made the big difference by holding them to two field goals in the second half.”\nAcross the field, Vista Ridge coach Rodney Vincent said the game turned late in the second quarter. Leading 49-28, the Rangers yielded Segina’s 75-yard touchdown reception, a score that cut the margin to 14 points at the break.\n“That took a lot of our momentum away,” Vincent said.\nSanders agreed with Vincent’s assessment.\n“We got the ball first in the second half, and we would score then, too,” he said.\nFernandes fired a pair of touchdown passes in the third quarter. Sean Dehne caught the first — a 30-yarder — and Culver Sumner hauled in an 18-yard touchdown reception near the end of the period to tie the score at 49 after three quarters.\nSegina gave the Vipers their first lead, scoring on a 48-yard pass from Fernandes to start the fourth quarter.\nGiven the lead, the Vipers gave the football to Brannan, who punished Rangers defenders while rushing for 160 yards after halftime.\n“Paxton Segina made some really big plays, and then we saw the light in the second half,” Brannan said. “We believed. And then we came out and played our brand of football in the second half.”\nRanked 10th in Class 5A, Vista Ridge (5-1, 2-1) sputtered offensively in the second half, recording just two field goals by Diogo Chiaramonte.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/10/0f/12/rbz-Vista-Ridge-v-Vandegrift-16.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/10/36/6b/rbz-Vista-Ridge-v-Vandegrift-22.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T08:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:59:15.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
