Those loyal enough to say goodbye in person to a 76-86 team on a chilly, dreary Bears Sunday at U.S. Cellular Field were treated to a 6-0 loss to the last-place Detroit Tigers.\nAppropriately, a Sox team that finished last in the American League in runs was shut out for the 12 th time and held to three or less for the 83 rd time in their eighth loss in the last 12 games to cap a third consecutive losing season, ninth in the last 10 years and seventh in a row without a playoff appearance.\n“Very disappointing. Absolutely,’’ manager Robin Ventura said.\nThat was the universal feeling among the 19,800 paid fans in the seats and in the Sox clubhouse, not only Sunday but for most of the season that went off the rails early and never got back on after an 8-14 start.\nThe Sox finished in fourth place in the American League Central, a half game ahead of the last-place Tigers who threw up a white flag at the trade deadline when the Sox, enjoying their only hot streak of the season, held on to free-agent to be Jeff Samardzija believing a wild card berth was a possibility.\nIt wasn’t to be. The Sox finished 19 games behind the first place Kansas City Royals and 10 games out of a wild card berth.\nPlayers, before packing bags and boxes and exchanging well-wishing goodbye hugs, expressed the usual “this is on us, not our manager” sentiments most losing teams have, defending Ventura and putting the blame on themselves.\n“We are going to definitely reflect on what I can do better as an individual and we can do better as a team and hopefully fix a lot of things between now and April or whatever it is in our first game next year,’’ center fielder Adam Eaton said.\n“We’re getting scrutinized, the whole team up and down — and Robin and everybody, we’re doing our darnedest to put a good product out there and it hurts. And no one feels worse than the guys in this clubhouse. We know the city of Chicago and the fans deserve better. When we can’t produce it tears us up, trust me.’’\nVentura, encouraged by what he viewed as improved play defensively as the season went along, said he expects better next year just off what he saw in the second half, when, in his view the team played cleaner defensively.\nEaton, Melky Cabrera and Alexei Ramirez all got off to poor starts, and Adam LaRoche’s poor start extended all the way to the finish line.\nRoster changes will be made, upgrades will be sought and continued improvements hoped for from youngsters Carlos Rodon, Trayce Thompson, Tyler Saladino and Carlos Sanchez.\n“Even if you go with the guys that are here, we’re better off now than we were at the beginning of the year as far as playing the game,’’ Ventura said. “Hopefully those slow starts aren’t repeated.’’\nRegulars Eaton (.286, 14 homers, 56 RBI, 98 runs), Jose Abreu (.290, 30 homers, 101 RBI), Cabrera (.273, 12 homers, 77 RBI) and Tyler Flowers (.239, nine homers, 39 RBI) all sat out Sunday as Ventura played – in possible peaks at 2016 — Trayce Thompson in center field and Saladino at shortstop.\nNorris (3-2, 3.75) gave up one hit in five innings, a triple to Thompson who did not score because designated hitter Alexei Ramirez, in possibly his last game as a Sox, tapped an off-speed pitch to Norris for a double play. Saladino doubled in the sixth and Avisail Garcia singled in the ninth, and that was that for the popgun Sox offense that finished with 136 homers – last in the AL — playing in a hitter’s park.\nFor the Sox, in power numbers and beyond, all they can do is move up. And that’s the sad reality of 2015.\nFollow me on Twitter @CST_soxvan.\nEmail: dvanschouwen@suntimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:59:21.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
