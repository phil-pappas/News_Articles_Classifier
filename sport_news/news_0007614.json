Its first win over a ranked opponent since 1996 ended with fans rushing the field, university administrators exchanging hugs and high-fives and tight end Alan Cross directing the band. The Tigers (6-0) are bowl-eligible. On Sunday, they were voted No. 18 in The Associated Press' Top 25 and No. 17 in the Amway Coaches Poll.\nNow, their challenge is not merely to get ready for Tulsa; it's to put all of the hoopla behind them.\n\"We've just got to keep our heads on straight,\" Cross said. \"Get the young guys to realize that hey, this is an important game coming up because it's a conference game. It's a quick turnaround, so we've got to get ready.\"\nMemphis has won 13 consecutive games spanning more than a calendar year, and as they've continued to win, the fanfare has grown. For much of the past month, players have dealt with the weight of expectations and heightened excitement around campus. Their past three games have been on national television.\nThe attention surrounding Memphis football will increase this week and beyond, but it will not be new. That's why quarterback Paxton Lynch, who will be under the strongest spotlight, believes this group can handle it.\n\"I think any team that we have under coach Fuente can handle that,\" Lynch said. \"(Fuente) does a great job of telling those younger guys, and especially the older guys, talking to (them) about all the distractions. We were playing hard when there were no distractions, and when the distractions are here, we've just got to keep doing the same thing. Put our heads down, and keep working.\"\nAfter winning three games in two seasons under Larry Porter, the football program had reached bottom. In the first two seasons under Fuente, there was improvement but no more than four wins in a season. The Tigers began to adopt an underdog mentality.\n\"We like being the underdog, because it makes us feel better,\" Cross said. \"It puts pressure on the other team.\"\nBut what happens now that Memphis will be favored instead of overlooked?\n\"We're still going to treat it like we are the underdog,\" Cross continued. \"It's conference (games) coming up. Conference games, six games straight. We've got Tulsa and Navy and Temple and Houston and SMU â€” all those guys are capable of winning every ballgame the rest of the season.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:22:09.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
