Bjerregaard twice nosed in front at the par-70 Fanling Course before settling for shared honors. \nRose completed another bogey-free round - he has made only one bogey all week - and finished with a solid 6-under 64, which included two eagles and two birdies. \n''It was really a fun day playing with Lucas and flip-flopping birdies and eagles and stretching away from the rest of the field,'' said Rose, who had monster putts of 25 and 50 feet on Nos. 3 and 13 respectively for eagles. \nBjerregaard rolled in eight birdies to card 63, the best round of the day, and only a bogey at his final hole prevented him enjoying the sole lead going into the final round. \nEuropean Tour rookie Anirban Lahiri of India shot 65 to move to 11-under 199 and grab second place. India's Jeev Milka Singh (65) and England's Matt Fitzpatrick (66) were next on 10-under 200. \nIan Poulter started two shots behind leader Rose but carded a disappointing 3-over 73 to finish 11 shots off the pace. \nPoulter had made a frantic dash to make it to the Hong Kong Open and was only able to play because American Rich Beem had given up his spot so that the Ryder Cup star could meet the requirements of keeping his European Tour membership. \n''The tank was empty and I'm really gutted,'' Poulter said. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T14:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:18:31.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
