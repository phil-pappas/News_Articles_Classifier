Willie Reed, trying to make an NBA roster for the first time, also missed practice with a right quad strain. \nNone of the injuries is expected to be a long-term issue. The team said Wednesday only Bogdanovic would not make it to Detroit for tonight’s preseason game. \nBut the situation is less than ideal, especially for a young Brooklyn team that’s trying to build familiarity and chemistry. \n\"Those are guys that are going to be on the team,\" forward Thaddeus Young said. \"Guys we’re going to have to focus [on building] with. And yeah, it is kind of difficult. … That’s the biggest part is having that team structure, that team cohesiveness where we can go out there and work together on the court each and every day.\" \nThe Nets haven’t had those chances over the last two practices, because everyone listed on Wednesday’s injury report missed both workouts. \nRobinson, for example, had the valuable opportunity to play alongside Young and Brook Lopez in Monday’s exhibition, but he missed the chance to build on it in the gym. \nPart of this is unavoidable. It’s the preseason, and if players are banged up, it doesn’t make sense to play and prepare them for games that don’t count. \n\"I don’t want to catch a hangnail right now if I can help it,\" Robinson said. \"But it’s preseason, and I’m only sore. There’s no broken bones or nothing, so it feels good to just take this time right now. Just a couple days, so it’s not really an issue.\" \nNow the Nets must hope today’s nagging injuries don’t have long-term consequences as they try to grow together. \n\"It hurts continuity,\" coach Lionel Hollins said. \"But it is what it is. Nicks and banged-up bruises, you’ve got to deal with it. Just the guys who are out here, [you] keep going forward. And the guys, when they come back, have got to catch up to speed.\" \nBRIEF: GM Billy King gave an update on the plans for rookie Chris McCullough, who is recovering from a torn ACL he suffered in January at Syracuse. King said \"the goal is for him to be on the court this season.\" There was no clarification if it’s a practice court or a game court. A Nets spokesman said there will be \"no further updates\" on McCullough’s status.
