He was an assistant with the Blue Devils on their back-to-back National Championship teams in 1991-92. Bilas is a practicing attorney who is more recognized for his work on ESPN. \nSo when it comes to issues concerning the NCAA and the athletes who play college sports, Bilas isn't a lip-flapper trying to get a reaction or someone tossing out click bait. He is very opinionated on things that happen away from the basketball court. \n\"I would probably be better if I just kept my mouth shut and just talked about who the good teams were, who the best players and best coaches were,\" Bilas told me. \"I can't do that.\" \nWhy does Bilas find it so hard to remain silent on how the business of college athletics is operated led by the NCAA? \n\"I have a difference of opinion on policy,\" he clarified. \"The people within in the NCAA structure are great. I have no qualm with the NCAA president personally, any person within the NCAA office in Indianapolis. They are unbelievably good people who are well intentioned. We just differ on policy. As long as I keep this issue to policy only and don't make it personal and don't make it about people that are making the decisions, I think it's an important topic to tackle.\" \nBilas believes there is a great unbalance between the amount of money generated by college sports and where that money goes. \n\"We've got billions of dollars running through here and we can't pretend it's not there,\" he said. \"The players aren't mistreated but they are exploited.\" \nIf it was up to Bilas, the players who help bring in the major money would be paid in accordance. But there shouldn't be a limit on how much a high profile could earn. \n\"My argument would be why is it limited to $7,500 or $5,000? Whatever the limit is,\" he said. \"Why are athletes alone limited when no coach, no administrator, no student is?\" \nCost of attendance entered the game this year where athletes on scholarship earn a yearly payment above the value of their scholarship. The amount varies from school to school. \n\"I think these arguments about differences in cost of attendance are kind of middle school arguments. It's kind of like saying, 'Mom, his cookie is bigger. That's not fair,'\" Bilas mocked \"'He got two scoops of ice cream and I only got one. That's not fair!'\" \nCatch more of my interview with Jay Bilas this Sunday morning at 11:30 on WRAL Sports Sunday. \nCopyright 2015 by Capitol Broadcasting Company. All rights reserved.
