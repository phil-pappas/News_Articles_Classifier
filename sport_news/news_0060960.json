Updating an earlier report , Tyrod Taylor is likely going to be on the shelf for multiple weeks as he recovers from an MCL sprain suffered on Sunday when he was brought down hard via horse collar, per Jason La Canfora of CBS Sports.\nAdChoices Tyrod Taylor could miss multiple games with an MCL sprain suffered on a horse-collar tackle Sun. Bills will prepare EJ Manuel to start Sun..\n— Jason La Canfora (@JasonLaCanfora) October 13, 2015 This means EJ Manuel will be the team’s starter going forward until Taylor returns to action. It’s quite a blow to a team that has rallied behind Taylor. Rex Ryan called the quarterback “ tough and courageous ” after he won the game with two second-half scoring drives, despite dealing with the painful injury.\nThe Bills have a tough task ahead of them as the undefeated Cincinnati Bengals come into town in Week 6. Week 7 will be a road game in Jacksonville, and the team will thankfully have a bye in Week 8. Perhaps by that time Taylor will be able to make his return.\nThe Bills have the potential to be a strong playoff team, but the pressure is on Manuel now to perform well and keep the team above .500 heading into Week 8 when the Miami Dolphins come to Buffalo.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://sportsnaut.com/2015/10/report-ej-manuel-could-start-sunday-for-tyrod-taylor-ankle-bills-sign-josh-johnson/", "http://www.buffalobills.com/video/videos/Rex-Ryan-Taylor-tough-and-courageous/d95e94a1-b0cc-4879-9bb4-3b1d62d6f3cb", "https://twitter.com/JasonLaCanfora/status/653997536882073600", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:46:03.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
