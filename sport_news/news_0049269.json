Not to worry though. He’s got the ageless Matt Hasselbeck to fill in. Andre Johnson caught two touchdown passes from the 40-year-old Hasselbeck, the second for 2 yards in the fourth quarter, to help the Colts beat the Houston Texans 27-20 on Thursday night. “Got the best backup in the league right now,” Pagano said. “We could argue that.” Released by Houston in March after 12 seasons with the team, Johnson had six catches for 77 yards. Hasselbeck won his second straight game filling in for Luck, who was out with a shoulder injury. Hasselbeck’s performance was even more impressive given the fact that he was battling a bacterial infection that hospitalized him this week. He started feeling ill just before halftime Sunday in a victory over Jacksonville and didn’t start feeling better until Thursday night. “I honestly feel like this isn’t even real right now,” Hasselbeck said. Pagano raved about Hasselbeck. “He was literally on his deathbed Monday/Tuesday and mustered up enough to come in Wednesday and practice,” Pagano said. “He was getting IVs and fighting a virus and the grittiest performance I’ve seen in a long, long time.” Brian Hoyer, who replaced Ryan Mallett for Houston (1-4) in the second quarter, threw a pass up for grabs that was intercepted by Mike Adams with less than 2 minutes left to help the Colts (3-2) seal the victory. Some things to know about the Colts’ win over the Texans. QUARTERBACK CAROUSEL: Mallett got the wind knocked out of him on an illegal hit midway through the second quarter and was replaced by Hoyer. Mallett was OK soon after that, but coach Bill O’Brien stuck with Hoyer, who finished with 312 yards passing with two touchdowns. Hoyer won the starting job out of camp but was benched after Week 1. He came in late in last week’s loss Atlanta, but O’Brien started Mallett again on Thursday. After the game he wouldn’t say who will direct the offense going forward. “We’ll review (the film) tomorrow and see where we are at that position,” O’Brien said.
