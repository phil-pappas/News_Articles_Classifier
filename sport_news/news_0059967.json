Binghamton’s power-play unit opened the scoring 9:48 into the first period when Colin Greening redirected a shot from Patrick Mullen past Albany ’s Yann Danis. The Devils tied the game 1-1 with just over six minutes to play on the power play when Joseph Blandisi managed to poke home a loose puck under Driedger’s right pad. The teams skated the majority of the second period tied 1-1 before O’Dell notched his first of the game with less than 1:30 to play in the frame. Tobias Lindberg skated up ice with O’Dell in a two-on-one rush against Danis and dished a cross-crease feed to O’Dell who one-timed it into the back of the net to give Binghamton the 2-1 lead heading into the final break. David Dziurzynski increased the B-Sens lead to 3-1 just 3:40 into the third period when he took a feed from Mike Kostka behind the net and beat Danis clean over his glove hand for his first marker of the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:55:33.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
