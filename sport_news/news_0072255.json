That's why we're really positive about it,\" Lucas told Liverpool's website. \n''If you look at our position in the table, it's not great. But we are not many points behind the top four and even the top. We still have the cups and the Europa League. \n''It's still early days in the season and we have a lot to play for. Hopefully, we'll start very well under him and at the end of the season it'll be a successful season for us.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T09:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:08:04.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
