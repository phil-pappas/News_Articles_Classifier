SC said it will decide her petition and till then let her continue as a short service commission officer.\nMadhumita while posted in Afghanistan in 2010 had braved the odds during a terrorist strike to rescue many of her injured colleagues and send them to hospital.\nArmy through its counsel told the court that if she was allowed to wriggle out of her earlier decision not to opt for permanent commission, which was acted upon by the authorities, then it would encourage others to make similar requests just before their short service commission engagement coming to an end creating difficulties for the Army.
