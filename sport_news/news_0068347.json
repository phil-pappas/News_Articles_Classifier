(AP Photo/Ben Margot) « » Related Media OAKLAND, Calif. — Charles Woodson and the Oakland defense kept putting the team in position to win only to see mistakes on offense and special teams do in the Raiders. Chris Harris Jr. returned a fourth-quarter interception by Derek Carr 74 yards for a touchdown and Sebastian Janikowski missed two field goals to send the Raiders to a 16-10 loss to Denver on Sunday despite keeping Peyton Manning and the Broncos out of the end zone. “It’s hard. It’s really hard because we feel like we left something on the field,” Carr said. “We feel like we’ve left wins out there.” One week after losing on a last-minute field goal in Chicago, the Raiders (2-3) were in position to take the lead against Denver (5-0) twice in the fourth quarter. Woodson’s second interception set up a 40-yard field goal try that Janikowski missed on the first play of the fourth quarter. After the defense forced a punt, Carr drove the Raiders to the Broncos 31 where they were in position for another field goal to erase a 9-7 deficit. Instead, the Broncos blitzed and Carr’s short pass over the middle to Seth Roberts was off target. Harris intercepted it and returned it for the touchdown. “We had pressure and I threw the hot and it just didn’t work out our way,” Carr said. Carr threw for 249 yards and a 3-yard TD pass to Marcel Reece, but the Raiders lost their eighth straight to the Broncos. Those mistakes overshadowed a splendid day from Woodson, who turned 39 on Wednesday and became the oldest player ever to record two interceptions in a game on Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:09:06.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
