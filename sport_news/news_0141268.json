Sainz, 21, ran into the barriers at 93 miles per hour. He missed the qualifying session Saturday afternoon, but after tests in the hospital, he was deemed fit to take part in the race, starting from the last position. He climbed as high as seventh, but then his rear wing fell off and he retired on Lap 47 of the 53-lap race. Two laps later, a track marshal ran out onto the track to grab the wing, and narrowly escaped being struck by Vettel’s Ferrari. “O.K., it’s clear that we have a very brave Russian running across the track,” Vettel said by radio to his team. A first lap accident involving a collision that left two cars sitting in the middle of the track drew out the safety car to suspend the race while the mess was cleaned up. On lap 12, there was a massive accident by Romain Grosjean, in a Lotus, who ran into the barriers and spun around violently. There was very little left of his car. That brought out the safety car for the second time as Grosjean got out of the car, stunned, and track marshals cleaned up the debris and the wreck of what remained of his Lotus. “I lost the rear end in a very high speed corner going through turn 3 and couldn’t recover it,” said Grosjean. “I feel O.K. physically and I’ll certainly be a bit sore tomorrow morning, but I’ll be completely fine again after a couple of days.” Part of the reason the accidents were so spectacular had to do with the Tecpro safety barriers themselves. The barriers are made of three layers of interconnected blocks of shock-absorbing plastic-like material. But the cars can get caught up in them and then be tangled and torn apart, with wheels and suspension ripping off in the rapid deceleration. In Sainz’s accident the Spanish driver first hit a concrete wall before barreling straight down the track into the Tecpro barriers, which engulfed the car as they absorbed the impact of the crash. “It was shocking to see that he was so deep in the barrier and that he was covered in the barrier,” Vettel said after Sainz’s crash. Unlike most Formula One tracks, the circuit in Sochi runs through a tight area of buildings with very little or no run-off area, and the whole track is lined by barriers, similar to the way the track is set up for the Monaco Grand Prix, run on the streets of the city. The race had been predicted to be another walkover for both Mercedes cars, which finished first and second last year, but after only six laps, Rosberg lost his throttle and handed the lead to his teammate. “It’s not nice when there is a problem with the throttle, I had to take my complete leg off the throttle, and then I couldn’t steer anymore,” Rosberg said. With just four races left, Hamilton leads the series with 302 points, over Vettel, who is in second with 236 and Rosberg now in third with 229. A victory awards 25 points.
