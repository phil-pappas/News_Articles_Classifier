It shouldn’t be done.\"\nDyson had a forgettable outing. He relieved Cole Hamels and tried to protect a 3-2 Texas lead. Instead, he allowed the tying run to score on a fielder's choice, and then he gave up the 3-run jack to Bautista, which was the game-winning shot.\nDyson was so upset about giving up the game that he picked a fight with Edwin Encarnacion and then later started something with Troy Tulowitzki .\nBautista said after the game that he reacted in the heat of the moment with his passionate bat flip. He also said he meant no disrespect by it.\n\"It's just the whole game. It's a great game, it's do-or-die game on a tight series. Winner obviously advances. I don't mean any disrespect whenever I do anything like that, and I certainly didn't plan it,\" Bautista said in an interview with FS1's Ken Rosenthal. \"It was just a moment, and I felt it and I did it. I was just glad that I was able to help out the team in that moment.\"\nBautista was asked if he had a response for Dyson's comment and gave a one-word answer: no.\nBautista's bat flip was the most talked about play of the game and will be remembered for ages. It's the kind of play and reaction that will get fans and the youth excited about baseball. And if Dyson is upset about that, well then next time he shouldn't leave a pitch up in the zone, and he wouldn't have to worry about being the goat.\n© Dan Hamilton-USA TODAY Sports Oct 14, 2015; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Toronto Blue Jays right fielder Jose Bautista (19) reacts after hitting a three run home run during the seventh inning against the Texas Rangers in game five of the ALDS at Rogers Centre.
