(Josh Galemore/Savannah Morning News via AP)\nSTATESBORO, Ga. — The Georgia Southern Eagles started with a rush and never really let up in Saturday’s 56-26 football victory over visiting New Mexico State.\nMatt Breida ran for 137 yards and touchdown on 13 carries, quarterback Kevin Ellison added a 67-yard TD sprint, and Georgia State (5-1, 3-0 Sun Belt Conference) amassed 507 rushing yards on 59 carries.\nThe Eagles took control with four lengthy touchdown runs in the first half, building a 28-0 lead on L.A. Ramsby’s 23-yard rush with 2:46 left in the first half.\nNew Mexico State (0-6, 0-2) got three touchdown passes from quarterback Andrew Allen, who made his first start of the season in place of injured Tyler Rogers. Allen finished 20-of-37 passing for 253 yards and threw one interception.\nAllen moved the offense reasonably well over the final three quarters but the Aggies never got closer than a 21-point deficit after their sluggish start. NMSU lost its 16th consecutive game dating back to last season, the longest active skid among FBS teams.\nGeorgia Southern was coming off a bye week and won its fifth straight game by an impressive margin. It has averaged 48.2 points per game during that span.\nThe Eagles’ triple-option attack also came in leading the nation in rushing at 377.4 yards per game and significantly increased its average.\nWesley Fields also pulled in a 60-yard scoring pass from Ellison as Georgia Southern led by as many as 44 points in the fourth quarter. It was the first passing touchdown for the Eagles in more than a year. They passed for just 85 yards Saturday but did not need to go to the air often.\nEllison became the sixth Georgia Southern player to exceed 2,000 career yards rushing and passing.\nFor NMSU, Larry Rose III rushed 13 times for 82 yards and caught five passes for 31 more. Manzano High School graduate Joshua Bowen caught two short touchdown passes for the Aggies, and Jordan Bergstrom caught three passes for 46 yards and a TD.\nThe Aggies’ final points came on a 74-yard fumble return by lineback Will Clement with 6:43 left in the game.\nThree linebackers were ejected for targeting: Eagles Deshawntee “Ironhead” Gallon and William Bussey and Aggie Terrill Hanks.\nBox score: Georgia Southern 56, New Mexico State 26", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GS-vs-NMSU.pdf", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/New-Mexico-State-Georgia-Southern-Football-640x431.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T05:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:18:00.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
