Daniel Gallen Contact Reporter \nAfter its move to the Big Ten Conference, Maryland gets the opportunity to play in some of the most venerable venues in college football: The Big House in Ann Arbor, Mich.; The Horseshoe in Columbus, Ohio; Beaver Stadium in Happy Valley. The massive crowds and history add another dimension to the contests. \nAgainst Penn State on Saturday, the Terps had the opportunity to play in a different kind of stadium but still on a significant stage at M&T Bank Stadium, home of the Baltimore Ravens. The announced crowd of 68,948 was largely split between Terps and Nittany Lions supporters, with both teams getting a home field advantage at different points. \n“I thought it was a great crowd — the ebb and flow of the game, both sides, fans being heavily involved,” interim coach Mike Locksley said. “I enjoyed coming up here. I know our team does. We’ve got a passionate Baltimore fan base that we need to continue to come up and try to facilitate them to be a part of our program and we’ll continue to do as much as we can. I really enjoyed the atmosphere.” \nEntering the game, the Terps were excited for the opportunity to play in a pro stadium . For some, it was their first time playing at one. And they knew that playing in Baltimore, where some of them hail from, was important. \n“This is home,” defensive end Yannick Ngakoue said. “It was great to play in an NFL stadium. It was a great atmosphere. Penn State fans, Maryland fans, it was very fun.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:05:20.939+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
