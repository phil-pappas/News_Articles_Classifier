Key came in relief of starter Nick Stevens after just two offensive series. ( Trevor L Davis / Loveland Reporter-Herald ) \nFORT COLLINS â€” From the ever-thinning crowd came a haunting, ominous tune instantly familiar to anyone who owns a television set. \nColorado State's band sent a blaring rendition of \"The Walking Dead\" theme song into the crisp night air around Hughes Stadium, intended as commentary on CSU's opposition while on offense, but it felt much more appropriate for the home side Saturday, and increasingly, its season. \nThe Rams stumbled around the field like an aimless walker hoping for anything to fall into their grasp and Boise State simply shoved them aside. The game was still going, but the Rams were lifeless bystanders in a 41-10 blowout loss. \nQuestions swarm around Colorado State like buzzards these days as the Rams continue to struggle in the same areas week after week, with each mounting loss wearing on the new coaching staff's good will. \nNear the top rests an uncertainty at the quarterback position, with both starter Nick Stevens and backup Coleman Key seeing the field in chunks throughout CSU's first six games of the season. \nStevens exited camp as head coach Mike Bobo's clear choice for the job, but has been less than dedicated to the sophomore incumbent multiple times this year, the latest against Boise State. \nBobo pulled Stevens following only two series at the start of the contest, both unsuccessful three and outs, but with no glaring mistakes from his starter with the exception of taking a sack to end the second drive. It was all apart of the plan, well, sort of. \n\"We were going to play (Key) on the third series going into the game. Then he had a little momentum there. We didn't complete but one pass to (Joe) Hansley, but he had a couple of scrambles, and I thought there was some momentum, so I decided to keep him in th game,\" Bobo explained after the game. \"Then we really didn't execute from that point on offensively, expect a short drive on a short field to get a field goal. We had some opportunities that we missed, and went back to Nick just because of execution.\" \nStevens would later come in near the end of the third quarter following Key's struggles. He found limited success, with the game well out of reach by that point. \n\"You just have to understand what (the coaches) are trying to do as an offense. We're trying to get a spark going and we came out kinda dead on offense, so they put (Key in),\" Stevens said. \"He had kind of a spark, but we had another lull toward the end of the game, so they put me in and we moved the ball a little bit, but we weren't able to finish. \n\"I think the biggest thing that me and Coleman need to realize is we're on the same team and we're rooting for each other when we're in there. I wasn't complaining about it on the sideline; I was hoping for him to do well. He threw that touchdown and did a good job leading the team. Boise's just a tough team to beat.\" Boise State linebacker Tyler Gray (36) wrangles Colorado State quarterback Nick Stevens to the ground for a sack Saturday at Hughes Stadium. Stevens split time with backup Coleman Key in the Rams' 41-10 loss. ( Trevor L Davis / Loveland Reporter-Herald ) \nIt was a shorter hook than Bobo has displayed at other times in the year, most notably when he plugged Key in relief against Minnesota on Sept. 12, the second week of the season, looking for a spark. The sophomore appeared several times this year by Bobo's design, yet this had a decidedly different feel. \nKey's chance to seize the job for his own outright was set up perfectly. However, the freshman was underwhelming over the better part of the first three quarters. Key completed just 5 of 19 attempts (26.3 percent) for 56 yards with a touchdown and a pair of interceptions to garner a quarterback rating of 47.4. \nWhile the assets Key brings to a football field like arm strength and a higher level of athleticism were apparent at times, he also proved why Bobo has stuck with Stevens as his starter in the first six weeks. \n\"We're just trying to do what it takes to win, whether it's me or Nick, we're trying to put the person in there who's going to be productive and provide a spark for our offense,\" Key said. \"I felt like I provided a spark early, but I just got to be more consistent.\" \nKey showed his inexperience several instances by forcing throws downfield, often into coverage, where both his turnovers occurred. He was responsible for the Rams' lone touchdown-scoring possession with a 13-yard toss to Hansley 4 seconds into the second quarter, and scrambled 14 yards for a first down earlier in the drive. \nIt was rough sailing from that point on as both Key's interceptions followed with a stagnant offense the rest of the night, outside of a late-half drive that ended in a 20-yard field goal. \n\"I think it's a little bit of hesitation with throwing the ball. We had guys that were open tonight and we were almost trying to aim the ball instead of throw the ball,\" Bobo evaluated. \"The ball's sailing high. We're kind of hoping they're complete. You've got to trust what you see and you've got to cut the ball loose. That's on me, and we've got to do a better job of making sure they understand what they see and they can go out and execute it.\" \nKey was pulled with minutes left in the third quarter, giving way once more to Stevens, who finished 8-for-10 for 60 yards with no turnovers. Both said they didn't know who would be the starter come Monday. Only Bobo knows. \n\"We're going to have to meet, watch the film on Sunday and decide what direction, what we're going to do, how we're going to move the ball offensively,\" he said. \"We've got to look at a lot of things offensively. \n\"I'm just talking about offense and how we can move the ball, how we can generate explosive plays. It's hard to go down the field three yards, two yards, four yards. Going for it on two fourth downs. We've got to get some explosive plays and find a way to get it in our explosive player's hands.\" \nAs for the two quarterbacks, there's little doubt what needs to be done on their end. It's time to take the decision out of the coach's hands. \n\"I think we just need to play with more consistency at the quarterback position,\" Stevens said. \"We need to have good games. I think in practice we both do a pretty good job competing and leading the team that we're going with. We just need to carry that over in the games.\" \nCris Tiller: 970-669-5050 ext. 511, tillerc@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/cristiller", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:08:52.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
