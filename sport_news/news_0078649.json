Bulgaria was eliminated with eight points, Azerbaijan has six and Malta two. \nCroatia beat Bulgaria 3-0 with goals from Ivan Perisic, Ivan Rakitic and Nikola Kalinic. The match was played in an empty stadium in Zagreb as part of the punishment for a swastika that was painted on the pitch before a match against Italy in June. \nCroatia was also deducted a point for the swastika incident. \nCroatia's Duje Cop was shown a red card in the final minutes for a hard tackle. \nThe top two finishers from the nine groups qualify automatically. The best third-place finisher also qualifies automatically, while the eight other third-place teams can reach the tournament through a playoff. \nNorway is guaranteed at least a playoff spot, although Croatia holds the tiebreaker with a better head-to-head record. \nItaly can secure first place against Norway in Rome on Tuesday, while Croatia visits Malta. \nStill, winning the group might not be enough for Italy to get a top seed in the Euro 2016 draw. \n\"Croatia is ahead of us in the FIFA rankings but we're ahead in the UEFA rankings,\" Conte said. \"These are mechanisms that I have a hard time understanding.\" \nThe Azzurri are under pressure to perform after getting eliminated from the group stage at the last two World Cups. Since winning the 2006 World Cup, Italy's only highlight was reaching the final of Euro 2012. \nOn a rainy evening in Baku, Azerbaijan played its first match in the new Olimpiya stadium, while Italy had to overcome the absence of injured playmaker Andrea Pirlo. \nEleven minutes in, Pirlo's replacement Marco Verratti launched a long, vertical pass for Eder that gave the Brazilian-born forward plenty of room to glide past the defense and easily beat goalkeeper Kamran Agayev. \nIt was Eder's second goal in five matches for Italy. He also has six goals in seven Serie A matches this season for Sampdoria. \nMinutes later, Eder turned provider for Graziano Pelle, who shot on target and had Agayev tip his effort over the bar. \nJust after the half-hour mark, a defensive lapse allowed Nazarov to score from the edge of the area, with Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci sharing the blame. \nEl Shaarawy restored Italy's lead by redirecting a cross from Antonio Candreva into an empty net on a play that began with Pelle. \nThe son of an Egyptian father and an Italian mother, the 22-year-old El Shaarawy has been hailed as one of Italy's best young players for years but he struggled with injuries and confidence in recent seasons. After failing to make Italy's squad for last year's World Cup, El Shaarawy transferred from AC Milan to Monaco. \nIn the 61st, a lob effort from an outstanding Eder was cleared off the line by Azerbaijan captain Rashad Sadygov, who was celebrating his 100th national team appearance. \nFour minutes later, Darmian got his first goal for Italy with a long, powerful effort after taking a loose ball beyond the area. \nAzerbaijan defender Badavi Huseynov was shown a direct red card for a last-man foul on substitute Sebastian Giovinco in the 88th and Giovinco's ensuing free kick hit the crossbar. \nAndrew Dampf can be followed at http://www.twitter.com/asdampf \nAll content copyright Â©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T23:54:25.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
