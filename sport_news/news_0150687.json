He also designed the courses for the last two Olympics in Beijing and London. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:15:47.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
