Though several BJP leaders were called to Delhi, including constant “hate mongers” BJP MP Sakshi Majharaj and MLA Sangeet Som, Shah chose to speak to Khattar in private for five minutes at the party office where he reportedly told the Haryana Chief Minister that his comment asking Muslims to stop eating beef if they wanted to stay in India “were not necessary at a time when the party was trying to consolidate Muslim votes in Bihar”. It may be recalled that Khattar in an interview to a national daily had said that the Muslims will have to quit eating beef if they wanted to stay in India. Party sources told The Tribune Shah candidly told Khattar that Modi was very upset with the comment, especially since it came at a time when the party was ‘slugging it out” in Bihar. “Firstly the comment was ill-timed and secondly, there was no need to contradict it when the interview was recorded”, Shah is believed to have told Khattar, adding that this had harmed the party’s image in Bihar. After Khattar denied making any such remarks, the publication released Khattar’s audio recording, embarrassing the BJP. Warned against making any such comments in future, Shah is believed to have told Khattar that in future he must take prior approval from the party. The beef issue has derailed the BJP development agenda, Shah is believed to have told Khattar. It all started last evening when Khattar’s phone rang. His personal assistant who took the call passed on the phone to the Chief Minister, who was in a function at a Panipat School. Khattar immediately went inside a room and came out after five minutes smiling to suggest nothing was amiss. After participating in four functions at Panipat after the call, when the CM’s convoy turned towards the Panipat refinery, where he was to stay for the night, Khattar asked the driver to move towards Delhi. After the meeting with the BJP President this morning, Khattar came back to Panipat and continued with his scheduled programmes for the day that included the inauguration of a sugar mill and a bridge. The Chief Minister later met some RSS leaders and apprised them about his meeting with the BJP President. Officials close to the Chief Minister dismissed the reports about Khattar being pulled up saying that “Khattar had sought time from the BJP President to discuss the programmes connected to the BJP completing one year in office. As Shah gave the CM an appointment for this morning, the CM rushed to meet the BJP President”. Sources in Delhi, however, rubbished this explanation, saying that those summoned and warned in person or over the phone today for making statements against Muslims included Khattar, Union Minister Mahesh Sharma and Sanjeev Balyan, MP Sakshi Maharaj and MLA Sangeet Som.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:14:04.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
