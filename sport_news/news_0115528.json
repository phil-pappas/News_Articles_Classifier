Google's offerings complement the search services provided by Microsoft , which remains a partner, as well as Yahoo's own search technologies and ad products such as Yahoo Gemini . \nAccording to Yahoo , the agreement with Google provides Yahoo with \"additional flexibility to choose among suppliers of search results and ads\". During the third quarter, Yahoo unveiled a new custom audience feature for its Gemini ad platform and introduced Yahoo News Live, a daily news stream which features Katie Couric. \nDigital media company Yahoo said its revenue rose 6.8 percent to $1.23 billion in the third quarter of 2015. Gross search revenue was $870 million for the third quarter of 2015, up 2 percent compared to the third quarter of 2014. Yahoo CEO: Executive exodus the “result of careful planning” \nRBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney last week released an earnings preview with a $47 price target noting the potential for a \"classic 'Net turnaround story\", but saying the company \"has its work cut out for it\". \nThe agreement, which will be reviewed by the Justice Department, comes after Yahoo in April amended the terms of its search partnership with Microsoft Corp.to give it more control over how search results are presented on both desktop computers and mobile devices. \nRevenue from Yahoo's Mavens segment climbed from $295 million a year ago to $422 million, while non-Mavens revenue fell from $727 million to $693 million. If you strip out those traffic acquisition costs, Yahoo! generated $1.043 billion in revenue this year, compared to $1.04 billion in the year-ago quarter. \nMayer also noted that the company's \"top priority\" is the planned spinoff of its remaining stake in Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba Group. \nMayer's management of Yahoo has drawn intense criticism over the previous year, with one NYU business professor making the inflamatory remark that the CEO would be out of a job were she not pregnant with twins. \nThe brightest part of the report was Mayer's discussion of its areas of focus with greater revenue growth, including mobile , video and social , what the company refers to as \" mavens \". He estimates revenues of $1.003 billion, shy of estimates of $1.025 billion. That's 64 basis points better since last Monday, when the first full week of earnings season began. \nThe ailing Web portal projected sales, excluding revenue shared with partner websites, of $920 million to $960 million, short of analysts' predictions of $1.08 billion. \nMayer is still promising to boost revenue and now it appears Google - the Internet's most profitable company - may play a key role. The big question, however, is whether Yahoo! will have to pay taxes on the spinoff.
