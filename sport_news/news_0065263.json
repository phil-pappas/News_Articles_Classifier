(AP Photo/Kathy Kmonicek) Sponsored Links The Associated Press NEW YORK — \nMatt Harvey finally made it to the New York Mets workout, and he had an explanation plenty of New Yorkers could understand — he was stuck in traffic. \nWhen the star pitcher didn't initially show Tuesday, general manager Sandy Alderson did not know why. Alderson believed the Citi Field workout was mandatory for all players. \nHarvey's agent, Scott Boras, also was in the dark at first. He told The Associated Press by phone he wasn't sure why his client wasn't there. But Harvey eventually showed and apologized for the late arrival. \nNew York opens its NL playoff series against the Dodgers on Friday night in Los Angeles. Harvey is to start Game 3 at Citi Field next Monday. The right-hander went 13-8 with a 2.71 ERA this year in his first season back from Tommy John surgery.
