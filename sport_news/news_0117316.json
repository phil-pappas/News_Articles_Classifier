The Cowboys thought they’d win at least two of the first four games Romo has missed, and possibly three. Now they’re 0–4 since Sept. 20 and facing home games against Seattle and Philadelphia, plus a road date with Tampa Bay, before Romo is eligible to return to the lineup in Week 11 at Miami. Will there be a season left to save by the time the quarterback is back? Or will a 2–7 team be sent staggering into the season’s backstretch at that point?\nJones said he’s not ready to give up on his Romo-less team, but he offered an admission brimming with honesty. \n“I know I was more confident that we could reach [our] goals when the season started than I am today,” he said. “We’re not the offensive team and we’re not the overall team [we expected to be]. We don’t have much margin at all. So we can’t make mistakes, with the makeup of our roster right now. We’re making mistakes that are beating us.” \nJones also stood firmly behind Cassel as the team’s starter after his 17 of 27, 227-yard, one-touchdown, three-interception day, showing no inclination to switch back to Brandon Weeden, who started the Cowboys’ first three games without Romo. \n“We will go with Cassel, certainly as far as I can see in the foreseeable future,” Jones said. “That’s all I can say. You ask me if I’m confident that Cassel can help us win several of the next ballgames, I don’t know that. But I saw decent things out there today that could have helped us win that ballgame, and then obviously those turnovers are back-breakers.” \n• While Dallas has gone 0–4 during Romo’s absence, the Giants have made up some serious ground, winning four out of five in that span. That puts New York in sole possession of first place in the NFC East if Philadelphia loses at Carolina Sunday night and gives New York its first win over the Cowboys since 2012. It also means the Giants are over .500 this late in the season for the first time since 2012, and that’s progress for Tom Coughlin’s inconsistent club. \nSo the Giants are the best team in a flawed division at the moment, but that’s worth celebrating a little bit, given New York’s 0–2 start. The Giants took care of the football against Dallas, committing no turnovers after a three-turnover loss at Philadelphia on Monday night, and when New York manages that, it’s usually on the winning side of things. \n<p>Your browser does not support iframes.</p> \n• I’m starting to think Philip Rivers is the modern-day Steve DeBerg: He plays just good enough to get you beat, as Bill Walsh once famously described DeBerg, his former 49ers quarterback. Rivers is a better quarterback than DeBerg ever dreamed of being, but another week of gaudy stats from Rivers did nothing to help the Chargers avoid falling to 2–5 and into a tie with Kansas City for last place in the AFC West. \nRivers threw for 503 yards at Green Bay last week, but San Diego only scored 20 points in defeat. He threw for 336 yards, with two interceptions and three touchdowns (all of those in the fourth quarter) in a 37–29 home loss to Oakland, but the Raiders led 37–6 at the end of three quarters, and that made the fourth quarter the epitome of garbage time. \nSan Diego’s defense was absolutely dreadful and deserves the bulk of the blame, of course, with Oakland scoring on its first seven drives. But Rivers is amassing a bunch of meaningless statistics this season, and where was the Chargers’ passing game when there was still a shot for San Diego to win on Sunday? \n• Break up the Raiders, who are 3–3 and have already matched their win total from last season. I can’t remember the last time Oakland won a game that felt like a blowout. Jack Del Rio’s club so thoroughly dominated the Chargers on the road that it might be a bit awkward if these two ever end up sharing that $1.7 billion proposed stadium they want to build together in Los Angeles. \nOakland quarterback Derek Carr is turning into a star before our eyes, and the resurgent Raiders now occupy sole possession of second place in the AFC West. Carr completed 20 of his opening 25 pass attempts, for 275 yards and three touchdowns, and finished 24 of 31 for 289 yards. Jets show playoff potential in loss to Patriots \nSports Illustrated's Chris Burke discusses the New York Jets 30-23 loss to the New England Patriots , but how head coach Todd Bowles has built a team that can succeed in the playoffs. \n• Smart move by the Patriots , deciding to live and die on Tom Brady ’s right arm against the upset-minded Jets . You’re never going to go broke taking that approach. Brady threw a whopping 54 passes in New England’s gritty 30–23 win, compared to just nine running plays, four of which were Brady carries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:55:10.561+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
