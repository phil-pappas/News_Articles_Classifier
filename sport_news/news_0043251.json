The victory also ties the series at eight wins apiece since 2008.\n\"I just told them to keep fighting and to stay mentally tough,\" Jupiter coach Blane Betz said. \"They came out and didn't overplay. They did what they needed to do.\"\nTied at two sets apiece, with the fifth set at 19-19, Jupiter got a huge kill from junior outside hitter Jayden Brown and a deft tip by junior Maggie Weeks to end it.\nBrown finished with 18 kills to lead the Warriors, who improve to 13-2 overall and 4-0 in district play. Weeks finished with 23 digs, 13 kills and four service aces, while senior Tommy Roberts pitched in with 21 digs in the win.\nJunior Christine Jarman — who missed all of last season with a torn ACL — led Boca Raton (12-2, 4-0) with 28 kills, 21 digs and 11 service points. Junior Jenna Culhan tallied 19 kills and sophomore Laura Stevenson added 20 digs.\n\"It came down to who wanted it more,\" Boca coach Amanda Angermeier said. \"Playing here is difficult, with the crowd and the noise, and the little things got us in the end.\"\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560b49eb/turbine/fl-boca-raton-jupiter-recap-0930-20150929"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:41:47.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
