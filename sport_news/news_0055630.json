Here are some highlights.\nHow much does the Big 12 need an undefeated Baylor to play and undefeated TCU?\nCarlton: \"It wouldn't hurt. The Big 12 desperately needs one or two teams in the playoff hunt in late November. And the only way that is going to happen is if those teams have zero or one loss, tops. There's no way a two-loss Big 12 champ makes the playoff.\"\nThrough three games which of the QB's has been the most impressive between Baker Mayfield, Mahomes, Trevone Boykin, and Mason Rudolph?\nCarlton: \"I would go with the exact order you posed the question. Mayfield has shown a swagger running a new offense and delivered a nice road win at Tennessee. Mahomes definitely impressed before his knee injury and even after. Boykin started slow this season but was huge at Tech. And Rudolph has Oklahoma State undefeated although he seemed to lose his confidence in the second half at Texas.\"\nIf Baylor didn't get good around the time the Aggies left for the SEC, how relevant would the Big 12 be right now? Do you think Texas Tech or Oklahoma State would simply be in the spot the Bears are?\nCarlton: \"Somebody might have stepped up, but let's not forget that Baylor has been really, really good the past two seasons. Baylor has beaten Texas four of the last five seasons and Oklahoma three of the last four. It has a four-game win streak against Tech. So don't dismiss what Baylor has accomplished.\"\nWe focus on the Texas teams and the two from Oklahoma. Is there a chance West Virginia is the best team?\nCarlton: \"Absolutely. I think that's a fascinating matchup in Norman this weekend. People don't realized that West Virginia might have the best defense and certainly the best secondary in the Big 12. Now, the schedule isn't helpful with trips to Oklahoma, Baylor and TCU.\"\nI have the strangest feeling that Kansas State is going to wreck someone's season this year. Does it happen this weekend against Oklahoma State?\nCarlton: \"Never underestimate a Bill Snyder team. That said, I'd like K-State's chances more if the game were in Manhattan. One intriguing chance for an upset: An early November game on a Thursday against Baylor. That could be interesting.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CHAT.\nOn Twitter:\n @ChuckCarltonDMN", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ChuckCarltonDMN"], "published": "2015-10-02T02:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:38:04.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
