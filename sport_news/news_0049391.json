He'll need extra work this season; Lehman's top returner hopes to lead team to top of Bronx II even though team graduated top three bowlers. Lehman's boys and girls bowling squads had the rest of the Bronx pinned last fall, winning their respective divisions with ease, but both suffered second-round KOs in the city-wide playoffs. Both Lions teams have a different look this season, so a few Bronx boys and girls teams believe they have what it takes to strike out the perennial powers this fall.\nBoys: Opponents, watch out: Lions, Wolverines set to strike\nLehman coach Marcie Felicies logged onto the PSAL Web site last week, looked at the preseason rankings and laughed.\nLehman, which finished 8-0 last season and hasn't lost a division game in the past three years, was ranked fourth in the Bronx.\n\"Are we underrated there?\" Felicies asked. \"Absolutely.\"\nThe rankings are based on returning bowlers, and Lehman, which lost its top three rollers from last season, was ranked behind Bronx Science, South Bronx and James Monroe.\nThe Lions' top returner is senior Matt King, who averaged 154 pins per contest last season, making him the top returning bowler in Bronx II.\n\"I wasn't too secure knowing that my best players are gone, (but) after tryouts I saw our potential,\" King said. \"I'm excited for the challenge.\"\nFelicies' squad lost in the second round of the playoffs last season, but the coach added several baseball players to this year's roster and says that she has a winner in sophomore Brian Siegel, the younger brother of 2006 captain David Siegel. The coach also has a message for anyone who reads too much into the preseason rankings. \"We'll show them in the season about being underrated,\" Felicies said. \"And as far as the Bronx goes, I know we'll be undefeated and at the top.\"\nJessica Drenzyk Evan Frankl has other ideas. The coach believes his \"Bronx Science Nine\" is the team to beat in the borough.\n\"I don't know about beating Lehman because we're not in the same division, but I'd like to scrimmage them,\" said Frankl, whose Wolverines lost in the first round of the playoffs last year.\nBronx Science is coming off an undefeated regular season and boasts three of the borough's top five returning bowlers. Frankl said his four best bowlers — Jack Geller, Jason Grabisch, Matthew Dunay and Scott Star — put his team near the top.\nThe Wolverines ranked 25th and the Lions finished 30th in the final PSAL rankings last year, so neither team is likely to contend for the city championship. But they'll certainly battle for bragging rights in the Bronx.\nGirls: Lehman lives large; JFK lurks\nWinning six of the past seven Bronx division titles is notable, but Lehman coach Anthony Schmerler says he can't take much credit. It has more to do, Schmerler says, with the quality of the competition.\nNo Bronx team has advanced past the second round of the PSAL playoffs in the past three seasons.\n\"It's not that we're always that talented,\" Schmerler said. \"It's just that there are inexperienced bowlers in the Bronx. Our girls don't have the experience of bowlers in Brooklyn or Staten Island.\"\nLauren Rivera The Lions may not be in the running for the PSAL title, but Lehman looks like it has enough returning talent to repeat as division champs.\nSenior Lauren Rivera led Bronx I with a 119-pin average last year, in her first season on the lanes. Schmerler, who also coaches Lehman's junior varsity softball squad, said Rivera has a natural feel for the sport and could raise her average to 130.\nThe Lions also return second-year bowlers Cristal Gonzalez (107) and Melissa Rivera (106), but Schmerler said the most important member may be junior Jessica Drenzyk, who didn't bowl for school last year yet averaged \"around 150 pins\" competing in the Van Nest Lanes youth league.\nSchmerler said he usually plucks bowlers from his softball team and teaches them basic mechanics on the lanes. Most, he said, find the transition from throwing strikes to rolling them to be pretty smooth.\n\"It's easy to get a bowler who comes in and rolls a 90 to 120; the hard part is getting them past that,\" the eighth-year coach said. \"To get a bowler who rolls 140 and bring her to 180, that's a matter of experience.\"\nAt Kennedy, coach Fred Singer returns plenty of experience from last year's squad, which finished a game behind Lehman for the Bronx I title. The Knights return seven of eight starters from last year's team, including a core of seniors who boast three years of playoff experience.\nKennedy captain Lisa Zhang led the Bronx in total pins (2,222) in 21 games last year. Senior teammate Stephanie Pinilla was right behind, with 2,073 pins in 20 games. Singer's team split the season series with Lehman last season, and he said his bowlers have displayed a been-there-done-that brand of confidence.\nThe coach stopped short of predicting a division title, and stressed that his team doesn't live or die with every win and loss.\n\"Of course it will be nice to get a division championship,\" Singer said. \"My girls are confident, and I think we'll be competitive in the (division), but at the end of the year I just want the kids to be proud of what they've done.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:01:58.742+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
