The region is wide-open, and it will be up to the Buccaneers to stay in the hunt when they host undefeated Alexander tonight. Looking at the standings, Allatoona is one of six teams that have a legitimate shot to claim it. Alexander currently sits atop the standings at 3-0. Allatoona is one of five teams with one loss. But a win over Alexander would put Allatoona in at least a tie for first place.And a bye week last week should make the Buccaneers fresh. “I feel we are on the right track moving forward,” Allatoona coach Gary Varner said. “We’re right back in it going up against Alexander. We’re just trying to get refocused and see if we can get a win at home this week.”Allatoona has made improvements in all three phases of the game since its disappointing loss to East Paulding in the season opener. But against South Paulding two weeks ago, leaders started to emerge on offense. The Buccaneers trailed the Spartans for the first three quarters before making their move in the fourth behind running back Russell Halimon. Halimon, who is committed to Arizona, had carries of 17 and 15 yards on one drive before scoring from 33 yards out to give Allatoona the lead. He had several more long runs on Allatoona’s next drive before quarterback Brandon Rainey scored on a 1-yard scamper to seal it. In facing Alexander, the Buccaneers will have to keep the Cougars’ offense off the field. Alexander scored more than 40 points in wins over Douglas County and Paulding County to start the season, and then scored 50 in its win over Lithia Springs.Varner said the Cougars’ Baylor Whitfield appears to be more comfortable in his second season as the starting quarterback.“They move the ball well and score a lot of points,” Varner said. “They have a second-year starter (at quarterback), and that’s a big difference. That’s kind of where you start in trying to stop them.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:41:08.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
