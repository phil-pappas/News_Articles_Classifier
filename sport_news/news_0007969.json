Lisa Ann Vilmur, 43, of the Groveland area, was arrested July 30 on suspicion of recklessly causing a fire of a structure or forest land, a felony. She was released Sept. 16 from Tuolumne County Jail on $100,000 bond. Vilmur was present for Tuesday’s hearing before Judge Frank Dougherty. Dressed in a black blouse and gray pants, she frequently looked around the Department 1 courtroom. Vilmur’s attorney, Charles Stoner requested a trial date be set at a later time. “We’re trying to get our expert out,” he said, adding that the expert will do a scene investigation. “This is a very complicated fire case.” Dougherty then set a trial setting conference for Oct. 26. The Big Creek Fire was sparked July 29 off Highway 120 and Sprague Road, near Groveland and was fully contained Aug. 4, after burning 204 acres. Cal Fire officials said the blaze, which threatened 25 homes, was caused by an escaped debris pile burn. Vilmur pleaded not guilty Aug. 7 in Tuolumne County Superior Court before Judge Eleanor Provost.
