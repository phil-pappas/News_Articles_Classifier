Works hard, is a well-conditioned player, trains hard.\"\nAside from his work ethic, Lewis has impressed his coach with his ability to absorb the playbook and apply it to the field.\n\"What we do on offense is extensive,\" Belichick said. \"He's done a good job of learning obviously all the running back stuff, but extended play, empty plays where he's playing out the of the backfield.\"\nAnd, of course, Belichick loves versatile players, and Lewis has shown an ability to be a four-down one.\n\"He's shown value in the kicking game,\" Belichick said. \"He's shown value on all three downs on offense. He's done a good job of learning a lot of different spots, a lot of different adjustments, blitz pickups and so forth in the passing game.\"\nAdd to that Lewis' ability to make people miss in the open field and his \"short-area quickness,\" as Belichick said, the commitment to Lewis makes sense.\nSo consider, at least for now, the Patriots more stable at a position that looked the opposite during the offseason with the losses of Shane Vereen (Giants) and Stevan Ridley (Jets).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:56:20.587+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
