Considering the public outcry generated by previous TUD rate increases, some in attendance said they were surprised by the small turnout. “It’s disappointing to see the lack of public interest,” said Kristine Rice, of Columbia, who attended with her husband, Jesse. A video was shown highlighting several planned upgrades to the district’s water and sewer system over the five-year period, including a $2.8 million project to construct a 600,000-gallon water tank that would replace three aging tanks serving the Columbia and Sonora water systems. This year’s budget included no money for such projects because the cash-strapped district is barely keeping up with operating costs under current rates, which generate nearly $10 million in revenue each year on average. “Typically, an agency this size would spend over $2 million a year keeping up with failing systems, replacing pipe and what have you,” said Dave Andres, TUD’s interim general manager. “We had no money to do that this year.” Andres blamed the shortage of money for projects on a lack of rate increases to keep up with high maintenance costs. The district plans to invest about $14.5 million for projects to upgrade the TUD water system, as well as about $5.5 million for the sewer-system upgrades. “Quite frankly, that’s a drop in the bucket,” Andres said. “We’ve identified $57 million in new (water) projects that need to be built, but what we’re proposing in the first five years is just the most critical projects.” Andres said the district will attempt to get grants and low-interest loans to help pay for the other needed projects, but the current rates are too low for TUD to qualify for many state and federal funding programs. Most programs require the district to charge at least 1.5 percent of the area’s median income to qualify for funding. The median income in Tuolumne County is about $46,000. The district’s water rates are lower than many other water purveyors in the region, including Nevada Irrigation District, the City of Angels Camp, South Tahoe Public Utility District, Twain Harte Community Services District, Groveland Community Services District, Calaveras County Water District and Amador Water Agency. A typical residential customer -- about 9,000 of TUD’s 14,000 customers -- would see their monthly water bill increase from about $45.38 to $60 beginning in 2016 under the proposed rate plan. The same customer would be paying about $81.50 a month for water by 2020. An average customer’s monthly sewer rate would increase from about $35.59 to $40 by 2016. Sewer rates would gradually increase to about $51 per month by 2020. The Rices, who are both retired and living on a fixed income, said they were disappointed to hear their bill would nearly double over the next five years, but believed the increases were necessary based on what they heard Tuesday. “For what it’s worth, I think the board should adopt the increases,” Jesse Rice said. “They’re thinking long term instead of 12-month increments, which is good to see.” Hans Bayer, of Sonora, who attended Tuesday with his mother, Gwen Bayer, of Columbia, said he understands the high cost of maintaining a widespread rural water system because he works as a watershed keeper for the City and County of San Francisco’s Hetch Hetchy Water System. Bayer said he thinks many of the people who have complained about similar proposed rate increases in the past likely moved to the county from urban areas. “A lot are from bigger cities and don’t understand the difficult aspects of water delivery in a rural environment,” he said. The district will be hosting similar community forums over the next few weeks in other areas of the county, including: • Soulsbyville: 6 to 8 p.m. Thursday at Soulsbyville Elementary School’s old gymnasium, 20300 Soulsbyville Road. • Tuolumne: 6 to 8 p.m. Oct. 20 at Summerville High School’s auditorium, 17555 Tuolumne Road. • Sonora: 6 to 8 p.m. Oct. 26 at Tuolumne Utilities District, 18885 Nugget Boulevard, in the TUD board room.
