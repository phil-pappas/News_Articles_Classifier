That's when Pro Bowl defensive end Greg Hardy and middle linebacker Rolando McClain rejoin the team after each served a four-game suspension to start the season.\nCowboys coach Jason Garrett said Friday he anticipates both players will be \"ready to go\" for practice Wednesday. McClain has been working out at Valley Ranch, but under the terms of Hardy's suspension he wasn't allowed to workout at the team facility.\nCowboys coaches haven't been allowed to have contact with Hardy during his suspension, but club athletic trainer Britt Brown was allowed to keep in touch with him.\nCowboys weak-side linebacker Sean Lee said he's excited for the return of McClain. With Lee missing all of last season, the two have yet to start a game alongside each other for the Cowboys.\n\"Can't wait for him to get back,\" Lee said. \"He's ready to go. He's chomping at the bit to get back and he's been working extremely hard. He looks great. He's a natural. By next week, he'll be ready to practice and be ready to go.\"\nTwitter: @DMN_George\nMORE MUST-READ COWBOYS Is Brandon Weeden the answer at QB?\nCowboys VP: Brandon Weeden needs to step up, missed opportunities in Atlanta game\nMoore: The truth about Cowboys QB Brandon Weeden's ability to throw\nCowlishaw: Cowboys must test Brandon Weeden soon, because Patriots sure will\n10 things to know about Cowboys QB Brandon Weeden, including the first impression he made on Dez Bryant\nDo the Dallas Cowboys have a quarterback controversy?
