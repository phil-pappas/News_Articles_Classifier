Even with quarterback Tony Romo and wide receiver Dez Bryant, the Dallas Cowboys weren’t willing to roll over. Sunday’s matchup inside AT&T Stadium had the makings of a trap game for the defending Super Bowl champions and in the first half, the Pats were on shaky ground. But even with injuries to linebacker Dont’a Hightower and left tackle Nate Solder, the Patriots once again showed to everyone why they’re one of the best in the NFL. The Patriots powered through and past the Dallas Cowboys, 30-6, on Sunday, improving to 4-0 after another dominant win. This is the eighth time in franchise history that the Patriots won their first four games and fourth time with Bill Belichick and Tom Brady. With the win, Brady becomes the third quarterback in NFL history with at least four 4-0 starts, joining Fran Tarkenton and Peyton Manning. In the first half, little came easy for the Patriots and their offensive line. On their first drive, Brady hit Julian Edelman for a 21-yard gain. The Cowboys also got flagged for an unnecessary roughness penalty, pushing the Pats to the 32. A sack by Rolando McClain, however, pushed the team back and they were forced to punt. The Patriots got some points on the second, thanks to Stephen Gostkowski’s 49-yard field goal at 2:04 of the first After a nice punt return by Danny Amendola, the Patriots started their second drive at the 45-yard line. Brady hit Dion Lewis for 14 yards to start. Greg Hardy sacked Brady on the next play for a loss of seven. The team wouldn’t pick up a first down, but Gostkowski still put up points on the scoreboard. The Cowboys came right back to the tie the game, 3-3, with a 51-yard field goal from Dan Bailey with 1:52 left in the first quarter. The Patriots offensive line started to slowly fall apart in the second quarter. On the team’s fourth drive of the game, Brady got sacked twice. The first was by Greg Hardy and was a strip sack. The Pats got lucky as Julian Edelman recovered the ball. The next came on third down as Jack Crawford got to Brady, forcing the Patriots to punt. Brady was sacked five times in the first half. He was sacked six times in three games before Sunday. On top of that, Solder suffered an elbow injury and came out of the game. The Patriots also lost Hightower, who suffered a rib injury in the first quarter. But despite it all, the Patriots were able to separate themselves from the Cowboys. The Patriots extend their lead to 10-3, thanks to Brady in the second quarter. The Patriots started at the 45-yard line on this drive after a nice punt return by Danny Amendola. Brady hit Julian Edelman for a gain of 16 to start the drive and move the team over the 50-yard line. Dion Lewis then took over. He caught a 9-yard pass and then rushed for 13 to set up a first-and-goal from the 1-yard line. Page 2 of 2 - The Patriots came out looking like they would run, with Shaq Mason as the fullback and LeGarrette Blount as the running back, but instead, Brady kept the ball and easily scored to give the Pats the lead. Gostkowski continued his terrific season, hitting 57-yard field goal with eight seconds left in the first half to give the Patriots a 13-3 lead. The Pats got the ball back to open the second half and Dion Lewis showed everyone why he was worth the recent contract extension. The running back made four Cowboys defenders miss, after hauling in a catch with one hand, en route to a 10-yard touchdown reception. After making only one catch for six yards in the first half, the Patriots decided to get Rob Gronkowski going. The tight end jump started this drive with a 33-yard catch. Then on third down, he hauled in another pass, this time for 18 yards. Three plays later, Lewis scored at 5:12 of the third and the Patriots had a 20-3 lead. The Cowboys charged down the field on the next drive, but the Patriots’ defense wouldn’t break. Dallas got all the way to the 7-yard line, but settled for a 23-yard field goal from Bailey and the Pats lead, 20-6. After the field goal, the Patriots’ defense caused turnovers on the next two Dallas drives with a force fumble by Jamie Collins and then an interception by Logan Ryan. Edelman also got in the action next, scoring on a 59-yard pass from Brady to give the Patriots a 27-6 lead. The wide out caught the ball near the left sideline and made multiple Cowboys defenders miss as he cut back to the middle of the field at 13:10 of the fourth quarter. Gostkowski hit his third field goal of the game, from 34 yards, with 4:41 left in the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:28:01.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
