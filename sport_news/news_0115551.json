They boast a district mark of 22-2 since 2012, and this season they have avenged their only two losses, which came to Stony Point and Round Rock in 2014. \nSenior quarterback Carrington Kearney scored the winning touchdown on a 1-yard run early in the fourth quarter. He finished with 96 yards rushing as Hendrickson totaled 322. D.J. Jackson topped the Hawks with 119 yards while teammate Lawrence Hill added 86.

CREDIT: Henry Huey/For American-Statesman \nThe Dragons (6-2, 4-1) scored first when Liam Beard’s 66-yard pass to A. J. Burleson set up Beard’s 2-yard plunge for a touchdown. Kearney then led Hendrickson on a 71-yard scoring drive, capped by the senior quarterback’s 3-yard carry. Chase Parker’s extra point put the Hawks on top 7-6, but Alex Dockery put the Dragons back in front by booting a 50-yard field goal. \nJordan Williams returned the ensuing kickoff to the Dragons’ 15-yard line, and Jackson ended the short scoring drive with a 4-yard TD run. Round Rock went back ahead before halftime on Beard’s second rushing touchdown from a yard out, but Hendrickson stuffed a two-point conversion attempt to trail 15-14. \nBeard passed for 263 yards, but the Dragons rushed for only 48.

He was 4-of-4 passing on the drive, finishing it with a perfectly timed, 7-yard slant to Paxton Segina for the go-ahead score with 1:31 to go. \nDrippings Springs’ final drive ended with an interception that came on the second play. \nVandegrift, ranked seventh in the Associated Press Class 5A state poll, improved to 7-1, 4-1 in District 25-5A. Dripping Springs fell to 4-3, 2-3. \nThe first half ended in 35-35 tie. The scoring — and there was plenty of it — started with Vandegrift’s Cole Walther returning a twice-deflected pass 48 yards for a touchdown. \nBefore the half ended, the fans at Monroe Stadium had seen touchdown runs of 75 and 63 yards by Vandegrift’s Travis Brannan, a 33-yard touchdown reception by Dripping Springs’ Ethan Fernea on third-and-23 and a 21-yard receptions by Fernea on fourth down-and-12 that put the Tigers at the 1-yard line. They scored on the next play to tie the game with seven seconds to go in the half. \n— Mark Swanson, AA-S correspondent \nCedar Ridge 38, Rouse 6: Cedar Ridge (7-1, 4-1) clinched a playoff spot from District 13-6A, posting a runaway victory over Rouse (2-6, 2-4). \nThe result between teams with the same mascot — Raiders — and fight song eliminated Rouse from playoff contention. \nCedar Ridge quarterback Garrett Sharp passed for 161 yards and ran for 125 more to lead the offense. He connected with Kadarius Daniels for a pair of touchdowns and ran for an 8-yard score before he and the rest of the Cedar Ridge’s starters watched the fourth quarter from the sidelines. \nThe Cedar Ridge defense forced five turnovers in the victory, including interceptions by Michael Seijo, Colby Petterson, Deverette Williams and James Celey. \nRouse’s offense revolved around running back Marquis Simmons, who gained 275 yards on 35 carries. Simmons also scored Rouse’s only points when he broke loose for a 77-yard touchdown with 6:57 to go in the fourth quarter. \nCJ Rittenhouse ran for 84 yards on 15 carries for Cedar Ridge while Simi Bakare added 57 yards and a pair of touchdowns on just six carries. \n— Sean Shapiro, AA-S correspondent \nBowie 38, Hays 17: Brandon Ramos threw four touchdown passes as the Bulldogs (7-1, 5-1) moved into a second-place tie with Westlake in District 14-6A by dropping the Rebels (4-5, 3-4) at Burger Stadium. \nRamos cashed in on Bowie’s first series with a fade to Cash Cavitt from 13 yards out. Cavitt was one of four receivers to catch a touchdown from Ramos, who finished 18 of 23 for 162 yards. \nThe Bulldogs got the ball right back after miscommunication in the Rebels backfield led to a Hays fumble. Josh Marini then booted a 41-yard field goal to put Bowie up 10-0 in the opening quarter. \nA 19-yard punt in the second quarter gave Bowie the ball at midfield. Ramos then connected with Sam Portillo from three yards out for the touchdown. \nHays starting quarterback Tyler Connally was knocked out of the game in the second quarter. Cody Reilly came in and gave the Rebels a brief spark when he hit Cade Powell on a post route on 4th-and-21. Powell then ran it in from three yards out on the next play. \nJosh Wainwright caught a 6-yard scoring pass from Ramos right before the half. Wainwright finished with eight catches for 80 yards. \nAfter a 9-yard TD toss from Ramos to Caden Donohue in the fourth quarter made it 31-10 Bulldogs, Isaac Castilleja, the Rebels third quarterback on the night, found Duston Bruno for a 41-yard pass to the 1-yard line. Cody Gandy score on the next play. \nA long drive led by bruising Bowie backup quarterback Matthew Wheeler was capped by a 9-yard run by Desmond Young to seal the Bulldogs victory. \n— Travis Atkins, AA-S correspondent \nStony Point 49, McNeil 31: Shapiro King rushed 31 times for 240 yards and three touchdowns and Derrick Johnson completed a pair of scoring passes to Tyree Thomas to lead the host Tigers (5-3, 2-3) over the Mavericks (3-5, 2-3) in a battle for the fourth and final playoff spot in in District 13-6A. \nKing scored on runs of 1, 10 and 17 yards. Johnson delivered scoring passes of 29 and 43 yards to Thomas. \nMcNeil’s Hayden Cooper completed 21 of 46 passes for 384 yards and four touchdowns. Cooper threw two scoring passes to Jaden Lepisto and two to Jonathon Boozer, including an 84-yard hookup. \nThe three Stony Point losses were to the top three teams in the district — Round Rock, Cedar Ridge and Hendrickson — putting the Tigers in position to make the playoffs by winning out. \nStony Point scored first when the Tigers took advantage of great field possession, their defense forcing the Mavericks to punt on their first series with the Tigers taking over at the McNeil 49-yard line. Stony Point covered that ground in seven plays with King scoring on a sweep left. \nTrailing 7-0, Cooper executed a play fake into the line on a read option, pulled the ball back and lofted a 43-yard scoring toss right down the middle to Jaden Lepisto for a 7-7 tie through the first quarter. \nJohnson matched Cooper on the next Tigers possession, connecting with Thomas on a 29-yard scoring toss down the right sideline. Thomas ran a fly route with the Mavericks defenders losing coverage and Thomas running wide open. \nLeading 14-7, the Tigers recovered a Mavericks fumble on the next play from scrimmage to take over on the McNeil 25. King carried the ball 16 yards on first down, then Deshun Horner took a handoff and ran wide left the final nine yards for the third Tigers touchdown of the first half. \nMcNeil answered with a 74-yard scoring drive, Cooper connecint with Lepisto on a 20-yard pass to cut the margin to 21-14 with 3:43 left in the first half. \nStony Point struck back quickly. Johnson hooked up with Thomas on a 43-yard scoring play. \nMavericks kicker Luis Balderas ended the first-half scoring with a 25-yard field goal with 13 seconds left, trimming the deficit to 28-17. \nKing picked up his second TD of the game on the opening series of the second half. After racing 40 yards to the Maverick 10, King took it 10 yards to the end zone for a 35-17 lead with 10:21 to play in the third quarter. \nThen it was McNeil’s turn. Jonathon Boozer grabbed a short Cooper pass and raced 84 yards for a Mavericks touchdown that closed the gap to 35-24 with 5:52 left in the third. \nThe teams continued to punch it out the rest of the way. Stony Point put the game on ice with a 67-yard drive capped by Johnson’s 2-yard run, with a 45-yard Johnson-to-King pass setting it up. \n— Butch Hart, AA-S correspondent \nVista Ridge 30, Georgetown 25: Isaiah Vilaire delivered three touchdowns, one on a 99-yard return of the opening kickoff, and the Rangers defense turned away two Eagles passes in the end zone in the final seconds to hang on for a thrilling District 25-5A victory at Gupton Stadium. \nVilaire, who racked up 95 yards on 14 carries, added a 21-yard rushing score midway through the third quarter and a 7-yard scoring burst with 2:47 to play that seemingly salted the game away for Vista Ridge (7-1, 4-1), ranked 10th in the state. \nGeorgetown (5-3, 2-3) wasn’t nearly done. The Eagles climbed to within five points on a 43-yard TD pass from Chandler Herman to Richard Bueno with 2:02 remaining. The Eagles got the ball back on their own 10-yard line with 52 seconds to play. \nVista Ridge employed an all-out prevent defense, with three rushers, four defenders 20 yards off the ball and four more 40 yards off the line of scrimmage. Herman took advantage of the loose coverage to quickly move Georgetown down the field in seven plays, all the way to the Vista Ridge 25 with 10 seconds remaining. But Herman’s final two tosses fell incomplete. \nHerman ended up throwing for 317 yards and two scores, one to Beau Corrales from 29 yards. Corrales reeled in 13 catches for 156 yards. \nMatt Snow chipped in with 87 yards on 23 carries for the Rangers, who were outgained 491-331. \n— Steve Habel, AA-S correspondent \nCedar Park 51, Marble Falls 3: The top-ranked Timberwolves (8-0, 4-0 District 25-5A) scored on the second play of the game and never looked back in pounding the host Mustangs (2-6, 0-5). \nCedar Park did most of its damage on the ground as the Wolves threw only five passes. Eleven players carried the ball for Cedar Park. Tyler Lavine gained 50 yards with two touchdowns rushing and one receiving to lead the group. \nJacob Metcalf caught six passes for 54 yards for Marble Falls. \nThe Wolves methodically marched to a 35-3 halftime lead. Tyler Lavine had scoring runs of 5 and 9 yards and caught a 34-yard touchdown pass from Mak Sexton. Tommy Lavine scored a first-quarter touchdown on a 47-yard scamper. Gavino Tinajera made a 24-yard field goal for the Mustangs just before halftime. \n— Ken Whalen, AA-S correspondent \nLeander 54, East View 14: The Lions rode the hot first-half passing of Parker McNeil, and Leander (4-4, 3-2) continued its chase for a District 25-5A playoff berth with a 40-point win over the host Patriots (3-5, 0-5) on a muggy night in Georgetown. \nMcNeil completed 14 of 19 first-half passes for 315 yards and five touchdowns. Three of those scoring strikes covered at least 25 yards. \nMichael Berry had touchdown catches of 25 and 11 yards for the Lions. Gabriel Sanchez and Dalton Flowers rolled up 113 and 110 yards receiving, respectively and a touchdown apiece. \nLeander finished with 589 yards total offense. After being bottled up for 23 yards rushing in the first half, the Lions finished with 274 yards rushing. Matthew Long led a balanced attack with 85 yards on eight carries, including a 65-yard scoring scamper on the first play from scrimmage of the second half. \nEast View’s Torrie Davis rushed for 75 yards on 18 carries, with 65 of those coming on a scoring run in the opening quarter. Quinn Stewart scored on a 53-yard pass from Austin Moreno in the fourth quarter. \nLeander will host Vista Ridge next Friday in a game with playoff implications. \n— Mark Champ, AA-S correspondent \nBastrop 42, Cedar Creek 20: Jovahn Jones rushed for 260 yards and four scores to spark the Bears (5-3, 3-2) over the host Eagles (3-5, 3-2). \n“Jovahn did what he has been doing all year for us,” coach Todd Patmon said. “He made some big runs and some big plays.” \nJones scored on carries of 9, 43, 25 and 30 yards to help the Bears hold off the Eagles, who made things interesting through the better part of three quarters. \n“Cedar Creek played hard, and they are well-coached,” Patmon said. “They are a good team.” \nThe Eagles struck first, exciting their home side of BISD Memorial Stadium when Tristan Hendrix hooked up with Selvin Espinoza for a 46-yard touchdown pass. That gave Cedar Creek its first-ever lead in the rivalry series. \nBastrop took control by scoring the next 21 points on a Jaden Watson 1-yard run and a pair of Jones’ scores. \nCedar Creek narrowed the gap right before the half when Hendrix again found Espinoza for a 29-yard score to give the Eagles momentum heading into the locker room. \nIn the third quarter, Cedar Creek made things interesting when Espinosa and Hendrix connected for a third time and cut the lead to 28-20. \nBastrop stepped on the gas pedal down the stretch, scoring on a Calvin Henricks’ 20-yard touchdown pass and a Jones’ final TD of the night. \nThe Bears rushed for 405 yards. The Eagles flew by air, with Hendrix going 12 of 28 for 225 yards passing. \n— Chris Dukes, ACN \nPflugerville 27, Westwood 14: First-half defensive touchdowns from linebacker RJ Petaia and defensive back Alex Shillow helped Pflugerville post a District 13-6A victory over winless Westwood. \nPflugerville (2-6, 2-3) limited Westwood to 83 yards rushing while the Panthers piled up 296 yards on the ground. \nEarly in the first quarter, Pataia picked up a fumble and returned it 10 yards, scoring on one of four takeaways forced by Pflugerville’s opportunistic defense. Westwood answered when quarterback Jack Swenson found a streaking Te’Shon McGinnis for a 72-yard touchdown pass to deadlock the score at 7. \nShillow stepped in at quarterback late in the opening quarter and scrambled for a 7-yard touchdown run. A quarter later, Shillow’s 90-yard interception return gave the Panthers a 21-7 lead at halftime. \nPflugerville’s Jaylan Merriweather added a 39-yard touchdown run midway through the fourth quarter. \n— Ryan Metz, AA-S correspondent \nHutto 42, Elgin 8: Tyler Herrick and Dearyon Milligan produced all six Hutto touchdowns as the Hippos (5-3, 2-2) trounced the host Wildcats (1-7, 1-4) in a District 17-5A matchup. \nHerrick’s night was particularly productive. He amassed 298 total yards – 123 on the ground, 175 through the air – along with four touchdowns. His biggest moment came near the end of the first half, when he split the Elgin defense up the middle for an 88-yard touchdown run. His night ended after the third quarter with Hutto leading 42-8. \nMilligan played into the fourth quarter, delivering punishing runs through sporadic light rain. He finished with 119 yards and two touchdowns. Milligan’s standout moment was a 28-yard rush in the first quarter that gave the Hippos an early 7-0 lead. \nConversely, the Elgin offense sputtered all night. The Hippos defense held the Wildcats multi-faceted rushing attack to 80 yards on 37 carries, routinely stuffing Elgin runners at or behind the line of scrimmage. Six Wildcats had rushing attempts, yet none averaged more than three yards. \nElgin’s only score came on a 6-yard run by Jacob Cook early in the third quarter. The touchdown was set up by a 51-yard pass from Deamante Strong to Tariq Buchanan. \nEarly on, Hutto’s leading receiver, Tristen Bayless, was surprisingly silent. He had only two catches in the first half, but Bayless made up for lost time in the third quarter, hauling in a 67-yard touchdown pass from Herrick to seal the Hippos 34-point victory. \n— Mike Schoeffel, AA-S correspondent \nTravis 19, Lanier 13: Defense delivered at the right moments as the host Rebels (1-7, 1-4) snapped a nine-game losing streak, grabbing their first win of 2015 by downing the Vikings (4-4, 1-4). \nTravis’ victory came almost one year to the date of its last win, 62-16 over Lanier. This one was much more hard-fought. \nLanier took a quick 7-0 lead just over two minutes into the game when Juanye Johnson ran it in from 4 yards out. \nTravis responded with an Elias Millet 16-yard TD run early in the second quarter to make it 7-6. \nThe Vikings outgained the Rebels 368-229, but the Travis defense provided two important red-zone stops that made the difference. They held the Vikings on first and goal at the end of the first half and forced a turnover in the end zone on Lanier’s first possession of the third quarter. \nThose stops provided the window Breonn Watson needed. The Travis quarterback ran for 102 yards and two touchdowns. \nWatson’s first score was a 24-yard run that put Travis up 12-7. Then, following a Rebel fourth-down stop with less than two minutes to play in the game, Watson sprinted 46 yards to push the lead to 19-7 and seal the win. \nJohnson (177 yards) and quarterback Josh Torres (80 yards, one TD) carried the Lanier offense. Torres’ score came on a 40-yard run with 4 seconds left in the game. The Vikings attempted an onside kick, but it was recovered by the Rebels. \nWatson (102 yards), Jaaylom Vasquez (64 yards) and Millet (56 yards) accounted for 222 of the Rebels’ 227 total yards. \n— Chris Allman, AA-S correspondent \nBoerne-Champion 47, Lockhart 26: Josh Green completed 19 of 23 passes for 336 yards and four TDs as the Chargers (5-3, 5-1) beat the host Lions (7-2, 5-2) in a game that had 53 points in a frenetic fourth quarter. \nBoerne-Champion led 20-0 through three quarters when things got crazy. Three defensive touchdowns were put up in the final period. \nTalented Lockhart running back DJ Ellison, held in check all night, finally got his team on the board with a 2-yard run. Lions defender Belar Sneed followed with a 54-yard fumble recovery for a score to close to 20-13. \nThe Chargers stretched the margin back out to 27-13, but Stephon Houston snatched a 75-yard scoring pass from Nick Sanchez and it was 27-20. Boerne-Champion responded with three TDs, including a 98-yard fumble return and a 12-yard pick six, before Lockhart got the final score. \nEllison managed only 49 yards in 21 carries. Houston picked up the slack for the Lions with 111 yards on 19 trips and 84 yards on two catches. \nGiddings 38, La Grange 20: Kyle Jones threw two long touchdown passes to Chabastin Taylor and threw for more than 200 yards, as the host Buffaloes (8-0, 2-0) used a big-play offense to beat the Leopards (6-3, 1-2) and remain undefeated. \nJones also hooked up with Zach Albers on some explosive plays, and Jason James ran for a touchdown for Giddings. \nThe Buffaloes defense held running back J.K. Dobbins in check for much of the night. Dobbins, one of the top 2017 recruits in the country, had a touchdown in the first half. \nGiddings has a bye next week and then hosts Caldwell in what is likely the District 11-4A, Div. II title game. La Grange finishes the regular season at Salado. \nHyde Park 13, Victoria St. Joseph 6: The visiting Panthers (7-0, 3-0), staring at their first loss of the season, rallied with two touchdowns in the fourth quarter to beat the Flyers (1-8, 1-4). \nHyde Park was shut out through three quarters when defensive tackle Garrett Yarbrough made the play of the night – if not the season – for the Panthers. He recovered a fumble near the St. Joseph goal line and took it three yards to the house. Brandt Peterson kicked the decisive extra point for a 7-6 lead. \nRunning back Seth DeVries gave Hyde Park a bit of breathing room with a 3-yard touchdown with 3:30 left in the game for the final score. DeVries provided most of the offense for the Panthers with 126 yards rushing on 21 carries. His team only had 224 yards total offense. \nBrooks Benkendorfer, as usual, was a huge defensive force for Hyde Park, making 14 tackles. \nLuling 35, Ingram Moore 0: Quarterback Kaylon Coe scored on two long-distance runs in the first half, and the Eagles defense pitched a shutout against the host Warriors (4-4, 1-2). Luling (2-6, 2-1) held Moore (4-4, 1-2) to 128 total yards and six first downs. \nCoe reeled off touchdown runs of 45 and 41 yards, and the Eagles D added a safety for a 15-0 first-half advantage. \nLuling tacked on three lengthy scoring plays – each in the third quarter. Colton Hajovsky hauled in a 51-yard TD pass from Coe with 11:08 left in the period. The elusive Shaft Cubit ran 28 yards for six points less than two minutes later. Then after a quick defensive stop by the Eagles, Desmond Cubit returned a punt 81 yards for a touchdown. \nCoe dashed for 109 yards on nine carries. Shaft Cubit had 77 on 10 trips. \nRockdale 28, Little River Academy 20: David Franklin tossed three touchdown passes, and the visiting Tigers (6-2, 2-1) scored all their points in the first half then held on to beat the Bumblebees (4-4, 1-2). \nFranklin hit Ray Trevino for a 40-yard score with 10 minutes left in the first quarter. After Little River tied it, Franklin went 24 yards to Davion Ford with 30 seconds to go in the opening period. \nFord raced 45 yards for a TD to make it 21-7 with nine minutes remaining in the half. The Bumblebees cut the deficit to seven again, but Franklin restored order, finding Christian Lara for a 14-yard score with 40 seconds left in the half. Ford was Rockdale’s top gainer with 113 yards on 17 carries. \nCanyon Lake 17, Fredericksburg 6: The Hawks (4-4, 2-1) held the visiting Battlin’ Billies (5-3, 1-2) to seven first downs and 132 yards total offense. Canyon Lake outrushed Fredericksburg 246-39. \nCole Bourgeois prevented a shutout for the Billies, catching a 15-yard touchdown pass from Jonny Cleland in the fourth quarter. Bourgeois had four receptions for 31 yards. \nCaldwell 43, Smithville 14: Joseph Crnkovic passed for 287 yards and four touchdowns as Caldwell (6-3, 3-0) remained unbeaten in District 11-4A, Division II. \nCrnkovic’s TD passes included a 65-yarder to Devin Morris and a 74-yarder to Curtis Williams. Keyshawn Chambers scored twice for the Hornets on carries of 58 and 47 yards. \nSmithville (1-7, 0-2) scored twice in the final quarter. DJ Chandler recorded a touchdown on a 2-yard run, and Garrett Mathis tossed a 10-yard Td pass to Chris Lewis. \n— Robbie Brown, AA-S correspondent \nSt. Andrew’s 28, St. Stephen’s 14: Evan Marshman threw for two touchdowns and ran for another as the host Crusaders (8-1, 3-0) held off the Spartans (6-3, 2-1). \nSt. Andrew’s built a 21-0 halftime lead and stretched it to 28-0 before St. Stephen’s broke through. \nCole Baker, the game’s leading rusher with 144 yards on 26 carries, gave the Crusaders a 7-0 edge on a 22-yard run. Then Marshman went to work, finding Blair Herman on two scoring passes. Marshman’s 3-yard TD run in the third quarter capped his team’s scoring. \nUzoma Akunebu had a short TD catch and Bryar Topo a 1-yard TD run for the Spartans. \nBrownsville St. Joseph 29, St. Michael’s 26: Quarterback Kai Money scored on a 51-yard run to give the Bloodhounds (7-1, 3-0) a win over the visiting Crusaders (4-4, 2-1). Earlier Money had a 67-yard TD run and a 10-yard TD toss. \nThis game was close all the way. Quarterback Gabriel Vondrak had a 20-yard scoring run for St. Michael’s in the first quarter, and the Crusaders held a 19-14 halftime advantage as Da’sean Johnson added a 1-yard TD run and Pedro Tijernia booted field goals of 35 and 25 yards. \nConner Gjerset’s 7-yard catch from Vondrak put the Crusaders ahead 26-21 in the fourth quarter before St. Joseph’s Money play. \nWaco La Vega 39, Lampasas 16: The Pirates (8-0, 3-0) remained unbeaten, rushing for 498 yards in a win over the visiting Badgers (2-6, 0-3). \nQuarterback Cohen Cockburn had a 2-yard TD run and Jared Salazar a 42-yard field goal in the second quarter to bring Lampasas within 18-10 at the half, but La Vega stretched its lead to 32-10 after three quarters. Cockburn was the Badgers’ top ground gainer with 78 yards on 17 carries. \nCameron Yoe 51, Lago Vista 7: Traion Smith rushed for five touchdowns and 193 yards as the Yoeman (7-1, 3-0) easily handled the host Vikings (2-6, 1-2). \nLago Vista moved the ball well, gaining 353 yards, including 234 rushing, but shot itself in the foot with four lost fumbles. Jacob Carpeno ran for 93 yards on just eight carries for the Vikings. \nTroy 47, Florence 6: Garrett Qualey and Marc Hooks combined to rush for 369 yards and split six touchdowns as the Trojans (7-1, 2-1) stampeded the host Buffaloes (4-4, 0-3). \nEdel Hernandez was the Florence bright spot with 144 yards on 31 carries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:24:14.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
