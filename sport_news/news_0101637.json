Whoever said Disney World is the happiest place on earth probably hasn’t visited Lambeau Field before. Last Sunday, I spent the afternoon with 78,434 members of my Packers family at the team’s historic stadium. It was my second time attending a game at Lambeau field, but it felt like my first. I’m not sure if it was my discovery of a bratwurst with pulled pork on top, the thousands of high-fives I received from strangers or just knowing how much history that has touched this iconic stadium. All I know is it had a different feel to it than any other sporting event I have ever attended. Although the game was incredible, my trip started with a tour of Lambeau the day before the Packers took on the San Diego Chargers. The first thing I noted was the variety of fans touring the stadium that included Vikings fans, Bears fans and Lions fans. It seems like as much as you hate a certain team, it’s hard for anyone to deny the magic that is Lambeau Field. Sadly, I was joined on the tour by a Cowboys fan and a Jets fan (my two friends), but I guess I was the one that invited them. On the tour we were able to go into a suite, walk out through the same tunnel the Packers’ players do for every home game and walk out along the field. The one thing I was waiting to do was Lambeau Leap, but sadly that was banned after a lady hurt her ankle doing it a couple of years before (She had to ruin it for the rest of us). While walking through the tunnel, all I could think about was the amount of history that had taken place along those walls, over the brick walkway and through that opening. Guys like Don Hutson, Ray Nitschke, Reggie White, Brett Favre and Donald Driver all walked through the same tunnel I was walking out of. It’s an experience I will never forget and I recommend every football fan take advantage of the tour that’s offered seven days a week. The tour was enough to make my 13-hour drive worth it, but then came the game on Sunday. If you’re sitting in a majority of the seats at Lambeau, you might confuse it with a high school stadium. Bleachers covered by little seat numbers surround the field, so you find yourself real cozy with the people next to you. The close proximity to everyone ended up not mattering, as most of us were standing for a majority of the game. The “don’t talk to strangers,” advice your parents used to tell you goes out the door when it comes to Lambeau. I’ve never seen so many strangers high five, fist bump, hug or even chest bump in my life. I never believed people when they would say Lambeau is an environment unlike any other, but it is certainly true. With lots of Chargers fans attending the game, I expected plenty of fights and yelling. It seemed like there was plenty of joking around, but nothing like I’m used to from attending New York Yankees or Giants games. This experience was one I’ll remember for the rest of my life and is a must for even the casual football fan. If you do decide to make the trip and want to avoid headaches, Chicago traffic and junk food, I do advise flying over driving. The long drive home was certainly easier knowing the Packers were 6-0 after a 27-20 win over the Chargers. I considered myself a pretty avid fan of the cheeseheads before this trip, but I think my fanhood was taken to a whole new level. If I didn’t love the Green Bay Packers before, I can certainly say they have my heart now. Go Pack Go!
