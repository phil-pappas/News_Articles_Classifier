We’re like a family.” \nA common challenge among international student-athletes at LSU is handling the climate. Coming from Hungary, a country located in central eastern Europe, Csonka is anything but used to humidity and temperatures of 80 or more degrees in October. \n“I was struggling a lot in the beginning,” Csonka said. “I would be out of breath after the first 30 minutes of practice, but I feel like I’m getting used to it.” \nHe said he feels the pressure and high expectations attached to his phenomenal freshman season but doesn’t want to set any expectations for his first year in a Tiger uniform. Rather, he wants to keep doing his best. \nHaving started the season with a doubles win over former No. 2 ranked Luca Corinteli and his partner J.C. Aragone from the University of Virginia, Csonka proved himself to both the team and at the Southeastern Conference level. \n“He is used to winning matches, and having seen him playing in the fall, you can already see why,” said LSU coach Jeff Brown. “He’s a very tough player to beat and break down. As his fitness is improving, he’s going to make it even tougher for opponents.” \nCsonka’s big serve, left hand and dominant forehand distinguishes him from most players, Brown said. Even though Csonka is 5-foot-10, he has the ability to serve as powerfully as taller players. \n“He can make a match very physical,” Brown said. “If he’s also in better shape than his opponent, it’s going to be a really tough situation for them to walk on the court thinking they can play their normal style of game.” \nCsonka said LSU’s team was the deciding factor in his recruiting process. After he practiced and lived with them for two months, he’s already found his place on the team. \nSo far, he’s only played doubles with Swedish LSU sophomore Simon Freund. Seeing success against tough opponents, they plan to grow as partners as the fall season progresses. \n“There is something to the European connection they share on a chemistry level,” Brown said. “We’ll see if the Swedes and the Hungarians keep it going.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:23:37.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
