(AP) â€” A Massachusetts family has been searching in vain for its \"slightly sinister\" statue of Ronald McDonald , which was taken from their summer home during a teenage house party.\nMary Ryan tells the Daily Hampshire Gazette ( http://bit.ly/1PyDJUg ) that the three-foot-high statue of the fast food pitchman was taken in August, when her daughter hosted an unauthorized party at the house in Leverett.\nRyan says two boys put the statue in a tree at an athletic club. Someone later took it out of the tree and posted a photo of it on Instagram next to a trash bin.\nThe statue hasn't been seen since.\nRyan and her husband, an artist, bought the statue years ago for $1,200. Ryan says it has a \"slightly sinister quality.\"\nThey're offering a $300 reward.\nThe daughter was punished with extra chores.\n___\nInformation from: Daily Hampshire Gazette (Northampton, Mass.), http://www.gazettenet.com", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://bit.ly/1PyDJUg", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:19:58.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
