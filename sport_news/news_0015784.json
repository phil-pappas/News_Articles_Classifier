But when a staffer went to re-stock it, everything was either uneaten or not opened, and most of the fruits and vegetables had to be thrown out. His room service bill was full of junk food and pitchers of Shirley Temples, his drink of choice. At least it’s non-alcoholic. Before and after games, he was seen chowing down on chicken fingers and hot dogs.\nThat’s not even the worst of it. The report states Embiid has physically threatened the team’s strength coach, refused to wear a walking boot and delayed his second foot surgery a month so he could be in Las Vegas to party during the NBA Summer League. He was sent home from a West Coast trip last year because of his attitude.\nEmbiid was a risk entering the 2014 NBA Draft, because of foot and back problems. He has yet to play a game and has been all but ruled out this season following another foot surgery.\n  joel embiid ,  nba ,  philadelphia 76ers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:46:50.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
