Montiel, a former three-weight world champion, required a knock-down but, like Selby, looked ready to leave the judges to deliver their verdict. \nThe score from the first two judges looked distinctly generous, with the third decision better reflecting a contest Selby was glad to get out of the way. \nIt meant the first defence of the title he won in London in May, beating Russian Evgeny Gradovich, was secure.
