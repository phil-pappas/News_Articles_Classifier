Mike Pooley said. “When they got on scene, three jumped into the water immediately. One of the fishermen also jumped into the water.”\n“It’s absolutely heartbreaking,” he added at a Monday press conference . “(Glenn) Baxter took deliberate action driving into that lake. It is obvious he did that.”\nThe police believe this was a murder-suicide because surveillance video shows Glenn Baxter getting out of the vehicle for a moment to inspect the barriers on the edge of the lake, a barrier he would smash into moments later, killing all passengers.\nThe parents and the two younger children were taken to the hospital, where they were all pronounced dead.
