Being a bruiser and knowing how to throw a few punches isn’t enough. This breed is a trash-talker, an instigator, a troll whome you expect to spark trouble on the ice without even having to drop his gloves.\nTo be clear, 'irritating' is not the same 'disliked'. The internet is flush with list-type articles of the “NHL’s Most Hated Players,” although they mostly consist of players who are beloved by the fan base they serve while being despised outside of that bubble. Outside the Penguins’ fan community, Sidney Crosby is widely seen a whiner. Outside of Montreal, P.K. Subban has been accused of “disrespecting the game.” Raffi Torres has been labeled as a “head hunter” by just about every corner of the continent. Alex Ovechkin is seen as, well, a jerk.\nThis is a bit different from those lists.\nHere, we take a gander at a group of players whose behavior makes them a bit more widely dislikable, whether it is because of annoying childish acts, an inability to accept blame, or simply not being able to curtail their bad behavior.\nHere is a look, in no particular order, at eight of the most irritating players in the NHL.\nCorey Perry\nA favorite description of the Ducks’ forward pinned him as “that kid on the playground who pulls your ponytail then laughs at your anger.” It’s true—he isn’t so much of an agitator as he is a schoolyard bully. He goes out of his way to irk the opposition, but his tactics are a little immature. Perfect example: Grabbing Alex Semin’s stick as if he were a high school senior shoving a freshman into an open locker.\n© Jean-Yves Ahern-USA TODAY Sports Sep 28, 2015; Quebec City, Quebec, CAN; Montreal Canadiens right wing Alexander Semin (13) celebrates his goal against Pittsburgh Penguins during the first period at Videotron Centre. Mandatory Credit: Jean-Yves Ahern-USA TODAY Sports Alexander Semin\nThere is no denying Semin’s hockey skill. But his habit of playing down and exuding a sense of laziness is annoying to watch. Plus his apathy has aided in branding him as what CBS Sports called a “coach-killer.” If he doesn’t up his game in this one season with the Montreal Canadiens, he is going to be branded as “lazy” for the rest of his days in the league.\n© Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports Pittsburgh Penguins center Maxim Lapierre (40) watches his team take on the Dallas Stars at the American Airlines Center. The Stars defeated the Penguins 2-1. Max Lapierre\nIt doesn’t matter what team he’s playing on, Lapierre is a sneaky player with a has a habit of getting into trouble and and playing the victim. Faking an injury in order to draw a penalty during last year’s playoffs is only the tip of the iceberg with the defenseman, who has a long history of irking the opposition.\n© Harry How/Getty Images Dustin Brown #23 of the Los Angeles Kings celebrates his double overtime game winner against the New York Rangers during Game Two of the 2014 NHL Stanley Cup Final at the Staples Center on June 7, 2014 in Los Angeles, California. Dustin Brown\nBrown is a thorn in the side mostly because he gets away with so many questionable hits. The NHL Department of Player Safety doesn’t seem to notice when he headbutts opposing players in the face. As long as he isn’t getting so much as a slap on this wrist, the Kings’ captain is probably going to keep injuring other players without any repercussions.\n© Damian Dovarganes/AP Photo New Los Angeles Kings forward Milan Lucic takes questions from members of the media in El Segundo, Calif., Saturday, July 11, 2015. The Boston Bruins traded Lucic to the Los Angeles Kings on June 26, for defenseman Colin Miller, goalie Martin Jones and the 13th pick in the NHL draft. Milan Lucic\nAnother guy with a laundry list of questionable behavior. In his first contest with the LA Kings, he charged at Sharks forward Logan Couture during a line change, making a bee-line for the visitor’s bench. The move earned him a match penalty, to which he later told the LA Times he didn’t this he deserved and “if my intentions were to hurt him, I would have hurt him.” Just own up to your mistakes, already.\n© (AP Photo/Joe Mahoney Colorado Avalanche center Cody McLeod, left, fights with Dallas Stars' Antoine Roussel (21) in the first period of an NHL hockey game Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015, in Denver. (AP Photo/Joe Mahoney) Cody McLeod\nIt’s an understatement to that the Avs winger has a rep for being a major trash talker. He is arguably one of the most mic’d up players out there, particularly because smack talk is a blood sport for him. It’s at the point where his jawing is tiresome.\n© AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar Pittsburgh Penguins' Phil Kessel (81) questions an offsides call during the third period of an NHL hockey game against the Toronto Maple Leafs in Pittsburgh Saturday, Oct. 17, 2015. The Penguins won 2-1. Phil Kessel\nThere’s nothing more agitating than a gifted athlete with an attitude problem. It didn’t help that there was constantly a microphone in his face at the tail end of his time with the beat-up Toronto Maple Leafs, catching every ungraceful comment he ever made. The jury is still out on whether he’ll still be “that guy” now that he is with the Penguins.\n© Timothy T. Ludwig Oct 18, 2014; Buffalo, NY, USA; Boston Bruins left wing Brad Marchand (63) against the Buffalo Sabres at First Niagara Center. Brad Marchand\nThere is arguably nobody that plays the villain better than Marchand, and he’s good at it. Heck, he started a fight during practice with his own team. The Bruins have spent years having to acknowledge that they don’t like his antics, and he probably isn’t curtailing his behavior any time soon. Love him or hate him, there is no denying that Marchand is a entertaining, if not irritating, character.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://nesn.com/2015/01/brad-marchand-sparked-practice-fight-with-joke-about-torey-krugs-height/", "http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/max-lapierre-fakes-injury--draws-penalty--is-completely-devious--video-135319973.html", "http://milehighsticking.com/2015/03/20/cody-mcleod-vs-corey-perry-most-annoying-forward/", "http://www.latimes.com/sports/kings/la-sp-kings-report-20151009-story.html", "http://www.cbssports.com/nhl/eye-on-hockey/25250199/examining-alexander-semin-the-nhls-most-polarizing-player", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:43:45.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
