Jared C. Tilton Sep 30, 2015 at 2:14p ET 0Shares \nThe National Motorsports Appeals Panel on Wednesday upheld NASCAR's penalty assessed against driver Clint Bowyer and Michael Waltrip Racing for infractions two weekends ago at Chicagoland Speedway, site of the opening race of the Chase for Sprint Cup. \nThis means crew chief Billy Scott's three-race suspension, which was deferred through the appeal process, will take effect. \nNASCAR said the No. 15 team had parts not properly installed on its Toyota during the opening inspection at Chicagoland. NASCAR decided that the truck arms on the car, which are not intended to be adjustable, were indeed flexible. \nMWR continues to deny wrongdoing. \n\"Michael Waltrip Racing respectfully disagrees with todayâ€™s penalties and plans to immediately appeal,\" the organization said in a statement after Wednesday's ruling. \"MWR has made mistakes in the past, but we feel we are correct in this instance. We look forward to the opportunity to present our case to the appeals committee, and have no further public comment until the process is completed.\" \nBowyer was docked 25 points, dropping him to last in the 16-driver Chase field. In addition to the suspension, Scott was fined $75,000 and suspended for three races, and placed on probation for six months. \nThere is one race remaining in the opening round of the Chase before four drivers will be cut from the 16-driver field. Bowyer is 81 points out of the lead and, more importantly, 39 points behind Dale Earnhardt Jr . -- the last driver currently in position to advance to the next round of the Chase. \nBowyer will need to win Sunday's race at Dover International Speedway to move on in the Chase and remain championship-eligible. \nFollowing is the full statement issued by the National Motorsports Appeals Panel on Wednesday: \nThe National Motorsports Appeals Panel today heard and considered the appeal of a P4 penalty issued on Sept. 23 to Rob Kauffman (owner), Clint Bowyer (driver), and Billy W. Scott (crew chief) relative to NASCAR Sprint Cup Series vehicle #15 at Chicagoland Speedway.
