I been thinking more and more about it and I want to have my family close to me. They have been at every single sports event - whether it's three hours away, six hours away - they have been to every one of them since I started playing and I want that to continue here as I play in college.\" Although staying near home to play college football had been on the New Hanover pass catcher's mind for quite some time, the final decision came a few days ago.\"Probably last weekend when I made it final in my mind,\" Walston revealed.Walston called and notified the Georgia staff before publicizing his decision.\"They said they understand and wished me the best of luck,\" Walston responded. \"They said they kind of saw it coming when I did not sign the early enrollee papers a while back but that's about all they said.\"The Bulldogs have two young talented tight end's in Jeb Blazevich and Jordan Harris and arguably lead for the nation's No. 1 tight end prospect in Isaac Nauta. Was depth at the position a concern?\"No sir, it was just me being closer to home,\" Walston replied. \"It was a family decision.\"Having eschewed singing financial aid papers with Georgia, the North Carolina native showed little hesitation when it came to the Tar Heels.\"I already have,\" Walston said. \"I signed them today.\"The relationship with the North Carolina coaches was another aspect that helped with the flip.\"I have great relationship with Coach [Seth] Littrell , the offensive coordinator and tight ends coach,\" Walston said. \"He never really stopped recruiting me since the day I committed and we got along great from the get go. Coach [Larry] Fedora is a great guy. At first we did not talk a lot but starting in March we started talking a lot and here lately we have talked a lot more. He is a great guy.\"With the commitment and the papers turned in, is the recruiting process now final for Walston?\"I am done, I am going to take my official visit to North Carolina on November 14th for Miami game,\" Walston said.
