If we come and play an 'A' game we will put [these teams] in some uncomfortable spots.' \nPompton Lakes head girls' soccer coach \nTom Clarke \nPOMPTON LAKES - A lack of offensive firepower came back to haunt the Pompton Lakes girls soccer team as a 1-0 loss to Glen Rock on Thursday snapped the Cardinals four game winning streak. \n\"As a team we're disappointed in the result, but I know that the girls of Pompton Lakes will always play at their best in big matches. Today I thought we played a 'B' game and we were still there,\" said Pompton Lakes Head Coach Tom Clarke. \nThe Cardinals struggled to muster up any offense against a stifling Glen Rock defense that allowed just three shots on goal for the game. Down 1-0 with less than a minute to play Pompton generated their best scoring chance of the game when a pass was kneed into the Glen Rock goaltender to preserve the teams second consecutive victory over Pompton Lakes. \n\"There was a couple that slid across the goal and our positioning was off. We were slightly off today,\" said Clarke of his team's missed opportunities. \nGlen Rock made the most of their many opportunities outshooting the Lady Cardinals 14-3 for the game. Capitalizing off of a mismatch due to faster forwards Glen Rock's Olivia Trapagan drilled home a rebound in the 48th minute for the game's decisive blow. \n\"There was a counter, we tried to delay. The girl had a nice cross and our goalkeeper did exactly what she was taught to do and she came out and got a piece of it or else [the first shooter] would have scored on a volley and again they just had a player in a good position in the right spot and they finished,\" said Clarke. \nA sole bright spot for Pompton Lakes in their defeat was the impressive performance of goaltender Daniella Lucca. Lucca was an anchor for the team collecting 12 saves on the game and facilitating the offense from the back end. Her big game performance is no surprise, however to her coach who has come to expect that from his senior netminder. \n\"Daniella is a real quality keeper and in big games we know that she's going to give us a great performance,\" said Clarke. \nThe loss drops Pompton Lakes to 7-3-1 on the season. They will have to regroup pretty quickly as they have a tough schedule ahead. \n\"That's the fun part is being the underdog [when] there's no pressure on us. If we come and play an 'A' game we will put [these teams] in some uncomfortable spots,\" said Clarke.
