He might also add 'part-time receiver' to his resume at some point this season.\n\"That's definitely something we've talked about and are going to explore,'' said offensive coordinator John DeFilippo.\nIn the meantime, Gilbert -- who set an Oklahoma State record with six kickoff returns for touchdowns -- has carved out a niche for himself with that chore while he slowly works his way onto the field on defense. During Sunday's 30-27 loss in San Diego, he excelled on kickoff returns, returning three for an average of 36.7 yards, with a long gain of 38.\nThe 38-yarder, from 5 yards deep in the end zone, came with 7:26 left in the game and the Browns trailing 27-19. It led to Josh McCown's 1-yard touchdown pass to Gary Barnidge and two-point conversion pass to Taylor Gabriel that tied the game at 27 with 2:09 remaining.\n\"He's going to be our guy back there,'' said special teams coordinator Chris Tabor. \"He's doing a nice job for us. I was really pleased with how he hit the ball up in there. I thought his vision was good, his ball security was good. That's a nice step for Justin.''\nTabor praised the 2014 No. 8 overall pick for other plays on special teams, including a fine block on Travis Benjamin's 31-yard punt return in the third quarter. The return started the Browns at their 38 and led to a field goal that pulled them to within 20-19 with 9:57 left in the game.\n\"The guy that really sprung it, started it, was Justin,'' said Tabor. \"And he also had a tackle on the kickoff. I thought he played well, he set a bar for himself and hopefully this week we can increase that.\"\nPettine agreed that the Gilbert, who's struggled with injuries this season and was involved in a road rage accident, could possibly be used in some capacity on offense.\n \"He's shown that (he's good with the ball in his hands), certainly, with the kickoff returns the other day,'' said Pettine. \"Sometimes, with numbers and injuries, we've had to throw him on offense at wide receiver and doesn't look out of place. Just given the depth we have at that position now and you add Duke (Johnson), who has wideout type ability, you have (Rob) Housler, who has wideout type ability in certain situations, it's hard to justify it.\n\"(But) he's certainly shown the ability when he has the ball in his hands, he can do something with it.\"\nOn the other side of the ball, Gilbert got only eight snaps on defense in San Diego -- his first of the season -- despite the fact Haden was a last-minute scratch with his broken finger. Pierre Desir started in Haden's place and Johnson Bademosi got the bulk of work -- 65% of the snaps -- as the third corner.\nBut defensive coordinator Jim O'Neil explained that Gilbert backed up Tramon Williams all week in the slot and that Bademosi backed up both outside corners. When Haden couldn't play, they stuck with the plan to roll Bademosi in on the outside in sub-defenses. Gilbert trotted out for eight plays before they went back to Bademosi.\n\"We wanted to give Justin a couple series just to see where he's at,'' said Pettine. \"We just felt more comfortable with Badi just because he had gotten all the reps. And Badi did a great job when he was in there. Badi was playing well. He was playing well against a pretty good receiver.\"\nO'Neil stressed that he'll need all of his corners this season and that Gilbert will play.\n\"They all play huge roles for your football team at some point in the season,'' he said. \"He's had three great weeks of practice. He really battled through the (strained hip flexor) which could've been a major setback for him. I thought it showed some toughness when he was up for us for the Oakland game, even with him being a little hurt. He did a good job on special teams returning kicks, so I like the direction he's going.\"\nThe Browns weren't the only ones that felt like Gilbert had tremendous potential coming out of Oklahoma State. Here's what NFL.com analyst Bucky Brooks wrote about Gilbert at the NFL combine in 2014:\n\"The Jim Thorpe Award finalist cemented his status as the premier corner in the 2014 class with his spectacular showing at the combine. Gilbert recorded the fastest time of the day in the 40-yard dash (4.37 seconds) while also showing impressive explosiveness with a 35.5-inch vertical and 10-foot-6 broad jump.\n\"Those traits were on full display when Gilbert dazzled during positional drills: He looked fluid in his transitions and turns while also exhibiting a quick and efficient backpedal. Gilbert flashes natural hands and awareness tracking balls down the field, validating his reputation as a playmaker. With teams desperately seeking big, athletic corners with ball skills, Gilbert will enter the conversation as a top-10 talent.''", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:12:49.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
