Posted: 10/13/2015 10:55 AM EDT ASSOCIATED PRESS \nLOS ANGELES -- A fan was critically injured in a fight outside Dodger Stadium following Friday night's playoff game and detectives were searching for suspects, Los Angeles police said. \nThe victim remained hospitalized Tuesday, but few other details were available, including the person's age and gender, said Officer Ricardo Hernandez. \nThe fight broke out around 10:30 p.m. in a parking lot after the Dodgers lost the opening game of the National League Division Series to the New York Mets, 3-1. \nAn argument between fans quickly escalated into violence, Hernandez said. It wasn't clear whether those involved were fans of rival teams. \nDetectives with the robbery-homicide division were interviewing witnesses and reviewing stadium surveillance footage, Hernandez said. Robert Gauthier via Getty Images \nA call to a Dodgers spokesman seeking comment wasn't immediately returned Monday. \nSecurity at Dodger Stadium came under national scrutiny after a 2011 attack in the parking lot on opening day left San Francisco Giants fan Bryan Stow with brain damage. Two men — Marvin Norwood and Louie Sanchez — later were imprisoned after pleading guilty. \nStow sued the Dodgers and their former owner Frank McCourt, saying they were to blame for the attack because of insufficient security and lighting. A jury faulted the team, along with Sanchez and Norwood, and awarded Stow nearly $18 million after a six-week trial in 2014.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:35:20.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
