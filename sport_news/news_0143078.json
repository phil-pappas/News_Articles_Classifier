It looked to finish in third place.\nAt times, the battle descended into personal attacks, with Tory ads suggesting that Trudeau -- with his youthful good looks -- was \"just not ready\" to be prime minister.\nBut arguably, it also gave him time to sharpen his campaign skills, and give Canadians a chance to get to know him better -- his colorful past includes work as a snowboard instructor, a bartender and a bouncer.\nBy the end of the campaign, Trudeau had even lost his voice.\nFormer senior Tory minister Peter MacKay, who did not seek re-election in northeastern Nova Scotia, told public broadcaster CBC the \"sea of change... (was) not what we'd hoped for.\"\nBut \"people were looking for something different,\" he acknowledged.\n\"There's an ebb and flow in politics,\" MacKay added, vowing the Conservatives would be back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:16:40.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
