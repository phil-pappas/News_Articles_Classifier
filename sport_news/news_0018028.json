Tanner Kaspick scored the winner six minutes into the second period when the Wheat King penalty killers created a second two-on-one in less than a minute. After Reid Duke missed on the first attempt after a pass from Kaspick, the 17-year-old winger made no mistake on the second, waiting as Duke drew the Blades defenceman away and then ripping the puck past Blades starter Brock Hamm. \n\"There’s not many times on the penalty kill that you get two two-on-ones in one shift,\" Kaspick said. \"Obviously the first one didn’t work out but on the second one, Duker took the D-man out of the play to open up the shot for me and I just took it. Fortunately it went in.\" \nBrandon (6-1-0-2) opened the scoring eight minutes into the first period when an errant Duke shot bounced off the end boards straight out to John Quenneville, who sent it into a wide open Saskatoon net. \nJust shy of 11 minutes into the second period and about five minutes after Kaspick’s goal, Jayce Hawryluk chipped the puck off the boards past a Blades defender, raced around him and then scored on the breakaway, a goal that prompted Blades coach Bob Woods to replace Hamm with Nik Amundrud. \nLess than three minutes later, Blades forward Ryan Graham scored from the slot on a nice pass from behind the net by Connor Gay, pulling the Blades within a pair. \nBut that’s as close the game would get. \nMacoy Erkamps put a laser of a shot on net from the right point that went over Amundrud’s shoulder seven minutes into the third as the Wheat Kings held the Blades to just three shots in the final frame. \n\"I think it was kind of a typical road game,\" Kaspick said. \"I think it took a while for the guys to get into it in the first but in the second I thought we had a better period and we just kind of kept building on our momentum. Any time you can come out ahead on the road and get two points, it’s nice.\" \nWheat Kings head coach and general manager Kelly McCrimmon agreed that the game had its momentum swings. \n\"I thought we had a good start to the game but as the first period went on Saskatoon outplayed us for a while,\" McCrimmon said. \"The second and third I thought we played real well and got better as the night went on. \n\"The shorthanded goal by Kaspick gave us some a little bit of breathing room and Jayce followed up. I thought because we were playing as well as we were defensively that we weren’t going to need a lot more in terms of offence.\" \nJordan Papirny made 23 saves for the Wheat Kings while Hamm and Amundrud combined to make 37 for the Blades (3-2-3-0). \nAfter the game, the team ate and then hopped on the bus to continue west as it prepares for a tour of the Western Hockey League’s U.S. Division.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T09:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:52:08.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
