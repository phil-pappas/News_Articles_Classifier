Warner could read a defense better when he came to the line than any other QB in his era. Palmer has a stronger arm and a slight bit more mobility. However reading the defense made Warner great but Palmer is just very good. I put in another post that often and nearly every time play yesterday Palmer ignored his secondary receivers and repeatedly threw into double coverage. He often had time to look, but didn't do so. He rarely audibles, while Warner could drive the OC crazy by switching constantly. This has a great deal to do with the coaching staff. This is what the NY staff dumped Warner. The Cards gave him virtual free rein and he used it to take the Cards to the big game. Warner should be in the HOF. Palmer could yet take the Cards a long way, but he must be more consistent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:23:17.815+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
