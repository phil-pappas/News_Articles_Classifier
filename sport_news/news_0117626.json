The FBI and Justice Department, following New York's state attorney general, have begun looking into their operations.\nWhether any of this will discourage anyone who has been playing these games from continuing to do so is uncertain.\nThe lottery has always been fool-and-his-money territory. And if the fantasy sports sites' saturation advertising of recent weeks didn't sour someone on their daily sweepstakes parlays, who knows what will?\nIt's possible the lottery can still sell the pitch: It's been your life's dream ... what's a few more months?\nBut for those who profit from or at least participate in fantasy sports, there's the sobering realization that the real fantasy may prove to be that their game somehow isn't a form of gambling and that ordinary people are on a level playing field in the big sites' daily sweepstakes.\nSome Illinois Lottery players cross state lines for tickets because of IOUs Angie Leventis Lourgos Randall Lobello of Bensenville said he still plans to buy lottery tickets, despite the Illinois Lottery's announcement Wednesday that even more winners will be getting IOUs.\nHe'll just play in another state, one where winnings would be paid out immediately.\n\"I do a lot of traveling; I would just...\nRandall Lobello of Bensenville said he still plans to buy lottery tickets, despite the Illinois Lottery's announcement Wednesday that even more winners will be getting IOUs.\nHe'll just play in another state, one where winnings would be paid out immediately.\n\"I do a lot of traveling; I would just...\n(Angie Leventis Lourgos) Setting aside how one feels about legalized gambling in all its forms, at minimum the proposition must be demonstrably fair.\nIt also must be honest about what it is.\nNevada being the nation's gambling mecca, its Gaming Commission has influence far greater than its jurisdiction in these matters.\nSo there's heft to its ruling Thursday that DraftKings and FanDuel involve \"wagering on the collective performance of individuals participating in sporting events\" and must apply for state licenses.\nTo an outsider, that might seem obvious. People essentially bet the stats of players they select will be better than the players picked by others who have anted up.\nBut this is an unregulated industry that's flourished under an exemption to a 2006 federal Internet gambling law instead classifying fantasy sports as a game of skill.\nBeyond Nevada, five states already outlawed DraftKings and FanDuel. A handful of other states have restricted other smaller but significant fantasy sites.\nIllinois Gaming Board to seek ruling on fantasy sports sites Tribune wire reports The Illinois Gaming Board plans to seek a legal opinion on whether daily fantasy sports websites like those ordered shut down in Nevada violate state law.\nSpokesman Gene O'Shea said Friday the board believes sites like DraftKings and FanDuel are illegal in Illinois.

He says the board will likely...\n(Tribune wire reports) The federal exemption, however, cleared the way for leagues and teams to feel they could partner with these companies, fueling the websites' growth while feeding off the interest they generated.\nFor example, while Major League Baseball has shown little tolerance for gambling, from the Black Sox to Pete Rose, it invested in fantasy sports.\nDallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft did too, although the National Football League, long a beneficiary of gambler interest in its games, has always made a show of disdaining other wagering.\nEven discounting Nevada's ruling, which some might construe as a bid to protect the state's sports book businesses, a growing number of politicians on Capitol Hill is calling for hearings on the sites.\nCoupled with this are investigations into whether employees at FanDuel and DraftKings use proprietary, inside information that gives them an edge. There are also questions about the use of technology to game the system among unsettling aspects suggesting an uneven playing field.\nAlthough the sites' commercials with those big checks tout the opportunity for anybody to win, a Sports Business Daily analysis of daily fantasy sports during the first half of the MLB season found 1.3 of the players claimed 91 percent of available player profits.\nAt least those people are getting their money.\nIt seems wrong for Illinois Lottery officials to continue to sell tickets when they know they won't be able to pay the jackpot until the state legislature and governor clear the way, which presumably will happen eventually.\nThe lottery is never a good bet. But the state is supposed to police those who would dangle the promise of instant riches without available cash to make good if the long shot comes in. It's not supposed to be the one doing the dangling.\nAlas, so reliably desperate for revenue that it's almost a cliche to note it, Illinois is in no position to discourage anyone from wasting money on the long odds of its numbers racket regardless of whether it can hold up its end of the bargain.\nDrug ads have lengthy disclaimers to spell out what medications can and can't do, as well as the likelihood of success and failure, while acknowledging specific potential risks and who shouldn't consider them.\nThat might not be a bad thing for those selling easy money and get-rich-quick dreams.\nWe need fewer big cardboard checks and more concrete checks and balances.\nMargin call: New York Mayor Hugh Grant and Chicago Mayor Hempstead Washburne were among those to speak on the first long-distance telephone call between the cities 123 years ago Sunday. Grant reportedly wasn't one of the New Yorkers able to hear Washburne because of a technical issue.
