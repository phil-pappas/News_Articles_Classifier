This week, against the best defense in the NFL, look for the Tom Brady to come out firing despite the Jets ' star-studded secondary. \nThe latest from SportsLine Week 7 NFL Picks \nRunning against the Jets is viewed as extremely difficult within the organization, sources said, to the point where it could prove counterproductive rather than a necessary means of staying balanced. The sheer size of the Jets front seven, to say nothing of its loads of run-stuffing ability, is seen as a mismatch, and while big back LeGarrette Blount in particular will be used at times to try to bludgeon that front, expect a pass-heavy gameplan even with former Patriots star corner Darrelle Revis on the opposite sideline. \nRunning consistently on the Jets is something of a non-starter, while conversely the team's pass rush has not been very ferocious and they haven't had as many sacks as other elite defenses. \"You have to throw it to even really try to run it,\" is how one Pats source put it. \"You have to spread them out as wide as you possibly can and take your chances there.\" \nNew England feels it can use the screen game as a de-facto running game. With Jets top slot corner Buster Skrine ailing, look for Julian Edelman to be a constant target for Brady in short and intermediate throws that don't allow for sufficient time to get to the quarterback. \nThe Patriots have ample respect for new Jets head coach Todd Bowles and how he runs his defense, and it might require 45-50 passes to win this meeting with the upstart team in a battle of the two best teams in the AFC East. \nTom Brady should expect to make plenty of throws Sunday.
