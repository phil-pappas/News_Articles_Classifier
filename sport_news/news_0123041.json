(AP) — Florida freshman defensive back Deiondre Porter has been suspended indefinitely following his arrest on four felony charges. \nPorter, one of the team’s top special teams players, was arrested Wednesday on aggravated assault charges. \nThe Gators announced his suspension on Twitter, and coach Jim McElwain addressed it on the Southeastern Conference coaches call. \n“He’s no longer with the football team,” McElwain said. “He’s suspended indefinitely for obviously a choice. It’s his choice not to be with us. I’m sure you’ll read about it soon enough. It’s one of those things that we don’t obviously condone. Like I said, it was his choice.” \nAlachua County court records list one charge of aggravated battery (second-degree felony), one charge of firing a weapon into a vehicle or building (third-degree felony) and two charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon without intent to kill (third-degree felony). \nPorter also was charged with property damage of less than $200, a second-degree misdemeanor. \n___ \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:18:02.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
