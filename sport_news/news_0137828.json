Was it discussed it all?\nGo back a few weeks and USC at Notre Dame looked like a midseason game of the year candidate. Instead, the Trojans arrived here with an interim coach, distractions galore and a quarterback officially removed as a Heisman Trophy candidate by oddsmakers.\nThat’s quite a week. Notre Dame (5-1) can only claim it will play the Trojans (3-2) with at least six starters lost to injury.\nIrish coach Brian Kelly probably dreads facing USC, and it has nothing to do with splitting the past four games. Kelly never knows who he is dealing with across the opposite sideline.\nUSC has had four head coaches — Lane Kiffin, Ed Orgeron, Steve Sarkisian and Clay Helton — in the past four Notre Dame games. The Trojans even had four coaches in the past four games at Notre Dame Stadium (Pete Carroll, Kiffin, Orgeron and Helton).\nAnd with Sarkisian gone after only 18 games. USC will likely have a fifth coach against Notre Dame next year.\nLost amid all this are the players. They are used to drama after the 2013 season, when Kiffin, Orgeron and Helton all coached the team.\n“We’ve been through a lot of adversity, and that’s what we do best is move on,” quarterback Cody Kessler said. “We have an opportunity to do something great this weekend. Notre Dame is a great football team and we’re excited to get out there. It’s going to be a crazy game out in South Bend and we’re excited. We can’t wait to get back out there and get ready to go play a game.”\nUSC was originally scheduled to leave Friday for Notre Dame, but changed its plans and departed Thursday night. Why stick around this mess?\nWhen USC has the ball\nIf Sarkisian was not fired Monday, the biggest talking point would be the disappearance of the offense against Washington. For all his preseason hype, Kessler has now become more Rob Johnson than Matt Leinart when comparing him to past USC quarterbacks.\nThe Bovada sportsbook took him off the board this week for its Heisman odds. He will definitely be motivated against the Irish because he wants to atone for last week’s performance against Washington — two interceptions and no touchdowns — and for scoring only 10 points at Notre Dame in 2013.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Notre Dame has the ball\nQuarterback DeShone Kizer was buried behind Everett Golson and Malik Zaire the last time these teams played. Golson transferred to Florida State and Zaire broke his ankle against Virginia last month. Kizer has been more than adequate with eight touchdowns and four interceptions.\nOne thing going for him is a strong running game. Tailback C.J. Prosise has already rushed for nearly 800 yards and has scored three touchdowns twice this season. Despite all the injuries, the Irish are one play away from being undefeated — the only setback being a 24-22 loss at No. 5-ranked Clemson.\nUSC players to watch\nJalen Greene: The converted quarterback could get a lot of snaps with receivers Steven Mitchell and Isaac Whitney out. He who looks good in practices but has caught only five passes.\nDeontay Burnett: Greene’s Serra High teammate, who has one reception, could also step up.\nRonald Jones: Maybe with Helton in charge, the freshman tailback will get more carries the way Orgeron elevated Javorius Allen’s role when he took over in 2013.\nNotre Dame players to watch\nSheldon Day: USC’s offensive line, minus center Max Tuerk, will need to contain the defensive lineman, who has eight tackles for loss, two sacks and nine quarterback hurries.\nJaylon Smith: Linebacker leads the Fighting Irish with a team-high 42 tackles and will probably be blitzing Kessler frequently.\nAbout the Author Reach the author at scott.wolf@dailynews.com or follow Scott on Twitter: @insideusc .\nFull bio and more articles by Scott Wolf Back to top", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/insideusc", "http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/persbilde?Avis=LA&ID=39"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:45:23.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
