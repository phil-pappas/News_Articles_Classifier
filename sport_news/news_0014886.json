On November 21, Isaiah Grubb's shoe and clothing collection become available to the general public .\nHere's more about Isaiah's story and some of his interests that were incorporated in the design of the shoe, courtesy of the OHSU Doernbecher Children's Hospital .\nWhen Isaiah Neumayer-Grubb was diagnosed with a brain lesion at age 7, his parents wanted to break the news to him gently. \"We called it a 'brain freckle,' and told him that we'd heard Batman (Isaiah's hero) has the same condition,\" said his mom, Melissa. \"We said it was great, because it would allow him to be brave and strong just like Batman.\" Brain freckle or no, Isaiah certainly has a super-heroic supply of bravery. \"I was really scared to have surgery, but I have a bunch of people supporting me and I trust my doctors,\" he said. With the scary surgery behind him, this mile-a-minute kid now spends his days playing video games, perfecting his breakdancing moves and, of course, designing one-of-a-kind kicks. Speaking of which: Should you ever find yourself in distress, you'd do well to be wearing Isaiah's Nike Zoom Stefan Janowski. At first glance, it's a basic black silhouette, but when light hits it, BAM!â€”the bat signal emerges. Isaiah's name appears loud and proud on the midsole, accompanied by his favorite power words: fighter, freedom and believe. Isaiah says it's been an honor to design a shoe for OHSU Doernbecher, and hopes people love it as much as he does. \"It's gonna help other kids with brain freckles,\" he explained. \"I made it as cool as possible so that a lot of people will buy it.\" It may not surprise you to learn what Isaiah wants to be when he grows up: the Caped Crusader himself. \"I want to be Batman because I want to save people that need help. If I was a superhero, I would give love to everywhere in the world.\" Isaiah, you're off to a pretty good start. -- Tim Brown | @ timfsbrown", "external_links": ["http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/about/dchf/fundraising/nike-freestyle/isaiah.cfm", "https://twitter.com/timfsbrown"], "published": "2015-10-24T06:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:36:57.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
