The big announcement, which was also the main demand of Netaji’s family that met Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his 7 RCR residence, came from the Prime Minister himself. “The process of declassification of files relating to Netaji will begin on January 23, 2016, Subhas Babu’s birth anniversary,” he said. In a series of tweets he posted on his official account, the PM said he would also request foreign governments to declassify files on Netaji available with them. “Shall begin this with Russia in December,” he said. “There is no need to strangle history. Nations that forget their history lack the power to create it,” he said. While there is no time frame for the process to be completed, the PM’s decision is a departure from the opinion held by previous governments, which maintained that opening the top-secret files could harm India’s relations with friendly nations. The BJP denied any “political intention or motive” behind the decision, terming it the “right of the people to know about Netaji’s contribution to the country’s freedom struggle”—though political observers see more to it. They believe the move is intended to embarrass the grand old party and the stalwarts held “sacrosanct” by it. Terming it a “historic moment”, BJP’s Siddharth Nath Singh who accompanied the delegation denied any politics behind the decision. “Important files related to the country’s history were being kept under wraps (by the Congress governments). The country deserves to know the facts. There was a (Congress-led) government which was spying on the family of Netaji. People should know why,” he said. BJP leaders say information would now be exchanged between the Ministry of External Affairs and other countries to declassify files in possession of their respective spy agencies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:46:40.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
