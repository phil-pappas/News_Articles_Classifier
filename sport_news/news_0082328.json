Management is aware of how it feels to go six years without lifting a major silverware. \n'We have put measures in place to ensure that we restore the club's fortunes in the coming season. Going for quality players demands a lot of cash but management is doing its best in that regard. \n'The supporters' front are also in stakeholder meetings trying to find out how best they can help turn things around this season,' said Opare Addo. \nHearts had made attempts to secure the signatures of big guns like goalkeepers Stephen Adams and Ernest Sowah among others. \nFurthermore, the Phobians are in talks to recruit an expatriate to fill the vacant coaching job, with names like Ernst Middendorp in pole position to land the job. \nBy Kofi Owusu Aduonum Sports News Follow Us There is always some madness in love.
