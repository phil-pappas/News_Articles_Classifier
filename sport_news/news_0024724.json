University President Robert G. Frank has expressed concern over the athletics budget but also plenty of understanding, citing the ever-changing financial landscape in college athletics that has created unprecedented challenges.\nNevertheless, balancing the athletics budget, just like for every other entity on campus, is an expectation, not merely a goal.\nThe department spent $13,666,896 in personnel costs in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015. That was not only an all-time high, but a one-year increase of $802,640. Krebs said the department prepared for just a $600,000 increase.\n“A large part of it had to do with the increased costs in benefits and health care,” Krebs said. “Like any other enterprise in America, health care costs continue to rise.”\nBut another factor was the unintended consequence of what was, overall, a very successful year for Lobo athletic teams, even if the marquee sports of men’s basketball and football had down seasons.\n“Some of that has to do with incentives,” Krebs said. “As we win championships and as our teams have success, we pay incentives to our coaches. Oftentimes that overage (in personnel costs) is directly related to incentives that we’re paying our coaches for success.”\nUNM athletics director Paul Krebs said two reasons personnel expenses went up in 2014-15 were health care costs and contract incentives that had to be paid. (Albuquerque Journal File Photo)\nKrebs told the Journal in July that the department has adopted a different general philosophy for incentives for its coaches. In short, he’s cut back significantly on them, saying the base salaries the school pays its head coaches are among the highest in the Mountain West Conference.\nTo make up for those increased personnel costs, UNM benefited greatly not so much from its football program, but from the new College Football Playoff format the NCAA adopted last year. Based on the revenue distribution model of the new four-team football playoff, the MWC received $23.5 million last year to distribute among its 12 football playing members, an increase of almost $20 million over the $3.6 million the league received under the previous Bowl Championship Series distribution model.\nUNM received $1.2 million more revenue in 2015 than in 2014 under the “NCAA/MWC Distribution” line of its budget.\nTicket revenue, more specifically significant drops in football and women’s basketball, was a challenge to last year’s budget.\nReported football ticket revenue was $1,334,028 last year – a 16.1 percent drop from the 2013-14 fiscal year. Women’s basketball ticket revenue was $313,861 – a 22.1 percent drop. Both of those figures are easily the lowest numbers in at least the previous seven budget cycles.\n“I think you’re going to see that trend reverse,” Krebs said. “During this fiscal year, our football ticket sales are going well and will definitely eclipse last year’s figure. The early results on women’s basketball season ticket sales are going to equal or surpass what we did last year. I think both of those tend to trend based on the previous year, and we’re excited about the revenue in football and women’s basketball. Those are a big opportunity for us to increase revenue.”\nMen’s basketball posted an all-time high in ticket revenue of $4.8 million. But short of raising ticket prices, the ability to improve that figure – which was a 1.3 percent increase over the previous season – is limited. The Pit reached 95 percent capacity for the 2014-15 men’s basketball season and 98 percent for 2013-14.\nThe various state and school subsidies the department received, including $4 million from student fees, did not change significantly from the previous year.\nSince expenses don’t figure to decrease soon, finding new and creative ways to generate revenue – from securing naming rights deals to growing T-shirt sales – remains a priority moving forward.\nOne specific way to address more long-term budgeting strategies was the August hire of former state budget director Mike Marcelli, who will draw a salary of $92,000. Krebs said his hire was “not a correction” of anything going on with the budget process in the department, but rather just an attempt to “add an additional skill set that we weren’t able to have before. Workload issues didn’t allow for that.”\nHowever it happens, Krebs realizes balancing the department’s budget should be the rule, and not the exception, moving forward.\n“We recognize that it’s really important that we be good stewards of our budget – the money we help generate and the money we receive in terms of donations, student support and university support,” Krebs said. “… It’s part of the overall responsibility of the athletic department not only to graduate our student-athletes, be active in the community and win championships, but also to be fiscally responsible.\n“So I feel good about what we were able to accomplish last year.”", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/a01_jd_01apr_krebs-266x400.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/c01_jd_11oct_UNM-394x600.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T07:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:26:48.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
