The National Coordination Committee (NCC), the umbrella body of these associations, has stated that it would not support the agitation. VPS Panwar, chairman of the committee known as the NCC of Ex-Central Paramilitary Forces Personnel Welfare Associations, said, “We want to clarify that as the National Coordination Committee, we have not approved the protest for OROP, nor are we supporting and participating in it because we feel that it is untimely and premature. “Our point of view is different...that we should project this kind of demand at the right time. The demand of the defence forces for this has not been notified. We are trying to convince the other associations that this is not the correct time for you to project this demand.” The National Coordination Committee is an apex body of all the ex-paramilitary force associations -- about 50 -- in India. Its main function is to raise their demands with the government. The committee was set up in January after the Ministry of Home Affairs had requested the associations to create an umbrella organisation which would consolidate their requirements and project it to the government. In a letter to all the retired paramilitary associations, dated September 19 this year, PS Nair, the national general secretary of the All-India Central Paramilitary Forces Ex-Servicemen Welfare Association, wrote that he had suggested to the National Coordination Committee to start a dharna to demand OROP, better pension and other benefits, but the committee had rejected the demand.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:23:21.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
