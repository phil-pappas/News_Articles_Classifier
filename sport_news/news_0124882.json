Confirming the availability of tickets for the matches at Dubai Sports City, DSC General Manager – Sports Business Maqbul Dudhia said: “We are delighted to be linking up with Platinum List and UAE Exchange for the sale of tickets for the Pakistan – England cricket series. “These partnerships are in keeping with Dubai Sports City’s ongoing policy of making ticket-buying as easy and accessible as possible for people across the UAE and beyond. “That theme of accessibility is echoed by the fact that, of the eight match days scheduled to take place at the Dubai International Stadium, four of them are on a Friday, one is on a Saturday and another one is on a Thursday night. “We believe that this will give everyone the best chance possible to watch the action at our world-class venue. “We would urge those fans contemplating buying tickets to do so as soon as possible, especially for the Twenty20 International matches on 26 and 27 November. “Seats for matches in the shortest form of the game have always proved hugely popular at Dubai Sports City with previous sell-outs against Australia, twice, and in every match we hosted in the Pepsi Indian Premier League in 2014. “And the fact these upcoming matches have the added context of coming less than four months before next year’s ICC World Twenty20 in India give them extra significance. “The limited-overs matches will take place under the lights of the Dubai International Stadium’s Ring of Fire floodlights and with the usual, unforgettable atmosphere likely to be generated, it is certain tickets will be much sought after.\" Play in the Test match is scheduled to start at 10am every day with gates opening an hour earlier, while the ODI will get underway at 3pm (gates open at 1pm) and the T20Is are set to start at 8pm (gates open at 5pm). The Dubai International Stadium has hosted international cricket since 2009 and has staged more T20Is than any other venue – 32.
