This is their only meeting this year, now that Valley moved from Group 4 to Group 3, beating Old Tappan twice last year. Their most dangerous offensive weapon is Colin Dedrick throwing to Mike Pimpinella. Joe Williams leads the defense from his linebacker position. With Old Tappan, everyone is aware of Jordan Fuller at WR, DB, and QB. What will be key is their defense limiting the effectiveness of the Dedrick to Pimpinella combo and that's where players such as DE Johnny Piccinich and CB Joe Alsharif play big roles. Lenape (4-0) at Cherokee (3-1), Friday night. This is the first of two consecutive battles with sister schools when they battle Lenape this week. Lenape has become known for their defense, allowing 21 points for the year and seven of those allowed by the offense. The offense is more balanced this year, with passing and running of QB Bryce Long and the running of Joe Kellum. Cherokee comes off a big win over Williamstown, where they capitalized on early turnovers. Their defense has allowed 31 points this year and have pitched shutouts the last two games. They have been led by four year starter Evan Powell at LB and on offense, TE Steve Gervasi has become a good weapon. Westfield (4-0) at Immaculata (5-0), Friday night. Westfield visits Immaculata and won a close one against them last year. They playmakers in QB Zach Kelly and RB Jack Curry. They have allowed 36 points thus far and scored 124. Immaculata has allowed 51 and scored 156, behind the passing of John Phelan and LB Edwin Tavarez is one of the top defenders. Westfield has been quietly putting together two very good years and Immaculata has rebounded nicely under Tom Falato. Manalapan (4-1) at Middletown South (5-0), Friday night. Battle between two of the Shore's best. Manalapan has scored 156 points this year and this year's rushing star is Marcus Salinas. The defense has been helped by the return of LB Lee Maksimak last week. Middletown South has allowed 35 points, only 14 since the first minute of the second quarter in their first game, while scoring 221. The Eagles have QB Matt Mosquera to make things happen and he is also a good kicker and punter. LB/RB James McCarthy is a top player, along with RB Cole Rogers. Elizabeth (4-1) at Phillipsburg (4-1), Friday night. Elizabeth comes off their first loss last week, as both teams only loss comes to Bridgewater-Raritan. Since QB Jaquill Burch was injured, all of their games have been decided by no more than a touchdown. Jahmin Museis their go to player. P-burg has scored 177 points, with RB Manny Romero having a good year behind linemen Matt Yanes and Jim Marinelli.
