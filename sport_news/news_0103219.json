She is also a Hollywood actress on the rise. How Rousey juggles both her UFC life and the bright lights of Hollywood remains to be seen. Ronda Rousey has her priorities straight. In between those two roles, she is also an author and model. \nWith an upcoming bout against Holly Holm at UFC 193, all of her focus (well, most of her focus) has been on defending her title. \nThe camera keeps calling the stunning UFC fighter. Throughout last week, Ronda Rousey was out and about promoting her next match. Her stops included The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon , ESPN’s First Take, and she even hosted SportsCenter , becoming the first-ever female athlete to have that honor. \nUpon each appearance, Ronda Rousey wore beautiful dresses and was all made up. She was accompanied with women’s strawweight champion Joanna Jedrzejczk ‘s appearance on ESPN’s First Take . Jedrzejczk, an entertaining fighter who is stunning in her own right, was nearly an afterthought until the show moderator, Molly Qerim, asked her a question about her vintage staredowns during her weigh-ins. Ronda Rousey’s presence stole the show.

What fans saw was the Hollywood version of her. \nShe is cognizant of this, as well. After she wraps up her UFC 193 fight with Holly Holm, Rousey wants to focus on what she tells the New York Times is her biggest battle yet : perfecting her Hollywood body. \nAt first glance, Ronda Rousey is what many would consider a bombshell. \nShe never disappoints when she takes the red carpet. Always looking her best. During the times that she is at a movie premiere, she is a constant head-turner. \nIs that Ronda Rousey? \nIs that the woman who is tough as nails inside of the UFC octagon? \nWhy yes it is! (Photo by Matthew Stockman/Getty Images Sport) \nShe is highly regarded in the eyes of fans, but she wants to improve on that. \nGaining weight is her true nemesis, she says. Her preferred weight is 148 pounds. She feels attractive at 148 pounds, stating that she is able to choose between having harder abs, or larger breasts. Having both is not an option, she states. \nOne hundred and forty-eight pounds is 13 pounds over the weight limit in the women’s bantamweight division. The fact that she can consistently work her way down to the maximum fight weight is a testimony to how much work she puts in during her training. \nAfter the training is over and the fight is in the books, Ronda Rousey will focus on taking on a bigger foe. Her next opponent is changing the stereotype. Beauty comes in all shapes, sizes, and walks of life. \n“If I can represent that body type of women that isn’t represented so much in media, then I’d be happy to do that. When women say that going on publications directed at men is somehow demeaning, I don’t think that’s true. I think that’s one really effective way to change the societal standard women are held to.” \nIf Ronda Rousey does not beat Holly Holm, her campaign may go for naught. This is something that she knows, and swears it will not happen. According to MMA Junkie , she does acknowledge that the challenge against Holm will be tough. \n“This one’s going to be a much longer fight because she’s a 19-time world boxing champion with 100 percent takedown defense and head-kick knockouts. She’s undefeated and an amazing athlete, and definitely the biggest threat to me, especially on paper and stylistically. \n“She’s the type of fighter you have to be very, very patient with. I feel like she’s going to try to like keep distance and keep far away from me and get me frustrated until the point I make a mistake and she can try to kick me in the head, but it’s not going to go like that – not the way she wants.” \nLack of focus is not one of Ronda Rousey’s weaknesses. She has to maintain her tough persona inside the octagon. \nHolly Holm is perhaps one of the few opponents that Rousey has been very complimentary of. Versus Bethe Correia, she promised to destroy. Miesha Tate has been on the end of some noteworthy verbal jabs. The list goes on. \nUsually, she is talking about how quickly she plans to dominate her foe. This time she expects to be in a long fight with Holly Holm. \nHolm is a natural boxer who has good punching power and reach. The problem with Rousey’s last opponent, Bethe Correia, was her lack of reach. Having reach, or length, can keep Ronda Rousey at a distance. Once she gets close, she unleashes her patented armbar. It is a quick night of work after that. \nRonda Rousey faces big challenges. First, she will take on Holly Holm, then she will take on Hollywood as she perfects her physique for the bright lights. \nWhich is Ronda Rousey’s toughest challenge? The Inquisitr would love to hear your thoughts. \n[Photo by Theo Wargo of NBC / Getty Images Entertainment]", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:17:30.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
