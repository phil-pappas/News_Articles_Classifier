(AP) â€” The less bluster the better in Buffalo. Safety Aaron Williams believes the past two weeks have provided the Bills a valuable lesson on how important it is to keep their emotions in check as they prepare to host the New York Giants on Sunday. Two weeks ago, Williams and the Bills failed to back up their brash talk by unraveling during a 40-32 loss to New England. They responded with a far more focused approach in a 41-14 win at Miami. \"I've definitely got to be smarter and more mature about situations, and try to handle stuff like that,\" said Williams, who was restrained by teammates and coaches after being flagged for an unnecessary roughness penalty against New England. And it wasn't just Williams losing his cool in a game Buffalo was flagged 14 times for 140 yards. \"Sometimes you've got to check that,\" Williams told The Associated Press . \"And I feel this team realized that. And we've learned from it and moved on.\" Williams won't get a chance to play Sunday as he'll miss his second game because of a neck injury. At 2-1, the Bills are in position to have a winning record through four games for just the fourth time since 1999. In New York, the Giants (1-2) are attempting to rebound. They squandered 10-point, fourth-quarter leads in each of their first two games before a 32-21 win over Washington on Sept. 24. \"It's not easy to get over something, and the reason is when you look at how hard your players played,\" coach Tom Coughlin said referring to the two losses in which the decisive touchdowns were scored in the final 80 seconds. \"They deserved to win. That's why it lingers.\" New York will be without receiver Victor Cruz , who aggravated a calf injury in practice Wednesday. The Bills will be minus two offensive starters, running back LeSean McCoy (hamstring) and receiver Sammy Watkins (calf). Some things to look out for: OFFENSIVE SPREAD: Receiver Rueben Randle suggested the Giants might attempt to spread their offense to negate the Bills' pass-rushing threat much like Tom Brady and the Patriots did. That places the emphasis on quarterback Eli Manning getting the ball out quickly. The trouble is, the Bills didn't blitz much against New England in allowing a franchise-worst 466 yards passing. Buffalo adjusted against the Dolphins and finished with two sacks and three interceptions. Manning also lacks mobility. \"He don't run,\" Bills defensive tackle Marcell Dareus said. \"We're just trying to get in his face, confuse him with coverages and get him uncomfortable.\" EFFICIENT ELI: Though Manning made some questionable decisions in the Giants' two losses, he has yet to throw an interception on 108 attempts. It's the Giants second-longest streak to start a season behind Fran Tarkenton (163 attempts in 1969) SITTING SHADY: The Bills don't expect their running attack to lose a step without McCoy, who has been nagged by the injury since training camp. Rookie fifth-rounder Karlos Williams has been a force with a team-best 186 yards rushing and scoring a TD in each of his first three games. \"The young man has obviously far exceeded everybody's expectations,\" Bills coach Rex Ryan said of Williams. CRUZ LETDOWN: The excitement of having Cruz back practicing this week quickly gave way to disappointment when he left the field. \"We were hoping this would be the week,\" Randle said. \"We don't have much time to dwell on it. We've got to prepare for Sunday.\" Cruz has not played since sustaining a season-ending knee injury on Oct. 12. REMEMBERING RIT: Coughlin is enjoying a homecoming of sorts. He was the Rochester (New York) Institute of Technology football program's first coach in 1970. During his four seasons at RIT, Coughlin would play tapes of speeches made by Gen. George Patton to inspire his players. \"I played about anything I'd get my hands on to try to motivate those guys,\" Coughlin recalled. He had a 16-15-2 record before landing an assistant job at Syracuse, Coughlin's alma mater. He referred to the RIT startup experience when interviewing to become head coach of the expansion Jacksonville Jaguars . \"I said, 'I've kind of done this before.' And they looked at me like I was cross-eyed,\" Coughlin said with a laugh. ___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:44:26.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
