PETERSBURG, Fla. - The Toronto Blue Jays will face the American League West-champion Texas Rangers in the first round of the playoffs.\nGame 1 of the American League Division Series is Thursday at Rogers Centre.\nDavid Price will start for the Blue Jays, while Yovani Gallardo is expected to take the mound for the Rangers to begin the best-of-five series.\nGallardo went 2-0 against Toronto this season and didn't allow a run.\nThe Blue Jays had a chance to earn home-field advantage throughout the playoffs but went 1-4 in their final five games after clinching the AL East, including a 12-3 loss Sunday to the Tampa Bay Rays.\nThe Kansas City Royals, who led the AL for months, won five straight to end the season and earn home-field advantage.\nKansas City will face the winner of the AL wild-card game between the New York Yankees and Houston Astros.\nIn the National League, the New York Mets will face the Los Angeles Dodgers, while the Central Division-champion St. Louis Cardinals will play the winner of the wild-card game between the Pittsburgh Pirates and Chicago Cubs.\nWhoever comes out of the American League will have home-field advantage in the World Series because of the All-Star Game.\nWhile the Blue Jays popped champagne to celebrate their division title Wednesday in Baltimore, Texas needed a victory on Sunday to clinch the AL West.\nCole Hamels, whom the Rangers acquired at the deadline before the Blue Jays got Price, started the final game of the regular season and would be on regular rest to pitch in Game 2 Friday.\nThe Blue Jays have not announced a Game 2 starter, though the decision would seem to come down to Marcus Stroman or Marco Estrada.\nGeneral manager Alex Anthopoulos said the Blue Jays wouldn't decide based on who'd be better to pitch at home but rather, \"Who's our best option to win that game.\"\nWhichever pitcher doesn't get that start will likely go in Game 3 on Sunday, Oct. 11 at Globe Life Park in Arlington.\nKnuckleballer R.A. Dickey would figure to start Game 4 Oct. 12, if necessary, with Price lined up for Game 5 on Oct. 14 if it's required.\n---\nFollow @SWhyno on Twitter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:23:49.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
