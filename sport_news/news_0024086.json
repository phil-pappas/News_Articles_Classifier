Each, however, is listed on top of their respective positions on the official depth chart released Tuesday evening.\nA weekly disclaimer: Oregon (3-3, 1-2) uses its depth chart as a reflection of the previous game, rather than as a nod toward the lineup to come, and as such telegraphs its positional availability only in rare instances. Which is why Charles Nelson's debut at safety last week in a 45-38, double-overtime loss to Washington State was not shown prior to the defeat, but is now listed afterward.\nHis role as starting safety — the sophomore, who finished with a team-high 12 tackles against WSU — is officially listed as a toss-up between Nelson and Daniels this week, and that alteration is the lone switch from Oregon's l ast depth chart . Nelson also remains listed as a starting receiver.\nOregon's depth chart ahead of Washington pic.twitter.com/ThlcJb40l8\n— Andrew Greif (@AndrewGreif) October 14, 2015\nReceiver Darren Carrington isn't listed at any of Oregon's three backup receiver positions, though he is eligible to play after his NCAA suspension lapsed prior to last week's game against the Cougars. He did not dress nor play, however, two weeks after being cited for an alcohol violation while underage.\nThough true freshman speedster Taj Griffin has been the beneficiary of a larger role since the calendar hit October, he remains third at running back, behind starter Royce Freeman and Kani Benoit. Griffin, whose first career start came at Colorado on Oct. 3, has averaged 9.36 yards per carry and 13.6 yards per catch in the past two games.\nAn \"OR\" remains listed next to the names of quarterbacks Vernon Adams Jr., Jeff Lockie and Taylor Alie. Adams has not played in the last two games, and was pulled early in a third, against Utah on Sept. 26. But his past success at Husky Stadium is notable, even if it comes from a small sample size: His seven passing touchdowns thrown last season are an ignominious UW record.\n— Andrew Greif\nandrewjgreif@gmail.com\n@andrewgreif", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AndrewGreif/status/654090953968365568", "http://t.co/ThlcJb40l8"], "published": "2015-10-14T02:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:14:51.427+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
