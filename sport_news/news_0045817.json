Coupled with his 30th homer, which he hit Wednesday night, Abreu did something only one other major-league player has accomplished in his career.\nHe and three-time National League MVP Albert Pujols are the only players to record 30-plus homers and 100-plus RBIs in each of their first two major-league seasons.\n\"It's a big honor to see my name now along with Albert,\" Abreu said through a team interpreter. \"He's one of the greatest players in the history of baseball, and now to have the opportunity to see my name along with his name is a big honor for me.\"\nAbreu is one of the few Sox players to maintain steady production throughout this season, and he totaled six homers and 19 RBIs in both August and September to put him in position to complete the feat with two RBIs Thursday.\nAbreu said he had been thinking about the numbers nearly every time he stepped to the plate, even though he tried not to. Sox manager Robin Ventura said he knew Abreu was relieved.\n\"He was really grinding for it,\" Ventura said. \"â€¦Guys count on numbers and things like that, and for him, it's special.\"\nThat Abreu matched Pujols' feat was even more meaningful to the Sox slugger.\nAbreu called Pujols a \"huge factor in my success\" after receiving advice from him when he first became a major-leaguer in the spring of 2014. Abreu then hit .317 with 36 homers and 107 RBIs to be named American League Rookie of the Year. He said he planned to text Pujols later Thursday night to say thanks.\n\"All the guys are proud of him,\" Ventura said. \"It's special for a guy to be able to do that, and there's not a big list. This game has been around a long time and for somebody to accomplish that just shows his character and dedication.\"\nckane@tribpub.com\nTwitter @ChiTribKane\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Baseball Jose Abreu Albert Pujols Chicago White Sox Robin Ventura MLB Most Valuable Player Award", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560e1063/turbine/ct-jose-abreu-30-100-white-sox-spt-1002-20151001"], "published": "2015-10-02T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:05:01.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
