If you can run the ball and play defense like Alabama did against Texas A&M, you can walk into a hostile environment like Kyle Field and take control of a big game against a dangerous team from the very first possession.\nKEY MOMENT\nA&M had cut the Alabama lead to 34-23. Alabama punted. A&M got the ball back with a chance to make everyone on the Crimson Tide sideline sweat. Instead true freshman defensive back Minkah Fitzpatrick picked off a pass and took it to the house for the second time in the game. Ballgame.\nWHAT FANS ARE SAYING\nDerrick Henry is the man. Ditto for Minkah Fitzpatrick and Eddie Jackson. Derrick Henry has no regard for human life. Hope Ryan Kelly gets well soon. Derrick Henry should carry the ball until his tongue falls out. John Chavis is overrated. Kirby Smart is the man. Oh, and fire Bobby Williams.\nCALL OF THE DAY\nFeed Derrick Henry. Lane Kiffin put aside his terminal case of the cutes for the most part, especially in the first half, to recognize that Henry vs. the A&M run defense was a mismatch of Godzilla vs. Tokyo proportion. Henry ran for a career high in the first quarter en route to 236 hard yards on the ground.\nWHERE DID HE COME FROM?\nRemember when the Alabama secondary was easy pickings? That was before Eddie Jackson moved to safety and Minkah Fitzpatrick arrived. Fitzpatrick had two pick-sixes and Jackson added another as the Crimson Tide pass defense outscored the best passing game it's faced this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:34:24.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
