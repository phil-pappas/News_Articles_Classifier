Hunter could get used to this. After three years of being looked at by everybody, to do everything, all the time at Georgia State University, the Celtics rookie got a look he wasn’t used to seeing during last week’s exhibition game against the Brooklyn Nets. “I caught the ball in Brooklyn the other day,” he said prior to Monday night’s preseason game against the Nets at TD Garden, “and the guy looked at me, and I looked at him like, ‘You’re not going to press up on me?’ “I was excited. I was like: ‘This is new now.’ I have to learn where all my shots are coming from. But it’s a different game. There is a lot more space, a lot more freedom.” Hunter has thrived in his relatively small role with the Celtics through the first three weeks of preseason. While his collegiate experience playing for his father at Georgia State consisted of shoot, shoot and shoot some more – often with two or three opposing players chasing him all over the court – his brief NBA experience has allowed him to showcase the smaller parts of his game that have impressed coaches and teammates. “I knew that he had savvy,” Celtics coach Brad Stevens said. “I knew that he had feel. He’s probably a little better passer in small areas than I thought – even though I knew he was good. “His defense – he’s had his moments. His length makes up for any lack of strength that he has right now. And he’s got good anticipation at that end of the floor.” Hunter has already seemingly moved ahead of second-year guard James Young in the team pecking order, and appears ticketed for at least a minor role in the rotation when the regular season begins next Wednesday. Although his numbers – 5.8 points and 3.0 assists in 21 minutes per game entering Monday – don’t exactly jump off the page, the way he has executed the smart pass, been in the proper position on the floor, and made the right basketball decision have opened eyes. “I had to do a lot of scoring in college,” Hunter said. “I am in a more comfortable role now just doing the simple things. The game has slowed down now. It’s something that was overlooked (in college). I just take pride in doing the right things.” If anything, it is the thing that Hunter was most celebrated for at Georgia State – his outside shooting – where he has struggled most in preseason. Coming off a junior season when his averages dropped from 43.9 to 39.3 percent overall – including going from 39.7 percent to 29.8 on 3-pointers – he entered Monday’s game shooting just 7-for-28 (25 percent) from the floor. Page 2 of 2 - “My main problem with my percentages is my shot selection,” he allowed. “Sometimes I will take two questionable ones because I start feeling the rhythm. Then I am like, ‘Oh, the next look I get (from the bench) I am going out for this.’ “I’ve just got to work on that. That’s just the maturity of my game. Technique is always there. It’s just when it slows down (the percentages) will be there.” One thing he unexpectedly got to work on Friday in New York was his point guard skills when Stevens turned to him to bring the ball up in the fourth quarter on a night when Marcus Smart and Terry Rozier were out of the lineup. “It was funny seeing that,” Smart said. “I’ve been playing against R.J. since the third grade and never once had I seen him run the point. That night was good. He handled himself very well.” Hunter said he hadn’t played point guard since he was 12 years old – and doesn’t expect to be doing it much more in the future. What he does expect to do is be a sharp-shooting threat off the bench for the Celtics this season who is always eager show people aspects of his game that they don’t necessarily expect him to have. “I’ve always been that little, light-skinned, skinny coach’s kid,” he said. “I’ve had to have that (chip-on-the-shoulder) attitude out on court.” By Scott Souza More Content Now The Bulletin By Scott Souza More Content Now Posted Oct. 19, 2015 at 8:53 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:36:51.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
