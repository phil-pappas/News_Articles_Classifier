Utah Jazz open regular season, and a flashback to Karl Malone's debut in a Jazz uniform \nSALT LAKE CITY — The Utah Jazz open the 2015-16 NBA season on Wednesday at Detroit, so we thought it would be a good time to look at another Jazz debut — the first game of local legend Karl Malone, who opened his Utah account 30 years ago. \nClick the video above for highlights of the Mailman's first-ever appearance in a Jazz uniform. \nThe Jazz start playing for real when they open up the regular season Wednesday at the Detroit Pistons. After the Pistons, Utah will stay east to take on Philadelphia and Indiana. \nAfter losing four-straight games in the preseason, the Jazz thumped the Nuggets last Thursday to finish 3-4. \nNow they're ready to play games that count.
