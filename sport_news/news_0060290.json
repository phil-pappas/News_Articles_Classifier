New York clinched the NL West title earlier this week, beating out the preseason-favorite Nationals .\nThe Mets sure look like a dangerous October team given their improved offense and enviable collection of power starters. Matt Harvey , one of those power starters, is on a workload limit following Tommy John surgery, as you've surely heard.\nBecause of that workload limit, the Mets will \"probably\" limit Harvey to one start in the NLDS, Mets GM Sandy Alderson told reporters, including ESPN New York's Adam Rubin. \"When he goes out and pitches, the reins will be off,\" added manager Terry Collins. \"We can't pitch him six times.\"\nHarvey, 26, has already thrown 183 1/3 innings this season, five more than he threw in 2013 before blowing out his elbow. He is scheduled to start Saturday's game, so his innings total will increase this weekend. The magic number has been 180 innings -- agent Scott Boras contends Harvey should not exceed that number, though the team has a plan in place to control his workload in October.\nGiving Harvey one start in the NLDS likely means starting him in Game 2. Reigning NL Rookie of the Year Jacob deGrom figures to get the ball in Game 1, then come back for Game 5 if necessary. Harvey is currently lined up to start Game 2 one week from Saturday. It seems unlikely they'd push him all the way back to Game 3 one week from Monday.\nThe Mets figure to use Noah Syndergaard and Steven Matz as their other postseason starters, though Matz has been dealing with some back trouble of late, putting his NLDS availability in doubt. Bartolo Colon would step into the rotation if Matz can't go. Jonathon Niese has already moved to the bullpen in advance of a relief role in the postseason.\nAlderson says the Mets will \"probably\" limit Harvey to one start in the NLDS, which I think is just GM speak for \"we're limiting him to one start in the NLDS.\" Should the Mets advance, it would be almost impossible to limit Harvey to one start in the NLCS unless the series is a sweep.\nThe Mets will face the Dodgers in the best-of-five NLDS. The two clubs come into Friday with identical 89-70 records. The Mets hold the tiebreaker, so the Dodgers would need to finish the regular season with a better record than New York to clinch home-field advantage in the series.\n\nMatt Harvey will 'probably' be limited to only one start in the NLDS.
