Fischer is asking for the public's help in his effort to find photos of the Dunsmuir teams that were part of the old semi-pro baseball leagues that competed throughout Siskiyou County. Comment   Writer Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 8:51 AM Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 8:51 AM Visalia, Calif. Former Dunsmuir resident J.D. Fischer is working on a book on the Dunsmuir teams that were part of the old semi-pro baseball leagues that competed throughout Siskiyou County for a number of years. Fischer, who now lives in Visalia, played for the Weed-Dunsmuir teams in eight different seasons in the 1960s. He is asking for the public’s help in his effort to find photos of the Dunsmuir teams. Anyone who has photos or information is asked to contact him at: jdfrun@aol.com. In information he submitted, Fischer said he has been “reading old newspapers and consulting other sources to write a comprehensive book on the history of semi-pro baseball in Dunsmuir” for the past two years. He says most of his research is done, “and I am currently writing the first draft, which is about 75 percent complete. I hope to self-publish the book and have it out by April.” He now has several team photos from the 1920s, one from the ’30s, two from the ’40s, several from the ’50s, and one from the ’60s. “I have very few action shots but some images of old player passes and scorebooks,”Fischer wrote. “I have photos of when Babe Ruth played a barnstorming game in Dunsmuir in 1924. If any of your readers can help, I will give them credit. They need to be Dunsmuir related.” Fischer reports that games were played as early as 1895 in Dunsmuir and earlier elsewhere. “Leagues started after World War I. Huge crowds saw games in many years, especially in the early years from the 20s through the 50s. Towns that had teams at different times included Mt, Shasta, Dunsmuir, Weed, McCloud, Yreka, Scott Valley, Tulelake, Happy Camp, Montague, Hilt, and other smaller towns and outposts. Klamath Falls and Redding were often involved.” He said good sources of information include the museums in Siskiyou County, the County and COS libraries and the website goodoldsandlotdays.com , which is one of his favorites. “The old ball parks in Dunsmuir, Weed, Yreka, and Scott Valley still have the original restored covered grandstands,”according to Fischer. “There are many interesting stories of old time baseball that will come out in my book, which will list all the players and the years they played. Even though it is about Dunsmuir, there are many stories about the teams they played. (Hilt and Dunsmuir had bad blood).”   Writer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:34:54.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
