Faced with a severe budget shortfall, the New Hampshire Department of Corrections could turn to an unlikely source — the inmates — to fill staffing needs.\nThe department announced this week that it will explore using inmates to conduct suicide watches on their fellow prisoners, freeing up correctional officers to perform more security-related tasks.\n“Right now officers do the suicide watches, but if we can utilize the inmates in these peer-to-peer situations, we can use that officer to man a post,” department spokesman Jeff Lyons told the Daily News.\nRELATED: Jailhouse coffee is not offensive; prison labor is offensive\n“On any given month, we’re down 50 to 60 positions, so if we can better allocate our staff in other functions, we can continue to operate safe facilities,” he said.\nSuicide watches typically consist of an officer checking on an inmate deemed to be a risk to himself every 15 minutes. Lyons said inmates tasked with conducting the watches would not be expected to counsel the other prisoner but would only sit and watch.\nLyons said the inmate conducting the watch would alert staff members if the prisoner under watch begins to hurt himself.\nluoman/Getty Images/iStockphoto The potential change would place inmates in charge of suicide watches on other prisoners. Despite the simplicity of the potential policy, some in the state see it as part of a wider issue.\n“They can’t cover all the cellblocks with the staff they have, and the officers are exhausted,” said Chris Dornin, founder of New Hampshire Citizens for Criminal Justice Reform.\n“That’s the real situation here; it tells you how badly lawmakers have funded our prison system.”\nLyons admitted that the department has exceeded its overtime budget by more than 100% in each of the last two years, and it is “constantly recruiting.” The proposed change also raises ethical and legal questions.\n“The seeds of potential litigation are being sown here,” said Beatrice Coulter, a registered nurse who worked briefly for the department.\nCLICK HERE TO FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK\n“If you have an inmate who is tasked with watching another suicidal inmate, who is going to assume responsibility for those actions?”\nLyons stressed that the policy is still in the exploratory stage and pointed out that the Bureau of Prisons sometimes utilizes inmates for suicide watches in federal prisons.\n“We’re trying to look at what the Bureau of Prisons does and figure out how to adapt their program to our needs,” he said.\ncstoffers@nydailynews.com", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:05:01.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
