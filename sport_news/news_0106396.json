(AP Photo/Alessandro Trovati) \nSOELDEN, Austria (AP) — Federica Brignone of Italy built a commanding lead in the first run of the season-opening women’s World Cup giant slalom on Saturday. \nBrignone led Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States by 0.95, while Tina Weirather of Liechtenstein was already 1.42 behind in third. The rest of the field had at least 1 ½ seconds to make up in the second run. \nBrignone, who finished her run in sunny conditions on the Rettenbach glacier in 1 minute, 10.11 seconds, has finished seven times on a podium but is yet to win a GS. \nShiffrin won the race here last season, sharing victory with overall champion Anna Fenninger. The Austrian has been ruled out for the season after knee surgery. \nLindsey Vonn was skipping the race having recovered from an ankle injury.
