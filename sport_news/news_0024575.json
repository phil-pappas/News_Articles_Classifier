Slovakia lost 1-0 at home to Belarus, while Ukraine defeated Macedonia 2-0. \n\"It's great to finally advance, but we know it wasn't easy,\" Spain coach Vicente Del Bosque said. \"The loss to Slovakia (last year) made things harder for us.\" \nIn the final round, Ukraine hosts Spain, which will be looking for a third consecutive European title in France next year, and Slovakia plays at Luxembourg. \nSpain came into Friday's home match with a depleted squad because of injuries and suspensions, and it only got worse after David Silva had to be substituted early on with an apparent ankle injury. Also in the first half, Alvaro Morata had to leave on a stretcher because of a right leg injury.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:02:52.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
