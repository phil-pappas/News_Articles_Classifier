So, I hope the DA finds as much as the New Orleans police did. So, that being said, I'm still waiting to be completely exonerated.”\nA complaint accused Jordan of swatting a woman's backside, then assaulting her boyfriend at the Republic club over Labor Dday weekend.\nJordan denied the allegations.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
