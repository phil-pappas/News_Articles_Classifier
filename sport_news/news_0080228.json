The Indian captain took out his frustrations on South Africa in the second ODI at Indore on Wednesday by slamming an 86-ball 92 not out as India, struggling at 124 for six at one stage, sealed a dramatic 22-run victory to level the series at one game apiece. \nTwo days ago former Indian fast bowler and now television commentator Ajit Agarkar said “the selectors need to have a closer look at what MS Dhoni is doing, not just as captain, but as a player as well,’’ after the skipper’s poor outings in the two T20s and the first ODI. Agarkar added that just because Dhoni had been brilliant in the past, “it doesn’t mean it’s okay for him to fail (now).” \nApart from his knock that was laced with four sixes and seven fours, Dhoni was also a calming presence on the field when it looked at one time the visitors would pull off a victory. India managed a paltry 247 for nine in its 50 overs with Ajinkya Rahane supporting his skipper with 51. South Africa fell for 225 in 43.4 overs with Faf du Plessis (51) and J.P. Duminy (36) leading the way, while and spinner Axar Patel dented the chase with three for 39. \nMALIK STARS IN COMEBACK \nAfter five years in the wilderness Shoaib Malik made a stunning comeback to Test cricket. The all-rounder tore England’s attack in accumulating 245 to put Pakistan in the driver’s seat after two days of the first Test at Abu Dhabi on Wednesday. Malik strode to the wicket in the third over of the match on Tuesday and made England’s bowlers toil in the heat by slamming 24 boundaries and four sixes in his 420-ball stay before losing his wicket to Ben Stokes. Pakistan also got a century from Asad Shafiq who made 107 in its massive total of 523 for eight declared. At the close skipper Alastair Cook (39) and Moeen Khan (15) played with caution to put on 56 without loss. But England’s batsmen face an uphill task on the third day as the wicket is likely to take some turn. Malik credited his Test comeback to his Indian wife Sania Mirza who has had an amazing year on the tennis circuit winning the Wimbledon and the U.S. Grand Slam doubles titles with Martina Hingis. \n“I think there was pressure on me to also perform as a professional sportsman after Sania’s outstanding success in recent times on the tennis court,’’ Malik said. “Sania has proved to be an inspiration for me in many ways even as a sportsman. After watching her win titles even after battling with fitness issues I was also inspired to match her feats as a professional sportsman.’’ While Malik celebrated his return to the fold another veteran stamped his mark in this Test. The 37-year-old Younis Khan became his country’s highest Test-run scorer during his knock of 38. That took his total past Javed Miandad’s 8,832 runs. And Khan has no intention of putting his bat down for now. \nU.S TOUR CRITICIZED \nShane Warne says he and Sachin Tendulkar want to “create history” by bringing their Cricket All-Stars on a three-match Twenty20 exhibition series in the U.S. on November. When this column reported about the proposed trip a month ago it created a buzz in the GTA as many fans planned to travel to New York for one of the three matches to see the former superstars in action. The other contests are scheduled for Los Angeles and Houston. But this undertaking has come under fire from former Australia captain Ian Chappell who asked why people would want to shell out big bucks to watch players way past their prime. “I’ve always thought that the reason for retiring is that you wanted to stop playing,” Chappell said. He also questioned the ticket prices that range from $50 to $175 in New York and Houston, with the majority of tickets at $175 and $325 in Los Angeles. These prices are of course outrageous for a Twenty20 contest but the Ticketmaster office in Houston says 1,500 tickets were sold for the 41,574 capacity Minute Maid Stadium in the first 36 hours since tickets went on sale. \nSRI LANKA ON A ROLL \nSri Lanka began a new era with a bang. Playing without retired legends Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara for the first time Sri Lanka piled on 250 for two at close of the first day of the first Test versus West Indies at Galle on Wednesday. Opening batsman Dimuth Karunaratne hammered an unbeaten 135 and Dinesh Chandimal was on 72 not out. The visitors, who packed their team with four pacemen and a lone spinner in Devendra Bishoo, must strike early on Thursday or they can expect the home team to put the match beyond their teach.
