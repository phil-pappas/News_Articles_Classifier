Last year Louisiana native David Toms, winner of the 2001 PGA Championship, drew a huge crowd for the fundraiser that benefits the men’s golf program at McNeese.“We had a great event last year and we hope this year is even better,” said Burk.The evening will start with a social at 5:30 followed by dinner at 6. A question and answer period with Daly will begin at 6:30 followed by the live auction at 7. Those in attendance are encouraged to wear golf shirt with John Daly-style slacks.Live auction items to bid on include a round of golf for four with Daly that following Tuesday morning at the Lake Charles Country Club, and a round for four at Carlton Woods in Houston with former Major League Baseball star Roger Clemens, as well as many other items to be auctioned off.Tickets are $125 per person or $1,000 for a table of eight and payment is due by December 1. Sponsorships opportunities are also available for the event. Payment can be made by check (made out to the MAF-Men’s Golf) or by credit card. Payments will not be accepted at the door.Daly is known primarily for his driving distance off the tee and his unique golfing apparel. His two greatest moments on the golf course includes the 1991 PGA Championships, and his playoff victory in the 1995 Open Championship.He finished in a tie for third at the 1993 Masters Tournament while his highest finish at the U.S. Open was in a tie for 27th in 1997.For more information on the event, contact Burk at aburk@mcneese.edu.
