They reconnected in 2008 and since becoming pope, Francis has met Grassi and his boyfriend of 17 years twice, once in Rome and most recently in Washington, Grassi said.\nGrassi, who came to the US in 1978 and runs a catering business, spoke at his home on Saturday.\nAsked what he thought of the pope’s meeting with Davis, he said: “I thought, ‘This is really strange. This is not like him.’”\nGrassi said he told friends they should not rush to judgment and that he didn’t think they had all the facts. The Vatican spokesman, the Reverend Federico Lombardi, declined to say who invited Davis or what the pope knew of her case but such encounters are arranged by the Vatican ambassador and his staff, not the pope’s delegation or the US bishops’ conference.\nGrassi said that after the Davis story came out and he was contacted by the media, he thought: “Perhaps this is the time to defend him. I owe him that as a friend, not because he is a friend but because I know part of the truth.”\nGrassi said “encouraging somebody who is so divisive” like Davis would be out of character for Francis.\n“Here is this guy that is so much into integrating everybody, communicating with everybody,” Grassi said, adding he was “500% sure” the pope did not initiate the meeting with Davis.\nGrassi exchanged emails with Pope Francis, who was then Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina, when the country was debating legalising same-sex marriage, which it did in 2010.\n“I remember reading excerpts from the press saying that Cardinal Bergoglio had said ... things that were extremely negative,” Grassi said. “I immediately thought: ‘This is not like the Bergoglio that I know, not the person that I loved so much when I was growing up.’”\nGrassi said he emailed the then cardinal that he was “disappointed” and “hurt”. A week later, he was surprised to get a reply, he said. Bergoglio asked for forgiveness if he had hurt Grassi and said a newspaper had taken his words out of context.\nGrassi said the last sentence his former teacher wrote was: “I want you to know this: that in my pastoral work there is no place for homophobia.”\nAsked what the pope was like as a teacher, Grassi said: “He came to the class and immediately commanded authority but in such a nice and gentle way, and we knew that we were in front of a great teacher.”\nAt the time, they called him Father Bergoglio, but he had not yet become a Jesuit priest. The future pope taught psychology and literature, encouraging his students to read, and at one point convinced writer Jorge Luis Borges to visit his students and give a lecture.\nBorges was so impressed with the teenagers’ work, including Grassi’s, that he promised that if Bergoglio raised the funds to publish it and found a printer, he would write an introduction. Bergoglio did and Borges kept his word. The book was called Cuentos Originales, or Original Stories.\nAsked if the pope had changed from his days as a teacher, Grassi said: “Sometimes when I listen to him talking on TV I just close my eyes and it’s the same tone, the same voice, the same way of persuading people that he had when we were his students.\n“I mean, the man has not changed. He’s exactly the same person, which is quite remarkable given the world we live in.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T00:21:42.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
