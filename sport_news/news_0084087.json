One Redmond decided to sell.\n“Now it’s an asset that can benefit One Redmond in its move to provide economic development across our entire area,” said Eric Scroggins, the board president of One Redmond.\nThe group had a contract with a developer, but plans fell through. In a second attempt to sell, the group sold the property to Natural and Built Environments, a company owned by one of One Redmond’s board members, Robert Pantley.\nPantley said, “What I said is, if you’re interested in me buying it, you guys all meet separately. I won’t be part of it. And you tell me yes or no.’”\nPantley plans to make a five-story live-work space for artists, with 25- square-foot units and lots of common space.\nMunoz objects to the small apartment-like units and the scarcity of parking to ostensibly promote more use of transit.\nBut moreover, she said she simply would not approve of touching the building in its current place at all.\nOne Redmond and Pantley have said they support the idea of moving the structure to one of two city properties, at a cost of $150,000 that Pantley is willing to pay.\nBut Munoz dislikes that plan, because after the building is moved, it is far less likely to be accepted as a historical landmark.\nPantley expressed frustration that no one from the Nokomis Club reached out to him during the yearlong process of getting the project off the ground.\nBut Munoz told KIRO 7, “I did talk to the CEO of One Redmond on Feb. 28 of 2014, before it was approved to sell it to Mr. Pantley.”\nScroggins with One Redmond said they did not know anyone was interested in preserving the property.\nMunoz has filed two appeals to try to stop the project. The Redmond City Council will hear the issue on Dec. 1.\n“It’s preventing us from having funding and resources to continue our mission in the way that we would like to,” Scroggins said.", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:15:43.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
