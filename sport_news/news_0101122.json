The Lady Bulldogs took the title with an impressive 25-21, 26-24, 25-19 victory in Game 3. (Bob Dungo)\nPlaying with fire in her eyes, Pablo went on to finish with 15 points, including 13 hits, as she beat out Valdez in their marquee showdown watched eagerly by a huge crowd.\nValdez had only 14 points – on 11 kills and three aces – this time as she found NU’s defense too hard to penetrate.\nAside from the team championship, Pablo rewarded herself with a Finals MVP award – her first in three years in the league.\nThe title win was the second for NU after its breakthrough win in 2013.\nTheir inspiring 2-1 series win is likely to give them an additional motivation when they meet the Lady Eagles once again in the UAAP.\nThough NU won again in three sets, it had to dig deeper into its bag of tricks before winning the first two sets.\nNU Coach Roger Gorayeb said their first set win gave them the momentum while the second set was the game-changer as they wrapped the series, 2-1.\nAteneo took Game 1,25-19, 25-13, 25-21, but NU, emboldened by the return of Manabat, evened the series with 25-22, 25-17, 25-17 win.\n“Masaya ako as a coach kasi napag-champion ko yung NU. Masaya din ako para sa Ateneo kasi dati kong mga players yan, tapos kami rin yung nagharap sa finals,” said Gorayeb.\n“Sinabi ko sa mga players ko na i-dedicate nyo yung larong ito sa sarili nyo. Lahat ng efforts nyo, itong araw na ito, para sa inyo ito. Walang makakakuha nito sa inyo,” added Gorayeb.\nAfter a tense second set win, NU looked headed for an easy win in the third after racing to a 9-2 lead.\nBut Ateneo refused to give up the fight easily with Valdez leading the charge to tie the game at 10-all.\nBut it proved to be the Lady Eagles’ last stand as Pablo, Manabat and Jorelle Singh joined hands once again to take control of the game once again.\nManabat chipped in 11 points, while Santiago and Singh added 10 points each.\nVeteran setter Rubie De Leon also played a vital role with 15 excellent sets.\nValdez only had kind words for NU.\n“No excuses,” said Valdez. “NU played perfect volleyball and they deserved the title. It’s anybody’s ball game naman, and we can’t control everything. But we’re happy that we gave them a good fight.”\nNU’s defense was rock-solid as it limited Ateneo to only 27 kills against the 42 for the Lady Bulldogs.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:21:01.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
