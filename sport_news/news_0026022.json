Here's a look at the key to his success. 2 Related \nBradford threw for 280 yards, including a 32-yard touchdown pass to Riley Cooper , but had three interceptions to keep New York in the game. The Giants got zero points off the turnovers. \n\"We were stagnant,\" Giants coach Tom Coughlin said. \"They did more with their opportunities than we did.\" \nThe Eagles (3-3) have won two straight to move from last place in the NFC East into a tie with the Giants (3-3) for first. The teams meet again in Week 17. \nNeither team looked sharp in front of a prime-time audience. They combined for seven turnovers and 21 penalties. \n\"That's bad football,\" Coughlin said. \nWearing all black uniforms for the third time in franchise history, the Eagles got off to another slow start. The Giants gave the Eagles first downs on a roughing-the-passer penalty and a running-into-the-kicker penalty to keep both their TD drives going. \nManning completed his first 10 passes, including a 13-yard TD pass to Odell Beckham Jr . for a 7-0 lead. But things went downhill for Manning from there. \nThe Eagles took a 14-7 lead in the second quarter, when Carroll jumped in front of a pass intended for Dwayne Harris and ran it back untouched for his first career TD. \n\"Terrible read by me. Bad decision to make that throw,\" Manning said. \"I should have gone to my next guys in my progression.\" \nAfter Nikita Whitlock ran into punter Donnie Jones to give Philadelphia a first down at its 28, Murray took over. He had two runs of 11 yards and finished the drive with a 12-yard TD run to give Philadelphia a 24-7 lead in the third quarter. \nMurray had his best game since joining the Eagles after a record-breaking season in Dallas. The All-Pro led the NFL in rushing last year and broke Emmitt Smith's single-season club record but had struggled in Philadelphia. He entered the game with 130 yards this season. \n\"We know we have a long way to go,\" Murray said. \nThe Eagles were 1-3 before a 39-17 win over the New Orleans Saints at home last week. They'll travel to play unbeaten Carolina (5-0) on Sunday. \nThe Giants had won three in a row. They'll host Dallas (2-3) next week. \nBradford had a pair of third-quarter interceptions on poor throws, including one Landon Collins picked in the end zone. But Philadelphia's defense bailed him out. \n\"We need to improve on offense,\" coach Chip Kelly said. \nThe Giants came out playing Kelly's style of football and running a no-huddle offense. They moved right down the field, and Manning connected with Beckham across the middle for a score. \nThe Eagles went three-and-out on their first possession, and the Giants were driving with a first down at Philadelphia's 23 when DeMeco Ryans stole the ball from Larry Donnell for an interception. A roughing-the-passer penalty on Damontre Moore helped the Eagles avoid another three-and-out, and Bradford hit Cooper on a deep pass to tie it 7-7. \nThe teams traded turnovers midway through the second quarter. Malcolm Jenkins forced Rashad Jennings to fumble, and Ryans recovered at the Eagles' 38. But Jayron Hosley intercepted Bradford's deep pass and ran it back to the Giants' 42. \nCaleb Sturgis hit a 37-yard field goal to give the Eagles a 17-7 lead at halftime. He nailed one from 39 in the fourth quarter. \nGame notes Manning is 9-14 versus Philadelphia. ... Manning threw two picks for the first time since the 49ers intercepted him five times on Nov. 16, 2014. ... The Eagles inducted RB/PR Brian Westbrook and LB Maxie Baughan into the team's hall of fame in a halftime ceremony. ... The Eagles are 2-1 in all black uniforms, including a 27-0 win over the Giants in October 2014. ... Giants CB Prince Amukamara (pectoral) sat out. ... Eagles LBs Kiko Alonso (knee), Mychal Kendricks (hamstring) and WR Nelson Agholor (leg) were inactive. 0 Shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T09:51:41.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
