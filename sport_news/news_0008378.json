He just gets you the ball.” \nPeterson was his first target, and the receiver did the most he could with it, taking the ball in right near the line of scrimmage, breaking through a cluster of defenders with help from a David Dufresne block and tip-toeing down the sideline for a 38-yard touchdown. \n“I caught it and kept my feet pumping,” he said. \nThere was plenty of the traditional from the Mustangs, now 4-2 overall and 3-0 in district play a week before a date with Palm Bay. The offensive line opened up enough holes for Merritt Island to control the line of scrimmage, including one that allowed Raleigh Barfield score from the 25, right up the middle. \nQuenton Ashley did what Mustangs defensive backs often do, intercepting a Titusville pass in stride to end the one scoring threat the Terriers managed. He was part of a defense visibly tougher than in the district opener at Space Coast just a few weeks back when the Mustangs escaped with a 27-19 win. \n“We’re really communicating a lot better, one of the things we’ve been focusing on,” he said. Week 8: Friday's high school football capsules \nThe Titusville defense had its moments and twice held the Mustangs out of the end zone. Dante Mitchell broke up a third-down pass in the first quarter to force a field goal attempt, and the middle of the Terriers defense stopped Merritt Island on a third-and-2 early in the second. \nThat just allowed kicker Mason Denaburg to put on a show, first with a 33-yard field goal and then with a 40-yarder that looked as if it would have been good from considerably longer. He later missed a 54-yarder, but only because it bounced off the left upright – two-thirds of the way up – and back onto the field. \nWhen the Terriers left Connor Allen open in the middle of the field two minutes before halftime, it cost them. Batch found the tight end, and it turned into a 56-yard play that set up the quarterback’s own touchdown run, from 17 yards. \nBut the Mustangs weren’t ready for intermission. Despite starting deep in his own territory, Batch engineered a touchdown drive that culminated eight seconds before halftime with a 16-yard scoring pass to Luke Clark. \nContact McCallum at 321-242-3698 or bmccallum@floridatoday.com .
