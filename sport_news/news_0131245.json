He also made an impact in the return game. Advantage Rebels, who are playing Dobyns-Bennett for the fifth time. Maryville has surrendered just 75 points this season, and will be favored to extend its state-best winning streak to 37 games. The Indians, coming off a bye, scraped past Hardin Valley in Week 5, forcing a safety late in the fourth quarter to edge the Hawks.\nPrepXtra Pick: Maryville 35, Dobyns-Bennett 17\nJefferson County (2-3, 0-2 Region 1-6A) at William Blount (2-3, 0-2): Jefferson County and William Blount have played every year since 2009 as non-district opponents, but transitioned to Region 1-6A this season. Both need to finish with a flurry to have a chance to host a first-round playoff game in November. Expect plenty of scoring with Jefferson County’s high-powered passing attack, led by quarterback Austin Jenkins, and the dual-threat capabilities of William Blount quarterback Austin Myrick. Jefferson County leads the series 11-4.\nPrepXtra Pick: Jefferson County 28, William Blount 24\nLast Week: 21-7 (75 percent); Overall: 154-50 (75.5)\nNick Carboni’s Picks: Maryville over Dobyns-Bennett; Jefferson County over William Blount\nLast Week: 20-8 (71.4); Overall: 148-56 (72.5)", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zsJHL-1cUT58.kDuNbtG2FrpQ&z=16"], "published": "2015-10-01T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T13:16:59.478+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
