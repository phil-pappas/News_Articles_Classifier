The following are some takeaways from Saturday's game. Turnovers rule the day \nComing into Saturday's game, both Cal and Utah were two of the top teams in the Pac-12 at forcing teams to turnover the ball. So, of course, what happens when these two teams meet? Madness, that's what. \nCal and Utah combined for nine turnovers, with six coming from Cal and three coming from Utah. Utah certainly won the turnover battle, which ultimately helped secure the victory, but it wasn't their prettiest game of the season and turnovers that were easily unavoidable. \nUtah has played a rather clean style of play this season, but Cal found a way to pick off Travis Wilson twice after forcing passing into tight windows. Utah's third turnover — a Devontae Booker fumble — was rare and avoidable had his knee hit the ground before coughing up the ball. \nIs it cause to concern for either team? Yes, but no. Anytime you turnover the ball it's a bad thing, but both teams have been decent with negating these errors and likely won't replicate the problem. Chalk it up for a physical matchup against two ball-savvy defenses. Utah's defense saved the day \nUtah's defense is one of two reasons that the Utes were able to avoid defeat. Aside from the five interceptions off Cal's quarterback Jared Goff, Utah's defense did a great job of disguising its pressure and coverage packages. Goff was forced to make decisions even quicker than he was used to and it flustered the super-talented quarterback. \nUtah's defense had five pass breakups, five tackles for loss, five interceptions, three sacks and two forced fumbles. But most importantly, the defense locked down when it needed to the most and kept Goff from getting the ball in the end zone too much. Against Goff, it was about minimizing his throws and keeping him off the field. Between turnovers, pressure and pure physical play, Utah's defense was instrumental in Utah's win. Devontae Booker is done messing around \nDevontae Booker never gets tired. He's ready for all the carries the team is willing to give him, and he somehow finds a way to get better each time he touches the ball. He has a way of wearing down opposing defenses with his creative and physical runs. And it was no different Saturday, particularly in the second half as Booker was the star of the show on offense. \nBooker managed just under 300 all-purpose yards and kept Cal's defense running around all night. They attempted to hit him, but he'd push back even harder and with more intensity to beat Cal's defenders. Booker managed a 40-yard touchdown and 222 rushing yards on the night, and yet teams still struggle to contain him. Jared Goff is human … but still good \nUtah has seen some exceptional quarterbacks over the years, and Goff may be one of the best. Last year Utah sat in awe as Heisman winner Marcus Mariota diced up their defense and strolled to a win. But Goff seems ready to step onto an NFL tomorrow if asked. His ability to read his receivers on the field is second to none in the college world. \nGoff's ability to command an offense is incredible, and he does it with speed and ease. Sure, he threw five interceptions against Utah, but he moved the ball quicker than anyone Utah has faced this year and likely will face. Goff deserves all the praise he's getting ahead of an undoubtedly talented NFL career, but it's nice to see even greatness brought back to earth with a few mistakes.
