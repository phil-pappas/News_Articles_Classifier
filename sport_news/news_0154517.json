Brian Ferreira was named the new head coach of the Falmouth girls hockey team on Thursday, taking over for Erin Hunt, who capped her highly successful four-year stint by leading Clippers to the Division 2 state championship last season. Hunt returned to her home state to become the girls hockey coach and a teacher at Shakopee High School in Minnesota. “Just getting back to Falmouth, that’s about it,” said Ferreira, who works for Oceanside Restoration, spending many of his days taking the ferry from Woods Hole to Martha’s Vineyard.“It was a tough decision. I enjoy coaching and want to continue doing it. Being two miles away from home makes it a lot easier.” Ferreira leaves St. John Paul II High School, where he coached for the last four seasons after forming the boys high school hockey program at then Pope John Paul II. The 47-year-old former Falmouth High School standout had two stints coaching at Sandwich High School, for four seasons in the mid 1990s and again in the 2002-03 and 2003-04 campaigns. In between Ferreira helped build up the Salve Regina University from a club program to varsity level and also coached junior hockey with the Bridgewater Bandits. Ferreira also assisted his father, Buddy Ferreira, at Falmouth from 2005-10, before taking over at PJP. Going home and being closer to home made the decision that much easier. After starring for Falmouth under his father, Ferreira was drafted in the eighth round of the 1986 NHL’s entry draft. He graduated from Division I Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1990 and then played for the Maine Mariners of the AHL. Ferreira also played minor league hockey for Johnstown and Nashville of the ECHL, and Fresno of the Sunshine Hockey League. Ferreira takes over not only a team which won the state title last year but has been to the Boston Garden three times over the past four seasons. “I’m stepping in at the top of the mountain,” Ferreira said. “Everybody tells me it will be a tough year but I think we will re-load more than rebuild.“ Falmouth is losing 12 players from last seasons state championship club, including McKenzie Haberl, who is headed to prep school after leading the team in scoring in 2014-15. But Ferreira thinks the successful foundation set in place will be able to be continued. “Girls hockey has grown so dramatically,” said Ferreira. “It’s definitely going to be a challenge keeping the girls in Falmouth. Girls prep schools are where the boys were 20 years ago and there’s a lot of temptation. You have to give them a reason to play at their own high school.” By Paul Godfrey", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:31:21.647+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
