Randy was impressed by the Foundation’s mission and direct support of families in need, leading to PeopleStrategy becoming one of the Foundation’s first Corporate Sponsors,” said David Fiacco, president and COO of PeopleStrategy. “We look forward to continuing our support of SAFF by hosting a charity golf tournament and donating a custom-made “Incredible Hulk” motorcycle as the grand prize for a raffle to be held in conjunction with the event.”\nAll proceeds from the event will go directly to the Scarborough Foundation which has identified Trey Mills and his family as the recipient. Now 4 years old, Trey was born with a rare overgrowth syndrome called Proteus, which can cause differences in the appearance and growth rate of various body parts. In Trey’s case, it has affected the entire left side of his body – inside and out. In his short lifetime, Trey has endured over 400 doctor appointments, 16 sedations, nine surgeries, and had both his left leg and left ring finger amputated. In July, Trey was diagnosed with severe lung disease and is currently waiting to go on the double lung transplant list in Missouri.
