So that’s really a credit to him and how much he’s improved from last year to this year.”\nSo far, his time as a No. 1 corner has had its ups and downs. He allowed completions on 10 of the 11 throws into his coverage in Week 1, but in the three games after that, he let up just four combined receptions on 11 throws.\nAside from his opening day showdown with Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown, Butler hasn’t had any real stiff competition. Week 6 finally changed that, when he had to break up passes from Colts quarterback Andrew Luck while in coverage of receivers Donte Moncrief and Philip Dorsett.\nButler held his own, allowing just seven receptions on 13 throws into his coverage and notching three pass-breakups on the way.\nHe gave up a touchdown, but only by the narrowest of margins, and not without an intense fight for the ball.\nButler was within inches of breaking up a goal-line fade on 4th-and-1 with 7:21 remaining in the first quarter. He might have been successful if he had timed his jump just a little differently. He was successful in making the catch as difficult as possible for Moncrief.\nConsidering the fact that the back-shoulder fade is one of the toughest throws and catches to defend, Butler’s near-perfect defense of the throw is worthy of plaudits.\nButler might have also had his second interception of the season, were it not for Moncrief turning into a defensive back and breaking up the pass. With 4:30 remaining in the fourth quarter, Moncrief ran an out-route 15 yards downfield, but Butler had perfect position the entire time.\nHe ran with Moncrief stride for stride downfield, and as soon as Moncrief broke toward the sideline, Butler stayed with him. He cut off the path between the quarterback and the receiver, and reached up above his head for an interception, but was thwarted by Moncrief’s attempt to pin the ball against his chest.\nButler opened up the game in coverage of T.Y. Hilton, but did not stay there for long, as safety Patrick Chung spent most of the night on Hilton in the slot.\nLuck threw just one pass to Hilton with Butler on him in coverage, and sure enough, Butler was in position to prevent it from being completed.\nButler did a nice job of bumping Hilton off his route, forcing him to run closer to the sideline. He did an even better job of turning into a receiver at that point, tracking the ball in flight as Luck attempted a deep fade to Hilton.\nAll Butler had to do was reach over his head and swat it away, but he wanted that pick. The only reason he didn’t get it was because of Hilton’s flailing hands of panic knocking it away.\nButler would have been an important part of the Patriots secondary regardless of his role, but week after week, he’s validating the Patriots’ decision to put one of the most important roles in the secondary in his hands.\nPhotos: Bill Belichick’s best draft picks\nPrevious -- of -- Next No. 20: Ty Warren, Defensive Lineman, 1st round, 2003 The Boston Globe/John Tlumacki Previous -- of -- Next No. 19: Stephen Gostkowski, Kicker, 4th Round, 2006 AP/John Cetrino Previous -- of -- Next No. 18: Bryan Stork, Center, 4th Round, 2014 Getty Images/Jim Rogash Previous -- of -- Next No. 17: Nate Solder, Offensive Tackle, 1st Round, 2011 The Boston Globe/Matthew J.
