All political parties, including newcomers to Bihar’s electoral scene, cite their desire for development in Bihar as their motivation for contesting the elections. On being asked why his party wants to participate, Owaisi replied that it wanted to develop the extremely deprived region of Seemanchal in north-east Bihar. The Shiv Sena too, with no significant standing in Bihar, is also in the fray ostensibly due to its commitment to the development of the region. Established political parties, national and regional, reiterate their long standing dedication for Bihar’s development at every chance they get. Given the ubiquity of the term ‘development’ in the current political parlance of Bihar, it is imperative to grasp the extent of deprivation in the region. With little industrialisation, 90 per cent of the population subsists on agriculture while Bihari labourers make up the majority of workers in the national informal sector.. State government departments and agencies tasked with the management and development of human resources are often ineffectual and disinterested. The popular acceptance of Bihar’s backwardness is indicated by the fact that since independence every successive government in Bihar has sought either a special package or ‘special category state’ status. Such pronouncements have become a technique for survival in Bihar politics for all political parties and affiliations. Such self-appraisal of Bihar as ‘backward’ leads straight to the question - what should be the cornerstone of Bihar’s development? RJD supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav has already announced that the next step should be Mandal Part II aimed at ensuring honorable representation of both contemporary and historically marginalised castes and socio-economic groups in the state's legislature and administrative institutions. Lalu’s Mandal Part II is a ‘natural extension’ of the inclusive development agenda marked out by Mandal Part I. Therefore, he wishes to repeat history which shows his political glory of recent past. Undoubtedly, when Mandal Part I was first rolled out, Lalu Yadav was looked upon as the tallest leader of all backward castes and groups in Bihar. A quarter century later, his political identity is tied to a single caste, his own. However, it is undeniable that Mandal Part I brought the oppressed castes together to demand their democratic right for active and substantive representation in the political and administrative arena. This itself can, in some ways, be considered an indicator of their development. In the same vein, Nitish Kumar has created an environment conducive to inclusive human development which takes into account the socio-economic context of Bihar. Despite resource constraint and limitations of governance, Nitish Kumar prioritised education and health. As a result, he is recognised as a development icon not just regionally and nationally, but in other parts of the world. Eminent economist Amartya Sen has termed his policies as the right step towards development. Ironically, by election time, Nitish Kumar's views on development were influenced by the parochial politics of identity and simple social arithmetic pandering to electoral dynamics. He notified several castes as extremely backward and assured many communities of treatment equal to that constitutionally guaranteed to tribal communities. Of course, experts can later argue that one often has to take a step back in order to win. It would be relevant here to recall a British social scientist who had worked for a decade in India. He had opined that a key factor in India's lack of development is lack of continuity in development policies and priorities. Under BJP’s leadership, the NDA's electoral announcements proclaim that the one and only issue that need be addressed in Bihar is development. BJP’s national and state leaders believe their win will allow them to tailor Bihar’s development in consonance with the Gujarat model as well as the national plan for development as envisaged by Narendra Modi. A recent World Bank (India) report ranks Bihar 21st in terms of least conducive states for industrial development while Gujarat takes the top position. For the NDA, this piece of statistic has almost become a magic wand for electoral triumph. From 2005 to 2013, the BJP partnered JD (U) in formulating policies and programs for Bihar’s development. This experience is its only political and intellectual capital for the elections. As each nation, state or community develops best in keeping with its specific historical and contemporary contexts, imposing models and examples from regions with differing historical experiences and geography is against the spirit of inclusive development. However, the silver lining is the emerging awareness of the need for substantive democratic participation of Dalits, tribals, minorities and other oppressed and marginalised sections. Though unintentional, the dialogues, promises and controversies which are part of the electoral arena have brought such communities and their issues to the forefront of popular political-electoral discussions. By promoting an egalitarian vision of development and inclusive democratic participation, the current electoral dialogues are grappling directly with the complex issue of understanding the impact of social context and the pernicious effects of a historically stratified society on Bihar’s development agenda. Nevertheless, if post elections, the commitment to development turns out to be empty rhetoric and the centrality of these issues is disregarded, they will come up again during the next Assembly Elections. As is the case in 2015, in 2020, political parties and its leaders will continue to clamor for attention in the name of development and issue much the same pronouncements, condemnations and promises.
