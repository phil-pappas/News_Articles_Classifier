Naz was all over me, I should have got it.”\nSpaling would likely have fallen over the railing of the second deck, where the two Leafs were perched for the game. Replays of the homer show two figures, one in a baseball cap, reaching over the barrier in an attempt to catch the ball. It landed in the first-level seating, just out of their reach.\nThe guy in the hat was Spaling, the guy without one was Kadri.\n“We were right there, Kadri said. “It was pretty cool, we couldn’t get to it (the homer), but it was right there. Maybe one seat lower and we’d of had it . . . Nick almost got a hand on it.”\nThe Leafs were back on the ice Thursday morning for the final of four consecutive practices before a pair of road games this weekend in Columbus and Pittsburgh.\nJames Reimer gets the start Friday against Columbus, where the Leafs will face David Clarkson for the first time since he was dealt to the Blue Jackets last year. Jonathan Bernier gets the net for a highly anticipated meeting with Phil Kessel and the Penguins.\nBut about half the team took in the Jays game Wednesday, including Spaling, Kadri, James van Riemsdyk, Joffrey Lupul, Reimer, Dion Phaneuf, Brad Boyes, and Jake Gardiner and Morgan Rielly. Some were just a few rows above the Jays dugout.\n“Maybe the best sporting event I’ve ever seen, and certainly the best baseball game I’ve been to,” Lupul said.\n“I went to the Ryder Cup in Medina, outside of Chicago, and that was a cool sporting event. Last night (Wednesday) was a great game, but the way it played out, you couldn’t script that. All my interviews now, I just talk about the Blue Jays, I don’t have to talk about hockey anymore.”\nCoach Mike Babcock, for the second consecutive day, began his press srcum with “how about them Jays . . . ”\n“It’s pretty exciting for the city of Toronto and for our players to see how excited the fans get when you put together a winner,” Babcock added. “It was a great event for our players to be at.”\nBut the coach has not taken his foot off the pedal in terms of pushing his team for better execution and overall performance.\nPart of the process has been getting his top centres — Kadri and Tyler Bozak — to study video of two of Babcock’s former charges — all-star centres Pavel Datsyuk and Henrik Zetterberg — who evolved from scoring forwards to award-winning two-way players who could also score.\n“Yeah, for sure, I’ve been watching lots of video on them and you learn from it,” Kadri said. “Datsyuk didn’t know that part of the game at first (back checking and defensive responsibilities as a centre), but by the end he was winning Selke trophies (most outstanding defensive forward).”\nBabcock said the team has to be strong up the middle from the goalie out.\n“But your cente has to be strong, they set the tone . . . sometimes you starve to death if you don’t have your centres doing their jobs,” Babcock said.\nNOTE: Shawn Mathias (shoulder) will be back in the lineup after missing a game. He’ll likely be on a line with Kadri and Brad Boyes.\nMore on thestar.com\nALCS preview: Richard Griffin breaks down Blue Jays-Royals matchup\nLooking back at 1985 Blue Jays-Royals ALCS heartbreaker", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:38:38.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
