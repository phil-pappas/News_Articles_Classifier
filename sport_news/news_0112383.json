His average of 85 receiving yards per game ranks No. 34. \nTreadwell entered this season with 120 receptions for 1,240 yards and 10 touchdowns, despite missing the Rebels’ final four games last season due to a gruesome left leg injury. \nHe made three preseason All-America first teams and four second teams and 10 preseason All-SEC first teams, as well as the Maxwell award and Walter Camp player of the year watch lists. \nHe’s tied for fifth in program history with 13 touchdown catches, is ranked fourth with 155 career receptions and has caught a pass in 28 consecutive games he’s played in. \nTreadwell has been projected by ESPN football analyst Mel Kiper Jr. as a first-round selection in next year’s NFL Draft if he chooses to leave college early. \nDemarcus Ayers (Houston, junior), Shelton Gibson (West Virginia, sophomore), Richie James (Middle Tennessee State, redshirt freshman), Kenny Lawler (California, junior), Gabe Marks (Washington State, junior) and Jordan Williams (Ball State, senior) were also added Wednesday. \nThe Biletnikoff is given each year to the top wide receiver in college football. \nContact Daniel Paulling at dpaulling@jackson.gannett.com.
