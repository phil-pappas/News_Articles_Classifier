They’ve been very close.”\nIn five games, Towles has completed 61.5 percent of his passes for 1,153 yards, eight touchdowns and six interceptions. He sixth in the SEC in passing yards per game and seventh in the league in completion percentage.\nWhile Towles has battled inconsistency for long stretches in the first five games, Stoops declined to place all the plan on the fourth-year junior.\n“Sure he wants to be more consistent, but our team needs to be more consistent,” Stoops said. “It wasn’t him that put the ball on the ground the first possession of the game either, so there’s things that happen. It’s not always him.\n“As I said after the Florida game, it’s always easy to put the bullseye on the quarterback. Put it on the head coach. That’s what they pay for me: to take the criticism. The players, I like to stay away from that. We’re all going to be held accountable, and those players are. In our meetings he understands that he needs to play better, but he’s done some awfully good things and led us to some victories in some close games.”\nEmail Jon Hale at jahale@courier-journal.com .
