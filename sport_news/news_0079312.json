Tom Thibodeau , one of the NBA ’s most respected coaches but currently out of work, has been touring selected training camps and after spending a couple of days with the Warriors over the weekend, he returned to the team’s practice Wednesday.\nWhat’s going on here?\n“Well, after our loss last night, they brought him in to coach the team,” said interim head coach Luke Walton , trying to suppress a smile. “They demoted me. I’ll be behind the bench now. I’m done.”\nWhat is it about those Arizona grads? Walton, Steve Kerr , Tom Tolbert — they’ve all got that loose-and-easy sense of humor, with a wicked touch of sarcasm. It’s a quality that wins many admirers in sports and especially the coaching fraternity, into which Walton is making significant steps.\nWith the season’s final exhibition game Thursday night against the Lakers in Anaheim, the Warriors held their practice in the men’s gym alongside Pauley Pavilion on the UCLA campus, complete with a palpable sense of prestige.\nJohn Wooden ’s original chalkboard, the one he used to instruct his players from 1948 through ’65, is prominently displayed. Steve Nash , the Warriors’ recently signed consultant, worked with individual players. For several minutes, Jerry West looked to be in deep, earnest conversation with Walton.\nEverything seemed a good deal more NBA-authentic, after many days of exhibition games and experimental rotations. The only notably absent figure was Kerr, who now seems unlikely to be ready for Tuesday night’s season opener against Alvin Gentry , Anthony Davis and the New Orleans Pelicans at Oracle Arena.\nEverything’s very hush-hush as to Kerr’s status, but the Warriors are keeping it simple that way. “He was with us last night (at Staples Center , where the Warriors played the Clippers), and I’m sure he’ll be with us again,” Walton said. “I just don’t know when. He’s not ready to coach yet, and that’s kind of going to be the answer until one day he is ready. I don’t think it’ll be a gradual thing. He’ll just know.”\nAs far as opening night, “It’s not like he’ll wait until game time and show up,” Walton said. “As a staff, especially this next week, we’re prepping as if this is the staff we’ll have for Game 1. And if that’s not the case, we’ll be ready for it.”\nThe Warriors’ overall readiness has come into question on this Southern California road swing, but serious doubt seems inappropriate. Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson haven’t been on the court together since the Oct. 15 game against Houston. Free-agent guards Ian Clark and Chris Babb are getting a long look. The rotations and substitution patterns bear no resemblance to what’s coming for real.\nWhat people might forget as they raise the issues of luck and fortunate scheduling during last season’s playoffs: By the All-Star break, the Warriors were clearly the best team in the league. They were crushing everyone. The general consensus was that they should win the title, and that’s exactly what they did.\nIf people found it hard to fathom, it’s because the Warriors were the first team to turn a modern-day theory — up-tempo style, small-ball lineups, heavy emphasis on three-point shooting — into a championship. Nash came close with the Mike D’Antoni -coached Phoenix teams, but because they fell short, the concept remained something of a novelty.\nThe Warriors are now the beacons of radical change, and it’s not as if they’ll have much company. “It’s like every year teams in training camp say, ‘Oh, we’re gonna play faster this year. We’re gonna push the tempo,’” Clippers guard J. J. Redick told businessinsider.\ncom. “But you’ve got to have the right personnel to do it.\n“The reason Golden State was able to go small was because they have Draymond Green ,” Redick said. “Because they have Harrison Barnes and (Andre) Iguodala on the wing, and those guys can guard ‘4s’ (power forwards) for stretches. You can’t just say ‘We’re gonna play small at times.’ Not everybody has Golden State’s roster.”\nThe trick for Curry, Green and everyone else will be to maintain a killer instinct and stay determined to run everyone — LeBron James , James Harden , Kevin Durant , everyone — out of the building. They almost have to pretend that last season never happened, that they still have many people to impress.\nOf course, last season did happen, and Clippers head coach Doc Rivers sees that as a huge advantage. “No matter who the Warriors come back with, they’re better because you’ve won, you’ve been through it,” he said before Tuesday night’s game. “You have that unshakable confidence. Championship swagger is not a fake. It’s for real. Everyone else hopes and thinks; they know they can win.”\nGreen looked a bit discouraged after a rough night at Staples Center, but said, “I don’t think it’s a deep concern. If you lose by 35, it ain’t just OK, though. There’s a lot of stuff we can tune up. We’ve got to start bringing it, and we will. We’ll be fine.”\nBruce Jenkins is a San Francisco Chronicle columnist.
