Kickoff is set for 7:30 p.m.\nHalftime: MSU coach Dan Mullen, speaking to ESPN at the half, said, “We finished great, except for the points there at the end, but that’s on me for not kicking it deep.”\nHe added on UK that, “Every year, it’s a close game with them. Every game with them has come down to the wire, so we’ve got to come out and play a great second half.”\nSee a full box score with the Cats trailing 28-13: bit.ly/1H26bXw .\nHALFTIME: MacGinnis' season-long 48-yard field goal ends the first half. Bulldogs up 28-13. #UKvsMSST pic.twitter.com/u0ZdB5OiN6\n— Kentucky Football (@UKFootball) October 25, 2015 0:00, 2Q: Mississippi State quarterback Dak Prescott went 289 passes without an interception to cap last season and start this one. When he finally tossed a pick, one nabbed by UK freshman Chris Westry, the Wildcats failed to make him pay.\nUK followed with a 49-yard field goal pulled just left, and the Bulldogs responded by scoring twice before the half.\nFirst came a five-play, 69-yard drive. Then Patrick Towles threw an interception of his own, one caught brilliantly over the shoulder by the MSU’s Taveze Calhoun. Brandon Holloway turned a short pass into a 63-yard gain, and Prescott then ran ahead 20 more for another score.\nBut with fewer than two minutes left, UK set itself up for another field goal try. Austin MacGinnis hit this time from 48 yards, making the score 28-13 into the half.\nIn all, the Bullogs out-gained the Wildcats 233-86 in the second quarter.\nWestry’s interception did make for one UK positive. Former quarterback Andre’ Woodson still holds the SEC record for most passes without an interception at 325.\n0:03, 2Q: UK needed that one. Austin MacGinnis made good on his earlier miss, belting through a 48-yard field goal just before the half to pull the Cats to within two scores at 28-13.\n0:34, 2Q: The effort has come unhinged for UK. Dak Prescott just scooted 20 yards for another score, moving the Bulldogs ahead 28-10 into the half. UK has been out-gained 233 yards to 59 in the second quarter.\n1:03, 2Q: Somehow, MSU's threatening again. Patrick Towles tossed his first interception of the game on a brilliant over-the-shoulder grab by Taveze Calhoun. On the next play, Brandon Holloway turned a short pass into a 63-yard gain. It's back to the red zone for the host Bulldogs.\nWe're about one more reviewed play away from a two-hour 1st half.\n— Les Johns (@Les_Johns) October 25, 2015 1:34, 2Q: Five plays after Austin MacGinnis missed a field goal, MSU doubled up on UK. Dak Prescott completed all four of his passes, and Brandon Holloway added an 18-yard rush on the Bulldogs' way to their third score of the night. Make it 21-10 just before the half.\n3:05, 2Q: Another UK drive stalled before the half following three straight Patrick Towles incompletions. Not all were on the quarterback, but the result was the same -- a long Austin MacGinnis field goal. This one, the kicker pulled to the left. The score remains 14-10.\n5:54, 2Q: Chris Westry ended Dak Prescott's interception streak. It had been quite a while since the Heisman Trophy candidate a year ago turned it over -- 289 attempts, third-most in SEC history.. On an underthrown pass, Westry came up big to get UK the ball back.\nAll due respect to Trevard Lindley, but Chris Westry's got a chance to be UK's best DB in my lifetime. What. A. Play. Prescott streak ends.\n— Justin Rowland (@RowlandRIVALS) October 25, 2015 6:03, 2Q: UK's offense can move the ball, but its threats are inconsistent. After completions of 14 yards to Dorian Baker and 12 to Garrett Johnson, the Cats stalled and punted for a second time tonight. Landon Foster's boot set up MSU, still up 14-10, at its own 14-yard line.\n9:18, 2Q: UK's defense came up with a pivotal stop, and it was Matt Elam who helped plug up a 4th-and-1 MSU rush in the red zone. A video review upheld the spot, and the Cats have the ball back.\nThis is the fourth time this season that the UK defense has stopped the opponent on fourth down.\n— Kentucky Football (@UKFootball) October 25, 2015 11:25, 2Q: MSU got its defense off the field quickly following a touchdown by the host Bulldogs. A sack set UK up with an impossible 3rd and 18 situation, and MSU, sporting a 14-10 lead, brought pressure on a punt in the shadow of the Cats' goalposts. The Bulldogs will set up at the Cats' 41, looking to grow their advantage.\n13:38, 2Q: Dak Prescott has now run for and passed for MSU touchdowns. Prescott looked off a defensive back, then found De'Runnya Wilson cutting over the middle for a 13-yard score. Easy. It's 14-10 in Starkville, and Prescott's 10 of 12 for 115 yards through the air.\nBoom Williams has surpassed his rushing total from last season (486) in the first quarter of his sixth game this year.\n— Jon Hale (@JonHale_CJ) October 25, 2015 Boom Williams is the 2nd fastest player at UK in the last 30 seasons to reach 1,000 career rushing yards (16 games)\n— Corey Price (@coreyp08) October 25, 2015 0:00, 1Q: Both UK quarterback Patrick Towles and Mississippi State’s Dak Prescott produced 1-yard touchdown runs in the first quarter. Largely, the Wildcats had running back Stanley “Boom” Williams to thank for pushing them ahead 10-7.\nWilliams surpassed 1,000 yards for his career while racking up 80 yards on his seven carries, his longest rush 25 yards.\nTowles also completed his first seven passes, but he then missed on his next three to stall UK’s final drive. Kicker Austin MacGinnis came on to drill a 44-yard field goal amid the clanging of cowbells.\nOfficials actually called back UK's biggest play, a would-be gain of more than 40 yards by Garrett Johnson on a screen pass out to the right. But he was ruled to have stepped out at midfield rather than in the red zone. The Cats hit their field goal six plays later.\n0:56, 1Q: Patrick Towles, who opened by completing his first seven passes, then missed three straight to stall the Cats' latest drive. A positive, though, is a healthy Austin MacGinnis. The kicker came on to hit a 44-yard field goal and push UK back ahead 10-7.\nTaunting isn't nice little girl. You definitely wouldn't want him to do that to you... #SECNation @KySportsRadio pic.twitter.com/mRcbBOiLUL\n— Ryan Ellis (@iRyanEllis) October 25, 2015 2:11, 1Q: Garrett Johnson wouldn't go down. The UK receiver, on a screen pass to the right flat, shook off a tackle, then tip-toed down the sideline for 43 yards. If only his toe wasn't ruled out by replay, setting up the Cats with 1st and 10 at midfield instead of 1st and goal. The home fans loved the call.\n2:49, 1Q: Star quarterback Dak Prescott's 15th rushing touchdown of the season has the score knotted at 7-7. As with UK's Patrick Towles, all it took was a yard burst forward into the end zone. Prescott is also 6 of 8 for 54 yards passing early.\nElam just asked for a breather, and Tymere Dubose checks in. I've got Elam at 12 of the 14 defensive snaps so far.\n— Jon Hale (@JonHale_CJ) October 25, 2015 4:16, 1Q: MSU tried to pick on Matt Elam by running at the 360-pounder on UK's defensive front until he tired and left the game. Once he did, facing 4th and short, the Bulldogs went to the air to convert. They're down to the 21-yard line and trailing 7-0.\n8:19, 1Q: Patrick Towles completed all three of his passes, and Boom Williams delivered runs of 14 and 9 yards before Towles sneaked in for a 1-yard score. A lengthy review determined the score, and UK now leads on the road. Towles is 5 for 5 and Williams has 45 yards already. It's 7-0.\nGood drive by the Wildcats to take the lead 7-0 in the first quarter. #UKvsMSST pic.twitter.com/MB7j6yikIx\n— Kentucky Football (@UKFootball) October 25, 2015 11:12, 1Q: A promising opening UK drive ended with a punt, one Landon Foster pinned at the MSU 11. Three plays later, already the Bulldogs are punting thanks to solid pass coverage by the Cats.\n13:58, 1Q: Boom Williams' big-play ability saved UK early. On 3rd and 10, UK went with a draw, and he found the left sideline for a gain of 25. The Cats are out to mid field.\nOnly thing that can make cowbells more annoying: Ringing them to the beat of \"Who let the dogs out?\"\n— Jon Hale (@JonHale_CJ) October 24, 2015 15:00, 1Q: A sight of relief for UK fans. Vanderbilt didn't let Missouri score on the SEC Network's lead-in to Cats-Bulldogs. MSU won the toss and deferred to the second half in Starkville, by the way.\nThe Kentucky contingent in Davis Wade Stadium tonight. It's a little bit loud in here. pic.twitter.com/gdw5Lojgrm\n— Alex Forkner (@AlexForknerTCP) October 24, 2015 PREGAME: The stakes aren't the same for MSU as the last time these two teams met -- Dak Prescott led the No. 1 Bulldogs into Commonwealth Stadium last year -- but this one may have major postseason implications for UK.\nThe Wildcats, who still have Vanderbilt and UNC-Charlotte left to play this season, could take a step toward their first season of bowl eligibility under coach Mark Stoops with a victory.\nUK enters at 4-2 and off 30-27 loss to Auburn, while MSU went out of conference for its last two, beating Troy and Louisiana Tech.\nNotably, this is only the Wildcats' second road game of the season after knocking off South Carolina in September. The program hasn't won its first two of the season away from Commonwealth Stadium since 1999.\nIf you missed any of our pre-Mississippi State coverage this week, here it is all in one spot https://t.co/RIWfGXoRe8\n— Jon Hale (@JonHale_CJ) October 24, 2015 Here is tonight's uniform combination. #Allin #UKvsMsstate\nA photo posted by ukfootball (@ukfootball) on Oct 24, 2015 at 1:50pm PDT", "external_links": ["https://t.co/gdw5Lojgrm", "https://twitter.com/AlexForknerTCP/status/658063668391890944", "https://twitter.com/UKFootball/status/658072311493447680", "https://twitter.com/UKFootball/status/658084068064669696", "http://cjky.it/1kDGEiX", "https://twitter.com/JonHale_CJ/status/658078199675514881", "https://t.co/mRcbBOiLUL", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/UKvsMSST?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/JonHale_CJ/status/657924325513785346", "https://twitter.com/KySportsRadio", "https://twitter.com/Les_Johns/status/658092875775922176", "https://twitter.com/coreyp08/status/658075511772553216", "https://twitter.com/JonHale_CJ/status/658073381749788672", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/SECNation?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/iRyanEllis/status/658074799227449344", "https://instagram.com/p/9PAAWloNtI/", "https://t.co/MB7j6yikIx", "https://t.co/RIWfGXoRe8", "https://twitter.com/RowlandRIVALS/status/658086370808729600", "https://twitter.com/UKFootball/status/658095206324183041", "http://bit.ly/1H26bXw", "https://t.co/u0ZdB5OiN6", "https://twitter.com/JonHale_CJ/status/658065037739868161"], "published": "2015-10-25T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:45:01.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
