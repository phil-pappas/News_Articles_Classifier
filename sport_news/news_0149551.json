(AP Photo/Richard Shiro) × Quarterback Deshaun Watson is 6-0 at Clemson when he starts games and doesn’t get hurt, but fellow sophomore Wayne Gallman is the key Saturday night when the No. 12 Tigers play host to No. 6 Notre Dame in the biggest game yet for both players. \nOnline \nTo play along, go to postandcourier.com/pigskinpicks . Gallman, a 6-1, 215-pound running back from Loganville, Ga., must keep the heat off Watson, and keep the ball away from the Irish. Gallman doesn’t have to duplicate his 191-yard performance in a 35-17 victory over South Carolina last November, or the 139 yards on 24 carries notched in a 20-17 win at Louisville on Sept. 17. But on a dry field, in heavy rain or muddy slime, Gallman probably has to run for 100 yards and win some third downs. Better yet, offensive coordinators Tony Elliott and Jeff Scott should make more use of Gallman as a pass receiver. Because you know Notre Dame head coach and defensive coordinator Brian Van Gorder will get maximum effort from hungry players in what looks like a playoff elimination game. “We have to get out on the practice field and execute,” linebacker Joe Schmidt said earlier this week, “and then ultimately be ready emotionally, spiritually, physically on Saturday to execute. So that’s where we’re at.” Yeah, same approach here after my 5-5 Pigskin Picks performance last week, which dropped me into a tie with surging Warren Peper. On Week 5: Notre Dame at Clemson A good start is critical; Notre Dame has outscored its foes 47-6 in the first quarter. Clemson’s first quarters keep getting worse: 14-0 Wofford, 3-0 Appalachian State, 0-0 Louisville. Sapakoff pick: Notre Dame, 24-21 Peper pick: Clemson, 24-21 South Carolina at Missouri Games with 300 or more yards of total offense this season: Lorenzo Nunez 1, Deshaun Watson 0. The South Carolina freshman quarterback showed exceptional poise in a 31-14 victory over Central Florida last week. All he has to do this week is keep the Gamecocks’ bowl hopes afloat as a road underdog. Sapakoff pick: S. Carolina, 17-16 Peper pick: Missouri, 24-19 S.C. State at Furman If Furman (2-2) is good enough to beat Central Florida, why not S.C. State (2-1)? But the Bulldogs’ Jalen Simmons rushed for 168 yards in a 36-0 victory over Florida A&M. Sapakoff pick: Furman, 21-18 Peper pick: S.C. State, 28-20 Alabama at Georgia Nick Chubb vs. one of Alabama’s better front sevens as the Bulldogs try to establish themselves as a playoff favorite. Sapakoff pick: Alabama, 24-21 Peper pick: Georgia, 31-24 Ole Miss at Florida The Gators are one of the nation’s most surprising undefeated teams but the margin is thin and Ole Miss has allowed just two rushing touchdowns this season. Sapakoff pick: Ole Miss, 31-21 Peper pick: Florida, 30-28 Arkansas at Tennessee These are the two teams Steve Spurrier in July said were doing “cartwheels” over 7-6 records in 2014, and both fan bases bristled. The loser of this game might embrace 7-6 in 2015. Sapakoff pick: Tennessee, 24-17 Peper pick: Tennessee, 29-27 Louisville at N.C. State Quietly, N.C. State (ACC-best 46.2 points per game) is about to go 5-0 for the first time since 2002. And might be 7-0 when Clemson arrives on Oct. 31. Sapakoff pick: N.C. State, 27-21 Peper pick: N.C. State, 24-19 Pittsburgh at Virginia Tech The first ACC game for teams coming off non-conference losses (27-24 at Iowa for Pitt, 35-28 at East Carolina for Virginia Tech). The Hokies have lost shutdown corner Kendall Fuller (knee surgery) for the season. Sapakoff pick: Virginia Tech, 28-27 Peper pick: Virginia Tech, 30-20 North Carolina at Georgia Tech The Yellow Jackets’ triple-option looked broken without a scary receiver in back-to-back losses to Notre Dame and Duke. Sapakoff pick: Georgia Tech, 31-28 Peper pick: Georgia Tech, 34-21 Air Force at Navy Navy is 3-0 overall, and 2-0 in its new home, the American Athletic Conference. Air Force (2-1) just outgained Michigan State (428-328) in a 35-21 loss.
