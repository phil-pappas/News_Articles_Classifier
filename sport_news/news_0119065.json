The other is the Tampa Bay Rays, who play at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Fla. The Mets played there this season, too, losing two of three to the Rays. So at least the Mets have had some recent experience on artificial turf, if that does end up being a factor in the Series.\nKeeping Score A regular analytical, statistics-based sports column.
