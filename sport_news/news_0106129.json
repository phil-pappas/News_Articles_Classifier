The Wall Street Journal reports the USDA is hiring hundreds of veterinarians and temporary workers to respond to threats as the autumn migration season gets underway, while poultry processors like Tyson Foods and Cargill are strengthening biosecurity measures to keep the virus at bay. \"We have every reason to believe we could see an outbreak of some sort this fall as wild birds come back through the middle of the U.S.,\" Bill Northey, Iowa's agriculture secretary, told the Journal, which notes that Iowa was the nation's top egg producer before nearly 30 million hens were wiped out in the spring's outbreak. A new vaccine from Ames-based Harrisvaccines Inc. could help in the defense, but producers aren't taking any risks. \"I probably spend over $100,000 per month on truck washing\" now, Marcus Rust of Indiana-based Rose Acre Farms, told the Journal.
