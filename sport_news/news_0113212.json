That edged the state past Kentucky, which also has a competitive governor's race.\nOnly a few states have statewide elections this year.\nMore than $10 million has been poured into TV spots for the Louisiana governor's race alone, 43 percent of it spent by independent organizations. Republican US Sen. David Vitter and a super PAC supporting him account for $4.3 million.\nThe Center for Public Integrity analyzed data from Kantar Media/CMAG, a media tracking firm. These figures cover ads aired through Monday.\n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
