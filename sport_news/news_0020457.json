His 23-year-old daughter, Erin, died of the disease in 2002 after going in for outpatient surgery her father called \"simple.\" \n\"Three days later, she was gone,\" Flatley said. \"It never should have happened. Not even close. \n\"I was with Erin when she died. She was scared. You could see the look in her eyes, 'Can't you do something, dad?'\" \nFlatley has spent the last decade doing something. He founded Sepsis Alliance, an organization committed to battling sepsis through awareness in both the general public and the healthcare industry. \nHe now has the opportunity to do even more. \nFlatley's Sepsis Alliance is one of four finalists for the NASCAR Foundation’s Betty Jane France Humanitarian Award. The award will be decided through online voting, with the winner receiving $100,000 toward the charity. \n\"That award would validate that I did something,\" Flatley said. \nFlatley is a 1962 graduate of Richmond High School, and the younger brother of Paul Flatley, 1963 NFL Rookie of the Year for the Minnesota Vikings. \nCarl Flatley was nominated for the NASCAR Foundation award last year but did not make the finalists. \n\"My brother is trying to raise some money to make more people more aware of sepsis so more people can live,\" Paul Flatley said. \nMore than 258,000 Americans die of sepsis each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. \nThe number of sepsis cases rose from 621,000 in 2000 to 1,141,000 in 2008, according to the CDC. \nEarly treatment for the disease is important. \n\"Half of Americans have never heard of sepsis. It's incredible,\" Carl Flatley said. \nVoting for the award is available at www.nascar.com/award and can be done daily. Voting ends Dec. 3 and the award will be announced during the 2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Champion’s Week in Las Vegas. \nFlatley has started the online site www.carlspitcrew.com , which offers information on the award, Sepsis Alliance and daily reminders to vote. \n\"We've already won just being in that final four,\" Flatley said, noting each finalist will receive $25,000 toward the charity. \nFlatley has help from his hometown. \nChuck Wellings, 1959 Richmond graduate and owner of Wellings Steakhouse and Chuck's Sports Bar, has posters up and is handing out cards to remind people to vote. \n\"We're asking everybody to vote. Vote every day,\" Wellings said. \n\"It's just a small part. I'd do anything for him. He's just a super guy.\" \nWellings has seen how hard Flatley has worked to inform the public on sepsis. \n\"That's what he does. That's all he does,\" Wellings said. \"When his daughter died, that really hurt him. He vowed to take care of that situation.\" \nSepsis Alliance has started Sepsis Awareness Month each September and formed the Global Sepsis Alliance that Flatley said includes 70 countries. \nFlatley noted vaccinations and good hygiene are important in preventing sepsis. \n\"The public needs to know,\" he said. \"Only 19 percent of Americans back in 2002 had ever heard of the word. It's a major problem. \n\"Today, in one day, we lose 720 people in the United States. It's like two 747s crashing every day, and they've been crashing for decades. Until I started, there was no advocacy group out there. There is so much to do.\" \nFlatley is a retired dentist and now lives in Dunedin, Florida. His work with Sepsis Alliance keeps him extremely active. \n\"This is what I do now,\" he said. \"I thought I was going to retire. Now I'm busier than I was when I was working.\" \nJosh Chapin: (765) 973-4463 jchapin@pal-item.com or twitter.com/JoshChapinPI \nAt a Glance \nWhat: NASCAR Foundation Betty Jane France Humanitarian Award \nWho: Four finalists are up for the award, including 1962 Richmond High School graduate Carl Flatley and his Sepsis Alliance.
