Special teams assistant Devin Fitzsimmons will move to tight ends coach.\nThe Lions (1-6) allowed seven sacks and 13 quarterback hits Sunday in a 28-19 loss to the Minnesota Vikings. The offense scored touchdowns on its first two possessions before scoring just three points the rest of the game.\nJim Bob Cooter is pictured with Matthew Stafford in training camp.   (Photo: Daniel Mears, Detroit News) \nThe Lions rank 20th in yards and 29th in points per game despite having talented playmakers like Calvin Johnson, Golden Tate, Eric Ebron, Ameer Abdullah and Theo Riddick. Quarterback Matthew Stafford has also regressed overall as a player the past two years despite the Lions hiring Lombardi to help improve his game after working with Saints star Drew Brees the previous seven years.\nlthough the Lions went 11-5 in 2014 in the first year under Caldwell and Lombardi, the offense was problematic during the season that resulted in a first-round playoff exit. The Lions ranked 19th in total offense and 22nd in points per game despite having a similarly talented team with a more veteran offensive line.\nThe Lions are due to fly to London Monday night for next Sunday’s game against the Kansas City Chiefs. Although Monday’s firings signal a monumental change, there’s no telling if falling to 1-7 could force the front office or ownership to continue altering the coaching staff.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T19:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:26:19.141+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
