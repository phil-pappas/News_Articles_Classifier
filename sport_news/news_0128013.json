(AP) - Most of Louisiana's congressional delegation asked the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to let state residents continue to use their driver's licenses to enter federal courthouses and offices.\nLouisiana driver's licenses won't have all security measures of the decade-old REAL ID law in time for an Oct. 10 deadline. That's when identification considered compliant with REAL ID is required for entry into federal facilities.\nThe congressional delegation members asked for an extension. In a Monday letter, they say Louisiana is moving closer to compliance.\nBut it's unclear when Louisiana will meet the federal standards. Last year, Gov. Bobby Jindal vetoed a bill allowing full compliance with REAL ID.\nMonday's letter was signed by Sens. David Vitter and Bill Cassidy and Reps. Ralph Abraham, Charles Boustany, Garret Graves and Cedric Richmond.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
