Minooka fell to Plainfield East, 21-16. By DICK GOSS - dgoss@shawmedia.com \nMINOOKA â€“ When John Carnagio hit Jake Adams in the back of the end zone with a 4-yard touchdown pass in the closing second of the first half Friday night, it appeared the Indians were well on their way to their fifth victory in six games.

Plainfield East scored 21 points and held on to knock off the Indians, 21-16, in their Southwest Prairie battle. \nCarnagio's pass to Adams capped a 54-yard drive that began when Blake Parzych sacked East quarterback Matt Mazurkiewicz on a fourth-down play with 48 seconds left in the half. Earlier, Brennan Loughran had kicked a 40-yard field for Minooka (4-2, 2-2), which missed other scoring opportunities in the opening half. \nA 68-yard run by Elijah Williams gave the Indians a first down at the 22 of the Bengals (2-4, 2-2) to open the second half. Minooka then had a third-and-1, but East stuffed two running plays. \nA Jon Butler interception gave Minooka the ball back in Bengals' territory, but the Indians again could not move against an East defense led by lineman Donald Manning and linebacker Troy Mayon. The Bengals then marched the ball down the field to score on a Mazurkiewicz 6-yard pass to Jeremy Reitz. \nOn fourth down on Minooka's next possession, a high snap on a punt rolled to the 1-yard line. Mayon took it in on the next play to make it 14-10 East. \nThen after Minooka's Carson Oughton recovered a fumble at the 5-yard line to thwart an East threat, the Bengals' David Salazar intercepted a pass that went through the receiver's hands and took it in for a 5-yard touchdown and a 21-10 lead. \nMinooka scored in the fourth quarter on Carnagio's 25-yard pass to Isaiah Hll to get within 21-16, then had one more shot. But after Minooka earned a first-and-goal at the Bengals' 8-yard line, the East defense shut down one more time to end it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T16:48:39.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
