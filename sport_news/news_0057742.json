High-major college coaches scour the high school, prep and JUCO ranks for late-blooming players – particularly big men. Had Ryan Gomes decided to bypass the upcoming fall signing period, he might very well have been one of those cross-your-fingers spring signees. \nInstead, Gomes will put pen to paper next month on a letter of intent to Mount St. Mary’s, where he committed in July. Three months removed from his decision, the Friends School senior said he’s still convinced that he made the right move. \n“I honestly feel like it’s a weight off my shoulders,” said Gomes, who averaged 12.1 points, 8.1 rebounds and 3.0 blocks as a junior. “I feel confident with my decision. All I really feel the need to do is get better [and] focus on schoolwork. I’m honestly glad I made my decision early, rather than waiting around.” \nA 6-foot-10, 235-pound center, Gomes’ journey from a gangly freshman at Westminster to an assured, productive upper-classman at Friends featured plenty of highs and lows. \nOn the AAU circuit, Gomes spent time with Nike Baltimore Elite and then DC Premier (formerly DC Assault) before finally landing with the District Basketball Club. There were plusses associated with playing for those first two nationally renowned AAU programs – even though Gomes, at a young age, did so in a minor role – but his development left something to be desired.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:43:07.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
