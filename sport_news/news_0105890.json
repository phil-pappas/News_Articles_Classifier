The system is about to be tested more than it has since 2007-08, when Claude Julien took over as head coach and started the playoff run that finally ended last season. The 2014-15 Bruins allowed more than 200 goals for the first time since Julien's first season, but barely (201; eighth in the NHL), and they'd probably take that again this season. Lack of offense (209 goals; down from 258 the previous season), more than anything, caused the Bruins to fall two points short of a berth. It won't be easy for Boston to maintain its defensive standards, though. For the third year in a row, the Bruins have lost a major contributor on the blue line, and haven't replaced him with what would be considered a reasonable facsimile. Granted, Dougie Hamilton (traded to Calgary) wasn't a defensive stalwart in the mold of Andrew Ference (free agent) or Johnny Boychuk (trade), who departed before him, but he formed half of last season's top defensive pairing, with captain Zdeno Chara. It's a major role to fill, and Chara hasn't been available to try out new partners. Sidelined by an upper-body injury since his only preseason appearance, on Sept. 24, Chara has started practicing and could be ready for Thursday's opener against the Winnipeg Jets. Still, he may not have a good working relationship with a partner right away. The No. 2 pairing, meanwhile, is a mystery that will linger well into November. Dennis Seidenberg, who came off major knee surgery to play all 82 games last season, is recovering from back surgery. At 38 and 34, respectively, Chara and Seidenberg remain the Bruins' top two defensemen, but they're both at points in their career where they could use some support. There is a bit of returning experience behind them in Adam McQuaid (283 career games), Torey Krug (160) and Kevan Miller (88), while ex-Shark Matt Irwin has played 153 games over three NHL seasons, but whether it's Zach Trotman (29 games), Joe Morrow (15) or newcomer Colin Miller (none), at least one rookie, and perhaps more, will always be in the lineup. Fortunately, defense isn't just the responsibility of defensemen, and the Bruins' forwards are a competent, conscientious group. Three-time Selke Trophy winner Patrice Bergeron, a true defensive star, centers what's expected to be one of the NHL's best shutdown lines with Brad Marchand and Loui Eriksson; top offensive center David Krejci plays a two-way game not far behind Bergeron's, and the new version of the fourth line will probably include veteran Chris Kelly, another defensive standout. So what's the issue, besides those injuries on the blue line? The Bruins are under orders to accelerate their pace of play and press for more scoring opportunities – and that includes defensemen, who are being pushed to join any offensive rush they can. When those four-man rushes don't work out, the Bruins are going to give up scoring chances at their own end of the ice. \"Yeah, 100 percent,\" said goalie Tuukka Rask. \"That's a natural thing, right? If you're taking offensive chances, you're going to be exposed at times. \"That's why I'm here. If it's going to be a 2-on-1 or 3-on-2 against us, so be it. I should be able to stop those.\" One year removed from winning the 2013-14 Vezina Trophy (2.04 goals-against average, .930 saves percentage), Rask can afford a \"bring it on\" attitude, although his play dipped (2.30, .922) as a result of last season's withering, 70-game workload, which tied a franchise record. The Bruins have given him a more experienced backup this season in veteran Jonas Gustavsson (148 NHL games), a tryout candidate who beat out veteran AHLer Jeremy Smith for the job. Their quest for more offense aside, the Bruins aren't supposed to leave their goalies high and dry. \"We haven't abandoned the structure part of our game without the puck,\" said first-year general manager Don Sweeney. \"We're going to defend the way you're supposed to defend to give yourself a chance to win in the NHL.\" Without a defined No. 1 pairing and their No. 2 defenseman, though, it's not hard to see the Bruins' defense being a work in progress to start the season.
