We are in a difficult moment, it would be stupid to deny it.” \n“I am the first to admit this and I assume, as president of the federation, absolute responsibility.” \nCoach Pierre Saint-Andre, the former national captain, ended a difficult four years in charge with the defeat at Cardiff on Saturday. \nIt was France’s worst World Cup since 1991 and they have not been in the top three places in the Six Nations in any year of Saint-Andre’s reign. \nCamou said the federation executive board would have an emergency meeting in Paris on Thursday when he expects “everyone to speak freely”. \nThe FFR leader said France would have to consider introducing central contracts as New Zealand, Australia, England and other leading nations have. \nThe contracts make sure players are free for internationals and are not over burdened with club games. \nCamou also criticised France’s powerful Top 14 championship for not giving more help to young players. \n“For six years we have been trying to reform everything, the age groups, the teams,” he said. \n“But the kids don’t play (in Top 14). They never play. But the best training is playing.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:29:33.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
