Bayern Munich’s Manuel Neuer reacts after Mesut Ozil scored the second goal for Arsenal during their UEFA Champions League Group Stage - Group F match at Emirates Stadium, London, October 20, 2015. — Reuters pic \nAgainst Bayern on Tuesday, which Arsenal won with late goals from Giroud and Mesut Ozil, the breakthrough came after Giroud replaced Walcott in the 74th minute. \nGiroud pounced to score from a Santi Cazorla free-kick three minutes after coming on before Ozil scored the second with the last kick of the game. \n“On Tuesday night we based our game on counter-attack and it nearly worked and in the last part of the game we based it on longer ball,” Wenger said. \nArsenal are on a good run having won five of their last six games in all competitions, and will move up from second if they win because current leaders Manchester City and third-placed Manchester United do not meet until Sunday. \nCity have 21 points, Arsenal and United both have 19 and the Gunners start as clear favourites against an Everton side who were well beaten 3-0 by United last week. Arsenal beat United 3-0 on October4. \n“If you want to play at the top of the Premier League you have to do well at home in big games,” Wenger said. \n“Our target on Saturday is to take advantage of it, because we play before everybody else.” — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:57:16.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
