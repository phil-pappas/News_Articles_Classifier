Dias gave Mashpee (3-2, 2-1 South Shore League) a 23-14 lead midway through the second quarter with three scores, adding his fourth touchdown in the third quarter. Dias tied Jared Taylor for the Falcons’ record in varsity touchdowns with 28 with his second score, a 54-yard run in the second quarter. His final two gave him a total of 30 for his career. Dias’ second touchdown gave Mashpee a 14-8 lead after the senior running back got the Falcons going with a 6-yard run in the first quarter. Dias added a 46-yard run and junior quarterback Nick Carpenter busted through the Pirates defensive line for a 1-yard touchdown late in the first half to give Mashpee a 28-14 lead at the half. Dias finished his day with a 70-yard sprint in the third quarter, with junior Jason Andrade capping scoring for the Falcons with a 29-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. Fern Berry struck for three touchdowns for Hull (1-4, 1-2 SSL), with scoring runs of 2-yards, 60-yards and 50-yards. Carpenter, who added a pair of two-point conversion passes to his day offensively, was also key on defense for Mashpee, forcing two turnovers, one on an interception and another on a forced fumble, recovered by junior Jack Rodriguez. Senior Joey Spinola added seven tackles defensively for the Falcons, with two going for a loss. Cohasset 24, St. John Paul II 0: Senior Jack Donohue caught touchdowns passes and returned a recovered fumble for a third score to lead the Skippers to victory in Cohasset. Taking a slim 3-0 lead to the half on the strength of a 27-yard field goal by senior Henry Butenschoen, Donohue hauled in a 49-yard pass from junior quarterback Xander Schubert, later adding a 5-yard touchdown catch, before returning a recovered fumble 65 yards for Cohasset’s final touchdown. The Skippers improve to 4-1. Seniors Andrew Faria and Allen Fox led a strong St. John Paul II contingent on defense with seven tackles each while sophomore Josh Valenzano added six tackles for the Lions (3-2). Bishop Stang 13, Martha’s Vineyard 0: Nick Landry gave the Spartans all the offense they would need, with Jeff Chicca adding an insurance touchdown in the fourth quarter of a win over the Vineyarders in North Dartmouth. Landry, a junior, ran in a score of 21 yards in the opening quarter, with the point-after-touchdown giving Bishop Stang (4-1, 1-1 Eastern Athletic Conference) a 7-0 lead.
