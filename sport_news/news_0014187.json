Ira Winderman Contact Reporter South Florida Sun Sentinel Justise Winslow appreciates his NBA reality different from most lottery picks \nFrom the moment he fell to the Miami Heat at No. 10 in the NBA draft, it became apparent that Justise Winslow's journey was going to be different than most NBA lottery picks. \nThe opportunities behind the proven veterans would be limited. Not only would he not be asked to dominate offensively, but his touches would be rationed. And regularly playing as a starter was a concept that ended at the conclusion of summer league. \nThat made Tuesday's overtime exhibition loss in Orlando different. With the starters given the night off, he again could probe, bypass shots, work into a rhythm. In the extra period there even was an opportunity for a clear-out possession, when his driving layup tied it with 33.4 seconds to play. \nBy the weekend, when the Heat resume their preseason with a Saturday road exhibition against the Houston Rockets, Dwyane Wade, Luol Deng and Goran Dragic will be back. And so will a more complementary role for Winslow. So, for now, the game in Orlando remains a mere sampling of what one day -- but likely not any time soon -- could be his pro reality. \n\"I mean it's definitely an adjustment, especially coming off the bench, that's something that's new,\" Winslow said of his preseason nights other than Tuesday. \"But it's a lot of adjustment. So that's something I just got to get used to.\" Erik Spoelstra downplays McRoberts, Stoudemire knee issues \nErik Spoelstra says knees not a concern with McRoberts, Stoudemire missing past two exhibitions. \nErik Spoelstra says knees not a concern with McRoberts, Stoudemire missing past two exhibitions.

And he still leads all Heat players in minutes, with half of the eight-game preseason schedule now concluded. \n\"You saw in the overtime, all the plays going down the stretch, the ball in Justise's hands,\" coach Erik Spoelstra said. \"So when he's playing with veterans, he's not normally getting those type of opportunities.\" \nSo, no, Winslow might not be prime real estate when it comes to NBA fantasy leagues. And Spoelstra said even the type of numbers NBA insiders covet could lie when it comes to the swingman out of Duke.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:46:35.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
