They just responded really well. They came together as a team to dig deep and keep playing.\"Davenport made it 7-0 before suffering his injury. Hency made it 13-0 before Blake Kern returned an interception for a touchdown to make it 19-0.The Tigers (4-3, 3-1) scored with seven seconds left before halftime.Davenport's injury also put Isaac Felkins into a starting role at linebacker. Jones said he did excellent.\"He just stepped in a played a great game,\" he said.Lamar will travel to Danville on Friday. Jones was certain they would be without Davenport, who will receive an MRI on Monday to determined the extent of the injury to his knee.Danville is typically a game that has been close for Lamar — even when the Little Johns are down and the Warriors are up.\"Danville keeps scoring 60 points on people,\" Jones said. \"That's scary. The thing is, we are always going into that game after Charleston. That's such an emotional game for us, there is some hangover. Danville is a really, really good football team this year.
