That left them with a fourth-and-2 at the Michigan State 47 with 10 seconds left. Punter Blake O'Neill fumbled and Jalen Watts-Jackson returned the football 38 yards to give the Spartans a stunning 27-23 win.\nHarbaugh says one play never decides a football game.\nThe 15th-ranked Wolverines don't play again until Oct. 31 at Minnesota.\n Football College Men Associated Press", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-20T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:36:28.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
