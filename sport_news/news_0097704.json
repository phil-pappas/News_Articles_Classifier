(AP) - Evander Kane tied it with 4:29 left with his first goal for Buffalo and the Sabres beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 2-1 in a shootout Wednesday night. \nMatt Moulson and Tyler Ennis scored in the shootout, while Chad Johnson made 23 saves as Buffalo improved to 2-4. \nP.A. Parenteau scored and Jonathan Bernier made 34 saves as the Maple Leafs fell to 1-3-2. \nBuffalo got off to a fast start, but it was Parenteau who opened the scoring when he redirected Roman Polak's shot from the right point over Johnson's shoulder at the 1:28 mark. \nKane pushed a wrister past Bernier on Buffalo's 33rd shot of the night. Buffalo traded for Kane last February, but he didn't debut with the Sabres until this season after undergoing shoulder surgery. \nThe game went to 3-on-3 overtime, where Buffalo quickly had a 3-on-1 foiled by Bernier. \n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
