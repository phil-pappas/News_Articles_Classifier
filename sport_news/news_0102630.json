Meanwhile, Dawson County slammed Banks County 45-0 to help clear the way for a shot at the program's first-ever region title. \nAs exciting as those results were, little could compare to the finishes at Fannin County and Winder-Barrow, however. West Hall traveled to Blue Ridge and pulled out a thrilling, 40-37 double overtime defeat of Fannin -- a result that also helped give the Tigers a title shot next week when they host Lumpkin County in Dawsonville. Also in 7-AAA play, East Hall knocked off Franklin County 34-27 in Carnesville to help keep the Vikings neck-and-neck with Dawson -- though the Tigers do have the edge due to their head-to-head win over East Hall earlier in the season. \nIn Region 8- , Winder pulled off yet another thrilling win, knocking off Clarke Central 21-17. The win represented the Bulldoggs' fourth of the season decided by one possession and kept Winder in the thick of the playoff hunt. Also in 8- , Gainesville pulled away from Cedar Shoals 46-18 to right the ship after two straight defeats and set-up a big showdown at Loganville next week. Lanier kept a stranglehold on first in the region with a 31-10 defeat of Salem. \nElsewhere, Habersham Central notched its first win of the campaign, 21-6 over Johns Creek in Region 6- . \nIn Region 8-AAAA, North Hall maintained its push for the playoffs, blanking Monroe Area 25-0. Buford and Stephens County also maintained their undefeated marks in region play, the Wolves dominating North Oconee 56-7 and Stephens dumping Madison County 39-13. White County also kept its playoff hopes alive courtesy a 52-11 win at Chestatee. \nMill Creek also kept its perfect record and drilled Collins Hill 42-17 to get off to a great start in its key three-game slate to end the 7- campaign. \nBe sure to check out our Friday Game Night page for game stories and video highlights from Week 9 action. \nWEEK 9 AREA HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL SCORES, Oct. 23 Athens Christian 43, Lakeview Academy 21 \nBuford 56, North Oconee 7 \nCentennial 49, North Forsyth 39 \nCommerce 49, Towns County 0 \nDawson County 45, Banks County 0 \nEast Hall 34, Franklin County 27 \nGainesville 46, Cedar Shoals 18 \nGreene County 39, Riverside Military 0 \nHabersham Central 21, Johns Creek 6 \nHeritage, Conyers 34, Apalachee 14 \nJackson County 69, East Jackson 7 \nLanier 31, Salem 10 \nMill Creek 42, Collins Hill 17 \nNorth Gwinnett 53, Duluth 7 \nNorth Hall 25, Monroe Area 0 \nRabun County 43, Washington-Wilkes 10 \nStephens County 39, Madison County 13 \nWest Hall 40, Fannin County 37 2OT \nWhite County 52, Chestatee 11 \nWinder-Barrow 21, Clarke Central 10", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:14:46.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
