Coming off a Sweet 16 appearance last March, the Mountaineers lose their top two point guards, Juwan Staten and Gary Brown, but return the rest of their playmakers and add in some talented newcomers. \nHuggins said guys like Jonathan Holton and Nathan Adrian are shooting it better than ever before, and he’s a firm believer that Jevon Carter and Tarik Phillip can fill what appears to be the largest hole at point guard. The press, which helped WVU lead the country in steals last year, can be even better with a year of experience, he said, and highly-touted freshman Esa Ahmad should provide another weapon. \nOn paper, this team could be special. \nThen the veteran coach, with 765 career wins and 21 NCAA Tournament appearances, looks at the schedule. There’s a game in New York against Virginia, ranked No. 5 in Athlon Sports’ preseason poll. There’s a possible matchup with California, ranked No. 13 on that list, and other quality opponents like Richmond, Virginia Tech and Florida. \n“I’m never going to get to 1,000 wins if I keep playing the people I’m playing,” joked Huggins Thursday in his preseason session with the media. “I want to play in New York, but Virginia is a Top 5 team. Everybody says those are good for you. They’re good for you if you win. When you don’t win, they’re not very good for you. We need to go figure out a way to win. \n“We’re playing a very competitive schedule, but we always have. We’ve won more games in the eight years that we’ve been here than they did from Fred Schaus all the way through John Beilein against Top 25 teams. Think about that. Obviously, we play a lot more of them, and that gives you more chances to beat them. But you also have more chances to lose.” \nA lot of those opportunities will come in conference play. Kansas is No. 6 in that Athlon poll, while Iowa State is No. 7. Oklahoma is No. 9, and Baylor was just on the outside of the Top 25. The Mountaineers will play each of those teams at least twice, and possibly some of them three times depending on matchups in the Big 12 tournament. \n“That’s three teams in the Top 10, and we only have 10 teams,” said Huggins, who said the Big 12 provides the most challenging test of any league in which he’s competed. “The Big East was great — 10 teams. (The other) six weren’t very good. We don’t have that bottom (in the Big 12). Nine out of 10 teams last year were ranked at one point in time. That’s never happened.” \nHuggins said the statistics tell the story of just how good the Big 12 is and has been. \n“With 10 teams, we have the second-most first-round picks,” he explained. “With 10 teams, we have the second-most lottery picks. I think we have the second-most draft picks. And everybody else has 16 teams. We have 10. It’s amazing the talent in that league.” \nAnd then there’s the coaches. Bill Self (Kansas), Tubby Smith (Texas Tech), Lon Kruger (Oklahoma), Shaka Smart (Texas), Bruce Weber (Kansas State) and Huggins have all taken teams to the Final Four, and the other four have proven track records, as well. \n“There’s never been a league in the history of basketball where 60 percent of your coaches coached in the Final Four,” said Huggins. “Three of the other four coached in the Elite Eight. It’s a very talented league player-wise, and it’s a great coaches league. Everybody in our league is going to have good coaches, because people want to coach in our league — until they get in it, then they start thinking, ‘What did I do?’ \n“We’re going to get the best of the best. I sit around in those meetings and look around. We had it in the Big East, to a degree, but we also had guys you never heard of. And some of them you haven’t heard from since. Let’s be honest.” \nLife in the Big 12, though, isn’t perfect for the Mountaineers. While coaches and administrators refuse to use increased travel as an excuse and downplay its significance, Huggins admitted Thursday it can be a challenge. \n“When you get back at 4 or 5 in the morning, it’s hard,” he said. “I don’t care who you are. To get up and go to practice the next day, it’s hard. I think the players get used to it, and the league has tried to help. The University’s done everything it can possibly do from a transportation standpoint and that kind of thing, but it’s still what it is. They’re flying an hour. We’re not. They don’t have a time change. We do.” \nThe easy solution would be to add teams to the league, already smaller than most, and get some other teams in the Eastern time zone a little closer to the Mountaineers. That could also get the league to 12 teams in football and provide an avenue to a championship game. \nIt all sounds good, in theory, but Huggins said he hopes the league won’t rush into anything. \n“I just hope we don’t do what they did with Conference USA,” he said. “They kept diluting it for football. At one time it was one of the best basketball leagues in the country, and then they keep diluting it to add football teams that had really bad basketball teams.” \nHuggins, though, doesn’t see that happening in the Big 12.
