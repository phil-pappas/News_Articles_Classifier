The Royals forced the decider at Kauffman Stadium by rallying from a four-run deficit in the eighth inning Monday in Houston.\nThe Astros will counter with Collin McHugh, who threw a gem in winning the series opener.\n\"Obviously this is the deciding game,\" Cueto said through a translator after the Royals worked out Tuesday afternoon. \"We either win and stay or you go home.\"\nCueto has long been considered one of the game's dynamic pitchers, his herky-jerky style often giving hitters fits. He was an All-Star a year ago with Cincinnati, and finished second in the NL Cy Young voting, a big reason the Royals were so keen to get him.\nBut when it comes to the playoffs, things have been a struggle. Cueto is 0-2 with a 5.52 ERA in four postseason starts, including a pedestrian outing in Game 2 against Houston.\nWhile he retired 12 of the final 14 hitters he faced, Cueto also gave up four runs on seven hits and three walks in just six innings. It took the Kansas City hitters and some solid innings from his bullpen to get no decision in a 5-4 victory that evened the series.\nCueto acknowledged his looming free agency has been on his mind, but he also said there are no excuses if he fails to live up to expectations tonight.\n\"The fact of the matter is, I have to focus on pitching here and performing for this club and this organization,\" he said. \"Thank God, the most important thing is I feel good. I feel healthy. And that gives me an opportunity to have success.\"\nThe Royals have won nine of their past 10 elimination games, and have momentum on their side. Their rousing comeback to force the series back to Kansas City drew comparisons to their comeback against Oakland in last year's wild-card game, when they dug out of a similar four-run hole in the eighth inning against Jon Lester and the A's.\nThe young, almost naive bunch of guys in the Kansas City clubhouse kept riding that momentum all the way to Game 7 of the World Series, where they finally lost to San Francisco.\nThe situation right now? Solving a pitcher who shut them down less than a week ago.\nMcHugh allowed two runs — both on homers by Kendrys Morales — and six hits over six innings against the Royals in Game 1, shrugging off a 49-minute rain delay in the process.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:17:13.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
