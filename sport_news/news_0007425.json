Coach Mike Bobo has stated all week he expects Dawkins to play, hinting they'd be cautious with him to keep Dawkins from pushing himself too far. \nZerblis was the only one who played last week, opening up playing time for George Maumau and Steven Walker as fullbacks in some two-back sets. Walker even had a carry, good for 4 yards. Those are roles they can fill again this week. \nBobo has been impressed with the attitudes of both — Walker for working hard despite moving down the depth chart, Maumau for fighting through a series of injuries. \n\"We wouldn't have won that game if it wasn't for Steven and what he did,\" Bobo said. \"Now that puts us even farther ahead for this week.\" \nHaving Dawkins back should help lighten the load on Jasen Oden Jr., who has piled up 55 carries in the past two weeks. It's the most carries in two weeks for a CSU back since Kapri Bibbs had 68 in games against Nevada and New Mexico in 2013. Those capped a five-game stretch where he averaged 31 carries a game. \nZerblis is considered questionable, meaning Trae Moxley, Kevin O'Brien and even true freshman Colby Meeks are getting prepared. \n\"We're always practicing guys, and you say be ready, you never know when your opportunity is, but I think Coach (Will) Friend has always done a nice job preparing guys, even if they're twos,\" Bobo said. \nTravel squad — Colorado State took 70 players to the UTSA game last week, but will have to cut that number to 68 to meet Mountain West rules. Bobo said it will be a tough cut, decisions that will come down to special teams. \n\"It's really tough, because a lot of it always comes down to special teams, and guys that are going to be players on special teams are the guys you're going to take,\" Bobo said. \"If a guy might be a borderline second-team, third-teamer, you're going to take the special team (guy) over him.\" \nBobo is just glad the conference bumped the number to 68 this year, as opposed to the 64 last season. At Georgia, 70 traveled. \n\nFORT COLLINS — Kyler Fackrell couldn't wait to get back. \nUtah State's standout linebacker missed all but the first half of the Aggies' first game last year, and when this season kicked off, he felt he was ready to go. The first game with Southern Utah wasn't up to his standards, but as Utah State is set to open Mountain West play by hosting Colorado State on Saturday (5 p.m.; ESPN3.com ), he said he's back in the swing of things. \nWhich is good for him — definitely good for the Aggies — as this is an opponent he likes to face in the type of game he likes to play. Part of it is the physical nature, but he also likes the fact Colorado State has a balanced attack, one he says the Aggies rarely see. \n\"They're a team that likes to line up and run the ball right at you, kind of old- school football,\" Fackrell said. \"We like that, and we like that challenge. They just kind of line up and say, 'We're tougher than you, we're going to run the ball straight at you.' \n\"That's something they've always done, and they've had very physical, mean O-linemen and good runners, and they have that again this year. Hopefully we can have the same success, do our assignments and be gap sound in the run game.\" \nBy the end of the past two games between the two team, the Aggies have made the Rams a one-dimensional offense, stripping away Colorado State's run game. Two years ago, the Rams rushed for 38 yards, averaging barely more than 1 yard per carry and were shutout in Logan in the process. Last year, CSU rushed for 75 yards (1.9 per), needing a late strike from Garrett Grayson to Rashard Higgins to set up Jared Roberts' game-winning field goal in a 16-13 win. \nThose were two offenses that averaged better than 30 points per game. \n\"I think we've played good defense the last four years here at Utah State, and we've played well against the run,\" USU coach Matt Wells said. \"It's all about being able to stop the run and control the pass a little bit has been our philosophy.\" \nCSU coach Mike Bobo doesn't see anything different this year when he watches tape. The Aggies may be 1-2, but they've played well in losses to Washington and No. 10 Utah, allowing just 107 yards per game on the ground. Utah State throws multiple fronts and looks at teams, creating chaos for offensive lines and the run game in general. \nFor the CSU line, it's as much a mental assignment in recognizing keys as a physical test. The fact the Rams haven't won those battles the past two years doesn't sit well, either. \n\"For sure. They're definitely a physical front, and they throw a lot of different stuff at you,\" center Jake Bennett said. \"Not only do you have to screw your cleats in and get ready for them to come at you, you've got to be on the mental side too. You've got to be on film all week to make sure. \n\"For any football game, it's important to do that, and especially against these guys. The last two years we haven't really been able to get it going. This year is another challenge, and hopefully we can get it going. That's on us, for the most part. It definitely reflects on us, so with that not rolling, it just makes you want to do it more.\" \nColorado State has leaned on the running game this season, averaging 194.5 per game on the ground and doing it with different backs. Dalyn Dawkins rushed for 118 in the loss to Colorado, but a week later, it was Jasen Oden Jr. rushing for 143 on 30 carries. Both are expected to play this week, which will help. But the Rams could still be missing two key cogs in the run game, fullback Nu'uvali Fa'apito and tight end Nolan Peralta, both of whom missed the win over UTSA with concussions. \nNothing will come easy, and Bobo is stressing to his team not to force matters, either. \n\"We've got to realize everything is not going to work,\" he said. \"You've got to reserve the right to punt at times. The main thing is don't turn a bad play into catastrophe.\" \nHe also noted when the chances present themselves to be brilliant, the Rams have to take advantage. It's what helped win the game last year, from the first play — a 69-yard hookup between Grayson and Higgins to set up the first score — and their connection on the second-to-last play. \nHiggins had 10 catches in the game for 187 yards, so he knows of what his coach speaks. \n\"I've been preaching that to the wideouts, and Coach (Alvis) Whitted has as well,\" Higgins said. \"He said if anybody is going to get it done, it's going to be this group, which is the YAC (yards after catch) boys. We've just got to make plays when the ball comes to us, and we know it's going to come to us. We've just got to be prepared for it.\" \nMike Brohard: 970-635-3633, mbrohard@reporter-herald.com and twitter.com/mbrohard Utah State's Kyler Fackrell, right, and Ricky Ali'ifua force Washington quarterback Jeff Lindquist to fumble in their game earlier this year.
