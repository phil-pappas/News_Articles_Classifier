Tom Hallman Jr./The Oregonian What downtown Portland is each weekday morning is a place where people are focused on getting to someplace they are not: From the garage to the office, from the office to the coffee shop, from mass transit to the building.\nSo it makes sense that few people notice what takes place at 7 a.m. in front of the Wells Fargo bank building on Southwest Fifth Avenue, right across from City Hall. With no pomp or circumstance, two security guards quietly and quickly raise the American flag.\nTo stand and watch, to be surrounded by the rush and noise of a city waking up, is to be reminded of something large and unifying.\n\"I like to see it go up,\" says Fransisco Menezes, 51, who works for G4S Secure Solutions, a company that has the contract at the bank tower.\nMenezes was born in Brazil, and moved to Portland with his parents when he was 13.\n\"The flag means something to me,\" he says. \"It represents my adoptive country.\"\nJob done, he and his partner walk away.\nCity life continues.\n--Tom Hallman Jr.\nthallman@oregonian.com; 503 221-8224\n@thallmanjr", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T19:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T08:36:21.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
