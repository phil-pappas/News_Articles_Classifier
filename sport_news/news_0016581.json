Now, Kraus has curated an ambitious season-long project called \"Trisha Brown: In the New Body.\"\nThe performance component of this celebration begins next Sunday, when Brown's company will present selected early pieces at the Barnes Foundation. Mid-career works by Brown will be highlighted at Bryn Mawr College Oct. 23-24, and the project will close in grand style in June, when the Pennsylvania Ballet presents one of Brown's most recent works at the Merriam Theater.\nIn between, there will be lectures, master classes, panel discussions, film screenings, and an exhibition, all of which - thanks to support from Bryn Mawr, the Pew Center for Arts and Heritage, and a half-dozen other supporting institutions - will be offered free.\nThis is an especially good time to present a retrospective of Brown's career. A few years ago, at 76, she announced that for health reasons she would stop creating new pieces. Her company is committed to preserving her artistic legacy through its archives, educational projects, and performances. But there will be no more large-scale tours, so this is the last chance for most Philadelphians to see Brown's work performed by her dancers.\nIn 1962, Brown was a founding member of the pioneering Judson Dance Theater group. These young American dancer-choreographers (including Steve Paxton, Yvonne Rainer, Lucinda Childs, and Twyla Tharp) formed an artistic collaborative in New York's Greenwich Village. In his or her own way, each artist rejected the standard elements of Western theater dance: narrative, symbolism, elaborate sets and costumes, traditional music, and technical virtuosity. Instead, their works offered abstract, stripped-down movement, typically based on the repetition of a few basic movement phrases. If this sounds familiar, it's because this is what's now known as \"postmodern\" dance.\nAudiences may be more familiar with Twyla Tharp, who has choreographed for Broadway, films, and television, or Childs, whose work was featured in this year's Fringe Festival. But, as Kraus pointed out in a recent interview, Brown \"developed a new physical language . . . that was unique and especially significant . . .. She knows how to impose impossible demands on the body\" - like falling, or hurtling yourself through space - \"and see how the chips fall.\"\nInnumerable YouTube videos and written descriptions show just how daring Brown's experiments were. Now-classic pieces from the 1960s and '70s were originally presented in \"alternative\" indoor and outdoor spaces without music by barefoot dancers wearing loose shirts and sweatpants. Some of these works defy gravity, like \"Walking on the Wall,\" in which dancers (in expertly rigged harnesses) move with their bodies parallel to the floor. Other early pieces place Brown's dancers on city rooftops, lying on the grass, or floating in water. These artistic decisions - outrageous for the time - were never gimmicks. Rather, they reflected Brown's rigorous, scientific approach to dance-making.\nIn a 1999 Italian TV documentary, Brown spoke eloquently about her work. Tall, slim, and elegantly dressed, she discussed her signature solo, \"Accumulation,\" from 1971. In it, she makes a small movement with both arms, then adds a second gesture using her right arm. She keeps adding elements until she has created a lengthy movement phrase, always returning to that initial motion. At first, this piece seems casual, but it is extremely precise; Brown hits exactly the same mark every time. As a result, viewers focus on her movement rather than on Brown herself. She explains: \"The underpinning of my work is to create a structure, or an architecture, that's solid. You can see it.\"\nCritics have long noted the paradoxical nature of Brown's choreography. Often described as \"brainy,\" it is also sensuous. The deadpan expressions that characterize her pieces, and their lack of traditional subject matter, could appear cold. But, Brown notes, \"People say there's no emotion in abstraction. [In fact] there is a fullness of presence . . . that is truly beautiful and, for me, it's filled with feelings.\"\nHumor is also important. You can see that in titles like \"I'm Going to Toss My Arms - If You Catch Them They're Yours\" and in unexpected musical juxtapositions, like her \"Spanish Dance,\" performed to Gordon Lightfoot's folk ballad \"Early Morning Rain.\"\nIn the 1980s, Brown began creating work for the proscenium stage. She even choreographed for operas, and worked for the first time with a ballet troupe. But she never stopped innovating. Her 1994 piece \"If You Couldn't See Me\" is a mesmerizing solo danced entirely with Brown's expressive back facing the audience. For other pieces, she has collaborated with such visual artists as Robert Rauschenberg and Elizabeth Murray, and worked to music by composers from Monteverdi to Laurie Anderson.\nAfter nearly 50 years of creating, Brown is internationally recognized, especially in France, where she has won numerous governmental honors. Here at home, she's received honorary doctorates, the National Medal of Arts, and a MacArthur Award.\nLast year, Alastair Macaulay, chief dance critic for the New York Times, said of Brown: \"No choreographer who has come along in the last 30 years has done half as much to extend our idea of what dance can be.\" Just so.\nNancy G.
