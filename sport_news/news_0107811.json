My sincere gratitude to God and everyone involved in the take over process. \n“Securing Clube Desportivo Feirense was the next step in the right direction for me. I love everything about the club: the organisation, the philosophy and the fans I have no intention of changing anything in the club because I am satisfied with their operations. \n“Rather, I want to ensure the progress of the club through promotion to the Portuguese Primera division. \n“Having been involved in Nigerian football over the years by running Remo Stars Football club, I felt it was time to further develop the team. It would also bring benefits for Nigerian football through players transfer, training for officials and administrators, who have proven they have what it takes to succeed in Europe. \n“I still have my commitment to Remo Stars FC; it is the beginning of all I have achieved in football and I will keep improving the team to get it to the greatest heights. \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
