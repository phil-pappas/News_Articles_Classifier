Molina, who lives on the 2000 block of Wilson Creek Circle in Aurora. He is charged with three felony counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse involving a child 5 years old or older, indecent solicitation/aggravated criminal sexual abuse, and grooming, according to records on file in Will County Circuit Court in Joliet.\nMembers of the Naperville Police Department's High Technology Crimes Unit took Molina into custody Thursday, following a month-long investigation. He is accused of first making contact with the girl in September via a cell phone application, and then having a sexual tryst with her in the parking lot of the AMC Showplace Naperville 16 movie theater complex, in the Naperville Crossings shopping center, at the northwest corner of 95th Street and Route 59.\nPolice learned of Molina's alleged intentions when the girl's mother \"decided to look into her daughter's activity on her cell phone,\" a police release read in part. The mother, \"upon discovering the alarming solicitations from Molina,\" contacted police, the release stated.\nMolina allegedly used the screen name \"Michael Leotta\" on various cell phone applications, including \"Whiplir\" and \"Kik,\" the release continued. \"He had several, inappropriate texting conversations\" with the girl, \"and persuaded her to meet with him on two occasions.\"\nPolice said Molina, during the second meeting, convinced the girl to get inside his vehicle with him. They then \"parked in the parking lot of the theater, and sexual conduct occurred,\" according to the release.\nMolina was interviewed at his workplace in Oswego before being arrested, police said. Two warrants were then used to search his home.\nAn examination of court documents revealed Molina has no criminal record in Will, DuPage or Kane counties.\nThose who have information about Molina or the alleged alias \"Michael Leotta\" were asked to contact police Detective Rich Wistocki, at 630-305-5384.\nPolice also are inviting parents and children to attend the annual Kids Matter 2 / Parents Matter 2 \"Smart Parenting Doesn't Stop Here\" safety education seminar, which deals with Internet safety and cyber bullying, among other topics. It is set for 7 p.m. Oct. 27 in the Council Chambers of the Naperville Municipal Center, 400 S. Eagle St.\nwbird@tribpub.com\nCopyright Â© 2015, Naperville Sun Sexual Assault Crime Naperville Aurora", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562199f8/turbine/ct-nvs-naperville-sex-suspect-st-1018-20151016"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:27:52.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
