It has been a rough first five weeks as the team has lost their last three games as well as three of their offensive playmakers - Dez Bryant, Tony Romo, and Lance Dunbar. But life goes one, and with plenty of football left, the Cowboys will look to get a boost from several new faces when they return to the field next Sunday against the New York Giants. \nRandy Gregory \nThe Cowboys front office was pleasantly surprised when the Nebraska pass rusher was still available when their second round pick came up in last May's draft. With the pick, the team landed themselves one of the top edge rushers in the draft. Gregory had a great training camp as he added weight to go along with his quick first step. During the preseason he hit the ground running with three sacks. But Gregory's season was put on hold when he injured his ankle in the first game of the season. \nThe rookie will make his return on Sunday when he will get another shot at the Giants. The defense will add him to the pass rushing repertoire that already features Tyrone Crawford, DeMarcus Lawrence, and Greg Hardy. The Hardy return already paid dividends last week as the free agent defensive end sacked Tom Brady twice, hit him five times, and knocked the ball away from him once. With Gregory added to the mix, this defensive line looks to be a fierce group. He will play the role of a pass rushing defensive end where he can stay fresh and play in short bursts. Gregory has demonstrated that he has the strength to go along with his quickness and will be a welcome addition to this group. The defensive line will need to generate a lot of pressure if the team is to have any success going forward. And they certainly have the tools to do it. \nMatt Cassel \nThe biggest change will come in the form of a switch at the quarterback position as Cassel replaces Brandon Weeden. The Cowboys offense has struggled moving the ball over the last two and a half games and Weeden has been unable to stretch the field. The offense has constantly faced heavy run stopping personnel which has stymied any ability to run the ball. Without the running game working, the team must find a way to use the outside of the field and Weeden just wasn't able to do that. \nThe problem with the passing game doesn't fall solely on Weeden's shoulders. Part of the issue has do with the receivers having trouble getting open, but another part of it was Weeden's inability to hit them when they were open. Until Dez Bryant returns, the first problem isn't going anywhere, but the change to Cassel could help with the second part. \nCassel does a great job checking through his progressions quickly so this will help make it more visible when a receiver is able to create separation. Weeden settled too much for short passes underneath. Cassel won't. While he'll still use the short passing game rather often, he should be able to make throws downfield when the opportunities are there. Weeden is also very statue-like when he is standing in the pocket. Cassel is much better at stepping up in the pocket. With an offensive line group that is outstanding in pass protection, this will add another element to the passing game. \nLa'el Collins & Christine Michael \nThese two go together because the metric will be the improvement in the running game and both will play a role. The coaches are constantly looking for ways to make this team better and sometimes the changes are subtle and sometimes they are a little more radical. Make no mistake about it, Jason Garrett and company are exhausting all resources to get things fixed. \nCollins will be replacing Ron Leary at left guard. Leary is coming off a strong season where he solidified himself as a key piece to this offensive line. But he has struggled this season. Leary has been committing penalties and constantly getting beat in the passing game. Collins was initially thought to have a shot at beating out Leary in training camp, but Leary held his own and the coaches kept the unity of the group intact. But the time has come for this change. Collins is a better athlete and while the chemistry might not be there at first, eventually this will be a stronger group. \nThe Cowboys traded a conditional 2016 sixth round pick to the Seattle Seahawks for third year running back, Christine Michael. The new back has only carried the ball once in each of the last two games, but all that is about to change. Michael is expected to have a larger role in the offense and could even take on the starting role. He is a different runner than Joseph Randle and can be more effective pounding through tight running lanes. The Cowboys have no plans to back off of the ground game even though defenses are committing more players at the line of scrimmage. So they might as well get more physical. \nFor more on the Cowboys, be sure to follow Dan Rogers on Twitter @DannyPhantom24 .
