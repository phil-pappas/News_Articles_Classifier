He has a lot of belief in me and plays me in difficult games but I deal with the pressure. \n“My targets are to score goals and do well here. I want to get to the Championship with Walsall.” \nBoss Smith was delighted when the attacking full-back put pen to paper on a new three-year deal at the Banks's stadium two weeks ago. \nThe manager said: \"Rico fully deserves it; he has been excellent,\" said Smith. \n\"He’s a pleasure to coach and a pleasure to have around the place, not just as a footballer but as a person. \n“He’s a quick learner; you give him a bit of information and he takes it on board.\" More on this story:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T10:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:38:09.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
