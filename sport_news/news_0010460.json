The game was close in the opening half, as the Crusaders knocked off a potential Big Pine rally to go into the half leading by two touchdowns. In the second half, the Crusaders changed their offense. Thomas Castillo, in order to avoid aggravating a leg injury, replaced Bryce Benites at quarterback. Immanuel controlled the rest of the contest, as its defense shut out the Warriors. Jacob White slammed the door with two long rushing touchdowns. “Our running game was really strong today,” said ICS head coach Andy Castillo. “This whole week, we worked with a two-minute offense and had lots of conditioning.\" The Crusaders end the season 3-6 overall and 1-2 in Hi-Lo League play.
