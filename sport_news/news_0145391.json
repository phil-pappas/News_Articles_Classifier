Average time of 9-inning MLB game drops 6 minutes to 2:56 1  /  1 Back to Gallery NEW YORK (AP) â€” Major League Baseball has managed to cut six minutes from the average time of a nine-inning game this season, when it adopted some speedup rules.\nSTATS said Monday that the season average ended at 2 hours, 56 minutes. While the average dropped to 2:53 in the first half of the season, it was back at 3:00 after the All-Star break.\nMLB and the players' association agreed this year to enforce the rule requiring a hitter to keep at least one foot in the batter's box in many cases, and they also agreed to post stadium clocks timing pitching changes and between-inning breaks.\nTriple-A and Double-A leagues, the highest levels of the minors, used 20-second pitch clocks and started penalizing violators with balls and strikes. At Triple-A, the International League average dropped 16 minutes to 2:40 and the Pacific Coast League fell 13 minutes to 2:45.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T14:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:42:58.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
