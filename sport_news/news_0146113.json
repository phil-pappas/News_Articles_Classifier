The noodle manufacturer also raised doubts on the samples collected by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India and claimed that these might have been tampered with.\nThe commission's bench, headed by Justice VK Jain, fixed the matter for October 15 for further hearing.\nCiting Bombay High Court order, the company sought to recall an earlier NCDRC order by which it had admitted the government's present suit against the noodles manufacturer.\nIn its petition, Department of Consumer Affairs has alleged that Nestle India had \"indulged in unfair trade practices by false labelling of Maggi Noodles in as much as it states 'No added MSG' prominently on packet, despite presence of MSG.\"\nThe department has also alleged that the company sold \"defective\" goods to the public by selling Maggi noodles with the presence of lead and MSG and indulged in unfair trade practices by offering for sale Maggi Oats Masala Noodles with Tastemaker without risk assessment and product approval.\nIt also sought a direction to the company to recall all \"defective\" and \"hazardous goods\" with respect to Maggi noodles with Tastemaker in all its variants and Maggi Oats Masala Noodles with Tastemaker, and sought a direction to it for issuance of corrective advertisement to neutralise the effect of the misleading advertisements.\n\"This commission be pleased to direct the opponent company to remove 'No added MSG' from the packets and labels of all the variants of Maggi noodles.... This commission be pleased to direct the opponent company to ensure strict compliance with labelling regulations for its entire range of products,\" the department's complaint, filed before the commission, said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:01:11.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
