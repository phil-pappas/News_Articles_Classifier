Reuters/Albert Gea 2 of 2 right \nMADRID A Spanish court ordered Lionel Messi and his father Jorge on Thursday to stand trial in a tax fraud case and the state attorney said Barcelona FC's star player should serve a jail sentence of up to 22 months if found guilty. \nThe two men are accused of defrauding the Spanish state of 4.2 million euros (Â£2.9 million) in tax from 2007 to 2009. \nCourt documents said the hearings in the case would take place at a court in Vilanova i la Geltru near Barcelona but gave no date. \nThe stance of the state attorney, which defends the interests of the Spanish state, contrasts with that of Spain's public prosecutor, who has said the soccer star should not have to answer the charges as his father oversaw his finances. \nHowever, the public prosecutor this week recommended a jail sentence of 18 months and fines of more than 2 million euros for Jorge Messi in the tax fraud case. \nMessi and his father have already paid 5 million euros to the tax authorities as a \"corrective payment\" after they were formally charged in June 2013. \nA Spanish court has previously ruled that Lionel Messi, now 28, could have known about and approved the creation of a web of shell companies allegedly used to evade taxes on income from image rights. \nRevenue was hidden using companies in Uruguay, Belize, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, according to the prosecutor's office. \nLionel Messi, an Argentinian, has been resident in Barcelona since 2000 and has had Spanish citizenship since 2005. \nHe is 10th on Forbes Magazine's list of the world's highest-earning athletes over the past decade, with income of $350 million. \n(Reporting by Iain Rogers , Sonya Dowsett and Elisabeth O'Leary, editing by Pritha Sarkar and Gareth Jones ) \nOur top photos from the past 24 hours.
