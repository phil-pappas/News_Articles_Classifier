While the T-Box set-top offering was marred by unreliable performance and frustrated customers, Roku is widely regarded as the best streaming device on the market by cord cutters in the US, who have dropped their expensive cable TV subscriptions and opted for internet streams instead.\nRoku boasts a rich ecosystem of content-streaming apps that provides everything from HBO Now and live sports to niche media streaming services. It’s backed up by a speedy and easy to use interface and the Telstra TV device marks the first time that Australians could get a taste of what the platform has to offer. The ease of use is an important factor for many users and on that front the Telstra TV certainly ticks all the boxes.\nThe first iteration of the device may be geared primarily towards Telstra’s customer base, but the telco’s long-term plan will effectively see it take on Apple and Google. However, unlike the two tech giants, Telstra faces a tricky balancing act in keeping both the traditional pay-TV model and over-the-top (OTT) streaming content market happy.\nIf Telstra TV proves to be wildly popular, it could potentially exert more pressure on Foxtel — in which the telco has a 50 per cent stake — as customers opt out of more expensive pay-TV subscriptions for an a la carte menu of streaming services. For now, Telstra sees the TV offering sitting side by side with Foxtel and perhaps even serving as a channel that helps Telstra customers realise what they are missing out on.\nSpending some time with the device highlights how Telstra TV’s potential to cannibalise Foxtel customers has understandably tempered the telco’s ambition. The Roku 2, which underpins Telstra’s service, is capable of delivering a lot more than what you get. But Telstra has had to develop the offering in a way that gives customers a taste of wide-ranging content but also gives them incentives to look at a Foxtel subscription to access premium content.\nGone is the much talked about discounted bundle with the big three streaming services — instead you get a rather underwhelming three-month free subscription to Presto and a $15 voucher to BigPond Movies. There are also no unmetered data caps for Netflix. The dedicated Netflix button on the remote that is present on overseas models of the Roku 2 has also been taken out of the equation.\nTelstra’s complicated relationship with Foxtel is perhaps best ­illustrated by the fact that there is no Foxtel Play — a streaming service that allows viewers to watch pay-TV content without the long-term contract or hefty subscription plan. According to Telstra, there are currently no plans to bring Foxtel Play to Telstra TV.\nOn the plus side, live sport, which has long been the biggest drawcard for Foxtel’s pay-TV subscribers, will be making its way to the device. Telstra representatives have confirmed that two of the biggest sporting codes in the country — NRL and AFL — will be available on Telstra TV before Christmas. Hopefully, this paves the way for other sports such as cricket, NBA, MLB and NFL — all of which are currently available on Apple TV.\nCrucially, the Telstra TV offering is missing two of Roku’s best features at launch — universal search and its 1700-strong content app catalogue.\nThere are only 15 apps available at launch, and while Telstra says it plans to fill in the app gap over time, the telco’s own content ambitions and the Foxtel complication is likely to limit the number of apps that eventually show up on the device.\nTelstra TV also launches at a tricky time, falling within the very same week as Apple’s eagerly anticipated new Apple TV launches in Australia and runs the risk of being drowned out almost completely by the tech giant’s marketing muscle.\nWhile the asking price is steeper than Telstra TV’s $109, the rebooted Apple TV promises an unrivalled selection of content with an iOS-esque App store, Siri for natural language voice search in addition to a motion and touch-enabled remote for casual gaming.\nThe Telstra TV offering might be enough to keep Telstra’s existing broadband customers happy and the telco’s decision to partner up with Roku is definitely the right one. But it needs to do much more if it hopes to become a viable competitor to the new Apple TV.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-27T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:18:05.212+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
