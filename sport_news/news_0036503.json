It made him the winningest quarterback in team history with 102. \nDonnell was between Antoine Bethea and NaVorro Bowman, two of the 49ers’ best defenders, when he leaped to snag the pass in the back of the end zone before falling on his back. \nNew York (3-2) has won three straight and leads the NFC East. San Francisco (1-4) has lost four in a row and let this one slip away after an impressive comeback. \nCarlos Hyde’s 2-yard run with 1:45 remaining gave the 49ers the lead. But without his best weapon, Odell Beckham Jr., for much of the final series, Manning engineered his 27th comeback victory in the fourth quarter or overtime. \nBeckham set up New York’s first touchdown with a 31-yard reception down the middle. His 17-yard score late in the third quarter gave the Giants a 20-13 lead. \nHe left because of a hamstring injury, however, and returned only briefly on the final drive.
