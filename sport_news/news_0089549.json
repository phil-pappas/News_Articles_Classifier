THE CANADIAN PRESS/Graham Hughes Photograph by: Graham Hughes , THE CANADIAN PRESS \nWith the way the Saskatchewan Roughriders’ 2015 season had gone, we had to expect a major shakeup of personnel at the CFL trade deadline. \nIt wasn’t that running back Jerome Messam had been traded to Calgary or that quarterback Kevin Glenn was on his way to Montreal that was so shocking to me. It was that the Als announced that Glenn would be starting in Sunday’s game against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats! \nGlenn is in the CFL’s top 10 all-time in passing yardage and has played in just about every system (and city) in the league, so if anyone could do it, it would be him. But how could any quarterback be ready for a late-season football game with playoff implications in just three days? There’s just too much to know for a quarterback! \nI would have understood if Messam was slated to play for the Stampeders on Saturday. As a running back, there is a lot more ‘free play’ and use of their natural athleticism to make plays. They still need to know concepts, but a running back would only be asked to know the three or four run plays that a team typically has ready and plans on using the most during that week. \nFor the most part, teams in the CFL all use a variation of a zone running scheme, so the plays Messam ran with the Riders would likely be similar to those used by the Stamps — the difference being the terminology. \nHe could learn one of their pass protections, but he also could be subbed out on passing downs. There can be no uncertainty by a player who is assigned to protect the quarterback; we’ve seen what happens to teams when their starting quarterbacks are lost to injury. \nTo oversimplify the running back position: Run left, run right, use the hole as a guideline but follow your instincts and your blockers. \nQuarterbacks, on the other hand, have little room for free play. To be effective, they need to know the playbook inside and out. They need to know where to be and how to get to every handoff with a running back, where to set up to throw within every pass protection, and what every receiver is doing on every play against every different defensive coverage. Then they have to be able to deliver. \nFor a quarterback to have even mild success, he needs to know what everyone is doing and what they are thinking, whereas all the running back needs for statistical success is the ball. \nThe pass game is similar to the run game in that there is only so much you can do on the football field. If one team has success with a route combination, you can be sure that the other teams will be implementing their versions of it the following week. The concepts and routes in Montreal would not be new for Glenn; it would be the terminology — and a lot of it! \nIn Week 15, there is no time on the field to process and translate information. That’s what training camp was for. Players must react. Learning new terminology at this point in the season wouldn’t be like you or me learning a new language, it would be like re-learning English. \nWhen you hear “blue,” a colour instantly comes to mind. Well, in a new offensive system, blue means orange, red means green and orange means purple (but the new team says “Viking” because the Minnesota Vikings are purple — and the quarterback couldn’t say “purple” with his mouth guard in). \nIf this sounds confusing, it’s because it’s Week 15 and players learn terminology on Day 1 of camp. If it doesn’t sound confusing, that’s because I only used three colours and left out any fruits, animals, or countries. (Huh?) \nThere’s a lot for Glenn and Messam to process over the next few weeks as they make a push to the 2015 playoffs. For the Riders, though the schedule may say there are three games left in the 2015 season, that’s just terminology. When they get back to practice after the bye week, we may as well call it Day 1 of 2016. \nWith a season that has felt like a runaway train, without leadership or direction, it’s kind of nice to finally feel like there is a plan in place. \n(I value your feedback at mike.Abou-Mechrek@InvestorsGroup.com )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T15:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:37:43.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
