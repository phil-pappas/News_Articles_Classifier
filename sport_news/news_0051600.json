Paul Ryan will be the next Speaker of the House -- if he wants it -- Republican White House hopeful Lindsey Graham told Boston Herald Radio today.\n“Yeah, if he’ll take it, I think it will be,” Graham said of Ryan today. “... The first thing you have to have is respect and trust. I think he’s earned respect and trust, but I can understand somebody not wanting to deal with the chaos, but I hope Paul will step up.”\nGraham slammed members of the House Freedom Caucus for forcing out Speaker John Boehner and pressuring Kevin McCarthy to withdraw as his successor, but added the group of about 40 ultraconservatives are now out of moves.\n“They’ve fired all their bullets,” said Graham. “Nobody’s going to listen to them anymore, so they don’t have much power left.”\nGraham also predicted the mess will be sorted out by next week, but cautioned Republicans must show the American people they can govern.\n“I think you’re having a breakdown of law and order in the House that will be repaired fairly soon,” said Graham. “I’m confident they’ll find someone in the next couple of days.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:27:07.863+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
