It took Holmes 40 minutes to get the fish to the boat. \"The hard part was getting it into the boat. I grabbed it by the tail a couple of times, but it was just too big to handle. I finally got it by the gill plate and pulled it in,\" he said. For FLORIDA TODAY (Photo: File photo) \nOffshore: Northeast winds will continue to blow out the Atlantic through Sunday. Expect steep seas from five to seven feet. Winds are expected to calm down by the middle of next week, hopefully giving anglers a window to head out to the Gulf Stream. \nSurf: The Atlantic will likely be too rough for effective surf fishing. Anglers casting heavy silver spoons on long rods may find bluefish willing to bite. \nSebastian Inlet: Black drum are starting to make an appearance with the cooling water temperature. Shrimp and cut clams should be fished on bottom rigs in the surf zones adjacent to the rocky jetties. Drum will typically hang out in the deeper areas near the tips of the jetties. A couple fish pushing 40 pounds were caught this week. Nighttime snook action is good during outgoing tides. The fish are hitting bucktails well — a good thing because it's difficult to cast anything else against a 20-knot wind. \nInshore: Don't let the wind keep you at home this weekend — inshore fishing has been excellent throughout the lagoon and water levels are returning to normal. Crane Creek, Turkey Creek and the St. Sebastian River are loaded to the brim with finger mullet, drawing snook , tarpon, ladyfish and jacks to these darkwater haunts. Snook catches are good along the mangrove-lined shorelines between Melbourne and Sebastian. Pitch DOA shrimp or live mullet under overhanging mangroves. Redfishing has been good around mangrove islands and narrow cuts in the Thousands Islands area of the Banana River in Cocoa Beach and around the Honest Johns Canals in Melbourne Beach. Live shrimp, cut mullet or a white soft plastic on a <AF> 1/8 <XA> -ounce jighead won't be ignored. Bull redfish are hitting cut mullet in Haulover Canal, but try Oak Hill and the maze of islands in the northern portion of the Mosquito Lagoon for slot-sized fish. \nFreshwater: Topped-out hydrilla and eel grass beds on Farm 13/Stick Marsh are holding good numbers of bass. Focus on shallow areas of the lake, especially at the southern end. These recent winds have helped oxygenate the water and move baitfish around, too. Use only weedless baits or topwaters to avoid snagging stumps and vegetation. 1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.flatoday.com/1RZKnm3 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:08:12.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
