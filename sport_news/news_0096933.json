Just because they both were once MLB pitchers doesn't necessarily mean they have the proper powers of diagnosis and ability to communicate regarding a wide range of poor performances. There have been too many pitching prospects who have flamed out. Coaching could be involved in the failures. \n— John Rayburn, Greeley \nJohn, we go through this every year. Everyone yells \"fire the coaches!\" It's just not that simple. \nDeveloping pitchers is the responsibility of a lot of people: those making the draft picks, those developing pitchers in the minors, those coaching at the big-league level and the pitchers themselves. \nSo I'm not going to point the finger at only Foster and Holmes. As I pointed out in my offseason series the other day, I think the bullpen made some strides late in the season. I think both Foster and Holmes deserve some credit for that. \nThe starting pitching is a disaster, but mostly I blame a lack of talent for that. I will admit, however, that the failure of Eddie Butler and the less-than-impressive summer of Jon Gray shows that the Rockies' message is not getting through to those two. I think Foster has to shoulder some responsibility for that. \nThen again, Foster and Holmes were responsible for rebuilding Chad Bettis during spring training and turning him into a pitcher who was arguably the Rockies' best starter this season. So they deserve kudos for that. \nMr. Saunders! Greetings from a fellow Colorado native and Daily Times-Call alumnus. Baseball is full of curses, \"The Curse of the Bambino,\" \"The Curse of the Black Sox,\" \"The Curse of the Billy Goat,\" and so on. \nI think the Rockies' perpetual woes can be blamed on the Curse of Lanny McDonald. Appropriating the name of Denver's former NHL team, a team that went to the playoffs once in its six seasons of existence DOOMS this team to perpetual ineptitude (and a lousy mascot). \nThe only way to lift this curse is to re-brand as \"The Denver Bears,\" honoring the tremendous and successful baseball legacy Denver had prior to this eggplant-hued disaster in residence. Baseball gods — Tim Raines, Graig Nettles, Warren Cromartie, Andre Dawson, Felipe Alou, Gene Martin — would smile on us. So...could it ever happen? Petition? Pitchforks? New ownership? Thank you! \n— Karl Dworak, Denver \nThanks for writing. \n\"Eggplant-hued disaster?\" Wow, how very, um, poetic of you! \nSeriously, there is no way the name will ever change. Hockey history or no hockey history, I still like the name Rockies. \nNow, if you want to discuss curses, I could see getting rid of Dinger or the Tooth Trot (I can't handle the tooth!). \nThe trade of Troy Tulowitzki was one of the best things the Rockies could have done in 2015. Now they just need to unload Jose Reyes. To do so they should do a package deal with Carlos Gonzalez and Reyes. The Rockies just need to tell everyone that if they want CarGo they have to take Reyes along with his remaining salary. What are your thoughts? It worked for the Braves with Craig Kimbrel and Melvin Upton Jr. \n— Jeff, Aurora \nThat's much easier said than done. You don't say what you want in return. I assume you would go after pitching? \nI think the only way the Rockies will be able to move Reyes is to eat a lot of his salary. If you trade CarGo's contract, along with the money owed Reyes, you would be asking for a team to pick up $81 million over the next two years. I can't imagine any team willing to do that just to land CarGo. Again, it might work if the Rockies eat a lot of salary, but owner Dick Monfort doesn't operate that way. \nIf Dick Monfort ever decides to hire a team president, the role Kelli McGregor held, I nominate Clint Hurdle. The man's intelligence, experience in baseball, including Denver, and thirst for knowledge would make him a good fit. Your thoughts? \n— Dave, Fort Collins \nDave, I like and respect Hurdle, and I know he loves Colorado. However, I don't see him leaving Pittsburgh any time soon, and once he's done as a manager I don't think he would want a front-office job. \nPlus, I'm not sure Hurdle would be a good fit as a team president. He's too much of an \"on-field\" baseball man. He interacts well with players and coaches but I just don't see him dressed in a suit and tie working, manning the phones or talking money. It just doesn't fit him. \nAt least that's my opinion. \nStill love our Rockies via MLBTV, but isn't it time to call out Justin Morneau for who he is? First he sits out the final two games in 2014 in order to preserve his batting crown, and now he comes off the DL this year just in time to promote himself for next year's contract. Morneau is all about himself, his stats, his awards, his cash, not about winning and not about his team. We've seen in our Royals what true competitors look like. Morneau isn't. Good riddance. \n— Jason, Kansas City, Missouri \nJason, you are so wrong, I don't even know where to begin. \nFirst of all, it wasn't Morneau's idea to sit out those games at the end of the 2014 season, it was manager Walt Weiss's decision. That's a fact. \nFor you to say that Morneau is not about the team is laughable. Ask anyone on the Rockies and they will tell you that Morneau is one of their best clubhouse guys, and one of the best teachers on the team. Even Ben Paulsen, who lost playing time when Morneau came off the DL, told me that. \nMorneau came very close to seeing his career ending this summer, but he worked his behind off to get back on the field. I salute the Rockies for giving him a chance to give life to his career. And, by the way, Morneau hit safely in 13 of 21 after his return (22-for-67; .328), including three triples. \nPartick, everyone always talks about how the Rockies need pitching. That much is true, but what people are forgetting is they also need a veteran pitcher to show and teach all the young guys how to their job and be professionals. Do you see the Rockies getting one of those guys this winter? \n— Taylor, Englewood \nTaylor, that's a great point. \nI sure hope they do exactly that, but it's tough to find a good pitcher who also doubles as a great clubhouse guy. They don't come cheap. \nPlus, it hasn't worked out in the past. The Rockies brought in Kyle Kendrick this season, in part for the reasons you stated, but he pitched so poorly he was never in a position to influence anybody. \nA few years ago, Jamie Moyer, at age 49, was a good teacher, but again, he was not a good pitcher. \nThe one veteran the Rockies have in their rotation that might fill that role is Jorge De La Rosa. However, De La Rosa is a little to quiet and shy to lead others on that staff. \nPatrick, why isn't Nolan Arenado being considered for the MVP this season? He had 42 home runs and 130 RBIs. Not to mention he is about to win his third gold glove. I know people will say he was on a bad team, but Alex Rodriguez won it in 2003 on a Texas Rangers team that went 71-91. \n— Nick, Denver \nI wrote about this in a recent Sunday column. \nI think Washington's Bryce Harper will win the award, and I think he should win the award. His all-around offensive numbers were better than Arenado's. However, I think a lot of national baseball writers and commentators overlook how game-changing Arenado's defense has become. I'll be disappointed if Arenado is not in the top five of the voting. \nFor more of my argument, please check out my column . \nIs Dustin Garneau showing enough to earn the Rockies backup catcher spot next season? Or will they need to spend money on a free agent such as Michael McKenry to back up Nick Hundley? I'm assuming Tom Murphy needs another year of seasoning at AAA? And that they've given up on Willin Rosario, at least as a catcher? \n— John, Louisville \nBut to answer your question, I think that Murphy will be Hundley's primary backup in 2016 an will likely be Colorado's catcher of the future. I could see Garneau and Murphy both being behind the plate in 2017. \nAnd yes, the Rockies have given up on Rosario as a catcher. \nDenver Post sports writer Patrick Saunders posts his Rockies Mailbag every other week on Tuesdays. \nPose a Rockies- or MLB-related question for the Rockies Mailbag.
