We say fair or not because, there's only so much of that particular factor that is within a program's control.\nAdChoices As coaches often say, you can only beat the teams on your schedule. Once you get the win, it's incumbent upon the teams you've played to hold up their end of the bargain and continue to play well — not that they're thinking of you, of course. As such, the perceived value of certain results will fluctuate as the season plays out.\nWe're only a month into the 2015 campaign, but already the meaningfulness of some games has to be reassessed from the time we first saw them unfold.\nUtah 24, Michigan 17. As impressive as the Utes looked Saturday in Eugene, their Week 1 win against the Wolverines might carry even more weight. Michigan has allowed only 14 points in their three subsequent wins, including last week's whitewash of BYU.\nNorthwestern 16, Stanford 6. Largely dismissed at the time as a function of Stanford being overrated in preseason polls, the Cardinal have since rebounded to win their first two Pac-12 contests, one of which was a road triumph at USC.\nFlorida 14, Kentucky 9. The Gators are supposed to beat the Wildcats by more than that, right? But UK bounced back from that disappointment to take down defending SEC East champ Missouri.\nMichigan State 31, Oregon 28. It was a top-five showdown, and it helped propel the Spartans to the No. 2 ranking. But the Ducks' disastrous night Saturday against Utah dealt Michigan State some collateral damage.\nOklahoma 31, Tennessee 24. It was a nice comeback on the road for the Sooners, but the Vols have proven to be generous with a fourth-quarter lead once again.\nTexas A&M 38, Arizona State 17. That Week 1 romp vaulted the Aggies into the top 25. But the Sun Devils have done little to justify their own preseason ranking since, looking completely overwhelmed on their home field by USC last Saturday.\nTCU 23, Minnesota 17. Minnesota got well-deserved praise for hanging with the Horned Frogs on opening night. The Golden Gophers haven't lost since, but they haven't exactly been overpowering, either. They needed overtime to get past Colorado State then got three-point wins at home against Kent State and Ohio.\nIowa 27, Pittsburgh 24. Right now it's the best of the Hawkeyes' four non-conference wins. Exactly how the Panthers will stack up in the ACC Coastal is a mystery. They'll start to solve it this weekend as they visit Virginia Tech.\nAlabama 35, Wisconsin 17. The Badgers haven't damaged themselves since this predicted Week 1 setback, while the Crimson Tide have plenty of other concerns coming up in the SEC. When all is said and done, we might look back at this one and wonder whether it was a good loss for Wisconsin.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:31:57.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
