McKenna, as had Radnor Township - which is responsible for inspecting restaurants in a county that has no health department - evidently approved of what she saw.\nRadnor officials, who didn't return calls for comment, have cleared the restaurant to reopen, and it will be serving lunch Wednesday.\n\"We were taking this time to complete renovations,\" Huynh said. The owners have spent more than $500,000 to to clean, renovate, and update the 120-year-old building's electricity and plumbing, he said.\nThe kitchen has been sanitized, the floor partially replaced, and equipment updated. The dining area is freshly painted, with new carpets, new cushions in the booths, new window treatments, and new chairs on order, Huynh said.\nThe basement - where officials had found unlabeled food containers, leaking pipes, evidence of bugs and rodents, and general disarray - was spotless and orderly. Boxes, dishes, and linens were stored neatly on shelves, plumbing and electrical fixtures had been replaced, and the floors swept clean.\nExecutive chef Vince Viola, who was busy carving a beef tenderloin in the kitchen, said most of the food would arrive in time for tomorrow's lunch.\n\"Sometimes you see a problem, and sometimes you don't,\" Viola said, talking about the violations. \"We missed it.\"\nBoth Huynh and Viola cited the age of the building, a pest-control company that didn't address issues, and ignorance on their part. They both promised to do better.\n\"We paid the price,\" Viola said.\nMichael Wei, who owns Yangming, as well as Nectar, in Berwyn; Cin Cin, in Chestnut Hill; and Mandarin Garden in Willow Grove, said the closing was a lesson for employees at all his properties.\n\"I've told them to really pay attention to sanitary and cleaning issues and public health,\" Wei said.\nSatisfied with her quick kitchen tour, McKenna, who lives in the Green Hill condominium complex in Wynnewood, said she had faith in the restaurant. However, her friends at Green Hill felt betrayed and believed the facility had placed their health in danger, she told Huynh.\nMcKenna, partial to Yangming's gunpowder chicken and spring salad, was on her way out the door when she encountered Wei.\n\"Are you the owner?\" she asked.\nWei nodded.\n\"Well, you've always run a nice restaurant,\" McKenna said. \"I'll be back tomorrow.\"\nmschaefer@phillynews.com\n610-313-8111@MariSchaefer", "external_links": ["http://www.inquirer.com/local/20150819_Roach_infestation_closes_renowned_Yangming_restaurant.html"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:41:01.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
