In fact, one-hundred minutes didn’t produce a single goal. So, the two were forced into a do-or die shootout to decide their respective seasons. \nAlthough Hartland battled — in so many different ways this season outside of Thursday night’s district semifinal — it would be the Eagles season that came to a sudden end. They took it to the last possible shot, but Walled Lake Northern connected on all of its five penalty kicks to edge the Eagles in the shootout, 5-4, and advance to the district final. \n“Yeah, that’s a tough way to go down,” Hartland coach Andrew Kartsounes said. \nThe coach, who brought the Eagles their first league win in three years, their first winning season since 2008, and within one save by the Walled Lake Northern goalie of potentially advancing to the district finals, was in somewhat of a state of disbelief immediately after the game. \nHartland's Paul Denton (left) battles Arvid Brunsell for the ball during Thursday's district semifinal.

(Photo: Jim Jagdfeld) \nIt was a cruel way to lose, perhaps even worse than if it had been a blowout in Northern’s favor. \nKartsounes' team, which had already posted its best season in recent history with a 10-8-1 record entering Thursday, was on the brink of playing for a district championship. \nInstead, the Eagles — on their home field — are done. They beat Howell in overtime, 4-2, on Tuesday, but couldn’t rally for the goal against Northern, despite controlling possession the majority of the two overtime periods. \n“We had that down part in our season,” said Katsounes, referring to when the Eagles went from 9-3 to 9-8-1 with six winless games and five of them losses, “and I think had we been in this tournament two weeks ago, we wouldn’t have even been here. \n“To see what they had been through and the way they fought — 100 minutes of scoreless soccer — our defense really stepped up today and played so much more solid even than we had been recently. So I was glad we were able to play that way and, even though it’s a loss, we finished strong.” \nAnd they return all but one senior on offense next year. \n“We’re young,” Kartsounes said, “and we’ll be back.” \nBrighton 4, Milford 3, 2 OT \nHARTLAND — The Brighton boys soccer team squandered a two-goal lead with 10 minutes left in regulation. The momentary lapse nearly ended its season abruptly. \nFacing a tough Milford team that finished third in the KLAA West they appeared originally to have Thursday night’s district semifinal locked up, taking a commanding 3-1 lead late in the second half. Then things suddenly took a wild turn as time wound down. \nBrighton's Keegan Gormley slips past Milford defender Ethan Bresnay to score the Bulldogs' first goal on Thursday night.

It ended up surviving the scare with a 4-3 win over the Mavericks to advance to the district championship game at 11 a.m. Saturday against Walled Lake Northern. \nThe goal was scored midway through the second OT. The way the Bulldogs had been playing in the first, it seemed to be only a matter of time. But what a relief it was for Brighton, which had Milford on the ropes before it was saved by the bell in regulation. \n“We played awesome,” Brighton coach Rob Williams said. “We’re happy to be in the finals. But we gotta regroup for Saturday.” 17 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://ldpaa.com/1S02iZy TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:47:26.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
