By Jocelyn Sheets Newton Daily News \nEleven seniors swam their final meet in front of their home crowd Thursday for the NCMP Aquagirls. Ten of those seniors are four-year swimmers for the Aquagirls. \nThe seniors led NCMP to a dominating home victory against Boone in Newton’s YMCA swimming pool. NCMP won the varsity competition, 130-40, and the junior varsity dual, 124-22. \n“I love my whole team, but I’m sad that this is the last home meet for me,” senior Dusti Antle said. Antle has been a force on the NCMP junior varsity this season. “My teammates are always there for me when I hit a hard situation. They always lift me up.” \nAntle laughed off the fact she swam an extra 50 meters Thursday night in the junior varsity 400-meter freestyle race. The counter card was off, and she thought she still had two more laps to swim. Antle was fifth in the race at 7 minutes, 16.67 seconds. \n“Yes, I was happy with the way I swam tonight even with that. I felt really good after the race,” Antle said. \nNCMP won 10 of the 11 races in the varsity and junior varsity divisions. Boone swimmers collected wins in both 400 freestyle races. \nOther four-year senior swimmers on the team are Lynae Doland, Brianna Fuller, Sierra Griffith, Emily Hawkins, Samantha Hedrick, Sydney Jenkins, Kaelee Knoll, Elizabeth Myers and Hannah Rhoads. Amanda Laube is a first-year senior swimmer. \nNCMP senior managers Austin Bunker and Madison Humphrey have been part of the team four years. These seniors along with foreign exchange student Vlada Osadcha, a junior, and senior Grace Coen, who is on the cross country team, were all honored with their parents by the team. \n“It’s a big win for us on a very exciting and emotional night,” NCMP head coach Sarah Patterson said. “The girls gave it everything they had. They raced, had fun, they cried, they laughed — the whole gamut of emotions.” \nRhoads and Jenkins claimed two individual victories each. \nRhoads led a 1-2-4 finish for the Aquagirls in the 200 individual medley race, winning in 2:41.27 followed by Griffith in 2:47.86 and Lindsey Blommers in 2:51.45. The same three competed in the 100 breaststroke won by Rhoads in 1:22.91 followed by Blommers in 1:23.25 and Griffith in 1:24.76 to go 1-2-3. \nJenkins did the same in the 50 freestyle and the 100 backstroke. The 50 freestyle was a close race with Jenkins out touching teammate Alexis Stout — 29.73 and 29.80 seconds — then Boone’s Erin Kokemiller touched the wall at 30.02 seconds just ahead of Knoll, 30.77 seconds. \nIn the 100 backstroke race, the Aquagirls swept the first three places with Jenkins winning in 1:13.19. Knoll was second in 1:18.75 and Sarah Prendergast in third at 1:91.02. \nPrendergast won the 200 freestyle in 2:26.37 with Myers in second at 2:26.49 and Alex Inskeep in fourth at 2:41.19. Emily Miller posted the fastest time in the 100 butterfly in 1:14.35 followed by Myers in second at 1:16.98 and Doland in third at 1:29.60. \nHedrick pulled away from everyone in the 100 freestyle, winning in 1:00.21. Madeline Webb was second in 1:04.68 and taking fourth was Alexis DeVries in 1:11.14. Jessica Zahn placed second in the 400 freestyle in 5:15.57 while Fuller was fourth in 5:47.57 and Inskeep took fifth in 5:49.99. \nThe Aquagirls went 1-2-3 in the 200 medley relay with the foursome of Sydney Jenkins, Rhoads, Hedrick and Stout winning in 2:09.13. Knoll, Blommers, Miller and Webb were second in 2:15.75 while Lakin Jenkins, Griffith, Willa Colville and Zahn combined for third in 2:21.71. \nIt was a 1-2-4 finish for NCMP relays in the 200 freestyle and 400 freestyle events. Hedrick, Miller, Stout and Rhoads won the 200 in 1:56.09. The team of Webb, Myers, Sydney Jenkins and Hedrick won the 400 in 4:18.24. \n“It was a good meet for me, and I got some good times,” Rhoads said. “It was really exciting as a senior for me because I’ve been swimming in this pool for 13 years, and to finish it up surrounded by my teammates was great. The juniors did a great job of making tonight special for us seniors.” \nDoland swam on the winning 200 medley relay team for the NCMP junior varsity. Doland and Fuller were on the winning 200 freestyle relay and Fuller swam on the winning 400 freestyle relay team. \nRhoads said the senior class had gotten close over the four years. She said the seniors were proud of four winning seasons — this year NCMP went 10-1 in dual meets. \n“Our goals for the rest of the season would be win the Ram Relays, win another conference title and finish strong in the regional and state meets,” Rhoads said. \nPatterson said Thursday’s Southeast Polk Ram Relays is one of the favorite meets of the Aquagirls. It is a meet of just relay races. \nThe Aquagirls aim for a fourth straight North Central Swimming Conference championship at the conference meet Oct. 24 at Grinnell College. \nNCMP vs. Boone \nNCMP results \nVarsity \n200-m medley relay: 1.
