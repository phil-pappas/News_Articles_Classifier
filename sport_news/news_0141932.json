The 35-year-old Reinhart and 46-year-old Jockel compromised, marrying at the 8-mile mark of Sunday’s Chicago Marathon in the Boystown neighborhood. \nReinhart wore a white running outfit and held flowers, while Jockel wore a tuxedo T-shirt. They exchanged vows under a garden arch decorated with race medals. The ceremony took less than four minutes. \nReinhart says she got her simple wedding and Jockel got “several thousand guests.” \nChicago Marathon organizers gave the couple customized bride and groom bibs. They toasted with Gatorade. \nThe couple met two years ago through the Chicago Area Runners Association. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:47:24.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
