And of course the Department of Criminal Investigation is investigating that. We're assisting with that and I'm hopeful we'll find out more about it,\" Gov. Daugaard said. \nAngela Kennecke: \"Will the state go back now and look at what happened over the last decade, in previous years to see if there were similar problems with the handling of the money and the grant funds?\" Governor Daugaard: “We’ve already asked the Department of Education and the Department of Legislative Audit to consider looking at all the different contracts we had with Mid Central.\" \nWhen asked if the State Department of Education should have had more oversight -- Daugaard says the DOE was trusting Mid Central with the money. \n\"As a general rule, we had not had problems in South Dakota contracting with government entities--they're among the most trustworthy. Whether there's been an exception here and there's been wrongdoing--we'll learn,\" Daugaard said. \nAngela Kennecke: \"What about going back a decade--8 or 9 years--and taking a look over these past several years at the GEAR UP grant specifically?\" Governor Daugaard: \"There's no plan to do that right now.\" \nIn a letter to the legislative audit committee, Daugaard says that the current ongoing legislative audit of Mid Central is expected to go to the audit committee later this month. Daugaard says he's also asked Attorney General Marty Jackley to look into any evidence of wrongdoing in the administration of GEAR UP. \nStacy Phelps has resigned from the State Board of Education. Phelps, who administered GEAR UP, also ran Scott Westerhuis' American Indian Institute for Innovation. \nPhelps was also listed as the president of Westerhuis' consulting firm. Gov. Daugaard said that Phelps' involvement with GEAR UP would have been a distraction for the board.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:15:13.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
