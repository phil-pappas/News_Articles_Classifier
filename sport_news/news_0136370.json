That secured the program’s 25th sectional championship overall and third in as many years. \n\"It’s exciting for the girls who’ve been here for the three years, equally exciting for the girls who are new,\" Kirtane said. \"That first year really set a bar, the second year showed that they can maintain it and this third year shows they can maintain and take it to another level.\" \nEven though the Maroons did not get wins from their top players at first singles and first doubles, the No. 1-seeded team’s depth proved essential in the championship contest. \nJunior Alex Absey defeated No. 3 Livingston’s Vivian Lin, 6-1, 6-1, just minutes after the second-doubles pairing of juniors Kat Bonfiglio and Kelly Rekucki won their match, 6-1, 6-2, to seal the victory for the Maroons. \nFreshman Emma Hultqvist picked up Ridgewood’s other win at second singles, beating Nicole Bazhenov, 6-1, 6-0. \n\"I don’t think anyone would say that there’s a position that’s most important or a position that always needs to win for us to clinch a match,\" senior captain Elizabeth O’Keefe said. \"I think something that’s really special about our team is that every single girl goes onto the court wanting to win and expecting that from themselves.\" \nThe first-doubles tandem of O’Keefe and Sophia Swanson fell to the duo of Chelsea Dyapa and Jacqueline Gelman, 6-3, 6-2, in the final. Meanwhile, sophomore Julia Yoon put up a good fight at first singles against Elaine Vernoff before losing, 6-3, 6-4, in a match that lasted nearly two hours. \n\"We really earned this one, because every spot has clinched at different points,\" Kirtane said. \"And that’s really exciting that each position, each of them has gotten us to the point that we’re at.\" \nKirtane also noted this team’s youth as a major difference from the past two championship squads, and highlighted the importance of O’Keefe, the team’s lone senior, who has played a valuable role both in the lineup and as a team leader. \n\"When you lose a number of seniors, it’s always tenuous what’s going to happen thereafter,\" said Kirtane. \"But Liz is a really super role model on and off the court.\" \nO’Keefe and the freshman Swanson enjoyed a tremendous run to the North 1, Group 4 final, losing only three games in their victories over the first-doubles pairs from No. 16 Kennedy, No. 8 Memorial (West New York) and No. 4 Morristown. \nBonfiglio and Rekucki proved to be a force at second doubles throughout the sectional tournament, winning each of their matches. Absey did the same at third singles, while Hultqvist lost only in the semifinals against Morristown. \nThe Maroons’ record stood at 14-3 heading into the State Group 4 semifinals, and with a few makeup matches left on the schedule, the team has a good shot at topping last year’s win total of 14. \nFor Kirtane, now in her ninth season as coach, the past three years have made up for the previous six, in which the Maroons finished on the wrong end of a number of close calls in the state tournament. \nIt’s difficult to remember that just a few years ago, Livingston continually played the role of Ridgewood’s tormentor, as the Lancers knocked it out of the state-sectional tournament five straight years from 2008 to 2012. \nThe Maroons have now taken out Livingston each of the past three season including twice in the finals, and O’Keefe said that Kirtane’s support has made a difference throughout the successful run. \n\"One thing that really makes our team special is our coach,\" the senior said. \"She cares so much and she shows that every day through how she speaks to us on the court, the amount of dedication she shows in practices and matches.\" \nThe only part of recent history that has not gone so well for the Maroons is the results when they’ve reached the ultimate rounds of the State Group 4 tournament in each of the past two years. \nLast season, Ridgewood bowed out in the semifinal to West Windsor-Plainsboro South, 3 1/2-1 1/2, and the year before that, the team dropped a 3-2 decision to Cherry Hill East in the semis. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:28:05.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
