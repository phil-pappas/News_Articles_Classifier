(AP) - An assistant University of Missouri-Kansas City basketball coach has resigned, saying he can't do his job while battling what he called \"false allegations\" that he hired dancers to strip and have sex with recruits while he was a coach at Louisville.\nUMKC announced Andre McGee's resignation Friday. He had been on paid administrative leave since Oct. 2, when the allegations surfaced.\nEscort Katrina Powell has told ESPN that McGee paid $10,000 for 22 shows that took place in a Louisville dormitory from 2010 to 2014. Louisville coach Rick Pitino has denied any knowledge of such parties and said he will not resign.\nMcGee played at Louisville before becoming a graduate assistant coach and director of men's basketball operations. He left the university last year to become an assistant at UMKC.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
