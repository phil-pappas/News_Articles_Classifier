Two-time legislator Kavita Jain, the lone woman minister in the Manohar Lal Khattar ministry, is learning it the hard way as she is trying to find her feet in a state where bureaucracy calls the shots. In spite of the Opposition’s criticism of being “inexperienced”, Jain — who heads three important departments of women and child development, social justice and empowerment, and urban local bodies — has certain “achievements” to her credit. Some of them are the launch of BJP government’s flagship Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao programme and Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana schemes by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Panipat on January 22, and Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme as per which money is transferred in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. Caste calculations, gender and connections of her husband Rajiv Jain, state BJP vice-president, got her the ministerial berth. But she had to deal with the mess created by the previous Congress government in the departments she was allocated. Not only that; handling the bureaucracy posed its own set of problems for the first-time minister. Since empowerment of the downtrodden, women and children had been a tough task in the Haryanvi society, the “teething troubles” for the minister seem to be unabated. In fact, vested interests and the unbridled bureaucracy seem to be making minister’s job even harder. The departments allotted to her earlier — social justice and empowerment and women and child development — kept her busy, while the mismanaged and unwieldy department of the urban local bodies (given to her in March) stretched her to the limit. With urban infrastructure in shambles in the state, Jain is finding it difficult to mobilise resources for the provision of basic amenities in the towns.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:10:52.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
