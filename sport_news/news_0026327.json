And when he stopped, he gave Greg Olsen a hard time for twice being brought down at the 1-yard line before finally getting in the end zone when it mattered most.\nThis one meant a little more for the Carolina Panthers, winning on the home field of the two-time NFC champion Seattle.\n\"This was one of the bigger victories we’ve had since I’ve been here,\" Carolina coach Ron Rivera said.\nNewton capped Carolina’s fourth-quarter rally with a 26-yard touchdown pass to Olsen with 32 seconds left, and the Panthers improved to 5-0, rallying for a stunning 27-23 win over the Seahawks on Sunday.\nDown 23-14, Carolina went 80 yards on each of its final two possessions for touchdowns that left the Panthers jubilant and the Seahawks stinging about a second straight fourth-quarter collapse.\nCarolina winning its first four games was impressive. But this victory adds the validity.\n\"It’s a great win, but it does only count for one,\" said Olsen, the former Wayne Hills star. \"That’s the reality of this business. But it felt good. We’ve had our battles against these guys.\"\nNewton was 12 of 15 for 169 yards in the fourth and threw for 269 yards overall. His first 80-yard drive in the final quarter resulted in Jonathan Stewart’s second 1-yard TD run with 3:55 left to cut Seattle’s lead to 23-20. But Graham Gano pulled the extra point wide left. After Carolina’s ‘D’ forced Seattle to punt, Newton led the final scoring drive.\nCarolina took possession at its 20 with 2:20 remaining and two quick passes got the ball to its 46 at the two-minute warning. Newton hit Ed Dickson to the Seattle 40, but Bruce Irvin sacked Newton back near midfield, forcing them to use their final timeout with 1:20 remaining.\nNewton rebounded to hit Devin Funchess for 16 yards and Jerricho Cotchery caught a contested 7-yard pass. After spiking the ball and moving quickly to the line, Newton saw confusion in Seattle’s secondary, hitting Olsen wide open for the winning score.\nThe reason Olsen was so wide open was mixed signals in Seattle’s secondary. Richard Sherman got one call from the sideline while Earl Thomas and others got a different call. The result was Olsen running uncovered.\n\"You’re not open that much against these guys,\" Olsen said. \"They cover so much ground, there’s usually bodies around you when you catch the ball. But we’ll take it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:38:39.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
