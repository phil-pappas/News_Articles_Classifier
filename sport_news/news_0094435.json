Samiti president Brig (retd) Khushal Thakur said the affected people had been given the right to fair compensation, transparency, rehabilitation and resettlement in the new Land Acquisition Act. But the ground realities were entirely different and the entire process lacked transparency, he alleged. Two months ago, the state government had announced to give four-times the compensation to the affected people. But neither was the issue taken up in the Cabinet, nor was any notification issued. Whereas, states such as Delhi, Haryana, Rajasthan and Maharashtra had announced to give compensation more than four times, he claimed. Moreover, the entire cost of compensation would be borne by the Central Government and the state government had to only disburse it. The affected people were still not aware of the amount of the compensation they would get, Brigadier Thakur said. He alleged that the state government was trying to determine the amount of the compensation on the basis of the circle rates. Instead, it should be determined on the basis of prevalent market value of the land. “Circle rates are kept deliberately low to minimise stamp duty and therefore, the difference between circle rate and prevalent market rate is usually vast,” he said. He maintained that the state government should implement the new land Act that provides compensation four-times of the market value of the land and set up rehabilitation and resettlement mechanism. A notification issued on April 1 by the Centre had reduced the compensation for land acquired to 50 per cent by fixing the multiplication factor as one by which the market value of land was to be multiplied in case of rural areas under the new Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act 2013, the Brigadier said. But, contrary to the provisions of the new land Act, 2013, the state government had adopted the lowest standard of compensation for land acquired for the national highway in the state, he stated. “Many states have already increased the multiplication factor to more than two and it is not understood as to why the state government is adamant and pursuing anti-farmer policies,” he added. Samiti general secretary Brijesh Mahant said the land evaluation process between Kullu and Manali had been started and the government could start disbursing the compensation from the next month. The farmers should also be consulted before fixing the market value of their land, he said. The next meeting of the Samiti would be held at Aut on November 4 to chalk out further strategy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:17:16.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
