The bumpiest moment came in the day’s final set, when they trailed the Indians (28-8), 16-10. \n“After Jade (Putz) got a couple aces there, everything started to click,” Ketchum said. \nWest Delaware closed the match with a 13-3 rush. \n“We had a spell there where we couldn’t serve-receive,” said Marion Coach Roxanne Paulsen. “We couldn’t capitalize on our passing to get to our offense. We’ve got to work on that.” \nAt 18-all, Ketchum called her own number three straight times, and each time she sent the ball to an open back corner. Then she added a block to put the Hawks in command, 22-18. \n“I hadn’t been getting myself involved much, and I saw the opportunity,” Ketchum said. “I knew the corners were open.” \nAt 23-20, the Hawks closed it out with kills by Kristen Wegmann and Ashley Goebel. \nA traditional Wamac power, the Hawks won their first title in seven years last season. Now they’ve won two in a row. \nWest Delaware advanced to the championship match with wins over Center Point-Urbana (25-17, 25-21) and Mount Vernon (25-21, 25-23). Marion swept Independence (25-11, 25-22) and Western Dubuque (25-17, 25-15) to get their first shot at the Hawks this season. \nIf they get another, it will be at the state tournament in November. \n“Obviously, we wanted to win it today,” said Marion’s Alyssa Thomas. “West Delaware’s a great team. They stay calm, they do what they’re supposed to do.” \nBenton Community won the consolation bracket. \nWAMAC CONFERENCE VOLLEYBALL TOURNAMENT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:42:18.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
