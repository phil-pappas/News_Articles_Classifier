Comment Follow @@LDLDanielGreen Posted Sep. 30, 2015 at 6:30 PM The Leesville Wampus Cats received some support from the voters of the Louisiana Sports Writers Association in the most recent football poll. The Wampus Cats (3-1) came in with two points in the voting, good enough for 16th in the Class 4A football rankings. Though they are currently third in the power rankings, the Wampus Cats, who play host to the Iowa Yellow Jackets on Friday, have beaten two Class 5A schools — Alexandria and Pineville — after dropping an overtime decision on the road at South Beauregard in Week 2. Neville is the top-ranked team for the fifth straight week in Class 4A, receiving all 11 first-place votes. McDonogh 35 is now second in the rankings, while Teurlings Catholic, North DeSoto and St. Thomas More round out the top five. Crowley, Bastrop, Franklinton, Warren Easton and Carencro complete the bottom half of the Class 4A rankings. Pickering (3-1), which was ranked 10th last week in Class 2A, dropped its first game of the season, a 9-0 decision at the hands of the Class 4A DeRidder Dragons. As a result, the Red Devils fell out of the top 10 and was replaced by Madison Prep, which is undefeated at 4-0. Sterlington remained atop the Class 2A rankings with eight first-place votes, while Notre Dame of Crowley is second, garnering one vote for the top spot. Ouachita Christian is third, while former No. 1 Many (3-1) is fourth, picking up the other two first-place votes. Riverside, St. Charles, Calvary Baptist, St. Thomas Aquinas and Kinder rank fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth, respectively. South Beauregard (4-0), after winning its fourth straight game against a larger school, jumped into the Class 3A top five, taking over fourth in the rankings. University remained at the top of the Class 3A poll with nine first-place votes, while Amite is second. However, De La Salle (4-0) picked up the other two first-place votes as it moved up to third. Following South Beauregard were Parkview Baptist, Lutcher, Church Point, North Webster, E.D. White and St. James. Rummel remained atop the Class 5A rankings despite losing to an out-of-state opponent last week, while West Monroe and Brother Martin weren’t far behind in second and third. John Curtis was fourth in Class 5A, while Byrd is fifth. In Class 1A, the undefeated St. Mary’s Tigers stayed atop the rankings with nine first-place votes, while second-ranked Southern Lab had one of the two remaining votes for the top spot. Ascension Episcopal, fifth in the poll, got the other vote.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:45:33.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
