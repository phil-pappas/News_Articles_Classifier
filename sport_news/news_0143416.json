Comcast is apparently furious at cord cutters so they're running an experiment where they are now capping unlimited data.\nIf you stream too much video instead of paying them for overpriced TV, well, Comcast is imposing a hard cap and then charging huge overage fees if you go over in select service areas.\n(They probably did a change in their terms of service that took the word \"unlimited\" out. \"Unlimited\" just depends on your definition of the word, I guess.)\nGetty Images Comcast Cable Company Clamps Down\nThey say this is a \"trial.\" I think they want to see what kind of outrage it brings. I believe this to be the height of corporate arrogance from a company that enjoys an idiotic monopoly that only happened because of a grievous error in Congress in the 1980s that granted a monopoly to the cable monsters.\n>> Read more trending stories\nThe trial is going on in the following areas. You can see the exact zip codes here.\nHuntsville and Mobile, Alabama Tucson, Arizona Fort Lauderdale, the Keys and Miami, Florida Atlanta, Augusta and Savannah, Georgia Central Kentucky Maine Jackson and Tupelo, Mississippi Knoxville, Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee Charleston, South Carolina So what should you do if you are in a Comcast service territory that's being impacted? Know their goal is to make it unbelievably painful for you so you'll sign up for their service.\nHere's my solution: Until you are lucky enough to have Google Fiber in your area , go to the monopoly phone company for TV and switch to them instead of Comcast.\nComcast is an embarrassment to the free market. I hold them in utter, complete and total contempt because that's how they hold you. This company should not exist. As I always say, if a Comcast rep wants to come on air and explain their position, I welcome it.
