The Wolverines and their fans went from celebrating an apparent win to stunned, slack-jawed silence.\nThe Spartans’ celebration quickly calmed down, with Watts-Jackson lying prone in the end zone. He was placed on a stretcher and carted off the field by Michigan State’s medical personnel. The Spartans’ coach, Mark Dantonio, said Watts-Jackson had a dislocated hip and was being taken to a hospital.\nThe stunning end capped a week of arguments around the state about which team was better: No. 7 Michigan State, which has dominated the rivalry in recent years, or No. 12 Michigan, which is enjoying a resurgent season under its new coach, Jim Harbaugh.\nIncidents of vandalism occurred on both campuses. The statue of the Spartans basketball great Magic Johnson was doused with Michigan’s maize and blue on Thursday, leading to a wolverine statue being revenge-painted green and white on Friday.\n“We overcame so much,” Harbaugh said after the game, “calls that were made, not made, kept fighting, we played. We ultimately played winning football.\n“What do we say about last plays? This was unfortunate.”\nThe game’s crazy ending capped Michigan State’s fourth-quarter comeback. The Spartans, keyed by the senior quarterback Connor Cook, outscored Michigan by 13-3 in the final 15 minutes.\n Michigan-Michigan State Final Play Related Coverage Pennsylvania 42, Columbia 7: Columbia’s Coach Faces His Old Team, and the Lions Fall Hard OCT. 17, 2015 East Roundup: Orange Fall to Cavaliers in Marathon OCT. 17, 2015 Campus Corner: Tough Times for a Kansas Hangout (When Is Basketball Season Again?)

Since becoming the Spartans’ head coach in 2007, Dantonio has lost to the Wolverines only once, in his first game against them.\nMany of those wins have been lopsided, but these Wolverines do not resemble the troubled teams of Rich Rodriguez and Brady Hoke. Harbaugh’s return to the college where he played quarterback has clearly returned confidence to Michigan (5-2, 2-1), and he has brought the old-school touches of running burly fullbacks on big plays and playing physical, unflashy, trench-warfare-style defense.\nWith less than 10 minutes to go in the game Saturday, Michigan was up, 23-14, and seemed to have all the momentum. But, thanks to a 74-yard pass from Cook to fullback Trevon Pendleton, Michigan State suddenly lowered Michigan’s comfort level. L. J. Scott scored on the next play, paring Michigan’s lead to 23-21.\nAdvertisement\n Advertisement\n But then Michigan’s defense, which had held its opponents scoreless in the three games leading up to the Michigan State contest, tightened up. A Wolverine victory seemed inevitable, until the failed punt in the final seconds.\nAt the start of the game, Michigan quickly showed it was ready to match Michigan State’s aggressive style. The Wolverines’ opening touchdown, scored by the senior fullback Sione Houma in the second quarter, featured grinding play by the Michigan offensive line and Houma powering in fromtwo yards out for the score.\n Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.\nMichigan State responded with its own rushing touchdown, six minutes later, when Scott tied the score at 7-7 with an 11-yard touchdown run. The scoring drive had a contentious element when Joe Bolden, Michigan’s co-captain and leading tackler, was called for a targeting penalty and ejected.\nBolden, who was diving for a tackle, made helmet-to-helmet contact with a sliding Cook. Replays showed Bolden was shoved from behind by the Spartans’ Jack Conklin while he was going in for the tackle, altering his path into Cook’s head.\nThe play was reviewed, but the targeting call stood, leaving Bolden and Harbaugh to express their displeasure at the referee. Bolden left the stadium in dramatic style, taking the long, sideline route while jumping and waving his arms to fire up the pro-Michigan crowd of 111,740.\nMichigan State continued to show the weaknesses on special teams and in wrap-up tackling that have plagued it all season. The punting game was a continual sore spot, made worse by the Michigan sophomore Jabrill Peppers burning the Spartans with a kickoff return of 49 yards and a punt return of 34.\nPeppers, who plays safety, also turned into a key weapon on offense. With the Woverines getting excellent field position after a Michigan State fake punt went awry, Peppers, one of the fastest Wolverines, took a short swing pass and ran it down the left sideline to the 3. Strangely enough, Michigan seemed to score three times, but the first two apparent touchdowns were called back by instant replay before Houma pounded the ball up the middle to give the Wolverines a 17-7 lead.\nMichigan State’s offense recovered under Cook’s steady hand. He lofted a perfect 30-yard pass to Macgarrett Kings, laced over his receiver’s left shoulder and away from the tight Michigan safety, for a touchdown that cut the lead to 17-14.\nAll of that was a prelude to the dramatic ending. It took nearly four hours to play the game — and only 10 seconds to decide it.", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/17/sports/17DURKINweb/17DURKINweb-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://player.performgroup.com/eplayer.js#dca519559397426f84fdebdd14.1eal0h6qxj98o1wgnr5lwjfv1b.s", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/18/sports/COLLEGES/COLLEGES-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/18/sports/18COLUMBIA/18COLUMBIA-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/18/sports/DOG-CAMPUS-1/DOG-CAMPUS-1-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/16/sports/16CALHOUNweb1/16CALHOUNweb1-thumbStandard.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T05:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:11:02.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
