If this Toledo team can avoid a similar fate and run the table, the Rockets will be in contention for the Group of Five automatic bid to one of the college football playoff system’s New Year’s Day bowl games. \nKEY MATCHUP \nLinebacker Jovan Santos-Knox leads a UMass front seven that will have its hands full with a strong Toledo rushing attack led by Terry Swanson (94.4 yards per game) and Kareem Hunt (86.3 ypg). Santos-Knox, among the nation’s top defensive players, recorded 17 tackles in a 15-10 loss to Kent State last week. He may need similar numbers for the Minutemen to pull off an upset. \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nToledo: In Swanson and Hunt, the Rockets have two of the top six Mid-American Conference rushers. Swanson filled in admirably for an injured Hunt, a preseason All-America candidate, and forced coach Matt Campbell to keep him in the rotation. They provide half of a balanced offense alongside quarterback Phillip Ely, who averages 229.8 yards passing per game. \nUMass: Quarterback Blake Frohnapfel had plenty of success against the Rockets a year ago, throwing for 438 yards and five touchdowns in a 42-35 loss in Toledo. Frohnapfel’s favorite target is Tajae Sharpe, who holds school records for receptions and yards receiving. He’s averaging a nation-best 10.8 receptions per game. \nFACTS & FIGURES \nThe game will be played at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro. The Minutemen are playing three home games this season on campus at McGuirk Stadium and three at the home of the New England Patriots. . Toledo is tops in the MAC and No. 7 nationally in scoring defense, allowing 13.2 points per game. The Rockets will be without leading tackler Jaylen Coleman, who broke a leg last week against Eastern Michigan. . Toledo has not allowed a sack in 206 passing attempts this season. Air Force, which has just 65 pass attempts, is the only other team in the country that hasn’t allowed a sack. \n___ \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:40:22.571+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
