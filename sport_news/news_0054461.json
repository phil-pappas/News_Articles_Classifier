The only component that’s left is someone out there knows who these people are. They are threatening your streets, your family and you need to come forward,” Councilman James Gray said.\nA $30,000 reward is on the line, and Darlene Cusanza with Crimestoppers says the large pot of money did generate more calls.\n“We’re appreciative of those who called with possible names and possible vehicles. That is all being vetted by law enforcement. What the key is here, is that the public is stepping up,” Cusanza said.\nPolice have not been able to link the armed robberies at Patois, Atchafalaya and Monkey Hill because of a lack of evidence, but investigators also recognize the similarities in the cases. If those arrested are responsible for all three robberies, the tipster will receive the full $30,000.\nCusanza points out that now is the time to support those establishments affected by the armed robberies, but at the same time, it’s important to take precaution.\n“Certainly, using good judgement, limiting what you bring, too. I mean, if you’re going to dinner, you may want to consider limiting it to one credit card or just a little bit of cash,” Cusanza said.\nShe wants to stress, though, that the victims in these armed robberies did the right thing.\n“They complied with the wishes of these robbers, and that’s why it was just a robbery and no one was harmed. I think our first reaction is yes, I’m frightened and I want to bring a gun with me. The statistics show that if you just comply, it ends up being safer for everyone,” she said.\nShe says that with the combination of the federal and local help, she believes the gunmen will be caught.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
