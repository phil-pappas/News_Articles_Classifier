It's the same calf that prevented him from participating in the Mavs' first four preseason games and the same calf he strained last season while playing for the Brooklyn Nets.\nWilliams' injury history is a concern.\n\"Concerned, but I believe we're going to get the thing resolved,\" coach Rick Carlisle said after Sunday's practice and before the Mavs flew to Cleveland for Monday's game against the Cavaliers at Quicken Loans Arena. \"We're still 10 days away here 1/8from opening night3/8. We've got time.\"\nMaybe, but the Mavs (0-4 preseason) may need to start ramping up things with their other point guards in case Williams isn't ready for the opener against the Suns. That means the onus could be on J.J. Barea, Devin Harris and Raymond Felton.\nAnd also on shooting guard John Jenkins, the Mavs' leading scorer in preseason who has received more than his fair share of duty running the offense during the first four games.\n\"We've got a lot of guys that are doing good things,\" Carlisle said. \"Jenkins has certainly been a bright spot.\"\nWilliams signed a two-year, $11 million contract with the Mavs this summer after he received a $27.5 million buyout from the Nets. The Mavs are hoping he can return to the form that earned him three straight All-Star berths from 2010-'12.\nA strained right calf and fractured rib cost Williams 14 games last season.\n\"It's been a frustrating thing for him, but we're making progress and we'll get there,\" Carlisle said. \"It's just there and we've got to get it out of there, and we'll get there.\n\"He's very disappointed. He wants to be out here with us playing, but he's a veteran guy and he's watching everything and on a limited basis he's doing what he can do to stay connected.\"\nCarlisle doesn't have an exact timetable for Williams' return.\nIf Williams isn't ready for the opener, forward Dirk Nowitzki is confident that Harris, Barea or Felton can run the show for the Mavs and keep things afloat until The Colony native is able to play.\n\"We've got a bunch of veteran, savvy guards,\" Nowitzki said. \"All three 1/8point3/8 guards that are left are over 30, have been around the block, have been starters at times. So whoever is going to play is going to fill that role.\"\n(c)2015 Fort Worth Star-Telegram\nVisit the Fort Worth Star-Telegram at www.star-telegram.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1739842", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1739842&h=Mavericks%27+Deron+Williams+out+for+remainder+of+preseason+games", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1739842&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:43:09.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
