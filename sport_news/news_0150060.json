Not only did Gordon have advice, he had a pitch — Hendrick Motorsports was going to expand to four cars and Johnson was their man. \n“From that moment on, my head spun around on my shoulders,” Johnson said. \nJohnson’s been turning heads on the track ever since he landed a ride with racing powerhouse Hendrick Motorsports. \nHe started three times in 2001 and flashed some early championship potential with his first win just 10 races into 2002. With crew chief Chad Knaus calling the shots, Johnson has driven the No. 48 Chevrolet to six championships and 74 career wins, including a track-record 10 at Dover International Speedway. \nAs NASCAR champions Tony Stewart and Gordon ready for retirement, the 40-year-old Johnson shows no signs of following their path and calling it quits any time soon. He’ll make his 500th career start today at Dover after recently signing a two-year extension with team owner Rick Hendrick. \n“The racing God’s have smiled on me and this team,” Johnson said. \nJohnson’s numbers long ago stamped him a surefire Hall of Famer. Among his achievements: \n— 6. Johnson won championships in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2013, putting him one shy of matching Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt for most on the career list. \n— 74. Johnson’s 74 wins trail only Gordon (92) among active drivers. He’s eighth on the career list and has Earnhardt (76) in his sights. He’s won at least two races in every full season, won 10 in 2007 and has four this season. \n— 1. Crew chief. Not counting some races missed because of suspension, Knaus has been a constant presence atop the pit box for Johnson since 2002. Johnson and Knaus were almost split by Hendrick following the 2005 season, but Hendrick made them hash out their differences over a snack of milk and cookies. They went on to win a record five consecutive titles. \n— 10. Johnson has mastered the art of winning NASCAR’s crown jewel races. He won the Daytona 500 in 2006 and 2013; the Coca-Cola 600 in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2014; and the Brickyard 400 in 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2012. \nRegan Smith wins Xfinity race \nRegan Smith strengthened his NASCAR Xfinity Series championship push with a victory Saturday at Dover International Speedway. \nSmith won for the second time this season and moved within 36 points of series leader Chris Buescher with five races left in the season. \nSmith would love to add a championship to his resume. He faces an uncertain future with JR Motorsports after the organization signed Elliott Sadler for next season. \nDenny Hamlin was second, followed by Kyle Busch, Ryan Blaney and Kyle Larson. Buescher finished eighth and has a 24-point lead over Chase Elliott. \nFORCE TOPS NHRA QUALIFYING \nBrittany Force broke both of her career marks Saturday with a 3.725-second pass at 331.53 mph to take the No. 1 spot in Top Fuel qualifying in the NHRA Keystone Nationals in Mohnton, Pa. \nNHRA officials canceled the second session of qualifying Saturday because of persistent rain at Maple Grove Raceway. Qualifying also was washed out Friday in the third event in the six-race Countdown playoffs.
