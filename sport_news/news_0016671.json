That's all they care about.\"\nGale's lawyers played the call while Diggins was testifying. Diggins said he did not know he was being recorded.\nThe apology came via an e-mailed statement where Diggins said he regretted the comments and supported the department's ongoing reform.\n\"My comments were inappropriate as a leader of this department,\" the statement said. \" I have apologized to Mayor (Michael) Hancock, Executive Director (Stephanie) O'Malley, and now, I want to apologize to our community. The Denver Sheriff Department is on a solid path toward meaningful improvement, and I remain committed to this course of action.\"\nNoelle Phillips: 303-954-1661, nphillips@denverpost.com or @Noelle_Phillips\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T12:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:23:37.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
