(AP Photo/Matt Dunham) \nJose Mourinho was sent off during another Premier League defeat for his Chelsea on Saturday, before London rival Arsenal won to provisionally move to the top of the table. \nThe volatile Portuguese manager was red-carded at halftime of Chelsea’s 2-1 loss at West Ham that left the titleholders in 15th place and 12 points adrift of Arsenal after it beat Everton 2-1. \nElsewhere, Real Madrid struggled to beat Celta Vigo 3-1 in a matchup of the top two teams in Spain, while Bayern Munich got its 1,000th Bundesliga victory as both powerhouses provisionally extended their leads. \nHere is a look at Europe’s major leagues on Saturday: \n___ \nENGLAND \nMourinho had to watch from the stands as Andy Carroll nodded in a late winner to give West Ham the win over 10-man Chelsea, handing the defending champions a fifth loss of the Premier League season. \nMourinho was sent to the stands at halftime, apparently incensed over refereeing decisions that saw a goal by Cesc Fabregas disallowed and Nemanja Matic sent off for two yellow cards. \nCarroll took full advantage as the substitute striker leapt above the Chelsea defense to head Aaron Cresswell’s pinpoint cross past goalkeeper Asmir Begovic in the 79th minute. That extended West Ham’s best-ever start to a Premier League season, having now beaten Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea. \nChelsea, in contrast, is down in 15th place, 11 points behind provisional leader Arsenal. \nArsenal’s Olivier Giroud and Laurent Koscielny scored in the 36th and 38th minutes for Arsenal, before Ross Barkley’s deflected strike before halftime for Everton. \nAlso, Aston Villa lost 2-1 defeat at home to Swansea, Leicester beat Crystal Palace 1-0, Norwich lost 1-0 at home to West Brom and Watford won 2-0 at Stoke. \n___ \nSPAIN \nCristiano Ronaldo scored his 12th goal in as many games to help Real Madrid to a deceptively tough victory at second-place Celta Vigo. \nRonaldo and Danilo gave Madrid a two-goal lead at Balaidos Stadium by the 23rd, but Madrid needed goalkeeper Keylor Navas to protect the advantage before Celta lost Gustavo Cabral to a second yellow card in the 57th. \nDespite playing a man down, Manuel “Nolito” Agudo got a deserved goal for the hosts in the 85th and Celta almost leveled before Marcelo scored Madrid’s last goal just before the final whistle. \nMadrid rose three points clear of both the Galician club and defending champion Barcelona, which hosts Eibar on Sunday. \nElsewhere, Kevin Gameiro netted a hat trick in Sevilla’s 5-0 rout of Getafe, Malaga defeated Deportivo La Coruna 2-0, and Granada drew 1-1 with Real Betis \n___ \nGERMANY \nArjen Robben scored on his return from injury as Bayern Munich defeated visiting Cologne 4-0 for the club’s history-making win. \nRobben, who hadn’t played since picking up a groin injury on international duty on Sept. 3, broke the deadlock in the 35th. \nArturo Vidal made it 2-0 five minutes later, Lewandowski claimed his 13th of the season in the 62nd with a header off Douglas Costa’s free kick, and Thomas Mueller completed the scoring with a penalty in the 77th. \nBayern moved provisionally 10 points clear of Borussia Dortmund after extending its league record start to 10 wins from 10 games. \nAlso, Admir Mehmedi scored in the 89th minute for Bayer Leverkusen to overturn a two-goal deficit and beat Stuttgart 4-3, Wolfsburg defeated Darmstadt 1-0, Eintracht Frankfurt came from behind to win 2-1 at Hannover and Werder Bremen won 3-1 at Mainz. \n___ \nITALY \nInter Milan was held to a 1-1 draw at Palermo in a match that saw the visitors reduced to 10 men as they failed to move provisionally two points clear atop Serie A. \nIvan Perisic broke the deadlock on the hour mark but Inter’s lead lasted just six minutes before Alberto Gilardino leveled. \nInter defender Jeison Murillo was sent off 10 minutes from time following a second yellow card but the visitors still managed to force Palermo goalkeeper Stefano Sorrentino into more crucial saves. \nInter moved level on points with leader Fiorentina, which hosts third-placed Roma Sunday. \nAlso, Empoli beat Genoa 2-0, while Bologna fought back to win 2-1 at fellow promoted side Carpi and move off the bottom of the table. \n___ \nFRANCE \nStruggling Ajaccio stunned Nice 3-1 as the Corsican side secured its first win ever in the French topflight. \nSixth-place Nice is level on points with Rennes, which held 10-man Lorient to a 1-1 draw with the help of goal-line technology. \nSecond place Angers drew 0-0 with Guingamp to move within four points of leader Paris Saint-Germain while Montpellier beat Bastia 2-0.
