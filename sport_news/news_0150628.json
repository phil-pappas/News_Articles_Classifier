Jeremy Smith was assigned to the Iowa Wild of the AHL on Tuesday. \nOther than that, one of the bigger surprises on the list is forward Tyler Randell, who worked his way into the Bruins' bottom-six conversation with a good training camp. \nRandell, 24, had 11 goals and nine assists last year for the Providence Bruins, his fourth year with Providence. He also showed his willingness to fight in the preseason, dropping the gloves three times in four games, and fought 14 times in the AHL last year. \nWith Chara's status in question, the Bruins have seven other defensemen on the roster, as well as 14 forwards and two goaltenders. \nIf Chara does return to the lineup, Colin Miller could be the odd man out on defense. You can see the full roster in the gallery above.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T22:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:07:15.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
