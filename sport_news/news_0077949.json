The victor picked up $10,000 of the $46,000 purse.\nEarly leader Shane Cockrum held on to second, with Chris Windom in one of Rochester's Fred Gormly cars, and Shane Cottle third and fourth. Local dirt hotshot Stewart Friesen charged from 14th in a second Gormly entry to wind up fifth.\nKody Swanson celebrates after winning the Silver Crown 78 at the New York State Fairgrounds in Geddes, N.Y., Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015. Scott Schild | sschild@syracuse.com Scott Schild | sschild@syracuse.com Filling out the top 10 were A.J. Fike, Jerry Coons Jr., pole sitter Justin Grant, C.J. Leary and Austin Nemire.\nChampionship dirt cars' long and successful history on the NYS Fairgrounds mile race track began on Sept. 18, 1905.\nFor years, the same open-wheel champ cars that ran the Indianapolis 500 switched to dirt tires and competed in 100-milers at Syracuse during fair week.\nEleven different Indy 500 winners also won 100-mile races at Syracuse. Included in this group are drivers Al Unser Sr., Roger Ward, Johnnie Parsons and Bob Sweikert.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T12:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:31:28.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
