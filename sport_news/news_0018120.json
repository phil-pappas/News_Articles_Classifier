It marked the first time since 2004 the Seahawks blew a 17-point lead in the second half.\nThe clincher came when Cincinnati kicker Mike Nugent's 42-yard field goal banged off the upright and in with 3:36 left in overtime.\nIt was as demoralizing a regular season loss as the Seahawks have endured since Pete Carroll took over in 2010. In his post-game press conference, Carroll said he was \"baffled\" after his defense allowed 204 yards of offense in the fourth quarter, while the offense labored when it needed to run clock, picking up just three first downs on their final six drives.\nCarroll shouldered the blame after the second fourth quarter collapse in five games.\n\"We got to figure out schematically how to run things right at the end of the game,\" Carroll said. \"It's all about outlasting them and doing things right longer and for some reason that didn't happen.\"\nSo the Seahawks are 2-3 and set to face an undefeated Carolina Panthers (4-0) team coming off a bye next Sunday at CenturyLink Field.\nHere's what we learned about this team from Sunday's loss:", "external_links": ["http://player.performgroup.com/eplayer.js#713906ff738546a8d2ceb52ae8.x6rthd808kkn1foa60q1fgdzt.s"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:43:53.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
