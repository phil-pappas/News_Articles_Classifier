(For OzarksSportsZone.com) -- Despite jumping out to an early 2-0 lead, the Morrisville softball team saw its season come to an end on Thursday in the semi-final game of the Missouri Class 2 District 6 tournament as Morrisville fell to El Dorado Springs, 3-2. Morrisville (18-6) got a two-run triple from Breanna Presley in the first inning, but after that struggled to get anything going offensively. El Dorado Springs head coach Jarrod Mays said he was proud of the way his girls handled the adversity.“I’m proud of these girls for battling all night long,” Mays said. “We could have let those first two runs in the first inning get to us, but we put it out of the way and played our game.” CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS OF THE GAME The Lady Bulldogs from El Dorado Springs did not panic though. After getting runners on second and third in the second inning, shortstop Cameron McPeak delivered a perfect squeeze bunt to get the Bulldogs on the board. After hitting a rough patch in the first inning, El Dorado Springs’ pitcher Tailor Hutsell struck out five out of the next six batters that she faced. The Bulldogs’ junior catcher Anyssa Salazar gave her pitcher high praise after the game.“She (Tailor) is a big part of our team,” Salazar said. “We wouldn’t be here without her, and she does amazing things every time she steps on the mound.” Hutsell finished the game with eight strikeouts while going seven innings strong. Salazar led the fifth inning off with a double to the wall where she went 4-for-4 in the contest. Paige Esry delivered a one-out RBI double to score Salazar from third. Salazar said her perfect night at the plate was a big confidence boost for her.“It was huge for me to have a big game tonight,” Salazar said. “I had been in a slump lately, and I couldn’t let my team down because they count on me to come through in big time games.” The pitching duel between El Dorado Spring’s Tailor Hutsell and Morrisville’s Cassidy Elliott went all night long until the seventh inning. The Lady Bulldogs got another double from Anyssa Salazar to lead off the seventh. Then El Dorado’s Paton Babecock dropped a fly ball in between the second baseman and the center fielder with two outs to score Salazar from third base which eventually would go on to be the game winning run.
