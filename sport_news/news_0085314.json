Visitors can also get vision screenings, product samples and health insurance information. \nImmunizations will be administered by Walmart's more than 10,000 licensed pharmacists. \nHealth screenings take about 10 minutes to administer. \nWalmart expects that at least 3,000 people tested during the four-hour event will be undiagnosed diabetics and more than 7,000 will learn they suffer from high blood pressure. \nThe fair runs from noon to 4 p.m. Saturday. \nCopyright 2015 by ClickOnDetroit.com.
