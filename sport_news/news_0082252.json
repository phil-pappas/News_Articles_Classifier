(AP) - \nUnder Armor will replace Adidas as the University of Wisconsin-Madison's exclusive athletic uniform and equipment supplier for the next decade under a multi-million contract that the UW System's Board of Regents approved Friday. Related Content Police look for man who attacked 15-year-old Iowa fan \nThe deal calls for Under Armour to supply $3.3 million in shoes, apparel and equipment to UW-Madison's 23 athletic teams for free in the first year. The school will get $2.5 million worth of free gear in year two. The amount of free gear will increase incrementally to $3 million by year 10. \nThe company also will pay UW-Madison $4 million annually; $450,000 in annual licensing royalties; up to $500,000 to rebrand the school's athletic facilities; and $150,000 to create Under Armour retail space in the school's clothing stores. \nUnder Armour also agreed to hire at least two UW-Madison students every year as interns at its Baltimore headquarters and will own the exclusive right to sell all replica uniforms and products. UW-Madison will get access to company archives and inspection reports for all its facilities that produce goods for the school. \nThe regents approved the contract with a unanimous voice vote and no discussion. \nAdidas has been UW-Madison's gear supplier since 2001. The school sued that company in 2012, alleging it must pay Indonesian workers up to nearly $2 million still owed for back wages and benefits to honor a code of conduct provision in its contract. The lawsuit was settled short of trial in 2013. \nThe school's contract with Adidas ends in June 2016. \nUW-Madison Athletic Director Barry Alvarez was expected to discuss the Under Armour contract during an afternoon news conference at Camp Randall Stadium. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
