Heâs also wise enough not to plan too much else.\nIn Dec. 2011, Jablonski, then a 16-year-old high school sophomore from Minnesota, was paralyzed from the chest down after he took a hit from behind during a hockey game. His spinal cord was severed at the neck.\nJablonskiâs injury, survival and recovery became a national story, as athletes from several professional sports showed their support for the teenager and invited him to attend practices and games.\nThe injury ended Jablonskiâs dream of playing in the NHL, but now heâs working in the league. The Kings have hired Jablonski, now a USC student, as a communications intern. He will work in the press box this season, providing assistance to reporters and Kings staffers.\nâI definitely wanted to keep pursuing a career in hockey and that hockey lifestyle,â Jablonski said, âand Iâm super interested in PR and communications so I hoped I could find an area that was a good fit.ââ\nJablonski has already had an impact on hockey. His injury raised awareness about safety in youth games and the need to eliminate dangerous, blindside hits.\nHis mobility now limited to a motorized wheelchair, Jablonski isnât focused on his limits. He has already spent two-plus years hosting a weekly hockey-talk radio show in Minnesota, and in January, Jablonski accepted a scholarship to attend USC and study journalism and communications.\nKelly Cheeseman, the Kingsâ chief operating officer, graduated from the same high school as Jablonski. After a job interview, Jablonski became part of the Kingsâ college-intern staff this month.\nâHaving had the opportunity to work in radio the last couple years, thatâs been a blast,â Jablonski said. âThatâs definitely an interest and passion of mine, but Iâve been looking into anything in sports media. I donât know where I want to go and what I want to do exactly, but thatâs what this time is for, and Iâm looking forward to figuring it out.â\nJablonski hopes to walk one day, and pushes for spinal-cord research. Family members and friends helped organize and run Jablonskiâs âBEL13VE Foundation,â which raises money to support survivors of spinal-cord injuries and to promote further research.\nJablonski said he is enjoying life in Southern California and, even though heâs now a Kings staffer, heâs looking forward to next weekâs visit from his favorite team, the Minnesota Wild.\nâThis is the first time Iâve started hockey season (with the temperature) in the 90s,â Jablonski joked.\nSHAKE IT UP\nAfter losses in their first two games, and only one goal in each game, the Kings made changes to each of their top three forward lines in practice Saturday.\nDustin Brown moved up from the third line to the first line, with Anze Kopitar and Marian Gaborik. Milan Lucic dropped to the second line with Jeff Carter and Tyler Toffoli, while Tanner Pearson dropped from the second line to the third line with Nick Shore and Trevor Lewis.\nSutter made changes throughout the Kingsâ loss to Arizona on Friday and made more in practice, even though the Kings generated 41 shots on goal against the Coyotes.\nâWe thought we played a lot better (in the second game), but we need results,â Sutter said. âYou need the result. Thatâs a bad habit to get into, saying that you played well (in losses). That becomes an out clause. You donât want to do that.â\nContact the writer: rhammond@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:34:30.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
