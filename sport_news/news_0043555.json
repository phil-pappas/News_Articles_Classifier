There’s no question about that. Depending on who you ask, he’s also one of the greatest divas. And now that diva reputation has stretched all the way back to his Australian high school.\nAdChoices As noted by The Guardian, Kyrgios’ former high school Radford College, in Canberra, took down the tennis star’s framed portrait due to his perennial “bad behavior” on the court and in the interview room.\nHere’s Radford College principal Fiona Godfrey on the school’s decision to at least temporarily censor one of their most famous alums.\n“He’s had a temporary departure from the hall [of fame], he’s actually on detention in the director of sport’s office at the moment and we’re keeping him there until his behaviour improves – which we’re very confident that will happen given that he was a Radford student,” Radford principal Fiona Godfrey told Fairfax Media.\n“I was speaking to the director of sport who said he can remember him vividly. He was a lovely bloke at school and he also vividly remembers him playing a large tennis competition involving staff and funnily enough he won it.\n“He only has to string together a few good tournaments and we’ll be happy to put him back up there.\n“All good sportspeople are an influence and particularly being from Canberra the kids all follow him quite closely and we want them to have good role models,” she said.\nThe decision is a bold one, and could serve as a model for other schools worldwide that feel the need to at least temporarily clip the wings of a favorite son or daughter, and make a stand about the behavior they feel is appropriate in the process.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/21/nick-kyrgios-on-detention-after-being-removed-from-his-schools-hall-of-fame?CMP=soc_567"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:44:14.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
