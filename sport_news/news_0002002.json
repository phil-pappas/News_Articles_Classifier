The Vikings entered the day 2-8 over their last 10 total road contests. \n-- The Vikings won the time-of-possession battle by a decisive margin: 36:27 to 23:33. Minnesota, the least-penalized team in the league entering the day, also committed just three penalties for 31 yards to continue its theme of playing disciplined football. \n-- Minnesota's Kyle Rudolph was targeted just twice in Detroit, ending with a pair of catches for 10 yards. He did reel in a 1-yard, second-quarter TD grab, though. Rudolph, who turns 26 on Nov. 9, already ranks third in Vikings history for receiving TDs by a tight end (20 TDs), trailing only Steve Jordan (28) and Visanthe Shiancoe (24). \n-- Rookie tight end MyCole Pruitt notched his first career reception in impressive fashion. With 2:33 left in the third quarter, the Southern Illinois product -- whom the Vikings drafted in the fifth round last spring -- registered a 13-yard catch-and-run on a third-and-12 play. It was Pruitt's only catch of the day, but a memorable one. WHAT IT MEANT \nWith the win, the Vikings are now 4-2 and are two games over .500 for the first time since 2012. They have three seemingly winnable games between now and mid-November -- at Chicago, versus St. Louis and at Oakland -- before the schedule stiffens considerably. In other words: Minnesota can't afford to rest on its laurels after this road win. PLAYER OF THE GAME \nWhile Bridgewater smoothly dealt the ball out to 11 different receivers on Sunday, Diggs seemed to truly spark the Vikings' offense. With a game-high 108 receiving yards, the 21-year-old rookie outperformed superstar Calvin Johnson (five receptions, 86 yards, one score) on \"Megatron's\" home turf -- no small feat. DON'T FORGET ABOUT ME \nThe Vikings' defense had no shortage of playmakers in this road duel, as stalwarts like Harrison Smith (game-high nine total tackles, one sack) and Everson Griffen (1.5 sacks) continued to star. But rookie linebacker Eric Kendricks made the biggest impact among Minnesota's defenders, producing six solo tackles, two sacks and three tackles for loss, along with three total QB hits. Kendricks' best play on Sunday was a sack with 12:31 remaining in which Stafford wasn't even given enough time to complete his drop-back in the pocket. THAT MOMENT \nDiggs' 36-yard TD grab inspired the most oohs and ahhs during Sunday's game, but Adrian Peterson's lengthy run at the 8:01 mark of the third quarter was the game's biggest play. Peterson, who had been bottled up to that point, uncorked a 75-yard run down the right sideline for his longest jaunt of the season. That set up a short field goal that gave the Vikings a decisive, 25-17 lead. Peterson ended with 98 yards on 19 carries. THIS NUMBER \n1 for 12. That was Detroit's combined conversion rate on third- and fourth-down attempts on Sunday. Stafford often had pressure in his face in those key situations, which halted multiple Lions drives. THEY SAID IT \n\"Usually, I just try to run under it. I was just trying to lay out for (the 36-yard TD reception).\" -- Diggs, via the Associated Press \n\"Everyone told us that this team couldn't win a road divisional game, so this was big for us.\" -- Zimmer, via the AP \n\"Our prayers and condolences go out to Flip Saunders' family. . . . It's really a tough day in the Twin Cities, with losing a guy like that.\" -- Zimmer, regarding the death of Timberwolves boss Saunders WHAT'S NEXT \nMinnesota visits division rival Chicago next Sunday at noon. The Bears , who were idle in Week 7, are 2-4 this season, including an 0-2 mark against NFC North opponents. \nFollow Kelly Beaton on Twitter 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:30:24.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
