If approved, the project would open in March 2018.\nInnovative Housing plans to develop a six-story building featuring 10 one-bedroom units, 15 two-bedroom units and 15 three-bedroom units. The project would add much needed housing for extremely poor families, with the two- and three-bedroom units reserved for people earning no more than 30 percent of the area median income.\nThe one-bedroom units would be affordable for individuals earning up to 60 percent of median income, said Kurt Creager, director of the Portland Housing Bureau.\n\"Innovative Housing inspires a lot of confidence,\" said Creager, who came away impressed from the company's work redeveloping the Erickson Fritz Apartments in Old Town.\nThe Pearl District project could also be as large as 50 units and eight stories, or 64 units and nine stories, depending on how much public money is contributed by the city.\nHousing officials expect to kick in between $2.6 million and $8.2 million for the project, at Northwest 14 th Avenue and Raleigh Street, depending on its size.\nOfficials also will contribute the quarter-acre site, which the city bought for $1.3 million this year from Hoyt Street Properties .\nPortland leaders forced Hoyt Street to sell its property under terms of a 1999 development agreement to redevelop 34 acres in the Pearl District.\nHoyt Street pledged that 35 percent of all new units on its property would be affordable to people earning up to 80 percent of the median. But the company fell short.\nOut of 2,556 units built or under construction, just 727 – or 28 percent – met income targets.\nHoyt Street would have needed to develop 258 affordable units to catch up.\n-- Brad Schmidt\nbschmidt@oregonian.com\n503-294-7628\n@cityhallwatch", "external_links": ["http://www.innovativehousinginc.com/housing/erickson_fritz.html"], "published": "2015-10-14T16:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:03:49.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
