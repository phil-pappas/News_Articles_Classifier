Unioto was followed by Zane Trace (66), Westfall (75), Piketon (89), Huntington (103), Paint Valley (167) and Adena (196). \nThere was also a familiar individual top place finish for the girls as Unioto’s Haley Wright cruised to yet another win for the Shermans with a time of 18:19. \nAdena’s Taylor Clarkson cracked the top five, coming in second at 19:30. However, the remaining three spots in the top five belonged to Shermans — Alex Evans (18:43), Elena Knipp (18:53) and Tessa Sylvester (18:59). \nRounding out the top ten individual finishes was Westfall’s Mackinley Trapp (19:20), Zane Trace’s Ivy Beam (19:23), Unioto’s Abbey Mohan (19:36), Zane Trace’s Alison Chinn (20:06) and Zane Trace’s Mckenzie Ray (20:29). \nTeam wise, Unioto had no troubles winning the meet with 21 total points. The Shermans’ average time of 18:54 – 1:34:30 total – was the fastest average time ever ran, on the girls side, under coach Matt Paxton. \nFollowing Unioto in team finishers was Zane Trace (52), Westfall (74), Adena (123), Huntington (136), Paint Valley (156) and Southeastern (186). \nAll SVC teams will now look towards next Saturday’s district events. The Southeast district cross country meets will be held held at Rio Grande University. \nWaverly sweeps Southern Ohio Conference Meet \nAlso coming through with a dominant performance was the Waverly Tigers’ boys and girls cross country teams. \nOn the boys side, the Tigers won the meet with 29 points. They were followed by Minford (70), Green (86), South Webster (100), Eastern (105), Wheelersburg (121), Notre Dame (185) and Northwest (191). \nIndividually, junior Hunter Hoover won a conference title as well with a mark of 16:50. Also placing in the top ten for Waverly was Alec Parker (fifth, 17:52), Brenden Reed (sixth, 18:00), Trevor Penrod (eighth, 18:45) and Brody Sibole (ninth, 18:55). \nThe Tigers’ girls also won their event with a total of 23 points, followed by South Webster (48) and Minford (63). \nIndividually, Jamie Welch was the SOC champion with a time of 20:02. Also placing in the top ten for Waverly was Hannah Goodman (fourth, 21:40), Leta Heigley (sixth, 21:59), Gabby Towler (seventh, 22:20) and Kiara Smith (ninth, 23:20). 4 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1ROXCG1 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:07:09.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
