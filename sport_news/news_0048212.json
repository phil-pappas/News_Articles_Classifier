Vasha Hunt/vhunt@al.com ORG XMIT: ALBIN401 (VASHA HUNT) Comments \nA 5-yard pass from Chad Kelly to Quincy Adeboyejo advanced the ball to Alabama's 1-yard line. \nOne more yard and Ole Miss had a touchdown and early momentum in the nationally televised matchup between the then-No. 15 Rebels and the No. 2 Tide Sept. 19. \nIt wasn't that easy. \nRunning back Jordan Wilkins was stuffed for no gain on a run up the middle on second down. Ole Miss again failed to score on third down, as a carry by 295-pound defensive lineman Robert Nkemdiche was stopped at the line of scrimmage. The Rebels finally scored on fourth down on a run to the outside. \nAlabama's next opponent, Georgia, is off to a 4-0 start largely behind one of the best running games in the country. \nWith multiple high-level running backs and a physical offensive lineman, the Bulldogs have run for 258 yards per game and are fourth nationally in yards per carry (6.87). Alabama, however, may be as equipped as any team in the country to neutralize that running game. \nIt's truly a matchup of strength vs. strength — running backs Nick Chubb and Sony Michel combined with the Bulldogs' offensive line against a Tide defensive front led by inside linebacker Reggie Ragland and defensive linemen A'Shawn Robinson and Jarran Reed that is arguably the best nationally against the run. Alabama Beat Reporter Show, Sept. 30, 2015 Alabama beat reporters Matt Zenitz and John Talty pick the players Alabama needs to be concerned with beyond the obvious (running back Nick Chubb) Wednesday. \n\"The whole goal in running the football — up front anyway — is to get movement, get guys moved back or get guys moved sideways or something, but get them off the spot, get them out of their gap,\" Georgia coach Mark Richt said. \"But these guys are very big and strong and physical, and they're good fundamentally. It's hard to move them. It's hard to get them where you can create a little space for the backs, and that's what everybody's having trouble with. ... It will be a great challenge for our team.\" \nRELATED: Alabama-Georgia game could be largely determined by production of 2 players \nAlabama is fourth nationally in rush defense, allowing just 56.75 yards per game. The Tide are third in yards per carry allowed (1.97). \nWisconsin is traditionally one of the top running teams in the country. The Badgers' 320 rushing yards per game was fourth-best nationally last year. Even after losing star running back Melvin Gordon and three starting offensive lineman from last season's team, Wisconsin has rushed for 713 yards and nine touchdowns while averaging 5.3 yards per carry in three games since falling to Alabama in both team's season opener Sept. 5. \nAgainst the Tide? The Badgers ran the ball 17 times, not including sacks and a late end-around against Alabama's second-team defense. Those 17 carries produced 39 yards. \nWisconsin starting running back Corey Clement — who has missed the last three games due to injury — was limited to 16 yards on eight carries. \nOnly three Badgers runs went for gains of longer than three yards. \nOle Miss is the only other Power Five conference team the Tide have faced. \nThe Rebels had gains of 18 and 10 on runs to the outside. Ole Miss only picked up 64 yards on its other 30 carries. \nRELATED: Why Alabama-Georgia game will be extra special for several Tide players \nThe Rebels ran five times needing two yards or less to either pick up a first down or score a touchdown. The fourth down scoring run to the outside was the only successful attempt. \nLeading by six and with less than a minute left in the fourth quarter, Ole Miss had a fourth-and-1 at Alabama's 31-yard line. A first down would have sealed the Rebels' win. Instead, Ragland and Reed teamed to stop 300-pound wildcat quarterback Jeremy Liggins for no gain on a run up the middle. \nThat gave the Tide's offense a final chance for a game-winning touchdown, though it failed to capitalize. \nGeorgia comes \"right at you,\" Tide defensive lineman Dalvin Tomlinson said. The Bulldogs, he said, \"really don't try to hide stuff. They are \"just coming at you and try to knock your head off.\" \nAlabama is built to stop those exact types of offenses, though Georgia will be — probably by far — the Tide's biggest test yet. \nChubb and Michel ran for a combined 455 yards and four touchdowns while averaging 7.6 yards per carry in lopsided wins over Vanderbilt and South Carolina.

We don't like all the elusiveness. We prefer being physical throughout the whole game.\" \nLimiting the production of Chubb and Michel would make the Bulldogs more dependent on quarterback Greyson Lambert, who is still relatively unproven despite being a combined 33 of 35 with five touchdowns and no interceptions in Georgia's last two games — wins over South Carolina and Southern. \nThe Virginia transfer threw 11 interceptions with just 10 touchdowns as a sophomore with the Cavaliers last season. He was a modest 11 of 21 for 116 yards with no touchdowns and no interceptions during the Bulldogs' 31-14 win over Vanderbilt Sept. 12. \nBeing forced to rely heavily on the passing game will be even less desirable if the weather forecast proves accurate. \nWeather.com is calling for heavy rain Saturday in Athens. There is a 100 percent chance of rain, according to the website. \nDoes that play into Alabama's favor? \n\"We feel like this [game] comes down to playing regular football — getting the call, looking at your tendencies, lining up correctly and just striking blockers,\" Tide senior outside linebacker Denzel Devall said. \"You have to be up for the challenge, and we're up for it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:27:06.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
