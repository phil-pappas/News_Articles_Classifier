Courtesy photo The Scottsdale newspaper published a team photo of the Scottsdale Community College volleyball team, which won the NJCAA national championship in 1981. 1981 NJCAA Division II National Volleyball Champions Sue Ellering Brian M. Bergner Jr. The Daily Courier SCOTTSDALE - Being part of a special team can be hard to explain to those who haven't had the experience. A bond is formed between teammates, and that bond can stay true for many years after playing together.Players graduate and move on with their lives. They get jobs. They start a career. They get married. They start a family. They raise their children, and much, much more.Although time passes quickly, it surely isn't without thoughts of, \"I wonder what some of my old teammates are up to these days?\"Well, for Prescott High School volleyball head coach Shellie Bowman, she got her chance to have that question answered and then some.In 1981, Bowman was a setter for the Scottsdale Community College volleyball team. The Artichokes went on to win the NJCAA national championship that year, the school's first.Now, 34 years later, Bowman and her teammates received word they were being inducted into the Scottsdale athletic hall of fame for their achievement.That ceremony was earlier this month, and it's something Bowman said she will never forget.\"As they were calling us on stage we were stopping and hugging, and crying,\" Bowman said about the ceremony at Scottsdale Community College.It's been 30-plus years since some of her teammates have seen one another, she said, so it was an \"emotional\" night to say the least.\"That was one of the coolest things about being inducted together is that we kind of met, and we hadn't talked (in so long), then we just picked up where we left off,\" Bowman said. \"Nothing was awkward and we just had a blast. Celebrating with them was the neatest part.\"Bowman said most of her teammates were \"shocked\" they were being selected as the school's first team into the hall of fame.\"That's a really awesome way to be recognized,\" Bowman said, adding that the 1981 season is a time in her life she has never forgotten.\"It was just one of those teams where we got along really, really well. We did a lot of things on and off the court together. We probably weren't the most physically (gifted) team ... we were basically underdogs,\" Bowman said. \"So, when we started doing really well, and ended up knocking off Mesa, which hadn't been beat in 10 years, or something like that, then it started getting real and it was like, 'Hey, we're pretty good, this is working.'\"And when the team went to nationals, everything fell into place.\"It was said at the induction that Ted Compoc, our coach then, he had went to the athletic director and said, 'If you hire me, within two years I will get you a national championship team.' And within a year and a half, he had one,\" Bowman recalled.Not just one, but two, as it turns out. The Artichokes would win another national title the following season.Terry Pazos said Bowman was a \"great teammate\" back in those days because \"she was just always there for anyone.\"\"She was very supportive. Always had a smile on her face, if you needed a friend, she was there,\" Pazos said. And on the court, she was just as competitive as anyone out there.\"But you couldn't tell if she was mad or anything, she was calm, she was competitive. You couldn't tell if she was upset (or happy),\" Pazos said, adding that they both attended the University of South Carolina together after their Scottsdale days had come to a close. They were both recruited to play volleyball for the Gamecocks.\"(It was my) first time away from home. Shellie had been living away from home already, and it was good to have her there, someone I could depend on,\" Pazos said. \"She was my roommate in South Carolina. It was a good deal for us and South Carolina was getting their program started. We had success there. It was fun to know someone.\"Pazos and Bowman have stayed in touch throughout the years, usually getting together at least half-a-dozen times every year.\"We were there for each other's kids being born,\" Pazos said.Another teammate, Stacie Tidwell, who was the team captain for that 1981 national championship team, said Bowman was always a \"true team player with a positive, intense and winning attitude.\"\"I think the key to our championship was that we all got along really well and we were friends on and off the court,\" Tidwell said. \"Reuniting with [Bowman] after many years was like nothing had changed. I am fortunate to have had her as a teammate and to still be able to call her my friend.\"Playing volleyball wasn't the only sport Bowman had the chance to make an impact on her teammates, however, as the 1981 Corona del Sol graduate led the Aztecs to a state basketball title her senior year.And now as she leads a Badgers volleyball squad that is ranked No. 7 in Division II, it's easy to see some of the things she learned back in her playing days have carried over to her newly found role as coach.\"I learned that you can have tons of talent, but if you're not really a team, you're not going to take it to that level,\" said Bowman, who is in her fourth year as head coach of the Badgers. \"You can win and be successful, but you really have to have each other's back and love being together because you're with each other a lot. So, I think that's why we were so successful.\" Follow Brian M.
