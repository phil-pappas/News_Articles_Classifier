Reid expects to again get the nod tonight and should again get plenty of help from teammates. INDIANS 35, TIGERS 14. \nNewnan Cougars (5-2, 3-1 in Region 3- ) at Pebblebrook Falcons (3-4, 1-3): The way the schedule works out, Newnan has a chance to clinch a playoff berth tonight having played two of the three remaining leaders in 3- . That should be enough motivation for not looking ahead to next week’s showdown at Drake Stadium with East Coweta. Look for another strong first quarter from Newnan after outscoring its last three opponents 49-0. COUGARS 31, FALCONS 13. \nLoganville Christian (7-0, 4-0 in GISA Region 1-AAA) at Trinity Christian (6-2, 4-0): A region champion in 1-AAA could be crowned as early as tonight with a win by Loganville, which managed to rally past Heritage two weeks ago. It will be Trinity’s toughest challenge by far among a five-game win streak that included a 475-yard rushing effort in last week’s win. Trinity would love a Lion’s share of at least a tie for the 1-AAA title tonight, but Loganville may just have too many weapons to keep tabs on. Expect this one to also go down to the closing minutes. THEIR LIONS 13, OUR LIONS 10. \nHeritage School Hawks (4-4, 3-1 in GISA Region 1-AAA) at Dominion Christian Knights (1-6, 1-3 in 1-AAA): The Hawks have had rotten luck at Dominion Christian in the past and will have to bear down tonight against another wide-open Knights passing attack that has put up 82 points in its past two games. Numbers and ball-control expect to be firmly on Heritage’s side. If the Hawks can avoid turnovers and stay focused, a win should set up a matchup for at least second place in the region next week at home against Trinity. HAWKS 42, KNIGHTS 14. \nCentral Christian Crusaders (8-0, 3-0) at Hancock Academy Rebels: The Crusaders step out of West Region play tonight while getting ready for next week’s showdown with CrossPointe Academy to decide first place. With an extra day of rest following a punishing win over rival Ballard Christian, expect Central to be ready. CRUSADERS 61, REBELS 20.
