To prevent such an abrupt ending in 2016, \"we've just got to win the division.\"\nThe 6-foot-8 Betances felt that his mechanics were off during his final 17 games. In that 19-inning stretch he had 29 strikeouts but gave up 16 hits, 14 walks and four home runs.\nOver his first 57 appearances, covering 65 innings, Betances yielded 29 hits, 26 walks and two homers with 102 strikeouts.\nOn Friday, manager Joe Girardi vigorously defended his use of the bullpen down the stretch, particularly Betances.\n\"Does anyone know how many pitches he threw this year compared to last year? I would bet not,\" Girardi said. \"Does anyone know that he was shut down about the last 10 days of September last year?\"\nBetances (6-4, 1.50 ERA, nine saves) pitched 84 innings compared to 90 innings last season (5-0, 1.40 ERA, one save).\n\"He threw five more pitches in the regular season this year than last year,\" Girardi said. \"I was cognizant of his workload.\"\nGirardi said he consulted a card that listed all of his relievers' workload statistics. In Betances' case, the card went back to his last season at Class AAA. \nThe bullpen was impacted in September when Adam Warren was added to the rotation after Nathan Eovaldi (elbow) was injured and Ivan Nova proved ineffective. Girardi called Warren \"as valuable as pitcher as we had all year.\"\nIn analyzing Betances' finish, Girardi said, \"I really just think he had a really human month.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:37:21.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
