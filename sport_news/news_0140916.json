He practiced all week. I would expect him to play unless he doesn't feel good,\" Dykes said. \"We'll warm him up and see how he feels. He's felt good all week.\" \nLasco, who rushed for 1,115 yards last season, injured his hip Sept. 12 against San Diego State, after running for 128 yards. \nDefensive end DeVante Wilson (foot) and safety Griffin Piatt (knee) also are expected to play. Offensive tackle Brian Farley (ankle) is questionable. For more on Cal sports, see the Bear Talk blog at ibabuzz.com/beartalk . Follow Jeff Faraudo on Twitter at twitter.com/Jeff Faraudo.
