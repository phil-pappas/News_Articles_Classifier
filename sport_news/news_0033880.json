I guess I tickled him. I wouldn't mean to. That's kind of weird.\" Brent Drinkut/AP The alleged incident occurred on October 2 and Moore was suspended on October 6. \nAfter the awkward play, the player at center — who had shoved Moore to the ground earlier in the practice — moved to a position on the defense. He later approached Moore to embrace him. \n\"He acted like he was giving me a hug and he kneed me in my crotch,\" Moore told the paper. \n\"He said that he did that because I spat on his shoe, even though he was five feet in front of me.\" \nA few days later, Moore was pulled out of class and sent to the office of the assistant principal, Jim Miller — who asked about the alleged tickle during practice. \n\"I'm like, 'I guess,'\" Moore recalled. \n\"He was laughing when I touched him. I didn't mean to say tickle. I said tickle because he laughed.\" \nMoore's mother was called and he was suspended with a note from Miller that read: \"Student inappropriately touched another student during football practice.\" \nMoore's mother Tamara Moore plans to appeal the suspension.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T20:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:04:06.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
