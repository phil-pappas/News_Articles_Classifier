After a light rain shower hit Leon halfway through the second quarter, the contest became sloppy and a bit of a slogfest. Snaps were high. Players couldn’t hang onto the ball well. The teams combined for at least a dozen fumbles, and the game was scoreless through the first 44 minutes and 25 seconds. Then the game got crazy. Douglass scored a touchdown, but missed the 2-pointer. Bluestem followed suit to tie the game 6-6. Douglass scored again. Bluestem started to make a comeback drive, but the Bulldogs’ defense and a wet football combined to slow down Bluestem, and Douglass held on for a 14-6 win. “Our kids have been battling adversity this week and have not had the season they wanted to have,” Douglass coach Kelley Sayahnejad said. “Any time you’re doing that, it’s just a struggle to get going early...credit to them to just keep playing and keep grinding and finding a way.” Through the first half, neither team got closer to the opposing goal than when Moran burst loose for a 39-yard carry to reach Douglass’ 23 on the game’s first play from scrimmage. The Douglass defense pushed back the Lions to stop the drive. The Bulldogs finished with 62 rushing yards on 21 carries while Bluestem had 51 yards on 14 attempts for the half. Both teams traded punts and turnovers on down through the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter with the game still scoreless. In the fourth, Douglass finally started churning out some big runs, including plays of 11, seven and 12 yards to set up a 28-yard touchdown run by Zac Dressler. Moran wasn’t going to go down without a fight, though. Moran took the first carry on the Lions’ next possession 38 yards to get to theDouglass 22. Two plays later, Moran scored his own 21-yard touchdown to tie the game 6-6. Back game the Bulldogs. Dashon Arnold took a sweep to the right for 18 yards.On the next play, Arnold came in motion and looked like he might get the carry again the other direction, but Kye Wright kept the direct snap and burst up the middle for a 53-yard touchdown. Douglass converted the 2-pointer try to take a 14-6 lead. “That’s what happens when you start blocking the right player,”Sayahnejad said. “Lane Moran is such a great player at the middle linebacker spot for Bluestem. If you don’t block him, you’ve got no chance. We finally some movement up front and got in his face.” Page 2 of 2 - TheLions had one last chance. They took over at the 27 yard line. Weston Scott got a seven yarder, then a 13 yarder. A couple plays later, the Lions pulled some trickery with a halfback pass as Moran took a sweep right and pulled up, then threw downfield to Jacob Lanier, who hauled in a tough catch for 25 yards to get to Douglass’ 23. With the clock being an issue, though, the Lions had to hurry. They ran a couple plays to reach the 9 yard line. But on the next two plays, snaps were high, led to fumbles, and theLions were unable to finish off the drive. The win gives Douglass a 1-1 District record, though a tough game against Collegiate looms with a playoff spot on the line. Bluestem is now 0-2 in Districts and play Independent next week. “Anytime you’re 1-6, any win is a great win, no matter when it is,” Sayahnejad said.
