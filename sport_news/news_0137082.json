Rocky Mountain (4-3, 2-3 Front Range League) snapped a two-game losing streak by beating Poudre last week. \nFriday at 7 p.m. Rocky Mountain hosts winless Mountain Range (0-7, 0-5 FRL) in the penultimate game of the regular season. \nWhy it matters: Rocky Mountain sits 17th in the first edition of wild card points, used to select the 32-team Class 5A playoff field. \nThe Lobos have a chance to host a first-round playoff game, but need to win Friday against Mountain Range and next week at Monarch to keep that hope alive. \nTo win, Mountain Range must: Force turnovers. It’s really the only way Mountain Range could pull off the upset. The Mustangs won’t be able to completely stop the rushing monster of Rocky Mountain. \nThe Lobos average 229 yards per game and 5.5 per carry. It’s not likely the Mustangs can stop Cade Hairgrove (135 yards per game) and Autry Baskin (62 per game), but forcing multiple turnovers could make the chance for an upset. \nTo win, Rocky Mountain must: Start fast. Mountain Range’s closest loss was 12 points and the Mustangs haven’t scored more than 14 points in a game all season. \nRocky Mountain needs to put the hammer down right away and not give Mountain Range any hope for an upset. If the Lobos can score a couple touchdowns early, they will win. \nFollow sports reporter Kevin Lytle at twitter.com/Kevin_Lytle and at facebook.com/KevinSLytle. \nLocal Week 8 weekend schedule \nFriday: Mountain Range at Rocky Mountain, 7 p.m. Twitter updates: @Kevin_Lytle .
