Tweet \n‘The Savage’ puts up his British and Commonwealth welterweight belts against nemesis Dale Evans at the Barclaycard Arena in Birmingham. \nThe champion’s first defence of the British crown will come at the top of the bill, live on Sky Sports, with the world watching, writes Craig Birch. \nAnd Eggington, who turned the tender age of 22 on Thursday, thinks drawing the game Evans into a war would be a gift. \nOne step towards the Lonsdale belt and silencing Evans - one of only two to hand him a pro defeat with both losses coming in Prizefighter - would be well worth celebrating. \nHe quipped: “The party will go on until the Saturday after if I get the win! We’ve training for a southpaw, but it’s not a massive problem. \n“I won my titles against short, stocky and game opponents and that’s what I can expect from Evans. However, a late notice opponent could be a bit of a banana skin. \n“I’m in the main event and the plan is to put on a performance, show that I deserve to be a champion and prove I’m levels above when we boxed last time. \n“If he wants a brawl, I’m confident I’ll come out on top. I’m more than up for that.” Sam Eggington (left) and Dale Evans go head-to-head at today's weigh in. Picture by Lawrence Lustig. \nThe absent left hander is Brummie Frankie Gavin, who pulled out with a foot injury. Eggington “had a feeling” it was going to happen. \nIn came Evans at 10 days notice, who was considering quitting the sport. Freely admitting boxing was leaving him skint, he was never going to turn down a huge opportunity and a payday. \nThe fearless Welshman won’t just roll over, either, and has put through hell by coach Gary Lockett since to get him fit enough to have a good go. \nHe said: “We’ve just hammered everything at 100mph and I’ve done everything that Gary has asked me to do. \n“I feel ready for the 12 rounds and I was training for a keep-busy fight up soon, anyway, so I was already in the gym. \n“I’ve beaten Sam before, but you can’t compare a three-round bout to a British title fight. He’s put some decent opponents away in style and I’ve got a lot of respect for him. \n“But I haven’t come here just to be a late step in, I want to take those belts home.” \nChief support could be a David versus Goliath task for Rowley Regis’ Jason Welborn, who goes up against three-time world title challenger Matthew Macklin. Jason Welborn (right) and Matthew Macklin go head-to-head at today's weigh in. Picture by Lawrence Lustig. \nMidlands champion Welborn will be Brummie Macklin’s first fight in the light middleweight division for nearly 10 years, with the veteran dropping down at age 33. \n‘Mack the Knife’ has proved a puncher up at middleweight while Welborn, 29, has campaigned for most of his career at welterweight. \nThe two will clash for the vacant WBC International belt, with Welborn saying: “I respect where he’s been, every boxer does. \n“But, when we get into the ring, all of that will be shut out. He’s just another opponent. I’m here to test him and I want to stay at this level.” \nMacklin has vowed to retire if he were to suffer a shock defeat, adding: “It’s the last roll of the dice. I wouldn’t even have to look at myself if I lost to Jason - it would be over.” \nStafford’s Rob Hunt puts up the Midlands welterweight title for the first time elsewhere on the show, with Brummie Karl Wiggins getting his shot. \nHunt pits his wits against an adversary six years his senior, but the 29-year-old has nearly four times more pro experience. \nOldbury-based Brummie Craig Cunningham has been left high and dry, as his wait to defend the Midlands middleweight crown continues. \nCunningham won the strap 10 months ago with Halesowen’s Lennox Clarke, who was ruled out through flu, due to be his first challenger. \nThe solid southpaw remains on the card, though, as he keeps busy and his spirits up with a six-rounder against the never-stopped Yorkshireman Adam Jones. \nAnd it’s double trouble for Bloxwich’s Daniel Breeze, who steps through the ropes for the first time since learning he will become a father for the first time, to twins! \nThe unbeaten teenage welterweight, 19, must put that one side against the experienced and capable Chris Jenkinson, who has eight wins on his pro record.
