Roundy said he and his team removed bone fragments and a blood clot that had formed.\n\"She tolerated the procedure very well,\" Roundy said during a news conference Thursday. \"We then placed a drain to relieve some of that intercranial pressure buildup.\"\n Oregon school shooting victim shot 5 times making 'incredible' recovery doctors say Julie Woodworth, 19, was shot 5 times, including the most serious wound to her head, last week at Umpqua Community College. Her doctors say her recovery so far is remarkable, but she has a long, uncertain road to travel in the future.\nFor the past week, doctors and nurses continued trying to keep the pressure low, limiting any additional damage to Woodworth's brain. Her family â€” including her mother, father and brother -- have been at her side since that terrible Thursday morning last week.\n\"We're happy to say the pressures are on their way down and she's out of the woods as far as the major swelling,\" Roundy said. Another good sign, Roundy said, was the removal of the breathing tube Wednesday: \"She is breathing on her own.\"\nRoundy also said Woodworth recently opened her eyes spontaneously and is able to look around the room and track movements.\n\"She does not yet interact with people on a verbal basis,\" Roundy said.\"She's not talking yet. A lot of these things can take some time.\"\nIndeed, Roundy explained, he and her caregivers do not know to what degree she will recover her ability to walk, talk or interact with others, \"but we are very happy with the progress she has made thus far, and we're pretty excited about that.\"\n\"She has really made an incredible recovery,\" Roundy continued. \"She's been very strong, and she's fought very hard.\"\nFor one of her best friends, the news that Woodworth is fighting hard to survive is no surprise.\n\"Jules is such an amazing person,'' Annasha Rosas, her friend of two years and a former co-worker from Sutherlin, said in an Facebook messenger exchange. Rosas said Woodworth started at the Roseburg Walmart shortly after Rosas did and \"changed the work environment. Not just for myself and her, but for other co-workers and all of the customers.\"\nThe two often got together to drink coffee, talk about their boyfriends and jewelry, and do make-overs, Rosas said. She added that she was confident her friend would recover.\n\"Julesy will be 115% better by the time she's recovered,\" Rosas said. \"She's a fighter.\"\n-- Stuart Tomlinson\nstomlinson@oregonian.com\n503-221-8313\n@ORweather\nA GoFundMe account has been established in Julie Woodworth's name to help defray medical costs.
