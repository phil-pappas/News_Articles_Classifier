West Milford will come to town with a 1-3 record, having lost three straight since an opening day win against Paterson Kennedy. \nThe Hornets have enjoyed success against the Highlanders, winning the past three games in the annual series and eight of the last 11, dating back to 2004. The Homecoming festivities should add a boost to Saturday afternoon. Some nice activities are planned and with good weather, it should be a lot of fun. Last year's Homecoming game was hampered by a cold, raining day. \nI spoke with Passaic Valley's girls' tennis coach Tony Ottino the other day. The Hornets are struggling so far this fall, but Ottino is making some adjustments to the lineup and hopes October will provide the team some momentum. \nIt was a quiet week for the boys' soccer team, which played at Union City last Friday night and lost a 1-0 decision. Head coach Mike Couden's team has a busy week. The 6-2 Hornets faced Paterson Kennedy and Passaic County Tech earlier this week. On Saturday, Passaic Valley, the top seed, will host Wayne Hills in the quarterfinals of the Passaic County Tournament, starting at 9:30 a.m., which will be a nice start for Homecoming Weekend. The Patriots and Hornets will then play a regular season, Big North game on Tuesday, Oct. 13 at 4 p.m., also in Little Falls. \nThe PV girls' soccer team was eliminated from the county tournament last weekend. Head coach Kathleen Berthold's team played Passaic earlier this week and will visit powerful Wayne Hills next Tuesday at 4 p.m. On Oct. 14, Passaic County Tech comes to Little Falls for a 4 p.m. kickoff. \nOn to field hockey, coach Lori Demsey's team will be home to Dwight Englewood this Thursday, Oct. 8 at 4 p.m. and on Oct. 13, the Hornets visit Hackensack, also at 4 p.m. \nThe gymnastics team will visit Randolph High School for a 4:30 p.m. match on Friday, Oct. 9. The Hornets, coached by Jenai Agosta, will host Clifton and Pascack Valley on Oct. 14 at 4:30 p.m. in the Farrell Gymnasium. The county championships are set for Oct. 21 at West Milford. \nAnother young team, the girls' volleyball squad will host Passaic County Tech this Thursday at 4 p.m. On Friday, it's off to Wayne Hills and on Oct. 13, the Hornets are back home to take on Fair Lawn. Both of those matches begin at 4 p.m. Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:52:16.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
