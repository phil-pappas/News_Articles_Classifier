He added another touchdown on a 2-yard run on the first play after returning an interception 53 yards in the fourth quarter. \nGreen was part of an active defense that also featured junior back Ray Bentley, who had two interceptions, and junior tackle Jamere Furbush, who was a disruptive force along the line of scrimmage. \n\"This was really big,\" Green said. \"We all played strong together out there.
