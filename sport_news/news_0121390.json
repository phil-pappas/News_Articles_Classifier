The soccer pitch behind Ionia High School was partly shadowed with the silhouette of trees before the Bulldogs final home game of the 2015 season. Senior Night was underway and as the names were announced of those that will graduate in May of 2016, each player walked down centerline of the pitch, between two rows of people holding balloons. One name stuck out from the rest. Well, more like one person. You can put the name and the person together and you’ll immediately know who he is. Ionia senior Avery Baylis, who is missing his arm from the elbow down, walked toward his team, with both of his parents, Aaron and Sara right by his side before his last regular season home game. The 17-year old senior, who’s been trying to get the nickname, ‘One-Arm Wonder’ to stick, has lived in Ionia his entire life, which is where his story first began. When his mother Sara was five months into her pregnancy, both her and Aaron found out in an ultrasound that Avery was missing his arm below the elbow. “That was probably the hardest time for us, because we went through his entire life and what we thought it would be,” said Aaron. “You think about all the challenges that he’s going to have to face. (Sara and I) went and had coffee, we sat and talked about it, prayed about it and we were fine with it.” In kindergarten, Avery went to school for the first time. Sitting in a circle, the teacher began to notice something was going on. “(The kids) were looking at Avery and pulling their arms up into their sleeves,” said Sara. “They were trying to see what it was like to have one arm.” Sara said the teacher was so impressed with the kids, because they weren’t making fun of him, but they wanted to see what it was like. As Avery got older, having one arm became his identity. “When I’m walking around school or walking around anywhere, a lot more people recognize me than I recognize them just because of my arm. They remember my name and I have trouble remembering their’s,” said Avery, laughing. A three-sport athlete, Avery excels in soccer and football and is going to be back playing basketball in his senior year. He first realized he enjoyed soccer around the age of 9, playing AYSO in front of the high school he would eventually attend. In football, he started his sophomore year at the convincing of a friend, as the extra point kicker and kickoff kicker. He began playing basketball in the 6th grade, and hasn’t stopped since. Page 2 of 4 - “Growing up with it, it was just like growing up with two hands…I think,” said Avery, laughing. “Everything came naturally, just like you with two hands, you had to learn with two hands, I had to learn how to do everything with one.” He does get a lot of looks, where-ever he goes, and admits, it does get on his nerves once in awhile. “I’ve definitely had a lot of stories that I’ve come up with,” said Avery. “The craziest one was a shark attack.” His friends too make fun of him once awhile, but when it comes to being serious, he’s never been made fun of. On the field or on the court, Avery says he doesn’t really see others play ‘softer’ against him, but it happens once in awhile. “They do go easy on me, until I show them that they don’t need to,” said Avery, with a smile. His best game in soccer this year was against Eaton Rapids, a 1-0 win, in which the lone goal scored was his. In football, it was against Owosso this year, where he was a perfect 7-for-7 in extra point attempts and two touchbacks. In basketball, it was a game in 8th grade against Bath, sinking five, three-pointers in row in the first half. And no, he doesn’t use a prosthetic arm. Not when he’s in school, not when he’s playing sports, even basketball. “I tried it when I was younger and I don’t like not having feeling in this,” said Avery, pointing to the tip of his left arm. As a child, Avery did what every other kid would do when learning new things. He would take an object and touch it to his left arm or ‘stub’ as he would call it. “He couldn’t feel with it, it just flopped around,” said Sara. “We figured, when he got older, he could make that choice, if he needed the assistance. He never needed it, doesn’t want it.” Aaron said both he and Sara thought he might want it in high school, for cosmetic reasons. “His arm became is identity as much as anything,” said Aaron. “When he was a sophomore, he went to prom and he had a bow-tie for his arm and for his neck. He had a lot of fun with that.” Now as a senior, Avery has just one football game left with Ionia eliminated from the playoffs and possibly just one more soccer game left with districts next week. Basketball will start up soon and that’ll be it. Page 3 of 4 - The sports-loving senior will continue soccer in the summer, playing for the Midwest United FC out of Grand Rapids and then in Spring Arbor next fall, currently as a verbal commit for soccer. “He’s got a tremendous skill set, he’s got a good strong body and powerful leg,” said Ionia soccer head coach Ryan Nevins. “He can distribute the ball when he sees the opportunities.” It’s funny Nevins mentioned the powerful leg, because that’s Avery’s favorite thing about both soccer and football. “I love just kicking the ball, just kicking it hard,” said Avery. “My grandpa made a wall out of apple crates, because he owns an apple orchard. He just stacked up a huge wall of crates and I just kick as hard as I can against it. I love the sound, the feeling.” For basketball, he loves watching the ball go through the net every time. “He’s been pretty consistent with extra points,” said Ionia football head coach Mike Holes. “Kickoffs is where he has a real strong leg. He can put that ball down inside the 10-yard line which is great for kick coverage.” Holes also had him in his weightlifting class, where he said Avery has squat 225-pounds for reps. “He’s an everyday normal kid like everybody else. He goes about his life, not looking at any type of hinderance from being born with one arm.” They’ve also considered him as a punter, but though he would have trouble catching the ball with one arm. He still gave it a shot in practice to see how he would do. “He’s got a great heart. Anything that we ever ask him to do, he never thinks about it, if he has one arm or two,” said Holes. “He’s a good tackler too, he’s had to make a couple of tackles on kickoff.” If Avery ever had to give some advice to someone who may be going through something similar, he had nothing but positive thoughts. “You can do anything. You just have to set your mind to it and work at it and you can accomplish anything.” Sara then chimed in. “We’ve always said to him, with God, all things are possible.” As Avery walked past his teammates, giving each player, ‘a nub-five’ as he raised his left arm up and the rest of his team put theirs up. It was a sign of strength, trust and community. Soon after the announcements were done, the team huddled up at midfield for their final pre-game chant in the regular season. It was one final meeting, one final time to win and one more time to play on the pitch, for Ionia’s One-Armed Wonder. Page 4 of 4 - Follow Sports Editor Chris Zadorozny on Twitter @ZadsISS.
