NEXT Welcome to Wopular \nWopular is an online newspaper rack , giving you a summary view of the top headlines from the top news sites. Senh Duong (Founder) San Francisco Chronicle , Thursday - 10/01/2015 - 08:05 PM \nBraves president of baseball operations John Hart announced the move. Jessica Mendoza will become the first female analyst to call a postseason game when she works the American League wild-card matchup next week for ESPN. Mendoza had replaced Curt Schilling on the network’s top MLB announcing team for the rest of the regular season after the former pitcher was suspended last month in the wake of an anti-Muslim tweet. San Francisco Chronicle , Thursday - 10/01/2015 - 08:05 PM \nLate in the first quarter Sunday, Arizona wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald lined up the right slot against 49ers outside linebacker Aaron Lynch, who gave him a bump at the line of scrimmage before passing him off to … nobody. The play highlighted both the 49ers’ early-season pass-coverage issues and Bowman’s visible frustration as they have surrendered 676 passing yards en route to losing the past two games by a score of 90-25. [] three plays after Fitzgerald’s all-alone reception, Bowman again threw his hands to the heavens after Fitzgerald hauled in a 17-yard catch between inside linebacker Michael Wilhoite and cornerback Kenneth Acker. Fitzgerald had, again, lined up in the slot against an outside linebacker (Ahmad Brooks) and had roamed free after an initial bump. In the second quarter, Bowman raised his hands when tackle Tony Jerod-Eddie jumped offside and, along with the rest of the defense, he subsequently stopped for a few seconds as running back Chris Johnson embarked on an easy 15-yard scamper. The ultra-competitive linebacker’s frustration is understandable in the midst of a 40-point loss. After a 43-18 loss at Pittsburgh in Week 2 in which the 49ers surrendered six completions of at least 28 yards, Bowman was asked how he played: I made the plays that I could. On Thursday, defensive coordinator Eric Mangini was asked about Bowman’s frustration. Bowman, who has yet to speak with the media this week, is one of nine team captains and one of four defensive starters with more than 34 career starts. Wide receiver Anquan Boldin, another team captain, had animated conversations with quarterback Colin Kaepernick and head coach Jim Tomsula in the first half.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T09:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:05:39.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
