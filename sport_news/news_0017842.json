JOSEPH 185 \nAt Pontoosuc Lake Country Club in Pittsfield, St. Joseph took the course needing two wins to qualify for the Western Massachusetts Division III tournament. Monument Mountain had other ideas. \nSt. Joe's Cody Tynan was medalist with a 5-over-par 40, but the Crusaders couldn't overcome the Spartans. \n\"Our top three were great. We needed one more score today,\" said St. Joe coach Fran Brilliant. \"The back of [Monument]s rotation was pretty strong. It wasn't our day.\" \nTynan beat Monument's Dylan Buffoni by one shot. ——— ST. JOSEPH (185) — Andy Cella 43, Brent Arseneau 58, Cody Tynan 40, Jacob Felix 62, Mike Gingras 44, Jett Werhan 60.

VINCENT 3, MCLA 2 \nIn North Adams, the MCLA men's soccer team fell in heartbreaking fashion to Mt. St. Vincent on Monday, losing 3-2 on a goal that was scored with under a minute remaining in regulation. \nThe Trailblazers (2-7-2) had to battle out of a 2-0 hole to even get to that point. Mt. St. Vincent scored 1:14 into the game on a Joseph Llamuca goal, then Kevin Jardines put the Dolphins up 2-0 in the 18th minute. \nBefore the half was out, though, Anthony Basile scored a header on a pass from Tyler Vona and Dylan Pereira, and Christopher Valente tied things up off of a Sakan Sadowsky cross. \nIn goal for MCLA, Kamron Anderson stopped six shots in the loss.
