Returning home with momentum this week after another impressive road win to remain unbeaten in league play, the Hope Bobcats will face more tough tasks on Friday night hosting the Watson Chapel Wildcats at Hammons Stadium. These two ball teams have had very close and intense games in previous seasons. The Wildcats have came out on top each time, but this year's Bobcats are more experienced, forceful and a determined team on mission for achievement. At the beginning of the season, the Bobcats have set a goal to end their streak of losses to Watson Chapel. A big overall performance from the offense and defense will be needed for victory against this Wildcat squad. Head coach Jay Turley knows this game means a lot to the Bobcats season if reclaiming the 5A South Conference title for 2015. Turley feels his Cats are pumped, focused and ready to compete this Friday against Watson Chapel. “They're 2-0 in conference and predicted to win the conference. They're a really good football team and have played some really tough competition. They're dangerous with a lot of speed and make big plays. They're always scary” said Turley. “Their secondary is really good and fast. We've got to run great routes and throw the ball well. This puts pressure on us to do things right. If we throw and catch well, we'll be ok.” The Bobcats continued their consistency of being productive on the gridiron last week. The Cats' offense racked up 240 yards of offense with another big game from quarterback Austin Stubber to complete 224 yards passing for four touchdowns. Senior receivers of the trio Andrew Washington, Cory Briggs, Trey Lawson all had touchdowns and Kadarius Munn caught key receptions against Hot Springs. Turley knows the offense will need to be as efficient and effective as been in their last four games. But, the defensive unit of the Bobcats continues to keep blossoming to be a solid force this season. The strong senior leadership of the defense is keeping their unit effective as a team. They racked up 122 tackles against a tough and powerhouse Hot Springs offense last week. The Bobcat defense came into this season as one of the toughest and strongest units in the conference. They'll need another big game this Friday to stop Watson Chapel as Hope's defense has held three of their five opponents scoreless in the second half this season. The Wildcats are picked first in the conference, finished second tied last year with a 5-6 overall record. Coach Jared Dutton is back to head over their football program and they're expected to be multiple offensively and 4-3 defensively. The Wildcats are strong defensively with speed and strength. They hold a conference title in their program the 2010 season. The Wildcats lost to Greenbrier last season in the first round of the class 5A state playoffs. They've defeated the Bobcats the last two seasons and return with a host of All-state, All-Conference players for this year. Page 2 of 2 - Turley knows the Wildcats have a good football program over the years and they're not a team his Bobcats can't play catch-up too in the early going of this battle. “We're up against another good football team and can't play catch-up. We've got to come out defensively with intensity like we have done. We did that against Hot Springs last week and it took them a long time to score. Our defense must come out hard, fast and ready to play,” said Turley. The Bobcats are healthy and ready to go for this week. As been since the beginning of the season, the Bobcat fans have helped their team with intensity at home and on the road. Turley expects the atmosphere to be filled with high energy and excitement as the Cats return home to provide the home town crowd another epic battle on the Bank of the Ozarks Field at Hammons Stadium. Turley said, he hopes everyone comes out Friday night to pack stands at Hammons Stadium and root on their home town Bobcats to see two undefeated teams in the conference battle. Once again, the Cats are predicted to lose this week against Watson Chapel, but proved the odds wrong last week defeating Hot Springs on the road. The Cats were predicted to lose to the Trojans by three points, but Hope held ground on the road and handed Hot Springs a 25-14 loss. Thus far, the Bobcats have scored the most points allowed by a Hot Springs Trojans team this season. The Cats hope to overcome a prediction again this week to remain unbeaten in conference in their quest to the conference title hardware for 2015. Kickoff is set at 7 p.m. at Hammons Stadium. 5A South Conference Glance Hope – 4-1 overall, 2-0 conf. Watson Chapel – 2-3 overall, 2-0 conf. Lakeside – 4-1 overall, 2-0 conf.
