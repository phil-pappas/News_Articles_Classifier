My initial lease was set to end last fall, but now it looks like I'll be finished with this place in 2018 or later. So we've got lots of time to get to know each other!”\nBertha – the tunnel boring machine drilling the new State Route 99 beneath Seattle – was supposed to complete its work years ago.\nBut yesterday, WSDOT and Seattle Tunnel Partners announced that Bertha’s re-start would be delayed for another month. It’s been idle for close to two years now.\nThere's a chance I might be moving on December 23, though it's unlikely,” the ad continues, suggesting that this might not be Bertha’s last delay.\n“In the meantime, it would be great to split the rent (it's pretty steep! The price that's listed is actually an estimated cost per day for every day that I don't move) with someone. Plus, I'd really like the company. Though people come and go pretty often, it can get lonely, and I'm not exactly well-liked.”\nthe poster ends with some basic stats.\n“About me: I'm white, 7,000 tons, and about 57.5 feet tall. I've been in Seattle for over two years, and so far I like it. I don't get out much, but I'm actually a pretty fun gal; just ask the elected politicians who fought so hard to get me to come here!”\ncomment (1)", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-23T22:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:41:20.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
