Going into today's game, he needed only 83 yards to reach that plateau.\nSo to start the second half, the Tigers quarterback gave Fournette the ball. He plowed his way up through a gap in the Gamecock defense as if Moses parted the Red Sea for him. No one from South Carolina could even think about stopping dude as he went for an impressive 87-yard run, which you can see here:\nLeonard Fournette: reaches 1,000 rush yards in 5th game; is 10th player in FBS history to rush for 1,000 yards in season’s first 5 games\n— ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) October 10, 2015 1003 yards in just five games.
