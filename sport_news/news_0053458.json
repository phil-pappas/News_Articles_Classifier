He consistently won the ball in the middle of the field and sparked dangerous attacks before eventually leaving the game late in the second half after being banged up on a tackle. \nHalloran also converted a penalty kick, after Takacs’ header off a corner kick drew a handball, with 25:20 remaining in the first half. \nWhat it means : The Stateliners advance to a county semifinals date at Newton on Oct. 24. Newton, the second seed, defeated Hunterdon Central in penalty kicks on Saturday. \nPhillipsburg continues its quest for its second county title in program history after the disappointment of falling to North Hunterdon in last year’s championship game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:55:47.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
