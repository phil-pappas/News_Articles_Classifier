No. 1 Ohio State easily keeps the top spot. The Buckeyes had one of their more impressive start-to-finish outings of the 2015 campaign against Penn State and claim 45 first-place votes. Baylor, with 12 firsts, checks in at No. 2 after rolling past West Virginia. \nNo. 3 TCU, a winner at Iowa State, gets four firsts this week. TOP 25: Amway Coaches Poll \nMichigan State remains fourth but has no firsts after its unusual escape from Michigan. No. 5 LSU and No. 7 Utah continue to claim a No.-1 vote each, with Clemson holding steady at No. 6. Alabama handed to Texas A&M its first loss of the season and edges ahead of Florida State for the No. 8 spot. Notre Dame regains a foothold in the top 10 following its home win against Southern California. \nStock up: Memphis. The Tigersâ€™ triumph against Ole Miss had a ripple effect that throughout the American Athletic Conference. Memphis climbs five positions into a tie for 17th with Michigan, but two more undefeated AAC squads also enter the top 25. Houston has been knocking on the door for several weeks and finally breaks in at No. 22, and No. 24 Temple is ranked for the first time since USA TODAY began administering the coaches poll in 1991. Snap judgments from Week 7 of college football \nStock down: Mississippi. On the down side of the Memphis win, the Rebels take an 11-spot plunge to No. 23. \nStock up: Iowa. The Hawkeyes continue to climb the ladder, checking in this week four places higher at No. 13 following a convincing romp past Northwestern. \nStock down: Texas A&M. The Aggies are hardly the first team to take a hit in the rankings after an encounter with the Crimson Tide. In this case, the fall is six slots to No. 16. Follow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. \nStock up: Toledo. The Rockets are also living up to their nickname as they shoot up five positions to No. 20. \nStock down: Florida. A road loss at night at LSU with a backup quarterback is certainly forgivable, but the Gators still take a bit of a hit as they drop three spots to No. 14. \nNew kids on the block: No. 22 Houston, No. 24 Temple, No. 25 Georgia. \nCollege dropouts: UCLA, Boise State, Northwestern. \nGALLERY: AMWAY COACHES POLL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:31:15.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
