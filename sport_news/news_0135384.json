So that has created problems,\" said Salkeld.\nHowever, it is clear that China has embraced the sport, and when that happens, things can move quickly -- and in unexpected directions.\nYi Guoqing, tournament director and general manager of the Wuhan Sports Development Institute, said it took just two years from the start of negotiations for the Wuhan Open to become reality.\nHe compared tennis in China to the market reforms under Deng Xiaoping, dubbed \"socialism with Chinese characteristics\" which allowed it to flourish into the world's number two economy.\n\"The government means making the policies, the hand of the market is the participation of the society,\" said Yi.\n\"Not only (in) tennis,\" he added. \"The whole economy of China is taking the same road. It is changing and I believe it will be more open in the future.\"\nAnd this may allow the country to create an entirely new model of tennis -- one with Chinese characteristics.
