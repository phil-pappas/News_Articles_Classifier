He was convicted in a Carolina court of domestic violence in July 2014. His conviction was appealed and Hardy spent the bulk of the 2014 season on the NFL exempt list while his legal issues were being resolved. The charges were eventually dropped last February when the victim refused to cooperate with the district attorney's office after receiving a financial settlement from Hardy.\nThe Carolina Panthers said good-bye to their Pro Bowl pass rusher at that point and even though he faced an NFL suspension, the Cowboys signed Hardy to a one-year contract. That suspension came down from the NFL office in April -- 10 games -- but it was appealed over the summer and reduced to four games.\nHardy returned to Valley Ranch this week and met with the press Tuesday for the first time as a Cowboy. There was no contrition, no remorse, no humility and no sensitivity to the actions that cost him a football season and potentially his career. He was flippant and made inappropriate comments about guns and Tom Brady's wife.\nThis guy just doesn't get it. Talk about anything you want -- anything, that is, except women and guns, the two factors that got him into trouble in the first place. Cowboys coach Jason Garrett allegedly admonished Hardy for his comments -- then Jones went on the radio Friday morning and defended Hardy and his words.\n\"Here's the deal,\" Jones said on 105.3 The Fan's G-Bag Nation on KRLD-FM (105.3), \"unless he looks like he's contrite, unless he looks like he's absolutely whipped, and really obviously sorry for the situation, he's going to get criticized.\"\nNot only did Jones serve as an enabler for Hardy, he undercut the message of his head coach. Garrett calls the player out -- then the team owner calls him back in.\n\"We want to define ourselves by what we do, not what we say,\" Garrett said.\nUnfortunately, the words of Hardy and Jones were spoken louder this week than any actions. The less spoken by all parties going forward, the better.\nListen to Rick Gosselin at 10:50 a.m. Tuesdays on Sportsradio 1310 AM/96.7 FM The Ticket with Norm Hitzges and Donovan Lewis, and follow @RickGosselinDMN on Twitter.\nGreg Hardy: Should you root for him?\nCowlishaw: If you expected contrition from Hardy, you haven't been paying attention\n10 things you might not know about new Cowboy Greg Hardy\nNational reaction to Hardy comments about Brady's wife, coming out 'guns blazing': Hasn't learned; 'worst possible metaphor'\nStaubach's daughter says Hardy 'can't be made a hero'; Cowboys need to hold him accountable\nColumnist blasts Cowboy: Ray Rice apologizes, shunned; Greg Hardy doesn't, welcomed\nLatest news/updates\nRookie Lucky Whitehead set to make debut | LB Sean Lee will play | QB Matt Cassel to be active\nThe impact of Greg Hardy, Rolando McClain on Cowboys: 'Good to have some SOBs'\nBill Belichick goes into great detail about how he learned the Tom Landry shift\nA look at one big reason why Cowboys haven't been able to recreate winning formula of '14\nNext up: Patriots\nCowboys gameday: How Dallas matches up with New England, expert picks, keys to a victory and more\nOur experts' Week 5 NFL picks: Anybody got the Cowboys vs. the Patriots?\n10 things Cowboys fans should know about the Patriots, including how Tom Brady spends his bye week\nPodcast: NFL writer gives his Cowboys-Pats pick, says Cowboys should start Cassel, erred in not retaining Murray\nPeter King explains what the Cowboys need to do to beat the Patriots\nExpert analysis\nSherrington: The time to find out how well Matt Cassel knows the offense is getting close\nGosselin's NFL rankings: Why Giants, Redskins, Raiders are better than Cowboys\nCowlishaw: Why fans shouldn't expect Cowboys' O-line to match 2014 performance\nGosselin: Sorry, Cowboys fans, Patriots are the best NFL dynasty of all time\nFun stuff\nCowboys fans tell us what Tony Romo is thinking in Top 25 fan-made memes\nCowboys car replete with white leather, blue suede, 24-inch rims an ode to America's Team\nThe 20 funniest memes from Cowboys-Saints, including more DeMarco Murray trash talk\nMiss Carolyn Price flashes star-studded fingernails, rallies Cowboys fans for game vs. Patriots\n ", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/dallas-cowboys/cowboysheadlines/2015/10/08/cowlishaw-expected-contrition-hardy-paying-attention", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/dallas-cowboys/cowboys/2015/10/07/national-columnist-hypocrites-ray-rice-apologizes-shunned-greg-hardy-welcomed", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/dallas-cowboys/cowboys/2015/10/09/jerry-jones-explains-expected-greg-hardy-criticized-speaking-media-first-time-since-joining-cowboys", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/dallas-cowboys/cowboysheadlines/2015/10/08/staubachs-daughter-says-hardy-made-hero-cowboys-need-hold-accountable", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/dallas-cowboys/cowboysheadlines/2015/10/07/podcast-nfl-writer-gives-cowboys-pats-pick-says-cowboys-start-cassel-erred-retaining-murray", "https://twitter.com/RickGosselinDMN"], "published": "2015-10-09T21:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:48:45.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
