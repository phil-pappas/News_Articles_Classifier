The Warriors, under fifth-year head coach Ryan Meek, are ranked 24th with a 15-6 record overall and a 9-0 mark in the Southern Athletic Association. \n“It’s great that the team is recognized for their hard work,” said Meek. “They have done a great job continuing to fight. Our long term goal is to win the SAA and make it to the NCAA Tournament again.” Hendrix ended the 2014 season receiving votes for the first time after a trip to the second round of the NCAA Tournament. \nThis season, the Warriors have received votes in every poll and finally cracked the Top 25 on Tuesday. \nHendrix has played a tough schedule this season with a win over No. 11 Carthage (then #4) and losses to No. 1 Washington (Mo.), No. 12 Wisconsin-Whitewater, No. 16 Elmhurst and No. 20 UT Dallas. \nThe Warriors will host Rhodes College in SAA play at Grove Gymnasium in a Dig Pink match at 6 p.m. Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:19:17.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
