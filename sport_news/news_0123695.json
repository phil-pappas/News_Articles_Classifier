Kelly Lyell/The Coloradoan Kelly Lyell , kellylyell@coloradoan.com 11:01 p.m. MDT October 10, 2015 Redshirt freshman Coleman Key took over early at quarterback for CSU’s football team in Saturday night’s loss to Boise State, only to be replaced late in the game by starter Nick Stevens.

The Rams managed just 5 yards on their first offensive series and had just two on the second, a sack for an 11-yard loss and a fumble by running back Dalyn Dawkins. \nKey came into the game on the third series and didn’t get much going immediately, either. But on the fourth series, he led the Rams on a 16-play, 75-yard scoring drive. His 13-yard touchdown pass to Joe Hansley cut the Boise State lead to 17-7. \n“I felt like I provided a spark early, but I’ve just got to be more consistent,” said Key, who completed just 5 of 19 passes for 56 yards, and threw two interceptions. \nStevens had better passing numbers, completing 8 of 10 passes for 60 yards with no touchdowns or interceptions. But he was sacked three times, and was on the sidelines watching Key run the offense on both CSU scoring drives. \n“I think the biggest thing that me and Coleman have got to realize is we’re on the same team, and we’ve just got to root for each other while we’re in there,” Stevens said. “I wasn’t kind of complaining about it on the sideline. I was hoping for him to do well.” \nHIGGINS IS HUMAN: All-American CSU receiver Rashard Higgins had his string of three consecutive 100-yard receiving games snapped but still led the Rams with three catches for 42 yards. \nHiggins had 10 100-yard receiving games a year ago while earning consensus All-American honors and leading the nation in receiving yards (1,750) and touchdown receptions (17) — both school records — while making a school-record 96 catches. \nPASSING RECEIVER: CSU receiver Joe Hansley improved to 2 for 2 in his career as a passer, taking a lateral from Key and throwing a 34-yard pass to tight end Kivon Cartwright to set up a field goal late in the first half. \nHansley’s only previous career passing attempt also was a 34-yarder to Cartwright on a fake field goal in a Sept. 28, 2013, win at UTEP. Hansley was lined up as the holder on the field goal try, a role he still holds. \nMORE TURNOVERS: CSU came into the game ranked among the bottom 10 teams in the nation in turnover margin at minus-9, and turned the ball over three times on two interceptions and a fumble against the Broncos. The Rams had just one takeaway, on an interception early in the second half by safety Nick Januska. \nFollow reporter Kelly Lyell at twitter.com/KellyLyell and facebook.com/KellyLyell.news. 1 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://noconow.co/1LoMhLP TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:58:29.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
