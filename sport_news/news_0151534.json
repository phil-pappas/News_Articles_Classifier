Buy this photo CHRIS PEDOTA/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Pitcher Matt Harvey heads to the locker room at the end of practice on Wednesday, Oct. 7, 2015. \nHarvey was fined for the incident, and Collins said Harvey was apologetic Wednesday. \n“We all were [annoyed],” Collins said. “It’s over. Done. New day. We took care of it.” \nPhotos: Mets' workout at Citi Field \nHe added: “We had a little bit of a setback, a little bit of a problem, distraction on an off day. Who really cares. We’re going to make sure Matt gets to the plane and gets onboard, so he’ll be with us [today] to work out, I think.” \nGranderson said Harvey arriving late was not a big deal among the players. \n“We understand it’s a mistake. Mistakes have been made, especially over an eight-month season,” Granderson said. “If you look at everything that guys have done over the course of this season, whether it be being late or missing a meeting or doing something like that, it’s happened, and it’s not going to be the first or last time it will happen.” \nMATZ TO MOUND: Steven Matz is scheduled to start an instructional league game tonight and throw 90 to 95 pitches. If he performs well and feels OK, he should be on the postseason roster. \nThe team has yet to determine if he’ll be a starter or reliever, but barring any hiccups, it appears Matz will be the team’s No. 4 starter. If it’s not Matz, Bartolo Colon would start or Jacob deGrom would come back on short rest. \nSean Gilmartin is traveling with the team to Los Angeles in case Matz is not part of the roster. \nROSTER ALMOST SET: With Gilmartin heading to Los Angeles, and Carlos Torres heading to Florida to work out, the team’s final roster is pretty much set. \nThere will be 14 position players, six of them outfielders, and 11 pitchers. If Matz is healthy, the 11 pitching slots will go to four starters and the relieving core of Colon, Jon Niese, Hansel Robles, Addison Reed, Tyler Clippard, Jeurys Familia and Erik Goeddel. \nBRIEFS: Ruben Tejada is expected to start at shortstop Friday. … Michael Cuddyer will start in left field, and the left-handed hitting trio of Granderson, Daniel Murphy and Lucas Duda also will be in the lineup against southpaw Clayton Kershaw.
