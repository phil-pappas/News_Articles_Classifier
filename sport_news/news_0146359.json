Visiting Watterson seemed to be gaining momentum with each series.\nThen the floodgates opened for DeSales.\n>> Videos | Football highlights from around central Ohio \n>> High-school football results, box scores from Week 6 \nAlonzo Booth scored touchdowns 17 seconds apart early in the fourth quarter as DeSales drove to a 24-7 victory on a rainy, blustery night at Alumni Stadium. In the breakout performance of his career, the 6-foot, 235-pound junior tailback finished with 252 yards on 29 carries and three fourth-quarter touchdowns.\n“I’ve never done anything even close to this before, and to do it in the Watterson game is unbelievable,” said Booth, filling the role held by Michigan State-bound Austin Andrews, who is out for at least a month because of a torn knee ligament.\n“It was a tough night for us for a while, but our blocking and our defense carried us through. We were controlling the game, but we just needed something to get us going.”\nBooth, a transfer from Canal Winchester, broke free for a 37-yard touchdown run on the first play of the fourth quarter to make it 10-0.\nOn Watterson’s next play, a shotgun snap sailed well over the head of quarterback Stephen Markos, and DeSales’ Elijah Jones recovered at the 2. Booth plowed in on the next play to give the Stallions a seemingly safe 17-0 lead.\n“That was a really big sequence there,” Wiggins said. “Booth is a really good player. He was dinged up for a few weeks. You look at him, though, and he’s built to carry the load. We have high hopes for him. But it’s really a collective effort. The line play was terrific.”\nWatterson (3-3, 0-1), which still leads the series 35-24-1, responded with a 13-play, 80-yard scoring drive, capped by Markos’ 2-yard run. Then the Eagles recovered an onside kick. DeSales, however, held, and Booth tacked on a third touchdown late.\nAnchoring the defensive effort for DeSales (5-1, 1-0) were two-way lineman Derrius Mullins and sophomore linebacker Ty Van Fossen.\n“This is probably the best game we’ve had on both fronts,” said Mullins, a 6-foot-4, 320-pound junior and a Division I prospect. “We really wanted to prove ourselves tonight. Seeing how Booth performed was a real boost.\n“This was probably the most dominant performance DeSales has had against Watterson in recent years, but the scoreboard might not have indicated it. We were in total control of the game. A couple fumbles really helped them stay in the game. The game sort of had a strange feel to it until we broke through in the fourth quarter.”\nBogged down for most of the game, Watterson showed some spark in comeback mode in the fourth quarter. Chase Towns recovered a fumble and had two sacks for the Eagles.\nsblackledge@dispatch.com \n@BlackiePreps", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T04:22:15.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
