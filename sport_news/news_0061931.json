Jim Christiana \nState Rep. Jim Christiana remains involved in the campaigns for Republican candidates for Beaver County row offices.   7:00 pm Rep. Christiana's role in Beaver County campaigns becoming an election issue By J.D. Prose Calkins Media.   \nWith Beaver County elections less than three weeks away, state Rep. Jim Christiana’s involvement in row-office races has not diminished, and neither has the rancor it fuels among his opponents. \n“I just wish he would pay more attention to what’s going on in Harrisburg, especially now when we need to get a budget passed,” said Commissioners Chairman Tony Amadio, a Democratic commissioner candidate this year who has been a frequent target of Christiana over the years. \nChristiana, R-15, Beaver, ruffled political feathers in the spring when he orchestrated the upset victories of Republican commissioner candidates Dan Camp and Sandie Egley, who took the party’s two slots on the fall ballot and pushed out incumbent GOP Commissioner Dennis Nichols. \nAt that time, Christiana explained that he was frustrated with \"county leadership\" and said Camp and Egley would \"provide the personal characteristics and the work ethic to want to lead.\" \nChristiana also backed winning Republican sheriff candidate Tony Guy in the primary against retired Rochester police officer Sam Piccinini. \nAfter the primary, Christiana’s longtime aide Josh Konecheck left his $41,000-a-year “district constituent outreach specialist” job in Harrisburg to work on merging the two commissioner campaigns. \n“My goal was to help (Camp and Egley) get their campaigns off the ground,” Christiana said. \nOver the summer, Konecheck focused on the commissioners race and was paid by Camp and Egley, Christiana said. “That was not meant to be permanent,” Christiana said. \nAmid rumors that he had pulled Konecheck off the commissioners campaign last month, Christiana said he put Konecheck on the payroll for Citizens for Jim Christiana, the legislator’s campaign organization. \nIn that role, Christiana said, Konecheck has been fundraising for Christiana, who faces re-election next year, and working to help Republican candidates, not just Camp and Egley. Christiana insisted that the move does not indicate any unhappiness with first-time candidates Camp and Egley as they attempt to win a Republican majority. \nAny criticism over Konecheck’s role and whispers about his state job are a “shiny object” by opponents to distract voters from the issues, Christiana charged. \nChristiana also brushed off speculation that there was animosity between Camp and Egley after Camp pulled out of a planned Beaver County Chamber of Commerce debate, prompting Amadio and running mate Commissioner Joe Spanik also to withdraw. \nEven without her running mate, Egley said she was willing to participate. \n“They’re not going to agree on every step along the way, and neither will Joe and Tony,” Christiana said. “Everybody’s still on the same page.” \nAmadio said Christiana’s ambition is obvious with his political maneuverings this year. \n“He wants to be a kingmaker,” Amadio said. “It’s not going to work.” \nAnd, Amadio suggested that county voters could become educated \"real soon\" on Christiana’s political activities. \n“We’re going to let the people of Beaver County know what he did in the spring, what he did to a good commissioner in Dennis Nichols,” Amadio said. “Commissioner Nichols was a good commissioner, and (Christiana) took him out and we’re going to let the people know.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:18:18.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
