It was the longest run of Gallman’s career and the longest play from scrimmage this season for the Tigers, who held a 7-0 lead. \nCodrea Tankersley intercepted a Justin Thomas pass on the Jackets’ first possession and the Tigers turned it into a 21-yard field goal by Greg Huegel Greg Huegel #92 5-11, 180Blythewood, SC View Full Profile for a 10-0 lead barely three minutes into the game. However, a Ray-Ray McCloud Ray-Ray McCloud #34 5-9, 181Land O' Lakes, FL View Full Profile fumble on Clemson’s ensuing possession led to a 40-yard field goal by Tech’s Harrison Butker and Clemson led 10-3 with 6:52 remaining in the first quarter. \nThe Tigers forced a Tech three-and-out and then went on a 10-play, 80-yard drive that ended with a Gallman one-yard run for a 17-3 lead. On the ensuing drive, Tech was once again forced to punt, setting up one of the strangest plays of the day. The snap went over the head of punter Ryan Rodwell, who picked the errant snap up in the end zone and tried to punt. His kick bounced off of several Clemson defenders before bouncing out of the back of the endzone for a safety and a 19-3 Clemson lead. \nAnother three-and-out followed for the Jackets, and after a punt it took the Tigers just five plays to march 66 yards to paydirt. The drive ended with a 29-yard pass from Watson to Leggett for the 26-3 lead early in the second quarter. \nThe Jackets finally got a touchdown with just over five minutes remaining in the half, and it came through the air. The Jackets ran a fake punt earlier in the drive to push the ball near midfield, and Thomas hit a wide open Clinton Lynch in the middle of the field to complete a 50-yard touchdown toss that gave the Jackets new life, trailing just 26-10. \nHowever, the Tigers were able to put together a drive just before the half and Watson hit Leggett on a pretty fade in the endzone from eight yards out with just four seconds remaining. The touchdown gave Clemson a 33-10 lead at the break. Zac Brooks scores on a 35-yard run \nTech had two failed drives to start the second half, and Clemson got back on the board on its second drive after the break. The Tigers took over at their own 30-yard line, and it took just four plays to punch it in the end zone. Gallman started the drive with an 18-yard run, and following a loss of four yards on a sweep, Deon Cain took a quick pass from Watson and turned it into a 21-yard gain. Zac Brooks Zac Brooks #24 6-0, 200Jonesboro, AR View Full Profile took the next play 35 yards for the touchdown and a 40-10 lead with 5:06 remaining in the third quarter. \nThe following drive produced yet another Jacket punt, but a bad snap on the part of the Tigers was recovered in the endzone by Tech’s Andrew Gotsis for a touchdown and it was 40-17 late in the third. Clemson added a 42-yard field goal by Ammon Lakip Ammon Lakip #36 5-11, 200Alpharetta, GA View Full Profile – his first attempt of the season – and then led 43-17 early in the fourth quarter. \nTech still wouldn’t go away, however, and Ricky Jeune snuck behind the Clemson defense for a 46-yard pitch and catch with Thomas that made it 43-24 with 8:52 remaining in the contest.
