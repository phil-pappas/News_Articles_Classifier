Rather, he believes total plays have a significant impact on the outcome. The Eagles offense runs at its most efficient when the Eagles run more plays than the opponent, largely because of the cumulative impact those plays have on a defense. But Sunday, that formula didn't work.\nRyan Mathews strikes again: With the Eagles trailing 21-6 with 9:33 remaining in the third quarter, Mathews' 63-yard touchdown run was just what the offense needed after struggling to move the chains. Mathew finished with six carries for 97 yards and one touchdown while averaging 16.2 yards per rush.\nWelcome aboard, Byron Maxwell: Among the three Cam Newton interceptions forced by the Eagles was Byron Maxwell's first since signing a $63 million contract over the offseason. Maxwell was at the right place at the right time to catch a ball that bounced off of Panthers' receiver Devin Funchess.\nBAD:\nJason Peters injures his back: Seven-time Pro Bowl left tackle Jason Peters was carted off in the first quarter with a lower-back injury. Just as the offensive line finally had been developing some cohesion in recent weeks, which translated to improved play, Peters injury comes at the worst possible time. It's been a tough season for Peters, who has spent plenty of time on the ground or on the bench due to minor injuries through the first seven games.\nPenalties are becoming a trend: One week after committing two penalties against the Giants, the Eagles offensive line added four more, including a Jason Kelce holding call and two penalties on stalwart right tackle Lane Johnson. As if dropped passes weren't costly enough, penalties have played a key factor in the Eagles' offense's inability to establish consistent momentum.\nUGLY:\nDrops are the new normal for Jordan Matthews: After seven games, Matthews has at least six drops, including two against the Panthers. The first of Matthews' drops Sunday night came in the first quarter and was intercepted in a similar fashion to the game-ending interception against the Atlanta Falcons on opening night. On the second drop, the ball him in the hands on what would have been a third-down conversion.\nMatt Lombardo may be reached at MDLombardo@yahoo.com . @MattLombardo975 .
