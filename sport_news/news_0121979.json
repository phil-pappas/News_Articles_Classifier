The Blue Devils even scored touchdowns this time. They were sure to take advantage of most opportunities in a 44-3 romp Saturday afternoon at Michie Stadium. Duke racked up five touchdowns, converting several times after taking possession with ideal field position. “Just being able to finish,” Duke coach David Cutcliffe said, noting the first touchdown with 1:11 left in the first quarter. “That started the ball rolling.” Jela Duncan and backup quarterback Parker Boehme scored two touchdowns each and Ross Martin made three field goals, all contributing to subduing a sellout crowd of 39,712. The Blue Devils spread out the scoring after relying on three Martin field goals to beat Boston College a week earlier. Duke is 5-1 for the second year in a row, the first consecutive seasons with such a record since 1952 and 1953. It’s the fourth time a Duke opponent has failed to reach the double-digit point total this season. Army (1-5) reached the Duke 2-yard line with a first down in the third quarter, then committed its third turnover of the game and the score remained at 30-3. “You’ve got to give a lot of credit to our defense,” quarterback Thomas Sirk said. A downside for Duke came earlier in the third quarter when defensive end Kyler Brown, safety Deondre Singleton and defensive tackle Carlos Wray departed with injuries. Cutcliffe said there’s reason for particular concern about Brown and Singleton. On offense, the Blue Devils were turnover-free. “We felt like we were prepared, had a little edge, which proved true,” Cutcliffe said. Duke capitalized on Army’s gratuity throughout the game. “We definitely got the ball out a few times,” Duke safety Jeremy Cash said of creating turnovers. Army picked up a fourth-and-1 from its own 24-yard line in the first quarter. Three plays later — all runs by Army senior quarterback A.J. Schurr — resulted in fourth-and-1 from the 35, with Schurr exiting with an injury. The Cadets went for it anyway, with backup quarterback Ahmad Bradshaw’s fourth-down pitchout resulting in a fumble and Duke taking over at the Army 17. Sirk threw a 9-yard touchdown strike to tight end Erich Schneider. Army’s next possession ended on Bradshaw’s fumbled snap, with linebacker Ben Humphreys recovering at the Army 32. Boehme’s 3-yard touchdown run sent the Blue Devils to a 17-0 lead. Duncan’s 43-yard touchdown run pushed the edge to 24-0. It was Duncan’s first touchdown since 2013 against Navy. Page 2 of 2 - “I just saw daylight and I just went in,” he said of a play that included a couple of Army defenders clinging to him as he tumbled into the end zone. “I didn’t want to be denied.” He added a 1-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. Boehme scored from 5 yards out with 10:18 left, shortly after the Blue Devils gained possession off an Army interception. Earlier, it was redshirt junior receiver Anthony Nash at work. He caught three passes accounting for 40 yards on the game’s first possession. That matched his season total for catches. The drive resulted in Martin’s 40-yard field goal, giving him 12 consecutive Duke points covering two games. Those marked the first points of the season for Duke on an opening possession. Martin finished with three field goals again, though this game there were touchdowns to go with those. ■ EXTRA POINTS …: Duke freshman receiver T.J. Rahming, who was the team’s leading receiver with 19 catches and 242 yards through five games, missed the game with a leg injury sustained during practice. … Duke has shut out opponents in the first half four times this season. … Redshirt junior Corbin McCarthy of Duke had his first career interception in the fourth quarter. … Duke is off next weekend, playing again Oct. 24 at Virginia Tech.
