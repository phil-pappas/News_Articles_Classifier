Gibson carried the ball 11 times for 52 yards on the drive. \nYet the offense nearly hiccuped as CBE reached the red zone. \nOn a third down and goal, from the 14-yard line, Lamb rolled out to his left in search of a target on his first pass of the game. \nHe couldn't see a thing. \nNorristown defenders swarmed, arms raised and coming fast. \nBut Lamb, a run-first quarterback, was prepared. \nHe said after the game that the Patriots run plenty of scramble drills in practice, and it showed as he spun out of a defender's grip and looked to the right side of the field. \nThere Gibson stood, waving his arms frantically, eager to bail his friend and teammate out of a jam. \n\"They brought a lot of guys on that play, and Jack was just kind of scrambling around,\" Gibson said. \"He did a great job with his feet, and luckily I was on the backside of the play, and we just kept it alive.\" \nLamb managed to lob it to Gibson, who pivoted and was surprised to find no defenders between him and the end zone. \nIt was the first of three touchdowns for Gibson, who Lamb said \"has the ability to take it and score on any given play.\" \nThis is the senior Gibson's first season at C.B. East with five wins in a season. He said the fifth win was a personal landmark victory. \nIf he keeps running like he did Saturday, number six can't be far away. \nCentral Bucks East 7 13 10 7 - 37 \nNorristown 0 7 0 14 - 21 \nCBE: Alex Gibson 14 pass from Jack Lamb (Kiel Kittleson kick) \nCBE: Gibson 11 run (Kittleson kick) \nCBE: FG Kittleson 24 \nN: Khalif Sinclair 59 run (Shane Hammer kick) \nCBE: FG Barney Amor 39 \nCBE: FG Kittleson 27 \nCBE: Lamb 1 run (Kittleson kick) \nCBE: Gibson 1 run (Amor kick) \nN: Simeon McCray 18 pass from Desmond Gorski (Hammer kick) \nN: McCray 70 pass from Gorski (Hammer kick)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:31:50.837+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
