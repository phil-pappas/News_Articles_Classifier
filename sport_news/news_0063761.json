Reed Stadium in Jefferson City. \nThe Greyhounds got a 92-yard punt return from Reece Horn with 7:25 left in the first quarter to start the scoring. \nIndianapolis then made it 10-0 at the 1:55 mark of the first when Brad Schickel drilled a 25-yard field goal. \nThe Greyhounds tacked on three more scores in the second quarter to make it 27-0 by halftime. \nFirst, it was Andrew Walker scoring on a 6-yard run just 11 seconds into the period. Then with 8:08 left before intermission, Schickel struck again, this time nailing a 22-yard field goal. Finally, with 1:46 left in the half, Walker scored on a 6-yard run. \nWalker kept up his onslaught in the third quarter, adding a 1-yard touchdown run at the 9:36 mark before scoring from 12 yards out with 2:46 left in the frame. \nThe Blue Tigers finally got on the board 46 seconds into the final period when Keith Lakey scored on a 3-yard run. The PAT kick failed, leaving the score at 41-6. \nThen with 1:57 left, Lincoln’s Antwon Davis caught a 28-yard touchdown pass from wide receiver Bryson Winfrey on a trick play. The 2-point pass failed, keeping it at 41-12. \nThree short rushes for Indianapolis and two Lincoln timeouts helped the Blue Tigers get the ball back with 50 seconds remaining at their own 36. \nThat was enough time for the Blue Tigers to march down the field and Davis caught a 13-yard scoring pass from Owen Jordan as time expired. \nThe Greyhounds held a slim 302-253 edge in total yardage. They completed 11-of-19 passes for 104 yards and rushed the ball 51 times for 198 yards. \nLincoln, meanwhile, completed 11-of-24 passes for 155. Jordan hit on 9-of-22 for 106 from the quarterback spot, while Winfrey completed a pair of pass attempts for 49 yards. \nThe Blue Tigers managed just 98 rushing yards on 37 carries. Dominique Bell led the way with 58 yards on 10 carries. \nKareem Joyner led the Lincoln defense with 11 tackles, including seven solo stops. \nIndianapolis is now 7-1 overall and 5-0 in the Great Lakes Valley Conference, while Lincoln falls to 1-7 and 0-5. \nThe Blue Tigers return to action Saturday when they travel to McKendree. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:11:06.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
