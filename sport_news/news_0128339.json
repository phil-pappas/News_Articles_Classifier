(Photo: Bryon Houlgrave, The Register) Buy Photo Story Highlights Canzieri honored as Big Ten player of the week Senior rushed for 256 yards on school-record 43 carries \nIOWA CITY, Ia. – Jordan Canzeri demolished the notion that his best 15 carries are his first 15 carries, and in doing so has become Iowa’s fourth Big Ten player of the week this season. \nThe 5-foot-9, 192-pound senior from Troy, N.Y., was honored as the conference’s offensive player of the week Monday after rushing 43 times for 256 yards and scoring two touchdowns in the No. 17 Hawkeyes’ 29-20 home win over Illinois on Saturday. \nThe third-highest rushing total in school history was almost entirely assembled from carries 17 through 43. Canzeri netted 30 yards on his first 16 carries against the Illini (1.88 average); he gained 226 on his final 27 (8.37 average). \nOn Iowa’s statement drive of the game, after Illinois cut the Hawkeyes’ lead to 23-20 with 10 minutes, 13 seconds to go, Canzeri carried the ball on 11 straight play calls – netting 59 yards, 6:53 of possession time and a Marshall Koehn field goal. \n“That last drive in particular, he never even looked at the bench – even giving an inkling that he wanted to come out,” Ferentz said during his weekly Sunday conversation with the university’s website. “He had 11 carries in that possession. That, to me, was maybe as big a series as we had in the football game. He got good blocking there, but a big, big part of that was his effort and determination.” \nHawkeyes have been honored by the Big Ten in four of the last five weeks. Joining Canzeri on this list are quarterback C.J. Beathard (offense, after his 292 total yards keyed a 31-17 win at Iowa State); Koehn (special teams, after his 57-yard field goal beat Pittsburgh, 27-24); and cornerback Desmond King (defense, after his two interceptions led a 10-6 win at Wisconsin). \nCanzeri's 43 carries broke Sedrick Shaw's school record of 42, which came as a surprise to Ferentz who doesn't believe in pitch counts in baseball, either. \n“I would’ve guessed somewhere maybe in the low 30s,” Ferentz said.
