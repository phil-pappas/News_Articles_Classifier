Then I sank that amazing (50ft) putt on 15 which gave me a cushion. \n\n\"Sixteen and 17 are two tough golf holes and it was breezy and cold but I played them well, made two good shots and two good putts at 17, so it was nice to go to the 18th with a two-shot lead. \n\n\"As I said, it's been a really tough year and to hold this trophy is unbelievable. There are a lot of people behind me, my coaches and my family, so I have to say a big 'thank you' to all of them,\" concluded the Dane. \n\nThe diminutive Olesen (1.75m/5ft 9in), who hails from Fureso, some 20km from Copenhagen, tied for second at this event in 2010, and won his first tournament at the Sicilian Open in April 2012 before adding his second win in 2014 when he finished three shots clear of French number one Victor Dubuisson at the Perth International. \n\nHis best results at a major are a tie for sixth at the 2013 Masters and a share of ninth at the 2012 British Open at Royal Lytham & St Annes. \n\nAnother Danish player Soren Kjeldsen was part of a four-player group on 14-under and tied for ninth alongside Scotland's David Drysdale, American Stewart Cink and David Horsey of England.
