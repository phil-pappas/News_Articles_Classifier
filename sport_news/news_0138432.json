I'm still in shock,\" Armitstead said. \"Everything went perfectly.\"\nArmitstead won five medals at the world track championships in 2009 and 2010 before turning to the road events, where she won the 2014 Commonwealth Games and took silver at the 2012 Olympics, the first medal won by a Briton at the London Games.\nShe has also won the past two World Cup crowns, but she will not be pushing for a third, her focus squarely upon the Olympics.\n\"It would be unrealistic to target (that), especially in an Olympic year. It won't be a goal,\" she said.\n\"I'm goal oriented. If you have won something once, that's enough. To me, this is a massive take in my career.\"\nIn part, it came because Armitstead developed the plan of attack over a course that offered cobblestone climbs, a rise before the finish line and a host of top rivals.\n\"It was attack and sprint,\" Armitstead said. \"It raised some eyebrows when I said I thought that was the best way to attack.\n\"I believed in myself. I got it right today.\"\nDutch star Marianne Vos, the reigning Olympic champion and a three-time world champion, has been sidelined by injuries since June, but Armitstead dismissed any notion her victory was less special with Vos absent.\n\"No disrespect to Marianne Vos, she's the greatest rider of our time, it wasn't just about Marianne Vos being away today,\" she said. \"The rest of women's cycling has made some incredible strides.\"\nLong before she won, Armitstead feared the race was lost after nine riders broke away with 25km remaining.\n\"I was getting quite frustrated by the racing, wondering when it would start,\" she said. \"That was because I had good legs. The course was quite demanding.\n\"With about a lap to go I thought, 'This could be over.' I couldn't charge on my own. Until we caught them, I thought, 'It's over.'\"\nNot until after the penultimate climb did the peloton catch the breakaway leaders, setting up a daunting climb and sprint to the finish.\n\"The last 5km was quite demanding and it was all about positioning,\" said Armitstead, who went to the right and surged into the lead awaiting a charge.\n\"I was waiting for the rush of the sprint to come. Anna came and that was it. It was all about the line. The finish line came quicker than I expected.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-09-27T18:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:33:40.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
