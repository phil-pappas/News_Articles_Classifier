And they have to play at least four of them without the one player they haven’t been able to win without.\nStarting Saturday against Columbus (7 p.m., MSG), the Red Bulls will be without 20-year-old rising star Matt Miazga, who will miss two during Olympic qualifying with the US Under-23 National Team and two more for suspension. Considering they are winless in the six games he hasn’t started, his absence couldn’t come at a worse time.\n“I do think those figures say a lot,’’ Red Bulls coach Jesse Marsch told the Post. “He’s a large part of our team success. Matt’s been a very big player for us. One factor that was different in most of those games …was we didn’t have Ronald [Zubar].\n“He can prove to be a player. I’m anxious for Ronald to show the kind of player he is and the value he brings. There’s potential that Ronald steps in and the team doesn’t miss a beat, and could be even better.’’\nThat’s asking a lot. In games Miazga has started, the Red Bulls are 14-4-5 for 46 points, outscoring their foes 46-25. When he sits, they’re 0-2-4 for just two points and have been outscored 12-5. Small wonder U-23 coach Andi Herzog gushed over Miazga, saying a call-up to the senior national team is imminent.\n“He’s one of the most talented center backs in the US, and hopefully he’ll have participation in the future in the men’s national team in a couple of months. Not in years, but hopefully in the next couple of months,’’ Herzog said. “He’s playing a big part in one of the best teams in the league for the New York Red Bulls, and I expect a lot of him to be a key player in the back line.’’\nOlympic qualifying will force Miazga to miss Saturday’s match and next Wednesday’s contest against\nMontreal. A two-match suspension (one for a red card, another for accumulation of yellow cards) will cost him Oct. 14 vs. Toronto and Oct. 18 vs. the Union.\nOn Saturday – coming off a 5-2 home loss to expansion Orlando – the Red Bulls face Golden Boot leader Kei Kamara and his 22 goals. They need Zubar to step in, play well and — most of all — stay healthy.\n“I don’t see it as a challenge,” Zubar said. “I challenge myself to play hard, make sure the other team doesn’t score. I’m here to make sure we don’t concede a goal. I don’t focus about patterns. My job … is to make sure we’re strong enough to limit their chances, make sure Columbus doesn’t score goals. For us, [Miazga] is piece in the game. But we have to show up and do the business on the field.’’\nSpeaking of business, Miazga has just one year left on his deal, and has been offered a long-term extension. But he’s switched agents to a group with European contacts, and has a Polish passport that will make a European transfer easier. The next month could be a peek at the Miazga-less future.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under jesse marsch ,  matt miazga ,  new york red bulls ,  ronald zubar", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T13:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:33:43.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
