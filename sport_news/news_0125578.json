In her career, she’s averaged 10 points and 6.9 rebounds a night, but her season was cut short last year with a fractured fibula. All reports indicate she’s at 100 percent and will be the spark of the team. — Marjorie Butler (G, Sr., 5-8) was ranked eighth in the SEC last season in assists (3.1 per game) and fourth in assist-to-turnover ratio (1.3) and will no doubt be the quarterback on the court for the Lady Bulldogs. She started 28 games last season and averaged 26 minutes per night. — Tiaria Griffin (G, Sr., 5-7) was the only Georgia player to start all 31 games last year, a testament to her tenacity (she also averaged 30.6 minutes per game). She’s a deadly 3-point shooter, but her turnovers (52) almost matched her assists (53) a year ago. — Mackenzie Engram (F, So., 6-2) was named to the SEC’s All-Freshman team, and rightly so, and playing more consistently will be a goal. Although she’s viewed as the leader of the future, don’t be surprised to see her take on that mantle to some degree this winter. — Merritt Hempe (F, Sr., 6-2) missed five games last year due to illness but is back and ready to fight with the conference’s toughest players in the frontcourt. She has averaged 6.4 points and 4.1 rebounds per game in her career and she and Engram should be a formidable tandem underneath for Georgia. \nOnlineAthens.com aims to foster constructive, respectful civic conversation.
