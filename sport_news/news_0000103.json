Petitions have been filed in the Supreme Court on behalf of three infants by their parents seeking action against pollution in Delhi, which is said to have the worst air in the world. It is a problem that according to some estimates causes more than 80 premature deaths every day. But just because the petition points to noise and air pollution from crackers during Dussehra and Diwali, there is a particular brand of people who have turned the debate on social media to Hindu festivals being targeted. This amounts to contributing to the ill health of children and the weak, whose lungs are particularly vulnerable. It is a few years now that air pollution in Delhi — along with 12 other cities in India that figure among the world's worst 20 - has been a matter of intense debate. The action, however, has lagged woefully. The growth of vehicles and other sources of pollution such as construction and industry has far outstripped benefits from initiatives such CNG buses and the Metro. After Gurgaon, Delhi proposes to introduce weekly car-free days. But these proposals appeal to the better sense of residents, which is a fundamental weakness in the initiatives. As against the promise of better air sometime in future, the immediate convenience of personal conveyance over public transport, which is severely inadequate, wins out hands down with people. No solution that will have a meaningful impact is going to be convenient. It will have to be coercive measures such as heavy taxation on car use or forcible removal of a portion of personal vehicles from roads on a given day by various means. Given the sensitivities between the AAP government in Delhi and the BJP at the Centre, political courage to implement any strong measures may not be forthcoming. That makes the latest plea - made dramatic by the age of the petitioners — all the more important. Court intervention may, unfortunately, be the only device that works in the end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:07:51.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
