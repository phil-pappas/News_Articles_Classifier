By Eric W. BolinArkansas News Bureau • ebolin@arkansasnews.com \nFAYETTEVILLE — Gus Malzahn offenses are best when he has a quarterback with nimble feet, one who can get around the edges of the offensive line and pick up yards in chunks. A quarterback adept at pulling off gadget plays here and there, too, has been a Malzahn staple. \nBrandon Allen is not, generally, one of those kind of players. \nHe also isn’t Malzahn’s quarterback. He’s Bret Bielema’s. And in a day filled with trolling, purposeful or otherwise, the grandest irony was Bielema beating his rival Malzahn and Auburn with a quarterback not built for those quarterback-keepers and trickery, but executing them, anyway, against the most successful elder of the flamboyant style. \nAllen and Bielema together made good on all their promise. The quarterback erased lingering doubts about his late-game effectiveness and the coach one-upped his polarizing formerly-local counterpart. And they did it with taste of Malzahn’s playbook via Dan Enos. \nFour overtimes were required. Arkansas lost leads of 14 points, seven points, three points and seven points. The Razorbacks also overcame a deficit of eight points — and that at the end — and beat Auburn, 54-46, in four sets of extra periods on Saturday. It vaulted Arkansas out of the SEC West cellar and sent Auburn spiraling into it. And it restored some faith a Bielema-and-Allen led team still had some things to show in the final six games of the season. \n“Once we got past the first (overtime), really, I felt like we were going to win this one, no matter how many it takes,” Allen said. “Every time we’ve gone into overtime, we’ve struggled in that first one. Kind of did again in the first overtime again, but we were able to get over it. I think after we got over that hump, we kind of got rolling.” \nThe first play of the fourth overtime saw Allen complete a pass to wide receiver Drew Morgan on the near sideline. Morgan side-stepped his defender and sprinted nearly the whole 25 yards to the end zone to put Arkansas ahead by the eventual final score. \nA secondary burned about 40 real-time minutes earlier was still needed to close. They did so in style, forcing Auburn quarterback Sean White into three straight incompletions, including a final one on 4th-and-9 from the Tigers 24. When Josh Liddell broke up the last-gasp pass to Ricardo Louis, the Razorbacks players sprinted from the sideline in joy. \nThere was no begrudging. The win wasn’t the caliber of last year’s against LSU, the first Southeastern Conference victory of the Bielema tenure, but it seemed to carry as much emotional baggage. Arkansas had blown fourth-quarter leads of six points or more seven times in the last two-and-a-half years. The Razorbacks had never overcome a deficit in a fourth quarter to win. The team had never even collected an overtime first down in Bielema’s time at the helm. \nAllen was the most chided for those failures. Calls for his removal as starter were not uncommon. As he left the field following the team’s celebration Saturday, remaining fans, of which there were plenty, in the northwest corner of the end zone rained praise and applause. \nAllen was 7 of 10 for 63 yards and two touchdowns in extra time. He also caught a pass and went 11 yards for a first down to start the second overtime period. Two plays after that Kody Walker ran into the end zone to provide Arkansas a 38-31 lead. \nIt was the most inventive play of an Arkansas day filled with atypical offensive sets. Enos, the Arkansas offensive coordinator, nearly exhausted his playbook. Misdirection tosses, never a part of Bielema-coached offenses until this season, picked up first downs, touchdowns and two-point conversions. End-arounds and jet sweeps were called a handful of times. Allen even took the ball straight to the outside on specifically-called quarterback keepers a pair of times. \nThe whole set looked like something out of Malzahn’s brain. But former Arkansas offensive coordinator didn’t have the personnel to either counter or execute any of it. Auburn receivers dropped, unofficially, seven passes. One of those came on the final Tigers drive and was dropped in the end zone. \n“We’ve got to catch the ball. We’ve just got to catch the ball and do a better job of it,” Malzahn said. “You know, I’ve been coaching for 25 years, so I’m sure I’ve seen a little bit of everything. But we’ve got to do a better job catching the ball.” \nHe relied almost exclusively on Peyton Barber. Auburn had to after seven drops plagued its wide receivers. One of those came in the final overtime and could have pulled the Tigers to within two points. Barber had 37 carries for 120 yards and four touchdowns. Three of the scores came after regulation. He started overtime with a two-yard score, tied the game at 38 after Walker’s three-yarder, then put Auburn ahead immediately on the next drive with a punch from one yard. \nAnd when Melvin Ray caught a wide-open pass in that northwest corner of the end zone for the two-point conversion, Allen’s legacy was there for the taking or demolition. \nAllen completed three passes in the back-half of the third overtime — to Hunter Henry for six yards, Drew Morgan for seven and Morgan again for five — to bring Arkansas to the Auburn four. A misdirection toss to Walker saw the running back, in his first game in over a month, clear to pylon and the Auburn lead cut to two points. \nWhen forced, per rules, to go for the tie, Allen rolled quickly, athletically to his right searched for a receiver. Jeremy Sprinkle made himself available right on the goal line and a zipped pass between defenders found the tight end just inside the line for the score. \nMorgan’s touchdown reception followed and another two-pointer, a pass to Walker, followed. \nThere were no boos, scattered or otherwise, headed Allen’s direction. The shadow was lifted. \n“It’s a lot more fun, I can tell you that,” Allen said. “We always knew we could make plays. I’ve always had confidence in the guys that we could do it and tonight we just put it together and got the win. It was a great win for the team.” \nThose old follies threatened for a good chunk of the game, though. Arkansas dominated the first quarter and half the second. Auburn had just 31 yards on 14 plays over its first four drives. The Razorbacks had only moderate success in taking advantage. Dominique Reed scored on an 11-yard run in the first quarter and Sprinkle caught a 23-yard touchdown pass to start the second, but Arkansas was not making the most of its yards gained. \nAuburn finally was able to string together positive-yardage plays at the end of the second. Barber capped a 16-play, 96-yard drive with a one-yard touchdown run and the Tigers trailed by seven points going into halftime. Jason Smith tied the game for Auburn on the first drive of the second half with a nine-yard score. \nThe teams traded scores — Alex Collins and Jeremy Johnson each had rushing touchdowns before a Cole Hedlund field goal with 1:07 left forced Auburn’s hand. And Arkansas nearly reverted to its old ways. \nTevin Beanum appeared to sack White on the ensuing Auburn drive. The ball came out and Arkansas had recovered and it was called as such on the field. Upon review, however, White was called for an incomplete pass and Auburn was stayed. The quarterback hit Ricardo Louis for gains of 20 and 28 yards on two of the next three plays to set up a 41-yard field goal from Daniel Carlson which tied the game and ultimately sent it to overtime. \nDespite White’s ability to find Louis late in regulation, Bielema wanted to force the redshirt freshman of four career starts to beat him on the game’s final drive. \n“We felt if we could make that quarterback throw the ball in overtime, we could win this game,” Bielema said. “I believe they tried to run on first down, maybe gained a yard and then it was three straight passes that we defended and one bounced off a guy’s hands. \n“You’ve got to have the big man upstairs help us once in a while and he did.” \nThere was no post-game war of words between the two coaches. None were expected, either, but the Bielema and Malzahn have had their share of less-than-courteous exchanges in the past. And it was not unnoticed Bielema sported a visor Saturday, a look that is a Malzahn staple. Bielema almost never wears headgear. \nBielema deflected questions about it, saying his wife, Jen, had suggested his day’s attire. He was not about to get reeled into another exchange about the Auburn coach. Instead he talked up his quarterback. Bielema was just as happy to see Allen the hero as he was he was to get the win at all. \nAllen took a hard hit after being tackled on his pass reception. He took a few more on his six carries. By the end, his limp noticeable. Allen has been banged around a lot in his three seasons as starter. He is on this fourth offensive coordinator in five years. And he has taken the criticism without blinking. \n“I was a little concerned after that quarterback-pass because he was really hobbling, but it just shows how amazing and resilient and tough he is,” Bielema said “I just said ‘You all right to go?’ because I had a feeling we were going to keep going a little bit more and he was like ‘absolutely.’ … Hopefully this is a catalyst for him to finish this thing off on a high note for him personally.” \nBielema would have preferred not to give up game-tying drive at the end of regulation, but it also served as an exorcism of sorts. It was this point last season the Razorbacks began their march to bowl-eligibility. Saturday may have been a harbinger of the same. Arkansas must go 3-2 over its final five games to reach the bowl threshold. \n“Everybody else always worries about how are you going to bring them (the players) back or how are they going to respond or are they going to be able to persevere? They’re just so resilient,” Bielema said. “Now you just hope they’re getting a little bit of that mojo curve.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T11:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T11:20:45.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
