Now just a year removed from taking tips from the departed duo, Maten must now drop knowledge on the freshmen. \n“I feed them tips so they don’t have to go through everything that I went through,\" Maten said. \"Just constantly trying to give them little tips of wisdom. It’s not too hard. I approached with a good mentality.” \nIn his first season Maten averaged 5.0 points per game and 4.3 rebounds per game. He also led the team in blocks and posted a team best defensive rating of 95.8 points per 100 possessions while on the floor. \nTeam health \nSnake bitten is not a strong enough word to describe the 2014-15 Georgia Bulldogs. Several starters and key contributors missed time due to injuries. Perhaps the most damaging was the foot injury that Kenny Gaines suffered at the end of the season. \nGaines missed the final regular season game against Auburn as well as Georgia’s second game in the SEC Tournament due to the injury. He gutted it out against Michigan State in the NCAA Tournament, but was limited to only 20 minutes in the season-ending defeat. \nGaines rated the pain in his foot as a 9.3 on a scale of 1-10 and contemplated surgery on the foot. But after he spoke with A.J. Turman of the football team, Gaines opted against it and spent the offseason slowly recovering from his injury. \nGaines was a full go when practice started on Oct. 5. Gaines was one of the team’s best perimeter shooters as well as the team’s best perimeter defender. \nFox reiterated how injuries kept Georgia from reaching its full potential last season. Now with improved depth he thinks this team is better equipped to handle the ups and downs of a season. \n“We feel like we’re deeper and a little more athletic than we were last year,” Fox said. “Last year with the injuries we got so restrictive on how we could play.” \nGoing small \nIt’s no secret the strength of the Georgia basketball team is in its backcourt. Charles Mann, Gaines and J.J. Frazier finished first, third and fourth in minutes per game last season. The team also brings in freshman Will Jackson, a guard with similar measurable to Mann at 6-foot-4 and 185 pounds. \nWith the strength of the backcourt and the lack of experience in the front court — Maten is the only meaningful contributor to return from last season’s team — there is some thought that Fox could opt to use four guards around Maten to play to the team’s strengths. \nTo start the season, Fox isn’t going all in on a small lineup. \n“I think we have some flexibility, but I think we will start out fairly traditional until some guys get comfortable.” \nThat more than likely means Georgia could play Ogbeide upfront and have Kenny Paul Geno start at the small forward, leaving Jackson and Frazier as the first guys off the bench. It could also mean that Mann play small forward at times, something he did last season, allowing Frazier to slide into the starting lineup. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:31:29.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
