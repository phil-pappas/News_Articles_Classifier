(AP) - A 41-year-old man has pleaded guilty to tampering with milk while employed at a dairy farm near Crystal Springs, Mississippi.\nU.S. Attorney Gregory K. Davis and Patrick Munday, acting special agent in charge of the U.S. Department of Agricutlure's Office of Inspector General, says Alfred Thornhill entered the plea to tampering with a consumer product Tuesday before U.S. District Judge Daniel P. Jordan III.\nThornhill, of Wesson, worked at the dairy farm, when he poured chlorine, acid and bleach into a stainless steel container of milk right after the milk had been collected from the cows on March 28, 2014. The toxic chemicals were discovered by the farm's owner just before the milk was to be picked up for transportation to a distribution center in New Orleans.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
