Dallas police Deputy Chief Rob Sherwin says Johnson admitted to killing the jogger with a \"large-edged weapon\" in a random act of rage on the White Rock Creek Trail early Monday. Johnson was arrested after calling 911 from a nearby equestrian center. Johnson is being held without bond. Jail records don't list an attorney who could comment on his behalf. Authorities haven't released the victim's name. Johnson played for the Aggies in 2012. He had three catches for 22 yards in A&M's 29-24 win at top-ranked Alabama. He disappeared a few days later and wasn't seen until he appeared at his family's Dallas home three days later.
