It looked like mission accomplished for Kurzejewski. That was until the left rear tire on his Costy’s Energy Services Chevrolet began to lose air pressure with less than 10 laps remaining. With the car's handling worsening, his title hopes were being jeopardized. \nKurzejewski told arcarracing.com that the car was a “handful” to drive and that he wanted to pit for new tires, but Bob Keselowski told him to stay out because he risked dropping out of the top 10. \nKurzejewski held on to finish ninth and preserve the tile by a five-point margin over Enfinger, who himself, clinched his first overall ARCA Racing Series presented by Menards championship. Dan Kurzejewski, Matt's father, owns the Chevy race car which sported pink accents over its main black body color for Breast Cancer Awareness. \nAfterwards, Keselowski, the older brother of NASCAR Sprint Cup champion Brad Keselowski, tweeted a photo of the tire with a gash down the middle. He tweeted, “How we finished, I have no idea.” \nHad Kurzejewski finished just one spot back in 10th, the title would have gone to Enfinger, who would have won the tie-breaker by virtue of competing in more races in 2015. \n“This is the first point championship I’ve ever tried for and ever won,” Kurzejewski told arcaracing.com. “What a great feeling.” \nIt was consistency that won the series rookie the title. Kurzejewski had eight top-10 finishes in nine starts, with three of them being top-fives. He led 118 laps and had a career-best third at Pocono in August. Prior to this year, Kurzejewski had completed in five ARCA races over three seasons. \nKurzejewski will be recognized for his accomplishment at the ARCA postseason awards banquet Dec. 12 in Indianapolis.
