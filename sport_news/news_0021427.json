They are being sliced and diced and then fried in every conceivable way. This season that came from nowhere, this season of hope and pride and an excitement we haven’t known before, could end as early as Wednesday evening. \nJust like that — like a knockout punch we didn’t see coming. \nWithout a real fight. Without a meaningful battle. Without the Jays playing like the Jays. \nMaybe there will be another game on Friday at Kauffman Stadium. Maybe not. In reality, these seem to be two teams passing in the night: One heading to the World Series, the other heading home to an off-season full of questions, home to sadly wonder what could have been and what isn’t now. \nYou could see some of the Blue Jays’ anger and frustration in the face of centre fielder Kevin Pillar and hear it in his words after the rather ridiculous and embarrassing 14-2 loss to the Royals in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series. Somebody had to say something. \nSo why not Pillar? \n“What are we talking about?” he said rather loudly, trying to get to his locker post-game, being blocked by a bevy of reporters who were surrounding Cliff Pennington, the second baseman who pitched on Tuesday night. \nThere was incredulity around the scene after the defeat, reporters and cameras looking to get a word about the freakish nature of Pennington pitching the final outs of a game that was clearly out of control. \nThere was an incongruity about the scene, about a second baseman coming in to pitch for the first time in playoff history, and some thinking it to be a story, about the Jays getting sand kicked in their faces at the worst possible time in this wondrous season. \n“What are these questions, they’re asking?” asked Pillar to no one in particular. \nAnd then he paused by shouting: “I am angry!” \nHe is angry. You are angry. Toronto is angry. There is every reason to be. \nWhat we thought, what they thought, what we expected, what they expected, what so many hoped for is all coming apart in what is looking like a mirage-like ALCS. It isn’t like there is anyone to singularly blame: It’s more like there is everyone to blame. \nThe Royals look like a great team. \nThe Blue Jays look to be playing the part of also-rans. \nThe Jays needed starting pitching to win this series. That was one of their strengths coming in — just not in the first four games of the series. \nThey haven’t had a sustainable reasonable start from any of their playoff starters. The starters — Marco Estrada, David Price, Marcus Stroman, R.A. Dickey — have gone 20 innings, allowed 16 earned runs: The team starting earned-run average in the series is 7.20. \nAnd Dickey, taking a page from the Tom Candiotti school of terrible playoff knuckleball pitching in Toronto, was dreadful. He couldn’t make it through the second inning and that wasn’t because manager John Gibbons pulled him early and didn’t believe in him, the narrative of a playoff round ago. He took him out because it was time to yank him. \nDickey faced 12 Kansas City batters, retired five of them, gave up two home runs, hit one, walked two, and threw a wild pitch that was scored a passed ball. \nNothing in the mighty Jays arsenal seems right about now. The Royals have hit more home runs than the uber-powerful Blue Jays. They have more than twice the number of extra-base hits. The disparity in run differential — the Jays were plus-221, the Royals plus-83 — seems pretty meaningless in a series in which the three Blue Jays defeats have been by a cumulative score of 25-5. \nIn their three defeats, the best offence in baseball has mustered zero, three and two runs. That might work with brilliant pitching. But there hasn’t been a whole lot of that. The giant Kansas City bullpen has pitched 17 innings in the series, allowed three runs. An earned-run average of 1.58. \nThe Blue Jays’ relievers have pitched 15 innings, given up 16 earned runs — and that’s including the rather brilliant four-plus innings Liam Hendriks threw in giving Toronto a chance in Game 4. The Jays’ bullpen’s earned-run average in the series: 9.60. \nAnd that’s your series. \nThe Royals have hit better and harder, played better defence, strung more hits together, run the bases with a vengeance, and gotten away with a just an ordinary starting rotation. They look deeper than the Jays, sharper, more focused, more ready to play for or win a World Series. \nIn the Jays clubhouse, aside from the external angst of Pillar and the disappearance of those who only appear after wins, there was Russell Martin, a little bruised, a little battered, fully understanding what they’re up against, not ready to concede anything. \n“It’s win-or-go-home time,” said Martin. “And I don’t feel like going home.” ALCS Game 4, Blue Jays vs. Royals Previous Next \nR.A.
