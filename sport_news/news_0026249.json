So far the team is a perfect 5-0 and they're outscoring their opponents 30-12, which they say comes from great chemistry early on.\"Coach is putting some guys together that really get along well on the ice,\" said Maulers forward Chris LaPorte. \"We know where each other are at all times, we're great talking to each other.\"\"That's part of the fun of watching a team grow is seeing how they come along and seeing how they progress early in the season,\" said Maulers head coach Marcus Baxter. \"So yeah, they seem to be coming along nicely.\"Making Missoula's hot start to the season even more impressive is the fact that the Maulers have been on the road for four of their first five games, but that's about to change for Missoula. Four of their next five games will take place in Missoula at Glacier Ice Rink. The Maulers say no other team in their division has as great of a \"home ice' advantage as their fans give them here in Missoula.\"Playing here on a home night is better than any feeling I've ever had,\" said LaPorte, who's a Missoula native. \"Two thousand fans that are great, they're nice and loud.\"\"Our fan base is incredible,\" echoed Damon Hanson, a second year forward for the Maulers out of Renton, Washington. \"I mean they come support us every night win or loss. I mean, it's awesome.\"Adding excitement to the season is the fact that the Western States Hockey League has now moved up from Tier III to Tier II. That means more out of the country players are allowed on the roster, the season is a little longer and the talent level will be even better.\"Along with getting better hockey, it's better opportunities for the kids,\" said Baxter.\"It's crazy, there's a lot of guys with high talent and it's fun to play in,\" said Hanson. \"It's fun to be a part of and I'm glad I came here.\"The Maulers' next game will be at home in Missoula on Friday, Oct. 9 against the Whitefish Wolverines.
