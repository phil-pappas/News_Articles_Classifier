That means only an arrest, not a conviction, would appear on his record, Vargas said.\nWheelock, 55, retired May 8 after being charged with two counts of misdemeanor domestic battery for an incident stemming from a May 4 altercation with someone at his home in the 21000 block of West Highland Drive in an unincorporated area near Lake Zurich.\nWheelock's attorney, Christina Ivashchenko, said the reference to drugs and alcohol in her client's supervision conditions are part of a court's order in cases such as this, and not specific to Wheelock's situation.\n\"He still maintains the original charge was without due cause, but he accepted the reduction as a way of compromising,\" Ivashchenko said. \"He hopes to put all this behind him.\"\nA Pioneer Press report in May found that Wheelock was to receive $105,000 in accrued time off, as well as an annual pension of at least $90,000, as part of his retirement package.\nSuburban Chicago arrest photos Open link At a Village Board meeting in 2014, Wheelock was honored for his 35 years of service to the Lake Zurich Fire Department.\nThe former chief was an active community member, and is the immediate past president of the Rotary Club of Lake Zurich .\nMount Prospect Fire Chief John Malcolm is due to take over as chief of the Lake Zurich Fire Department later this month.\ntshields@pioneerlocal.com\nTwitter @tshields19\n Lake Zurich", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5620089c/turbine/ct-lzc-fire-chief-wheelock-battery-tl-1022-20151015", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561e87c8/turbine/chi-suburban-chicago-arrest-photos", "http://clubrunner.ca/lakezurich/"], "published": "2015-10-15T22:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:19:34.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
