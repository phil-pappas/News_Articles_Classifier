(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) \nCHICAGO (AP) — Dickson Chumba broke away from a three-man pack in the 23rd mile and easily outdistanced the field for his first Chicago Marathon title Sunday. \nThe 29-year-old Kenyan finished the 26.2-mile course in 2 hours, 9 minutes, 25 seconds, while fellow Kenyan Sammy Kitwara was 25 seconds back for his second consecutive runner-up finish in Chicago. \nSammy Ndungu completed Kenya’s podium sweep. \nFlorence Kiplagat won the women’s race in an unofficial 2:23:33. \nThe 28-year-old Kenyan, the half marathon world-record holder, pulled away late. Ethiopian Yebrgual Melese was second in an unofficial 2:23:43. \nThe men’s and women’s winners each won $100,000. \nSunday’s race was the first without pace-setters, which officials said would result in a more competitive but slower event with record-breaking performances less likely.
