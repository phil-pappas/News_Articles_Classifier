Lakers “ They tried to do some hula dancing. They followed the lead from a real dancer. It was pretty entertaining for all of us.”\nGordon Hayward\nHONOLULU — As part of a team-bonding experience at a Waikiki Beach resort Saturday night, Utah Jazz rookies were forced to attempt to dance the hula and to sing “Happy Birthday” to small forward Joe Ingles and assistant general manager Justin Zanik.\nIt’s a good thing Utah’s first-year players make a living playing basketball, not singing or dancing.\n“The singing was definitely not the best,” sixth-year Jazz player Gordon Hayward said. “But at least they got up there and did it, so kudos for that.”\nBy the way, don’t look for Trey Lyles, Raul Neto, Tibor Pleiss, J.J. O’Brien or Treveon Graham to be on a dancing show anytime soon.\n“They tried to do some hula dancing,” Hayward said, smiling. “They followed the lead from a real dancer. It was pretty entertaining for all of us.”\n“I turned my head,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder joked. “I’m more worried about them getting back in transition.”\nJokes aside, Snyder realizes that events like this can help build team chemistry off the court.\n“There are other things other than the game that can help the team,” Snyder said. “The time guys are spending together, it’s a slightly different environment obviously that sometimes changes interaction.  You learn about each other. There’s a comfort level. I’ve told them I want them to embrace it and to embrace the games as well.”\nThe Jazz also spent time with some of the team’s bigger sponsors. Many players, including Hayward, brought loved ones along for the six-day trip in paradise, too. The whole Jazz group gathered for Saturday’s beach luau.\n“It was good, a chance to relax a little bit,” Hayward said. “I think that’s part of the reason why you go on these trips is so you can experience these things along with playing basketball and getting better. That was fun.”\nMore fun for some than others, of course.\nSTARTING LINEUP: Snyder was reluctant to reveal his starters leading up to the Jazz’s first preseason game, but he ended up going with the expected first five of Trey Burke, Alec Burks, Gordon Hayward, Derrick Favors and Rudy Gobert.\nThat’s not to say this group is it for sure.\n“There are a lot of things that go into it. It’s not a clear-cut decision,” Snyder said moments before the Jazz played the Los Angeles Lakers at Stan Sheriff Center.\n“I wouldn’t anticipate that that’s anything that’s written in stone,\" he said. \"Competition is good. For us, we ‘ve got some depth and there’s going to be different lineups we’ll see.”\nNEW TWIN TOWERS?: Snyder chuckled when asked if he could envision a scenario in which he’d put 7-foot-1 Gobert on the court with 7-3 Tibor Pleiss.\n“Like the old (Ralph) Sampson and (Hakeem) Olajuwon?” he said, smiling. “Right now we’re super big vs. big big. We’d really be bucking the league at that point.”\nTranslation: Not likely. But at least he didn’t say no.\nINJURY REPORT: Small forward Chris Johnson worked out with coaches before Sunday’s game, but he still remains sidelined with a concussion. He must pass the NBA-mandated concussion test before being cleared to resume full basketball activities.\nEMAIL: jody@desnews.com\nTWITTER: DJJazzyJody", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:42:14.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
