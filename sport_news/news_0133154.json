This phase will connect two already finished parts of the trail: one from 18th Street to Silver Creek, and the other from the Sherman Minton Bridge to East 8th Street.\nThe City of New Albany is responsible for 20 percent, or $500,000, of the approximate $2.5 million it will cost to complete the third phase of the city's commitment. The other 80 percent will come from federal funds.\nThe red portion pictured above is the third part of New Albany's commitment to the Ohio River Greenway. Construction is expected to start in the spring. (Photo: Ohio River Greenway Project)\nâ€œWe are ever closer to the dream of connecting our local communities and riverfronts through the Ohio River Greenway Project,\" Mayor Jeff Gahan said in a news release.\nThe final part of the trail promised by the City of New Albany will run from the Sherman Minton Bridge to West 10th Street.\nAccording to the release, Clarksville is anticipated to start construction of a bridge to cross Silver Creek in the spring, which would connect New Albany's part of the trail to Clarksville's trail.\nSign up for the free CJ Indiana newsletter", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e8b6673d25a801f72b88e8ea91d5329a9cad8e97/c=207-149-742-551&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/13/Louisville/Louisville/635803436417114054-trail.PNG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/13/Louisville/Louisville/635803436417114054-trail.PNG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/26a663062eb756755f925584a84fbccc93aa4672/r=500x180/local/-/media/2015/10/13/Louisville/Louisville/635803436417114054-trail.PNG", "http://ohiorivergreenway.org/"], "published": "2015-10-14T02:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:06:37.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
