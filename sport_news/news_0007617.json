After three straight shutouts and a scoreless first quarter Saturday, Michigan's defense allowed a touchdown in each of the last three quarters to the Spartans. Michigan State passed for 328 yards, long and short. Facing talented receivers, the Wolverines saw catches made above their heads and had trouble adjusting.\n• The running game is far from dominant. While the Wolverines ran for 198 yards or more for five straight games, it was virtually shut down against MSU, finishing with 62 yards. While that was 4 more yards than MSU, when U-M needed an extra 2 yards to seal the game in the fourth quarter, they weren't there. Whether it's the line or the backs, it's a crucial element to win close games.\n• This isn't a championship-caliber team. Michigan's ability to dominate lesser foes is a step forward from the past few years. But when handling top-10 teams, as was necessary against Utah and Michigan State, the Wolverines were remarkably inconsistent. MSU was able to throw when the run was taken away. U-M, with 168 yards passing, doesn't have an alternative yet.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nSnyder: Plenty of blame to spread around for Michigan's stunning loss\nUp next for the Wolverines: Minnesota\nMatchup: No. 15 Michigan (5-2, 2-1 Big Ten) at Minnesota (4-3, 1-2).\nWhen: 8 p.m. Oct. 31.\nWhere: TCF Bank Stadium, Minneapolis.\nTV/radio: TV TBA; WWJ-AM (950), WTKA-AM (1050).\nLine: No line.\nKnow the foe: Minnesota was expected to rise in the West Division and contend for the title after playing TCU close in the opener. But after three-point wins over Colorado State, Kent State and Ohio — not exactly Big Ten caliber — the Gophers have been run off the field by Northwestern and by sliding Nebraska this weekend. Their defense was the selling point all season, at least until allowing 464 yards and 48 points to the Cornhuskers.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nWindsor: Final crazy play shows strength of both MSU, U-M\nThree things to watch\n• Jabrill's jukes. Michigan's everyman, safety/kick returner Jabrill Peppers, made his offensive debut, and it was enough to rattle Michigan State into taking two time-outs before he took a snap. Though he had only two catches for 35 yards, on one he showed his speed and took U-M to the verge of a touchdown. It'll be intriguing to see whether his offensive role expands.\n• Secondary's surge. Michigan's much-praised secondary had issues against the Spartans, allowing 328 passing yards. Although 74 came on the pass to fullback Trevon Pendleton, that was a mistake by two secondary players. Not every quarterback will be Connor Cook, but all four of November's opponents (Rutgers, Indiana, Penn State and Ohio State) have flashes of potent passing.\n• Resiliency. How will Michigan respond to a week off and then a road game? Minnesota on Oct. 31 isn't a formidable challenge, but the Wolverines haven't dealt with an emotional blow like this all season.\nContact Mark Snyder at msnyder@freepress.com .
