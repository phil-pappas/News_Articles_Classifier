It rains. So because of the rain, we wanted to give everything we had in the run game.\"\nThat was great news for senior running back Abdullah Elailla.\n\"I love the rain,\" Elailla said. \"I have a lot of fun running in the rain and mud. It's my kind of weather. I just had to concentrate more on holding onto the ball.\"\nThe same could be said for senior quarterback Ryan Vander Werf.\n\"I wouldn't say the rain changed our game plan that much, but we decided to stick to the run game,\" Vander Werf said. \"We knew we had to try to keep two hands on the ball at all times.\"\nThe running back Elailla and signal caller Vander Werf were the two key reasons Hawthorne beat New Milford.\nElailla had 102 yards on 17 carries, scored one touchdown and added two PAT runs. Vander Werf ran for 71 yards on eight carries and had two touchdowns.\nThe victory enabled the Bears to improve to 3-1 overall, while the Knights fell to 2-2.\nAfter a scoreless first quarter, the Bears took control of the game by scoring two second-quarter touchdowns to take a 13-0 lead into halftime. Elailla got the Bears on the board with a 15-yard run. Vander Werf then added a 2-yard run for a score right before the break.\nThen, the Bears put the clamps down on the Knights in the opening drive of the second half. Vander Werf completed two passes, one to Elailla, then took a quarterback draw in from 27 yards out, pushing the lead to 21-0 after Elailla added the two-point PAT on a run.\nMichael Dietrich paced a stingy Hawthorne defense by making 15 tackles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:33:35.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
