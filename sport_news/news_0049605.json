(Al Bellow | Getty Images) \nThe fight between Knicks head coach Derek Fisher and former teammate Matt Barnes reportedly started because Fisher was dating the forward's estranged wife . \nAccording to a \"family member\" who spoke to TMZ , the melee ended when one of Barnes' children saw the fracas and \"begged the men to stop fighting.\" \nNBA: Michael Jordan ripped because kids are 'dying for [his] shoes' \nHere's what else reportedly happened during the brawl in L.A. over the weekend: \"Barnes was heated from the moment he walked in the door and saw his former Lakers teammate in the home. We're told Barnes berated Fisher for dating his estranged wife Gloria Govan -- saying he felt disrespected because they've been good friends for years. The witness says Barnes made it clear he felt betrayed by Fish. \"Fisher stood up to Barnes and an argument broke out -- the witness tells us Barnes threw a punch that hit Derek square in the mouth. We're told Derek fought back and 'was holding his own' -- until several people, including Gloria, rushed in to try to break it up.\" \nThe pair were also both bleeding after the fight. A previous report said Govan is thinking about getting a restraining order against Barnes. \nFollow Charles Curtis on Twitter @charlescurtis82 .
