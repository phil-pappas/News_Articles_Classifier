They've relentlessly given impassioned speeches about police-civilian relations and implored their elected officials to do more.\nAs New Times has written before, the crux of their grievances is a demand for more body cameras and for greater police training — the Phoenix Police Department currently ranks third highest in the country for the number of civilians fatally shot by officers so far in 2015.\nWoods says she wouldn't be surprised if Councilman Sal DiCiccio was behind this proposal, since he and the activists have openly clashed in recent weeks about issues of police accountability and the city plan to hire more officers.\n“Maybe Sal and [others] are expecting a relentless onslaught of activists from here on out?” she suggests.\nBut DiCiccio says he didn't propose the rule and doesn't believe it's a direct response to the activists.\nMost of the time that members of the public come to a meeting to speak they do so for an agenda item, he says, not the public comment period. He and others on the council don't believe this will cause any sort of speech limitation — something he says he would never support.\n“If you looked back at the record, I was the one who [petitioned] for the public comment period to be at the beginning of meetings and to be broadcast [because] people have every right to complain and petition their government, and they shouldn't have to wait around until the end of the meeting,” he says, adding that he can't even remember an instance where public comments have exceeded 15 minutes at the end of the meeting.\nWoods counters DiCiccio's assertion by pointing out that following the fatal shooting of Rumain Brisbon last December, the public comment period went on for more than two hours.\nWhen asked about meetings like that, DiCiccio replies: “if there were 200 people in the room, they all have the right to speak, and I think some serious accommodations [to the 15-minute limit] would be made. It would surprise me [if this didn't happen].\n“But, then again, nothing surprises me about government anymore.”\n**Editor's Note: an earlier version of the this story said Phoenix would spend $1.6 million hiring new officers. The city will spend $16 million.\nContact: Miriam Wasser Phoenix New Times Get the This Week's Top Stories Newsletter Every week we collect the latest news, music and arts stories — along with film and food reviews and the best things to do this week — so that you’ll never miss Phoenix New Times' biggest stories.", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/phoenixnewtimes", "http://www.codepublishing.com/az/phoenix/frameless/index.pl?path=../html/Phoenix02/Phoenix0260.html#2-60", "http://www.twitter.com/phoenixnewtimes", "https://www.phoenix.gov/cityclerksite/City%20Council%20Meeting%20Files/9-30-15%20Addon%20Packet.pdf"], "published": "2015-09-30T23:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:59:27.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
