(John McDonnell/The Washington Post) \nThe Maryland men’s basketball roster has five players with established national profiles, a cast that has garnered numerous preseason awards and been mentioned as potential NBA players this time next season. Damonte Dodd is not one of them, but Maryland Coach Mark Turgeon believes that could change. \nDuring last week’s Big Ten media days , Turgeon not only noted that Dodd was one of the most improved players on his team but a legitimate candidate to with both the Big Ten and national defensive player of the year awards. It was high praise for Dodd, who arrived in College Park three years ago as a raw talent from Maryland’s Eastern Shore and has steadily positioned himself for a breakout season this winter. \n[ A slimmer Diamond Stone has the “furthest to come\" on defense ] \nTurgeon said earlier this week that he has eight starters on his team, a welcome dilemma that spells the depth of Maryland’s stacked roster. But his comments about Dodd further reinforce the role Turgeon expects the 6-foot-11 center to play within a crowded front court that includes blue-chip freshman Diamond Stone and emerging sophomore center Michal Cekovsky, who picked up more confidence during the late stages of last season . While Turgeon has not publicly determined which player will start at center to begin the year, Dodd appears to be the front-runner with the season opener against Mount Saint Mary’s less than a month away. \nThere is no denying his defensive capabilities. Dodd is the team’s foremost presence in the paint, a natural shot-blocker who can change and alter attempts with his length and athleticism. He averaged 1.5 blocks per game last season and improved his rebounding considerably, pulling down 3.8 boards per game. He had a number of promising moments that highlighted a bright future, including in a home win against Minnesota, when he had nine points, three blocks and 12 rebounds. \nBut Dodd also disappeared during long stretches of the season, struggling at times with foul trouble and confidence on offense. He said this week that he is more disciplined as he enters his third season with the program, fueled by the daily competition against the offensive talent of Stone and the physicality of Cekovsky. He’s also worked to hone his own offensive game, focusing on his left-handed jump-hook in particular. \n“If I know I can do that, it will just make the team better. But if I just do what I gotta do defensively, I know my offensive touches are going to come. I really don’t worry about offense. That’s really the last thing on my mind,” Dodd said. \nHow Turgeon balances his rotation at center will likely evolve after the season begins. While Stone has a rare offensive skill set for a freshman, he’s still developing on defense and adjusting to the speed of the college game. Dodd said he expects movement at the position, but unlike a year ago, when Maryland primarily leaned on Dez Wells and Jake Layman as offensive post players, Turgeon now has a full stable of options on the block with Dodd, Stone and Cekovsky playing alongside power forward Robert Carter Jr. \n“We can play so many different lineups,” Dodd said. “At the end of the day, we all just want to win.” Roman Stubbs covers the University of Maryland athletics for The Washington Post. sports Success!
