MSU hasn’t won at College Station, Texas since 1913. \nLast year, the Bulldogs upended the Aggies at Davis Wade Stadium, as part of a two-game sweep against top 10 opponents. The back-to-back wins against Auburn and Texas A&M, jolted Mississippi State to No. 1 in the country. \nThis year, No. 21 MSU enters the matchup with No. 14 Texas A&M already with one SEC loss. The Aggies are undefeated with wins over Arizona State and Arkansas. \nTwo losses in the first five games of the season would all but end the Bulldogs’ chances at an SEC West crown. A win at Kyle Field, would set up MSU nicely down the stretch. \n3 THINGS WE’RE TALKING ABOUT \nDak Attack \nDak Prescott has gained 673 total yards against Texas A&M in his career. Last year, the quarterback completed 20 of 26 passes for two touchdowns while running for 77 yards and three touchdowns. He also caught an 11-yard pass. \nPrescott didn’t play in the fourth quarter of his trip to Kyle Field in 2013 because of an elbow injury. He still totaled 303 yards and two touchdowns. \nThe fifth-year senior finished with 284 yards last week against Auburn to eclipse 1,000 total yards against Auburn in his career. \nThe time is now \nMississippi State has the fewest carries in the Southeastern Conference. Only Washington State has run the ball less than MSU within the Power 5 conferences. \nThe Bulldogs rank 12th in the league in yards per game, but average 5 yards per carry, which is the fifth-best in the SEC. The matchup with the Aggies provides an opportunity to pad those rushing stats. Texas A&M allows the second-most rushing yards of any SEC team. Ball State and Arkansas each ran for more than 230 yards. \nFinishing the fourth \nMississippi State is the only SEC West team to not have allowed a touchdown in the fourth quarter this season. The Bulldog have allowed six points in four fourth quarters this season. Only Missouri has allowed less with three points. \nOverall, MSU is outscoring its opponents 34-6 in the fourth quarter.

He also has four touchdowns and averages 18.4 yards per catch. UNIT THAT COULD GIVE MSU FITS \nTexas A&M quarterbacks: The Aggies have averaged 381 yards passing the last three seasons against the Bulldogs.
