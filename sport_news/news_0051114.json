It gave the Tigers complete control heading into the half. \nTop performer: Haaf had both goals to lead the Tigers into Thursday night's championship game. Both of them came in the final 10 minutes of the first half. Haaf took a pass from Kenneth Gawelko , turned around and drilled it into the net with 9:38 left before intermission. He then had an unassisted goal with 21 seconds left in the half to extend the lead to two goals. \nWhat it means : The Tigers will play second-seeded Moravian Academy in Thursday night's final. The second-seeded Lions beat Southern Lehigh 1-0 in the other semifinal. Northwestern (17-1) also avenged its only loss of the season, a 1-0 defeat to the Falcons on Oct. 1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:57:41.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
