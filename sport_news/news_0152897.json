Kids of film stars and famous sportspersons tend to carry the weight of expectations to match their parents' feat all their lives. For Anisha Padukone, it is twice as difficult.Her father Prakash Padukone is one of the greatest badminton players India has produced while big sister Deepika is one of the most sought-after actresses in the country today . However, that hasn't stopped the 24-year-old from chalking out a successful career in golf and establishing herself as one of the top female amateurs in the country . Recently in Noida to participate in the 15th leg of the Women's Professional Golf Tour, she spoke to us about golf in NCR, the importance of non-metros in its growth, and how she is Deepika's biggest critic.\nYou come from a family of high achievers. You must have had a fair share of people comparing you with your father and sister. How do you deal with that?\nComparisons and expectations are natural. The only thing you can do is look at it objectively . My sister is at a different stage in her career, while I'm just starting out; I'm still an amateur. The only thing I can focus on is trying to get better and play well.It's good that I have role models within the family but I don't try to emulate them. I'm just trying to excel in my own way .\nAt what age did you decide to get into sports?\nI was 10 when I knew that I wanted to take up a sport professionally. In fact, I shifted schools because my new school gave me more exposure to all kinds of sports. We had two hours of compulsory sports every day, which led me to dabble in at least 10-12 different sports. I ended up playing basketball at the state-level and cricket at national-level before I settled on golf. Of course, coming from a fam ily which has a sports background, it was much easier for me to adapt to different sports, more so because I always had my family's support.Golf came very naturally to me, so I decided to stick to it.\nYou have spent most of your life in Bengaluru, which is known as a big centre for golf. How is the scene different in the north?\nI feel golf is more popular in the north, particular ly in Delhi-NCR. You have more kids taking it up and the number of kids on the courses is higher than what it is down south. Parents here are also more supportive of their children when they take up the sport. Perhaps people in Bengaluru and Hy derabad are better spectators, but in terms of pro ducing talent, this region is far ahead.\nHow do you view the transition of golf from metros to smaller centres, like Noida?\nIt's definitely positive. Smaller centres will produce the future generations of golfers in the country because that way , we can tap into the talent pool at the grass root level and have greater penetration. What is important is that apart from good courses, there should be quality practice facilities.The courses in Noida and Gurgaon, for instance, have wonderful practice ranges, which is essential for a player to develop hisher game.\nWhat's your equation with Deepika like?\nWe have a five-year age gap, so she is both like a friend and a mother to me. She is very protective of me, like a typical big sister.Though we are close, we only get to meet once every two-three months because of our schedules and how much we travel. Though we don't discuss our work much, I'm a big critic when it comes to her films. I watch all of them and from her initial days, I would tell her what I liked and what I didn't. I would tell her, `You could have done this much better' or `I didn't really like that at all'. Of course, all this is from the point of view of an audience member, since I'm no expert on acting or cinema. However, I can be very critical and she always takes that very positively .\nFollow TOI Sports on Twitter >>> @TOISportsNews ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://twitter.com/TOISportsNews"], "published": "2015-09-08T19:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:40:04.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
