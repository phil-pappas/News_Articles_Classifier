But luck decided to play hide and seek with the Indian at the World Championships in Doha. \n\nShiva lost to Belarus' Dzmitry Asanau 0-3 on points. Shiva, who had won a bronze to become only the third Indian to make the podium at the mega event, missed a chance to qualify for the Rio Olympics. The six-member Indian contingent was participating under the AIBA flag because of derecognisation of the Indian federation. \n\nShiva and other Indian boxers will have a shot at Rio qualification at a continental tournament in China in March next year. \n\n\"The first two rounds were very close. Shiva had the edge and dominated but the result was not in our favour. Hard luck I would say. In my opinion, even Vikas should have won his quarters bout,\" chief coach GS Sandhu told TOI from Doha. \n\nFighting with an open guard, Shiva constantly invited his taller opponent who had a longer reach to step forward as the Indian ducked to attack from the inside. Shiva looked confident and almost certain to steal the second round being the more aggressive of the two boxers. But the judges scored in favor of the Belarus boxer after a close round. \n\nThe Asian Championship bronze medalist trued his best in the final round by making his opponent run from corner to corner but that was not enough. Vijender Singh (2009 Milan) and Vikas Krishan (2011 Baku) won a bronze each for India at the Worlds earlier.
