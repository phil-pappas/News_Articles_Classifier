I am doing my rehabilitation and it is progressing fine,\" Courtois said following Belgium's Euro 2016 qualifying win over Israel. \n\"I will be (now) starting the bulk of the work with my physio to come back as soon as possible. \n\"Of course I still have to be careful not to go too quickly, but all being well, I should be back in December.\" \nChelsea have struggled for consistency this season, with the defending Premier League champions 16th in the table, already some 10 points behind leaders Manchester City ahead of this weekend's home clash with Aston Villa. \nFull-back Ivanovic suffered a hamstring injury while on international duty with Serbia. \nThe defender has returned to London to be assessed, with some reports suggesting he could be out for around three weeks, which would see him miss the away Champions League tie at Dynamo Kiev as well as potentially fixtures against West Ham, Stoke and Liverpool.
