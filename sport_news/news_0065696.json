(AP) — A person with knowledge of the situation says the Arizona Cardinals have signed outside linebacker Dwight Freeney to a one-year contract. \nThe person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity on Monday because the signing had not yet been officially announced by the club. \nThe move comes after Cardinals’ top outside pass rusher, Alex Okafor, went down with a calf injury in Sunday’s 42-17 victory at Detroit. \nThe 35-year-old Freeney, a seven-time Pro Bowl player, has 111 ½ career sacks and led the NFL with 16 sacks in 2004. \nHis best years came with the Indianapolis Colts from 2002 through 2012. He was with the San Diego Chargers the past two seasons. \n___ \nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:41:02.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
