I was running around happy and just hyped overall. I was just happy and everybody came down congratulating me,\" said Smith. \nThe senior wideout knew going into the final drive, he wanted the football to win the game.\"Before they called the play I was telling [Gavin Nettles, Barbe's quarterback] if anything happens, just throw it at the highest point. That's a real good advantage on my part, just knowing I can go up and get the ball at any point in any game, and any situation.\" \nSmith did more than just score on the final whistle, his effort was felt throughout the game. The transfer receiver hauled in seven passes for 236 yards and four touchdowns, to cap off the best performances of his career. \n\"Once I got the ball the first time and got the touchdown I knew tonight's going to be a good night.\" Can't Find Something?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:45:28.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
