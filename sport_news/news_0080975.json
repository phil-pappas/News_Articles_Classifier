But it left the door open to his candidacy should the ban be lifted. The committee, without mentioning Platini by name, said candidates for the top job who are suspended were not eligible to run. But its statement said that should a ban expire or be lifted before the election, such candidates could be reinstated by the “Ad Hoc Electoral Commission.” Platini, the president of Europe’s governing body, was at one point considered the front-runner for the post. He was suspended for 90 days earlier this month amid a corruption investigation by the Swiss at the same time as the longtime president, Sepp Blatter. Both men have vigorously protested their innocence. FIFA also confirmed Tuesday that the election for a new president would take place Feb. 26, as scheduled.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:25:10.516+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
