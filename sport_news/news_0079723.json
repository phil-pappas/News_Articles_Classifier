I am not talking about safety but the lack of (political) progress, the lack of hope. Israeli politicians are becoming more and more extreme.\"\nAnother protester, who identified himself only as Zeev, 67, blamed the lack of a peace process for the current violence.\n\"It will further deteriorate if we think that being passive is the answer.\"\nDov Kredo, 60, who attended the peace rally where Rabin was killed, came from Galilee in northern Israel, and said he feels \"very pessimistic\" about the current situation.\n\"It is much easier for people to answer the call of fear and hatred,\" he said.\nRabin's killer, Yigal Amir, had hoped to derail the 1993 Oslo accords signed by Rabin and the Palestinians, a landmark agreement aimed at resolving the decades-old conflict. He is currently serving a life sentence.\nAccording to the Hebrew calendar the anniversary falls now, rather than in November.\nOn Sunday President Reuven Rivlin hosts a candle-lighting tribute in Rabin's memory and on Monday there will be a state memorial ceremony alongside his grave in the national cemetery on Jerusalem's Mount Herzl.\n\"The path that was stopped in 1995 is very much the path that needs to be taken today,\" Peace Now spokeswoman Anat Ben Nun told AFP.\nIsraeli-Palestinians tensions, always simmering, have surged recently in a wave of Palestinian protests against the Israeli occupation.\nSince the start of this month, 52 Palestinians and one Israeli Arab have been killed by Israeli troops or Jewish settlers in clashes.\nEight Israelis have died in attacks by Palestinians. One Israeli Jew and one Eritrean have been killed after being mistaken for attackers.\n\"What we see now is very much related to the path not taken since 1995,\" Ben Nun said, adding that Saturday night's protest was aimed at the policies of the incumbent right-wing government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\nThe most recent attempt to resolve the conflict collapsed in April 2014 amid bitter recriminations on both sides.\nIsrael has continued to build Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem despite the 1993 accords. Since 2006, despite pulling ground troops out of the Gaza Strip, Tel Aviv has been enforcing a siege on the densely populated and impoverished Palestinian territory, mixing it with three deadly air assaults in 2008, 2012 and 2014.\n*This story was edited by Ahram Online", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:46:11.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
