With a win, it could set up a key game between the two on Oct. 30. Canyon (2-5, 0-3) needs a victory to keep alive its postseason aspirations. \nNew Braunfels leads the all-time series 26-7 and is 7-3 in the last 10 meetings. The schools have split the last four games, with Canyon winning in 2011 and 2013 and New Braunfels in 2012 and 2014. \nUnder the radar games \nSam Houston at Harlandale: 7:30 p.m. Friday — The Hurricanes can lock up their second straight District 28-5A championship with a win on the road. \nHarlandale, however, could create a logjam at the top with a victory, which would be its first against Sam Houston in six meetings. \nWarren vs. Stevens: 7:30 p.m. Friday at Gustafson — The Falcons (6-1, 2-0) have a highly anticipated District 27-6A Zone A showdown next week against Brennan (5-2, 2-0) but must get past Warren (2-5, 1-1) first to make it happen. \nHistory says it won’t be easy — Warren leads the all-time series 6-3, with Stevens’ last two wins, 2010 and 2014, being by a combined six points. \nBy the numbers \n3: Brandeis’ winning streak against O’Connor going into Friday’s showdown for first place in District 27-6A Zone B at Farris Stadium. \nThe Broncos (4-3, 2-0) defeated O’Connor 42-3 a year ago, 12-10 on a field goal as time expired and 27-20 in 2012. They have won five of the seven meetings overall. O’Connor (5-2, 2-0) prevailed 35-0 in 2008 and 17-14 in 2011. \nBoth teams come into this encounter on four-game winning streaks. \n6: Times in the last 10 meetings that the outcome of the Churchill-Roosevelt game has been decided by seven points or less. \nThe teams have split those games, with Roosevelt winning in 2005 (18-17), 2007 (21-14), 2008 (52-7), 2009 (17-14) and 2012 (40-21). Churchill prevailed in 2006 (14-7), 2010 (17-14), 2011 (21-81), 2013 (49-7) and 2014 (38-7). \nThe teams meet at 7 p.m. Saturday at Comalander in a contest with postseason implications. \nChurchill (4-3, 1-2) and Roosevelt (3-4, 1-2) are tied for fifth place in District 26-6A, a half-game behind Lee (6-2, 2-2). It’s a logjam that could potential come down to positive points.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:52:35.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
