A few days later, Priore realized his text hadn't gone through. Driving home from practice, Priore called Bagnoli.\nAfter laughing about that, they hung up . . . over an hour later.\nThat's not the norm during the week two head coaches are facing each other, talking for 75 minutes three nights before the kickoff, but there was nothing completely normal about this week for these men.\n\"I knew today would be crazy,\" Priore said of the call. \"We got a chance to talk. . . . Talking about family, this and that.\"\nMore coverage Latest college sports videos SHOP: Collegiate Sportswear & Merchandise After Saturday's game, on the field, all Bagnoli could really say was what any losing coach tells the winning coach: \"Great job.\" The Quakers took care of Columbia, 42-7. There were a lot of mistakes made on Robert K. Kraft Field, almost all of them by the home team.\nEveryone could try to say this was just another game, but it wasn't. Not when Bagnoli had stood on the previous sideline for 23 seasons, with Priore at his side for every one of them.\nBagnoli helped orchestrate the hiring of Priore, timing his own retirement while former athletic director Steve Bilsky still was in charge. When Bagnoli then decided administrative work wasn't for him and took the Columbia offer - suggested by Villanova's coach, Andy Talley - some thought that wasn't so great for Priore, having his old boss just up I-95 as a real rival.\nIt's not really a problem - as long as Penn beats Columbia. Also, Priore quickly did something Bagnoli never managed in those 23 seasons, beating Villanova. That effectively started his own era as coach.\nThere is no question all sides are glad to be past this one.\n\"The emotions were - we're competitive people. We are,\" Priore said. \"I don't care if I'm playing Coach in basketball, he'd want to foul me, and I'd want to foul him. That's just who we are. We're competitive people. We've known each other for years.\"\nSaturday, they talked briefly outside the locker room and made sure they got together on the field for a pregame handshake and another brief chat.\n\"During the week, we didn't talk about Columbia more than the team,\" Priore said about speaking with his players. \"We didn't mention Coach's name.\"\n\"I looked over but never was weirded out or anything like that,\" said Quakers quarterback Alek Torgersen about his old coach on the other sideline.\n\"We really wanted to make a statement and show that we're together and really trust each other,\" said Quakers linebacker Tyler Drake, a captain.\nA concern, Priore said, was that Bagnoli and the former Penn guys on his staff really knew the Quakers. But with new offensive and defensive coordinators on the Penn sidelines the schemes are different, and Penn's players repeatedly talk about a new energy.\nStarting his news conference, Bagnoli said exactly what you'd expect him to say.\n\"We knew we'd have to play well,\" Bagnoli said. \"I didn't anticipate making the amount of mistakes we made.\"\nSix fumbles, two lost; two interceptions, one by each of his quarterbacks. The turnovers turned into points. A quick, early Columbia score turned into a distant memory.\n\"That's who we are,\" Priore said to his defense as it came off the field for the last time.\n\"It wasn't just your ordinary game,\" Bagnoli said later. \"You watch tape, you're not saying: 'Hey, look at No. 49 or look at No. 10 or look at No. 5.' You know their names. You know their stories, and you know their backgrounds and everything else.\"\nObviously, Bagnoli, starting a big rebuild up here, pointed out that he'd had a lot more time with those other guys \"in my other life\" than with his current guys. But when he talked \"us and them,\" there was no confusion about whom he was coaching.\nBagnoli said he joked with Priore about how many times they answered the same media questions about their matchup.\n\"I think you guys made this a lot bigger than it was,\" Bagnoli said.\nIt was what it was, causing attention to be paid to a game that would have otherwise been mostly ignored, two 1-3 teams facing off on a chilly afternoon in the Ivy League. It ended the same way the previous 18 Penn-Columbia games had ended.\nThe only difference was that the Columbia coach had been in charge at Penn for the previous 18.\nAnd his text congratulating Priore on beating Villanova had gotten through.\nmjensen@phillynews.com\n@jensenoffcampus", "external_links": ["http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=collegegearArticle&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2Fpages%2FCOLLEGE"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:45:33.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
