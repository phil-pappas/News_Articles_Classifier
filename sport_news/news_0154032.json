ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. – Rashad Jennings didn’t wait for anyone to tell him to score this time.\nWith the Giants again desperate to put the opposition away, clinging to yet another fourth-quarter lead, Jennings made sure they finished the Bills off for good.\nHis 51-yard catch-and-run from Eli Manning sealed Sunday’s 24-10 victory with an exclamation point before a crowd of 70,677 at Ralph Wilson Stadium.\nThe Giants (2-2) have now won two in a row and Manning threw three touchdowns to Jennings, Rueben Randle and Dwayne Harris.\nLeading 16-10 with 7:42 remaining, Jennings caught a swing pass from Manning and eluded Bills linebacker Nigel Bradham before highstepping away from linebacker Preston Brown along the Giants’ sideline.\nThe only defender between Jennings and the end zone was Bills safety Bacarri Rambo, and Jennings cleared him out of the way with a vicious stiff-arm that sent Rambo to the ground. Jennings raced the rest of the way.\nIn the season-opening loss against Dallas, the Giants settled for a field goal in controversial fashion when Manning told Jennings not to score at the goal line with a chance to put the game away. The Cowboys came back on the next possession and beat the Giants with seven seconds left on a touchdown pass.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T19:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:09:27.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
