Week 5 could reveal more about ACC teams \nPosted 12:47 p.m. today Your friends e-mail addresses (comma separated): * Subject: * You must enter the characters with black color that stand out from the other characters More on this Bozich: Is Louisville's next opponent the most faux 4-0 in the nation? Yes By Lauren Brownlow \nAfter four weeks of college football, I’m starting to get the sense that I don’t know if any team is good or bad anymore. The conversation part of college football is supposed to be fun. Instead, I find myself parsing the transitive property of various wins until my head feels like it might explode from the pressure of shoving it into that rabbit hole. \nIf NC State beats Louisville, it’ll be, 'Sure, nice win but Louisville wasn’t very good because they were 1-3.' (Although it was a very battle-tested 1-3 if there ever was one, and we’ll get to that later.) \nIf Clemson beats Notre Dame, it’ll be, 'Oh, they were at home and how good was Notre Dame anyway?' What’s Clemson’s best transitive win? I blame Virginia for causing me to misjudge Notre Dame seemingly every week this season, and frankly we can just blame Virginia for everything bad that happens in the conference. Like its poor record against the Power 5. \nOf the local teams, though, Duke proved itself last week against Georgia Tech. Now it’s NC State and UNC’s turn. We will find out about North Carolina – was the Week 1 face plant against South Carolina an anomaly, or are the Tar Heels ready to pounce on a wounded Georgia Tech team and get its first win in Atlanta since 1997? \nWe’ll find out about NC State, but we may find out more about Louisville, because if NC State destroys Louisville by less of a margin than Old Dominion then that’s at least one team that Louisville could potentially beat in the FBS – sadly, that team is not on Louisville’s schedule. (I kid, Louisville fans, and I do it because I love.) \nThe more games we play, the less we’ll have to rely on things like how good random Sun Belt team is compared to the lower-tier CUSA opponent another team destroyed and we’ll start to get a sense of how good all of these teams actually are. I can’t wait because it’s all giving me a headache. \nLOUISVILLE (1-3, 0-1 ACC) AT NC STATE (4-0) Time: 12:30 p.m. TV: ACC Network \n#ANALYSIS If you didn’t think NC State would be fired up….for some reason….WELL YOU’RE IN LUCK! THANKS, RICK BOZICH! Louisville’s favorite column writer has riled up the Wolfpack faithful by suggesting that NC State isn’t “battle tested.” He’s not wrong, people. NC State has won all of its battles handily against countries the size of Luxembourg and Guam. Louisville has been in battles with equal or superior foes, if you will, three times, and every battle the valiant Cardinals had their opponents on the ropes only to end in meek retreat after someone on Louisville’s side didn’t fire the cannon in time. Is that a dated reference? Whatever. \nI have no idea how good NC State is. They’ve looked very good. I also have no idea how good Louisville is, because they lost to a mediocre to bad Auburn team and gave it a valiant effort at home against Clemson (who is probably good?) but ultimately weren’t good enough to win it. They lost to Houston at home, which is embarrassing, but Houston is 3-0 so are they good or bad I don’t even know so you know what? LET’S JUST SETTLE THIS NONSENSE ON THE FIELD! \nTHIS GUY Lamar Jackson. Bobby Petrino’s wheel of QB destiny has stopped and it has settled on the freshman, who was named ACC Rookie of the Week after running for 184 yards and two touchdowns while passing for 212 yards against Samford. He’s been up and down this year, as freshmen tend to be, but Petrino maybe needs to just stick with one quarterback and see what happens. He’s going to make mistakes but he’s talented. \nHERE’S A GUY Kyle Bambard. Almost every facet of NC State’s offense and defense has been clicking in the Wolfpack’s first four games. Except the kicking game, which is something that was easy to take for granted when Kicklas Sade was at the helm last year. Bambard is 1-of-4 so far and has missed from 33, 48 and 41. It doesn’t feel too farfetched to say a game like this could include an NC State field goal attempt or two. \nNARRATIVES \nLouisville Win: You beat one of the only undefeated teams in the ACC after a 1-3 start of our own you are now the most ACC team ever congratulations \nLouisville Loss: Well…….bye, Louisville \nNC State Win: You see, NC State fans? You were optimistic about a game and it worked out just fine so there’s no such thing as a curse or NC State stuff or any of that and guess what….YOU ARE IN THE DRIVER’S SEAT IN THE ATLANTIC! \nNC State Loss: Why do you make it so hard to love you \nPREDICTION NC State, 32-18. There may be a scary moment or two, but they won’t last for long. \nBOSTON COLLEGE (3-1, 0-1 ACC) AT DUKE (3-1, 1-0 ACC) Time: 3:30 p.m. TV: RSN \n#ANALYSIS Turnovers. Maybe, Duke, don’t do that. Duke is one of just four ACC teams with a negative turnover margin on the season, and the other three are a combined 5-6 (Pitt, Wake and Virginia). Look, Boston College has an offense that is now missing its starting quarterback and starting tailback. And it was pedestrian before that. But the Eagles’ defense is legit. Duke is third in the ACC in tackles for loss allowed, and they allowed just two to Northwestern’s excellent defense, but Northwestern has 21 tackles for loss this season compared to 35 for Boston College. The Eagles also lead the ACC with 13 sacks. \nDuke’s line is very good, and Duke is committed to running the football, but the reason FSU didn’t run away with the game against Boston College last week is that the Eagles are stingy as heck on defense and won’t give up anything easy. Boston College’s defense has been great but has gained just five turnovers all season through four games. Duke can’t afford to give the Eagles a short field or a defensive touchdown. Commit to the ground game enough, figure out a way to maintain the ball and let that dominant Duke defense do its work against an offense that is…well, not good. \nTHIS GUY Troy Flutie. Yes, that Flutie. No pressure or anything, kid. He got his first extended action against Northern Illinois, completing 5-of-11 passes for 92 yards, one touchdown and one pick. He also ran for four yards on nine attempts. The Eagle line isn’t what it was a year ago and Flutie is going to have to have a great game to give his team any semblance of a chance. \nHERE’S A GUY When Duke lost Kelby Brown, it seemed like all was lost. But in came QB-turned-linebacker Tinashe Bere, who had 10 tackles against Georgia Tech and is fast, athletic and strong. He’s not a name you hear a lot with the likes of Jeremy Cash and veteran Dwayne Norman making plays for Duke this season, but his continued development is going to be big for this defense. \nNARRATIVES \nBoston College Win: Wait what \nBoston College Loss: No offense, Boston College. You can stay competitive this year but you’re just not going to be very good so \nDuke Win: Just imagine that I can reproduce any part of John Turturro’s monologue from The Big Lebowski here without bleeping every other word \nDuke Loss: You were running right along smoothly until… \nPREDICTION Duke, 22-6. This one will be…gross. \nNORTH CAROLINA (3-1) AT GEORGIA TECH (2-2, 0-1 ACC) Time: 3:30 p.m. TV: ESPNU \n#ANALYSIS As Duke showed last week, a good secondary and core of linebackers is often as important in defending Georgia Tech’s option attack as defensive line play. North Carolina has not defended the run very well at all, and that’s largely due to its personnel up front being…not great. But the defense is improved. Delaware gashed the Tar Heels for 279 yards and 5.69 per rush, pushing the Carolina front off the ball. Not what you want to see an FCS team do to your defense. North Carolina is allowing 5.03 yards per rush on the year and Delaware’s performance was the best against UNC all season. \nOne has to hope, if you’re a UNC fan, that it was a one-week anomaly. And Georgia Tech’s offense is bound to get some things figured out, even if some of their limitations – a new backfield and a new set of receivers – aren’t going to fix themselves right away. Georgia Tech has looked very average offensively against good defenses and very good to great against bad ones. Which one is North Carolina? We’ll find out a lot more about that on Saturday. \nTHIS GUY Mack Hollins. Marquise Williams was named the starter this week after Mitch Trubisky briefly took over for him against Delaware and found success – one of the reasons he found success was he found deep threat, big-play receiver Mack Hollins often. Before Trubisky entered the game, Hollins had four catches for 35 yards on 10 targets with a long of 14 yards. Trubisky targeted Hollins twice and he caught both for 33 and 64 yards. North Carolina has seven pass plays of 30 yards or more and four of them came in Trubisky’s time in the Delaware game alone, and two were Hollins touchdowns. They need that deep-play threat in all games and especially this one. \nHERE’S A GUY So….a Georgia Tech wide receiver. Anyone. There’s a common misconception that Georgia Tech has to have at least one elite wide receiver for its offense to work. It certainly doesn’t hurt, but what it really needs is wide receivers who are both at least a legit threat to catch a pass AND players who understand and can execute the offense. Georgia Tech lost its two best wide receivers last year and then lost Michael Summers, their most experienced one, against Notre Dame. Healthy Georgia Tech wide receivers currently have a combined eight catches this year (seven by one player, Ricky Jeune). But they’re not getting much on the perimeter either and that’s because the receiver blocking isn’t quite what it was a year ago either. \nNARRATIVES \nNorth Carolina Win: What’s that….is that a.,….Coastal…..a COASTAL CLUSTERING I HEAR? \nNorth Carolina Loss: North Carolina trying to reel in a big win usually goes like this \nGeorgia Tech Win: More alarming a real Paul Johnson smile after a win or this \nGeorgia Tech Loss: I never want to count Georgia Tech out but, well, RIP \nPREDICTION Georgia Tech, 29-20. Something weird always happens in this game. Somehow winning 29-20 might qualify. \n__ \nMIAMI (3-0) AT CINCINNATI (2-2) Time: 7:30 p.m. TV: ESPN \n#ANALYSIS No. I see your surprisingly good stats and overall pretty solid results this season so far, Miami. We are not going down this road again. I am not going to be fooled by you. I may, though, be fooled enough into thinking you’re competent enough to beat Cincinnati, especially since the Bearcats will be without quarterback Gunner Kiel. His replacement, as we’ll get into shortly, is not too shabby – he threw for 557 yards in the loss at Memphis after Kiel went out, and two members of the Miami secondary have to sit out a half for targeting – but I still don’t know if it’ll be enough to matter. \nNARRATIVES \nMiami Win: So you didn’t fail this week congrats \nMiami Loss: WATCH WHERE YOU’RE GOING MIAMI \nPREDICTION Miami, 58-32. The same score it would be if these two schools played basketball. \nSATURDAY \nPITTSBURGH (2-1) AT VIRGINIA TECH (2-2) Time: 12:00 p.m. TV: RSN \n#ANALYSIS It didn’t take long before Virginia Tech started giving everyone the sads again. They already lost their QB in Game 1, and now they’ll be missing cornerback Kendall Fuller for the rest of the year. Other than that, things are going great. Of course, Pitt knows a little bit about sads with the loss of James Conner and just their general Pitt-ness that leads them to fail in close games. I do not predict Virginia Tech games well in general, or Pitt games for that matter. But this tends to be the time of year that Virginia Tech’s defense starts to get it together (as banged up as it is), and Pitt’s offense has got to miss James Conner a bit more than it has so far at some point. \nNARRATIVES \nPittsburgh Win: Hey good for you Pitt \nPittsburgh Loss: Pitt football in one GIF \nVirginia Tech Win: You might have made fun of Virginia Tech last week but look who’s still in the driver’s seat in the Coastal, if there is such a thing \nVirginia Tech Loss: The timing just wasn’t right this year \nPREDICTION Virginia Tech, 27-23. I’m like 52% sure this is going to happen. \nNO. 11 FLORIDA STATE (3-0) AT WAKE FOREST (2-2, 0-1 ACC) Time: 3:30 p.m. TV: ESPN \n#ANALYSIS This is all you need to know about this game: we do ACC Survivor each week and this week came down to Boston College at Duke or Florida State at Wake Forest. I picked Duke. Florida State is still worlds better than Wake and has had a week to recover from its physical win over Boston College. But…well, weird things happen in Winston-Salem. And the Deacs showed a perky friskiness last week against Indiana. If Florida State thinks it can sleepwalk through a game like this and win it, well they would be sorely mistaken. And they need two halves of Everett Golson. \nNARRATIVES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:19:49.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
