We just really wanted to get it up into the offensive third so we can get our scoring opportunities.\" \nThe opportunities kept coming thanks to the play of Green and Fagan, midfielders who caused problems for the Rams (4-7, 3-7). Green finished with a goal and an assist, and Fagan scored the final two goals. \n\"It's good that towards the end of the season we are in this kind of form,\" Green said. \"If we can keep this going I think we will be in very good shape for the rest of the year.\" \nThat will be tested next Tuesday, when the Titans face C.B. East, the team which beat them 5-0 and caused their soul-searching. \nThat loss started the conversation between Brady and his captains. Then the gut check from the players. \nC.B. South is a different team now. \nAnd when the Titans step onto their home field to face the unbeaten Patriots, the Titans are hoping for a different result. \nPennridge 0 0 - 0 \nCentral Bucks South 1 2 - 3 \nGoals: CBS- Colin Fagan 2, Colin Green \nSaves: P- Brody Giblin 5; CBS- Matt Gorman 4.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:36:01.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
