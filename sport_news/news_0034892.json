Mets-Cubs is the best matchup we could have hoped for \nHarvey realizes the wisest move for his future would be to shut it down, call it a season, and be there for his teammates next year, and the year after, and the one after that, while still employed by the Mets. \nHarvey’s doctors recommended that he shouldn’t pitch more than 185 innings in his first season after undergoing reconstructive elbow surgery, and that he would be risking a second Tommy John surgery, which would be career suicide. \nAgent Scott Boras told him the same thing, over and over again, and certainly was willing to be the villain himself if Harvey stopped pitching. \nThe problem, everyone knows, is that Harvey simply can’t stop pitching. \nHe would be a pariah throughout baseball. \nHis teammates may never forgive him. The Mets’ fans would turn on him. His peers in the baseball fraternity would regard him with disdain. \nWhen he and Boras even brought up the possibly in September, Mets fans became unglued, and he was torched by the tabloids. He was called everything from a hypocrite to a traitor, with columnists demanding the Mets trade him during the winter. \n“I’ll be the last person to ever bring that one up again,’’ Harvey said. “I think everybody kind of had enough talk and discussion about that whole ordeal.’’ \nReally, it’s nobody’s fault what has happened. \nThe plan all along, talked about last November, and agreed to in spring training by Mets general manager Sandy Alderson, Harvey and agent Scott Boras, was that Harvey would have a 185-inning limit. \nNo one envisioned what would happen next. The Walkoff Podcast: Previewing the NLCS between the Cubs, Mets \nThe Mets got good, the Washington Nationals turned bad, and before anyone knew it, Mets won the NL East, reaching the postseason for the first time since 2006. \nSo they put those original plans were put in the shredder, and the revised version was to have Harvey pitch one game in the NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Harvey was good enough to beat the Dodgers 13-7, and three nights later, the Mets won Game 5, too, eliminating the Dodgers. \nNow, with 194 1/3 innings under his belt, the Mets are calling upon him again. This time, for Game 1. And, if needed, again for Game 5. \nAnd if the Mets knock off the Cubs in the NLCS, guess who’ll be asked to make at least two more starts in the World Series? \nThat just so happens to be Harvey, who would be the first known pitcher in baseball history to not having thrown a pitch in a single season after undergoing “Tommy John’’ surgery, to eclipsing 200 innings. \nAnd you wonder why he’s taken an insurance policy out on his arm, knowing that if something dramatically goes wrong, and he suffers a career-ending injury, he at least will have a few bucks in the bank account. \nThe Mets, of course, could stop him themselves, just like the Washington Nationals did three years ago with ace Stephen Strasburg, who was coming off Tommy John surgery. The Nats’ front office shut down Strasburg, who was 15-6 with a 3.16 ERA, after 160 innings in September. \nA month later, they were whisked out of the playoffs in the first round by the St. Louis Cardinals. \nNo one blamed Strasburg, because the Nationals didn’t give Strasburg a choice. \nThis decision, the Mets say, solely, belongs to Harvey.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:06:57.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
