Today's forecast calls for sunny skies, with an afternoon high of 70 degrees and zero percent chance of rain -- perfect racing weather. \nThe Bank of America 500 is the first of three races in the so-called Contender Round of the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup. \nTwelve drivers are still in Chase contention, including Joe Gibbs Racing teammates Matt Kenseth and Kyle Busch , who will start on the front row this afternoon. All four JGR drivers qualified in the top eight, and earlier this year, the team swept the NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race and the C0caCola 600 here. \nKevin Harvick , last week's winner, will roll off 11 th in his Stewart-Haas Racing Chevrolet. Harvick is also the defending winner of this race. \nIn his final race at Charlotte Motor Speedway, Jeff Gordon qualified 22 nd , worst of the 12 Chase drivers. \nAll 12 championship contenders come into today's race tied with 3,000 points. The winners of each of the next three races will each advance to the Eliminator Round of the Chase, along with the five other drivers highest in points.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:55:53.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
