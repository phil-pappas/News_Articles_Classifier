The latest proof of this addiction is the way the poster girl of Indian tennis and her doubles partner Martina Hingis annihilated the Chinese pair of Shilin Xu-Xiaodi You 6-3, 6-1 in just an hour and 12 minutes. This was the duo's fourth title of the year apart from two Grand Slam trophies, including the US Open a fortnight ago. Post the win, Sania got candid on ego clashes, skipping festivals for the game and most importantly, the social cause close to her heart.\nExcerpts:\nYou and Martina are on a roll together. Other than perfect understanding and complementing each other's game, what are the factors that work for you two?\nObviously, our complementing games comprise the biggest reason for doing well. But as partners, we need to trust each other completely and this trust is what keeps us afloat in critical moments. Apart from this, Martina and I love the challenge of handling pressure and this is a very important reason for us doing well together.\nUsually, partnerships tend to get little tilted over a period of time, with one player getting a little more vocal or domineering off the court. How do you two manage to steer clear of this ego clash zone?\nI think Martina and I are both mature enough to avoid these childish follies and ego trips.\nYou are involved with a lot of social causes. What is that one thing as that you really want to change in the society?\nI am part of a team that helps diagnose and treat kids under 12 years of age, who suffer from a specific kind of heart disease. As we celebrate the World Heart Day on September 29, I dream of the day when every Indian man, woman and child will come under the umbrella of medical treatment.\nYou have been a very busy girl, playing back-to-back and winning. Any silent musings about taking one luxurious break quickly along with family?\nTennis is a very demanding sport and to stay on top, one has to perform week after week. It is not possible to take a break in the middle of the season.\nEid and Ganeshotsav have just passed by and you were busy playing. Does it make you little wistful at times that you are mostly playing away from home at the time of all the major festivals?\nMissing festivals and celebrations is just one of the sacrifices that one has to make as a professional player. There's no escaping it!
