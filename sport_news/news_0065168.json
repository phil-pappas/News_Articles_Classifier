My style of fighting is that I take calculated risks where I don't take any injuries. \n\"I am very confident that I will come out of the King of the Ring unscathed go into the Super 8 easy as.\" \nIf he was to claim both titles, he would have to win five fights - three in the King of the Ring and two in the Super 8. \nBryant was looking forward to getting back in the ring with the man who beat him in the Super 8 in March. \nThe 35-year-old five-time New Zealand amateur champion put that loss down to fatigue. \nBut he believed that was an issue that would more likely be bothering his opponent this time. \n\"I will be watching him fighting the kickboxing match,\" he said. \n\"No one is Superman are they? If the draw goes right, he will be fighting four fights before he gets into the ring with me.\" \n\"It is just using the top couple of inches. He is an athlete, but when some one brings him down, he'll come back down to earth.\" \nAt 181cm, Bryant is 10cm shorter than Adesanya. \nHe said he has focused his training on fighting taller boxers. \nBut Adesanya believed his older competitor would struggle to keep up with him. \n\"I have already seen Lance, I have felt his movements,\" he said. \n\"He was a solid competitor and I sure he will have improved. But he has got to realise that I have improved ten-fold as well.\" \nJoining the duo in the tournament is fellow kickboxer Zane Hopman. \nThe 25-year-old was a sparring partner of Bryant's before he signed up for the fight. \nHe said Bryant was a \"stand and bang kind of man\". \nHe was most looking forward to getting into the ring with Adesanya. \nThe fourth fighter is 33-year-old former New Zealand amateur champion Jamie Porter. \nAdesanya did not believe any of the other boxers would cause him any issues. \n\"I would not be in the fight if I did not know I was going to win,\" he said. \n\"Christmas is coming up. I need that bonus money for Christmas shopping.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:09:47.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
