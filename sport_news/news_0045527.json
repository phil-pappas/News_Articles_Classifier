We did considerably better.” Cape Elizabeth won the championship with a 322, beating Old Town by 12 strokes. “Everybody in the state predicted it (Cape winning),” Freeman said. “What people were surprised with was how close Old Town was. Any team to come within 20 strokes would have been a surprise. Cape was by far the best team in Class B this year. They were solid one through 12. They deserved it. It was good to see them win it.” Maine Central Institute was third with a 347, while Mount Desert Island (350) was fourth, and Gardiner (352) was fifth. Fryeburg Academy (356), Erskine Academy (363), York (364), Hermon (365), Mount View (380) and Lake Region (386) placed sixth through 11th, respectively. Fryeburg Academy’s Jay Lowe was the individual medalist on the day, shooting a 73. Senior Colby Todd shot an 83 for York’s lowest score. “He (Todd) did a great job of managing the course and not taking unnecessary risks,” Freeman said. “He played smart.” Nate Kaye (85), Matt Ford (94), Justin O’Donnell (102) and Forrest Kelley (113) rounded out the York scoring. “Both Colby and Nate shot significantly better than they did last year,” Freeman said. “(Kaye) had a great round going, but a couple of holes got the best of him. He was hitting the ball well and putting the ball well, but then some circumstances came up when he was in the wrong place at the wrong time.” Freeman was impressed with the round by Ford, a late addition to the York roster for Saturday's tournament. “He (Ford) did what he hoped he would do, shooting below 100,” Freeman said. “He stepped up and did well, everything was working for him. He had a steady pace for the whole round. There was nothing extraordinary good or bad, he just played consistent, which was good to see. It was fun to watch.” The season is over for the Wildcats, sans Todd, who will compete in Saturday’s individual championship at Natanis. “His (Todd) goal is shoot below 80. If he does that, that would be absolutely fantastic,” Freeman said. “He would be thrilled. That score is something he set as a goal and wants to do it, and he’s capable of doing it. Things have to come together for him. He had a great round this past Saturday and he got stuck on a couple of holes. He was on pace to shoot under 80. The Wildcats return everybody expect Todd next season. Kaye will be a senior, while Tommy Carr will be a junior and Chris Cummins and Jared Heyland both will be sophomores “You can’t replace Colby Todd,” Freeman said. “He’s been with us for four years and has done a lot. But we have four kids coming back who played a lot of matches this season, and Jared and Chris also got into some matches and have some experience under their belts. We should be in pretty good shape next fall. I am pretty excited.” By Jay Pinsonnault", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:12:52.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
