Things are so bad CBS' Ryan Wilson had to go out and rank the backup quarterbacks .\nTony Romo is hurt, Ben Roethlisberger is down. Jay Cutler is MIA. It's ugly out for there for QBs. And you'll notice a trend: most of the teams with the top Super Bowl odds have healthy quarterbacks. \n1. Packers (5-2, previously 3-1) : You'd think after Aaron Rodgers put up a negative grade on Monday Night Football the price might get a little bit better.\n2. Patriots (4-1, previously 5-1) : The evisceration tour continues. Tom Brady and the Patriots are about to put up a 50 burger on the bye week. \n3. Seahawks (7-1, previously 8-1) : Woah, woah, woah. You're telling me the Seahawks aren't going to lose every single game this year? No way. \n4. Broncos (10-1, previously 9-1) : Peyton Manning is BACK. Or something. The offensive stye blend -- primarily using the pistol formation -- employed by the Broncos was a nice compromise. \n5. Cardinals (10-1, previously 14-1) : This is a legitimately top-shelf team . \n6. Bengals (14-1, previously 25-1) : Hope you're prepared for an entire offseason of IS ANDY DALTON AN ELITE QUARTERBACK chatter. \n7. Eagles (18-1, previously 20-1) : Philly can right the ship over the next two weeks but Chip Kelly's got to roll into Washington and dominate both lines of scrimmage to renew faith.\n8. Falcons (20-1, previously 20-1) : Call it a comeback, kid. Three wins involving fourth-quarter comebacks is how you end up not moving up.\n9. Colts (20-1, previously 16-1) : On the other hand, a win isn't always a win . The Colts had to beat the Titans or else Charles Pagano was facing serious questions. But they looked bad doing it and everyone's wondering if Andrew Luck is hurt. Little early for all that.\n10. Panthers (25-1, previously 20-1) : Same thing here. Sometimes barely beating Luke McCown is worse than not beating Luke McCown at all. Or something.\n\nIs it time to jump on the Panthers' bandwagon? (USATSI) \n\n11. Cowboys (30-1, previously 20-1) : Brandon Weeden managed to snap his record-breaking streak of completions by throwing one of the worst 15 interceptions of his career. Or thereabouts. This loss wasn't on him though. \n12. Steelers (30-1, previously 20-1) : Kind of figured Ben Roethlisberger would be worth more than this. \n13. Vikings (30-1, previously 30-1) : Still not entirely sure what to make of Minnesota, but Adrian Peterson announced his return. If you had to pick one human being to not tackle it's either him or Marshawn Lynch . \n14. Bills (30-1, previously 40-1) : Statement divisional road win for Rex Ryan. “ Tyrod Taylor is for real” still doesn't pass the Say It Out Loud Test.\n15. Dolphins (40-1, previously 25-1) : Annual “should Miami just leave Joe Philbin in London” kicked off Monday! It's a rich man's version of Biker Week.\n16. Chiefs (40-1, previously 25-1) : Coincidentally 40 yards is 7 yards more than Alex Smith can throw the ball. \n17. Giants (50-1, previously 80-1) : This is the whole “could be 3-0” thing in play for a team in a bad division. Five very winnable games coming up. Win them.\n18. Jets (50-1, previously 30-1) : Midnight and October are beating down the door and Ryan Fitzpatrick is about to turn into a helium-filled pumpkin.\n19. Ravens (50-1, previously 30-1) : Only five teams have made the playoffs after starting 0-3 ever. \n20. Raiders (60-1, previously 100-1) : The Raiders are building something in Oakland . No sarcasm. Except for the Oakland part. \n21. Chargers (60-1, previously 40-1) : What … was that? \n22. Texans (80-1, previously 80-1) : Without a quarterback and Arian Foster , every win is going to be an ugly grind-it-out session.\n23. Lions (100-1, previously 60-1) : Not even really sure how they're so bad. But they're bad. \n24. Titans (100-1, previously 200-1) : Marcus Mariota looks like the right pick at No. 2.\n25. Rams (100-1, previously 50-1) : If you don't know that feeling about making a last-minute move to plug Nick Foles in as your starter in a FanDuel lineup I would suggest never doing anything to open yourself up to experiencing that feeling. \n26. Redskins (200-1, previously 100-1) : Reality check on Thursday against the Giants, but don't rule them out continuing to cause problems. Next four weeks are interesting for this team. \n27. Saints (200-1, previously 80-1) : Luke McCown! Brandon Weeden! I've been waiting all day for Sunday night!\n28. Buccaneers (300-1, previously 100-1) : They just can't protect Jameis Winston . He can be a good quarterback but not as a rookie without protection.\n29. Browns (300-1, previously 300-1) : Start Johnny Manziel already.\n30. Jaguars (300-1, previously 300-1) : There is nothing as depressing in football as having a 50-burger hung on you.\n31. 49ers (300-1, previously 100-1) : Probably the worst game Colin Kaepernick 's ever played. \n32. Bears (1000-1, previously 300-1) : Punted 10 times. On 10 possessions. Promptly started trading defensive players. Humiliating loss. \nTopics: Aaron Rodgers , Adrian Peterson , Alex Smith , Andrew Luck , Arian Foster , Ben Roethlisberger , Brandon Weeden , Colin Kaepernick , Jameis Winston , Jay Cutler , Johnny Manziel , Luke McCown , Marcus Mariota , Marshawn Lynch , Nick Foles , Peyton Manning , Ryan Fitzpatrick , Tom Brady , Tyrod Taylor , Super Bowl , Super Bowl 50 , Super Bowl Odds , Arizona Cardinals , Atlanta Falcons , Baltimore Ravens , Buffalo Bills , Carolina Panthers , Chicago Bears , Cincinnati Bengals , Cleveland Browns , Dallas Cowboys , Denver Broncos , Detroit Lions , Green Bay Packers , Houston Texans , Indianapolis Colts , Jacksonville Jaguars , Kansas City Chiefs , Miami Dolphins , Minnesota Vikings , New England Patriots , New Orleans Saints , New York Giants , New York Jets , Oakland Raiders , Philadelphia Eagles , Pittsburgh Steelers , San Diego Chargers , San Francisco 49ers , Seattle Seahawks , St. Louis Rams , Tampa Bay Buccaneers , Tennessee Titans , Washington Redskins , NFL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:31:25.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
