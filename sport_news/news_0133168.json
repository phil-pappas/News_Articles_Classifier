Toan gave $250,000 — the minimum to get on the Times list that was published Sunday— on June 15 to a super PAC supporting Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n“Not since before Watergate have so few people and businesses provided so much early money in a campaign, most of it through channels legalized by the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision five years ag,” the Times reported.\nToan gave $500,000 to the same super PAC, Priorities Action USA, for the 2012 campaign season, in which Priorities Action was supporting Barrack Obama.\nToan was president and CEO of St. Louis-based Express Scripts, a pharmacy-benefits management company, from 1989 until his retirement in 2005, and he serves on the board of bio-tech firm Sigma-Aldrich. He and his wife, Polly O’Brien, who worked in the administration of President Jimmy Carter, have lived in Santa Fe since 2008.\nThey are regular contributors to liberal causes and Democratic candidates in New Mexico and nationally.
