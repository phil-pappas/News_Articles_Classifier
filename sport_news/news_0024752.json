By Seattle Times staff The Associated Press \nSANDY, Utah – The United States is in danger of missing its second straight men’s Olympic soccer tournament. \nAlberth Elis scored in the 24th and 77th minutes, and Honduras beat the U.S. team 2-0 Saturday to qualify for next year’s Rio de Janeiro Games in Brazil. \nTo reach the Olympics for the first time since 2008, the United States must beat Canada on Tuesday in the third-place match of North and Central American and Caribbean qualifying, then defeat Colombia in the CONCACAF-South America one-game playoff, to be held in Rio in March. \n“We have to win,” U.S. midfielder Wil Trapp said. “Plain and simple. That’s all it takes. There’s no other way. We can’t read into this result anymore. It’s over — disappointing as it was. We got to move forward.” Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. \nOlympic qualifying is limited to Under-23 teams, and the United States was eliminated four years ago in the group stage. Senior national-team coach Jurgen Klinsmann said failing to reach the 2012 London Olympics set back the careers of players in that age group, which included Brek Shea, Mix Diskerud and Bill Hamid. \nNow another age group could miss out on the Olympics. Among the American starters were New York Red Bulls defender Matt Miazga; Tottenham under-21 defender Cameron Carter-Vickers; Fulham midfielder Emerson Hyndman; Real Salt Lake midfielder Luis Gil; and Stanford forward Jordan Morris of Mercer Island, who already has scored for the U.S. senior national team. \n“We were not able to deal with the situation today,” U.S. coach Andi Herzog said. “It’s sad, but it’s the truth.” \nHerzog cannot be on the bench for Tuesday’s match after receiving a red card in the 81st minute from referee Jafeth Perea of Panama, who also gave a red to Honduras coach Carlos Tabora. \nElis put the Hondurans ahead when he lobbed the ball over two defenders and past goalkeeper Ethan Horvath. \nThe U.S. had two shots on goal in each half. \n“We had our plan, but we weren’t able to do it in the right way,” Herzog said. “That’s the most disappointing thing.” Note \n• Didier Drogba scored on a 30-yard free kick, Evan Bush made a late diving save and the Montreal Impact beat the host Colorado Rapids 1-0 in Major League Soccer. \nThe top six teams in each conference advance to the playoffs. Montreal is sixth in the East, four points ahead of Orlando City. Both teams have two matches left.
