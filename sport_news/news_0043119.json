A few suburbs have city council races, and there are a handful of proposed tax levies worthy of attention. But the important decisions are a year away, when Portland voters will get the rare convergence of mayoral, gubernatorial and presidential races in the same year – as well as tax measures with a much bigger price tag than anything on this fall's ballots.\nThe most interesting November ballot measure in the metro area comes from Troutdale, where voters will decide whether to approve a 3-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax. Members of the Portland City Council – who have discussed myriad ways to pay for street maintenance , including a gas tax – might want to pay attention to this vote. Certainly, Troutdale is a different and more conservative community than Portland, but failure of the proposed gas tax would qualify as a warning flare all the same. Last year, Washington County voters rejected a proposed vehicle registration fee. Another failed road-funding effort would send a signal about metro-area residents' appetite for increased taxes.\nOregonian editorials Editorials reflect the collective opinion of The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board, which operates independently of the newsroom.

The Troutdale proposal , to be phased in over three years, has a few things in its favor. First, the need is real. Federal and state fuel taxes no longer generate enough revenue to pay for preventive maintenance. But that is also true in Portland and Washington County. Voters deserve more than proof of a problem; they need to know that the proposed solution will work and is an efficient use of their money.\nGas taxes have some advantages over other road-funding mechanisms. They apply to most citizens, particularly in a suburb like Troutdale where it's hard to get around without a car. They also utilize a proven collection system, unlike fees based on miles driven. There is at least one drawback in a relatively small city like Troutdale: The tax could encourage some drivers to buy their fuel elsewhere, unless retailers absorb the cost. But the positives of this proposal outweigh the negatives, in part because city officials have pledged to provide an annual report to show the public how it spends the money -- projected to be $300,000 annually when the levy is fully phased in. By law, all the money must go toward street maintenance.\nThe Washington County Cooperative Library Services system is asking voters to replace an existing tax levy of 17 cents per $1,000 of assessed value with a more expensive one, 22 cents per $1,000. The increase is big enough for voters to justifiably ask questions, such as: Why does the levy need to be increased by almost 30 percent? And has the library system used the money it already has efficiently enough to earn voters trust?\nLibrary supporters have adequate answers to those questions. As to funding, the current levy covers only about one-third of expenses, with almost all of the rest coming from the county general fund. Increasing the levy reduces the pressure on the general fund. The money from the increased levy would also help pay for a new Aloha branch and expansions in Cornelius, Cedar Mill and Hillsboro, as well as enhanced children's reading services.\nAs to community trust, the library system is deeply ingrained in Washington County communities. The levy and county provide the majority of operating funds for 12 libraries. The cities, and in two cases nonprofit associations, provide the buildings and hire staffs. The arrangement keeps many decisions close to the community while allowing Washington County library director Eva Calcagno and her staff to focus on making sure the system operates effectively. Some of the larger libraries, such as Beaverton, with more than 900,000 visits a year, essentially function as community centers. Both Beaverton and Hillsboro make meeting space available to community groups.\nLibraries serve an essential role in a growing county that is attracting many young families and becoming increasingly diverse. The levy is for a reasonable amount and limited to five years, which ensures that system operators must continue to show voters that they are good stewards of tax dollars. It deserves support.\nThe other tax measure on the Washington County ballot is for public safety. It renews an existing levy of 42 cents per $1,000 and would provide continued funding for the district attorney's and sheriff's offices to use in addressing juvenile justice, mental health response and emergency shelters, among other services in both cities and unincorporated areas. The five-year levy is routine, would pay for essential operations and should be approved.\nOther measures on the Nov. 3 ballot in the three-county metro area are routine renewals and/or affect a relatively small number of voters. The big decisions will wait until next year.\n--The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board", "external_links": ["http://www.co.washington.or.us/Levies/PublicSafetyLevy/upload/2015_Public_Safety_Levy_Renewal_Ballot_Material.pdf", "http://www.ci.troutdale.or.us/water-streets/documents/smb/maintainandsave.pdf", "https://www.wccls.org/sites/default/files/uploads/WCCLSLevyProposalDocumentDraftBoC5-12-15.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-14T21:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:17:34.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
