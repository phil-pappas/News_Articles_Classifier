But will it be the savior the chain's restaurant operators and Wall Street analysts are hoping for?\nHere's a rundown of the major issues with all-day breakfast, and a look at what the company, restaurant operators, industry watchers and customers think so far:\nTiming\nMcDonald's started testing daylong breakfast in select U.S. markets in May and went all-in just five months later. That's a record pace for the world's largest burger chain.\n\"Our ability to move from one market in May to all 14,000 restaurants speaks to the commitment and alignment of franchisees and our entire system,\" CEO Steve Easterbrook said this week after the company reported improved third-quarter results.\nAnd it's a good sign that the company is running smoother under the top executive, who took the job in March, says Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy. The analyst notes that some items McDonald's has tested recently would be offered in a limited capacity for months or years, with a nationwide rollout to be delayed or canceled.\nMcDonald's restaurant operators say that all-day breakfast wasn't 100 percent smooth, though. Some franchisees say the introduction to all stores was too fast, causing confusion and slower order times. In a survey of McDonald's restaurant operators by Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski, some called it \"disorganized\" and \"rushed.\"\nEasterbrook said all-day breakfast is something that franchisees \"have been asking for years,\" but it will still take time to work out some hiccups. To prevent an overly complicated menu and overloaded workers, and to make room for breakfast items, McDonald's has removed some less-popular lunch and dinner options from its menu, like some McWraps.\nMenu\nMcDonald's removed seven items from the menu, on average, in an effort to smooth out everything from ingredient delivery to order times as it made breakfast items available all day. Easterbrook said there is at least another seven lower-selling items that are being phased out around the country now, and he notes there might be more to cut as more customization is offered, like through the custom burger plan \"Create Your Taste.\" McDonald's menu has swelled in recent years as it tried to introduce more items to boost sales. The company reported its first increase in quarterly sales at established restaurants in two years.\nSome customers are taking to social media to complain about not being able to buy their favorite breakfast items any time of the day. Some McDonald's operators are maintaining a limited menu of breakfast items to prevent complicating order processes, but the items left off can vary by restaurant.\nOverall though, the launch has been \"a lot smoother from an operational perspective that perhaps people had feared,\" Easterbrook said. \"The reality is the ingredients, the equipment, the training, the procedures is already very, very well established in the restaurants.\"\nSales\nSome franchisees reported that sales are being hurt as customers choose cheaper breakfast items for lunch and dinner instead of Big Macs or Quarter Pounders. Egg McMuffin sales have increased by \"double-digit\" percentages since the rollout, Easterbrook said. Sales of the classic breakfast menu item were also driven, he said, by a change back to its original recipe, which includes the use of butter instead of margarine.\nAnalyst Kalinowski noted that franchisees, on average, predict all-day breakfast will drive established-store sales by about 1.5 percent in the current quarter, and add about 1 percent in sales over the next 12 months. McDonald's sales at established stores rose by 0.9 percent in the third quarter. Established-store sales are a critical measure of restaurant health because they strip out any potential increase from new locations.\nThe move has been heralded by investors for its capacity to boost the company's bottom line. Easterbrook said it's still too early to tell how all-day breakfast is affecting overall sales, promising to give more information at the company's investor day next month.\n\"Clearly, we're playing to our strengths,\" he said. \"Breakfast has always been a historic strength, and we continue to do very well at breakfast, during breakfast, but now into other (parts of the day) as well.\"\nsbomkamp@tribpub.com\nTwitter @samwilltravel\n McDonald's Business", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562a9cd8/turbine/ct-mcdonalds-all-day-breakfast-1025-biz-20151023"], "published": "2015-10-23T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:09:05.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
