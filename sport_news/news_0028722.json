A school official told The Inquirer on Wednesday that a crowd estimated between 38,000 and 40,000 is expected.\nLast season, East Carolina was nationally ranked (No. 19 in the USA Today Coaches Poll and No. 21 by the AP). And on a dreary, rainy and cold Nov. 1 Saturday, Temple beat the Pirates, 20-10, before 22,130 at Lincoln Financial Field.\n Recruiting stands to benefit from the extensive publicity Temple has received since the AP Poll came out Sunday. But it also could light a fire under the Pirates.\nThe Owls admit that playing a nationally ranked team a year ago provided an extra source of inspiration.\n\"That was definitely motivation for us,\" Temple running back Jahad Thomas said about ECU's ranking a year ago. \"We were highly unfavored to win the game.\"\nThomas, who has rushed for 756 yards (5.2 avg.) and 10 touchdowns, understands the role reversals the teams face, with ECU looking to knock off a ranked team.\n\"We have a target on our back and everybody wants to knock us off,\" Thomas said. \"We have to continue our plan and be ourselves and I think we will be great.\"\nDespite the ranking and Temple's undefeated record, ECU is a three-point favorite.\nAll the talk about favorites and revenge won't mean as much as whether Temple can take care of the ball. The Owls only have a plus-one turnover margin, having caused 13 turnovers and committed 12.\nMost troubling to coach Matt Rhule has been Temple's penchant for putting the ball on the ground. The Owls lead the AAC with nine fumbles lost.\n\"If you don't win the turnover margin, you don't win the game,\" Rhule said.\nTwice this season Temple has lost the turnover battle. In a 25-23 win at Massachusetts, Temple committed three and caused two. In last week's win over UCF, the Owls committed four turnovers, compared to two for the Knights.\nEast Carolina is minus-4 (13-9) in turnover margin.\nTemple's defense is first in the AAC and eighth nationally in scoring defense, allowing 14.7 points per game.\n\"They make plays and are sound at every aspect,\" East Carolina coach Ruffin McNeill said of Temple's defense.\nmnarducci@phillynews.com\n@sjnard", "external_links": ["http://philly.stats.com/cfb/polls.asp", "http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=collegegearArticle&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2Fpages%2FCOLLEGE"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:33:17.351+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
