Two other misdemeanor domestic violence charges were dismissed. \nSapp also has to stay away from the victim, prosecutor Lisa Luzaich said. He faces six months in jail if he violates terms of the deal. \nSapp's attorney, Rich Tanasi, didn't immediately respond to messages. \nSapp was charged in June with arguing with the woman and pulling her arm or purse in an April incident at the M Resort in Henderson, and knocking the woman down a short time later at her Las Vegas condominium. \nThe woman told police she ended up on the floor and thought she may have suffered a concussion when Sapp stepped on the right side of her face. \nThe accusation came just months after Sapp was fired as an on-air analyst for the NFL Network after a Feb. 2 arrest in Phoenix for assaulting and soliciting a prostitute during Super Bowl weekend. \nHe pleaded guilty to both charges, and the solicitation charge was dropped after he completed a diversion program. \nSapp played in the NFL from 1995 to 2007, and filed for bankruptcy in 2012. \nHe was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2013. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:46:24.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
