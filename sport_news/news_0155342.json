I think it’s because we have that experience playing together,” said Bloome, who transferred to West Ranch (6-2 overall, 3-1 in Foothill) from Oaks Christian before this season, but played in several USTA tournaments with Waugh before school started. \nCho and Ozaki beat the Wildcats’ No. 3 team 6-0 and then played the match of the day in round three, a 7-6 (7-1) tie break win over West Ranch No. 2 Cori Raffish and Audrey Kim. \n“They are the best one-two punch in our league,” Saugus head coach Ken Jeffris said of West Ranch’s Nos. 1 and 2 doubles teams. \nWildcat Quinterra Walter-Eze swept three sets 6-0, 6-1, 6-0, while her teammates Yasmine Chinda and Emily Andrews won two sets each before being subbed out. \nSaugus is 6-5 overall and 1-3 in league. \nWest Ranch plays Golden Valley next Wednesday before hosting Valencia — which beat the Wildcats 13-5 to open the league season — next Thursday. \nValencia 14, Canyon 4 \nThe defending Foothill League champs kept rolling along on Thursday. \nThe Vikings (9-2, 4-0) won eight doubles sets and had their way in singles — except against Katrina DeGuzman. \nThe Canyon senior won her three sets 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 against a lineup consisting of some of the league’s best singles players: Kate Zeile, Amanda Tabanera and Jennifer Shin. \nValencia’s Lauren Wolf won three doubles sets, two with Gianna Benitez. While Lindsey Gollom and Ahanti Bommireddipalli won three sets 7-5, 6-0, 6-0. \nCanyon falls to 1-3 in league and 5-5 overall with the loss. \nHart 16, Golden Valley 2 \nIt was a good day all around for the Indians. \nHart (6-5, 3-1) swept in singles, led by Natalia Munoz’s three-set sweep. She didn’t drop a single game. \nTeammates Nicole Alvarez and Zobia Quaraishi both swept in singles, too. \nAs did Hart’s No. 1 doubles team of Cassidy Wilkinson and Abby Morris. They lost only one game. \nMonica Folgar and Marissa Wamboldt teamed up for three wins, as well. \nThe doubles team of Amber King and Giselle Zendejas and the pairing of Abigail Yang and Jzan Villanos each won a set for Golden Valley (1-9, 0-4).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:31:40.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
