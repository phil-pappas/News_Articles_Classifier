Now, midway through her senior season, it’s safe to assume all the Vikings opponents have a thorough scouting report on Roncoroni. \nRoncoroni’s latest gem occurred on Tuesday afternoon when she registered a hat trick in leading Voorhees to a 4-0 Skyland Conference cross-division victory over host Belvidere . \n“I think so far we’re having a great season,” Roncoroni said moments after the Vikings improved to 10-2. “I think we can really go far. This team is as good as any other team I’ve played on. We all practice hard and put in the extra time, which is good.” \nRELATED : Belvidere's Maddie Beaumont masters her crafts in field hockey and gymnastics \nRoncoroni has 31 goals and six assists this season. The second leading scorer on the team is Cori Lenzinger with six goals. \nTeams with just one prolific scorer aren’t always as proficient as Voorhees, which is ranked 12 th in the state by NJ.com. But Vidak says teammates like midfielders Hannah Schiavo and Isabelle Houser as well as defenders Sam Nicol and Hannah Parnham have fulfilled their roles for the benefit of the team. \n“(Roncoroni) gets a lot of really great support,” Vidak said. “We have great midfielders and a very strong defense, which has always been the Voorhees way. That’s always been our backbone.” \nRoncoroni owns almost all the school records and she scored her 100 th career goal in style, in a 7-0 win over Mount St. Mary on the Vikings’ Senior Night. \n“She makes it happen,” Vidak said. “She’s a scoring threat in so many different ways. She just connects.” \nRoncoroni got a big decision out of the way in preseason when she chose to continue her academic and field hockey career at American University in Washington, D.C. \n“That was important because I can just focus on the team now,” Roncoroni said. \n“I’m thrilled with her decision to go to American,” Vidak said. “That’s a big stress relief for her. There’s a lot of pressure that goes into making that decision. Now she’s kind of on a joy ride.” \nVoorhees led just 1-0 – on a goal by Roncoroni – at halftime of Tuesday’s game. Roncoroni and Lenzinger scored early in the second half as the Vikings began to seize control. Roncoroni added an insurance goal with 22:17 remaining. \n“In the second half we pushed ourselves to do better,” Roncoroni said. “We always have great halftime talks and our coach really pumped us up.” \nVidak, then known as Taylor Webb, was a star player at Voorhees in the early 2000s who’s had several of her school records shattered by Roncoroni. Nonetheless, Vidak has enjoyed every minute of the ride. \n“She’s done a great job,” Vidak said. “She definitely puts the work in during the offseason and practice. It’s not just a coincidence what she’s done. She brings a whole different skill set to the game, and it makes coaching a lot easier.” \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com .
