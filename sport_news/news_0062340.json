We want to get to 4-3. We just have to keep working hard.” \nAfter Bangor, the Pirates finish the regular season with games against winless Pen Argyl sandwiched in between contests against unbeaten Notre Dame and Saucon Valley . \nRELATED : Palisades QB Austin Krauss damages Wilson with his arms and legs \n“We’re fighting for postseason,” said sophomore running back Pat Lodwig , who had a 72-yard touchdown reception and ran 3 yards for another score. “We’re all making each other better. The JVs are making the varsity better. There’s competition all around. Everybody is doing a great job.” \nSophomore Matt McGrath rushed for 77 yards and a TD and also had an interception. \nFreshman backup quarterback Ethan Brader entered in the fourth quarter with the game in hand and contributed 53 yards rushing on 10 carries. \nPalisades coach Kevin Ronalds was pleased with his offensive line play of tackles Will Sadow and Ben Scoggin, guards Andrew Nickles and Max Allanson-Dundon, center Matt Barnhart and tight end Tyler Marsh, who laid out a vicious block to help free Lodwig on his touchdown reception. \n“We challenged them a little bit, and I thought they controlled the line of scrimmage really well,” Ronalds said. “They came through. There’s not a lot to be disappointed about.” \nThe guys up front helped spearhead a Palisades rushing attack that totaled 266 yards. The Pirates had 419 yards from scrimmage overall. \n“We came in and did what we needed to do, and I’m very happy about that,” Ronalds said. “It was a very workmanlike effort.” \n“We’re really coming together now,” Lodwig said. “Things are starting to click. We just need to keep playing like this the next couple weeks.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:27:02.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
