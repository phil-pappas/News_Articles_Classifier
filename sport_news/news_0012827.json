Officials with the St. Tammany Parish Sheriffâ€™s office says Hollis McCullen of Franklinton hooked up with several people Wednesday night at the fair for the purpose of arranging a drug deal. They apparently agreed to drive to a location on Ed Williams Road in northern St. Tammany to complete the drug transaction.\nDuring the encounter, which happened early on Thursday morning, the deal apparently went sour and one man was shot. Friends of the victim were able to get him to a hospital in Tangipahoa Parish where his condition is unknown.\nWitnesses provided conflicting information about the incident, but detectives say they were able to unravel their stories and tie the shooting into the drug deal that began at the parish fair. Investigators also were able to locate McCullen who was in hiding as well as his car that they believe was used in the shooting. McCullen is being held in Tangipahoa Parish as a fugitive. He'll be returned to St. Tammany Parish, where he'll be booked with one count of attempted murder and one count of attempted armed robbery.\nSt. Tammany Parish officials say more arrests may be forthcoming in this case.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
