Many pitched the same smart thought: Why not divert empty or underused land to urban farms? Let oases of fresh produce flourish in food deserts. Don't force local residents to trek miles for fresh kale or collards. Give high school and college students a glimpse of a calling — careers in farming or the food industry.\nWe've urged restaurants, grocery chains and City Hall to dip a shoulder and push this idea for a metropolis whose motto is Urbs in Horto : City in a Garden.\nOur conviction, and the theme of our latest Plan of Chicago installments, is: Chicago Can Do This. Chicago can scale up urban farming, reaping benefits for neighborhoods, residents and students. Those successes should also yield a potent harvest of how-to lessons that can cross-pollinate other fields, helping social entrepreneurs attack the Chicago region's bumper crop of challenges. (Sorry about all the agri-metaphors.)\nHow do we know urban farming can be scaled way up? Because we've recently spent time with Angela Mason, who leads the Windy City Harvest program for the Glencoe-based Chicago Botanic Garden.\nMason is a field marshal in a Mini Cooper S . She flits across a far-flung empire from North Chicago to Bronzeville and beyond — rooftop gardens at McCormick Place and the Hilton Chicago on South Michigan Avenue, indoor hydroponic and aquaponic operations at City Colleges' Arturo Velasquez Institute in Little Village, and farms in West Garfield Park, Washington Park, Austin and North Lawndale.\nMason and her Chicago Botanic Garden co-conspirators cultivated a thriving, kudzu-like program in just 12 years. Tendrils reach into foundations; local, state and federal government agencies; and employers who hire graduates from Windy City's apprenticeship and small-farm business incubator programs.\nct-edit-PLAN-PHOTO Anthony Souffle, Chicago Tribune Tony Davis tends to the plant beds Friday, Oct. 2, 2015 at the Chicago Botanic Garden's Windy City Harvest in Chicago.\nTony Davis tends to the plant beds Friday, Oct. 2, 2015 at the Chicago Botanic Garden's Windy City Harvest in Chicago.\n(Anthony Souffle, Chicago Tribune) How did she do it? Mason's mantra: Partnerships and persistence. You do the spade work to enlist those foundations, businesses, corporate sponsors and government officials to help you.\nMason describes the process of building Windy City as — what else? — organic. \"This grew from the needs of not just students, but ex-offenders, and the people in the community who needed something decent to eat,\" she says. They also needed jobs and reality checks. \"People romanticize farming. But it's hard work, dirty work.\" So is raising money and building networks of donors and partners.\nToday, scores of Windy City-trained students, graduates and entrepreneurs cater to some of Chicago's finest restaurants, supply farmers' markets and funnel produce to food service operators, government programs and grocery stores. Many former nonviolent offenders have found jobs and careers. Windy City grads work at Revolution Brewery, Whole Foods, Eately Chicago and many other gardening- and food-related businesses.\nRead the full Plan of Chicago here Open link Private and foundation donations and corporate sponsorships account for a third of the $1.7 million budget. The rest comes from produce sales, government grants, tours, courses and technical assistance contracts to local food producers.\nPartners beget more partners. The reason? Results. Almost all of those high-schoolers from Windy City go on to college. Many of the nonviolent offenders who graduate from the program go on to jobs. Success stories include Darius Jones, the 23-year-old manager of the McCormick Place rooftop garden, who recently spoke about urban agriculture and shared a Farm Aid stage with legends Willie Nelson and Dave Matthews. \"It's been a complete life changer for me,\" Jones tell us. \"I went from not working at all, not ever having a job, to managing over 60,000 pounds of produce a year.\"\nMason started small. In 2003, she recruited 13 Lake County teens and planted a 1 1/4-acre vegetable garden with $50,000 in federal seed money, thanks to U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. The first harvest: a measly 5 pounds of kohlrabi. Deer devoured everything else. Unfazed, Mason and her students erected fencing and planted again, eventually producing 500 pounds of vegetables that summer. \"I learned more that summer than I had my entire college career,\" she says. \"There was no way I was going to get that master's in landscape architecture or transfer to display gardens.\"\nKey lesson: Be persistent. Mason's conquest of the McCormick Place rooftop, for instance, took three years. How did she do it? Just a matter of \"finding the right person to talk to. ... I am very persistent.\" Cheshire-cat smile. \"We make sure people know we're here and what we want to do next.\"\nOne of those next projects is a \"Farm-acy\" with longtime partner Lawndale Christian Health Center. It'll be a soup to nuts food hub where commuters grab healthy snacks and residents train for food industry jobs. A 5,000-square-foot indoor greenhouse will allow year-round production. Lawndale Christian already hosts a farm stand and buys Windy City produce for its Green Tomato Cafe on-site.\nDeveloper Rich Sciortino of Northbrook-based Brinshore Development describes Mason as \"the steam that drives the engine.\" He approached the Botanic Garden and donated land for Windy City's 2-acre Legends farm at 4500 S. Federal St., on the former Robert Taylor public housing site. At Legends, apprentices, students and budding entrepreneurs hone their farming skills and raise crops for market. But the garden also provides \"a bit of tranquillity in a neighborhood that has been troubled,\" Sciortino says. \"It just feels like a moment of peace and security for the people who live there.\"\nWindy City has just over 8 acres under cultivation now, yielding about 120,000 pounds of produce this year. Why not 18? Or 80? Demand for Windy City's fresh produce briskly outstrips supply.\nThink of this as a shout out to all those potential Windy City partners still on the sidelines. Or to ... potential competitors? Mayor Rahm Emanuel just announced another trove of vacant lots to be sold for $1 each. They're not farm-ready, but could they be repurposed? We hope someone makes this idea sprout.\nThink of this, too, as a shoutout to Chicagoans who have other great ideas but who don't know how to make them come alive. You, too, can be outstanding in your field (again, sorry). Transfer Mason's lessons from her dream to yours.\nMore acres planted, more neighborhoods with easy access to fresh produce, more students educated and mentored, more graduates with food-related jobs. Windy City Harvest proves that Chicago's stubborn challenges can yield to partnerships and persistence. The ultimate harvest is a flourishing city in a garden.\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Editorials Opinion Chicago City Hall", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5617c5b4/turbine/ct-plan-chicago-windy-city-harvest-edit-1011-j-001", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56168d4f/turbine/ct-plan-chicago-windy-city-harvest-edit-1011-jm-20151009", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5555038d/turbine/ct-plan-of-chicago-story-link-20150514"], "published": "2015-10-09T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:46:14.084+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
