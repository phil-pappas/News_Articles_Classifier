Stanford plays all the teams in the North, plus USC and UCLA -- that's seven of its nine league games. \nThe other two games rotate among the Arizona and Mountain schools on a home-and-home basis. \nStanford played Utah and Arizona State in 2013-14. It faces Colorado and Arizona in 2015-16. (Cal is on the opposite schedule.) \n\"It's good, it's healthy, because the alternatives aren't good,\" Cardinal coach David Shaw said of the schedule rotation. \n\"The alternatives are not playing USC and UCLA every year, and that hasn't been acceptable to any of the four (California) schools. It's not acceptable to our administration, and it's not acceptable to our alumni. Advertisement \n\"Given that, this is best of both worlds.\" \nArizona quarterback Anu Solomon, who suffered a concussion in the loss to UCLA, is day-to-day. \n\"His status for the game is certainly in question,\" Wildcats coach Rich Rodriguez said. \"We will see how he responds every day. They will do tests every day.\" For more on college sports, see Jon Wilner's College Hotline at blogs.mercurynews.com/collegesports .
