He announced his nonprofit organization, The DeAngelo Williams Foundation, paid for 53 mammograms for women at hospitals in Charlotte, North Carolina and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 2014, Williams' mother, Sandra Hill, died after battling breast cancer at the age of 53. Williams led the push for NFL players to wear pink cleats in 2009 for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. \"My hair is pink, my heart is pink, and my toenails are pink,\" Williams said in a new NFL campaign video he posted on his Twitter page. \"Pink is not a color, it's a culture to me.\" This is dedicated to my mom, my aunts & women everywhere affected by Breast Cancer. I love you. #WeAreInThisTogether https://t.co/bAwaanlfzV â€” DeAngelo Williams (@DeAngeloRB) October 11, 2015 \nWilliams goes on to say, \"To all those survivors and the ones going through it, we love you. You are not alone. We will continue this fight against breast cancer.\" Copyright 2015 WMC Action News 5. All rights reserved.
