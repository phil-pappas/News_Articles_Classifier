(AP) â€” Arkansas coach Mike Anderson says he was \"blindsided\" by a tumultuous offseason for the Razorbacks, one that included the arrests of three players on allegations of using counterfeit money. \nStarting point guard Anton Beard, forward Jacorey Williams and transfer Dustin Thomas were arrested by Fayetteville police in July, accused of using counterfeit $20 bills and exchanging counterfeit $50 bills for $100 bills. \nWilliams was dismissed from the Arkansas program in August, while Beard and Thomas have been suspended from the team and remain in school awaiting trial. \nThe Razorbacks were 27-9 last season, reaching the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2008. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
