He, however, stressed that football was still the “beautiful game” and could not be destroyed by those running its governing body. “It’s a shame what is happening now but this is not football, this is some people who work within football,” said Pele who reached here after a three-day visit to Kolkata. “Of course, we are sorry about what happened now in Fifa.” The thrice World Cup winner did not name potential candidates to take over the world body, but added, “I want nice people, I want somebody who respects the people.” Asked about the corruption scandal that has led to suspensions of both Blatter and European governing body head Michel Platini, Pele said. “But, we cannot mix this (corruption scandal) with football. This is due to some people who administer football.” The bans on Blatter and Platini were announced by Fifa this month as its ethics watchdog ramps up its investigation into fraud and corruption at the heart of the organisation. “It is easy to criticise things and say that these things have been happening in Fifa. But you should not forget that because of the Fifa, if you see football today, it is the most popular sport in the world. “More and more people are playing football and the game is developing worldwide, be it in Asia, Africa, South America or anywhere. If you see in history, football has united people, and have saved people from drug abuse etc,” he said. sports football Pele Also Read WC 2015 India vs South Africa: Dhawanderful show Australian Ricciardo wins dramatic Hungarian Grand Prix Nine clubs face UEFA financial fair play sanctions Messi most popular among Indian women: Survey", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Pele_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151016/sports-football/article/football-needs-nice-clean-leaders-pele", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Pele_0_0_0_0_0_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-17T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:33:08.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
