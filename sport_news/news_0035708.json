(Courtesy of PAL)\nSouthwoods Masters leaned on Sofia Chabon, 14, and Missy Legaspi, 13, to finish the day with 278 points.\nChabon, who teed off in the back nine, bogeyed the first three holes, but settled down with three birdies against two more bogeys.\nLegaspi, younger sister of Southeast Asian Games player Miya, matched Chabon’s 52 with two birdies against four bogeys.\nSixteen-year-old Abby Arevalo, struggling off the tee, added 49 points on three birdies against six bogeys and a double bogey.\nRounding out the Masters’ scoring were Loralie Roberto 48, Kim Yong Mi 39 and Annika Guangko 38.\nSouthwoods captain Marie Claire Ong, who did not count with 30 points, said the course played very long.\n“The course condition was hard today,” she said.\nClaudine Garcia was the only other Masters player whose 34 was not counted.\nCCC leaned on Lois Kaye Go and Crystal Faith Neri to keep Masters within arm’s length with 276 points.\nGo, a 16-year-old graduating student of Centre for International Education, shot the day’s best score of even par 72, equivalent to 54 Molave points.\nGo, who is set to enter Boston College next year, played flawlessly in the last nine holes, adding two birdies to offset back-to-back bogeys from the 15th hole.\n“I played pretty solid today. I missed only five greens,” said Go.\nNeri, a new addition to CCC, fired two birdies against four bogeys and a double bogey for 50 points.\n“We’re very happy to hold Southwoods at bay. Frankly, we did not expect to stay in contention,” said CCC skipper Mary Kim Hong who contributed 48 points.\nExcept for Junia Gabasa, who struggled with 45 points, Hong said her teammates played according to expectations.\nOther CCC scorers were Riko Nagai 42 and Ryoko Nagai 35.
