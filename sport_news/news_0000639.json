After a tense US Open Cup final at PPL Park, the Union lost a second consecutive US Open Cup final, going down 7-6 on penalties to a Sporting Kansas City team who’ve rather made a business of their own of winning trophies on penalties. This was their third such win in four years, and while it never quite reached the epic heights of their 2013 MLS Cup victory it was every bit as tight – with Sporting again having to come from a goal down in the second half to force extra-time and then penalties.\nPhiladelphia had marketed this game with the hashtag #unfinishedbusiness after the disappointment of their loss to Seattle last year, but the opening exchanges were business as usual given the recent history of these two teams. Perhaps having been in this position before, Sporting started with an air of composure as they looked to pick their passes through the Philadelphia lines.\nThat said, from the moment Paulo Nagamura’s low drive across Andre Blake beat the keeper but rebounded back to him off the inside of the post in the 12th minute, Sporting’s play began to falter. Now it was the Union’s more direct play that was troubling the Sporting defense. The 5ft 9in central defender Kevin Ellis was singled out for balls over the top, and Philadelphia’s passes split the back line – especially on the left, where Seth Sinovic looked to be struggling to read the runs of Sebastien Le Toux.\nLe Toux is not the quickest player, but when he’s ably supported by other runners his cunning and timing causes problems – never more so than in the US Open Cup , where he came into the game as the all-time leading goalscorer, with 15. Make that 16, as in the 23rd minute he ran onto an exquisite raking pass from Vincent Nogueira and fired low across Tim Melia to give the Union the lead.\nFrom there, the Union’s confidence grew and Sporting’s composure diminished. Nogueira began looking for further killer passes, while at the other end there was little sign of Benny Feilhaber’s playmaking, as Dom Dwyer cut an increasingly frustrated figure in front of him. An unthreatening header from Kriztian Nemeth a minute before half-time was the sum total of their threat for the rest of the first period.\nWith the rain now sheeting across the field in the second half, Sporting still struggled to settle. It was hard to see where creative inspiration was going to come from for them as an increasingly confident Philadelphia harried them repeatedly in the early stages. Sporting did have the ball in the net after a goalmouth scramble in the 55th minute, but only through Chance Myers’ obvious foul on Andre Blake. Blake had got the start ahead of John McCarthy, who had performed heroics in each of the previous rounds, but as he lay on the turf recovering from Myers’ boot colliding with his head, Blake could have been forgiven for wishing Curtin had gone with McCarthy. As it was, McCarthy’s moment would come.\nA few minutes later it was Philadelphia’s turn to “score” as an offside Barnetta rounded Melia and slotted home. The flag had long gone up, but it was another smart flick from Le Toux to let him in, and another warning for Sporting.\nThey seemed to heed this one. In the 65th minute Myers roved forward down the right and touched the ball inside the box, where Graham Zusi got to it just before Michael Lahoud. His touch took the ball into the path of Nemeth in space on the left of the box. Nemeth still had plenty to do but curled a beautiful shot past Blake’s fingertips into the far corner to level the game.\nLe Toux may be the Open Cup specialist, but Nemeth has been no slouch in this year’s competition – this was the fourth consecutive game he had scored in this year’s tournament. And as the Hungarian resumed normal service so too did Sporting, who began to edge back with the sense of entitlement they’d started the game with. If their back four still looked shaky at times, their midfield was finally asserting more influence.\nBut Philadelphia still had their own sense of purpose, and with the substitutions starting to shape the game for possible extra-time, the introduction of the directness of Conor Casey, on for Maidana, tilted the game the Union’s way again. He’d barely entered the field in the when he was put through on goal. His resulting shot was tame and smothered by Melia, but his appearance had given the hosts a timely boost of self-belief as they tried to settle the game in regulation.\nSporting settled again though and were the harder pressing team as the 90 minutes ended. There was little to separate the teams in a tense opening period of extra-time though, and an increasingly slippy surface introduced a further element of hesitancy.\nThe second period of extra-time started with Myers picking up the 11th yellow of the game from a card-happy Ted Unkel. From the resulting free kick Edu found himself in acres of space on the right of the box, but after composing himself for the shot, drove it straight at Melia.\nAt the other end, Blake was forced into a save in the 114th minute, when Dwyer had time to turn in the box, but not enough to set his feet to get any power into his low shot. And other than a couple of Union corners that roused the crowd but came to nothing, that was that for open play.\nThere was final twist though. In a move reminiscent of Tim Krul’s infamous last minute substitution at last year’s World Cup, Jim Curtin introduced McCarthy, hero of two penalty shootouts in this Cup run, to face another one, in place of Blake. But McCarthy was given little chance to affect the outcome. In a shootout marked mostly by high quality penalties from both sides, McCarthy was only able to make one save, from Nemeth’s soft shot to the keeper’s right, with Sporting’s third kick.\nOther than that, the young Philadelphia keeper could only watch a series of firm shots fly past him, safely out of reach, until finally Jordi Quintilla put a low shot just to the right of the spot McCarthy had just dived away from, to end Union hopes.\nFor Sporting, this trophy consolidates the Peter Vermes era, even if at times some of the players that era was built on looked as if their time had passed.\nFor Philadelphia, yet another poor league season has gone by, without the consolation of the trophy that had seemed like a possibility in their otherwise uninspiring year. The Union have still to win a trophy in their short history.
