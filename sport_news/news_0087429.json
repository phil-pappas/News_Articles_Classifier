(Jae C. Hong / AP) Tribune wire reports Contact Reporter \nBen Zobrist's easy fly that somehow fell in for a hit began a five-run rally against David Price, and the Kansas City Royals rolled to a 6-3 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on Saturday for a 2-0 lead in the AL Championship Series. \nWade Davis survived a shaky ninth for Kansas City after Luke Hochevar and Danny Duffy were solid in relief of Yordano Ventura. Kelvin Herrera breezed through the eighth. \nDavis gave up a leadoff single and walked pinch-hitter Cliff Pennington, but bounced back to strike out leadoff man Ben Revere and MVP candidate Josh Donaldson. Jose Bautista then flied out to right to give Davis his third postseason save and the Royals another postseason comeback win. \nAssociated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:09:56.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
