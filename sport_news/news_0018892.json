By BRITTINI RAY\nG eorgia State Patrol is investigating a two-vehicle accident that sent a pickup, its driver and portable toilets into the Savannah River off the Interstate 95 bridge and left drivers stuck in traffic for hours Wednesday afternoon.\nGSP, the Effingham County Sheriff’s Office, Savannah-Chatham police, Rincon Fire and other local agencies responded to an accident at about 1 p.m. on the northbound lanes of I-95, where the driver of a vehicle carrying porta-potties was run off the bridge by a tractor-trailer near the South Carolina state line, according to Sgt. Chris Rodewolt of Georgia State Patrol.\nThe driver of the pickup was transported to the hospital with\n“visible, but not life-threatening” injuries after he was able to climb to the top of his vehicle and wait for rescue, Rodewolt said.\n“When I got to the scene, the driver of the truck was sitting on top of his truck,” he said. “He managed to pull himself out and was sitting on top trying to stay out of the water as much as possible. Port Wentworth Fire was able to get a line and life vest out to him and secure him before we got a boat out here.”\nThe tractor-trailer struck the pickup from behind, causing the vehicle to hit the guardrail and tumble off the bridge, Rodewolt said.\nInvestigators have not determined which driver was at fault.\n“We’re too early into the investigation to speculate about whose fault it was,” he said. “We did have several witnesses that were on the bridge at the time and they were able to provide a little insight about the chain of events that led to this crash so we’re going to look at every angle and continue with this investigation.”\nPolice and other rescue agencies shut down one northbound lane of I-95 for a few hours while Sapp’s Wrecker Service fished the truck and other floating debris out of the water. Rolls of toilet paper were seen floating by as Savannah-Chatham police assisted with the towing, searching for parts that sank underwater. The vehicle was recovered just before 3 p.m.\nThe lane closure caused slow traffic for hours backing traffic up to Jimmy DeLoach Parkway at exit 106. The bridge lane reopened around 4 p.m.\nThe investigation is ongoing, Rodewolt said.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14809442.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14809446.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14809444.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14809445.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14809443.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14809443.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14809445.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14804267.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14809444.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14804267.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14809446.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14809442.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T09:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:14:14.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
