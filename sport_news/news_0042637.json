This marks the third year the Delta Dental Foundation has partnered with TeamSmile to ensure children across Michigan have adequate access to dental care and oral health education.\nDuring the special dental clinic, 300 children from GEE White Academy in Detroit received critical dental services at no cost, including sealants, fillings, pulpotomies, extractions and routine cleanings.\nOne hundred dental professionals, dental students and volunteers provided the much-needed care and educated students about the importance of good oral health habits and their critical connection to overall health.\nIn addition to the clinic, Detroit Lions Head Coach Jim Caldwell and Detroit Lions players interacted with the students and discussed the importance of good oral health. The students were then sent home with special goody bags filled with toothbrushes, toothpaste and oral health information.\n“TeamSmile does a great job of helping students receive much needed dental care,” said Teri Battaglieri, director, Delta Dental Foundation. “With children missing 51 million hours of school each year because of oral health-related problems, partnering with TeamSmile is one of the many ways the Delta Dental Foundation is doing its part to ensure that Michigan’s children show up for school every day healthy, pain free and ready to learn.”\n“TeamSmile’s mission is help children get much needed dental care while educating them about the importance of taking care of their teeth. We are able to accomplish our mission with sponsorships from wonderful organization like Delta Dental. Partnering with an organization that also understands the importance of helping children get access to free dental care and education and how this impacts the child’s health into their future is a win-win for everyone.”\nOver the past three years, the Delta Dental Foundation has contributed $40,000 in funding for the TeamSmile dental clinics.\nAbout Delta Dental Foundation\nThe Delta Dental Foundation is a nonprofit, charitable organization established in 1980, which serves as the philanthropic arm of Delta Dental of Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and North Carolina.
