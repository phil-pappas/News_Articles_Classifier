The new wardrobe also includes a burgundy vest, burgundy sweater and burgundy coat.\nNYC Transit spokeswoman Deirdre Parker said the per-worker cost was approximately $738, and the total cost $2,583,245.\nSubway managers decided to \"provide a more professional and consistent look for all station agents,\" Parker said in a written response to questions.\nThe MTA board voted last week to increase fares and tolls. The third set of increases since 2003 is scheduled to go into effect in March.\nThe vote was the final act on the 2008 budget that started with the unveiling of a preliminary plan in July, followed by public hearings.\nToken booth clerk Norman Winston Pou couldn't believe the cost.\nSmith for News The new uniform \"That's absolutely outrageous,\" Pou said. \"They could improve facilities and job conditions with that money.\"\nAn internal August memo from the chief stations officer said all workers were to be in their new threads by Dec. 1.\nOne clerk, who declined to give his name for fear of being penalized, panned the new outfits.\n\"I feel like a busboy,\" he said, adding that white was a curious choice for the underground posts. \"It's a dirty environment. It's not an office, an open space, with a water cooler and all that. It's a train station.\"\nToken booth clerks seeking warmth are to wear their blue vests or sweaters when selling MetroCards, the clerk said.\nThe worker said NYC Transit periodically buys workers replacement uniforms, every two years or so, but the new gear came on an accelerated schedule.\npdonohue@nydailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:55:36.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
