Gov. Jerry Brown signed Assembly Bill 966 in 2014 that required the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to come up with a plan to implement a program to provide condoms to inmates in state prisons. While sexual activity among inmates is prohibited in California, it still happens, and the state wants to stem the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 7 people who pass through the correctional system each year have HIV. Starting in July, condoms were placed in dispensers at California State Prison, Corcoran, in Kings County, California Medical Facility in Vacaville, Mule Creek State Prison in Ione, and California State Prison San Quentin in Marin County. Over the next year or so, the rest of the prisons in the state will start dispensing condoms, including at Sierra Conservation Center, which should get them by April 2016, said Joe Orlando, CDCR spokesman in Sacramento. The dispensers and condoms will cost approximately $128,240 for initial purchase and implementation statewide to all prisons, which is about $1.17 per inmate. There are about 122,000 inmates in state prisons, Orlando said. Expenditures after the first year will vary, but the cost is approximately $138 per case of 1,008 condoms. From July 24 to Sept. 4, there were 1,500 condoms dispensed at Corcoran, 5,000 at California Medical Facility, 6,000 at Mule Creek and 8,600 at San Quentin. According to the Sept. 30 population report, Corcoran had 4,408 inmates, CMF had 2,584 inmates, Mule Creek had 2,899 inmates, and San Quentin had 3,347 inmates. Sierra Conservation Center had 4,354 inmates on Sept. 30. The cost to provide condoms is much less than the cost to treat inmates for sexually transmitted diseases like Hepatitis C and HIV, Orlando said. The cost to treat an inmate with Hep C is about $1,000 per day or $84,000 for a 12-week course of treatment, according to the CDCR. That cost does not include some patients who require longer courses of treatment, lab tests, imaging studies and staff time. The wholesale cost of HIV treatment regimens range in cost from $24,000 to $60,000 per person annually, not including lab tests and staff time, the CDCR said. The cost of giving inmates access to condoms for one year is less than treating two patients who have Hep C or three patients with HIV. “Health and safety-wise, it makes sense to be proactive than pay the thousands of dollars to treat sexually transmitted diseases,” Orlando said. “Let’s face it, these inmates will be going back into communities,” and condom use will cut down disease transmission, Orlando said. The program is not without detractors. The California Correctional Peace Officer Association said its members disagree with providing condoms to inmates for several reasons, including potential “gassing,” where body fluids or excrement is put in balloons and thrown at correctional officers. CDCR administration has regular meetings with the condom workshop group and, as of Thursday, there had been no reports of inmates using the condoms for anything other than the purpose of safe sex, Orlando said. “We absolutely support effort to reduce the spread of disease in prison, but safe sex for inmates means more risk for officers and more confusion over policy,” said Chuck Alexander, president of the CCPOA. “Under California law, sex between inmates is illegal, and condoms are technically contraband that should be confiscated, so the department is directing officers to violate their sworn oath to uphold the law.” The condom program will also make it harder to enforce the Prison Rape Elimination Act, Alexander said. “Prison rapists will be encouraged to simply flush evidence that could otherwise be used against them, putting victims in even greater jeopardy,” Alexander said. The Bureau of Justice Statistics said in 2011-12, an estimated 4 percent of state and federal prison inmates and 3.2 percent of jail inmates reported experiencing one or more incidents of sexual victimization by another inmate or facility staff in the preceding 12 months or since admission to the facility.
