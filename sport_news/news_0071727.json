McGee, a Miami product, was a fifth-round pick by the Rams in the 2013 NFL Draft. McGee has played in 17 regular season games in his career. \nHe played in 15 games in 2013, then missed most of last season with a foot injury. He was briefly on the Rams' active roster this season, as well as their practice squad. \nThe Giants needed to make a move at cornerback, where they have been hit hard with injuries over the past two weeks. Starting cornerback Prince Amukamara is out 2-4 weeks with a partially torn pectoral muscle , and slot cornerback Trumaine McBride has been limited by a groin injury, as well as illness. \nPLUS : JPP is on the way back to Giants soon for a check-up \nMcBride was listed as questionable for Monday night's game against the Eagles , leaving the Giants with just three healthy cornerbacks in Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, Jayron Hosley and Trevin Wade before the addition of McGee. \nCunningham earned a spot as the Giants' third tight end coming out of training camp, but he had been inactive for all but one game this season, both as a healthy scratch and while dealing with a knee injury. Cunningham has one catch for three yards this year, and was wearing a large knee brace during practice this past week. \nThe Giants now have only two tight ends on the active roster in Larry Donnell and Will Tye, and none on the practice squad, so they will likely be adding a tight end in some capacity over the next few days. It was not immediately clear whether the Giants would potentially re-sign Cunningham if he clears waivers, a source told NJ Advance Media. \nJames Kratch can be reached at jkratch@njadvancemedia.com or by leaving a note in the comments below.
