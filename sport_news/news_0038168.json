He's just pumped up for the postseason and rooting for the Chicago Cubs, who open their National League Division Series against the Cardinals in St. Louis.\nLet's go @Cubs pic.twitter.com/EAQAAreiEN\nâ€” Donovan McNabb (@donovanjmcnabb) October 9, 2015\nHere's a look at the matchup:\nThis is the first postseason meeting between the longtime Midwest rivals. Virtually every regular-season game is a sellout at both ballparks regardless of the standings, and the intensity will only ramp up in October. ... The NL Central featured the top three teams in baseball, with the Cardinals, Pirates and Cubs finishing 1-2-3 in wins. ...\nThe Cardinals won the season series but dropped six of the last nine meetings. St. Louis had a 3.93 ERA against the Cubs, going 7-3 at home and 4-5 at Wrigley Field. ... Lackey gets the ball in Game 1 due to his wealth of postseason experience, including pitching the Game 6 clincher for Boston against St. Louis in the 2013 World Series. The 36-year-old right-hander was 9-4 with a 1.93 ERA at home and posted an over ERA below 3.00 for the first time in his career. ...\nThe Cubs had moments like this in mind when they signed Lester to a $155 million, six-year contract in the offseason. Now, it's time for him to deliver. He played on two championship teams in Boston and is 6-4 with a 2.57 ERA in 12 postseason starts and 14 appearances for the Red Sox and Oakland Athletics. He won both starts vs. St. Louis in the 2013 World Series, allowing just one run over 15 1-3 innings. In five outings against the Cardinals this season, he was 1-3 but had a 2.59 ERA. Ross is Lester's regular catcher, taking Montero's more dangerous bat out of the lineup.\n(The Associated Press contributed to this report.)\nKevin Manahan may be reached at kmanahan@njadvancemedia.com .
