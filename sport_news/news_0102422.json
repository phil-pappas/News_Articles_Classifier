Counting the last weekend of exhibitions, seven of eight.\nThat is a lot, and it is unusual.\nThe team that used to travel just about the most in every NHL season, living in the Eastern Time Zone and playing mostly in Western ones, will travel the least this season.\nBut, oh, all those back-to-backs early.\n“Sports are relentless, and you have to continue to excel to have a chance to succeed,” coach Jeff Blashill said.\n“I think every day, you get to see what you’re about, as a team. And every day, you get a chance to prove what you’re about as a team.\n“We better be ready to play. Where we’re at as a hockey team is that we’re continuing to grow.”\nIn one big way, all the back-to-back action is serendipity. What could have been portrayed as a goaltender controversy from the start of the season seems much less so because Jimmy Howard and Petr Mrazek are to mostly split the consecutive games, which include 12 of the first 21.\nThat gives Blashill and the goaltender about a quarter of the season to determine the No. 1 netminder, unless one suddenly turns sour or they continue to split much of the balance of the schedule.\nIt also adds some motivation for the new coach’s determination to keep everyone’s time on ice comparatively even, especially along the blue line.\n“I’m a believer in energy management,” Blashill said. “I think energy management on the bench can be as important as matchups. Energy management means you’re fresh and ready to go, every time you are on the ice, and that can lead to more aggressive play.”\nMind over matter \nPlayers say they certainly realized early the need to accommodate the scheduling quirk.\nBut it caused the Red Wings some trouble last weekend.\nAfter an emotional Opening Night win over their former coach Mike Babcock and his Maple Leafs, the team — to a man, it seemed — had trouble getting anything going for two periods against the Hurricanes on the road the next night.\nThey were outshot by an astounding 34-8 the first two periods before Teemu Pulkkinen’s pair of goals tied the game and sent the Wings ahead in the first 6 1 / 2 minutes of the third.\n“We started slow last time, and couldn’t catch up,” Luke Glendening said. “I think we just couldn’t get skating.”\nIn truth, however, the only way of adapting is to get good rest, good nutrition and work hard during the offseason on conditioning, the players say. And then, if the feet do not quite answer the bell, dire circumstances require mind over matter and mustering the willpower.\nEating right and respite, though, provide a good platform for launching the psychological effort.\n“Obviously, those are two huge factors, and being ready to go in the second game,” said Drew Miller, in his ninth season.\nMiller, 31, has consecutive seasons of playing all 82 games for the Wings.\n“I think you’ve just got to be mentally prepared and just kind of tell yourself, ‘Let’s get going. You’ve got to bring it for 60 minutes,’ “ he said.\n“You can’t take a night off. We all know that.”\nFinding a rhythm \nMiller said it also is generally easier if the back-to-backs are later in the season, when the rhythm of the grinding NHL schedule is more established.\n“You kind of get used to it. Once you get into the season, you kind of get into that rhythm,” he said. “It’s not as big as it is at the beginning of the season, when you’ve got to kind of relearn how it is to play two games in a row.”\nLandon Ferraro has done it before, and the fact it was in the AHL makes the NHL games easier.\n“I just spent four years in the American League, that’s how we do are scheduling down there,” Ferraro said. “We had three-in-threes, three games in four nights, and stuff like that.\n“I’m pretty used to them.”\nBesides, Ferraro said, you just cannot beat the better mode of transportation in the big time.\n“We were busing between them. So, this is perfect,” he said.\n“And, besides, guys know how to deal with it; especially the veterans. Like, this morning was an optional skate. Guys know whether they need to be out there or not, or if they need to rest up.\n“I mean, you just kind of deal with it. That’s how the league works.\n“You just make sure you’re taking care of yourself, as best you can. We have pre-game naps and everything like that. But, you know, it’s kind of hard when you fly in somewhere and you get to the hotel, and you’re kind of awake again.\n“Everyone has their own way of kind of winding down quick, so they get to sleep as quickly as they can when they get in.”\ngregg.krupa@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/greggkrupa", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:04:40.101+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
