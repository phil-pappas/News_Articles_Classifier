In fact, it was pretty miserable. Any hope of tying the league championship series against the Kansas City Royals was long gone by the top of the ninth inning. The Jays were being pummelled 12-2 when Toronto infielder Cliff Pennington took the mound.\nWhen they have to bring in a guy who’s never pitched in the big leagues before, some people would give in to the misery of losing. Most people would probably look away, and hope for the game to end. Not the Jays, who have made a statement as one of Major League Baseball’s most emotionally inspiring team this postseason.\nReserve players were standing in the dugout waiting to see how the 31-year-old would fare.\n(Harry How/Getty Images) (Harry How/Getty Images) (Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press) Pennington’s first pitch was a 91 mph strike right down the middle.
