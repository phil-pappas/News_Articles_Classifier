Three quality football teams – Lakeland, Westwood and Waldwick/Midland Park – are tied for the eighth spot with two weeks remaining, and none have a particularly easy ride ahead.\nWestwood (3-3), the defending champion, snapped a three-game losing streak last week against Fort Lee. On Friday night, it hosts No. 3 Ramsey (4-2), a team that has won four of its past five, including Friday’s 28-20 upset of Ridgefield Park.\nWaldwick/Midland Park (4-2) has dropped two of its past three. The Warriors face Manchester this weekend, but draw unbeaten Rutherford in two weeks with a possible spot on the line.\nLakeland (4-2) has the hardest road by far, with a pair of unbeaten Group 4 teams on tap. The Lancers face Wayne Valley (6-0) on Friday night and NV/Old Tappan a week later, so they’re going to need a major upset and/or a box full of residual points to crash the party.\nNORTH 1, GROUP 1: Last week’s loss to Becton was a big blow to Saddle Brook (4-2), dropping the Falcons out of the top eight in one of North Jersey’s most competitive brackets. They need a big bounce-back win Friday night against North Arlington (2-4), a team trying to stop a four-game losing streak and keep its flickering North 2, Group 1 hopes alive.\nCresskill (4-2) climbed back into the seventh spot by beating No. 2 Park Ridge, and have a lot more power points on the table Friday when they face No. 3 Hasbrouck Heights (5-1).\nNORTH 1, GROUP 5: The pressure is on Hackensack (3-2) in Friday’s matchup with No. 1 Ridgewood (5-1). The Comets have slipped back into the ninth slot, but really can shuffle this race with a victory over a Ridgewood team riding a five-game winning streak.\nNON-PUBLIC GROUP 4: Paramus Catholic (3-3) is finally back in the mix, jumping all the way to No. 5 after last week’s win over Friendship Academy (D.C.). Two straight wins has salvaged PC’s season, and it still has a shot at an opening-round home game if it can pull off a huge upset Friday night against an IMG Academy (Fla.) team that already has beaten Bergen Catholic and St. Joseph.\nThis bracket is going to look much different next week after No. 2 St. Joseph (5-2) plays No. 4 Bergen Catholic (4-2) on Saturday in Oradell. BC follows that up with a game against No. 1 Don Bosco, so the Crusaders will have a major impact on how this race finally shakes out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:46:49.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
