And they have their sights set on returning to Winnipeg -- for the Grey Cup -- in a month. \nThat speaks to how far this team has come. They fight for everything they get. They believe. They're resilient. They're not intimidated. No obstacle seems too large. And they've become brothers -- all for one and one for all is the mentality that's needed for good teams to become great teams. \nSo Grey Cup? Well, that seems like so far away. No need to worry, the players aren't getting ahead of themselves. The mantra has long been \"one game at a time.\" \nThe RedBlacks have a couple of games with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats these next two weeks that will decide first place in the CFL East. The first-place team gets a bye and a spot in the CFL East championship game, one win away from the Grey Cup. With the Toronto Argos lurking just one win behind, the RedBlacks could still finish as low as third and have to go on the road for all of its playoff life. The RedBlacks would obviously like to have the #RNation home-field advantage for at least one playoff date. \nWith a 10-win season (and counting), the RedBlacks have hit a territory not known since the 1978 Rough Riders won 11 games (in a 16-game season). That team had the likes of Condredge Holloway, Tom Clements and Tony Gabriel. \nAnd now, the RedBlacks travel to Hamilton for a game on Sunday, before returning home to finish the regular season the following Saturday. If the RedBlacks can beat the Ticats twice, they wrap up first place. A split or two losses and it gets more complicated. \n\"When we saw the schedule and when we were getting together for training camp, a lot of us came to the conclusion this would be a battle for first,\" said quarterback Henry Burris who, on Saturday, shrugged off a late hit to his knee by Jamaal Westerman with nine seconds to go in the first half. \"It's going to be one big dogfight. We fought our butts off all year for this opportunity ... so here we go.\" \nSaid defensive back Brandyn Thompson, who had two huge interceptions vs. Winnipeg: \"Two teams, winner takes the division. You can't ask for anything more than that, it's a beautiful thing.\" \n\"The feeling in the locker room is we're ready,\" said defensive tackle Keith Shologan. \"The GM brought in some mature players who were in the league to go along with the guys who were already here. We're prepared to make our own destiny.\" \nThe RedBlacks could have/should have put Saturday's game away earlier. The stats favoured Ottawa by a large margin - 525 yards of offence compared to 283 and a time of possession advantage of 38:06 to 21:54. It was choppy and sloppy at times. \n\"We got some turnovers, which was good, but we didn't cash in enough,\" said coach Rick Campbell. \"Those are things we have to get better at.\" \n\"That's football,\" said Shologan. \"The only stat that really matters are the points at the end of the game and the win-loss column. Stats-wise, it was a good game, we played well. We scored points and stopped them when we needed to.\" \nA bright spot for the offence was the continued effectiveness of running back William Powell, who, although he fumbled deep in Winnipeg territory, had 117 yards on the ground. Establishing that running game is important, according to the coach. \n\"We have to make sure we do that enough so we don't put our O-line in a position where they have to pass protect too often,\" said Campbell. \"We're good at throwing the ball, but it's very important to mix things up through run and play-action.\" \nTo be sitting with a 10-6 record, to be talking about first place and playoffs and to hear whispers of being good enough to play in the Grey Cup, it's all good for the RedBlacks. \n\"We're battle tested, we've found a way to win a lot of close games,\" said Thompson. \"We just have that confidence that when everything's on the line, we know we can get it done.\" \nOne play we liked \nGutsy, but great call by the RedBlacks to gamble on a third-and-goal situation from just outside the one-yard line with 45 seconds left. A field goal would have given them a three-point lead and forced the Blue Bombers to equal that, no easy task against Ottawa's defence. But the coaches put faith in their blockers and in Henry Burris and the QB crashed over for what was the game-winning touchdown. \nOne play we didn't like \nIt wasn't so much the idea, but it was the execution of a squib kick that landed in the hands of Blue Bombers linebacker Ian Wild on a kickoff. The RedBlacks had a 4-0 lead at the time and Wild eluded tacklers for 18 yards, giving the Bombers great field position at their own 48-yard line. \nWhat went right \nIt was a bit of a rollercoaster ride, plenty of ups and downs. But the RedBlacks kept their composure. A year ago, when faced with challenges, the RedBlacks seemed to fall apart. Not this year. That goes with maturity and confidence. The team has momentum at a time of year when that could be the difference between playing the next week or going home until next spring. \nWhat went wrong \nAs much as the RedBlacks are capable of moving the ball, with yards being torn off in bunches, they again didn't capitalize on some golden opportunities. Henry Burris threw two interceptions, something he hasn't done much of this season. And William Powell fumbled in Bombers territory. The RedBlacks let the Bombers hang around for too long in a game that should have been under control. \nOffensive grade \nB \nThe first-half stats would show the RedBlacks should have been putting the hammer down on the Blue Bombers, but they led just 16-10 at the half. It wasn't Henry Burris' best game; he threw a couple of interceptions and bounced the ball into the turf, short of his receivers, on a couple of passes. He looked a bit tentative after getting hit low by Winnipeg's Jamal Westerman in the final seconds of the first half. But he still had 413 yards passing, tough to knock that. \nDefensive grade \nA- \nReally, a very good effort, interrupted only by a couple of mental mistakes and an injury to Ottawa DB Jerrell Gavins. Darvin Adams got behind Gavins when he appeared to suffer a leg injury while in coverage. Gavins left the game after the play. Adams later beat Abdul Kanneh for 43 yards. Six sacks and good pressure from the defensive line was a key. \nSpecial teams grade \nB+ \nJamill Smith, in his first game back with the RedBlacks, had four kickoff returns for 90 yards, with a best of 36. He replaced Chris Williams on punt return and had 31 yards on four tries. Punter Ronnie Pfeffer was good, averaging 46.8 yards. Chris Milo hit on both of his field goals, but was wide on a convert try. Nigel Romick made a couple of big hits on special teams. \nThe Big Number \n5: Yards gained on a punt by Winnipeg's Lirim Hajrullahu, who shanked it badly for 15 yards, then took a 10-yard penalty when the kick went out of bounds on the fly. \n6: Number of sacks by Ottawa's defensive line. A great effort, which included three sacks by Justin Capicciotti. \n19: Number of rushing yards by the Blue Bombers, who were stymied by an aggressive Ottawa defence. \n46.8: Average yards per punt for Ottawa kicker Ronnie Pfeffer, who shanked one, but was very good, with a longest of 60 \"Â¦ and two singles. \n117: Number of rushing yards by RedBlacks running back William Powell, who had 22 carries, scored a touchdown and continued his superb play since replacing the injured Jeremiah Johnson. \nThe Man: Brad Sinopoli \nThe RedBlacks receiver caught eight passes for 120 yards. It pushed him past the 1,000-yard mark for the season. Many of those yards have come after the catch. He's fast, elusive and keeps his feet moving when the ball is in his hands. A very, very solid candidate to be the CFL's Most Outstanding Canadian this season. \nNext Up \nThe Hamilton Tiger-Cats, a team the RedBlacks have never beaten, Sunday at Tim Hortons Field. The RedBlacks lost 33-23, 16-6 and 34-25 in a 2-16 2014 season and lost an exhibition game 37-10 early in June. But this isn't the same RedBlacks team. And the Tiger-Cats are missing their best offensive player - quarterback Zach Collaros. The B.C. Lions obviously figured something out Friday night, hammering the Ticats 40-13. If the RedBlacks close out their season with two wins over Hamilton, they'll lock up first place and a spot in the East championship game. \nCoaches Challenge \nThe RedBlacks got a look at Jamill Smith on both punt and kickoff returns. Smith, who was cut in mid-June after being a returner and sometimes-receiver for the 2014 season. It's not a knock on Smith - I like what he brings in a lot of ways - but I wouldn't give up on Chris Williams as my punt returner. He's the best option the team has, just check his resume. \nPivotal Performance: Brandyn Thompson \nThe defensive back had two interceptions. In both cases, he laid off the receiver a bit, then swooped in and took the ball away. Props as well to defensive end Justin Capicciotti for his five tackles and three sacks.
