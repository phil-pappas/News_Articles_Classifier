And those extra days could prove vital. In their last game, Oklahoma allowed 38 points and 427 passing yards to Tulsa. Sooner signal caller Baker Mayfield is averaging 354 passing yards per game but the OU staff and players know it should be much more difficult to gain traction against a West Virginia defense, and in particular a secondary, that has yielded 23 points in three games.
