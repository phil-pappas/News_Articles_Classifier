Photo: Bill Kostroun When Sergey Karasev made his preseason debut for the Nets in Saturday afternoon’s loss to the 76ers in Albany, it was exactly seven months after he’d crumpled to the ground in a heap inside Barclays Center with a devastating right knee injury.\nThose seven months left Karasev with plenty of time to think about himself and his game, as he tried to get back into playing condition. That reflection led Karasev to declare at media day the Nets would see “a new Sergey” this season.\n“Because I missed [the game] and I was really hungry about basketball,” said Karasev, who had seven points in 16 minutes Saturday. “I was working hard all summer long to build up muscle, and I feel more confidence on the court, and I think when I feel more confidence in my game, I feel I play way better.”\nIt’s been an odd first two seasons in the NBA for Karasev, who was taken with the No. 19 pick by the Cavaliers in 2013. The Russian native played 22 games for Cleveland as a rookie, spending a healthy amount of time playing for the Canton Charge, Cleveland’s D-League team. He was traded to the Nets last summer along with Jarrett Jack as part of a three-team trade to help clear cap space for the Cavaliers to sign LeBron James.\nKarasev got a brief chance to play last season, starting 16 games in December and January, but mostly was out of the rotation until he collided with Pelicans center Alexis Ajinca in the fourth quarter of a blowout loss on March 10. Karasev dislocated his patella and tore his MCL.\nThat doesn’t leave the Nets with a lot to go off later this month in determining whether or not to pick up Karasev’s fourth-year player option, though the expectation is the team will do so.\n“It’s really tough I think for every European player, and especially young guys, who come into the league,” Karasev said after Monday’s practice at the team’s New Jersey practice facility.\n“It doesn’t matter how big you were in Europe, here you just start everything from the beginning. When I came here, first it was tough for me from physically because I wasn’t a strong guy, but now I feel pretty good right now about myself on the court.”\nKarasev – who, despite going into his third NBA season, doesn’t turn 22 until Oct. 26 – is excited about the Nets shifting to a younger, more athletic team he feels suits his style of play.\n“This is what I like to play,” Karasev said. “Up-and-down, a lot of transition game, transition basketball. That’s my type of game, and I think if we’re going to play that type of game I can be very successful.”\nHe also could be the beneficiary of getting extra opportunities during the preseason, ironically because of other injuries the Nets have suffered on the wings. Entering the preseason, Karasev was looking at a crowded competition for playing time with Joe Johnson, Bojan Bogdanovic, Wayne Ellington, Markel Brown and rookie Rondae Hollis-Jefferson. But with Brown out for the rest of the preseason with an oblique strain and Bogdanovic and Hollis-Jefferson fighting ankle injuries, the door is open for Karasev to prove he’s ready to make an impact for the Nets in his third season.\n“The injuries are not good for everybody, but every time it’s a good opportunity for you when you have a chance to step on the court and put in all of your effort,” Karasev said. “This is what the NBA is about. It’s 82 games, it’s a long season, so everybody should be ready. Once somebody gets hurt, everybody has to step up on the court.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under brooklyn nets ,  sergey karasev", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:32:26.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
