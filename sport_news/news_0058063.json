They’re treating a 3-year-old girl with special needs like a queen - a homecoming queen.\nAvelynn just turned 3, and her nurses say she’s the strongest girl in the world. Little Avi was born with several complications, has undergone multiple open heart surgeries and was not expected to live past six weeks.\nThis summer, members of the Manual High School football team turned Avi’s backyard from a pile of dirt to grass - which she immediately fell in love with.\n“When we saw that little girl walk onto her new lawn, it touched my heart so much,” said Manual High School running back Losseny Kone. “I wanted to cry.”\nDefensive coordinator Benjamin Butler was moved as well.\n“It’s something that immediately touched us, and I think there’s so few times in your life when you can feel an immediate impact,” Benjamin said. “Normally, it takes days, weeks, years of reflections.”\nAvi made such an impact on the team, they wanted to do more.\n“There is something special about high school, and a high school football game on a Friday night, and meeting little Avi, we wanted to make sure we could share that experience with her,\" Benjamin said.\nSo the T-Bolts invited Avi to their homecoming game, and crowned her homecoming queen. It was another touching moment, Losseny said.\n“To see this little girl walk about and be crowned queen, it’s something she won’t probably experience ever, so it really means a lot to us,” he said.\nThe newly crowned 2015 Manual High School homecoming queen had just as big an impact on the team as they did to her.\nCopyright 2015 KDVR via CNN.
