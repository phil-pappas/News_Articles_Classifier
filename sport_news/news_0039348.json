But in a key game that was there for the taking, Freeport couldn't recover from its own costly mistakes. The Pretzels (4-3) committed four turnovers on the night including a critical fumble at the Blue Thunder 1 yard line when Freeport looked like it was going to tie the game on its first drive of the second half. \"We just had a lot of big mistakes and we haven't had that all year,\" Freeport coach Aaron Wichman said. \"We haven't had that many turnovers and at crucial times. If we're going to continue and try to make our way into the playoffs and win these next two games, we've got to get better.\" Vance McShane rushed for a game-high 168 yards and ignited the Pretzel offense early with a 65-yard touchdown run on Freeport's first play from scrimmage. He got Freeport's offense going to start the second half as well, rushing for 54 yards of a 10-play, 64-yard drive. But on a third-and-goal from the 1, McShane fumbled the ball into the end zone where North (5-2) was waiting to pounce on it. \"If we punch it in there in the third quarter and it's a tied ballgame, I thought we had the momentum,\" Wichman said. \"I thought we were able to move the ball and do some things and I think that took the wind out of our sails a little bit.\" But the Pretzels remained confident that they would get another chance. \"It's just one little slip up,\" Freeport senior two-way lineman Travis Buckwalter said. \"I knew we'd be able to stop them and get down the field again.\" While Freeport wouldn't get as close, the Pretzels did drive to the North 39. But they turned it over on downs with 7:42 remaining after a Ben Swords deep ball sailed just beyond the reach of Caleb Sellers, who had his man beaten downfield. The Blue Thunder offense then proceeded to chew up nearly five minutes of clock and converted a pair of fourth downs before scoring the game's final touchdown on a remarkable 35-yard reception by Jared Cantu. That all but ended the Pretzels' hopes of knocking off North. But they'll be back in Belvidere again next week to face the Bucs and try again for that elusive fifth win -- something Freeport hasn't achieved in seven years. \"We're just going to let it go,\" Buckwalter said. \"We've got to remember we're still 4-3. We've just got to get one more to get that 'P' word. I don't want to say it yet. It's just so close. It's right there.\" By Adam Kradle", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:45:37.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
