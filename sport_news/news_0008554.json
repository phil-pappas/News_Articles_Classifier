She’d never sung the National Anthem at a public event, so what better time to do it than before the last regular season home game of her career. \nCooperman performed the song flawlessly, then she and her teammates went out and improved to 16-0 overall and 14-0 in the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference on Tuesday night with a 3-0 victory over visiting Whitehall . \n“Being my first time, it was a little nerve-wracking,” Cooperman said. “I tried my best.” \nCooperman showed plenty of poise with her solo act. She sang the song with a steady tempo and pace, and displayed a strong, consistent voice that never showed signs of quivering. \nRELATED : Emmaus field hockey's 'Kiddie Corp' steals the show on Senior Night \n“I tried not to get too nervous because it makes it easier and your voice isn’t as shaky,” she said. “At least I had my teammates to support me if I messed up. Even if I did they would have said I did a great job, anyway.” \nHas Cooperman always had a strong voice? \n“I’d like to think so,” said Cooperman, who’s also done musicals. \nCooperman has made a verbal commitment to continue her career at James Madison University in Virginia. \nAt the age of 5 she began taking Kung Fu classes at her stepfather’s school. After several years of training she became a black sash in 2008, a second degree black sash in 2009, and a third degree black sash in 2012. \nAs a fourth grader she played the role of Blielke (the youngest daughter) in Fiddler on the Roof, which was performed at Muhlenberg College. \nCooperman was an Honorable Mention All-State selection in field hockey last season. This year she is one of the team’s tri-captains. \nOf all her many interests, she says singing and field hockey have always been at the top of her list. \n“Ever since I was young,” she said, “I’ve always stuck with (singing) and field hockey.” \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com .
