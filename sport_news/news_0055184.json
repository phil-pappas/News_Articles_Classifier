(AP) — Defenseman Simon Despres has agreed to a five-year, $18.5 million contract extension with the Anaheim Ducks. \nThe Ducks announced the deal Friday, a day before their season opener at San Jose. \nDespres has made an impressive rise with the Ducks since they acquired him in a trade with Pittsburgh on March 2. \nHe immediately won a regular spot in Anaheim’s lineup with physical two-way play, scoring six points in the Pacific Division champions’ final 16 regular-season games. Despres then stepped up in the playoffs, scoring seven points while the Ducks fell one game short of the Stanley Cup Final. \nThe 24-year-old Despres was a first-round pick by the Penguins in 2009, and he rose through Pittsburgh’s minor-league system before the club traded him to Anaheim for defenseman Ben Lovejoy. \nDespres would have been a restricted free agent next summer.
