(AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) Here are seven things you need to know about the new man in charge of the Dolphins defense.\n1. Anarumo, 49, is a native of Staten Island, New York. He earned his degree from nearby Wagner College, where he majored in special education. While at Wagner, he coached JV football at Susan E. Wagner High School right there in Staten Island.\n2. At age 23, he became the part-time running backs coach at Wagner College before moving to the same post at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. Interestingly enough, at the time, ex-Dolphins coach Joe Philbin was the offensive line coach there at Kings Point. The next year, Anarumo moved to Syracuse, where he served as a graduate assistant under defensive backs coach Phil Elmassian. The following fall, though, he headed back to the Merchant Marines, where he was promoted to defensive coordinator.\n3. After a couple of seasons with the Mariners, Anarumo was hired at Harvard as the assistant head coach and defensive backs coach. In Cambridge, he was reunited with Philbin, who at the time was in charge of the Crimson’s offensive line.\n4. Anarumo spent five years at Harvard before taking a job as the defensive backs coach at Marshall from 2001-03. In February of 2004, though, he replaced his former boss, Elmassian, as Purdue’s defensive backs coach . He remained with the Boilermakers for eight seasons, before taking a job with Philbin and the Dolphins in 2012. At the time, the Staten Islander said, “If you had told me when I was 18 I was going to raise my kids in Indiana, I would have told you you were crazy .”\n5. Interestingly, Anarumo has long been tied to his Miami predecessor Coyle. Not only is Coyle also a native of Staten Island, but he was also Syracuse’s defensive coordinator during Anarumo’s time with the Orange. When he was first hired by the Dolphins, Anarumo said of working with Coyle and Philbin, “I couldn’t be more excited. … Not only do you get an opportunity in the NFL, but you get it with people you know and trust and are friends.”\n6. In interviews, Anarumo has said that his coaching style follows that of his father, Lou Sr., a long-time teacher. Lou Jr. has told stories of how, when he was growing up, he and his father would take in New York Giants games at the old Meadowlands and he would dream about being on the field. But, like many, he soon realized that he wouldn’t reach it as a player.\n7. Anarumo and his wife, Fran, have three children: Madison, Louis and Christopher.\n</span", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/08/b5/f0/18594376-mmmain.jpg", "http://www.silive.com/sports/advance/dowd/index.ssf/2012/02/dream_chance_for_ex-wagner_ass.html", "http://www.purduesports.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/anarumo_lou00.html"], "published": "2015-10-09T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:37:14.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
