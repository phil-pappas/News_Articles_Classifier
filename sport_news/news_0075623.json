The 49ers won the game 16-10. ... more Help Beckham, Manning says 1 / 1 Back to Gallery East Rutherford, N.J.\nThere was something missing in the New York Giants ' offense in the second half against Philadelphia.\nOne can be flip and say everything was missing: plays, yards, first downs, points, consistency.\nThe Eagles dominated the Giants on Monday night, 27-7 in Philadelphia.\nThe truth is the biggest part missing was Odell Beckham Jr., the Giants' playmaker. The Eagles did an outstanding job of double-teaming him in the second half and he did not catch a pass. He was targeted once.\n\"Teams are going to try to take him away and that's fine,\" Manning said Wednesday as the Giants (3-3) started preparations for Sunday's game against the Cowboys (2-3) at MetLife Stadium. \"You have to move him around, don't make it easy for them. The other guys have to make plays. You have to find the guys in single coverage and that's what you have to wait for.\"\nForcing the ball to Beckham is not going to work. Occasionally it might, but the risk of turnovers is great.\nManning did not do that in the opening half in Philadelphia. He targeted Beckham seven times and completed passes for 61 yards and a touchdown on the opening drive.\nIn the second half Beckham was not available, and Manning had trouble finding receivers. He was sacked a season-high three times and hit five others times. He was under pressure seemingly every time he went back to throw as the Eagles forced the Giants into passing situations.\n\"That's part of football, sometimes you have those games,\" Manning said. \"Hopefully, you still get the ball out, you still get completions, you still run your offense. But you understand that is part of playing the quarterback position. There are some weeks things are not open down the field as fast as you want and you have to move around, buy some time and take some hits. That's all right.\"\nJets: Running back Stevan Ridley has practiced for the first time this season and could face the New England Patriots , his former teammates. Ridley is currently on the physically unable to perform list after tearing the anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments in his right knee while with the Patriots last season. Coach Todd Bowles said Wednesday that there's \"a chance\" Ridley could play Sunday. Ridley was a full participant at practice, but Bowles wants to see how he feels as the week progresses. Cornerback Dee Milliner , on short-term injured reserve, also fully participated but must miss two more games before he can be activated. Cornerback Buster Skrine (concussion), safety Jaiquawn Jarrett (knee) and running back Bilal Powell (ankle) all sat out.\nBills: Coach Rex Ryan still does not know who will start at quarterback for Buffalo against Jacksonville on Sunday in London. Backup EJ Manuel started and was inconsistent in place of Tyrod Taylor in last Sunday's loss to Cincinnati. Taylor started the first five games of the season but sprained a ligament in his left knee on Oct. 11. Taylor shared the reps with Manuel during Wednesday's practice. Taylor didn't say if he was going to start on Sunday, however, but that he was getting himself prepared to play.", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/53/63/8830148/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/53/63/8830148/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:34:10.659+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
