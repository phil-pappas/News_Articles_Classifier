But he had not played or coached the game at the top level and does not have the technical experience or expertise to cut it at international level. \n\"Look at the coaches in the Â­quarter-finals of the World Cup - Warren Gatland, Michael Cheika, Steve Hansen and so on - they are proven at the very highest level and they have an X-factor. The brutal truth is that Stuart does not have that at the moment. We have gone nowhere during the last four years and that is a terrible indictment.\" \nThomas says England missed a trick by not involving Woodward, the 2003 World Cup-winning coach, in their plans. \nHe said: \"The tragedy is that Clive should be managing English rugby. If he was, I am convinced we wouldn't be in the terrible mess we are now. We would be contending to win the World Cup, not packing our bags.\" \nAssessing what might have awaited England had they won a home World Cup, Thomas recalled the 2003 celebrations and said: \" It would have been on a different scale to that this time and we blew it.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T09:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:05:43.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
