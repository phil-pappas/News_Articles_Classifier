In the early 1960s, when Helen Lee Ray attended St. Vincent’s Academy and Armstrong Junior College, she and her classmates didn’t worry a bit about crime while strolling the streets of the Historic District.\n“We walked all over the place and didn’t think anything about it,” Helen recalled.\nSadly, that’s not the case anymore for plenty of folks, especially after last week’s afternoon shooting on Bull Street near Oglethorpe Avenue. Helen won’t soon forget the incident because she, her daughter and granddaughter literally dodged bullets that were fired at a man police describe as an intended target in a drive-by shooting. (The victim suffered non-life-threatening injuries and was taken to a local hospital.)\nHelen and her daughter, Tricia Austin and Tricia’s daughter, little Helen, were in town last week during little Helen’s fall break from school. Tricia and her husband (and little Helen) live in McDonough just a few minutes away from Helen.\nGrandmother Helen was raised in Savannah (she’s the daughter of the late Richard and Betty Lee) and now has a cottage on Tybee Island where she and Tricia and little Helen were staying.\n“Little Helen (age 7) is a Brownie and wanted to go to (Juliette Gordon Low’s birthplace),” Helen explained. “Every day she would ask, ‘are we going today?” Finally, the day before they were to leave for home, grandmother and mom decided to take little Helen to the birthplace for a tour.\nFollowing the tour, the trio was browsing at items in the gift shop on Bull Street at York Lane when gunshots rang out. At the time they were the only customers in the store. Even the workers were in another room, probably preparing to close for the day, Helen theorized.\n“I heard ‘pop, pop, pop’ and recognized the sound as a gunshot,” Helen explained. “I looked up and saw a hole in the window near where Tricia had been standing. Several bamboo umbrellas were sitting on a ledge by the window and, when the glass pane was hit, one of the umbrellas fell over and hit Tricia, who was that close, Helen said.\n“Glass was everywhere,” Tricia said. “It all happened so fast, I didn’t know what was going on.”\nDuring those frantic moments, Helen figured the gunshots had come from a sniper. In an all-business tone of voice, Helen, who is a retired teacher, commanded Tricia and little Helen to hit the floor. Little Helen, meanwhile, didn’t understand what was going on but knew not to ask questions when she heard her grandmother’s orders, Helen said.\nAs the trio crawled away from the windows, Helen yelled to the shopkeepers: “There’s a bullet hole in your window.’”\nThe workers offered bottles of water to all, presented a shaken little Helen with a box of Girl Scout cookies and helped them gather up their belongings. By this time, police cruisers and ambulances had arrived and crime scene tape was stretched across the front of the shop.\nThe workers opened the door to the lane to let out Helen, Tricia and little Helen who hurried to their car. When they were safe and sound, Helen noticed a tiny sliver of glass on Tricia’s forehead. She looked at both of her girls and the enormity of what had just happened hit home. At that point, she admits, she “got a little teary eyed.”\nThe following day, on the way out of town, the trio rode down Oglethorpe Avenue and took note of pedestrians walking along the same sidewalk where the shooting occurred. Both Helen and Tricia said they shudder to think about the crowds of Brownies and Girl Scouts from all over who could have been on the street when the man was shot.\n“It was really scary and so close,” Helen said. “You can be observant and careful but you can’t prepare for something like that.”\nContact Polly at 912-657-3887 or pollparrot@aol.com.\nBy Polly Powers Stramm", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-02T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:04:17.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
