In a lot of ways, the playoffs start tonight for the Pascack Valley and NV/Old Tappan football teams.\nIn one of the most anticipated games of the season, the Indians, No. 2 in The Record public football Top 20, face No. 1 NV/Old Tappan in Hillsdale. Both teams are unbeaten, and both have legitimate state sectional title aspirations.\nBut because Pascack Valley has dropped to North 1, Group 3 this season, the only way these teams possibly can see each other at MetLife Stadium in December will be in the tunnel between games.\n“That’s the first thing I thought of when I heard we were dropping down,” said Pascack Valley senior wide receiver Mike Pimpinella, whose team has won two straight North 1, Group 4 championships. “I was bummed that we wouldn’t have a chance to play teams like Wayne Hills and Old Tappan in the playoffs.\n“Those are the teams we’ve built rivalries with over the years. So that just adds to the playoff feeling in this game.”\nThe big thing to remember, though, is that neither team will have to pack it in after a loss. Hearts might be broken, and there will be a certain level of frustration, but it’s only mid-October and the party is just getting started.\nA lot of funny things can and usually do happen on the way to MetLife Stadium, and neither team can afford a letdown after this one — not if they truly want to play December football.\nConsider the Indians. Dropping to Group 3 wasn’t exactly a gift, because that bracket is the toughest public-school bracket in North Jersey.\nTwo weeks from now, the Indians have to play Ramapo, a team that came within a hair of upsetting the Golden Knights last month. Any discussion of the top public team in North Jersey has to include the Green Raiders (4-1), and they’ll surely want to prove something against the Indians.\nThat game, just as significant as tonight’s, likely will be for first place in the Big North Independence Division, and maybe for home-field advantage in a playoff game. Heck, if things break right, it could be a preview of the North 1, Group 3 title game.\nAs for the Golden Knights, as good as they’ve been, they might not even be the team to beat in North 1, Group 4. We don’t get to see Roxbury play, but folks well-versed in statewide football keep saying it would be a stunner if the Gaels weren’t playing for a title this season.\nThe target on NV/OT’s back would only grow bigger with a win tonight, making the Golden Knights every team’s big game the rest of the way. That’s when those funny things we talked about earlier can start happening.\nSo both teams better enjoy that “playoff feel,” because starting tonight, it’s their steady diet the rest of the way.\nEmail: czerwinski@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:46:38.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
