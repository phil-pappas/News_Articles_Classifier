There’s a “Taiwanese Fried Noodle,” “Fried Rice Cake” and “Mixed Noodle Soup.” But the sixth item has no English translation—making it, for me at least, the most compelling dish on the menu.\nLike many tech-savvy food-lovers, I pulled out my phone, launched an app called Waygo ( available for Android and iOS, $7 for unlimited use), and trained my phone’s camera on the mystery item. Orange dots twinkled over the Chinese characters for a second, then a transliteration of the characters appeared (sha gua mian) as well as a translation: “Idiot Noodles.” I’d have to be an idiot not to order those, I thought.\nFor adventurous eaters with limited linguistic skills, translation apps are becoming indispensable, especially as the technology behind them becomes more sophisticated. Computers still struggle with handwritten text in any language, but they are making inroads. Waygo, for example, couldn’t make sense of the specials, which were scribbled on red strips of paper hanging on the restaurant’s wall, but Google Translate (available for Android and iOS, free) fared better. After drawing a few blanks when I pointed the camera at the signs, it got a hit: “Master Lin Hot and Sour Pork Ribs.” Order decided.\nSometimes, the apps are too literal. “Idiot Noodles,” my waitress told me, was more accurately translated as “Crazy Noodles.” But thankfully, Waygo sometimes serves helpful descriptions along with its translations. For instance, point it at a Korean menu, and it tells you not only that says gunmandu but that those are fried dumplings. Even better, Waygo does this without requiring an Internet connection.\nIn part, a desire to broaden his diet led Ryan Rogowski, co-founder of Waygo, to start his company. After studying linguistics and computer vision at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Mr. Rogowski moved to Beijing to work for an app startup. “I could barely read any Chinese,” he said, “and I was so scared of getting sick, that I figured out the words for kung pao chicken.” After eating that dish nearly every day for a month, he decided to build an app that used a smartphone’s camera to recognize the thousands of characters in the Chinese logographic system.\nWhen the name of a dish is too vague, poetic or colloquial to be informative (the Crazy Noodles turned out to be linguine-like noodles topped with a rich ground-pork sauce, analogous to a Bolognese), a picture can be worth a thousand calories. While its speed and character-recognition abilities are nowhere near as good as Google Translate or Waygo, Instant Translator ( available for Android, free ) offers one irresistible feature: instant access to Google’s image search. Focus on, tap the “image search” button, and your screen fills with photos of crisp-bottomed dumplings. (Surprisingly, Google Translate doesn’t provide this option.)\nDiners who would rather interact with a waiter and not just a smartphone should consider iTranslate ($5 for iOS, $3 for Android, limited free version also available), which uses both Google’s and Microsoft’s translation engines to support 92 languages. The app offers Mandarin, Cantonese and Taiwanese as well as Arabic from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates or Saudi Arabia—distinctions that can be crucial in some situations.\n‘ When the translation of a dish’s name is too poetic to be informative, a picture can be worth a thousand calories. ’\nIf you don’t need all of those variants, Google Translate is the most efficient way to chat. At one restaurant in Manhattan’s Chinatown, where none of the staff were proficient in English, I set my phone on the edge of the table while I spoke with the waitress. The app listened to my questions, and to her answers in Mandarin, and displayed real-time translations for both of us on a split screen. I learned that the market price for an order of fried whelks that day was $28.\nThe quality of Google’s translations vary. On a recent trip to Mexico City, I visited El Hidalguense, a restaurant known for its barbacoa —mutton wrapped in agave leaves and cooked in a pit over a wood fire. I started in Google Translate’s Instant Visual Translation mode , which superimposes translated text over the original. This is a perfect for deciphering short texts, such as signs, labels and dish descriptions. However, when I used it to read a large block of writing explaining the history of barbacoa on the back of the menu, I was presented with something that looked like a cut-and-paste ransom note—one that made little sense. I had better luck when I engaged the app’s standard photo translator: A blue bar swept across the image and the app highlighted each word individually so it could be selected for spot translation. Touching “select all” converted the entire body of text to understandable English with speed and finesse.\nAccording to Barak Turovsky, Google Translate’s Product Lead, the service handles about 100 billion words a day in 90 languages for 500 million people. It, and these other apps, have opened dining possibilities in ways I could scarcely have imagined a few years ago. I still spend a lot of time gesturing, smiling, and bumbling with speakers of other languages in pursuit of the next great bite. But with these apps, I’m aware of dishes that I otherwise would never have known existed.\nIn the subterranean warren of food stalls of Golden Shopping Mall in Flushing’s Chinatown, on a post in a kitchen near the stand where Xi’an Famous Foods started a mini empire , I spied an untranslated sign in boldface type:\nCould these words be exhorting me to try some new, great dish that I’ve never had? I whipped out my phone and scanned.\n“Outside food declined to enter thank you!” (In other words, don’t bring food in from outside.)\nI was still thrilled to read it.\nMore in Gear & Gadgets Men, Don’t Fear the Rose-Gold iPhone Winning Strategies for Buying a Chess Set Smart Little Suckers: Next-Gen Robot Vacuums Should Parents Play Videogames With Their Children?
