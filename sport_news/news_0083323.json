It was his first action since he broke his left collarbone in Virginia Tech’s season-opening loss to No. 1 Ohio State. \nThe Hokies (3-4, 1-2 Atlantic Coast Conference) will play host to Duke (5-1, 2-0) on Saturday. \nOffensive coordinator Scot Loeffler said the time is right to make the change. \nMotley struggled against the Hurricanes, throwing two interceptions and losing a fumble. \nBrewer played the fourth quarter, throwing a touchdown pass and an interception. \n“Over the last couple of weeks, he was able to obtain some practice reps and try to get the glitches out of his shoulder injury,” Loeffler said. “And I think in the time he’s been gone, Motley’s done an excellent job. He stumbled Saturday, and it’s just the right time for Virginia Tech to have Michael as our quarterback. \nBrewer, a senior, started all 13 games for the Hokies last season. \nHe was cleared to return to practice in a noncontact capacity a few weeks ago but wasn’t given the OK for game situations until last week. Loeffler said he never considered starting him. \n“I think this week of practice will be essential for him,” Loeffler said. \nMichigan State: Defensive back Jalen Watts-Jackson was released from the hospital and returned to campus Monday, a day after he had surgery on a hip he injured while scoring the winning touchdown against Michigan. \nWatts-Jackson grabbed a Michigan fumble on the final play of the game and returned it 38 yards to give the Spartans an incredible 27-23 victory Saturday. The redshirt freshman appeared to land hard on his left hip while being tackled by Michigan tight end Jake Butt. \nHis surgery Sunday at the University of Michigan hospital lasted more than three hours.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:57:09.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
