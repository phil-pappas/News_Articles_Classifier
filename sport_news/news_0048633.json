(AP Photo/Rod Aydelotte) more > By STEPHEN HAWKINS   \nWACO, Texas (AP) - Corey Coleman caught three more touchdowns and second-ranked Baylor won its FBS-best 19th consecutive home game, getting some measure of revenge with a 62-38 victory over West Virginia on Saturday. \nColeman matched and then broke the single-season school record for TD catches, his nation-leading 16 coming halfway through the regular season for the Bears (6-0, 3-0 Big 12). \nSeth Russell became the only Baylor quarterback other than Heisman Trophy winner Robert Griffin III in 2011 to throw for 300 yards and run for 100 yards in the same game. Russell had five TD passes and ran 14 times for 160 yards with another score. \nBaylor’s only regular-season loss last year was 41-27 at West Virginia, and the Bears wound up the first team left out of the initial College Football Playoff. \nSkyler Howard, from Fort Worth, Texas, less than 100 miles from the Baylor campus, threw four TD passes for West Virginia (3-3, 0-3). \n___ \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:06:13.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
