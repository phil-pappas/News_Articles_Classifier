Unfortunately, “next man up” is the only thing Illini basketball players and Illini basketball coaches can really say right now about the rash of injuries that just keep coming. \n“Next man up,” as meaningless a phrase as it is, happens to also be the only place Illini basketball fans can look right now. \nIt all started this summer when Tracy Abrams tore his Achilles tendon, ruling him out for the rest of the season. This followed up Abrams’ ACL tear in 2014, meaning that he’ll miss two consecutive seasons now. \nIf there is a “college basketball Derrick Rose,” then Abrams would be the closest comparison. \nIllinois forward Leron Black will miss four-to-six weeks with a torn meniscus. On the plus side, the surgery went well, and he’s already off crutches. \nSaid Illini wing Malcolm Hill at Big Ten Media Day today: \n“Leron, he won’t be back until the third game of the season, hopefully sooner.” \nKendrick Nunn injured his thumb Tuesday at practice, and therefore missed his scheduled appearance at Big Ten Media Day. \n“Don’t know yet, today he’s being evaluated,” said Illini basketball coach John Groce of Nunn’s status, before giving the media an update on shooting guard Jalen Coleman-Lands, the highest rated recruit that Groce has ever landed at Illinois. \n“Coleman-Lands will be back here pretty soon and he’s going to learn the two spot,” Groce said. \nJCL is recovering from a stress fracture. Oh by the way, point guard Jaylon Tate is out with a concussion. \nHill on the Illini basketball big picture, in the wake of all the setbacks: \n“Injuries like this, they don’t really bug us at all. We’re upset that it’s happening, but at the same time, we’re keeping it positive. Praying for a speedy recovery for all of ’em.” \nSaid Groce: “at this juncture, we’ll play the cards that we’re dealt and I think it opens up an opportunity for other guys.” \n“A door opens to get more reps, to play two positions instead of one. They’ve got to sprint through that open door. We’ve got to figure it out.” \nIt’s Groce-ly unjust, the bad cards that the Illinois Coach has been dealt on the injury front. It’s a figuratively snake-bitten Illinois program right now. \nBut do remember “next man up” is nothing more than a simple depth chart. When Groce, or any other coach, or any player in any sport tells you “next man up” is a unique “culture” or distinctive “philosophy” special to that specific team, please, pay no mind. \nIt’s just a press conference/press release buzzword, not a deep profound, ground-breaking organizational mantra. Nailed it! Perfectly predicted John Groce dropping a \"next man up\" 1 minute ahead of schedule pic.twitter.com/uiy73vMRB3 \n— Paul M. Banks (@PaulMBanks) October 8, 2015 Again though, what else can Groce say in this situation? It’s sad. It’s unfortunate. It’s ridiculously unlucky and just borderline unfair. Whether you love Illini basketball, or hate it, or lack a strong opinion on this program, you have to feel some sympathy for the ludicrously bad cards that Groce and company have been dealt lately.
