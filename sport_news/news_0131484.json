That's sent Oregon's passing attack into a plunge, as backups Jeff Lockie and Taylor Alie struggled to stretch the field.\nThe woes contributed to the Ducks 62-20 loss to No. 4 Utah, and again didn't help offset Oregon's struggling defense in Saturday's 45-38 double overtime loss to Washington State at Autzen Stadium. \nOn Monday, Oregon offensive coordinator Scott Frost lamented the lack of continuity at quarterback as the Ducks prepare to face UW (3-2, 1-1 Pac-12) at Husky Stadium (7:30 p.m., Pac-12 Network) after the Huskies beat Southern California last week on the road. \n\"I think both Jeff (Lockie) and Taylor (Alie) have done some really good things the last two weeks and I have a real positive feeling about both of them continuing to improve going forward,\" Frost told reporters. \"But we need consistency at that position. We've played three people over the course of the year, and I don't care if you have exceptional players, it's hard to have people in and out of the games like that.\"\nWhether the Huskies end an 11-game losing streak to the Ducks that began in 2004 may hinge on whether Adams is healthy enough to play. It appeared like he might go last weekend against WSU, but instead Lockie started, going 13-for-22 for 123 yards, two touchdowns and one interception while Alie in limited action threw two passes, both incomplete.  This while running back Royce Freeman continued his monster season, rushing 27 times for a career-high 246 yards and two scores, plus 46 receiving yards and a touchdown. \nThe Ducks tried to play an injured Adams against Utah, but he struggled and was pulled. Oregon lost 62-20 at Autzen Stadium.\nWould Adams play against the Huskies if he isn't healthy? \n\"Well, we've been down that road,\" Frost said. \"The Utah game in particular, Vernon just couldn't throw it downfield, and we tried to go with him and have him gut it out like he did in the Michigan State game and we were doing a disservice to the team and to Vernon at that point having him out there in that condition.\"\nUW coach Chris Petersen said, if he had to guess, he expects Adams to play. Last year, in UW's home opener, the graduate transfer threw for 475 yards and seven touchdowns in UW's 59-52 win over the Eagles. \n\"He's been out for a while. I know he's been throwing, and those type of things,\" Petersen said. \"But we again can't really get hung up on that. That has nothing to do with us. They're going to run their system. I mean, I don't think it really changes. There might be some different plays they emphasize with him, but it all looks the same to me.\"\nPetersen was asked if he'll watch the film from Eastern's near upset to prepare in case Adams plays.\n\"I don't need to peek at that,\" he said. \"I remember it very clearly.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:24:53.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
