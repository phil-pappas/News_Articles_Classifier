With those kind of numbers -- five more than most teams carry -- Campolindo could make serious noise in the North Coast Section playoffs and beyond. \n\"It's so hard to continue cutting. I already cut eight (players) that are decent,\" Vuong said. \"People are like, 'How can you practice with 18 girls?' That's the beauty of it. We set up two courts, and we have them battle each other.\" \nWhichever side has Kirsten Sibley is in good shape. The fourth-year varsity starter is one of three co-captains, along with fellow seniors Emma Thompson and Macall Rempp, and usually leads the pep talk with some competitive banter. \n\"She can do everything,\" Vuong said of the 6-foot-2-inch Sibley, who is committed to Hawaii. \"She's so quick, she can go from one pin to the other pin -- and she has a clean shot.\" \nShe also has plenty of experience, including the Cougars' trip to the CIF Division 3 state title game in 2012 and their run to the North Coast Section Division 3 crown in 2013. \nLast year, however, her presence was missed in the playoffs. She suffered a concussion at a tournament on Halloween that kept her out until the opening match of the state playoffs, which she entered for a spell before exiting early. Advertisement \n\"She got three kills even though her head was ringing,\" Vuong said. \"I had to take her out, she couldn't do it anymore.\" \nEven without her, the Cougars reached the NCS title game and took a set off El Camino in the state tourney loss. Six seniors from that team are gone, but there are plenty of players to fill those spaces. Juniors Jaime Brown, Kelsey Budde, Josie Cole, Lauren Pak, Janelle Gong and Sabrina Smith all have varsity experience. \n\"You see teams where they have a very good year, and all the seniors leave, and the next year they go down, because ... they didn't develop younger players,\" Vuong said. \"We start to try them now, to put them in a place where they can be successful.\" \nCampolindo is 13-8 this fall after having moderate success at prestigious tourneys like the Durango Fall Classic in Las Vegas and the Presentation Panthers Challenge in San Jose. Their most impressive win may have been their first, a sweep of defending NCS Division 1 champion Monte Vista. \n\"We have a really young team, so there's a lot of spirit there and malleability to the tradition,\" said Thompson, who is headed to Loyola Marymount. \"Everyone's still learning, but learning at a really rapid pace, which makes it fun for all of us.\" ENDURANCE BASE: Granada's Megan McCandless' training has not been easy the day before her cross country races this season. \"We won't back off for a while,\" Granada co-coach Noel Mattern said. That was hard to tell Saturday at the Clovis Invitational, as McCandless was dominant in defending her Division 2 girls title. The senior turned a one-second lead at the one-mile mark at Woodward Park in Fresno into a 34-second lead by 2.1 miles on her way to winning the 3.1 mile race by more than 46 seconds with a time of 18:15.4 in hot conditions. \nMattern said that McCandless has increased her mileage this season to a consistent 50-60 miles per week. \n\"She's always been a very strong aerobic runner,\" Mattern said. \"She has this amazing endurance.\" \nThis season, McCandless has won the Ed Sias Invitational large school race and was second to a course-record performance by Davis' Fiona O'Keeffe at the De La Salle/Carondelet Nike Invitational at Newhall Park in Concord. McCandless produced one of the top-five girls times ever at that invitational (17:36 for the 3.0 mile course). \n\"We are really looking forward to what she can do in the championship part of the season,\" Mattern said.
