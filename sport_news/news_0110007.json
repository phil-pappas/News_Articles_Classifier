The Frogs have no right to be undefeated at this point ... except for Josh Doctson's inadvertently deflected pass to teammate Aaron Green in the final seconds. Michigan State-Michigan was wild, but TCU-Tech was wilder because of 107 points and nine lead changes.\nSolomon: Michigan State 27, Michigan 23 on Oct. 17. There will be better games start-to-finish this year than this one, but nothing figures to top the remarkable ending that occurred in Ann Arbor, moving Michigan-Michigan State to a more national rivalry.\nMost surprising team Dodd: Michigan. Jim Harbaugh is a quick starter in his first season but no one expected this. The losses have been by 7 to top 10 Utah and at the gun to Michigan State. These were the same players that went 5-7 last season under Brady Hoke. Four of the five starters in the offensive line returned, seven of the starters on defense. Harbaugh can make chicken salad out of chicken bleep real quick -- and better than anyone.\nSolomon: Utah. The media picked the Utes to finish fifth in the Pac-12 South. Instead, they're in the College Football Playoff mix and a physical team opponents don't want to face.\nMost disappointing team Dodd: Auburn. Maybe it's our fault. The media had Jeremy Johnson up for the Heisman and Auburn in the playoff before a ball was snapped. Gus Malzahn miscalculated Johnson's ability to handle â€¦ everything. Duke Williams never bought in. Few teams have been as up and down as the Tigers this decade alone. Two national championship berths, one title, a winless SEC season and now this.\nSolomon: Auburn. The No. 6 team in the Preseason AP Top 25 barely beat an FCS team, benched Gus Malzahn's hand-picked quarterback Jeremy Johnson after three games, kicked Duke Williams off the team, and still hasn't fixed its defense despite spending $1.6 million on Will Muschamp.\nCollege Football Playoff \nDodd \nSolomon \nPalm \nFornelli \nHinnen \nPatterson \nKalland After Week 7 1. 2. 3. 4. Most devastating injury Dodd: (tie) Malik Zaire, Notre Dame / Taysom Hill, BYU. A case can be made that, with their No. 1 quarterbacks, both teams would be undefeated.\nSolomon: Jalen Watts-Jackson, Michigan State. In the year of injuries, you could take your pick on so many of them. But it's hard to top becoming a legend by beating Michigan with no time left and then having to celebrate with season-ending hip surgery. Watts-Jackson will always have Oct. 17, 2015. Here's to a speedy recovery.\nMost valuable player Dodd: Trevone Boykin, TCU. Take him off the Frogs and they've lost twice already. Co-offensive coordinators Doug Meacham and Sonny Cumbie have created the most dangerous offensive player in the country. Boykin now seems to know it. He's on track to throw for 5,000 yards.\nSolomon: Trevone Boykin, TCU. There's a difference between the best player (Leonard Fournette) and the most valuable. Take away Fournette and LSU is still a really talented team, albeit not as good. Take away Boykin, and it's fair to wonder if TCU could win all of these shootouts and have any hope of beating Baylor, which is quietly dominating opponents.\nMost surprising development Dodd: Iowa being undefeated. The Hawkeyes themselves didn't see this coming. Now they've got a realistic chance to run the table. They don't have the speed of Baylor or the physicality of Utah, but they just keep winning. Budding star Jordan Canzeri may have suffered a serious ankle injury against Northwestern.\nSolomon: The American Athletic Conference has three undefeated teams, tied with the Big Ten and Big 12 for most in the country. Memphis (6-0) has beaten Ole Miss, Temple (6-0) knocked off Penn State, and Houston (6-0) has a win over Louisville. The AAC, which has the best crop of rising coaches in football, is battling Toledo for the Group of Five bowl bid.\nWill Ohio State repeat as this year's champion? Dodd: No. The signs are all there for any team trying to go back-to-back: stress, hubris, getting everybody's best shot. The Buckeyes have been good, not great for most of the season. Maybe after the Penn State game they're getting in a groove. But the Big Ten is better. Either Michigan or Michigan State seem capable of knocking off the Buckeyes. An 11-1 Ohio State that hasn't won the league is going to have a tough time getting into the top four.\nSolomon: No, though the Buckeyes are certainly capable. They still look like the most talented team in America but need to settle on a quarterback, even after naming J.T. Barrett the starter on Tuesday. The guess here is the Buckeyes slip up to Michigan State or Michigan.\nWhich Group of Five team will earn a New Year's Six bid? Dodd: Houston. This is a close call. Memphis looks better suited but has to go to both Houston and Temple in the AAC down the stretch, while Houston doesn't face Temple and gets Memphis at home on Nov. 14. The Cougars' offense is as efficient as anyone's these days.\nSolomon: Houston. Memphis looks like the American's best team at the moment, but roadblocks are coming that could result in a loss. The Tigers still play at Tulsa, Houston and Temple, plus a home game against Navy. Temple plays at East Carolina and has home games against Notre Dame and Memphis. Meanwhile, Houston doesn't play Temple this season (at least not until a possible conference championship game) and has all of its most challenging regular-season games left at home (Vanderbilt, Cincinnati, Memphis and Navy).\nWho is your Heisman front-runner (not named Leonard Fournette)? Dodd: Boykin. The ultimate firestarter at quarterback. Boykin almost single-handedly won the Texas Tech and Kansas State games. He's on pace for 5,000 yards passing. What wouldn't you give to watch Fournette and Boykin face off against each other in the playoffs?\nSolomon: Boykin, but it's Fournette's trophy to lose at this point. Keep an eye on Christian McCaffrey, who is playing at an elite level for a dangerous Stanford team.\nMidseason Honors \nDodd \nSolomon \nPalm \nFornelli \nHinnen \nPatterson \nKalland Players and Coaches of the Year Offensive Player Leonard Fournette, RB, LSU Leonard Fournette, RB, LSU Leonard Fournette, RB, LSU Leonard Fournette, RB, LSU Leonard Fournette, RB, LSU Leonard Fournette, RB, LSU Leonard Fournette, RB, LSU Defensive Player Blake Martinez, LB, Stanford Carl Nassib, DE, Penn State Myles Garrett, DE, Texas A&M Carl Nassib, DE, Penn State Jourdan Lewis, CB, Michigan Jeremy Cash, S, Duke Carl Nassib, DE, Penn State Freshman Player Christian Kirk, WR, Texas A&M Christian Kirk, WR, Texas A&M Josh Rosen, QB, UCLA Christian Kirk, WR, Texas A&M Minkah Fitzpatrick, CB, Alabama Christian Kirk, WR, Texas A&M Christian Kirk, WR, Texas A&M Head Coach Kyle Whittingham, Utah Kyle Whittingham, Utah Kyle Whittingham, Utah Kyle Whittingham, Utah Kyle Whittingham, Utah Jim McElwain, Florida Kyle Whittingham, Utah Assistant Coach D.J.

Durkin, DC, Michigan Kendal Briles, OC, Baylor Brent Venables, DC, Clemson Which conference will be left out of the CFP? Dodd: Pac-12. Either TCU or Baylor are going to run the table in the Big 12. Same for Florida State or Clemson in the ACC. The SEC winner is almost guaranteed a spot. Ohio State and Michigan State are still unbeaten in the Big Ten. That leaves the Pac-12 whose only hope may be Utah. The Utes are a fine team but still have to go to USC, Washington and Arizona. Utah is a complete team, but the question you've got to ask yourself is whether the Utes are good enough to 13-0, because that's probably what it's going to take.\nSolomon: Pac-12. This makes no sense based on my current pick of Utah at No. 1, right? In saying this, I'm banking on Utah losing at least once and Oregon's decline hurting the league's reputation, even though Utah and Stanford are teams nobody wants to play now. If the ACC champion has one or more losses, the ACC could be out.\nWhich game are you most looking forward to? Dodd: Clearly it's going to be Baylor at TCU on Nov. 27. The teams played the best game of 2014 (61-58, Baylor). They're the top two offensive teams this year with the top two quarterbacks. Heck, they may be the top two teams. Don't be surprised if the over-under is 120.\nSolomon: Take your pick: LSU at Alabama (Nov. 7); Florida State at Clemson (Nov. 7); Michigan State at Ohio State (Nov. 21); Baylor at TCU (Nov. 27); Ohio State at Michigan (Nov. 28).\nSecond half prediction that is sure to be wrong Dodd: Both Baylor and TCU will make the playoff. The pair were just about a consensus pick to do so in the preseason. Now it looks like it could actually happen a year after the Big 12 was shut out. It could happen this way: A narrow decision on Nov. 27 drops the loser from No. 2 to, say, No. 4. But that can't happen, can it? Football karma doesn't work that way. In the case of the Big 12, it just might.\nSolomon: Anything we think we know right now. It's that kind of year. There are just too many obstacles for Ohio State to repeat this season.
