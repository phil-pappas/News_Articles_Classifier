Wesleyan at Huntingdon A. Stacy Long , Montgomery Advertiser 7:32 a.m. CDT October 2, 2015 Huntingdon's John Iwaniec carries against Louisiana College in Montgomery, Ala. on Saturday September 5, 2015. (Photo: Mickey Welsh / Advertiser) \nRecords: Huntingdon (2-1, 0-0 USA South), N.C. Wesleyan (0-3, 0-0) \nOn the air: none \nTwitter: @kamarrid, @MGMsports \nFOUR-DOWN TERRITORY Huntingdon running back John Iwaniec ran for four touchdowns, tying a school record, in last weekend's win at Belhaven. Stacy Long \n1. Al Bundy moment: Huntingdon running back John Iwaniec tied a school record with four touchdown runs in last weekend’s 35-21 win at Belhaven. They covered 3, 2, 1 and 2 yards. “As long as we win the game, it’s fine with me no matter who gets them,” Iwaniec said. “I’m not going for any record. As long as the scoreboard is in our favor at the end of the game, that’s enough for me.” Courtney Moss set the record in 2010 and Garrett Fletcher tied it vs. North Carolina Wesleyan in 2013. “I’m glad John got four,” defensive back Brendon Brown said. “I hope he gets four more.” \n2. Preseason favorite: Huntingdon, the preseason USA South Athletic Conference favorite, finally gets to try to live up to that billing. The Hawks — Battling Bishops, too — are playing their league opener Saturday. “Being the No. 1 team in the conference, we definitely have a bull’s-eye on our chest,” Iwaniec said. “Everybody wants to knock you off.” Huntingdon coach Mike Turk says the Hawks need to focus on improving each day rather than worrying about the next game, which is Saturday's USA South opener against N.C. Wesleyan. Stacy Long \n3. Bishops in check: North Carolina Wesleyan’s 0-3 record is misleading, Huntingdon coach Mike Turk said. The Battling Bishops played two Division III teams who are now a combined 7-0 and a Division II school. “I don’t think our guys are fooled by their record,” Turk said. “They are our first conference game and they were our last last year. We had to fight, scratch and claw to get a win. I know our guys respect them.” \n4. Last year: The Hawks had two 100-yard rushers, including Iwaniec’s 114, and totaled a season-best 339 yards on the ground in a 37-20 season-ending win at North Carolina Wesleyan. \nPLAYER OF THE WEEK \nJacob Wright \nLB, 6-0, 225, Sr. \nWright made 13 tackles, the second most in his career, last week at Belhaven. He also led the Hawks with nine tackles in their season opener against Louisiana College but had none in Game 2 at Birmingham-Southern. \nBY THE NUMBERS \n8-2: Huntingdon’s all-time record in its homecoming games. The Hawks started tying homecoming to a home football game in 2005. \n4: Straight homecoming games won by Huntingdon since a 35-20 loss to Birmingham-Southern in 2010. \n4-0: Huntingdon’s all-time record against North Carolina Wesleyan. \n3,971: Total points scored by the Hawks since the program started in 2003. \n5: Times in school history that Huntingdon has had two 100-yard rushers in a game like the Hawks did last year at North Carolina Wesleyan. \n18: Career rushing touchdowns for junior running back John Iwaniec to rank third in Huntingdon history. \n2, 26: Rushing touchdowns needed by Iwaniec to tie Alex Baronich (2006-09) for second and tie Trevor Manuel (2009-12) for first, respectively. \nPREDICTION \nThe Hawks wheezed their way to a paltry 348 yards offense last week at Belhaven. How paltry? It was Huntingdon’s weakest output since mustering 334 yards in its 2012 season finale, a 17-16 home loss to Adrian. Maybe the Hawks will exceed that Saturday. Huntingdon 33, N.C. Wesleyan 21.
