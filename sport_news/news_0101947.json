The public can enter a lottery for tickets to see them during an open house on Oct. 25.\nMcCray says, \"The energy of many traditions and cultures has always propelled this city forward.\"\nMost of the additions come from the city's cultural institutions.\nPublic tours begin Nov. 10.\nInformation from: The Wall Street Journal, http://www.wsj.com\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:14:27.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
