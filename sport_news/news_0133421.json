The victory propelled the club to its first World Series berth since 2000. \nPLUS: The Mets are already excited about 2016 because of this player \nCespedes hurt his shoulder doing pushups at Wrigley on Wednesday, hitting coach Kevin Long said Friday. The old stadium's small, outdated gym is considered among the league's worst. \nCespedes was seen playing golf Wednesday morning, but several Mets have said he didn't suffer the injury that way. \n\"He worked out like everybody does,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said. \"He didn't tell me and I didn't ask. The cause does not mean anything when there's an injury. What causes the injury? Who cares, he's hurt. So I didn't ask him what it was. I just said he's hurt, I got to get him out. We'll get him ready for (Saturday). I know you have to have a story about why he did it but he didn't hurt it playing golf. He didn't have a bad sand shot or didn't get stuck in the side of the bunker, where it hurt him. He plays golf everyday almost so he's the same guy and that wasn't it. He either did it on a swing or a checked swing or something else.\" \nCespedes has hit two homers and driven in seven RBI in the playoffs. The Mets have said they expect him to be ready for the World Series. \nThe 30-year-old had a cortisone shot in the shoulder Thursday and is expected to attend Saturday's workout in Queens. \nBrendan Kuty may be reached at bkuty@njadvancemedia.com .
