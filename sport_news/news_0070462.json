St. Louis, which opens the postseason at home next Friday, was coming off a three-game series win at Pittsburgh that secured their third straight division title. Teheran (11-8) allowed five hits, walked one and struck out six. The right-hander closed his regular season by going 2-1 with a 1.62 ERA in his last six starts. The Cardinals had the bases loaded with no out in the fifth but came up empty when pinch-hitter John Jay grounded into a double play and Tommy Pham struck out. Jaime Garcia (10-6) gave up six hits and two runs with two walks and five strikeouts in his last start of the regular season. (Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
