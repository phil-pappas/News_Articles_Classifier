Charlie Sciretto’s interception for Portsmouth was one of many strong defensive plays that led to a scoreless first quarter. Portsmouth’s ground game picked up speed behind Jack Radcliffe and Billy Omahen, who capped Portsmouth's first scoring drive with a 15-yard touchdown run. Sixth grader Dylan Palermo converted the point after kick to make it 8-0. The Clippers added a safety, capitalizing on an errant Oyster River pitch, and closed out the first half with a 10-0 lead. Oyster River’s opening drive of the second half was stuffed when Dylan Palermo caused a fumble, giving Portsmouth great field position. Jack Connor, Radcliffe and Omahen moved the ball downfield with Omahen chalking up his second touchdown and Palermo kicking his second PAT to make it 18-0 early in the third. Portsmouth’s defense came up strong with another takeaway on Oyster River’s next drive, as Connor intercepted a pass and returned the ball to Oyster River 37. Max Lalime picked up the Portsmouth ground game with strong runs before scoring from the 4, and the Clippers took a 24-0 lead into the fourth quarter. Portsmouth iced away the shutout win with help from Lucas Guathier’s fumble recovery. Caleb Comstock capped the scoring with a 4-yard touchdown run. Little Clipper B’s cap an undefeated season The Little Clipper B’s delivered another shutout and finished the regular season undefeated with a 19-0 win over Oyster River. The Clippers will be the playoff favorite when the travel to Dover this Sunday. Portsmouth set the tone on the first drive of the game when quarterback Evan Graham connected with Cooper Roy, who turned a short pass into a 56-yard scoring play; Graham ran in the point after attempt to give his team a 7-0 lead. On Oyster River’s first possession, Gunner Jackson hauled in an interception, and back on offense on the quick change, Portsmouth’s Charlie Turner broke loose around the right side and went untouched all the way to the end zone for a 30-yard score, extending the lead to 13-0. The Clippers threatened for more after a Reece Leddy reception from Graham and a 15-yard run by Brady Kilroy, but Oyster River’s defense came up with an interception deep in its own territory for its first stop. It then threatened to score before halftime, marching to the Portsmouth 15, before Bradford Hall made a diving interception to stifle the threat as time expired. Both teams moved the ball during a scoreless third quarter. In the fourth, Portsmouth regained some traction on a 20-yard scramble by Graham. That helped set up Adam Croteau’s touchdown run that iced the victory.
