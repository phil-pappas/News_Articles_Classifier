Both teams were unbeaten in eight head-to-head meetings with divisional opponents.

That makes the team better.\" She said the whole team, varsity and junior varsity, grew close together rooting each other on. \nThe teams will compete in the Bergen County championships at Darlington Park in Mahwah tomorrow. Glen Rock is slotted into the D Division, one of five in the county event. \nGallo expects the toughest competition for the girls from Ramsey and Park Ridge/Emerson and rates Lyndhurst and Pascack Hills the teams to beat in the boys race. \nSophomore standout Alex Walter and senior Jane Burgoyne have paced the girls team. They finished 1-2 in the NJIC Colonial championships. Senior McKensie Dill has backed them up with strong finishes all season. She was eighth in the division meet (22:51) and the coach said, \"She did a great job.\" \nGallo cited the importance of Walter's consistent winning efforts throughout the season and called Burgoyne's effort in the Colonial meet \"amazing.\" She told the coach she did not want to lose to the Rutherford girl (Christie Na) and was about 30 meters behind her heading up the hill at the windup. \n\"She worked so hard,\" Gallo said, \"it was incredible to watch.\" Burgoyne passed her and came in six seconds ahead (21:22 to 21:28). \nWalter had a 20:46 clocking to continue her string of winning efforts. She paced a field of 57 runners in the race. \nSenior Lauren Boos was 17th, freshman Maggie Smith 23rd and senior Rachel Bases 31st. Glen Rock defeated Garfield for the title, 51-61. \nSenior Owen Davitt has sparked the boys team in his first time running in the fall. He was runner-up to Rutherford's three-time champion Sean Sullivan in the division race, 17:21 to 16:47. Gallo said he has taken the team along with him in his standout efforts. \nSophomore Joe McCabe was third in 17:57. Junior Hunter Somers placed 12th, senior Steven Schwartz 14th and senior Theo Grebonval 25th. Junior Matt Alport finished 36th and junior Greg Oh 53rd. \nDavitt timed 17:19 to finish eighth in the 176-runner field in the Open Division at the Shore Coaches Invitational at Holmdel County Park on Oct. 3, one of his top performances of the season. \n\"The boys have been doing well but it just wasn't our day,\" Gallo said. \nGlen Rock was edged by Garfield for the Colonial team title, 54-56. \nGallo said McCabe and Schwartz both improved and stepped up, a major reason for the boys' successful season. \nJim Jones' e-mail address is jonesji@northjersey.com Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:00:59.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
