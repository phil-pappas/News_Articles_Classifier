According to La Canfora, a decision about the game could come by Saturday, when the Eagles are expected to start heading for DC. \nIf the game's postponed, both teams would get a bye this week and then see each other on Nov. 1. The Redskins and Eagles also have a game in Philadelphia on Dec. 26. \nIf the game is postponed, it wouldn't be the first time that weather has caused a game to move.\nLast season, a Bills game that was scheduled to be played on a Sunday in Buffalo was moved to a Monday in Detroit to due a snow emergency in the Buffalo area. \n\nFedEx Field might not be hosting a game on Sunday.
