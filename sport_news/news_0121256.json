Nugent made his only two field goal attempts against the Seahawks, a 31-yarder to tie the score at 24-24 on the last play of the fourth quarter, and a 42-yarder in overtime to secure the 27-24 win. Nugent also put all five of his kickoffs in the end zone, with four of those going for touchbacks.The Special Teams Player of the Week award is Nugent’s second as a Bengal. He was named previously in Week 2 of 2010, when his five field goals provided all of Cincinnati’s points in a 15-10 win over Baltimore.The most recent Bengal to win the AFC special teams award was punter Kevin Huber, who averaged 55.5 yards on four punts in a 2013 win at San Diego (week 13).Nugent is the second Bengal this season to win a weekly AFC award from the league. Wide receiver A.J. Green was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his 227-yard, two-TD performance at Baltimore on Sept. 27.
