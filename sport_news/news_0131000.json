The Cadets (2-3, 2-1) and Blue Devils (3-2, 2-1) meet Friday in East Greenbush with serious Liberty Division seeding implications at stake.\n3 An intriguing Class C North Division encounter Friday pits surging Hoosick Falls (4-1, 3-1) at Corinth (3-2, 3-1).\n4 Green Tech senior linebacker Milton Lovelace may be small for his position (5-foot-8, 170 pounds), but he's come up big all season for the Eagles (4-1 overall, 2-1 Northwest Division). Over the past four games, Lovelace registered 16, 14, 14 and 12 tackles, respectively. Green Tech plays Friday at South Glens Falls (2-3, 1-2).\nMore Information\nContact James Allen at 518-454- 5062 or email jallen @timesunion.com\n5 A total of 77 undefeated teams remain in New York, 12 from Section II.
