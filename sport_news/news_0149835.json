Jin, who led after the opening two rounds, had a 54-hole total of 11-under 199 at Clearwater Bay. Australian amateur champion Cameron Davis and countryman Ryan Ruffels, the highest-ranked amateur in the field at No. 8, were one behind after 67s. Winds picked up late in the day, toppling a crane used for TV coverage, but there were no reports of injuries. The weather forecast for Sunday was for storms and continuing high winds and the threat of a typhoon, forcing organizers to tell players in a statement that if the fourth round is not played, the 54-hole scores would determine the winner. Tee times for Sunday were in threesomes off two tees, with the last groups off at 8:30 a.m. \"We needed to make as much of a move as we could today, and if we get a chance tomorrow to play, then great,\" Davis said. Ruffels added: \"Our coaches told us that conditions were going to be pretty average tomorrow. It would have been great to be sitting at the top after 54.\" Yu Chun-an (67) of Taiwan and South Korea's Kim Tae-ho (69), were tied for fourth, three behind. Defending champion Antonio Murdaca of Australia, who won last year at Royal Melbourne , shot 64 to move into sixth place, four off the lead. Guan Tianlang of China, the 2012 champion, shot 74 Saturday and was well off the pace at 5-over, tied for 47th and 16 strokes behind. The tournament champion receives an invitation to next year's Masters. The champion and runner-up receive a place in the final round of qualifying for the 2016 British Open at Royal Troon .
