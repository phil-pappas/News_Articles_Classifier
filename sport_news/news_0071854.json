On Tuesday night, Mets second baseman Daniel Murphy slammed his fifth home run in his fifth consecutive post-season game, leaving his manager, Terry Collins, in awe.\"I've watched a lot of baseball over the years. I don't think I've seen anybody put on this kind of a show on this stage like he has so far,\" Collins said.The Mets also got a strong pitching performance from Jacob deGrom, who gave up four hits in seven innings.But after the win Tuesday at Wrigley Field, Collins said his players aren't looking ahead to the World Series.\"We've got to get ready to play,\" the Mets manager said.Meanwhile, on the Cubs side, Joe Maddon is trying to balance his team's elimination fears and comeback hopes.\"It's up to us to go out there and play and perform and execute. I really put all my stock and faith in the fact that I know our guys are ready to play,\" Maddon, the manager for the Cubs, said.Game 4 is Wednesday at Wrigley Field. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
