Truman boys soccer coach Jared Byrne wasn’t exactly happy with the way his team played, but he’ll take it. Despite holding a sizable advantage in shots and missing opportunities on William Chrisman’s side of the field, the Patriots (14-3) managed to squeak by with a 1-0 home win against their Noland Road rivals Wednesday. “I am pleased we got the win, but we needed to finish that game,” Byrne said. “We needed to get some more goals in there. We got a little selfish in the offensive third. I thought we moved the ball well in the back and the middle-third, but when we got to the end of the box, we tried to do too much individually.” The game was played at the Bears’ pace, a team that thrives in low-scoring games and commits a lot of its players to the defensive side. The Chrisman defense made it difficult for the Truman forwards to get shots off as it frequently deflected shots and cleared six of Truman’s eight corner kicks. That, combined with several Patriot players trying to dribble a lot in the box then get a shot off limited their opportunities to score during a game they outshot the Bears 12-5. “I was very pleased with how well we played today,” Chrisman coach John Straub said. “I thought as the game went along, we loosened up and played a little bit better.” The one shot the Bears let go through happened just six minutes in the game. After a Collin McClaran corner kick, a Truman player attempted a shot only for the ball to be deflected by a Bears defender. Luckily for the Patriots, Keaton Wiley was there to put in the rebound as he banged it just inside the right post for the score. “We didn’t get a lot of chances and that was the one that got lucky and got in,” Wiley said. “It was especially a good goal against a rival like this one.” Chrisman (7-9-1) managed to create a few chances during the last 20 minutes of the first half. The best chance came from a long direct free kick from Marco Sagastume that looked like it might bend inside the far post, but goalkeeper Carter Higgins was there to make second of his two saves on the night. “Carter is not a tall guy, but he was able to get up there and get that one,” Byrne said. Higgins didn’t have to work hard in the second half as his team possessed the ball throughout the majority of it and the Bears’ only shot attempt came with four minutes left when fired into a thicket of defenders and the ball was easily collected by the Truman senior. Page 2 of 2 - “We tried to possess the ball a little bit,” Straub said, “and slow things down. Truman did a good job with their counter attack which made us a little cautious about sending too many players forward. Added Higgins: “Our defense played really good. We had a few mistakes back there, but overall we played smart.” By Michael Smith", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:52:09.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
