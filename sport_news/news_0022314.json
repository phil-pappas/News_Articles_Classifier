He doesn't make a single point related to why we as a society are gradually seeing the merits of abolishing legalized killing of prisoners.\nModern civilization can do better than simply exacting revenge. Capital punishment is not a deterrent; innocents get executed (perhaps none yet in Oregon?) â€” an irreversible condition.\nIf the Oregon Constitution is indeed (as Marquis suggests) so flawed as to render effective sentence-reduction decisions impossible for those already incarcerated, we should also amend it to repair such a defect. Marquis' kudos for the draconian Measure 11 is as unsurprising as it is irrelevant to his opinion piece. Conviction records are enhanced for some district attorneys through their use of plea-bargain bludgeons unhindered by statutory limits.\nRobert E.
