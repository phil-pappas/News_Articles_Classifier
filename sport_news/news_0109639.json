The two were inseparable, from their time overseas to back at home in Wyoming.\n“He was my brother. Everywhere I went, he was right there. He was doing his job as a service animal,” Bessler said.\nBoth Bessler and Mike were retired from the service due to post traumatic stress disorder. Bessler adopted Mike after their last deployment, and his wartime partner became his service dog as they battled life after combat.\n“He helped me through a lot of different situations and a lot of different emotional times.” Bessler said of Mike.\nBessler lost his best friend and brother when Mike was shot and killed by a bicyclist. Like any story, there are two sides. The man who shot Mike believed he was  being attacked.\n“I was paralyzed. I was shocked. I’m still in shock, anger, sadness, pain,” Bessler said of the loss of Mike.\nAnd now, he wants to honor his fellow soldier by giving him a proper veteran burial with military honors. However, military dogs aren’t entitled to receive military honors - a policy Bessler is hoping to change.\n“He’s retired just like I’m retired,” he said. “I’ll receive military honors. I’m a veteran. He’s a veteran...dog.”\nAs he pushes for change, Bessler said he just needs time to grieve.\n“there are a number of other veterans out there that are looking for dogs, and they need them,” he said.\nAfter Mike was retired, he was promoted to Major. And even though he wasn’t on the front lines, his service never stopped.\nThrough the help of a Go Fund Me page , over $14,000 was raised in less than a week to give him a funeral worthy of a hero, to be held Nov. 11 at the Power cemetery.\nCopyright 2015 KTWO via CNN.
