Czerwonka said the match was the toughest she's played in high school.\n\"It was a fight; the whole entire thing was a battle,\" Czerwonka said. \"I think the difference was I had a little bit extra to go and pushed myself a little more. I nailed my shots and wanted it so bad. She played amazing, too.\"\nPiaskowski, who also finished third at state in 2013, had strung together wins against Czerwonka during the regular season. At the state tournament, it has been a different story, but the senior said Saturday's championship came down to a few points and consistency.\n\"It couldn't have been any closer,\" Piaskowski said. \"There wasn't much more I could have done; she outplayed me. It was a good, close match.\"\nThe Fitbit fitness tracker wrapped around Czerwonka's wrist lost power at 30,000-plus steps after the junior's 2-6, 7-6 (8), 6-2 win over Veda Sane, a University School freshman, in the semifinals on Saturday morning.\nBut outlasting Piaskowski was the ultimate goal for Czerwonka, the tournament's No. 2 seed who finished the season with a 28-1 record.\n\"I had to focus and I just had to think one more point, one more point,\" Czerwonka said.\nIn Division 1 singles, Stevens Point junior Emily Luetschwager ousted Dao Sysouvanh of Sun Prairie, 6-2, 6-4, to take home the state championship and maintain an undefeated season with a 34-0 record. Luetschwager dispatched Homestead's Katya Mikhailenko earlier Saturday in the semifinals, 6-2, 6-2.\nMeanwhile, the top podium spots in state doubles showcased the transformation and success of competitors with singles backgrounds.\nRiley Strauss and Caroline Taylor of University School clinched the Division 2 doubles title with a 6-1, 7-5 victory over Madison Edgewood's Abby Fox and Maddie Molitor.\nTaylor realized she would move down the Wildcats singles ladder due to Sane's talents, and said she switched to doubles to \"play higher\" during her senior year. Partnering with Strauss, a sophomore, was a no-brainer since the teammates share a similar work ethic.\n\"We put in the extra time,\" Taylor said. \"We played after practice, we played with other coaches and we set up matches with guys from other high schools. That definitely helped us.\"\nUniversity School coach Andy Paley said watching the pair learn the rhythm and movement of doubles during the course of the season has been an interesting experience. Being able to adapt to momentum shifts in matches has been critical to their success.\n\"They both love to fight,\" Paley said. \"Caroline is a hacker at the net and Riley, being a lefty with her serve and her ground strokes, they put the package together. They always try to change the rhythm and never try to be predictable.\"\nIn Division 1 doubles, Abbey Webber and Kaisey Skibba of Middleton bested Nicolet's Elise Gerard and Annabelle Crowley, 6-1, 6-1, to earn the state championship.\nSkibba, who was a state qualifier for three years at singles, was competing in doubles for the first time. Gerard, a Nicolet junior, made the move after two seasons, and hopes to be partnered with Crowley, who is a freshman, again next year.\nDespite the title loss, Gerard said she walked away from state with a positive experience.\n\"They knew everything we were going to do and were just so smart,\" Gerard said of Webber and Skibba. \"We were the (No.) four seed, and I'm really happy we got to the finals.\"\nRESULTS DIVISION 1 Championship singles Emily Luetschwager, Stevens Point, def.
