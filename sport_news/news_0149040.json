Tre Threat , LB, Spanish Fort (6-2, 235, Senior) \nThe longtime Auburn commit seems to be fully healthy again after an early-season leg injury cost him some time. In a win over Baldwin County last week, he had five tackles and a 43-yard fumble return for a touchdown. Threat and his teammates will need another good performance on Friday against a high-scoring Blount offense. \n2. Velus Jones , WR, Saraland (5-11, 181, Senior) \nJones, who committed to Southern Cal this spring, had his best game of the year against Citronelle last week. He caught eight passes for 230 yards and four scores. The TD plays covered 13, 59, 56 and 45 yards. He and sophomore quarterback Jack West seem to be developing a nice rhythm in the second half of the season. The Spartans travel to Baldwin County on Friday. \n3. Deangelo Anderson , LB, Blount (6-3, 215, Senior) \nAs good as the Blount offense has been, the Leopard defense has been strong as well. Blount has limited its opponents to approximately 12 points a game. Anderson and his physical style of play has been a key to that. The Leopards will have their hands full with high-scoring Spanish Fort this weekend. For Blount to stay unbeaten, Anderson and his fellow linebackers must have a good game. \n4. Tanner Allen , QB, UMS-Wright (5-10, 160, Junior) \nPut an asterisk by this name. Allen is an LSU baseball commit, and his future clearly is in that sport. However, his play on the football field this year shouldn’t be ignored. In last week’s 48-0 rout of Thomasville, Allen was an efficient 8-of-9 for 202 yards and three touchdowns. His Class 4A top-ranked Bulldogs host Southside-Selma this Friday. \n5. Kendric Haynes , LB, Murphy (6-0, 224, Junior) \nHaynes, who has SEC offers from Kentucky, South Carolina and LSU already, is the heart of the Panthers’ defense for the third straight season. Though he missed a game earlier this year because of injury, he is second on the team in tackles with 56 and has four tackles for loss. As always, he will be a big part of the plan as Murphy (4-2, 4-0) hosts Foley (5-2, 3-2) in another big Class 7A, Region 1 game Thursday. \nWEEK 8 COASTAL ALABAMA FOOTBALL SCHEDULE \nTHURSDAY", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:10:00.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
