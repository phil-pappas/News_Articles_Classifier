(Photo: USA TODAY Sports) \nPISCATAWAY, N.J. — The idea, according to Mark Dantonio, was to get through Saturday’s game at Rutgers with Madre London and Gerald Holmes handling the running duties. \nBut the second half came down to LJ Scott and Delton Williams. And there’s no telling when starter London will be back on the field for the Spartans. \nOne of the few MSU position groups that has been able to avoid injuries this season now has a big one. And Williams, on course to redshirt as a junior after a long offseason suspension, will be active for the No. 4 Spartans (6-0, 2-0 Big Ten) after his debut in Saturday’s 31-24 win at Rutgers. \n“I just felt like first of all he’s been unbelievable in terms of in the locker room, an emotional leader and has just been extremely positive,” Dantonio said of activating Williams in the second half after London went down with a right ankle injury. “He’s done everything he needs to do. When we lost Madre I felt like we needed a lift emotionally as much as anything. And now he enters a situation as the third back if Madre can’t go, and I just felt like there’s things he can do to help this team win this year. \n“So that’s what I was waiting for, if we had to go in that direction. But it gives us another big, quality back. Physical running back. So we’ll see how Madre is, but at least at this point in time, we needed him for this game.” MSU happy to have quality, depth at running back \nWilliams had just two carries for 6 yards, while true freshman Scott handled the key possession of the game. Dantonio said MSU “tried to hold him out” because of a knee injury that made it so Scott “didn’t practice much this week.” \nBut Scott entered the game right after London went down and scored a touchdown. He later scored the winning touchdown with 43 seconds left, on a drive that saw him gain 37 of his 42 yards on the night. \n“I knew I was gonna play, I just didn’t know when I was getting in,” Scott said. “I’m fine, I just got banged up a little bit and missed practice. … When I got in, I just wanted to be a game changer.” \nHolmes ran well early with five carries for 37 yards, but he didn’t get a second-half attempt. There’s no indication how Williams and Holmes might split carries moving forward, but Scott is the likely starter and has been MSU’s best back through half of the regular season. \nLondon iced the right ankle for much of the second half and left on crutches, and Scott said of him: “He’s doing good. He’ll bounce back. He’s going through adversity right now but he’ll bounce back.” \nOf the return of Williams, Scott said: “I know how bad he wanted to be in there, and he was facing adverse times as well, so I was happy for him.” MSU 6-0 entering U-M week after latest escape act \nThe list grows : If senior quarterback Connor Cook’s unofficial injury report is correct, left tackle Jack Conklin (knee) and tight end Josiah Price (ankle) will return Saturday at Michigan after both missed a second straight game. \nAnd though Cook wasn’t sure of the severity of the right leg injury suffered late by Jack Allen – who could barely put weight on the leg – Cook said: “He’ll probably end up playing, too.” \nLondon and Allen were joined by cornerback Darian Hicks on the injured list, with Hicks taking a shot to the head in the second quarter and not returning. He was receiving concussion tests on the sideline. \nMSU also lost defensive end Lawrence Thomas late, though his injury did not look serious. It’s unclear whether kickoff specialist Kevin Cronin and punter Jake Hartbarger were injured or just replaced. Michael Geiger kicked off for Cronin and hooked the kick out of bounds. \nBackup quarterback Tyler O’Connor punted late for Hartbarger and placed a perfect pooch punt at the Rutgers 5-yard line. \nMSU did get receiver Macgarrett Kings Jr. and fullback Trevon Pendleton back from undisclosed injuries. And starting tackle Kodi Kieler also returned after a knee injury that knocked him from MSU’s Sept. 12 win over Oregon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T10:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:48:14.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
