(Photo: Lloyd Gallman/Advertiser) \nTROY — For as much pride as they have over their past wins over Southeastern Conference schools, the Troy Trojans should bury their heads in shame over their recent history. \nIt hasn’t been pretty. \nTroy’s game Saturday at Mississippi State marks the fourth time in the last three years the Trojans have lined up with an SEC school. \nThe combined score of the last three: 179-28. \n“It will be a great game to show what I can do and what I’m made of,” Troy offensive lineman Dalton Bennett said. “They are SEC athletes, and I guess that’s a cut above everyone wants to think, but I think there’s just as talented people in conferences like the Sun Belt as there are in the SEC and those top five. \n“I’m looking forward to it. I know the team is.” Troy offensive lineman Dalton Bennett will face Mississippi State for the third time in his career Saturday. Stacy Long The embarrassment remains from Troy’s last trip to Mississippi State. \nIt was 2013 and a 10-7 second-quarter deficit quickly devolved into a 45-7 halftime hole. The stadium was practically deserted by the last tick of a 62-7 final. \n“I watched a little bit of it (on TV),” said Brandon Silvers, today’s Troy starting quarterback who was redshirting in 2013 and didn’t make the trip. \n“I really didn’t watch the second half of that game.” \nMSU’s Dak Prescott, then a mere sophomore, ran for two touchdowns, threw for one and caught a pass for another. All in the second quarter. \nThat day, the Bulldogs averaged almost 7.8 yards per play. \n“It wasn’t what we wanted it to be, at all,” Troy defensive end Tyler Roberts said. “I guess that is in the back of my mind and a couple of people who played in that game, too. \n“We’ll be thinking about that game a lot this week as we prepare.” Troy defensive end Tyler Roberts vividly remembers the Trojans losing 62-7 at Mississippi State in 2013. Stacy Long \nTroy counts a 2001 win at Mississippi State and a 2004 home win over Missouri as two of its significant victories. \nIt considers a 30-24 home loss to Mississippi State in 2012 big because it was the first time an SEC school had visited Troy. (In 2004, Missouri was a member of the Big 12.) \n“It’s going to be my third time playing them. Yes, I’ve been here that long,” Bennett said. “Whenever they came here (in 2012), it was a great game. We took them down to the wire. We just didn’t have the depth that they had. \n“The next year, we went to Starkville. Of course, it was a tough atmosphere — their hometown, their crowd, they’re playing their best game at home — and it didn’t go how we wanted.” \nLater in 2013, the Trojans gave up 751 yards offense in a 51-21 loss at Ole Miss. Last year, they took a 66-0 beating at Georgia. \n“I just want to go out there and give it my all,” Troy linebacker Terris Lewis said. “Our defense is way better than it was two years ago. I say, if everybody goes out there and communicates and does their jobs, I think we’ll stick around and have a chance to whup ‘em.” Troy quarterback Brandon Silvers says the Trojans must stay relaxed when playing in a high-intensity Southeastern Conference environment, like they will Saturday at Mississippi State.
