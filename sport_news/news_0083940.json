Traffic will be heaviest around the stadium between 4 p.m. until 6 p.m., Arizona Cardinals spokesman Mark Dalton said. \nTraffic updates are available at www.AZ511.gov , and also by dialing 511 from any landline or mobile phone from anywhere in Arizona. \nFans are reminded to bring a canned food item or make a monetary donation for the Cardinals' annual food drive benefiting St. Mary's Food Bank . \nPlaying on the road is nothing new to the Ravens this year as they have been away from home for four of their six games. Their record isn't what Baltimore fans have been used to as the Ravens are 1-5. That said, every game has been close. They have not lost a game by more than six points. \nThe Cardinals stand on top of the NFC West with a record of 4-2 and every win has been a blowout. On the defensive side of things, the Cardinals top the NFL with 11 interceptions while the Ravens, always known for their defense, have just three. This is just the sixth time these teams have met with Baltimore leading the series 4-1. The last time they faced off was four years ago when the Ravens pulled off the biggest comeback in team history. After trailing 24-3 in the second quarter they won 30-27. West Valley commuters: Keep in mind that the NFL game tonight begins at 5:30. That could mean extra traffic on your way home.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T17:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:39:56.147+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
