San Jose State Spartans quarterback Kenny Potter (5) runs with the ball against the New Hampshire Wildcats' in the second quarter at Spartan Stadium in San Jose, Calif., on Thursday, Sept. 3, 2015. (Josie Lepe/Bay Area News Group) ( Josie Lepe ) \nJoe Gray, the 2014 starter, has performed so well in Potter's absence that a change at this point risks disrupting the Spartans' rhythm at a crucial stretch in the season. \nCoach Ron Caragher knows which player will start Saturday but is mum on the subject. Because Gray (pocket passer) and Potter (dual threat) have different styles, secrecy could be advantageous -- the Rebels don't know what's coming. \n\"It will be based on where we stand with the guy who gives us the best chance to win,'' offensive coordinator Al Borges said. \nWhat does that mean, exactly? \nCaragher explained that the evaluation of Gray and Potter went far deeper than completion percentage and touchdown ratio. Advertisement \nInstead, the offensive staff examined each quarterback's decisions on every play in practice and games: When to hand off and when to keep the ball, making the proper reads, throwing to the correct receiver based on the coverage, putting the ball in the right window, and more. \n\"It's not a mathematical formula,'' Caragher said. \"But it's about good decisions.'' \nGray has made plenty of them lately. The uptick in his efficiency coincides with Borges calling the games from the sideline (as opposed to the coaches' box), where he can have face-to-face conversations with Gray. \nIn the two games with Borges on the sideline and Potter unable to play, Gray has completed 73.2 percent of his passes for 476 yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions -- neither of which was his fault. \n\"There's no question,\" Borges said, that Gray has made the decision more difficult. \n\"He's had a rhythm. There used to be three of four plays a game when you'd say, 'Joe, what were you thinking?' But the last two weeks, that hasn't been a factor. That's a sign that he's growing.''
