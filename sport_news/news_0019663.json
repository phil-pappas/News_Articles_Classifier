Dallas was all-in with free agent center DeAndre Jordan, who infamously reneged on his agreement to join the Mavericks, instead resigning with the Clippers.\nChandler, who was perhaps Dallas' best alternative to Jordan, agreed to join the Suns early on in free agency. It was an all-too familiar feeling for Chandler, who left Dallas after just one year after helping the Mavericks win the 2010-11 championship.\n\"I definitely felt like, after winning a championship and help bring it there, that I was going to be there for the long run,\" said Chandler, according to the Arizona Republic . \"I never heard of a championship team being broken up like that. When they traded for me to come back, I sat at the podium with everybody else and heard them say this was going to be a long-term deal and they weren't going to make the same mistake as last time and blah-blah-blah.\n\"Seven months later, the same thing happens again. But I learned in this business that you can't trust everybody. That's why it is what it is.\"\nMavericks owner Mark Cuban said earlier this month Chandler has \"a right to be salty because I really did suggest to him that I thought he'd be here for a long time.\"\nCuban said Chandler's agent gave the Mavericks an ultimatum this summer, and the center wouldn't wait until the Jordan saga played out. Cuban also said they discussed an extension at the start of the year, but it \"kind of just died on the vine.\"\nChandler had his retort ready Tuesday.\n\"I saw the bull---- they put out,\" Chandler said, according to the Arizona Republic. \"It's just bull----. Just saving face. It was what it was. It was clear. The whole process was going on while I was basically still in the jersey.\"\nThe Mavericks host the Suns at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday in a preseason game, then visit Phoenix for the season-opener at 9 p.m. Oct. 28.\n\"To be honest, I don't know what my emotions are going to be like going in there until I get there,\" Chandler told the newspaper. \"I feel like the whole situation was all bad -- twice.\"\nClick here to read the Arizona Republic's full story.\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW", "http://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/nba/suns/2015/10/20/tyson-chandler-visits-dallas-after-being-spurned-twice/74308952/"], "published": "2015-10-21T18:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:16:15.327+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
