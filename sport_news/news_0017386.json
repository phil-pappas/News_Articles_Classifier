Also unlike the Jays, who are built around the power hitters in the middle of their lineup, the Royals win primarily with pitching and defence, while scratching out runs with speed and timely hits.\nHere is a closer look at how they ended up with the best record in the AL.\nDeep Bullpen\nDespite losing closer Greg Holland to Tommy John surgery in the final month of the season, the Royals still boast one of the best bullpens in baseball. Wade Davis, who had been the setup man for Holland and has now taken over the closer’s role, was already the better reliever and arguably the best bullpen arm in baseball two years running. His 0.94 ERA is the best in the game, while his strikeout rate (31 per cent) is 10th among AL relievers. But he’s not the only weapon in the Royals’ bullpen, which collectively posted a 2.72 ERA this year — nearly a half-run better than any other team. Kelvin Herrera and Ryan Madson were also among the league’s top relievers, while Luke Hochevar, Kris Medlen and Danny Duffy give the ’pen added depth.\nStingy Defence\nIt’s no secret the Royals are the best defensive team in baseball. What the Blue Jays are to scoring runs, the Royals are to preventing them. Their defensive Wins Above Replacement are nearly twice that of the second-best team. They are solid everywhere on the diamond, but where the Royals save the most runs is in the outfield, where the Gold Glove combination of Alex Gordon in left and Lorenzo Cain in centre cover ground like few others. Former Jay Alex Rios, who gets most of the starts in right, is not going to make many highlight reels with his glove. But in late innings he is replaced by Jarrod Dyson, who is among the best defensive outfielders in baseball. Jays’ manager John Gibbons, a former bench coach of the Royals, said the team was built for Kauffman Stadium’s expansive outfield: “A big part of their success is they flag the ball down, because a lot of teams can’t, because the outfield is so big here.”\nThey don’t strike out\nCollectively, the Royals struck out far less frequently than any other team, posting a major-league-best 15.9-per-cent strikeout rate — nearly five points below the league average. Not striking out doesn’t mean you’re necessarily scoring more — the Royals ranked middle of the pack in the American League in terms of runs scored — but putting balls in play does put more pressure on the opposing defence. The Royals have four hitters (Ben Zobrist, Alcides Escobar, Mike Moustakas and Salvador Perez) among the league’s top 25 in terms of lowest strikeout rates.\nTimely hits\nThe Blue Jays were the most successful team in the majors this season at hitting with runners in scoring position, but the Royals were next best, posting a .282 batting average with runners on second or third. With men on base, the Royals also ranked second to the Jays, while in so-called “high leverage” situations — when leads can change hands and the game hangs in the balance — the Royals ranked a close third behind the Jays and Oakland A’s. Part of their success in these situations comes from their hitters’ high-contact rate, but they also boast good situational hitters. Four different Royals hit .300 or better with runners in scoring position, while Lorenzo Cain led the majors with a .444 batting average in high-leverage situations.\nStrong start, strong finish\nAs if carrying the momentum from last season’s remarkable run to the World Series, the Royals stormed out of the gate this year, winning their first seven games to put themselves in the driver’s seat in the AL Central. They won two-thirds of their games in April to take an early lead in the division. They fell back to earth a bit as the season wore on, but, like the Jays, went on another tear in August, winning 19 of 28 games. Just as they started the season, the Royals finished it with a winning streak, taking their last five games to lock up the league’s top spot.\nMore on thestar.com\nToronto Blue Jays’ playlist features Drake, Phil Collins and Kendrick Lamar\nSecond Step is early favourite at Canadian International", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:24:44.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
