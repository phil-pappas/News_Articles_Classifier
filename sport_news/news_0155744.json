The Kings terminated his contract later in the summer, and the NHLPA filed a grievance on his behalf. \nRichards had five years and $22 million remaining on a lavish 12-year, $69 million deal signed with Philadelphia. The two-time Stanley Cup champion’s offensive production declined sharply the past few years. \nTerms of the settlement weren’t disclosed by the union or the team. The Kings issued a brief statement declaring the settlement “agreeable to all parties.” \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:28:43.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
