They are a special group of young ladies. I can’t ask for anything else.” \nThe game ended on a sour note for Trinity when senior Chasey Mitchell was carried off late in the fourth set with what Herrera called a knee injury. \nIt was the fourth meeting this year between the GISA Region 1-AAA rivals, with the Lady Warriors winning for the third time including in the region championship. \nThe Lady Lions were led offensively by junior Cheyenne Hayes throughout the day. \nBefore getting hurt late in the game, Mitchell helped keep several points alive with her defensive effort. \nSenior libero Kelsey Richards also turned in a solid effort with some impressive digs. \nSeniors Peyton Lohlein, Libby Rogers, Jones, Mitchell, and Richards helped turn the Lady Lions into a dynasty. \n“They mean so much, they have helped establish the program,” said Herrera, who closed his first season as head coach with a 32-5 record after taking over the coaching reigns from Joe Camp this season. \nIn the first set, Oak Mountain jumped out front 22-16 before Hayes brought the Lady Lions back with a kill. \nTrinity got as close as two points when Ava Taylor put a shot away and trimmed the lead to 23-21. \nTrinity took control of the second set early, and led 17-10 before Oak Mountain made a run. \nThe Lady Warriors trimmed the lead to 23-21, before Trinity was able to close out the match. \nTrinity and Oak Mountain traded leads in the third set with the Lady Lions building a 12-10 lead. \nOak Mountain, however, fought back to take a 15-14 lead at never trailed again to build a 2-1 set advantage in the match. \nAfter pulling away 7-6 in the fourth set, Oak Mountain never trailed again and to secure its state title. \nOak Mountain’s Bret Luther and Kendall Washington led the way for the Lady Warriors. \nAgainst Heritage, the Lady Lions exchanged the lead four times in the first set with Heritage building its largest lead at 8-5, before Trinity ral- lied back to eventually tie the game at 9-9. \nThe Lady Lions took the lead for good when they pulled out to an 10-9 lead. \nTrinity eventually pulled out to a five-point lead twice at 14-9 lead 16-11 before Heritage l stormed back to tie the game for a final time at 20-20. The two teams traded points the rest of the way before the Lady Lions secured the win. \nThe second set was nearly a repeat of the first set with the two teams exchanging the momentum early. After five ties, including the final one at 8-all, the Lady Lions took their first lead of the match at 9-8. \nThe Lady Lions extended the margin to 18-13, but the Lady Hawks went on a 6-0 run to grab a 19-18 lead. \nHeritage had a chance to tie the match at a set apiece when it went up 21-19, but Trinity scored the next six points. \nThe Lady Lions dominated the third set leading from start to finish and after build- ing its first double-digit lead at 14-4 the set was never in doubt. \n“I thought we played really hard against a very good Trinity team,” Heritage head coach Mary Louise Hunt said. \nIt was the last high school volleyball match for Heritage seniors Morgan Tiernan, Dottie Hall and Hallie Hunt. \n“I am going to miss the seniors,” Hunt said. “They have worked really hard.” More", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:27:27.939+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
