After that the Seahawks made the somewhat rare move to have Richard Sherman cover Green solely. Sherman usually lines up on the left side of the defense and covers whoever is across from him.\nSEAHAWKS AT BENGALS » Photo gallery Full coverage Pete Carroll 'baffled' after late collapse Larry Stone: Seahawks must regain ability to close out games Seahawks again fail to hold late lead Web reaction: Fans, media on Seahawks' 'devastating' loss to Bengals Grades: Low marks for Seahawks' late struggles on both sides of ball Neil deGrasse Tyson gives 'scientific' explanation for Seahawks' loss Full game highlights Rawls scores on 69-yard TD run Matt Calkins: Marshawn Lynch may go from Beast Mode to Decreased Mode The Seahawk made the move after Green beat Williams for a 72-yard touchdown that was nullified due to a holding penalty.\nWilliams said he wasn’t offended.\n“It didn’t matter to me,’’ said Williams, in his first year with the team after signing a three-year, $18 million contract in the offseason. “At the end of the day I’m called upon to do a job. Whatever they ask me to do I do, and it was the situation that we had, and I was as comfortable as I could be out there.\n“I played as well as I possibly could. I didn’t play as well as I wanted to. But it’s the NFL and you just make adjustments and you look at the film and you assess yourself and you get back to fundamentals and try to get better next week.’’\nCarroll said he thought Williams “bounced back’’ after the move.\nStill, Williams was flagged for pass interference on Cincinnati’s final drive in regulation, resulting in a 27-yard gain that moved the ball into Seahawks territory and set up the tying field goal. Williams was trying to defend a pass to Marvin Jones. Williams was also called for a pass interference in the third quarter, also on Jones, that resulted in 29 yards. But the Bengals did not score on that drive.\nCarroll said, “I didn’t think either one was a penalty.’’\nSaid Williams: “Those are the calls that you’ve got to respect, so you go about it and move on to the next play.’’\nWhere’s Thomas? Fans might have been surprised not to see running back Thomas Rawls on the field for the Seahawks’ first possession of overtime. They got the ball first after winning the coin toss, and had they scored a touchdown the game would have been over. The Seahawks, though, could move only 18 yards in six plays before punting. All came with Rawls, who had a game-high 169 yards rushing, on the bench.\nCarroll said the team went with Fred Jackson for that drive because it was going to more of the plays in its hurry-up package.\n“We just hustled-up the mode and changed the mode like we often do,’’ he said.\nRawls came back in for the second series and confirmed later he wasn’t injured.\n“The game isn’t all about me,’’ he said. “There’s a reason why Fred Jackson is out there. I trust this organization, I trust the big boys up front, and we are just trying to get better.’’\nShead takes blame Some pointed later to a 35-yard punt return by Cincinnati’s Adam Jones early in the fourth quarter as a shift in momentum. The Seahawks led 24-7 at the time, but Jones’ return to the 33-yard line set up a quick touchdown drive that started the Bengals’ comeback.\nSeattle safety DeShawn Shead took the blame for the play. Shead had a chance to get Jones down in the open field at about the Cincinnati 38, but Jones got away.\n“It was my fault,’’ Shead said. “I missed a tackle on that. I take full responsibility. I should have tackled him down, and we would have had better field position. I feel like that gave them the momentum that they needed.’’\nSaid Carroll: “I don’t think we had a great ball (punt) on that one.’’\nBut Carroll also pointed to the play as an example that everybody shared in the blame for the blown lead.\n“It’s across the board,’’ he said.\nWagner, Hill injured The Seahawks suffered two injuries of note, as middle linebacker Bobby Wagner left for a few plays in the fourth quarter because of a strained pectoral muscle and defensive tackle Jordan Hill sat out the second half because of a quad strain.\nWagner downplayed the injury. “It happened somewhere in the fourth quarter. I just tried to play through it.’’\nNote • The Seahawks were dealing with a tough turnaround, having played Detroit on Monday night and then making the trip for what is one of only three 10 a.m. Seattle times starts this season (St. Louis and Minnesota the other). But Carroll said he didn’t think fatigue was a factor.\n“I didn’t think that,’’ he said. “We really took care of the guys. I thought we would feel stronger as we finished because of the week that we had and they were seeming fresh throughout the game. I’m surprised that didn’t factor into our favor.’’\nBob Condotta: 206-515-5699 or bcondotta@seattletimes.com .
