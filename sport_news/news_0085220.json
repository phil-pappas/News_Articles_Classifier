Enunwa, a 2014 sixth-round pick, was accused of causing injury to his girlfriend by “ grabbing the victim by her ankle and pulling her off a bed and causing her to strike and injure both her head and finger,” according to the criminal complaint.\nThe woman later decided not to pursue the charges.\nBut the NFL must have felt there was enough there to suspend him. His suspension begins immediately. He is eligible to return to the team on Nov. 13, the day after they play the Bills.\n“We support and respect the NFL’s decision to suspend Quincy Enunwa,” the Jets said in a statement.\n“The New York Jets share the NFL’s ongoing commitment to raising awareness of the frequency and impact of domestic and relationship violence, supporting survivors, and encouraging others to speak out and seek help.”\nEnunwa had played 50 percent of the team’s offensive snaps this year. He has eight catches for 94 yards.\n \n  Filed under new york jets ,  quincy enunwa", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:43:38.138+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
