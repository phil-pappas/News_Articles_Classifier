So it’s something that I’ve just got to keep on doing and just be consistent each week.”\nUtah QB Travis Wilson\nSALT LAKE CITY — Utah’s tight end situation is now a little tighter. On Monday, head coach Kyle Whittingham announced that starter Siale Fakailoatonga is out for the season because of injury.\n“It’s unfortunate,” Whittingham said. “We’ll miss him.”\nFakailoatonga was tied for fourth on the team with 12 receptions for 120 yards.\nThe junior stepped into the starting role when Evan Moeai was sidelined for the year with an injury in the season opener.\nWhittingham declined to give an update on starting linebacker Jared Norris, who like Fakailoatonga, was injured in last Saturday’s 34-18 win over Arizona State. The coach cited his policy of not commenting on injuries that aren’t season ending.\n“So we don’t have anything to say about anybody else,” Whittingham said as the third-ranked Utes prepare for Saturday’s game at USC .\nSophomore Harrison Handley now tops the depth chart at tight end. Freshman Caleb Repp is listed as the backup.\nWHAT TO EXPECT: Whittingham hasn’t seen, nor does he expect to, a lot of changes from the Trojans since interim coach Clay Helton replaced the fired Steve Sarkisian last week.\n“It’s midseason, you’re not going to make wholesale changes at this point in the year,” Whittingham said. “They’re going to continue to operate very similar to how they have in the first of the season, in our opinion.”\nMOVING ON UP: Starting quarterback Travis Wilson continues to climb the charts. The senior is one win away from pulling into a tie with Alex Smith for the most career wins as a starter at Utah with 21. He’s also one game from matching Brian Johnson ’s school record of 33 career starts at quarterback.\n“It’s definitely a big accomplishment,” Wilson said. “I’m really happy I’ve been playing well this season and taking care of the football. So it’s something that I’ve just got to keep on doing and just be consistent each week.”\nTHAT SPECIAL MISTAKE: Utah’s failed kickoff return that resulted in an illegal forward pass and a safety Saturday would have worked, Whittingham insists, if executed properly.\n“It was a touchdown, without question,” he said after studying the film, “But if you don’t execute it you’re idiots and if you do, you get to go on a speaking circuit and write a book about it and all that stuff. So it’s feast or famine.”\nIn hindsight, Whittingham said he wishes they hadn’t done it because it didn’t work out. However, it was flawless in practice.\nEven so, Whittingham acknowledged they need to do a better job of coaching it to make it a success in games.\nEXTRA POINTS: Whittingham said is expecting a “good battle” in practice this week between Chase Hansen and Jason Thompson for playing time at safety. Hansen will still remain the No. 3 quarterback . . . Senior receiver Tim Patrick is back on the depth chart as a backup. He’s played in just one game this season because of injury . . . After defeating Arizona State, Utes have now beaten every team in the Pac-12 except Washington since joining the conference in 2011.\nEmail: dirk@desnews.com\nTwitter: @DirkFacer", "external_links": ["http://img.youtube.com/vi/bAcK6zv2zAY/0.jpg", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865639377%26content-category%3Dutah-utes%2Csports%2Cutah-utes-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=preroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1445314523", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865639377%26content-category%3Dutah-utes%2Csports%2Cutah-utes-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=preroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1445314522", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865639377%26content-category%3Dutah-utes%2Csports%2Cutah-utes-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=preroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1445314524", "http://img.youtube.com/vi/jejfWm7TzeM/0.jpg", "http://img.youtube.com/vi/dcDytWZXads/0.jpg", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865639377%26content-category%3Dutah-utes%2Csports%2Cutah-utes-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=postroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1445314523", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865639377%26content-category%3Dutah-utes%2Csports%2Cutah-utes-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=postroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1445314522", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865639377%26content-category%3Dutah-utes%2Csports%2Cutah-utes-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=postroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1445314524", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team71.html"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:16:39.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
