Straight away I felt I had a lovely sound to the shot and I managed to get up on the hill and watch it disappear.\" \nThe 21-year-old Fitzpatrick again birdied 17 and 18 to maintain his first-place position on the leaderboard. \n\"It was pretty tough out there today for me, I didn't feel like I hit it my best,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"I scored well coming in to shoot 69 and stay at the top.\" \nFitzpatrick is chasing his first professional victory on the European Tour but is primarily focused on improving his world ranking of 111. \n\"I wouldn't say it is something I am concentrating on (a first win), it is more one hole and one round at a time,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"If the one doesn't come this week, but I keep moving up the world rankings, that is good enough for me.\" \nEngland's Richard Bland, who needed treatment on the course for a back injury, is a shot behind, alongside Thailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat. \nBridgestone Invitational winner Shane Lowry, of Ireland, is also in contention going into the weekend. He is two shots off the lead with 135. \n\"I'm pretty happy, I could have been a few shots better but I am in a good position going into the weekend,\" Lowry said. \"The two par-fives on the back nine were my front nine today and I didn't make birdie, which is a little bit annoying.\" \nTournament host Ian Poulter is five shots behind on a 4-under total of 138.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:32:42.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
