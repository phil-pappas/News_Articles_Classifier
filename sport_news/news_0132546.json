I think really good teams figure out how to manage that as best as possible.”\nJazz coach Quin Snyder\nPHOENIX — It’s easy for NBA fans to get excited about preseason statistics and optimistically project what those numbers might translate into during the regular season.\nSix assists and four steals for rookie point guard Raul Neto one game?\nTwenty-seven points for returning shooting guard Alec Burks the next game?\nOn the other hand, it might be easy for some to bite off their fingernails worrying about a performance like Friday’s ugly 101-85 loss to the Phoenix Suns, too.\nSmall forward Gordon Hayward had a strong showing with 24 points, including four 3-pointers, and power forward Derrick Favors had 13 points and seven rebounds.\nOther than that, it was a rough night for the visitors, who had a long flight from Hawaii on Thursday and were dealing with a three-hour time difference.\nJazz coach Quin Snyder wouldn’t let his team use that fatigue factor as an excuse.\n“There’s going to be times during the year where you’re fatigued. I think really good teams figure out how to manage that as best as possible,” Snyder said. “I’m not saying we were not fatigued. I think that was there. But at the same time, I didn’t think we played well. I think there’s more we can do, that we can own, than just kind of putting it on that.”\nEither way, Snyder isn’t impressed nor depressed about statistics and scoreboard results at this point. Just as he wasn’t overly exuberant about strong performances in two wins over the Lakers in Hawaii, Snyder will dissect his team’s performance Friday and compare it to previous games to pluck out learning lessons.\nWhile the Jazz coach wants his players, new and old alike, to have strong outings, the preseason isn’t about statistics or even wins and losses for him.\n“The chemistry and the continuity of our group is something that we’re conscious of right now as much as anything,” Snyder said. “I’m not as concerned sometimes with the actual results of people’s performances as much as how the lineups kind of function together.”\nSnyder gave a couple of rotation guys — starting point guard Trey Burke and backup small forward Joe Ingles — Friday off to allow for more evaluation of various combinations.\n“To me, it’s more about chemistry right now than it is one guy putting up this number or that number or he’s outplayed him because he’s scored 12 points and he’s scored four points,” Snyder said. “None of that stuff for our team really is important right now.”\nSure, it creates good sports conversation and it’s fun for fans to see their favorites have good games, but there are higher priorities than stats.\n“It’s more of a question of how do different combinations fit together? Who plays well with whom?” Snyder said. “We’re not going to have a situation where Rodney scores 20 points and Alec sores eight and now Rodney’s starting and Alec is not.”\nThis conversation led to Snyder diverting into another topic of vital importance — and presents somewhat of a quandary — for a young team that’s trying to continue its ascension into a playoff contender.\n“It’s all a question right now of how guys fit together,” Snyder said. “And we’ve got a number of guys that I trust, which is a good thing to have. But it’s also hard at times to try to find lineups and manage minutes.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:23:14.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
