They were here for 20, 25 minutes during practice.” \nSprague said his team would have been in trouble had Adams and Frias played. \n“If (Fullerton) would’ve had those two kids, they would have beaten us,” he said. “This was a big one for us.” \nFullerton led, 5-4, late in the first half, but Napier scored on a pair of counterattack goals on assists from goalie Ben Angulo in the final 1:30 to give Sonora a 6-5 lead at the half. \nNapier scored three goals in the second half and George Prado added two. Angulo finished with 10 saves, three assists and three steals after playing the final three periods in goal. \nFullerton’s Brian Schrandt fouled out with four minutes left in the third, but Ethan Foglesong (six goals) and goalie Luke Dumlao (15 saves) kept the Indians close. \nIn nonleague: \nNo. 9 Laguna Beach 15, Montebello 14: Judge Washer scored with about one minute left to give the host Breakers (11-9) a two-goal lead and they held on. \nIn the Sunset League: \nNo. 7 Newport Harbor 10, Los Alamitos 6: Joe Ferraro made nine saves to help lead the host Sailors (12-10, 2-1). \nFountain Valley 10, Marina 9: Ben Schmiesing scored five goals and Kyle Reilly added four to lead the Barons (15-9, 1-2). \nIn the Trinity League: \nNo. 1 Mater Dei 17, Servite 1: Billy Motherway (nine saves) and Nolan Strout (four) led the way for the host Monarchs (15-1, 3-0). \nContact the writer: dalbano@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T11:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:15:32.563+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
