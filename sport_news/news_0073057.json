Coach Mike Babcock said the defenceman was injured, but did not expand.\n“I don’t know how serious it is,” said Babcock. “Day-to-day. That usually means 10 days. I don’t know the answers.”\nGardiner had points in two straight games (one goal, one assist). Defenceman Martin Marincin will return to the lineup in Gardiner’s place.\nThe Leafs are also without centre Tyler Bozak, who’ll miss his second straight game with an undisclosed upper-body injury. Mark Arcobello will replace Bozak.\n“Any time guys are out of your lineup, especially pieces like that, it’s an opportunity for guys to step up,” said captain Dion Phaneuf. “Injuries happen to all teams. We’re no different. It’s a chance for guys to step up and fill those holes.”\nIt is the Leafs’ 100th regular-season visit to Buffalo. The Leafs have a record of 27-61-11 in Buffalo.\nMore on thestar.com\nBlue Jays-Royals ALCS Game 5 tip sheet: Price available out of bullpen\nBlue Jays chat with Richard Griffin: RECAP", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:30:29.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
