Taylor also scrambled for 24 more on third-and-23 from the Bills 7 jumpstarting an 80-yard drive he capped with a 2-yard TD pass to Chris Hogan. Taylor caught a 4-yard pass from Hogan to set up that TD. \nStephon Gilmore intercepted Marcus Mariota’s pass with 1:32 left to seal the win. \nThe Titans (1-3) blew a second straight double-digit lead at home and have lost two straight by a combined three points. \nTennessee outgained the Bills 279-209 and held the ball for more than 35 minutes. But the Titans settled for a pair of field goals by Ryan Succop and a 1-yard TD run by Antonio Andrews. \nThe Titans also had four sacks and recovered a fumble on a punt return to set up their touchdown. \nThe Bills played without wide receiver Sammy Watkins (calf) and running back LeSean McCoy (hamstring) for a second straight week with McCoy’s replacement Karlos Williams also out recovering from a concussion. \nThe Bills lost another running back to injury in the second quarter when Cierre Wood was carted to the locker room with an injured knee and did not return. \nTaylor got the Bills going in the third quarter. He had plenty of room to run on the third-and 23, a play that put the Bills near midfield with a horse-collar penalty on Titans linebacker Zach Brown. The Bills’ quarterback then turned in his biggest play, finding Hogan for a 40-yard pass to the Titans 7. \nBuffalo nearly had a great start to the game when Bishop Sankey fumbled the kickoff in the end zone, and the Titans recovered at the 2.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:17:42.710+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
