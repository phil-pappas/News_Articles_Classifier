And it doesn’t involve a snooze alarm to wake up the older players.\n“I’m 31, and I’m starting to feel like the old man here,” goalie Jimmy Howard said. “But we’re transitioning.”\nThere are only nine players older than 30 on the Wings’ current 23-man roster and five-man injured list.\n“When I first got here,” said Howard, “you were still a kid when you turned 30. There was a heavily veteran roster with much older players. That was the attitude. But now there’s an effort in taking more advantage of the young talent that we’ve been developing in Grand Rapids. They’re getting a chance to show, and it’s bringing a renewed energy to everything.”\nThat’s a phrase that will be used frequently this season.\nRenewed energy.\nIt suggests an effervescence previously lacking.\nThe Wings grew stale the last three seasons, clinging to a graying ideal that advanced age brought immeasurable wisdom and will. And to their credit, the Wings successfully mined plenty of production out of older players given up for retired. But they waited too long to integrate younger players.\nThe Wings had an excellent coach who cared about winning right now, creating an environment in which the young and inexperienced skated on egg shells — worried more about making mistakes rather than playing with the ease in knowing that they’ll get the opportunity to learn from those mistakes playing nightly in the NHL.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nSeason predictions: Can Detroit Red Wings advance past 1st round?\nExit Mike Babcock.\nEnter Jeff Blashill.\nGeneral manager Ken Holland should feel more liberated this season. Babcock even noticed that upon his return to Joe Louis Arena last Friday with his new team, the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n“When Kenny and I talked before the game,” Babcock said, “we talked about how the change brought a new kind of energy for both of us. Everyone needs a new challenge. Bringing in Blash has brought some fresh jump to this organization and the good kids they’ve got coming in. And that’s good for Kenny.”\nHolland doesn’t hide his enthusiasm for the one kid getting the most attention, 19-year-old Dylan Larkin. He drafted the former Michigan star with the 15th overall selection in 2014, the highest draft pick the Wings have had in 22 years.\nIt has been a long time since a teenager made the Wings’ opening night lineup. It’s expected that Larkin will play alongside captain Henrik Zetterberg and Justin Abdelkader. They’re putting him in the best possible position to succeed. But Holland is clear in that he’ll closely monitor how the young man is handling the new responsibilities.\nIt’s not a coincidence that the Wings gave Pavel Datsyuk’s cubicle to Larkin in the Wings’ dressing room as Datsyuk remains idle from off-season ankle surgery. It’s wedged between Abdelkader and Darren Helm.\n“It’s good being between two excellent veterans like that, because I have some questions because this is new for me,” Larkin said. “It’s an exciting time for me, but I’m trying not to get caught up in everything about being the first 19-year-old to make the team in some time. I just want to keep working hard and try to keep getting better.”\nBut Larkin’s arrival’s already brought a buzz — an energy — to the Wings. Raised in Waterford Township, Larkin said the first time he ever put on a Wings jersey, he was 3 years old. It was first time he ever skated.\nThat was 1999. The Wings were a year removed from consecutive Stanley Cup championships.\nThe Wings could never hope to draft anyone remotely close to Larkin’s overall talents considering how low they drafted annually. They did have a proven formula: spending freely and aggressively scouting Europe.\nBut fiscal equity has brought competitive balance and placed a greater emphasis on drafting and developing your own future stars. That means getting younger and taking a few more chances. Something the Wings couldn’t do previously.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nDetroit Red Wings 2015-16 season preview\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nRed Wings pick their last meals before season starts\nContact Drew Sharp: dsharp@freepress.com.
