The lads are devastated. You're left scratching your head sometimes. \n\"We worked really hard at 10 men and had the majority of the play in the second half. It's a summary of our season at the minute.\" \nMourinho may now risk a stadium ban, having been handed a suspended one-game ban by the Football Association last week for accusing the referee of being \"afraid\" during his side's recent 3-1 home defeat by Southampton. \nChelsea could also be punished for failing to fulfil their post-match media duties. \nSlaven Bilic's West Ham, now unbeaten in seven league games, finished the day in third place. \nElsewhere, Jamie Vardy became the eighth player to score in seven successive Premier League games as Leicester City beat Crystal Palace 1-0 to move up to fifth place, four points clear of sixth-place Palace. \nAndre Ayew increased the pressure on beleaguered Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood with an 87th-minute goal that earned Swansea City a 2-1 win at Villa Park. \nAyew's younger brother Jordan had headed Villa ahead in the 62nd minute, but Gylfi Sigurdsson equalised six minutes later with a fine 25-yard free-kick before Ayew the elder struck at the death. \nDefeat meant that Villa remain second from bottom, four points from safety, with only four points from 10 games. \n\"Am I going to be in the job next week? I'm not the person to ask,\" Sherwood said. \"I feel like the club is in a hole.\" \nCaptain Troy Deeney and Almen Abdi scored as Watford won 2-0 at Stoke City, while Salomon Rondon's header earned West Bromwich Albion a 1-0 victory at Norwich City.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:18:52.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
