In the SEC, Vanderbilt and Georgia are struggling at midseason, while nationally the American Athletic Conference is making its case for the best non-Power Five conference.\nOur panelists — Nick Vergos from The Rendezvous, former University of Memphis player Chris Powers, Tiger basketball writer Jason Smith, Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace, PGA Tour golfer Shaun Micheel and WHBQ-AM 560 sports talk show host Peter Edmiston — weigh in.\nTHE MEMPHIS QUESTION\nThe Tigers find themselves where they've never been: positioned to be the best of the non-Power Five conference teams and earn a spot in a New Year's Six bowl. What did the U of M learn about itself in last weekend's upset of No. 13 Ole Miss and how will the Tigers handle the additional pressure beginning Friday at Tulsa?\nNick Vergos: The Tigers learned that their defense can win them games. The Paxton Lynch-led offense has been the focal point of the season thus far, but the Tigers' defense deserves some credit. They were able to hold an Ole Miss offense that has unlimited weapons to 24 points while forcing two turnovers. Other than the loss at Florida, this was Ole Miss' worst offensive display. The Tigers did a great job treating the game versus Ole Miss like any other; they were diligent in their preparation and executed the game plan almost to perfection. If the Tigers keep this recipe, I do not see a letdown versus Tulsa.\nChris Powers: One of the traits of the 2015 Memphis team has been playing with confidence. The Tigers have an expectation of winning every time they take the field. Last Saturday's game against Ole Miss was the biggest test this team has faced so far and they passed with flying colors. Coach Justin Fuente's message to his team before the Ole Miss game was: 'You don't have to be anything you're not to win this game; play to your ability and that will be enough.' The Tigers did exactly that. The success they had last week will give them evidence, rather than just a belief, that they can play with anyone in the country. Fuente has also done an excellent job of keeping his team in the moment.\nJason Smith: I think Memphis learned it can play with anybody in the country. I'm sure the Tigers believed as much going into the Ole Miss game, but now they know it, and that makes them even more dangerous going forward. Now Memphis goes into the second half of the season knowing — not just believing — it can win each of its last six regular-season games because it's already knocked off the best team on its schedule. I don't think you have to worry about overconfidence here either. If there's anything we've learned about Fuente's teams during this 13-game winning streak, it's that they take things one game at a time. I doubt they stumble Friday at Tulsa.\nChris Wallace: The Tigers learned once again to — in the words of Nick Saban — \"trust the process\" as for the fourth time they stormed back from a double-digit deficit to win a game. This is a team with tremendous inner-confidence and resolve, underrated talent across the roster and a coaching staff doing a fabulous job, as evidenced by the remarkable improvement of the defense. The Tigers are now the hunted instead of the upstart underdog, but I do not expect the role reversal to affect this team at all. Look for a decisive win at Tulsa.\nShaun Micheel: If you were at the Liberty Bowl on Saturday you saw a Memphis team that felt no sense of urgency after the two quick scores by the Rebs. The Tigers stuck to the game plan and, of all things, let the defense win the game for them. That may have been a first this season but that should take some of the pressure off quarterback Paxton Lynch & Co. going forward. Hopefully the celebration of last week's game is over because Tulsa will be looking to knock off the nationally ranked Tigers. No doubt, as the Tigers continue to win, additional pressure and scrutiny will follow.\nPeter Edmiston: Seems to me that the win was a vindication of the way Justin Fuente has approached the task of building his program. And, in some ways, the way the Tigers won was a microcosm of that process — underdog going in, off to a very tough start, turned around thanks to a fabulous QB and a multitude of big plays, followed by results that shocked the college football world. It's easy to forget how roundly Fuente was roasted by so many just a couple of seasons ago for choosing to play Paxton Lynch over Jacob Karam. But Fuente and Lynch haven't forgotten, I'd bet. As a result, I don't think there's much that fazes them. The Tigers learned that they've got a defense that can, in fact, pressure the quarterback with the right blitz calls and schemes. That was a missing component early in the season. If that remains, there's no reason the Tigers can't run the table — starting with Tulsa.\nTHE SEC QUESTION\nIn the SEC, considered the best conference in the nation, coaches are quickly placed on hot seats. At the midway point of the season, which SEC coaches — Derek Mason at Vanderbilt? Mark Richt at Georgia? — find themselves on the hottest seats? And why?\nVergos: In today's college football world, fans want immediate results. There is no longer a grace period for rebuilding. James Franklin spoiled Vanderbilt; until Franklin's arrival, Vandy could not fathom consistently winning eight games a year. After his departure, the Vandy fans expect eight wins a season, but Derek Mason has realized it is incredibly difficult to recruit players to an academic school to compete with likes of Alabama and Tennessee. In the case of Mark Richt, Georgia now looks to be on the decline after blowing a big lead to Tennessee and barely edging Missouri, 9-6.\nPowers: There have been grumblings about Mark Richt from the UGA camp for what seems like 10 years now. It's similar to the frog in the boiling pot analogy. His seat hasn't gone from cold to hot in one season. The temperature (or discontent) has been growing for some time. A program like Georgia, with every advantage any program could ask for, really has no excuse for not winning an SEC title since 2002. Georgia fans expect more. Richt can still deliver this year. If the Bulldogs can get past Florida next week, they will be the favorite from the East to reach Atlanta. As for Vanderbilt, the Commodores seem to have quickly regressed in the post-James Franklin era. For every advantage Georgia has, there are just as many hurdles for Vandy. But Vanderbilt's progress under Derek Mason should be measured differently from Richt's. If Mason can show measured improvement in areas leading to the building of a winning program, he should be given a fighting chance.\nSmith: Mason might be in over his head at Vanderbilt, but does the seat really get hot at Vandy now just because the Commodores had a couple winning seasons under James Franklin? How many losing seasons did Bobby Johnson have in the eight years he was there (seven, right?), and was he canned? Nope. As far as Richt, it seems like his name comes up in these hot-seat discussions every year, and every year he's back. The two that better watch their backs are at Tennessee and Arkansas. Butch Jones and Bret Bielema have both had time to get things turned around and have gone a combined 27-35 in 2&frac12; seasons. How much more time will they get?\nMicheel: The SEC and its coaches are victims of their own success. These universities all have substantial athletics budgets with the best facilities, the best opportunities for recruiting and guaranteed network television every week. Those benefits create a culture of winning. There may have been a time when 10-win seasons kept the vultures from circling. No longer. Fans want championships and they want them now. Richt has been on the hot seat for as long as I can remember and the beat down, at home, by Alabama may have been the final nail in that, proverbial, coffin. Derek Mason has a little more latitude but he'll need to show some momentum going into next season as coaches are lying in wait to take over an SEC program, even Vandy.\nEdmiston: Gus Malzahn and Bret Bielema are on the hottest seats in the SEC, and with good reason. Both make in the neighborhood of $4 million per season, both have had plenty of opportunity to put their own stamp on their program by playing their own distinctive brand of football, and, in both cases, it simply isn't working. Considering the incredibly high bar teams need to reach both in recruiting and in actual performance to compete in the SEC West, any slippage is going to be harshly punished. I'd also add that Bielema hasn't done himself any favors with his overactive mouth and his sideline histrionics; there were few, if any, of his fellow coaches rushing to his defense after Texas Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury verbally smacked him down after the Red Raiders upset the Hogs in September. I think patience in Fayetteville is wearing very thin indeed.\nTHE NATIONAL QUESTION\nWith the American Athletic Conference boasting three teams — Memphis, Houston and Temple — in the Top 25, does the league deserve a serious look at being designated a power conference? Would several years producing Top 25 programs boost its case or will the best teams most likely need to fend for themselves to earn an invite to a Power Five?\nVergos: The AAC is top heavy and bottom heavy. The teams within the AAC are either very good or very bad. The conference itself does not deserve a serious look at being designated a power conference, but teams like Memphis, Houston, and Temple should be looking to earn an invite to any of the Power Five.\nPowers: For a three-year-old conference, the AAC has had a remarkable amount of success this year. Conference teams boast signature wins over Penn State, Louisville and Ole Miss. Next weekend Temple plays Notre Dame and Houston matches up against Vanderbilt. Both games are opportunities to enhance the perception of the AAC. The AAC has the same number of ranked teams (three) as the Pac-12 and lag just behind the ACC, Big Ten, and Big 12 (four each). The AAC has joined the Power Five in instituting reforms such as full cost-of-attendance scholarships and concussion protocols. The best teams in the AAC would jump at an invite to a Power Five conference. Once the next round of conference realignment begins (we're looking at you, Big 12) the AAC will probably lose one, if not two, of its best programs.\nSmith: The AAC would need to have the same kind of success it's having this season for a few more years before it deserved any serious consideration of being designated a Power Five conference. A couple years ago the AAC had five men's basketball teams ranked in the AP poll in the same week, which was half the league's membership at the time. Did that earn it a reputation as one of the nation's top basketball conferences? No. Why? Because you have to do it consistently, year after year. So for now, yes, the best programs in this league will keep working for that invite to a Power Five league.\nWallace: As someone who is drawn to the underdog narrative, I love what the AAC teams have accomplished so far this season. If the conference stays intact and this season's success against the so-called Power Five becomes the norm, I would expect several years from now an adjustment in the playoff seeding. However, the most secure route for a sustained elevation of their football programs is for the Tigers and others of their ilk to become members of a Power Five Conference.\nMicheel: The AAC is holding its own against the other Power Five conferences, but an invitation is going to be the only way for Memphis to join forces with one. I don't see the addition of a sixth power conference unless the CFB Playoffs are expanded to eight teams. For now, let's just enjoy the Tigers' success and gauge where the interest level is at the end of the season.\nEdmiston: It's an impressive achievement for the American to have three ranked teams, especially since they're not Cincinnati or Central Florida, the two American teams with the largest amount of recent success (heck, UCF was a Fiesta Bowl team just two seasons ago; its decline is mind-blowing). However, that does not a Power Five conference make. First of all, the American would have to consistently have teams remain at this level for several seasons to earn enough nationwide publicity to generate a groundswell of support for a campaign like that. Secondly, they would then have to convince the College Football Playoff folks to make a major change in designation, another unlikely event. It's far more likely that teams like the Tigers will have to claw and scratch to make their way into a Power Five conference. That enormous financial chasm between the haves and the have-nots can't be bridged by one or two surprisingly excellent seasons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:34:54.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
