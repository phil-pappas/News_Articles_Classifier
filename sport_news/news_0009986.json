Playing without senior Jordan Upham, who tweaked his back last week against Coconino, junior Trey Meyer stepped into the quarterback roll and led the Marauders to victory. With a slow start in the first quarter the Marauders were able to figure things out offensively throughout the game, controlling the clock and working their way down the field. \"Trey did a great job handling the offense for us, we were able to run the offense without really having to change anything,\" Head Coach Bob Young said. \"It was a little wet down there so we were a little worried about ball security but we didn't have any turnovers so it worked out.\" Meyer was the first one to cross the goal line for the Marauders as he snuck in behind his lineman for a 2-yard touchdown run that put Mingus up 7-0. After a big gain by running back Anthony Accurso which brought the Marauders within the ten-yard line. Senior running back Tristan Clark finished off the drive scampering into the end zone on a halfback pitch. The Marauders went into halftime with a 17-0 lead. After halftime, a pitch and catch from Meyer to his big tight-end Trevor Galloway brought the Marauders within the 20-yard line. Fullback Alec Phyfer finished off the drive with a 5-yard plunge. That score put the Marauders up 23-0. Cole Phelps put the last score on the board for the Marauders scoring from within the 10-yard line. The Marauders didn't have any big highlight touchdown plays through the game and mainly controlled the clock in the second half, running the ball and sustaining drives. On the defensive side of the ball the Marauders earned their second straight shutout and their third of the year. Aizik Romero came down with an interception for the Marauders on their way to another big victory. With two weeks left in the season, Mingus holds sole ownership of the Division III section VIII crown. With a 2-0 section record, Mingus stands above Bradshaw Mountain (2-1), Flagstaff (1-1), Prescott (1-1) and Coconino (0-3). Mingus closes out the season with a match up at home against the Flagstaff Eagles next week, and then travel to Prescott in the last week of the season to face off with the Badgers. Section VIII is tightening up as the season comes to a close and anything could happen in the last two weeks of the season. -- Follow Greg Macafee on Twitter @greg_macafee and Instagram @VerdeValleyNews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:54:36.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
