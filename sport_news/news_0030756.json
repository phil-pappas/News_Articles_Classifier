If both clear waivers by noon on Tuesday, they will be assigned to the Panthers' AHL affiliate in Portland, Maine. Their exodus could mean that veteran forward Martin Havlat, who's in camp on a professional tryout basis, has a chance to make the final 23-man roster, which is due at 5 p.m. Tuesday.\n\"It's never an easy decision. We're thinking big term,\" Tallon said of Crouse. \"We felt it was more beneficial to play lots of minutes in junior and play in the World Junior [Championship] and have some success opposed to playing every other night on the third or fourth line.\n\"He's very close, but long term it was a benefit for him to … play with his peers and get some confidence that way and be the No. 1 guy on his team.\"\nTallon said the overall team depth as well as the stunning emergence of rookie forward Connor Brickley led to his decisions involving Wilson and Crouse.\n\"[Brickley] earned a job. He had a great camp and it started in rookie camp,\" Tallon said. \"He's been terrific every day in practice and in games. It's a full body of work.\nSun Sentinel staff predictions for 2015-16 Florida Panthers There is some buzz in Panthers land with some excellent young talent in front of a stalwart, veteran goalie in Roberto Luongo. There is some buzz in Panthers land with some excellent young talent in front of a stalwart, veteran goalie in Roberto Luongo. Read the story \"[Wilson] was our last cut. He's a solid player who has improved in all areas. He's going to get a lot of games if he's still here with us … which we hope he is.''\nBrickley, 23, who scored 23 goals in the AHL last season, scored three goals in three rookie games and then added two more in the preseason while issuing bone-jarring checks on a regular basis. Tallon added that Brickley's fourth-line partner, rookie wing Quinton Howden, 23, also made the team because of his \"speed and versatility.\"\nCrouse, who had one assist and two shots on goal in three preseason games, tweeted out his reaction to the decision: \"Had an amazing time with @FlaPanthers. Excited to get things going with the @KingstonFronts again.\"\nFive things the Panthers need to reach the playoffs The Panthers weren't eliminated from a 2015 playoff berth until the 79th game of the 82-game season.\nHowever, getting close doesn't mean much to a fan base for a team that has made the playoffs just four times in its 21-year history.\nThat said, the Panthers did improve by a league-best 25 points...\nThe Panthers weren't eliminated from a 2015 playoff berth until the 79th game of the 82-game season.\nHowever, getting close doesn't mean much to a fan base for a team that has made the playoffs just four times in its 21-year history.\nThat said, the Panthers did improve by a league-best 25 points...\nRead the story \"It's a special feeling for myself to realize that this is what it'll take to be at this level and I'm willing to do whatever it takes, so it's a good steppingstone for me,\" Crouse said recently.\nThe 6-foot-4, 215-pound Crouse will not follow the route of the Panthers last two 18-year-old first round picks — Aaron Ekblad and Aleksander Barkov — who made a seamless leap into the NHL four months after being drafted. Instead, he hopes to mimic the career path of Jonathan Huberdeau, who Tallon sent back to juniors only to see him win the Calder Trophy the following season.\n\"It certainly helped him,\" Tallon said of Huberdeau.\nCrouse has been projected to be a top-six forward, and the Panthers only had one slot for him on a crowded, defensive-oriented fourth line that includes veterans Shawn Thornton and Derek MacKenzie.\nCrouse, who scored 29 goals for the Frontenacs last season, was given an eight-game suspension for a head hit on North Bay's Marcus McIvor in the final game of the regular season. He will only have to serve half of that if he reports before Wednesday's game.\nTallon said that negotiations with Havlat's agent, Allan Walsh, were ongoing, and that he was, \"hopeful,\" to get a contract done. But he also wasn't sure where Havlat — who in 14 years has tallied 241 goals but only 32 over his last four injury-plagued seasons — would fit.\n\"We're trying to find the right place for Marty,\" Tallon said. \"We don't want to sign him and [have him] sit in the press box.\"\n Ice Hockey Florida Panthers Martin Havlat American Hockey League NHL Dylan Olsen Shawn Thornton", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56104a8b/turbine/sfl-florida-panthers-season-predictions-20151003", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561083d0/turbine/fl-panthers-5-things-1004-20151003", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5612cd14/turbine/fl-florida-panthers-crouse-1006-20151005"], "published": "2015-10-05T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:28:33.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
