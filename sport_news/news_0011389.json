Ward passed for 222 yards and ran for 77. \nHouston held Tulane (2-4, 1-2) to 262 total yards and forced 11 punts. Devin Powell started for the Green Wave with Tanner Lee out after sustaining a concussion a week ago against Temple, and completed just 11 passes for 88 yards. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
