MerryLynn Denny September evaporated under a warm sun and October is well underway. MerryLynn Denny A young zebra head white-crowned sparrow. This is one of my favorite times of the year. We still have wonderful, comfortable days and cool crisp nights, along with apples, golden wheat stubble fields, blooming rabbit brush and sage, great numbers of migrant waterfowl and colored trees and shrubs. This is the time of in the annual circle of life when most deciduous trees and shrubs are covered with reds, gold’s and orange leaves. Resident animals finish collecting food stuffs for winter, many wild birds have headed south into Central or South America to rest up in the austral summer before returning here next spring to breed. Most insects are headed into hibernation or have laid eggs and died. Most forbs have gone into dormancy or have produced seeds waiting for winter’s moisture and warmer soils of spring. This is the month that pushes the door to winter slightly ajar. For this month’s column, I’d like to share information about white-crowned sparrows. These seed eaters are part of a very well studied complex of birds. There are five sub-species, three of which breed in Washington state. The two that concern us here are oreanthas and Gamble’s, also known as “zebra heads.” The oreantha looks different from a Gamble’s in that it has a black lore, the area between the front of the eye and its pink beak. Oreanthas reach into Washington out of the Great Basin on the highest peaks in the northern Blue Mountains — places like Griffon Peak, Mount Misery, Oregon Butte and occasionally Table Rock. They like high-elevation sites above 5,000 feet and are the breeding white crowns of most high mountains in the Great Basin ranges, such as Owyhee’s in Idaho; Oregon Canyon and Steen mountains in Oregon; and Trout Creek and Pueblo mountains in Oregon and northern Nevada. The oreanthas come north to breed as the snows recede from these desert ranges. By mid-August they retreat downslope and south for the winter to spend cool months in lower elevation sites of the desert southwest. While oreanthas can be seen in the higher elevations of the Walla Walla Valley, their Gamble’s cousins can be seen in the lowlands. The Gamble’s are amazing travelers. These beautiful 7-inch-long sparrows come boiling up out of the Central Valley of California where they winter. They arrive in the Walla Walla Valley on or about the third week of March. The adults have crisp black and white stripes that run the length of their heads, hence the name zebra heads. These federally protected sparrows are gray and reddish brown and have a beautiful spring song. They have yellow beaks and a gray lore, the area between the front of the eye and the beak. They feed on insects, flower petals and plant seeds. They arrive in the Valley by the thousands, singing, chasing each other and eating their way north. By May 1 they are mostly gone from our area, headed north into central Canada to set up breeding territories. We won’t see this wonderful sparrow again until mid August, when a few arrive along the rivers in the Valley — a reason why riparian buffer zones are so important. They come by the thousands in September, and about 25 percent will stay through winter if it is mild. Most head south into central California. So as you drive around this month watch for these black and white stripe-headed sparrows. Many are out and about in the Lowden and Touchet areas. Enjoy them and listen to their outstanding song — a great way to reduce your stress! We are very fortunate to live here and not in a huge metropolitan area. So just a request as you are out enjoying this great Valley — please pick up what litter you see. There is a small percentage of folks who just do not get it. They believe that it is just fine to litter; it is not. Remember life is good! Mike Denny is president of the Blue Mountain chapter of the National Audubon Society.
