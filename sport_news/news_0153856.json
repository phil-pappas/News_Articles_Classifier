Overall, the Long Island, N.Y., native is leading the Big Ten in completion percentage (72.0) while passing for 794 yards, six touchdowns and five interceptions. \nSome of those totals were padded by the Week 1 triumph over Norfolk State, a game in which Laviano completed all four of his passes for 138 yards and three touchdowns while playing only in the second half. \nALSO: Where are the downfield passes? \nThe photo gallery above illustrates that Laviano's 656 passing yards through his first three starts are greater than all five of his predecessors and he's shown the most accuracy in terms of completion percentage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:00:45.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
