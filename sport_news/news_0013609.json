I’m happy we won,” Olpe senior libero Maddy Madrigal said, as the Eagles will play in the Lyon County League Tournament Saturday at White Auditorium. “It’s a good way to end the regular season.” \nBetween both matches, senior Jade Cole put 37 of 38 serve attempts in play with six aces on the night to pace an efficient serving night for the Eagles. \nOlpe started its triangular off with the hot hand, jumping to a 6-0 lead against Waverly, ranked fifth in 1A, in the first set. Brianna Vogts, a sophomore, helped fuel the Eagles’ early lead, which the Bulldogs chipped down to 12-10. Makenzie Barnard answered with a kill for Olpe, but Waverly scored six straight to take a 16-13 advantage. \nTrailing Waverly 18-17, Vogts, who finished the match with 16 kills, helped spark a 7-0 run to put the Eagles in the driver’s seat for a 25-20 win. \n“We were all working together as a team,” Olpe senior Aubrey Davis said. “We were all hyped up and ready to play.” \nThe size and assortment of power hitters from Waverly proved too much to handle in the next two sets. \n“We were upset,” Madrigal said of losing to Waverly, “but we knew that’s the foundation to build a stronger team.” \nBehind Kendra Henry’s powerful left-handed stroke, Waverly jumped to an early five-point lead, which the Bulldogs kept at a comfortable distance most of the second set. \nVogts pulled Olpe within two at 9-11 and the Eagles cut it to two again at 19-21. Waverly capped the set by scoring four of the next five points for a 25-20 victory, forcing a decisive third set. \n“We just got down on ourselves and we should’ve kept playing better,” Davis said. \nWaverly seized an 8-0 lead to start the final set, and the Eagles wouldn’t get any closer than three points in a 14-25 loss to end its opening match. \n“Waverly is a very good ball club and we knew we’d have to give it everything we have, and the girls did a tremendous job. Just a little mistake here and a little mistake there makes a big difference when you’re playing that kind of quality,” Stueve said. “I’m real proud of them. I told them that in the locker room that I’m very proud of them that they never quit. \n“They never quit, and as long as they’ve given everything they’ve got and they don’t quit, they’re still winners. Maybe the score doesn’t reflect it, but they’re still winners.” \nWhile Waverly swept Hartford — 25-19, 25-7 — the Eagles had plenty of time to either regroup for a strong finish or sulk from their loss. Their senior leadership prevailed, as after falling behind 0-2 to Hartford in the first set, the Eagles scored 11 straight. \n“We had to regroup and talk (the loss) over,” Davis said. “We had to get the rest of the team pumped up, but we were able to come out on top and how we wanted to win.” \nOlpe scored eight straight to open the second set, which saw the Eagles lead by double digits from 12-2 on. The win improved Olpe to 17-8 and 5-2 in LCL Play. \n“It feels really good to know that we were able to perform our best here at home with our community and students and families here to support us all,” senior Jacy True said. \nVogts recorded six kills against Hartford, finishing the night with 22. Davis added nine kills on the night. \nOther area scores: Madison split a two-match dual with Burlingame, losing 22-25, 25-16 and 22-25. Madison rebounded with a two-set sweep that included wins of 25-18 and 25-19.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:32:19.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
