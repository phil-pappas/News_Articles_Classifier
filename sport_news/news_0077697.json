While net earnings may remain negative up to FY18, CFO/CE will jump to 13.3% from 5.1%. We expect net debt:equity to reduce to 0.8x in FY18E vs 1.5x in FY15, as it repays the debt in SIPL standalone.\nP/B (absolute or relative) is not an effective valuation measure for SIPL, given large asset additions (hence depleted net worth) and no like-to-like peers. Our NPV-based SOTP valuation of SIPL’s assets implies 2.4x historical equity invested but a reasonable 1.4x restated equity these multiples are highly sensitive to traffic and interest rates (1% change traffic/cost of debt leads to 10%/6% valuation impact).\nPost the recent equity raise, minority stake sales and refinancings, the portfolio will be Rs 5.2 billion cash surplus in FY15-18 post meeting equity needs. Few Indian infra developers can display such creditworthiness. Consequently, SIPL has been using this advantage with bankers through refinancings.We have yet not built in the recent RBI rate cuts, but we build in gradual declines. Over the long term, key value-accretive refinancing can be through substitution of bank debt.\nFirst Published on October 08, 2015 12:14 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:14:56.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
