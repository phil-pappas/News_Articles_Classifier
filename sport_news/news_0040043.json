He deserves all the boos he gets.\"\nAs for the slide in question, which has drawn much controversy and debate since it occurred on Saturday night in Los Angeles, de Blasio offered his candid thoughts.\n\"It was a tackle; it was illegal; it was sickening,\" he said.\nde Blasio wasn't the only New York politician to express his opinion on the matter, either.\n\"I am glad that that great Brooklynite, Joe Torre, stepped up to the plate, and suspended Chase Utley for two games,\" Sen. Chuck Schumer said. \"I would have suspended him for three games. Because I watched the game and I saw what he did.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/de-blasio-chase-utley-deserves-suspension-dirty-slide-article-1.2394318"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:47:47.366+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
