We’re absolutely better than what we showed,” said Nebraska wide receiver Jordan Westerkamp, after his team lost 30-28 at home to Northwestern. What Westerkamp said after losing to the Big Ten team closest to his hometown in Illinois is correct. Nebraska football is better than its 3-5 record indicates. In the first year under new Coach Mike Riley, Nebraska football has lost an FBS leading four games in which they held leads in the fourth quarter. That’s one more than in seven combined seasons under Bo Pelini. “Football is a crazy game, lots of ups and downs,” Westerkamp continued. “It’s kind of a roller coaster ride and we’re on it in full force right now, but we’ll be ok.” They’re running out of time and chances though. The “NU Bowl” today was one the Huskers really needed to have if they are to go to an actual bowl game this year. Now the Cornhuskers have to go 3-1 over a stretch consisting of at Purdue, Michigan State, at Rutgers and then hosting Iowa. Today’s nail-biter continued the trend of the NU Bowl being extremely close. Now four of the last five Northwestern vs Nebraska football games have been decided by three points or less. All three of the match-ups in Lincoln have been decided by a field goal or less. The 2015 edition of Nebraska football is essentially a college gridiron equivalent of Shelly Levine in “Glengarry Glen Ross;” can’t close the deal. “You’ve got to have the right attitude,” said Huskers QB Tommy Armstrong. “Sometimes it’s not going as well as we want it to go, but we’ve just got to make sure we keep grinding. We can either give up or we can keep grinding this season out and keep working together.” Paul M.
