More than 1,500 women were sitting on dharna at three different places in Malwa alone. “We will stand with our male counterparts till the government moves from its stand. We are not convinced with any offer of talks from the CM till he announces an acceptable package,” said Baljit Kaur, a resident of Bhattal village sitting on the railway lines here. She is not the only one as a number of women travel to the dharna site by noon daily and go back home only late in the evening. Besides Rampura Phul (Bathinda-Ambala-Delhi), women were also found sitting in a group of approximately 500 on Shergarh (Bathinda-Sirsa) and Pathrala (Bathinda-Bikaner) routes. Harpreet Kaur Jethua said, “Punjab is the land of Mai Bhago and Mata Gujri who were examples of selfless services. We will not leave our ‘morcha’ till the government agrees to our demands.” Navjot Kaur (16), a Class XII student, distributing water at the protest site, said, “My father is out of home for the past nearly a month. I can see tension writ large on his face every time I see him. He knows I may have to drop my higher education owing to successive crop failures. I know he owes certain amount to the arhtiya too. I could not hold myself and thought I should at least stand with him in times when he needed me the most.” District president of the BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) Shingara Mann said, “Women joining us in great numbers have lent strength to our voice. The government has agreed to listen to us after nearly a month on roads. We don’t trust anyone till we are offered a practically acceptable package.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:06:28.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
