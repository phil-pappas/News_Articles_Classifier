Djokovic then served out the match. \n“Today, there is nothing to say. He’s playing a lot better than everybody,” Tsonga said. “You have to be in your best shape to beat him anyway, and everybody knows that it’s not easy to play your best tennis every match.” \nDjokovic has traditionally played well during the Asian swing following the U.S. Open when other players are either nursing injuries or tired after a long season. In terms of the quality of his tennis in China this year, though, the Serb said he’s never felt as confident. \n“I mean, only one set where I got a tiebreak in two weeks is quite incredible,” he said. “So I’m very, very pleased with the way I’ve played.” \nHaving a lot of fan support certainly helps. His Chinese supporters packed the stadium on Sunday with Serbia flags, and as Djokovic noted earlier this week some have even given themselves Serbian names and are learning his country’s national anthem. \nDjokovic thanked them for their support by writing a different Chinese character on the courtside television camera after each match (“love” and “fortune” are two of his favourites) and trying some Mandarin in his victory speech. \n“I need to work on my phrases more because I’ve been saying the same thing for too many years,” he said with a laugh. \nBut it’s not just China where he has been winning this year — it’s just about everywhere. \nAmong his accomplishments, with the Paris Masters and ATP Finals in London still left to play: \n— Djokovic became one of three men to play in all four Grand Slam finals in a single season in the Open era, joining Roger Federer and Rod Laver. (Laver, coincidentally, was in the stands to watch Djokovic’s win on Sunday.) \n— With wins in Beijing and Shanghai, he surpassed $16 million in prize money, the highest ever by a player in a single season. \n— He has also reached 13 consecutive finals dating back to January, second only to Federer’s 17 straight finals in 2005-06. \nAnd there’s every reason Djokovic could finish the season undefeated — he hasn’t lost in Paris or London since 2012. \n“I’m not thinking about being unbeaten ’till the rest of the year,” he said. “But, yes, that’s an option. It’s a possibility.” \nAs good as this year has been, he has more goals to achieve next year, chiefly among them capturing his first French Open and Olympic gold in Rio de Janeiro. He just hopes he’ll continue to have the motivation and stamina to keep it up. \n“I don’t want to get carried away by success,” Djokovic said, “because I want to be playing on this level for many more years to come.” © Copyright (c)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T22:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:00:09.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
