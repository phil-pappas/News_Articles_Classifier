Maddon said the move is in part because of Coghlan’s early success against him but also because he wants to get Coghlan playing time.\n“I need to keep him solvent,” Maddon said. “I need to keep him out there a little bit. Jorge has done a nice job, obviously. He's done a wonderful job, and Jorge will be back out there. But you ask these guys to pinch hit or come off the bench or play, and if you don't give them an opportunity to play, why would I expect a good result when you ask him to come off the bench?”\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs Jake Arrieta Joe Maddon National League Championship Series Citi Field New York Mets", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56242455/turbine/ct-cubs-mets-nlcs-spt-1019-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-19T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:34:35.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
