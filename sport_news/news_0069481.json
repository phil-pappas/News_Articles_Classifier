But that was before Burger, whose dad played at Penn State and had a six-year NFL career with the Jets and Chicago Bears, shot up to 6-foot-2 in an offseason growth spurt.\n“Now he’s a head taller than me,’’ Lopez said.\nThe new version of the now-225-pound Burger along with Lopez helped power the Colonials to a strong offensive showing in a 45-20 victory over Toms River East Saturday in a Shore Conference nondivisional game.\nWeek 7: All the Shore Conference scores, stories, videos and more\nWith the two tackles sealing the edges in Freehold’s option offense, quarterback Jake Curry had a perfect game throwing-wise, completing all 12 of his pass attempts for 214 yards. That included touchdowns thrown to Matt Curcio, Matt Krauss, Jamel Smith-Rush and Ashanti Worthy.\n“Our offensive line has jelled together pretty nicely over the year,’’ Burger said. “I think we’ve improved a lot.’’\nFreehold (5-2) added 187 rushing yards, with Worthy contributing 97 yards, in a game that was more a blowout than the final score indicated. Freehold led 32-0 at halftime but became sloppy in the fourth quarter, and Toms River East (0-7) capitalized by scoring three touchdowns in the period, two on runs by Avrey Delvalle.\n“There were some things we saw out there coverage-wise and Jake was able to get the ball there to the wideouts. We’ve worked very hard on our offense,’’ Freehold coach Dave Ellis said. “The kids are starting to get it and starting to put it together.’’\nBurger and Lopez on the other side of the ball were also effective. Freehold didn’t allow a first down in the first half. Burger also pulled in a pass from Raiders’ quarterback Jack Goodall for an interception.\nBurger is shopping for a place to play among colleges but said he doesn’t have any offers yet.\n“He’s probably someone colleges should be looking at. He’s a late-bloomer who only recently turned 17,’’ Ellis said. “He’s really come on strong this year. He was a decent player but the extra size and strength has helped him tremendously. He’s much more athletic and has much more of a burst.’’\nKey play: Curry and Smith-Rush connected on a 25-yard pass to open the game, sending Freehold off to the races.\nOffensive game ball: Freehold offensive left tackle Todd Burger was a force throughout the game.\nDefensive game ball: Junior linebacker Xavier Madera set the tone for the Colonials’ strong first half with a sack of quarterback Jack Goodall, setting up Burger interception a play later.\nUp next: Freehold visits Manalapan and Toms River East visits Jackson Memorial Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:08:00.682+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
