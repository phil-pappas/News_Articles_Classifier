The person places their feet on the chair's foot ring and their whole body is moving as they use their leg, back and stomach muscles to keep their balance while sitting.\nScientists from the University of Leuven in Belgium and from the University of Limerick in Ireland have studied energy expenditure among people sitting on the novel Back App chair compared with on an ordinary office chair with arm rest and back rest.\nThey found that energy expenditure increased significantly (p=0.001) on the novel Back App chair by an average of 19%.This is because energy is burned in order to keep balanced while on the Back App. [1]\nSame energy expenditure as when standing\nThe energy expenditure increase on the Back App chair was huge. From literature we know that when moving from sitting to standing energy expenditure increases by around 15%. Therefore the findings show that sitting on the novel Back App chair uses as much extra energy as when standing.\nCan burn 4 kg body fat per year\nIf an office worker sits on the novel Back App chair in their office for a year, they can burn 4 kg more body fat than if they sit on an ordinary office chair with arm rest and back rest.\nEven more possibilities to exercise with the Back App chair\nThe challenge of the novel Back App chair is adjustable. The \"Magic\" ball component can be moved up and down to adjust the stability of the chair, and therefore the amount of balancing required. In the study, the ball was in a moderately unstable position, not requiring much effort from the seated person. Screwing the ball down further increases the challenge and increases energy expenditure to even higher levels.\nSee us at NeoCon East, Philadelphia October 28 & 29, Booth 964, Hall D\nhttp://www.backapp.eu", "external_links": ["http://www.backapp.eu/", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151016/277611", "http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151016/277610"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:03:34.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
