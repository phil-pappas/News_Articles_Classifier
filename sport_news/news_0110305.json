Melton, who is in his second season as the starting left tackle for the Eagles, gave a verbal commitment to Fedora and Tar Heels assistant coaches Keith Heckendorf and Chris Kapilovic on Saturday. “They were very excited, had a lot of energy,” Melton said Monday night. “When I told them, they were fired up. Coach Fedora said it made his night.” Melton and his family met with Eastern Alamance coach John Kirby last week and discussed the plan, which was executed at Kenan Stadium before the Tar Heels routed Wake Forest 50-14. It ended a recruiting process that included offers from “13 or 14” schools, Melton said. Included among those were South Carolina, West Virginia, North Carolina State and East Carolina. But North Carolina had advantages in two of the biggest priorities for Melton, who wanted to remain close to home and plans on studying kinesiology. “I know that’s a top-four program in the nation, so that was really hard to turn down,” he said of the exercise science program, envisioning life as a strength and conditioning coach. Given his budding relationship with Kapilovic, who took over from Heckendorf as the main contact on the Tar Heels staff during Melton’s recruitment, and Melton’s status as a lifelong North Carolina fan, the decision isn’t much of a surprise for his current coach. “He wants to stay close to home and that’s the best fit for him and he has a great relationship with Coach (Kapilovic), the offensive line coach,” Kirby said. “This thing with him kind of went crazy in a quick time.” Melton’s recruiting process took form earlier this calendar year, when offers started pouring in during his sophomore year of school. He said committing during a football season, and about a year and a half before he can officially sign with the Tar Heels, wasn’t by design. “I really didn’t have a specific time frame of when I wanted to get it done,” Melton said. “I just knew whenever it felt right to do it, and I just wanted to build that relationship with the coaches even more.” By Conor O'Neill", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:15:54.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
