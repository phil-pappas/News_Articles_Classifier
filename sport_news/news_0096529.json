(AP) - The College of William and Mary has received a $50 million donation that will help fund scholarships, teaching awards and facility improvements. \nThe anonymous donation is the largest gift that the school has received in its 323-year history. \nIt comes as the public university in Williamsburg embarks on an ambitious effort to raise $1 billion by 2020. With the $50 million donation, the school is more than halfway to its goal with more than $532 million raised so far. \nWilliam and Mary's business and law schools will each receive $22 million to support scholarships, among other things. The remaining $6 million will go toward athletic facility improvements at the school. \nThe school says it's the smallest public university to ever launch a $1 billion fundraising campaign. 1 CONNECT    //on.wvec.com/1S0rIGv TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T13:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:26:00.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
