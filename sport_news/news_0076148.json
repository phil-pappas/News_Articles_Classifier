He turned upfield, was met by a Hokies defender before the goal line, but powered his way in.\nIt’ll be an extremely uphill climb to bowl eligibility from here for the Hokies (3-5, 1-3 ACC), who need to win three of their final four games against Boston College, Georgia Tech, North Carolina and Virginia just to make it to the postseason for a 23rd straight year.\nDuke (6-1, 3-0 ACC), which kept pace with Pittsburgh and North Carolina as unbeaten teams atop the Coastal Division, won on its second straight trip to Blacksburg.\nSirk threw for 270 yards and four touchdown passes, adding 109 yards on the ground in what was Duke’s eighth win in its last nine ACC road games.\nHokies quarterback Michael Brewer, who started for the first time since breaking his collarbone in the season opener against Ohio State, returned to the starting lineup and threw for 270 yards and three touchdowns to tight end Bucky Hodges, but it wasn’t enough.\nTech rallied from an 11-point second-half deficit to tie the game at 24 on a 23-yard touchdown pass from Brewer to Hodges with 2:07 left. McMillian’s two-point conversion run tied things up at 24.\nBoth teams missed late field goals to send the game to overtime.\nThe teams traded field goals in the first overtime to stay tied at 27.\nTech faced third-and-6 in the second overtime when Brewer hit Hodges in the back of the end zone for an 11-yard touchdown and a 34-27 lead. But Duke answered in three plays when quarterback Sirk hit Anthony Nash for a 4-yard touchdown pass to send the game to a third overtime.\nSirk got leveled on a blitz to start the third overtime but managed to get a pass off that Max McCaffrey made and over-the-shoulder grab on at the Hokies’ 4. But the Blue Devils only came away with a 20-yard field goal by Ross Martin to take a 37-34 lead.\nThe Hokies didn’t move the ball much on their possession, needing a 40-yard field goal by Joey Slye to send it to a fourth overtime. He nailed it, tying the game at 37. \n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image. Buy Pilot photos here. \n\nLoading...
