But never has he bounced a basketball in a game on American soil.\nUntil now. Huertas could make his NBA debut Sundaywhen the Lakers face Maccabi Haifa in their fourth preseason game at Staples Center.\n“Basketball here is a little different from what I’ve been used to my whole career playing overseas,” Huertas said after Saturday’s light practice. “It’s much more physical, explosive, aggressive.\n“Players are faster, super talented (with the) ability to score. Everyone is able to put numbers on the scoreboard. That’s the main difference. In Europe, everything is much more settled down and organized. Teams have good structure. You take care of the ball really well and try to play inside of a system.”\nHuertas’ NBA career was delayed by a bothersome right hamstring that he strained five days into training camp in Hawaii. Instead of sitting around Honolulu getting treatment, the Brazilian flew to Vancouver to finalize details of his work visa so he could be ready for the next phase of his career.\nHuertas will not only be counted on for his ability to create shots, he also is expected to be one of several mentors to rookie point guard D’Angelo Russell.\n“I think he can help him from a maturity standpoint and just experience alone,” Byron Scott said. “D’Angelo has a lot of guys that can help him: Marcelo, obviously KB (Kobe Bryant) is the guy who’s really taken him under his wing, and then JC (Jordan Clarkson), who has gone through it as well last year as a rookie and can give him some understanding of how difficult it is as a rookie in this league.”\nRUSSELL, BASS DOUBTFUL\nScott said he would wait until after Sunday’s shoot around at Staples Center before deciding whether he will play Russell (bruised glute) and Brandon Bass (knee contusion). Both missed the Lakers’ loss to Toronto on Friday.\n“We’ll see. I’ll talk to Gary Vitti and see how he (Russell) feels tomorrow after a regular shoot around day, so we’ll get up and down the floor and see how he reacts to that …\n“Right now I’d say doubtful, but tomorrow we’ll go through our regular routine as far as getting ready for the game and see how those guys feel.”\nScott said Russell still is experiencing some discomfort on his right side, and Bass continues to experience soreness in his knee.\nFOREIGN OPPONENT\nScott didn't know much about Israeli squad Maccabi Haifa and wasn't going to spend a lot of time researching the team. He said he was focused more on his own players.\n“I’m still trying to look at our players,” Scott said. “Our scouts know Maccabi pretty well, so we’ll go over their tendencies tomorrow, but right now I’m more focused on us than anybody else.”\nBOOKER SUSPENDED\nUtah forward Trevor Booker was suspended by the league Friday for one game without pay after striking Lakers center Roy Hibbert in the head in an exhibition game, the NBA announced.\nThe incident occurred in the Lakers’ preseason 117-114 overtime loss Tuesday in Hawaii. Booker was first assessed a technical foul for shoving Julius Randle in the third quarter, which prompted Hibbert to speak up. The Jazz forward responded by hitting Hibbert on the head with an open hand.\nHibbert and Booker were slapped with technical fouls, the second of which caused Booker to be automatically ejected.\nContact the writer: jcarr@ocregister.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/s-lakers.logo.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/s-lakers.logo.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:28:31.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
