By Jocelyn Sheets Newton Daily News \nBONDURANT — It was no-holds-barred football for Newton High’s Cardinals Friday night. \nThey put it all on the line against Bondurant-Farrar’s BlueJays. No reason not to as the Cardinals went into the Class 3A District 6 contest winless. \nNewton piled up 376 yards on the ground behind the running of seniors Joseph Banfield and Dalton Nevels and junior Reese Rosenquist. Sophomore quarterback Garrett Sturtz rushed for 31 yards and completed 5-of-10 passes for 60 yards. \nThe Cardinals didn’t commit a penalty in the game. They didn’t punt the football. Two Newton turnovers led to Bondurant-Farrar touchdowns and the Cardinals failed to convert on three fourth down situations in the game. \n“I felt like we were in great shape there halfway through the first half. We just couldn’t figure out how to get some stops on defense,” Newton head coach Ed Ergenbright said after a 52-28 loss in Bondurant. “And the injury bug continues to bite us.” \nNewton was in great shape. After the BlueJays jumped out to a 14-0 lead, the Cardinals mounted a nine-play, 58-yard drive to the end zone. Banfield and Sturtz had big runs to advance the football down the field. Sturtz connected with Jake Bennett for 15 yards on a pass play. \nBennett injured his shoulder on the play and did not return to the game. It was the first of several injuries to sideline Newton players on the night. \nBanfield capped the drive with a 2-yard touchdown run at the 4:18 mark of the first quarter. Josh Gulling kicked the extra point to make it 14-7. \nBondurant-Farrar had struck quickly after Newton failed to convert a fourth down on the first possession of the game. Dylan Story found Payton Duit on a 49-yard touchdown pass. A Cardinal fumble set up the BlueJays’ second touchdown — 22-yard run by Jarrid Clark on the option pitch from Story. \nThe BlueJays used the running of Cole Schlenker on their third possession, leading 14-7. The Cardinal defense stopped the Jays’ momentum with a tackle of Clark for a loss on third down to end the first quarter. \nBondurant-Farrar’s Keller Paulsen kicked a 36-yard field goal on the first play of the second quarter. \nNewton set up shop on its own 34-yard line following the kickoff. Sturtz kept the football and gained 11 yards to start the drive. The Cardinals picked up three straight first downs on runs from Banfield and Sturtz. \nBanfield pushed over the goal line for his second touchdown of the game on a 1-yard run at the 8:38 mark of the second period. With Gulling’s extra-point kick, it was 17-14. \nSchlenker bolted free on the BlueJay’s next possession for a 24-yard touchdown run. Newton came right back to move the football on runs by Sturtz and an 11-yard pass from Sturtz to Bryce Tish for 11 yards. \nThe Cardinals had the ball near midfield when Sturtz’s pass was intercepted by Bondurant-Farrar’s Seth Moeller. Moeller raced 45 yards for a touchdown. Paulsen’s extra-point kick put the BlueJays up 31-14 with 3:36 left in the first half. \nBack came the Cardinals. Nevels returned the kickoff to the Newton 35-yard line then had back-to-back runs for a first down. Rosenquist, who replaced an injured Banfield, had three runs to pick up a first down. \nA pass from Sturtz to Tish was incomplete, but the BlueJays were penalized for a personal foul. Newton gained 15 yards on the penalty and Sturtz connected with Tish on a 12-yard pass play. Nevels maneuvered through traffic for 17 yards and a touchdown. \nGulling added the extra point to pull the Cardinals within 10 points again, 31-21, with 30.8 seconds remaining in the first half. Two plays later, the BlueJays upped their lead to 38-21 when Clark broke two tackles getting to the corner and up the sideline for a 46-yard touchdown run with 9.3 seconds on the clock. \nNevels almost broke away to respond, gaining 26 yards, on a run to end the first half. On the second-half opening kickoff, Newton’s Trevor Ergenbright tackled Carter Wiedern and jarring the football loose. Unfortunately for the Cardinals, the fumbled football rolled out of bounds on the play and the BlueJays retained possession. \nSchlenker finished a 68-yard drive with a 1-yard touchdown at the 8:13 mark. Newton moved the football again, but came up short on a fourth-and-four pass play at the Bondurant-Farrar 29-yard line. Schlenker went right up the middle for a 72-yard touchdown run for a 52-21 lead. \nThe Cardinals failed on another fourth down attempt with 31 seconds left in the third quarter at the BlueJays’ 40-yard line. Newton’s defense held and Paulsen attempted a 47-yard field goal, which was short of its mark early in the fourth quarter. \nOn a drive comprised mostly of runs by Rosenquist, the Cardinals went 80 yards on 10 plays. Rosenquist, who finished with 90 yards on 20 carries, finished the drive with a 3-yard touchdown run with 3:52 remaining in the game. \nBanfield, who had 119 yards on 16 carries, attempted to return to the field in the second half, but only for one play. Linebacker Austin James suffered another injury in the first half for the second straight game. Andrew Weiland and Alex Miller, linemen, were injured in the second half. \nSturtz was 5-of-10 for 60 yards passing and he rushed for 31 yards. Nevels finished with 137yards on 14 carries for the Cardinals. Tish made two catches for 23 yards while Jwan Roush had a reception for 21 yards. \nJwan Roush and Cole Peters returned to the Newton starting lineup as defensive backs. Peters hadn’t played since the opener at Knoxville and Roush, who was a starting running back also, had been sidelined since the second game of the season. \nDuncan Lee racked up seven solo tackles and six assisted tackles from his linebacker spot for the Cardinals. Rosenquist had seven unassisted tackles and one assisted tackle and Jwan Roush had three solos and one assisted tackle. \n“It was the same thing as it has been all season. We gave up big plays defensively,” Ergenbright said. “The guys still never gave up. We have one game left. We’re going to try to get healed up and see if we can get one at home.” \nNewton is 0-8 overall and 0-5 in Class 3A District 6 play. The Cardinals host Nevada Friday in the final district contest. \nNewton 7-14-0-7—28 \nBondurant-Farrar — Duit 49 yd pass from Story (Paulsen kick) \nBondurant-Farrar — Clark 22 yd run (Paulsen kick) \nNewton — Banfield 2 yd run (Gulling kick) \nBondurant-Farrar — Paulsen 36 yd field goal \nNewton — Banfield 1 yd run (Gulling kick) \nBondurant-Farrar — Schlenker 24 yd run (Paulsen kick) \nBondurant-Farrar — Moeller 53 yd interception return (Paulsen kick) \nNewton — Nevels 17 yd run (Gulling kick) \nBondurant-Farrar — Clark 46 yd run (Paulsen kick) \nBondurant-Farrar — Schlenker 1 yd run (Paulsen kick) \nBondurant-Farrar — Schlenker 72 yd run (Paulsen kick) \nNewton — Rosenquist 3 yd run (Gulling kick) \nNewton Bondurant-Farrar", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:15:31.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
