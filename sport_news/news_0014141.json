He’s scheduled to do the same before games in November at the University of Alabama and Mississippi State.\nONPOLITICS\nJeb Bush makes SEC primary appeal at football game\nEarlier this week an item on the Bush campaign website from September that described the events and the schedule was titled “SEC Tailgating with Jeb.” On Wednesday, the item was titled “Tailgating with Jeb.”\nIn addition, as of Wednesday morning, the campaign’s online store was offering a drink koozie for $5 that featured a campaign logo resembling the conference’s circular SEC logo but instead using the letters \"JEB.\"\nBy Wednesday afternoon, the item had been removed from the store — and the \"JEB\" logo apparently will be gone or altered soon.\nThe campaign design — one version of which used blue and yellow, a la the SEC logo — was visible on signs and stickers at the campaign event this past Saturday in Knoxville.\n“We’ve been speaking with the SEC conference about that logo and ensuring that there is no trademark issues,” campaign spokesman Tim Miller said in an interview.\nAsked whether that means the campaign will be ending its use of the logo or substantially altering it, Miller said: “I think that’s what folks are talking about.”\nThe Bush campaign website also has been carrying a video titled “Jeb’s SEC Favorites,” in which the candidate discusses — among other topics — mascots, rivalries and his pick for which teams will play in the SEC championship game. As Bush speaks, the logos of Alabama, Auburn, Mississippi, Mississippi State, Florida and LSU alternately appear in the background.\nBefore I head to Rocky Top, I’m setting the record straight on some of my SEC favorites.\n https://t.co/guLA4uQd9k\n— Jeb Bush (@JebBush) October 9, 2015 Miller said the campaign’s use of the logos was “well within the fair use” principles that apply to political campaigns’ use of brief TV clips and other items in their advertising.\nUniversity of Alabama spokesman Chris Bryant provided a statement saying the university “was not aware its logo would appear within a campaign video. No one should consider the use of the logo as an endorsement of any candidate.”\nBush is running in the middle of the pack of GOP candidates behind Donald Trump and Ben Carson in most national polls.\n16 CONNECT 40 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE //usat.ly/1LunmGN", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6df8d0a1c3353d8f96bbcc9e3e8d57c1eeda7709/r=300/https/i0.wp.com/usatelections.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/ap_gop_2016_bush_76045922.jpg?fit=440%2C330", "http://usat.ly/1LunmGN", "https://twitter.com/JebBush/status/652475193395253248", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635804367912110015-Jeb-Bush-SEC.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c711c85d58e411988f13438d0dec93db9715f141/r=400x400/local/-/media/2015/10/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635804367912110015-Jeb-Bush-SEC.jpg", "https://t.co/guLA4uQd9k", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a896da512716e81ff4f1e91bd6db7aefa525974f/c=0-20-476-378&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/635804367912110015-Jeb-Bush-SEC.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LunmGN&text=SEC%2C%20Jeb%20Bush%20wrestling%20over%20conference%20logo%2C%20campaign%20tactics&via=enquirer", "http://onpolitics.usatoday.com/2015/10/10/jeb-bush-makes-sec-primary-appeal-at-football-game/", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LunmGN&mini=true"], "published": "2015-10-15T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:45:30.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
