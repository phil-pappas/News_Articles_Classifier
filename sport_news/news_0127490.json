ESU names April Huddleston as next head softball coach By Corbin McGuire corbin@emporia.com emporiagazette.com | 0 comments \nEmporia State softball has been a precious part of April Huddleston’s life for nearly a decade, which made stepping away to further her career in educational recruiting so difficult. \nLess than six months later, Huddleston’s softball career was revived. ESU announced Huddleston, a former player and assistant coach for the Hornets, as its next head softball coach Monday morning. \n“It’s something that’s honestly a dream come true for me,” Huddleston, who will replace Julie LeMaire, said over the phone Monday morning. “ESU has always been a special part of me, and one that with my new job I was going to have to give up. That was probably the most difficult decision I’ve ever made, and now I don’t have to do that. \n“It’s fantastic. I’m super, super pumped.” \nHuddleston was an assistant coach for ESU the past seven seasons and also served as a graduate recruitment and grant development specialist for ESU’s Graduate School during the past year. \nShe played shortstop for ESU in 2008 when the Hornets finished as the national runner-up, hitting .320 and earning First Team All-MIAA honors. \nHuddleston was recruited by Stacy Gemeinhardt, played for and coached with Kristi Bredbenner and most recently assisted LeMaire, who accepted a job at Nova Southeastern (Fla.) after four seasons with ESU. \nESU Athletic Director Kent Weiser said Huddleston’s experience with three very successful coaches was a plus in evaluating her as a candidate. \n“When you become a coach you pull the best things that you can from your mentors, but you have to develop your own style, and you make your own style based on the best things that you’ve learned from coaches with different personalities,” said Weiser, who made the hire less than a week after LeMaire’s departure was announced. “You learn from a lot of different areas, take the best from people and then make it your own style. I think April has done that and will do that.” \nHuddleston’s experience within ESU’s program, from the bottom-up so to speak, was a significant attribute Weiser, who interviewed two other candidates for the position, wanted to find. \n“It was really important that we find someone and identified someone who understands that program and how it was built,” said Weiser, adding that Huddleston’s dedication to the program while getting paid little was another admirable trait. \n“She’s just prepared herself for this, being with our program when we couldn’t pay her very much, if anything,” he said. “That love of her sport and the love of ESU is what prompted her to stay with us.” \nHuddleston, who will be formally introduced Friday at 10 a.m. in a press conference, was among the first group of players to enjoy the new set of locker rooms at Trusler Sports Complex, and she’ll be the first head coach to enjoy a full season on the newly installed artificial turf on Glennen Field. \n“It makes me proud,” Huddleston said. “The teammates I’ve played with over the years have meant the world to me and truly are family. To think about representing all of those passionate players and coaches as well, it’s super rewarding and something that I’m not going to take lightly. \n“We’re going to get out there right away and get to work on sustaining what we have, and building on it.” \nBefore taking over the program full-time, Huddleston has an “overwhelming to-do list” to take care of. Moving back from Wichita to Emporia tops the list, while wrapping up her current job and meeting with the current players are other items on the docket. \n“It’s overwhelming to say the least, but like I said, it’s a dream come true,” she said, with trips to Illinois and Branson, Missouri this week. “I’ve made some phone calls this morning to our returners and then plan to get ahold of our new kids before I leave, or at least touch base with them.” \nAfter Friday’s press conference, held in the Blue Key Room of the ESU Memorial Union, Huddleston said she planned on addressing the team before its fall practice. Upon finishing already scheduled trips for her current job, Huddleston said she’d start full-time with the softball program around Nov. 9. \n“She certainly knows what she’s doing,” said Weiser, who called Huddleston when the job first opened up. “She’s very well respected throughout the softball community. I just think having her skills, passion and talent here will be great for us.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:19:17.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
