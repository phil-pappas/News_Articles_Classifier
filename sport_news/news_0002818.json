Parrish \nDemocrat Editor \nMultiple times during this football season the 1980 season has served as a reference point. Of course in all cases the reference is less than flattering. \nFor instance after the Two Rivers game it was a list of the worst losses ever with the loss to the Gators supplanting one to Mansfield in 1980. Granted that parallel isnâ€™t exactly perpendicular, but some others were. \nThere was the loss to Danville the following week which was the first to the Little Johns since, you guessed it, 1980. Also perpendicular was the questions as to when was the last time there was a 1-4, 1-5 and 1-6 Bearcat team. Again, it was 1980. \nLast week the clamoring for heads also got more vocal, which was also quite common in 1980. \nOkay, minus the last note, at this point it may be time to just embrace the season that was 1980. \nWhy? In 1980 a 1-6 team regrouped to win two of their last three and post a 3-7 mark. Yes, it was still an ugly year, but the next season it was 6-3, followed by 7-4 and then three straight 10-0 campaigns. In other words, the world did not stop. \nIn 1980 the wins in weeks 8 and 10 were against Waldron and Paris, sandwiched around a loss to Charleston on Halloween, all played at home. This year week 8 and 10 are at Mansfield and Lavaca sandwiched around an Oct. 30 game here with Charleston. \nWant more reasons to not just mail it in? Because unlike 1980 there is still a chance at playing an 11th game, and for the nine seniors who went to midfield for the coin toss there is no next year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T13:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:58:24.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
