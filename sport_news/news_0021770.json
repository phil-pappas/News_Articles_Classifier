Matt Dimon was “in heaven,” as he puts it, enjoying a buffet of fast food that was brought to the airport in droves by team employees. \nAnd yes, Baker Mayfield danced. \n“There was the main room with the lobby and then there was a little conference room and a bunch of players were in the conference room going crazy,” Dimon recalled. “Every time you opened the door, that music was blaring.” \nSanchez claims that the team even got Dean of Students Clarke Stroud to join in on the fun. \n“I think everybody got in there and started dancing,” Sanchez said. “It could have been a lot worse but we made the most of it.” \nMore than anything, it created an environment that forced the Sooners to come together as a unit. \n“The thing was all of us dancing and using music to build us up and bring us together, making us closer as a team and not really worrying about the flight delay,” Dede Westbrook said. \nAs for the spread that was brought in to feed the players, it was all Bob Stoops’ idea. \n“It got to where it’s eight o’clock and our kids haven’t eaten,” Stoops said. “So I asked whoever who was in the building who had a car to just go out and go to any fast food chain you can. \n“If we have 10 people go out and get 10 of whatever, we’ll have enough food to feed our players. And that’s exactly what we did. \nAs for the variety to choose from, it was extensive. Dimon says there were at least six or seven restaurants represented. He enjoyed Whataburger, Sonic and Chick-Fil-A. Cornerback Jordan Thomas said he had Jack-In–The-Box, Burger King and Dominos. \nAfter Oklahoma’s dominating win over Kansas State, some players questioned whether or not this should be a permanent installation. \n“That will give (Stoops) more of a reason to keep doing it for us,” Thomas said. “We gotta have that junk food to fuel us.” \nBut even in a perfect world, the evening of splurging on junk food could end up costing the Sooners in a different way. \n“Our nutritionist is going to hate us,” Baker Mayfield said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:32:09.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
