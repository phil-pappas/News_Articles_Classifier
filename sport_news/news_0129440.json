While India did appear on course for a victory with Dhoni and Virat Kohli in the middle, the target grew bigger as the two failed to force the pace against Proteas’ attack. “Looking at the wicket, in the first half it behaved very differently and as the game progressed it became more and more difficult which meant that in the second half it continued to be on the slower side,” pointed out Dhoni. “I felt if the wicket had not changed, 270 would have been chaseable. It was difficult to play the big strokes because of the slowness of the wicket.”Dhoni agreed the lack of runs in the first 10 overs and then between 30th and 40th overs proved critical. “I think that was the crucial phase… The first 10 overs, I don’t think we got enough runs then, and again the phase between 30 and 40 overs,” he said.“We (Kohli and he) wanted to bat late, we started hitting towards the 37th over but we were not really able to connect… Virat and I were set and we wanted to play the big shots but we never really middled anything. If even the set batsmen are finding it difficult to middle the ball, it’s tough for the later batsmen to come and play those big shots. And also not to forget, the outfield here is quite big, which meant that when you are playing the big shots, you had to clear the field. It was a tough one specially when there was less pace in the wicket,” he explained.On his and Kohli’s promotion up the order Dhoni had this to say: “I want to bat up the order but at the same time I also want people who can contribute lower down the order. I have to mix and match it — this is the number of overs, if the wicket falls after this over, I will go into bat so that I can create partnership with enough deliveries. If I have played enough deliveries, then I can play the big shots later. That’s the thinking behind it which means that a few other batsmen will have to accommodate according to that. They may score at times, they may not score at times but the good thing is that it gives them the experience of batting down the order,” he reasoned.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T16:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:13:18.753+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
