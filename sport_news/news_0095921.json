By CHRISTOPHER WEBERAssociated Press \nLOS ANGELES (AP) - Lamar Odom's family said Thursday that his speech is improving as he undergoes therapy in Los Angeles more than a week after the former NBA star was found unconscious in a Nevada brothel. \n\"He is beginning to gradually flourish both mentally and physically,\" said a statement from Alvina Alston, publicist for Odom's aunt JaNean Mercer. \"His use of speech has increased and he's more cognitively responsive.\" \nAlston called Odom's therapy regimen \"aggressive,\" but she did not elaborate. \nA day earlier, Odom and reality star Khloe Kardashian filed a court petition dismissing a divorce filing from December 2013. A clerk granted the request in such a way that the divorce papers can be refiled at a later date. \nKardashian has been by Odom's side since he was found in extremely critical condition Oct. 13 at the Love Ranch brothel in Crystal, Nevada, and hospitalized in Las Vegas. \nThe brothel said workers saw him drink alcohol and take supplements sold as \"herbal Viagra.\" The Food and Drug Administration issued a warning in 2013 against one brand he took, Reload, after it was found to contain sildenafil, the active ingredient in prescription Viagra. \nHe also told at least one of the women that he had done cocaine, but the brothel said it did not see him take any drugs. \nLove Ranch owner Dennis Hof has said that Odom arrived Oct. 10 for a four-day stay and spent $75,000 on two women who accompanied him in a VIP suite. \nTest results from blood samples obtained through a warrant still are pending, and authorities have not ruled out the possibility of taking action against the brothel or Odom. \n___ \nAP Entertainment Writer Anthony McCartney contributed to this article.
