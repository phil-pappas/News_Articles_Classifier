I am unhappy because we needed to win the match.\"\nArgentina face Brazil next, when qualifying resumes in November.\nIt's not clear if Messi will be back from a serious knee injury by then, while Brazil will be able to welcome back the suspended Neymar.\nIn Quito, Ecuador showed no sign of a letdown in the wake of their win over Argentina last week.\nAmid torrential rain and puddles of standing water on the pitch, Ecuador were clearly stronger.\nConditions improved in the second half, and Ecuador broke through in the 81st through Miller Bolanos, with Felipe Caicedo adding a penalty in injury time.\nThe difficulty of the conditions and the solid efforts of Boliva goalkeeper Daniel Vaca kept Ecuador at bay for some time.\nSubstitute Juan Cazares hit the post in the 79th minute, and two minutes later Cazares's pass was exploited by Bolanos, who fired home an angled shot from the right.\nFive minutes into injury time, Caicedo sealed the win with a penalty straight up the middle after he was taken down by a diving Vaca.\nIn Montevideo, captain Diego Godin led the way for Uruguay.\nGodin opened the scoring in the 34th with a header past Colombian keeper David Ospina in the 34th minute. Striker Diego Rolan doubled the lead in the 51st and second-half substitute Abel Hernandez added the insurance goal in the 88th.\nIn Lima, Alexis Sanchez and Eduardo Vargas scored two goals apiece for Chile in the 4-3 win over Peru.\nSanchez opened the scoring in the seventh. Peru equalized in the 10th through Jefferson Farfan, but were reduced to 10 men in the 23rd when Christian Cueva was sent off.\nPeru still managed to seize the lead when Farfan converted a penalty in the 36th, but Vargas answered in the 41st and Sanchez put Chile ahead with his second goal in the 44th.\nVargas made it 4-2 just minutes after the break, Peru trimming the margin with Paolo Guerrero's goal in injury time.\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:49:05.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
