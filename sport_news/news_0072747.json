(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) SEATTLE -- On a short week the Seahawks get their time to shine in prime time with their annual appearance on Thursday night football. The Seahawks are 14-2 in prime time games under Pete Carroll, and at 2-4 the Seahawks are at a critical point in their season. They could easily be 4-2 if it wasn't for consecutive weeks with 4th quarter meltdowns, but they're not. The Seahawks find themselves in a hole they need to fight and claw to get out of and fast. Another loss and they will sink further into the crowded abyss of NFL teams loaded with talent that just can't get it together. Here are some things to watch in what has become a must-win Thursday night game against the 49ers. 1) The Defense. This is the number one focus on every \"what to watch\" list for this game. The defense melted down two weeks in a row, letting wins slip away. Last week was probably the low point for this defensive unit, allowing the go ahead touchdown for the Panthers to score on a miscommunication between the players in the secondary. It was an ugly way to lose. The Seahawks 4th quarter problems are baffling. Through quarters 1-3 this season the defense ranks 3rd in the NFL in points allowed, in the 4th quarter they rank 28th. Another 4th quarter meltdown against the 49ers has the potential to sink this team. The LOB met for some time after Sunday's loss. They're the most celebrated part of the team, and they need to lead the way against the 49ers tonight and for the rest of this season. 2) 3rd Down Conversions.One way the offense can help the Seahawks defense considerably is by converting on 3rd down, and sustaining some long drives to give the defense some rest and more importantly, eventually score some points. The Seahawks are ranked 20th in the NFL on 3rd down conversions at 36.9%, and flat out need to be better. Three and outs will no longer cut it for a team desperately trying to get back to .500.3) Jermaine Kearse and Doug Baldwin. Russell Wilson connected with Jimmy Graham 8 times for 140 yards against the Panthers, but the Graham-centric offense left Doug Baldwin with only 3 receptions while Jermaine Kearse didn't catch one pass. The Seahawks offense functions best when Russell Wilson spreads the ball around and gets everyone involved. If Kearse and Baldwin are touching the ball more it will only open up the field for the entire offense, running game included. 4) Offensive Line. Corresponding with #3 on our \"what to watch\" list, Russell Wilson can't make any throws to receivers if he is flat on his back. Again last week Wilson was sacked too often, 4 times to be exact. Through 6 games Wilson has been sacked an NFL leading 26 times, for offensive line players that is one category you don't want to be listed as the top team. The Seahawks can't go out and sign an all pro lineman, the next Walter Jones is not about to appear from the practice squad. Tom Cable knows he has to go with the guys he has, and somehow make it work. Pete Carroll has said it is only a matter of time before the guys on the O- line click. Tonight against the 49ers is a good time to start clicking and give Wilson the protection he needs to make throws to his receivers. 5) Energy and attitude. The only thing that can save the Seahawks season is the Seahawks. Last week they were embarrassed in their loss to Carolina. The Seahawks have been doubted and poked fun at all week long in the national media for their inability to close out games. At 2-4 they are looking like a moderately good NFL team that is loaded with talent but can't get it together for 4 quarters of football. For many of the players in the Seahawks locker room, that have been on the wonderful ride that comes with back to back Super Bowl appearances, this is their big first taste of NFL adversity. How they respond, the energy and attitude they bring into the game Thursday night will say a lot about where this season is headed.The NFC Championship Seahawks teams of the past 2 years played a vicious brand of football that was relentless until the final second of the final quarter. That brand of football needs to return beginning tonight against the 49ers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:45:26.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
