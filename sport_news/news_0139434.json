Given just how much is on the line, a better name for it might be \"The Final Verdict.\"\nAdChoices Several teams' seasons are hinging on the outcomes of this weekend's matches, and while some are trying to cap dream seasons with one final victory before the playoffs, some traditional powers are facing the prospect of missing out on the postseason altogether.\nMORE: Best photos from USA-Mexico | Sizing up USMNT player pool ahead of World Cup qualifying\nConsider: The Seattle Sounders and Sporting Kansas City have both been among the league's best teams in recent years, but each could wind up missing the playoffs if things don't go their way on Sunday. Sporting KC already has the U.S. Open Cup in the trophy case this year, but missing the postseason would be a crushing blow for Peter Vermes' side. The Sounders have endured an injury-filled season that once seemed destined for multiple trophies, and suddenly Sigi Schmid is essentially coaching for his job.\nFor the conference champion New York Red Bulls and FC Dallas, Sunday presents an opportunity to put a bow on outstanding seasons. The Red Bulls can win their second Supporters' Shield in three seasons by beating the Chicago Fire, while FC Dallas can swoop in and win it if the Red Bulls stumble.\nHere is Goal's guide to the major stories surrounding the latest league action in MLS:\nIT'S A BIG WEEKEND FOR . . . THE PORTLAND TIMBERS\nWhat a difference two weeks can make.\nNot too long ago, it looked as though the Timbers might miss the playoffs for a second straight season, raising questions about the team's future and the future of coach Caleb Porter. The Timbers responded with a pair of impressive road victories, capped by last week's emphatic 5-2 thrashing of the LA Galaxy.\nNow, rather than having fears of another failed season dominate the conversation in the Rose City, the talk is of just how far the Timbers can go. They could finish as high as second in the West, and they also happen to be facing the weakest opponent among the teams that are contending for that No. 2 seed.\nOf course, you can't take anything for granted when it comes to the Timbers being at home. In the past month alone the team has suffered losses in matches it would have been expected to win. There was the loss to a Red Bulls side that had just flown cross-country after playing a midweek match. Then there was the loss to a Sporting KC side that had just won the U.S. Open Cup\nAs concerning as those home losses were, they seemed to light a fire under the Timbers, who responded with three impressive road victories, including wins in Columbus and against a Galaxy team that had the best home record in the league at the time.\nKeying the turnaround has been a combination of improved work by the midfield and the resurgence of striker Fanendo Adi. With a hot forward, an in-form midfield and an improved defense, the Timbers could make things happen in the playoffs.\nOf course, the Timbers still have to qualify, and a win against the Colorado Rapids on Sunday would make that a reality.\nDON'T MISS . . . SPORTING KANSAS CITY vs. LA GALAXY\nNot too long ago, this looked like a potential Western Conference final preview, but Sporting KC's recent struggles have turned this into a must-win match for Vermes' side. The Galaxy want to finish the regular season on a positive note after last week's blowout loss to the Timbers — and they want to secure a first-round bye in the playoffs as they defend their MLS Cup championship.\nSporting KC's fall is a bit of a head-scratcher. After winning the U.S. Open Cup final last month, and then posting an impressive win in Portland, the club looked poised for a strong run to end the season, but consecutive losses have left the team on the verge of missing the playoffs altogether. Is it a case of fatigue, or a case of a team that might have taken the foot off the gas after lifting a trophy three weeks ago?\nThe Galaxy's struggles go all the way back to August, when they transformed from unstoppable force to beatable squad. The offense was the issue at first — LA failed to score in three straight — but lately the normally stingy defense has been showing cracks.\nSo which will happen? Will Sporting KC's suddenly stalled attack wake up, or will the Galaxy's defense recapture its lost mojo? We'll find out on Sunday in a match that is sure to have a playoff feel.\nKEEP AN EYE ON . . . THE SUPPORTERS' SHIELD RACE\nWe are down to two teams, the Red Bulls and FC Dallas, and thanks to a schedule change they will be playing at the same time as they try to secure the prize for the best regular-season record.\nThe Red Bulls are the favorites to secure the shield, needing just a win. Beating lowly Chicago would seem like a simple enough task, but New York suffered a 3-2 loss at Toyota Park just two months ago. The circumstances around that loss were fluky, with the Red Bulls coming off a bye week and looking flat against a Fire side that took advantage of defensive mistakes.\nIf the Fire can work that same magic again, then the door would be open for FC Dallas to win a trophy few could have envisioned when the season began. Even coach Oscar Pareja said he couldn't have imagined such an accomplishment for a team so young. Pareja has his side playing with confidence and fearlessness. While it isn't necessarily an imposing side, the results speak for themselves.\nFC Dallas isn't facing a pushover in its finale, however. The San Jose Earthquakes are still alive in the playoff race, and an upset win would put them in position to reach the postseason if Portland loses, or if Seattle or Sporting KC fails to win. It won't be easy for the Quakes; FC Dallas is tied for the most home wins in league play.\nTHE BIG ISSUE . . . SEATTLE'S DO-OR-DIE MOMENT\nThe Sounders were a popular preseason pick to win the MLS Cup, and maybe more. It wasn't hard to understand why, what with the dynamic duo of Clint Dempsey and Obafemi Martins leading a team that was coming off a Supporters' Shield.\nThings haven't quite gone according to plan, though. After a promising start, the Sounders endured a rough summer that saw Martins and Dempsey miss months of time with injuries and international duty. Osvaldo Alsonso also missed considerable time, leaving the Sounders scrambling to stay afloat until their stars returned. Some summer transfers looked like they might provide the necessary boost, but the subsequent loss of newly acquired defender Roman Torres, coupled with the loss of form by Dempsey, worked to prevent a complete rebound.\nNow the Sounders need to beat Real Salt Lake to avoid missing the playoffs for the first time in the club's MLS history. Failing to reach the postseason could spell the end of Sigi Schmid's time in charge of the team. With rumors about Jason Kreis possibly being dismissed from NYCFC swirling, it isn't difficult to envision who would be lined up to take Schmid's place.\nThe Sounders can avoid that fate by beating a team that has already been eliminated from the playoffs, although RSL, which features the likes of Nick Rimando, Javier Morales and Kyle Beckerman, is very much a spoiler threat.\nUltimately, Seattle needs a strong showing from its stars, including Dempsey, who has been in a serious funk since the Gold Cup. If Dempsey can't find his form, making the playoffs may not mean much because the Sounders won't get very far without the U.S. national team star playing well.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/soccer-news/4658999-usmnt-us-mens-national-soccer-team-roster-2018-world-cup-qualifying-jurgen-klinsmann", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4657834-fifa-confederations-cup-playoff-usa-mexico-soccer-photos-pictures-deandre-yedlin-arturo-rivas-jermaine-jones"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:43:59.212+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
