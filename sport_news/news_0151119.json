The Lady Indians (19-20, 6-1) will look to defend its region championship while trying to build momentum heading into the state playoffs. This year's schedule, which came after a trip to last year's Class Final Four, has included a bevy of stateranked and out-of-state opponents to beef up the schedule. \nNewnan's schedule also has included a non-region victory against state power McIntosh, defeating the Lady Chiefs in four sets. \nThe Lady Cougars, led by seniors Jenni Young, Anna Brumby, Meg Oldham, and Ansley Knight, have won six of their last seven matches, including beating Northgate 2-0 in the last regular season contest earlier this week while also falling to Sandy Creek. \nEast Coweta has revenge on its mind heading into the tournament. \nAfter advancing to the Final Four a year ago, East Coweta played one of the toughest non-region schedules in the state, losing to state powers such as Woodward Academy, and Woodstock. \nHowever, the Lady Indians knocked off Roswell twice among their non-region wins. \nAfter losing to Newnan, East Coweta swept through the remaining area portion of the schedule without losing a set. \nOne of the keys this season for the Lady Cougars was replacing Jessi Bartholomew, now a freshman at Duke University. \nSeniors Sydney Winters and Dominique Ingram have picked up the slack for the Lady Indians. Winters enters the tournament with 290 kills, while Ingram has 275 kills and 80 blocks. \nRiley Padgett has 35 aces and 387 digs, and Peyton Smith 25 aces and 118 digs. \nOther first-round a games include No. 4 Douglas County (27-10, 4-3) vs No. 6 Pebblebrook (4-12, 2-5) and No. 3 Campbell (15-9, 5-2) vs. No. 5 Westlake (13-12, 3-4), both at 5:30. \nTwo losers bracket games are also scheduled tonight at 7:30. \nThe Area 3- tournament resumes Saturday at 9:30 a.m.. A best three-out-offive championship match is scheduled for 2 p.m. More", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T09:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:31:34.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
