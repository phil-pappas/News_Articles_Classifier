Teresa Evans filed the lawsuit Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court. The complaint alleges racial harassment creating a hostile work environment, discrimination and retaliation. The suit seeks unspecified damages.\nAn LAPD spokesman declined to comment on the suit Monday.\nDorner, who lived with his mother in La Palma, promised warfare on LAPD officers and their families for what he believed was his unjustified termination.\nThe 33-year-old Navy reserve officer killed four people during his nearly one-week run from authorities, including Riverside police Officer Michael Crain and San Bernardino County sheriff’s Deputy Jeremiah MacKay. The rampage also wounded Riverside police Officer Andrew Tachias and San Bernardino County sheriff’s Deputy Alex Collins.\nHe died a few days later from a self-inflicted gunshot wound during a February 2013 confrontation with authorities at a cabin in the unincorporated San Bernardino Mountains community of Angelus Oaks.\nDorner reported Evans to LAPD supervisors for allegedly kicking a suspect three times in 2007. In 2009, the LAPD found in favor of Evans.\nDorner was charged with making false statements against a fellow officer. The LAPD decided to fire Dorner in September 2008 for lying about the incident and he was formally terminated in February 2009.\nBefore his death, Dorner wrote an online manifesto on his Facebook page, threatening to harm police officials and their families. Part of what Dorner wrote dealt with his accusations of alleged excessive force by Evans.\nEvans' lawsuit maintains she was harassed by LAPD supervisors due to the “racial tension sparked by Dorner” and because of her complaints that she was being discriminated against because of her race. The suit states she was denied overtime and transferred from a prestigious assignment to one with less stature.\nEvans' ability to earn a promotion was “completely destroyed” in the aftermath of Dorner's claims, the suit alleges.\n“Because (Evans) was a Caucasian, she was subjected to adverse employment actions by the department as a result of the allegations made against her by Dorner,” who was black, the suit states. “This despite the fact that he was terminated for his own misconduct which had no connection to plaintiff.”\nThe LAPD knew about past misconduct by Dorner while working for the department, the suit states. The officer accidentally shot himself in the hand, assaulted a classmate during LAPD training, lied about being in military combat and failed the department's psychological exam, the suit alleges.�", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/s-defaultcourts.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/s-defaultcourts.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:24:38.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
