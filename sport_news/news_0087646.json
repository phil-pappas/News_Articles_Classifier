Mandatory Credit: Russ Isabella-USA TODAY Sports (Photo: Russ Isabella-USA TODAY Sports) \nDon't call it a bye week. \nASU head coach Todd Graham prefers to say it's an extra week. \nAnd he would prefer his team use the week to clean up its errors. \n\"We have action items that we're working to get better on... communication, ball security, and takeaways\" Graham told reporters on Tuesday. \n\"We're getting an awful lot of TFLs (tackles for loss) and sacks. We need to get the ball out.\" ASU had 5 sacks in Saturday's 34-18 loss at Utah, but had 0 turnovers. \nGraham wants his players to get better with fundamentals such as blocking and screen pass awareness. He is also putting a focus on execution of plays, and that's not lost on his quarterback Mike Bercovici. \n\"It's little things,\" Bercovici said after Tuesday practice. \"It's placement of the football. We got to be able to run the football down there (in the red zone). It's something that we continue to improve going into the 8th game of the year.\" \nThe 8th game will take place Thursday, October 29th. It's a 7:30pm kickoff against Oregon at Sun Devil Stadium.
