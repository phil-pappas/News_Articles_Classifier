Derek Wolfe, who played high school football at Beaver Local (between Minerva and East Liverpool), returned from a four-game suspension imposed after he tested positive for a performance-enhancing substance. Wolfe’s reputation as a tough run defender played out in his first game back against Oakland. Two Raiders running backs ran 19 times for 52 yards (2.7 average). Wolfe told Denver writers he felt like “a caged animal” before getting on the field against Oakland. “(The suspension) was awful,’’ Wolfe said. “I’ve had to sit before and watch because of injury, but when you’re perfectly healthy and you’re just chomping and you feel the best you’ve ever felt, there’s nothing worse.’’ Wolfe, who played college ball at Cincinnati, was the No. 36 overall pick of the 2012 draft, taken one spot before the Browns picked right tackle Mitchell Schwartz. They will line up against each other at times Sunday. Browns defensive coordinator Jim O’Neil said Wolfe is part of one of the deepest defenses in the league. That depth will be tested if pass rusher DeMarcus Ware can’t play because of a back injury. “Their defense starts with their front,” quarterback Josh McCown said. “Von Miller is exceptional. They are good inside, good outside. “From top to bottom, in every position, they are just good players. It is hard to find a weakness.” Hartline’s playing time O’Neil and offensive coordinator John DeFilippo said they need to get veterans Paul Kruger and Brian Hartline on the field more than they did at Baltimore. Kruger led the team with 11 sacks in 2014. Through five games, he has been in on 11 tackles, only one of them a sack. “I know that the stats haven’t been there,” O’Neil said. “I think Paul went eight games last year without having a sack. Like turnovers, sacks come in bunches. “Paul has done a really good job affecting the quarterback. He’s gotten the quarterback off of his spot. He’s doing a good job getting push on the offensive tackles. “We’re asking him to do a lot of things defensively, and he’s been a real pro and a team guy. Paul is going to get his reps. If you have 60, you’d like Paul to be out there for 40 to 45. You don’t want him out there for every one because he’s your best pass rusher and you want your best pass rushers fresh at times, especially in the fourth quarter.” Page 2 of 3 - Three of McCown’s 51 passes at Baltimore were aimed at Hartline. “I probably need to get Brian on the field a little bit more,” DeFilippo said. “There is no doubt about it. “We spread the ball around so much, which to me is part of the reason we are having a little success. I am high on Brian Hartline, as you guys all know.” Sacking Manning Peyton Manning is sitting out Wednesday practices to allow his 39-year-old body to heal. “It helps him physically as we get to game day,” Broncos head coach Gary Kubiak said. “It’s going to help him in the long haul.” Manning has always been good at avoiding sacks. He has taken 318 in his career, including playoffs. That includes 74 sacks in the three seasons (all with Denver) since he sat out 2011 with a neck injury. The sacks are up this year, though. He has been taken down 12 times in five games after getting sacked 17 times in 16 games in 2014. More from Ward Brown-turned-Bronco T.J. Ward is having some fun with Browns-Broncos week. • On Cleveland’s offense: “A big tight end, small guys on the outside, fast guys on the outside, and they like to throw a lot. It kind of fits perfect to what we like to do, too, right?” • On heading into a bye week after facing his old team: “It would be great to hit the bye unbeaten, going into a big game against Green Bay.” • On Cleveland: “It’s a second home. I still talk to a lot of people there. I went back this summer and it was like I never left.” • On the game: “It’s going to be a good day for us.” Extra points • McCown’s worst decision at Baltimore was to throw while he was getting decked. He was bailed out of an interception by a roughing-the-passer call. His head bounced off the turf, raising fears about the concussion that knocked him out of seven quarters last month. “In the moment, it didn’t feel good,” McCown said of getting his head slammed, “but it wasn’t anything serious. Thankfully, the interception got nullified. “When you have a play like that, you kind of deserve getting your head bounced.” • During his weekly mid-week press briefing, someone asked Manning if he still is bumming over not leading Tennessee to a national championship. Page 3 of 3 - “Is this deep-question Wednesday?” Manning said. • While John Elway conducted “The Drive” in the 1986 AFC title game at Cleveland, Kubiak was a backup Broncos quarterback. The game ended in overtime on a controversial field goal deemed by some observers behind the goal post to have been wide. “It might have had some paint on it,” Kubiak said, “but I think it was good.” • Kubiak was behind John Elway on Denver’s roster from 1983-84. His record as a starter was 3-2.
