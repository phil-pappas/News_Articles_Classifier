Austin 28-27. \nLamar owned the tiebreaker over Sam Houston State after defeating them 49-46 in Week 3, so a win over the Demons would have put the Cardinals into a second place tie with Central Arkansas. \nInstead, Woodard's Cardinals are going to need luck, and no more stale performances like Saturday against the Demons, to regain their confidence and conference title aspirations. \n\"We let one go against Northwestern State and that's on me,\" Woodard said. \"We don't control our destiny anymore. For the most part, we were outcoached and outplayed.\" \nRELATED: Cardinals defense on brink of complete game \nIt was Lamar's worst showing of the season and it came against — at least record wise — the worse team in the conference. \n\"All losses hurt,\" Cardinals running back Kade Harrington said. \"But we really missed an opportunity. We came out a little flat and they jumped on us.\" \nHarrington believes the Cardinals still have a chance of reaching its goals, but knows the loss to the Demons was a major setback. \n\"We just have to bounce back,\" Harrington said. \"We're all here to win and that's all that matters. So that's what we're going to have to do the rest of the way.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:10:58.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
