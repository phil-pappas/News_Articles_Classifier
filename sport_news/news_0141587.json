After all, the Yankees don't know two things. \nThey aren't sure whether they'll have home-field advantage in the elimination game, though it's probable they will. Any combination of a Yankees victory or Astros loss over the next three days will clinch it. \nAnd they don't know their the Wild Card opponent. \nWe've ranked the teams they would want to battle most below. \n1. Minnesota Twins (83-76) Record vs. Yankees in 2015: 1-5 \nWhy the Yankees want to face them: The Yankees have owned the Twins in four straight American League Division Series — 2003, 2004, 2009 and 2010. Plus, nobody on the Twins' pitching staff gives you chills. \nWhy they don't: Miguel Sano had a pair of two homer games at Yankee Stadium in August. The rest of their offense, led by powerful second baseman Brian Dozier (28 homers), isn't too shabby either. \n2. Los Angeles Angels (83-76) \nRecord vs. Yankees in 2015: 2-4 \nWhy the Yankees want to face them: Lefty Andrew Haney (6-3, 3.29 ERA) will start against the Yankees. Haney lacks experience, but he's been one of the best rookie pitchers in the game, and the Yankees hate facing lefties. \nWhy they don't: Two names: Mike Trout and Albert Pujols, two of the game's most dangerous hitters. Also, top-notch closer Huston Street (groin) might be healthy enough to return. \n3. Houston Astros (84-75) \nRecord vs. Yankees in 2015: 4-3 \nWhy the Yankees want to face them: The Astros are much worse on the road (31-47) than they are at home (52-28), and the Yankees are in good position to play host. Also, while Houston could throw at them lefty starting pitcher Dallas Keuchel, who's held the Yankees scoreless over 16 innings this year, he'd be going on short rest. \nWhy they don't: Five Astros — Evan Gattis (27), Chris Carter (24), Luis Valbuena (24), Colby Rasmus (22) and Carlos Correa (21) — have hit 21 or more home runs and Masahiro Tanaka, the Yankees' Wild Card starting pitcher, is homer-prone, especially at in the Bronx. \nBrendan Kuty may be reached at bkuty@njadvancemedia.com .
