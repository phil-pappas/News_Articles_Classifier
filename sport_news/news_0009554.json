It's the third commissioning of a new runway in seven years and the public's mood has darkened since a jubilant celebration marking the first one in 2008. Compared to previous openings, today's opening ceremony was more subdued without high-ranking congressmen or senators attending, although former U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood was present. Runway 10-Right/28-Left is located on the far south airfield and is expected to handle primarily flights arriving from the west. That's got suburbanites in nearby Bensenville and Wood Dale and as far away as St. Charles and Wayne wondering how they'll fare in the game of noise roulette. Bensenville Mayor Frank Soto was one dignitary who didn't attend Thursday's ceremonies. \"Certainly, I'm not looking forward to it being here,\" Soto said. He regretted that pushback from United and American airlines over financing had forced Chicago to delay plans to build a runway and extend an existing one on the north airfield, which could have moved some jet noise away from his town. \"Unfortunately, the other two runways that should have been built ... are not built yet and people are being inundated and will have a disproportionate share of the flights until those runways are completed.\" Chicago Aviation Commissioner Ginger Evans has promised a more equal distribution of noise in 2021 when six parallel runways are complete. Until then the new runway will be used mainly for arrivals from the west and operate from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily. The city switched to an east/west flow of air traffic in 2013. Although easing off certain diagonal runways has relieved communities north of the airport, the shift drew instant consternation from communities in both Chicago and the suburbs who have complained of a constant racket. Currently, 30 percent of O'Hare is in \"east flow,\" in which jets land from the west and depart to the east. The new runway should handle about 125 flights landing from the west (11.8 percent of total O'Hare arrivals) between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., the FAA projects. Adding to the controversy are calls to keep two diagonal runways open although the city already retired one this summer. Advocates of the diagonals argue they're the key to evenly spreading out the jet din. Evans has said the parallel system is safer and more efficient because it avoids a crisscross situation. The new runway is \"critically important to improve safety and security of airfield,\" she said. A new $45 million air traffic control tower also opened today to watch over 10-Right/28-Left flights. The runway will be a little different from its peers because pilots are being instructed to approach the runway from a 2.5-degree angle to the south, then straighten out within five to 10 miles of landing. This tactic is known as an offset, and is necessary because 10R/28L falls slightly short of the required space between it and the nearest runway (10-Center/28-Center). In tandem with the offset, pilots will follow a special \"precision runway monitor\" (PRM) approach aimed at preventing any midair collisions or near-misses. It boils down to an air traffic controller operating a separate radio frequency and issuing warnings if one airplane is drifting too close to another or if a go-round is necessary. The offset's impact on noise will be watched closely in the coming days. Beverly Barker of Roselle is affected by two runways. \"I not only get it from one runway but two and they are in sync,\" she said. \" And, now they are having another runway going to open for a total of three runways going east-west. There is no help for us out here.\" Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:20:44.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
