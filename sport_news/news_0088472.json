According to a release sent out just now by Bristol’s big red PR machine: \n“Jessica Mendoza will become the first female analyst to call a nationally televised MLB postseason game” on Tuesday night when ESPN broadcasts the AL Wild Card play-in game at 7 pm central. \nAs of Oct. 1st, the New York Yankees currently have a two and a half game lead atop the AL Wild Card standings. The Houston Astros currently hold the second AL Wild Card spot, with the Los Angeles Angels only a half game behind. Obviously, the World Wide Leader is rooting hard for a Yankees-Angels matchup (#1 market vesus #2). \nMendoza is also an athletic ambassador for Team Darfur and board member of the National Education Association. She joined ESPN’s Baseball Tonight in March of 2014. \nMendoza has previous experience as a color analyst during the Women’s College World Series and as a sideline reporter for ESPNU. You’ve probably also seen her a couple times during college football bowl season too. \nJessica Mendoza is also a very accomplished former softball player for the Stanford Cardinal and Team USA. \nShe also played professionally. The 34-year-old won gold with the United States Women’s National Team in Athens as well as a silver medal in Beijing. Jessica Mendoza was also a four time All-American during her college career. \n\n  \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:38:13.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
