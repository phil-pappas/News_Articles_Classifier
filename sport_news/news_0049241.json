(AP) - While much of Aldon Smith’s focus will be on trying to bring down Denver quarterback Peyton Manning, Oakland’s pass rusher also will be in a little competition with the Broncos’ edge rushers. \nWith Smith and teammate Khalil Mack on one side and Denver’s DeMarcus Ware and Von Miller on the other, the game Sunday between the Raiders (2-2) and Broncos (4-0) will feature some of the best pass rushers around. \n“There’s definitely going to be some talent out there, with all of us,” Smith said. “Just the competitive nature of us, we all want to compete and prove who is the best out of all of us.” \nDenver’s group has been tops so far this season with an NFL-best 18 sacks through four games that has the Broncos on pace to tie the single-season sacks record of 72 set by Chicago in 1984. \nDenver’s revamped defense under new coordinator Wade Phillips, who replaced current Raiders coach Jack Del Rio, has gotten sacks from 11 players, led by Ware’s 4 1/2. \nDerek Carr has made major strides in dealing with pressure in his second season as Raiders quarterback, but he will have to be at the top of his game against this defense. \n“He’s a pretty good decision maker,” Del Rio said. “I think we’ve done a pretty solid job on picking things up and we’ll have a great challenge this weekend, because they do a really good job with their pressure and with their coverage behind it.” \nOakland’s pass rushers haven’t been nearly as prolific with just eight sacks. But Smith is finding his groove after signing two days before the season opener, and the Broncos have struggled to protect Manning, allowing 10 sacks. \nThe line will need to do a better job against Smith and Mack. \n“Everybody has to account for them,” Manning said. “Obviously, receivers have to get open on time. Obviously, offensive line has to be on top of all communications. You have to just account for those guys because both of them can create turnovers and cause long down-and-distances.” \nHere are some other things to watch when the Broncos visit the Raiders: \nCLASS OF ‘98: Manning and Raiders safety Charles Woodson are two of the three remaining active players from the 1998 draft class, along with Indianapolis backup quarterback Matt Hasselbeck. This will be the ninth meeting between Woodson and Manning, the top two finishers in the 1997 Heisman Trophy balloting. Woodson is still seeking his first interception against Manning despite having 62 in his career. \nDEL RIO’S REUNION: Del Rio spent the past three seasons as defensive coordinator in Denver and knows the team well. Del Rio said despite the system changes under new coach Gary Kubiak, the Broncos still look familiar. Both Del Rio and his former players are downplaying the reunion. \n“A lot of people look at it as defense versus defense, Jack’s defense versus Wade’s defense, but in our eyes, it’s Broncos versus Raiders,” Broncos linebacker Danny Trevathan said. \nTIGHT END TROUBLE: For four weeks, the Raiders have been unable to cover tight ends. Despite shifts in scheme and in coverage responsibilities, the tight end has continually been left open for big catches. Tight ends have combined for 32 catches for 388 yards and six touchdowns this season against the Raiders. That could bode well for Owen Daniels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:50:25.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
