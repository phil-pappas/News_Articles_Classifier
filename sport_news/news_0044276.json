HC opened the scoring in the first quarter when massive offensive lineman Hunter Hudgins fell on a fumble by Crusaders quarterback Peter Pujols in the end zone for his first career touchdown. It gives the 6-foot-5, 298-pound Hudgins huge bragging rights on the Mount St. James campus.\n“It was nice, although I’d much rather we didn’t fumble. But, it’s nice to have a guy, who is in the right position and knows what to do,” said Holy Cross coach Tim Gilmore.\nThe Crusaders scored off a 67-yard punt return for touchdown by Kalif Raymond, a 26-yard field goal by Connor Fitzgerald, as well as three TD tosses by Pujols, including a pair to Brendan Flaherty of Beverly.\nThe defensive effort was led by linebacker Nick McBeath, who had six tackles, two forced fumbles and a sack plus linebacker Kyle Young, who added four tackles and caused a fumble.\n“It was a complete team win,” Gilmore said. “We’ve had a great attitude. You know, coming off a disappointing game (31-14 loss to Colgate), there’s only two ways you can go and the guys really responded. We took a very focused and aggressive path to practice and it really showed on Saturday.”\n“We’ve had our ups and downs with injuries and we’ve had to move guys around in the lineup, but the guys have responded,” Gilmore said. “It was really important for us to come back and get a win.”\nUNH pickin’ and cruisin’\nTo the north, 20th-ranked New Hampshire (3-2) entered Saturday’s 37-14 win over Elon (2-3) without making an interception through the initial four games. But, against the Phoenix, the UNH made five picks. The football theft artists included defensive back Casey DeAndrade of East Bridgewater, linebacker Ryan Farrell of Westwood, defensive back Lamar Edmonds of Worcester, defensive back D’Andre Drummond Mayrie of Lawrence and linebacker Akil Anderson.\nNot to be overlooked on the offensive side, running back Dalton Crossan had a career night with 22 carries for 140 yards and four TDs. It was the first 100-yard game for Crossan, who missed most of last season due to injury.\nFirst time’s a charm\nUMass halted a five-game slide dating to last season with a rousing 24-14 victory over Florida International in Amherst.\nQuarterback Blake Frohnapfel was, ahem, sharp, completing 32-of-42 passes for 363 yards. His prime target was Tajae Sharpe, who had 15 grabs to break a school record he shared with three other receivers for catches in a game. He had a game-high 159 receiving yards. Marken Michel did his best to step out from under Sharpe’s shadow with personal bests for receptions (seven), receiving yards (113) and TDs (two) in a game. It was the second time this season UMass had two receivers with 100-plus receiving yards.\n“There was an anxiety a little bit on the sideline,” UMass coach Mark Whipple said. “I think it was kind of from the Temple thing, clearing our mind and now we’re over that hump. I think it’s really easy to get one, not that it’s going to be easy to get win No. 2, but there was a different feeling in that locker room that we didn’t have any time last year.”\nMilestone by Crimson coach\nHarvard, which owns the nation’s second longest Division 1 win streak (17 games), continued to roll with a 45-0 pasting of Georgetown as the Crimson ran their all-time record in night games to 11-0. The win was coach Tim Murphy’s 150th victory (150-62-0) in 22 seasons at Harvard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:35:09.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
