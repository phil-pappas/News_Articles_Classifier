But he missed wide right. However, the Browns were called for offside and Lambo’s second attempt, from 34 yards, was successful and he was mobbed by team-mates.\nThe Browns (1-3) had tied it at 27 on Josh McCown’s one-yard pass to Gary Barnidge with 2:09 to play and a two-point conversion pass to Taylor Gabriel. That score was set up when the Browns won a challenge of McCown’s 19-yard pass to Barnidge that originally was ruled incomplete.\nPhilip Rivers was 23 of 38 for 358 yards and three touchdowns for San Diego (2-2). McCown was 32 of 41 for 356 yards and two scores.\nLambo was with FC Dallas for three years but never made a first-team appearance. He enrolled at Texas A&M in 2012 where he became the team’s kicker, and was signed as a free agent by the Chargers this season after going undrafted.\nIn Denver, Brandon McManus kicked a 39-yard field goal with 1:51 left and the Broncos had seven sacks in their 23-20 win over the Minnesota Vikings .\nVon Miller smothered the loose ball after TJ Ward’s sack-strip of Teddy Bridgewater in the closing seconds, sealing the win for the unbeaten Broncos (4-0), who got a 72-yard touchdown run from Ronnie Hillman.\nPeyton Manning has led his teams to a 4-0 start seven times, the most in NFL history by a long shot. Next up at four is Fran Tarkenton. Manning also joined Brett Favre as the only QB to win 100 home starts in the NFL . It wasn’t a great day for Manning, who was picked off twice by the Vikings (2-2).\nAdrian Peterson ran for a 48-yard touchdown to pull Minnesota to 20-17 and cap a 97-yard drive with 10 minutes left.\nElsewhere, Todd Gurley rushed for all but five of 146 yards in the second half and the St Louis Rams held on to hand the Arizona Cardinals their first loss of the season, 24-22.\nGurley, the Rams’ first-round draft pick, saw his most extensive action as a pro and his 52-yard run set up what proved to be the winning touchdown.\nNick Foles threw for three touchdowns, two after Arizona turnovers, and St Louis’ defense held the Cardinals (3-1) to field goals on four of five trips inside the red zone.\nArizona had a third-and-2 at the Rams 43 in the final minutes, but Carson Palmer overthrew receivers on consecutive plays to turn the ball over on downs. The Rams (2-2) are 2-0 against the NFC West.\nOnce Aaron Rodgers and Co warmed up in the second half, the Green Bay Packers kept their unbeaten start rolling.\nRodgers passed for 224 yards and a touchdown, ran 17 yards to set up a key second-half score, and the Packers beat the hapless San Francisco 49ers 17-3 for their first 4-0 start in four years.\nRichard Rodgers caught a nine-yard touchdown pass on the game’s opening drive before Rodgers got his team going in the second half after a slow start to snap a four-game losing streak to San Francisco, which included a pair of playoff defeats.\nRelated: New York Jets win in London to heap more misery on Miami Dolphins\nClay Matthews added his own flair to this one. When he sacked Colin Kaepernick in the third quarter, he kissed his right biceps Kaepernick-style to punctuate the play — one of Green Bay’s six sacks.\nWhile methodical with nothing fancy, Green Bay (4-0) seemed unfazed with a short week and long trip West after beating Kansas City last Monday night. This is the team’s first 4-0 start since winning the initial 13 games in 2011.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T08:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:24:19.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
