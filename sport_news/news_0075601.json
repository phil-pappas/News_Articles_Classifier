Mourinho described the FA fine as a “disgrace,” joking that “afraid costs 50,000 pounds. Weak and naive, you can do it.” \nTuesday’s draw left everything to play for in the group with Porto leading the way on seven points from three games, two clear of Dynamo and three ahead of Chelsea. \nAs Mourinho dragged Wenger’s name into the conversation, the Arsenal manager was over 2,000 kilometers away in London, celebrating his team’s 2-0 win over Bayern Munich. After losing both opening matches for the first time, Arsenal desperately needed a win to keep alive its hopes of reaching the knockout round. \nSecond-half goals from France striker Olivier Giroud and German playmaker Mesut Ozil ended Bayern’s run of 12 straight wins. Giroud scored in the 77th minute at the Emirates Stadium, bundling the ball into the net after Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer rushed off his line and failed to claim a free-kick from Santi Cazorla. \nThe ball appeared to come off Giroud’s arm last, after first hitting his head as he dived to make contact. \nChampion Barcelona remained in control of top spot in Group E as Ivan Rakitic scored both goals in a 2-0 win at BATE Borisov, while Roma came back from a 0-2 deficit in a 4-4 draw at Bayer Leverkusen in a topsy-turvy game. Olympiakos won 1-0 at Dinamo Zagreb.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:22:00.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
