Campbell, who said the military will ensure transparency in investigating the incident, did not specify if the air strike had struck the Medecins Sans Frontieres hospital. “We have now learned that on October 3 Afghan forces advised that they were taking fire from enemy positions and asked for air support from US forces,” US General John Campbell said in a briefing with reporters. “An air strike was then called to eliminate the Taliban threat and several civilians were accidentally struck.” Campbell’s comments differed from the initial reports that indicated that US forces were threatened and that the air strike was called on their behalf. Raid ‘profound tragedy’: US\nMeanwhile, the White House said on Monday that the hospital air strike in Kunduz was “a profound tragedy”. US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter has promised “accountability” for the death of innocent civilians in an American air strike on a hospital in Kunduz , saying a transparent investigation has been launched into the incident. The Doctors Without Borders said it had demanded an independent probe into Saturday's air raid. Forces ‘regain’ most of city The police and residents said Afghan government forces had regained control of most of the besieged city of Kunduz on Monday, and some shops in the centre of the provincial capital opened for the first time since it fell to Taliban fighters a week ago. Residents said it was the first time in eight days that they had not heard gun battles and were able to leave their homes to buy food and take stock of the damage done. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:15:13.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
