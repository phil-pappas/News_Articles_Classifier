Non-licensed growing warehouses aren't required to register with the state, so any safety inspections only occur if someone alerts the city or the growers ask for one themselves. Here's part of the city's reasoning, as seen in an excerpt from the bill: \"This gap in regulation has resulted in a proliferation of large-scale, non-licensed and unregulated marijuana grow operations that present significant health and public safety concerns with multiple and persistent violations of city building, electrical, fire, and environmental safety regulations; and whereas, the marijuana produced by these large-scale, unregulated cultivation operations cannot be tracked, making it virtually impossible to verify that this marijuana is distributed in accordance with all applicable laws.\"\nGranted, the number of fires at unregulated grows hasn't reached epidemic proportions, and there's a tendency of the news media to over-hype those that do occur. Note a 2012 fire that prompted CBS4 to characterize grows as what our William Breathes described at the time as \"the electrical-blaze equivalent of a ticking time bomb\" and \"deadly jungles full of booby traps.\" In that case, however, the fire was exceedingly minor and had already been extinguished before firefighters arrived.\nIn this morning's case, black marks can be seen on the portion of the garage visible from the street, and the DFD maintains that damage is more extensive around the back. However, there are no reports of injuries to firefighters or nearby residents.\nHere's the 7News report .\nContact: Michael Roberts Follow: Michael Roberts Westword Westword", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/XQUQP4zWkwk", "https://twitter.com/EricLupher7News/status/657502372789284864", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/denverfire?src=hash", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Michael-RobertsWestword/111180895657427", "https://t.co/WOe3irUOUu", "https://www.facebook.com/DenverWestword", "https://t.co/VJ7DrX0d2B", "http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/fire-damages-garage-that-may-house-marijuana-grow-operation", "http://www.twitter.com/denverwestword", "https://twitter.com/7NewsNOW", "https://twitter.com/CodyCam/status/657496830704402432"], "published": "2015-10-23T13:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:10:43.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
