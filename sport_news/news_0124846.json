The Vietnam War was in full swing, the Civil Rights movement was still fresh in everyone’s mind and the women’s movement was picking up steam.\nDuring her time with the association, it has established a $7 million endowment and Hodgin Hall – the university’s first building that now houses the association – has undergone a major renovation. Last month, the UNM Board of Regents voted to rename the plaza outside of Hodgin Hall the Dr. Karen Abraham Courtyard to honor her contributions to the school.\nColleagues and others who know her say Abraham has a gift for building relationships and making others feel special. Abraham said relationships have been the cornerstone of what she does.\n“It’s all about building a community,” she said. “The basis of everything in life is human connection.”\nBrian Burnett, president and CEO of engineering and surveying firm Bohannan Huston, was president of the Alumni Association when Abraham came on board. He called Abraham a “fantastic person and exceptional leader.” He said Abraham has the unique ability to make anyone she works with feel good and will leave behind an incredible career.\n“She’s one of my favorite people to work with,” he said. “She has a knack of making anybody she works with feel special.”\nKaren Abraham, associate vice president of alumni relations and executive director of the Alumni Association at the University of New Mexico, is retiring. (Roberto E. Rosales/Albuquerque Journal)\nFate intervenes\nAbraham enrolled at UNM as an undergraduate in 1963 and never left.\nBut that wasn’t always her plan.\nBachelor’s of science in education degree in hand, ink barely dry, in 1967 she accepted a job as a teacher. Her ultimate goal was to become a guidance counselor. Then she got a letter in the mail. She had been chosen for a three-year fellowship to earn a doctorate degree but wasn’t sure she wanted to accept it.\n“In those days, there weren’t a lot of role models for women,” she said. “Not a lot of women had doctorates. You either became a teacher, a nurse or a stay-at-home mother.”\nShe accepted the offer and earned a doctor of education, but hadn’t really thought much beyond that. She was offered another teaching job but this time with children with emotional needs, bringing her closer to her goal of becoming a counselor. Fate would intervene once more. Right before starting her new job in 1971, she ran into the dean of students who told her a new position was opening and she should apply.\nThe principal of the school told her he would hold her job but that turned out not to be necessary. She applied and became the assistant dean of students. She would go on to become the associate dean of students and director of student activities before landing her position with the alumni association.\n“You know I’ve read all these books and they say if you want to be successful, you should have a plan,” she said. “I always feel guilty because I’m not good at that. Life has a certain synchronicity to it. Everyone has choices.”\nAlthough her career wasn’t in her plans, it became her life. One she dedicated herself to completely. Abraham is the middle of three children but she never married or had children herself. Her mother was a native New Mexican who met her father in Philadelphia while traveling to the World’s Fair. He moved to New Mexico and the two married. Abraham was born in the 1940s in a New Mexico town that didn’t officially exist at the time.\n“I was born in Los Alamos when it was a secret city,” she said. “My birth certificate says I was born in a post office box.”\nThe family eventually got a real address when they moved to Santa Fe where Abraham and her two siblings were raised.\nKaren Abraham, associate vice president of alumni relations and executive director of the Alumni Association at the University of New Mexico, is in the center enjoying lunch and conversation with her staff at Hodgin Hall on the UNM campus. (Roberto E. Rosales/Albuquerque Journal)\nGo-to person\nAbraham’s brother, Los Ranchos Mayor Larry Abraham, said their mother was a school teacher and both his parents valued education. He said his sister has devoted her life to the job and is irreplaceable, a fact that made his parents proud.\n“She has been the go-to person for more than a dozen (UNM) presidents,” he said. “She is the heart and soul of the university. She has made so many great relationships through that job and I always see that when I’m with her. I know she can leave there with her head held high. She’s leaving it a better place.”\nAttorney and former Alumni Association president Ruth Schifani said Abraham’s funny, smart, kind and devoted personality made her good at her job and also referred to Abraham as the heart and soul of the university.\n“She is wonderful with relationships with people,” she said. “It spans current students to the older alumni. She just manages to bring people together.”\nTrue to who she is, Abraham said she’s made no elaborate plans for retirement. She said there are things she’s been meaning to take care of for the past 45 years that she might get to at some time. Or maybe she won’t.\n“I was telling myself I need to be brilliant about this,” she said. “I asked myself what was on my bucket list and I realized I don’t have one. I’ll just be doing what I do right now – spending time with friends and family and enjoying my time.”", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/life15_jd_11oct_3abraham-400x295.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/life15_jd_11oct_1abraham-400x292.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:19:59.142+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
