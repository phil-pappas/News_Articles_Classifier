He is now ninth in the highest wicket-takers list in Tests.\n\nPakistan had lost opener Mohammad Hafeez (19) and Shoaib Malik (two) in the first session.\n\nEngland introduced spinner Ali as early as the seventh over. Hafeez struck a boundary off the first ball of Ali's fifth over but was caught bat-and-pad by Jonny Bairstow at short leg off the very next delivery.\n\nMalik, who scored a brilliant 245 in the first Test, lasted just nine balls before playing a short-pitched Ben Stokes delivery into the hands of Bairstow, who caught it at the second attempt.\n\nPakistan were boosted by the return of leg-spinner Yasir Shah, who missed the first Test with a back problem, replacing paceman Rahat Ali. England were unchanged from the first Test. The third and final Test will be played in Sharjah from November 1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:54:18.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
