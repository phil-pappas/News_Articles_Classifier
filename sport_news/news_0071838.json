District crowns ready to be claimed By Josh Moore jmoore@herald-leader.com October 22, 2015 Updated 3 hours ago 2015-10-22T17:37:26Z \nYour weekly guide to high school football \nFRIDAY's kickoffs \nCITY GAMES \nHenry Clay (4-4) at No. 8 Bryan Station (6-3), 7:30: After dropping two of its last three, Bryan Station looks to end its regular season on a positive note. Henry Clay pulled away late from Dunbar last week to snap a three-game skid. \nNo. 9 Lafayette (7-2) at Tates Creek (4-4), 7:30: The No. 1 seed in Class 6A, District 8 is on the line in the Roy Walton Bowl after both teams went 2-0 against Madison Central and Clark County. Will Creek rise to the occasion or will the Generals cap the regular season with their fifth straight win? \nNo. 2 Scott County (7-1) at Paul Laurence Dunbar (3-5), 7:30: While it's hard to look at back-to-back losses and smile, Dunbar's losing margins have improved drastically from the beginning of the year. Their \"reward?\" A Cardinals team that tops Class 6A scoring at 49 points a game. \nGarrard County (5-3) at No. 19 Lexington Catholic (5-3), 7:30: LexCath can lock up Class 3A, District 4 with a win over the Golden Lions, who snapped a two-game losing streak last week. Catholic earned one heck of a résumé-building win last week at No. 12 Boyle County. \nDanville (7-1) at Lexington Christian (6-2), 7:30: Becoming the only team not named Boyle County to topple the Admirals would be a big statement if LCA can pull off the upset. These two combined for 115 points last year in a 58-57 scorcher claimed by Danville. \nTOP STATE GAMES \nNo. 19 Johnson Central (7-0) at Ashland Blazer (8-0), 7:30: Class 4A, District 8 gets decided in the town that produced Wynonna Judd, Larry Conley and Chuck Woolery. Will the wheel of fortune spin Blazer's way or does Johnson Central earn its fourth straight win in the series? Blazer has lost each of the previous contests by the same score: 42-7. \nNo. 1 Male (8-0) at No. 7 Manual (7-1), 7:30: Manual has been shaky in recent weeks, losing to St. Xavier at home and needing overtime to edge Pleasure Ridge Park. Male had a time with St. X itself last week, nearly allowing more points (24) than it had in its previous seven games (26). \nRaceland (5-3) at Paintsville (8-0), 7:30: Paintsville claims the No. 1 seed in the three-team Class A, District 6 with a win. A Rams win forces a three-way split with these two and Fairview, whom Raceland lost to last week. \nNo. 6 Bowling Green (7-1) at Greenwood (7-1), 7 CDT: Another No. 1 seed is up for grabs in this intercity \"rivalry.\" Greenwood has never defeated the Purples, who are riding a five-game winning streak, in 23 meetings. Greenwood boasts a five-game streak, too. \nHenry County (7-1) at Central (6-2), 7:30: Henry County has quietly put together a strong season, a one-point loss at Waggener not withstanding. The Yellowjackets own six straight wins and haven't allowed more than seven points in a game in four weeks. \nSouthwestern (7-1) at No. 14 Pulaski County (7-1), 7:30: The county neighbors duke it out for the regular-season Class 5A, District 7 title. Riley Hall is likely to surpass 2,000 yards passing on the season for Pulaski; Patric Edwards could reach 20-plus rushing TDs for Southwestern (he's at 18). \nAnderson County (4-4) at Madison Southern (3-4), 7:30: Madison Southern can earn its first regular-season district title outright with a win over the Bearcats. If Anderson wins and Montgomery County defeats Woodford County, a three-way tie for first place would exist in Class 5A, District 6. \nNo. 11 Ryle (7-1) at No. 4 Simon Kenton (8-0), 7: A clash of Northern Kentucky titans that could end up being a regional finals preview. Ryle stubbed its toe at No. 9 Cooper earlier this month. The Pioneers have steamrolled every opponent since a 52-36 win at Bryan Station in August. \nCollins (4-4) at Shelby County (7-1), 7:30: A win makes Shelby County No. 1 in Class 4A, District 4. Collins needs a victory to finish second in the district (it lost to Spencer County, which lost to the Rockets last week). A Titans win would lock things up for Spencer County and push Shelby potentially down to fourth in the district depending on the outcome of Franklin County-North Oldham. \njosh moore, jmoore@herald-leader.com Josh Moore: (859) 231-1307.
