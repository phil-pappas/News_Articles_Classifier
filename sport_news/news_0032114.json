Mike Nugent tied it with a 31-yard field goal on the final play of regulation. \nNugent was good again from 42 yards with 3:36 left in overtime, the ball deflecting off the left upright before going through. It matched the second-biggest comeback in Cincinnati's history when trailing in the fourth quarter. \nThe Bengals are 5-0 for the first time since 1988, the last time they went to the Super Bowl. \nSeattle (2-3) punted twice in overtime, giving the Bengals a chance to pull it out.
