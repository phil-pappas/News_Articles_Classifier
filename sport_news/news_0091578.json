I think the supporters will need to fasten their seat belts - I'm sure they will really enjoy him. \n\"He seems to be somebody who's not in love with himself, which the Liverpool supporters can relate to. I'm sure they will take him to their hearts. He's described himself as 'the normal one' and that will do them fine because they regard themselves as being pretty normal. \n\"I don't know him - I've only seen snippets on TV or radio but he came across very, very well this morning and I think that augurs well for everybody.\" \nKlopp's reign begins with a difficult trip to Tottenham a week on Saturday, followed by home outings against Rubin Kazan and Southampton in the Europa League and Premier League respectively. \nDalglish added: \"He's got off to a fantastic start but it's a really difficult run of games coming up and I'm sure, as he said this morning, he is going to work as hard as anybody else and if everybody works together it's not rocket science - (if) everybody works together you've got a much better chance of success.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:51:39.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
