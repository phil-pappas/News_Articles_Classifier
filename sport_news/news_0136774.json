He has lauded the ardent fan group several times and he went to greet them during the team's training session on Friday in contradiction with Mansour's instructions.\nFollowing Zamalek's exit from the Confederation Cup semis after their insufficient 3-0 win over Tunisian side Etoile du Sahel, Mansour declared that Omar Gaber, Bassem Morsi and Ali Gaber would be suspended.\nThe first two players were suspended for their sympathy with the ardent fan group while the third for his early red card during the game.\nGaber's current problem with the club president is not the first as they clashed in February when the 23-year-old refused to play in Zamalek's game against ENPPI where 20 of Zamalek's fans were killed while trying to enter the stadium.\nThe player was suspended and referred to investigation but the issue was resolved after a meeting with the club's president and the football director.\nGaber was instrumental in Zamalek's triumphant campaign this season that saw the club win both the domestic league and Egypt Cup for the first time since 1988.\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:39:31.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
