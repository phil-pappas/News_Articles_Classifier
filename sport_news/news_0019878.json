We get too relaxed.\" \nThe Cardinals' defense has been working on becoming more consistent in practice this week, increasing the intensity to the point where defenders can only stop moving if they're granted a water break. \nJones thinks because of that intensity and past results, Saturday's game against the winless Demons could provide the perfect chance for the Cardinals' defense to stay on track for four quarters. \n\"I think we're right on the verge of having a complete game,\" Jones said. \"We've been showing it in practice all week. I think this could be our coming out party.\" \nMcGallion backed up Jones' confidence in the defense having a complete game, noting his approval for the practice intensity post-Abilene Christian. \n\"Tuesday's practice was our best Tuesday practice of the year defensively,\" McGallion said. \"We really practiced well.\" \nA complete defensive performance could prove to be the difference between a three-point win, like against the Bearkats, or a three-point loss and a spot in the FCS playoffs at the end of the season. \n\"We've been able to stand up to teams at the end (of the game),\" McGallion said. \"So we're trying to take that and what we've done at times in the first half and make it a whole game thing for our guys.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:28:48.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
