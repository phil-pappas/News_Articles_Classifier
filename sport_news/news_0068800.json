The top spot went to Stony Brook, which gobbled up seven of the first-place votes; the Great Danes got the other two. Coaches are not allowed to vote for their own team.\nThe Danes didn't practice Thursday, but the next time Brown is with his team, he'll talk about the poll.\n\"I will absolutely tell them about it,\" he said. \"We are the three-time defending champions in the league. I want to make it clear to them the coaches think there is a team in the league better than us. According to the experts, Stony Brook is the team to beat. You know us coaches; we are all crazy. We try to find different ways to get through to kids.\"\nMore Information\nAmerica East forecasts\n(First-place votes in parentheses; also total points)\nMen's poll\n1. Stony Brook (7) 63\n2.
