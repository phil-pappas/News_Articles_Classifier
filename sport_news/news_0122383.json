Syndergaard likely would start Game 5 on regular rest in a scenario without Matz.\n\"I’ve never done it before, but I’m willing. Anything to help us win,\" said deGrom, who threw four scoreless innings in Sunday’s 1-0 win. \"I think I’ll be ready on short rest.\"\nMatz could round out the rotation and start Game 4. He’ll have a long throwing session today, a bullpen session Tuesday, and if all goes well he’ll start an instructional league game Thursday in Port St. Lucie, Fla.\n\"Hopefully he’ll throw 90, 95 pitches, and it will all be determined by how he comes out [today] and Tuesday,\" Collins said. \"We’re prepared for him to be ready or for him not to be ready.\"\nURIBE QUESTIONABLE: Collins said it’s \"iffy\" that Juan Uribe will be on the NLDS roster. Uribe has been sidelined with a chest injury and has yet to do any physical activity. He originally suffered a chest contusion Sept. 20, then aggravated the injury Sept. 25 and hasn’t played since.\nROSTER MOVES: Anthony Recker, Bobby Parnell, Logan Verrett, Eric Young Jr. and Eric Campbell will not be on the postseason roster, but are heading to Port St. Lucie to work out in case they are summoned.\nBRIEFS: The team won 90 games for the 11th time in franchise history. It was 49-32 at home. ... DeGrom became the 11th pitcher in Mets history to record 200 strikeouts in a season. ... The .618 winning percentage against NL East foes was the best intra-division mark in baseball.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:43:46.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
