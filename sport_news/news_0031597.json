The surest sign that a change might be coming is head coach Jason Garrett saying the team would evaluate the quarterback position in the coming days.\nAdChoices Bob Strum of the Dallas Morning News , who knows the team as well as anyone, is fully convinced that Weeden should ride the pine :\nAbsolutely. There’s no question it’s time, if only because this season is dying on the vine. While it may not be Weeden’s fault entirely, the spark needed right now is not going to come from him. In fact you might make the case you would have an annoyed locker room if you didn’t do something during the bye week.\nIt all makes perfect sense and is impossible to argue against, except that there’s a two-word response that completely negates the call for a Weeden benching: Matt Cassel.\nCassel is Weeden’s backup, picked up off the scrap heap in Buffalo after Romo’s injury. You may remember that Cassel was a career backup at USC and stunned the football world when he was made a 7th-round pick in 2005 by the New England Patriots. He was thrust into duty in 2008 when Tom Brady went down with a season-ending injury in Week 1. He went 11-5 that year, was then traded to the Kansas City Chiefs, signed a deal worth $63 million with $28 million guaranteed and went 19-28 in his four years in KC, before settling into a role of journeyman. In the past four seasons he’s either been benched for or sat behind quarterbacks such as Brady Quinn, Christian Ponder, Tyrod Taylor and EJ Manuel.\nDallas has a bad option (Weeden) versus a worse option (Cassel). Sure, as Sturm says, bringing in some new blood provides a spark. But a spark lasts, what, one half, maybe a game if you’re lucky? Cassel would need to start four games if Romo hits his targeted Week 11 return date. Thus, the Cowboys don’t need a spark, they need a steadily burning fire.\nWeeden almost certainly isn’t that, but Cassel almost definitely isn’t that. The Cowboys come back from the bye on the road against the equally mediocre Giants. If Weeden can’t get the job done early in the game, then pull him, by all means. Bringing in Cassel out of nowhere might creat the spark of the unexpected. Announcing a Weeden benching this week, then giving the Giants time to game plan for Cassel negates whatever element of surprise might have existed.\nThat’s why Weeden should stay starter. Whenever a major change is made in sports, the first question is: Is Plan B better than Plan A? Brandon Weeden isn’t a great option but there’s no magical arm that’s going to come in and save the Dallas Cowboys from the absence of Tony Romo. The best way to weather the storm is to hope that the addition of Dez Bryant provides the aforementioned spark — remember, Weeden is 0-3 without the team’s best offensive player in his arsenal. It’s not as if it’s all his fault. (And losing to the Patriots, as Weeden did Sunday isn’t a crime either.)\nThen, the backup gets a win or two under his belt, while the NFC East stays a bastion of mediocrity. And come late November, everyone in Dallas looks to the heavens as a healthy Romo rides back into town and is given a hero’s welcome while leading Dallas all the way to the lofty heights of the divisional playoffs once again.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.dallasnews.com/sports/dallas-cowboys/20151011-sturm-after-horrible-game-time-to-bench-brandon-weeden-for-matt-cassel.ece", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/10/11/jason-garrett-will-evaluate-quarterback-position/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:43:00.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
