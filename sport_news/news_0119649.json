He was crawling through the middle one day and I was just thinking, 'what is this guy doing?'\" Hooper said. \n\"That was one of the first days of him working with us. I thought the scrum was going to collapse, but the boys managed to keep it up. He's an integral part of this team and has been since day dot. \n\"Being so hands on shows how committed he is, but so do the words that he brings to the team throughout the week, especially to the forward pack. \n\"He's an inspirational guy and completely motivated in seeing us do well and seeing us improve each week. \n\"Mario's been a great part of this team and he's got that other side where he can joke around and roll around in the middle of the scrum.\" \nHooper, Australia's vice-captain who will be making his 50th Test appearance on Sunday, insists Ledesma's influence extends beyond his technical expertise. \n\"All Argentinians are pretty emotional and he wants to see us do well. He's completely adopted our team and wants to see us improve,\" Hooper said. \n\"When he gives so much, you get emotionally attached to it. He's brought a lot of that passion that probably sometimes Australians don't have. \n\"Mario is tense every week, he is a front rower and he stresses about the scrum. \n\"He is not shy at all. He jokes around a hell of a lot. Then he can turn on serious when it comes to rugby time. He is a huge part of this team, especially forwards wise.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:13:04.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
