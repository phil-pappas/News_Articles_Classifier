When the high school football schedule came out this summer and the two teams were meeting for the second straight year, it was circled on the calendars of every player in the NFA locker room. Last year, Griswold pulled off one of the biggest upsets in recent league history. Fifty-one weeks later, the Wildcats finally got revenge, a common theme in a jubilant locker room following a 34-6 win. “This was redemption week for us,” NFA senior lineman Noah Brown said. “We’ve been talking a lot about redemption,” senior linebacker Peyton Whittaker said. New memories For quarterback Jawaun Johnson, who was stopped five yards shy of a game-winning touchdown on the last play of the game a season ago, that play will finally begin to dull in his mind. “It was payback from last year,” said Johnson, who ran for 172 yards on 16 carries. Johnson scored two touchdowns and threw for another as the Wildcats stayed unbeaten (3-0). “(Johnson) is an outstanding athlete,” Griswold coach Gregg Wilcox said. “He is a handful and they’re doing a lot of good things with him. We had him in the backfield a number of times and he just twists, turns, dips, whatever and we don’t get him. If we could have stopped (Johnson), it might have been a different ballgame.” That will be a refrain from most opposing coaches this year. While NFA had the best player on the field Friday night, they also had been waiting nearly a full calendar year to get another chance at Griswold. Brown, Whittaker and fellow captain Griffen Gooden all played youth football in Griswold, giving the Wildcats even more incentive. “Last year hit home for a lot of us,” Whittaker said. “We didn’t want to go out with a loss to those guys and have them have that over us for the rest of our lives.” Last year’s loss, coupled with the familiarity between the players, gave NFA coach Jemal Davis the ability to focus just on X’s and O’s. “I really didn’t need to talk a lot about (last year),” Davis said. “Our kids know the situation, know the history. It was really them that stressed what they needed to come out and do. From a coach, that’s what you want. You want kids to take ownership, take the reins and run with it. That’s what they did.” Page 2 of 2 - NFA surges ahead NFA got off to a slow start before finishing the second quarter with a flurry. After Griswold stopped NFA on a fourth-and-goal inside the 10-yard line late in the second quarter, Griswold was forced to punt. Instead of kicking the ball out of bounds, it went to Johnson, who returned it 40 yards for a score and a 13-0 lead. Griswold got the ball back and NFA’s Miles Joyner returned an interception 49 yards for a touchdown, making it 20-0 with a little more than a minute to play before halftime. It turned a one-possession game into a three-possession game in a matter of minutes. Brown ended the half with a sack of Griswold quarterback Cole Mileski, further pushing momentum into NFA’s corner. The Wolverines (2-2) entered Friday as one of just two ECC teams with a winning record against NFA since 2006 (New London is the other). “They came in well-prepared and they were ready to roll,” Wilcox said. “And they did.” Johnson added a 41-yard touchdown run on NFA’s first possession of the second half and threw a 13-yard touchdown pass to De’Jean General on a fourth-down pass late in the third quarter.
