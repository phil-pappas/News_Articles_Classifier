The locker room is being built, and I'm excited to see how that's going to look. It's more than football. If I take football out of the equation, I could see myself there for four years.\"\nThe 6-foot-1, 185-pound defensive back, out of Brentwood, California, chose the Beavers over offers from Arizona, Arizona State, Boise State, California, Colorado, Utah, Washington, Washington State and others.\nHe is rated the No. 9 safety in the country and the No. 136 player overall.\nThompson, who once called the Oregon Ducks his \"dream school,\" looked like a possible Oregon State lean after his official visit two weeks ago, deciding not to take any other trips and announcing that he was ready to make a decision this week.\n\"They are one of my top schools, one of my top,\" he told The Oregonian . \"It was getting to know the coaches and the team. I could definitely see myself playing up there. Like I've said before, my cousin, Xavier Crawford, is already up there, so it makes it that much better.\"\nThompson's commitment means Oregon State went two-for-two with four-star visitors during the week of the San Jose State game, as Christian Wallace, the nation's No. 6 athlete, also committed shortly after the trip .\nSurprisingly, Wallace was the second one to commit, as Thompson admitted he silently pledged to the Beavers during his trip.\n\"I silently committed while I was there,\" he said. \"I wanted to talk it over with my family and make sure it was the right decision to me, the right fit.\"\nOregon State has 11 known commitments in the class, including back-to-back four-star talents.\n-- Andrew Nemec\nanemec@oregonian.com\n@ AndrewNemec", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/BEAVERNATION?src=hash", "http://t.co/vgeQVMVh3T", "https://twitter.com/AndrewNemec", "https://twitter.com/7era_/status/651211855482892288", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/KA7CIGzAZ6E"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:25:41.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
