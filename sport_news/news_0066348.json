New Mexico KICKOFF: 4 p.m., Spartan Stadium. \nRADIO/TV: ROOT Sports/1590-AM and 860-AM. \nSERIES HISTORY: San Jose State leads the series 11-4-1. This is the first meeting between the schools since 2006 when the Spartans defeated the Lobos 20-12 in the inaugural New Mexico Bowl. \nSTORYLINES: The Spartans (3-4, 2-2, Mountain West) are looking to reset the compass after their worst showing of the season last week in a 30-7 defeat to San Diego State. ... New Mexico (4-3, 2-1) has started dual-threat sophomore Lamar Jordan at quarterback in the first seven games. But junior Austin Apodaca has come off the bench to complete 16 of 22 passes for 152 yards and a game-winning touchdown in the past two weeks. Lobos coach Bob Davie doesn't sound as if he is ready to abandon the running game for a passing attack. \"What Austin has done hasn't gone unnoticed by us,\" he said. \"I don't think it is all or nothing. He's not only one thing.\" \nINJURY UPDATE: San Jose State -- CB Jimmy Pruitt (concussion) and RB Thomas Tucker (ankle) are doubtful. New Mexico -- DE Kene Okonkwo (ankle) is out. DE Garrett Hughes (undisclosed) and DE Chris Lee (undisclosed) are doubtful. DL Sam Mabany (ankle) is questionable. \nMATCHUP TO WATCH: San Jose State's blockers against New Mexico's pass rush. The Spartans need to regain their offensive footing after scoring only seven points last week against San Diego State. It starts with better protection of quarterback Kenny Potter, who faces a New Mexico defense that has recorded 20 sacks in seven games but is thin at defensive end. Advertisement \nSTATS THAT MATTER: San Jose has a minus-seven turnover ratio, a big factor in its four defeats. The Spartans have thrown just one interception in their three victories ... Senior Tyler Ervin is 104 yards shy of becoming San Jose State's 11th player to gain 1,000 yards rushing in a single season. ... The Lobos have won three of their past four games. ... New Mexico's Carlos Wiggins had a 100-yard kickoff return against Hawaii last week for the fifth touchdown return of his career. ... CB Isaiah Brown and S Markel Byrd are back after missing last week's game because of suspensions for arriving late to their classes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:31:13.343+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
