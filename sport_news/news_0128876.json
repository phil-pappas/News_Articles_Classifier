Brennan Williams is putting away his cleats and lacing up some wrestling boots.\nAdChoices The offensive tackle was released from the New England Patriots practice squad Thursday morning and will pursue a career in pro wrestling. The Patriots didn’t feel Williams would be ready to play soon enough after sitting out with a bone bruise in his leg. The Patriots are offensive tackle-needy right now with starter Marcus Cannon out of practice while nursing a toe injury.\nThe 6-foot-6, 310-pound lineman was signed on Tuesday. The Patriots now have one open spot on their 10-man practice squad.\nWilliams told NESN.com he’s excited to start training with former WWE Superstar and current commentator Booker T at Reality of Wrestling in Houston next week. Williams had planned to begin working with Booker T this week before he got the call from the Patriots.\nWilliams, a huge WWE fan, told NESN.com after he was selected in the third round of the 2013 NFL Draft that he wanted to become a pro wrestler when his NFL career was finished. He was cut by the Texans before training camp in 2014 then signed with the Jacksonville Jaguars in February 2015. He was released with an injury settlement Aug. 29 and was out of football before being added to the Patriots’ practice squad.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://nesn.com/2015/10/patriots-sign-offensive-tackle-massachusetts-native-brennan-williams/", "http://nesn.com/2013/07/brennan-williams-wants-to-become-wwe-pro-wrestler-after-lengthy-healthy-nfl-career-is-over/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:25:21.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
