Puskar / Associated Press) Daniel Gallen Contact Reporter Former Maryland assistants James Franklin & Mike Locksley face off on opposite sidelines Saturday. \nWhen he joined Ron Vanderlinden’s Maryland staff as wide receivers coach in 2000, James Franklin was a 28-year-old working on the early part of a coaching career that would lead to a notable rise through the profession. \nDuring that early part of his career, Franklin turned to Maryland’s 31-year-old running backs coach Mike Locksley and forged a professional relationship that lasted through both of their careers. \nIn Saturday’s Maryland-Penn State game, the two former assistants will square off on opposite sidelines, with Franklin leading the Nittany Lions and Locksley leading the Terps for the first time as interim coach. \n“I’ve got a ton of respect for Mike,” Franklin said Tuesday. “Early in my career, going to the University of Maryland, Mike and really his family kind of took me in and kind of embraced me and kind of showed me the ropes in that area. I’ve got a lot of respect for Mike.” \nFranklin and Locksley both departed Maryland before returning some years later. Franklin left after the 2004 season to serve as the wide receivers coach for the Green Bay Packers for a season and as the quarterback coach and offensive coordinator at Kansas State for two seasons.

(Algerina Perna / Baltimore Sun) \nIn 2008, Franklin returned to join Ralph Friedgen’s staff, where he served as assistant head coach, offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach. He was viewed as the “coach-in-waiting” behind Friedgen and helped lead an offense in which quarterback Danny O’Brien won ACC Rookie of the Year in 2010. \nAfter a three-year stint at Vanderbilt, Franklin took over in State College, Pa., before the 2014 season. \n“James has always been a real enthusiastic guy,” Locksley said. “He's a guy that's been very passionate from the times that we've worked together. Obviously, from afar, I've seen him, how's matured and grown as a coach -and the success he's had as a head coach. I've got a lot of respect for the job that he's done.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:43:55.841+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
