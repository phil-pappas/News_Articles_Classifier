The man now faces additional charges Provided WARLICK Order Reprint of this Story YORK \nSheriff’s deputies released a courtroom video Thursday of an incident Tuesday where police say an inmate at a bond hearing allegedly threatened the lives of two York County prosecutors . \nLewis Albert Warlick, 30, of York, is charged with two counts of threatening the life of a public official, as well as domestic violence and probation violation. Warlick has been arrested three times in the past two weeks. \nProsecutors Daniel Porter and Ryan Newkirk from the 16th Circuit Solicitor’s Office were at the hearing to argue that bond should be denied for Warlick, prosecutors said. \nWarlick was not in handcuffs or shackles during the court hearing, the video shows. Video footage from the courtroom shows security officers wrestling a suspect to the ground after a violent outburst. \nThe video does not have audio. It appears Warlick points at the two prosecutors as he walks by them. Two bailiffs attempt to subdue Warlick when he became combative. Both officers and Warlick ended up on the ground, toppling chairs in the courtroom. Two more jail officers arrive to help detain Warlick, the video shows. Three more jailers then arrive. \nThe magistrate, Dan Malphris, is protected from defendants by a glass partition, but prosecutors are seated at a table near Warlick. Neither prosecutor was injured. \nMalphris sentenced Warlick to 30 days in jail for contempt of court. \nWarlick is being held without bond. He was arrested early Tuesday outside a Fort Mill bar and charged with domestic violence after a woman claimed he assaulted her, according to a police report. \nState Law Enforcement Division and court records show Warlick was released after an Oct. 1 arrest on a $5,000 bond. He was charged again with domestic violence on Oct. 8. . \nWarlick has previous convictions for assault, assault on a police officer and other crimes, records show.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:51:48.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
