It feels so good.” \nEven after Cole Brosnan ’snarrow miss and Jon Polos ’ rebound for Corona del Mar, the waters stayed choppy. Corona del Mar called its final timeout with four seconds left, but Newport Harbor’s Nic Rimlinger nearly pulled off a steal and goal, but his strike was waved off because time expired. \n“Great atmosphere,” Newport Harbor coach Ross Sinclair said. “If we get Sport Science (of ESPN) on this (shot by Brosnan), I think it’s going to be an eighth of an inch (off). We should hire them.” \nCorona del Mar (6-3) cracked the Newport Harbor (6-8) defense enough by passing into center early in possessions to beat the drop and feed its strength. Hack scored from center off an early-entry pass by Will Rodosky to give the Sea Kings a 7-5 lead with 4:07 left in the fourth. \nNewport Harbor dropped off Rodosky throughout, but he made the Sailors pay with four assists, including two on early-entries. \n“That’s one of the things we’ve been working on,” Hack said. “I still don’t think we’ve played our best game yet but we’ll get there.” \nSophomore Jason Grew , one of the Sailors’ emerging young players, trimmed the Sea Kings’ lead to 7-6 with a power-play strike with 3:46 left off a pass from Brosnan. But the Sailors finished 1 for 6 on the power-play against Matt Moran (nine saves). \n“Overall, we played great,” Sinclair said. “We got a lot of young kids I thought matured so fast over this week.” \nAt the Villa Park Classic: \nEl Toro 16, Damien of La Verne 13: The Chargers fell in the semifinals to top-seeded Sir Francis Drake of San Anselmo but rebounded to take third place. \nContact the writer: dalbano@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T12:17:13.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
