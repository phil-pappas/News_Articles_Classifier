Johnson has been a quality No. 2 to Taylor the last two seasons.\nJohnson said he watched video of former UB back Branden “Bo” Oliver and listened to running backs coach Matt Simon for motivation.\n“I went back and watched some of Bo’s runs to see what he did to be successful,” Johnson said. “The quickest thing to get yards and make something happen is just to go vertical.”\n“The past couple games I was doing too much in and out,” Johnson said. “I was indecisive with my runs. Coach Simon, everything he says, I take and listen to. He said to focus on running straight and not making any extra moves.”\nJohnson scored on runs of 4 and 39 yards. He now has 452 yards on the season. Taylor has 521.\nRecords: UB is 3-4. Ohio is 5-3.\nWhat it means: UB’s bowl hopes aren’t dead yet. The second half of UB’s schedule is easier than the first half. The Bulls would need to win four of the last five to have a good shot at a bowl.\nPlayers of the game: UB middle linebacker Nick Gilbo had a career-high 15 tackles. UB outside linebacker Brandon Berry had 13 tackles, hitting double figures for a fifth straight game.\nQB mismatch: UB quarterback Joe Licata thoroughly outplayed Ohio’s Derrius Vick. Licata hit 21 of 32 passes for 212 yards. Vick was 32 of 51 for 321 yards but threw four INTs. Licata beat the blitz on a 24-yard pass to Marcus McGill to set up UB’s first TD. He made sharp throws of 26 yards to Matt Weiser and 19 yards to McGill to set up UB’s third TD.\nShutdown corner: Boise Ross had two more pass breakups, giving him 16 for the season, which already ties the UB single-season record. That mark also is shared by Dave Short (1990) and Najja Johnson (2011).\nUnsung: UB’s offensive line handled Ohio’s quality defensive front four.\nSteady: Redshirt freshman Adam Mitcheson made field goals of 35 and 24 yards and saw one try blocked. Mitcheson is 9 of 12 on the season.\nNot so fast: Ohio had outscored foes, 56-6, in the first quarter and scored on its opening drive for the fifth time in eight games. But UB led, 14-7, after 15 minutes.\nLineups: Ohio started redshirt sophomore Chad Moore at middle linebacker in place of injured star Quentin Poling. Running back A.J. Ouellette played a little both ways for Ohio, filling in at middle linebacker. … Junior Roubbens Joseph saw some action for UB in relief of Dillon Guy at right guard.\nIn the house: Paid attendance was 17,128.\nNext up: UB has a short turnaround. The Bulls must travel to Miami University on Thursday for a game against the RedHawks.\nemail: mgaughan@buffnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:16:57.571+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
