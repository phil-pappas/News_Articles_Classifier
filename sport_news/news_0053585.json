So anyone who finds it will not be exposed to dangerous radiation.\nHowever, anyone who finds the container should not approach it and contact police.\nOfficials say the container was last known to be in a company vehicle.\nWe’re told this source holder is part of a larger tool used to assess geological formations in oil and gas, groundwater, mineral and geothermal exploration.\nThe steel container is silver in color, 12 inches high and 14 inches in diameter. It weighs about 75 lbs. The container is labeled on two sides as ‘DOT RADIOACTIVE YELLOW II’ with the radiation trefoil symbol, and the manufacturer’s name, ‘Hopewell Designs, Inc.,’ is on its base.\nThe inner source holder is about 4 inches long and 2 inches wide and is labeled as ‘DANGER RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL, DO NOT HANDLE, NOTIFY CIVIL AUTHORITIES.’\nCopyright 2015 WFIE .
