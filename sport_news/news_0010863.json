We just didn't capitalize. We had technique problems, stupid penalties, and we have to get off the field on third down, especially in that situation.\" \nInstead, Virginia (2-4, 1-1) made the plays it hasn't been making, including a sack of freshman quarterback Eric Dungey on third-and-10 from the 25 in the third overtime, forcing Cole Murphy to attempt what would have been a career-best 48-yard field goal. \nIt missed, and five plays later, Jordan Ellis' 3-yard touchdown run won it for the Cavaliers. \n\"I feel like we are not a 3-3 team,\" Franklin said, \"but that is our reality.\" \nEllis carried on three consecutive plays against an exhausted Orange defense, which was on the field for the last 6:52 of regulation. His runs covered 3 yards, minus-1 yard and then 3 yards again for the clinching score. \nThe second overtime went quickly, which favored Virginia after keeping the Orange defense on the field so long to end regulation. Virginia scored in three plays, with Taquan Mizzell scoring from the 13. Syracuse, starting at the 12 because of a Virginia penalty, needed just one play as Dungey found Steve Ishmael on the first play. \nSyracuse got the ball first in overtime and needed just five plays, with Dungey hitting Ervin Phillips with a 7-yard touchdown pass. A targeting foul against Zach Bradshaw on the play forced Virginia to start its drive at the 40, and on third down, Matt Johns rolled right and hit Canaan Severin for 36 yards and the tying touchdown. \nVirginia trailed most of the game, but got the ball with 6:52 left in regulation and used it all to tie it. The drive covered 88 yards in 19 plays, was highlighted by Johns' 11-yard pass to Mizzell on fourth-and-3 from near midfield and ended with Ian Frye's 25-yard field goal. \nTrailing 14-7 with the momentum on Virginia's side, the Orange turned to a trick play to get it back. It came out of a punt formation on a fourth-and-4 from the Syracuse 43 when punter Riley Dixon took two steps sideways as if to execute a rugby-style kick, then tucked the ball and ran for 15 yards. Five plays later, Jordan Fredericks scored from the one, pulling the Orange even at 14 with just 62 seconds left in the half. \nStarting at its 20, Johns hit Mizzell for 19 yards on the next play, threw two incompletions and then had an attempted screen pass tipped at the line and intercepted by Qaadir Sheppard, who returned it to the Cavaliers' 26 with 32 seconds left. \nOn the next play, Dungey dropped back, saw the middle of the field wide open and took off. He didn't meet a defender until inside the 5 and, after hurdling safety Quin Blanding, fell into the end zone for the touchdown. \nThe Orange drove 75 yards in 13 plays in the third quarter to set up Murphy's 22-yard field goal. \nVirginia scored two touchdowns in a span of four plays to go ahead 14-7. \nMizzell's 11-yard run capped a 75-yard drive, and three plays later, Dungey was hit as he prepared to throw. The ball traveled several yards in the air, and Wilfred Wahee scooped it up and returned it 22 yards. \nThe officials signaled a touchdown, and it stood when replays couldn't conclusively prove otherwise. \nMizzell also had a hand in Syracuse's first touchdown. After catching a screen pass, he was hit by Donnie Simmons and fumbled, the ball bouncing to Antwan Cordy, who sprinted 44 yards down the sideline for the touchdown. \nThe Orange lead could have been larger, but after driving to a first down at the Cavaliers' 2 in the opening quarter, a botched snap cost them 7 yards, and Virginia stuffed third- and fourth-down runs from the 1. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:12:21.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
