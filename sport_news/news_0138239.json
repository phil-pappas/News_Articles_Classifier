Toronto also rallied from a 2-0 deficit to beat Texas in the best-of-five AL Division Series and have won four straight this postseason while facing elimination. \"You look at all the elimination games, our offense has really come to life,\" Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said Thursday. \"We've said all along that's the key to our team, scoring runs. You hate to make a habit of it, but maybe we can pull it off again.\"\nIS PRICE RIGHT?\nToronto will send out ace David Price, who was outstanding down the stretch but has disappointed this postseason. Most recently, he pitched six shutout innings in Game 2 before surrendering five runs in the seventh. He has a 7.02 ERA in three appearances in these playoffs, with his lone win coming in a relief outing in Game 4 against Texas.\nREMATCH\nYordano Ventura faced David Price in Game 2 and wasn't much better than Toronto's touted ace, allowing three runs and eight hits over 5 1-3 innings before watching Kansas City's comeback win from the bench. \"I'm very fortunate and happy that this game has landed on my turn, here in Kansas City, and with the opportunity to take this club to the World Series,\" Ventura said through catching coach Pedro Grifol, acting as an interpreter. \"I'll be ready for this game.\"\nYES FOR YOENIS?\nThe Mets will host a workout at Citi Field to try to stay fresh while waiting for Game 1 of the World Series, which will be Tuesday at either Toronto or Kansas City. The focus will be at least partially on outfielder Yoenis Cespedes, who exited New York's Game 4 win with left shoulder soreness. \"Cespedes' shoulder is going to be OK,\" manager Terry Collins said after Game 4. \"They didn't think there was any damage.\"\nSKIPPER SEARCH\nThe Dodgers are out of the playoffs and now without a manager after parting ways with Don Mattingly on Thursday, meaning general manager Farhan Zaidi and his crew are now looking for a new skipper for 2016. Mattingly and Zaidi said the breakup was mutually decided after a series of postseason meetings revealed it was \"evident that this was the best thing for both parties,\" according to Mattingly. Los Angeles, Miami, San Diego, Seattle and Washington all now have managerial openings, and Mattingly says he still wants to manage.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
