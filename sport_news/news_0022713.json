His average of 6.1 yards per carry dwarfs Murray's 3.5 average. Even if you remove Mathews' 63-yard touchdown run on Sunday Night Football against the Panthers from the equation, Mathews would still have a sizable advantage and 5.1 yards a pop.\nIf you then consider that 24 of Mathews' 56 carries came in the game Murray missed with an injury, it begins to seem a bit stange that Philadelphia is not getting him more involved. He's just flat out-playing Murray and seems to have earned a larger share of the role.\nAsked after Sunday's loss to the Panthers why Mathews hasn't gotten more touches, Kelly deferred to running backs coach (and former Eagles running back) Duce Staley. \"Duce is running the rotation,\" Kelly said, via the Philadelphia Inquirer . \"Some of it is we're calling pass plays. (Mathews) was in there for a few passes.\"\nPer Pro Football Focus, Mathews has been on the field for 132 offensive snaps so far this season, 75 of which have been runs -- a rate of 56.8 percent. Murray, meanwhile, has been out there for 232 snaps, 140 of which have been pass plays -- 60.3 percent. That's a pretty close split, but if you remove the one game where Mathews filled in for Murray, then 65.2 percent of the plays for which he's been on the field this season have been passes.\nMaybe it's a chicken and egg situation here, where the Eagles already have a pass play called and then Staley sends Mathews into the game, but it seems like they should be able to rectify this and start calling a few more runs when he's out there. Either that, or just start giving him a larger share of the snaps altogether. He's earned it with his play. Ryan Mathews has earned more runs.
