The robbers looted four mobile phones and cash of players by breaking the lock of a dormitory from the stadium premises.\nThe players are here to participate in the All India SAI Inter-regional Hockey Tournament for men and women. Frequent incidents of robbery in the stadium has raised concern over safety and security of players.\n\"The frequent incidents of theft from the stadium is really worrying. It is not only affecting the players but also creating a bad name for Kalinga Stadium as well as Odisha among the sporting community. At least CCTV surveillance should be there in the stadium,\" said Manoj Bhadra, a spokesperson of Sports Authority of India (Odisha).\nThe hockey players of Jharkhand, who are part of Eastern region team have been staying in a dormitory in the stadium. When they were in the field during the noon someone entered into the room by breaking its lock. \"It is really unfortunate and disturbing. Such things should not happen in a sporting complex. Away from home one feels helpless if his or her valuable are stolen,\" said a player.\nHowever, Kalinga Stadium officials blamed it on shortage of security staff to keep a watch on the stadium spread over 60 acres of area. Officer in-charge of Kalinga Stadium B R Mohanty said, \"There are only 11 security guards in each shift. The stadium has nine gates, basketball court, swimming complex, hockey stadium, tennis court apart from offices, dormitories and hostels in its premises. The players should take care of their belongings.\"\nLast week miscreants robbed valuables of rugby players of under-19 Kerala team from a dormitory in the stadium. A police complaint has been lodged in the Nayapalli police station in this regard.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-09-30T05:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:39:44.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
