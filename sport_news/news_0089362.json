Monica D'Ippolito Contact Reporter Howard County Times Centennial, led by Jasmine McCree's early goal, edges Reservoir 1-0 Thursday \nOne mistake was the difference in the game between Centennial and Reservoir Thursday night, with the Eagles coming out as the beneficiaries. \n“I think overall we did pretty well. Obviously I feel pretty confident in saying we’re not going to give up another goal like that, where basically we gift them a goal,” said Gators coach Phil Ranker after the 1-0 loss. “As coaches, we always hope (that when) you lose before the playoffs that it motivates you and pushes you. For us, I guess we’re lucky, we don’t have to wait and we get another crack at them in a week and a half, so we’ve shown we can beat anybody and we can beat anybody in the county. It’s just a matter if we put it all together or not. I think we’ll be alright, just have to stay focused and eliminate silly mistakes.\" \nIt was a first round preview of next week’s playoff matchup between the two schools, as they will face off again Tuesday, Nov. 3. Centennial coach Steve Baxter didn’t think the outcome will have any effect on the playoff game, other than the fact that he knows his team can hang around with the top teams in the county. \n“They’re obviously a really good team,” he said. “I think their strength is their midfield, and I just think it will be a really good playoff game. I think it will come down to who will make a mistake, like tonight.” \nThe Eagles (6-5 county, 8-5-1) netted a goal early in the first half, as junior midfielder Jasmine McCree pressed Gators keeper Janie Romer on a back-pass. Her clear deflected toward the net, and she won the race after the loose ball and knocked it into the open goal.

We needed this win.” \nAfter Reservoir (7-3-1, 7-3-4) went down 1-0, it picked up its play and controlled the following 22-minutes of action until the break. The Gators wound up out-shooting the Eagles 9-3 in the half, but could not capitalize with an equalizer and dropped only their third game in the last 10 contests. \nIf anything, Ranker said he learned the importance of scoring first, knowing Centennial is good at holding a one-goal advantage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:08:21.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
