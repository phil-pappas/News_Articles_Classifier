(Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images) Ravens receiver Steve Smith Sr. insists that he hasn't wavered on his previously announced plans to call it a career at the end of this season.\nSpeculation emerged last week that Smith may be having second thoughts when he said that he was just taking everything one day at a time when asked if might return for a third season with Baltimore.\nAdChoices \"I'm on schedule for what I discussed earlier in the year,\" Smith said via Jamison Hensley of ESPN.com. \"People keep saying that I avoided the question. It's not about avoiding. This is a week-to-week game. Every game presents its own issues.\"\nThe Ravens would certainly love to see Smith finish his three-year contract in Baltimore. He has by far been the team's most dangerous weapon with 36 receptions for 510 yards and three touchdowns. He caught seven balls for 137 yards and a score against San Francisco on Sunday with four micro fractures still in his back. Has anyone tried to persuade a return?\n\"Man, we're 1-5,\" Smith said. \"You think we're talking about persuading. We're trying to fix all of the damn holes in this boat right now.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/baltimore-ravens-steve-smith-reconsidering-retirement-end-of-season-101915", "http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:09:31.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
