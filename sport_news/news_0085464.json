But it also makes perfect sense. \nA big reason why the Jaguars have increased their opening five-game scoring average from a dreadful 13.6 to a still-must-be-better 18.8 is their work at the end of the first half. The game has slowed down for Bortles in general and in the must-do-things-quickly situations in particular. \nFour times in five games, Bortles has led a first half-ending scoring drive, touchdowns against Carolina and Tampa Bay, field goals against Miami and Indianapolis. No time? No problem. \n“The guys like it,” Bortles said. “They feel comfortable doing it, and I think that’s why it pays off for us.” \nDuring those possessions, Bortles is 14-of-19 passing for 186 yards, two touchdowns and a sparkling 126.7 passer rating. He also has scrambles of 12 and 21 yards. \n“Unbelievable when you look at it,” Hackett said. “You would think the two-minute is the [part of the offense] that comes last in the whole process. But the way he commands it, the way he owns it, the way he leads them down the field, the way he doesn’t get flustered when something happens — he’s been consistent throughout the whole year.” \nSaid Houston coach Bill O’Brien: “[Bortles] is a poised guy and he understands offensively what they want to do in those situations. And he can run.” \nBortles’ effectiveness during the end-of-first-half situations — the early-drive completions, the scrambles, the touchdown throws — makes the next question easy: When will the Jaguars sprinkle in the no-huddle during a regular part of the game? \nToday against Houston could be the perfect time. The best — and maybe only? — way to neutralize Texans defensive end/one-man wrecking crew J.J. Watt. \n“There are always thoughts of that,” Jaguars offensive coordinator Greg Olson said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:19:56.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
