Riders will gather in Clark Park in southwest Detroit before heading over the bridge to Windsor, Ontario. \nAfter crossing the bridge over the Detroit River they’ll return to the U.S. and then embark on a 20-mile ride through Detroit. They’ll wrap up with lunch at Clark Park. \nThe ride is hosted by Tour de Troit. Advance registration was required for the ride due to restrictions about crossing the border. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T11:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:44:13.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
