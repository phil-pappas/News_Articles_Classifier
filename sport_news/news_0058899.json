Mourinho had claimed that \"referees are afraid to give decisions for Chelsea\". \nThe Chelsea boss was furious with the fine, while pointing out the lack of punishment Wenger had received earlier in the season. \n\"£50,000 is a disgrace. The possibility of getting a stadium ban is astonishing,\" he said at the launch of his book earlier in October. \n\"The word 'afraid' is a punishment, and a hard punishment. But to say the referee was 'weak and naive', referring to one of the top referees, not just in this country, also in Europe, to call him 'weak and naive' we can do.\" \nChelsea travel to West Ham on Saturday, having returned to their winning ways in the Premier League with a 2-0 victory over Aston Villa.
