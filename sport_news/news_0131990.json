Most recently, Cherry Creek waxed Overland 38-9. Senior QB Joe Caplis tossed three TD passes and the Bruins picked off former Teammate Ray Rountree five times, twice by Jacob Hallam. David Imola, Trevor Philio and Jonathan Van Diest each had 1.5 sacks. Both teams are 2-0 in league.\nAdvertisement A year ago, Grandview beat Cherry Creek 24-6. It's the Bruins last loss. The past two weeks, the Wolves' Hayden Blubaugh has rushed for 619 yards and seven TDs. QB Gunnar Lamphere was just 2-of-5 with an interception last week in a 42-7 pasting of Cherokee Trail, but both completions went for TDs. Coach John Schultz said running play-action will be vital against the top-tier teams. The Wolves have won eight consecutive Centennial games.\nValor Christian (4-2) vs. Cherokee Trail (3-3) Thursday, 7 p.m. at Legacy Stadium\n5A Centennial League\nThe visiting Eagles have won three games in a row and are 2-0 in league. They also were 2-1 against out-of-state teams. Five different Valor players have attempted a pass, but the main guy remains junior Dylan McCaffrey, who now has 11 TD passes against three interceptions, and recently landed an offer from LSU. McCaffrey also leads the Eagles in rushing, a concern for coach Rod Sherman. Of Ben Waters' 16 receptions, five have gone for TDs. Gabriel Kortz heads Valor by being in on 52 tackles and Noah Elliss is tops on the team with 5.5 sacks.\nEven and .500? Cherokee Trail is 3-3 and has scored 105 points and surrendered 106. The Cougars have gone down in their last seven Centennial games.\nLegacy (4-2) vs. Fossil Ridge (4-2) Thursday, 7 p.m. at French Field\n5A Front Range League\nLegacy QB Matt Lynch ran for two TDs and passed for two more last week in a 34-15 decision of Poudre. He also threw for 252 yards. Derek Coleman grabbed six receptions for 92 yards and Dalton Royer had five for 66 yards. LB Evan Baugh had the big game on defense for the Lightning. He recorded an interception and was in on 10 tackles.\nAt 3-1 in the league and a game behind Front Range leader Horizon, Legacy next will host Monarch, then complete the regular season by hosting Fairview. The matchup is another sign of the Front Range's balance -- both teams are 4-2, 3-1. The SaberCats have allowed only 66 points, which ties them with Cherry Creek for third-lowest in 5A, behind Columbine (41) and Horizon (58).\nDoherty (4-2) vs. Fountain-Fort Carson (4-2) Friday, 7 p.m. at Guy Barickman Stadium\n5A Continental South\nDoherty is fresh from a 27-18 setback to Legend despite RB Quan Baker's 167 yards rushing and a TD. It gave him 1,075 yards for the season, along with 11 TDs. He also had a 34-yard completion against the Titans. Doherty has thrown only one TD pass all season. It went to Dillon Kelly, a 76-yarder on Sept. 19 against Highlands Ranch.\nFountain-Fort Carson has won four straight games since beginning with losses to Columbine and Lakewood. Erik Donnell heads the Trojans with 565 yards rushing and four TDs. QB Stock Chenault has thrown for six TDs and rushed for three. The Trojans are 2-0 in league and own a one-game lead over the Spartans, Castle View, Chaparral and Legend.\nPomona (4-2) vs. Columbine (6-0) Friday, 7:30 p.m. at Jefferson County Stadium\n5A Jeffco\nReally, it's Pomona vs. Columbine and every schoolboy follower appreciates the matchup. The Panthers (3-1 in league) opened their season against Valor Christian, Cherry Creek and Mullen, as good as any other schedule. Sophomore Bryan Marquez has thrown for 716 yards and has four TD passes against zero interceptions.\nColumbine (4-0 in league) has given up a measly 41 points, the best in 5A. Ask around -- what's the most noticeable improvement about Columbine's offense? Two words: backfield speed. And throw in some balance. RB Mikey Griebel has 555 yards rushing. Next are: QB Jake Lowry (470) and RBs Matthew Starkey (324) and Tim Mullin (309). Griebel also is averaging 26 yards per reception.\nPalmer Ridge (5-1) vs. Durango (6-0) Friday, 6 p.m. at Demon Feld\n4A Pikes Peak\nTake the road trip from Denver. It's a spectacular drive this time of year. Palmer Ridge's one hit was to Vista Ridge by 40-28 on Sept. 25. Senior QB Isaiah Sanders has been convincing -- he has thrown for 1,672 yards, 18 TDs and just two picks. His main target has been Trevor Grob, who has 26 receptions for 516 yards and seven TDs. Bailey Rosenstrauch has managed four interceptions. Both teams are 1-0 in league.\nA week after outlasting Montrose by 36-35 in the one of the top games of the regular season, Durango pasted Liberty by 49-17. Demons senior QB Terrence Trujillo has thrown for 16 TD passes and, like Sanders, has at least one in every game. Lukas Baken is off to a solid start with 28 catches for 477 yards and nine TDs. The 4A resident truth awaits Durango -- two-time defending state champion Pine Creek is next.\nWindsor (6-0) vs. Longmont (6-0) Thursday, 6:30 p.m. at Everly-Montgomery Field\n4A Longs Peak\nWindsor's strong start came with one in which the Wizards had to work -- they beat Greeley West 21-7 last week. The Wizards have already rushed for 2,191 yards. Tops on the team is Brad Peeples, who has 719 yards and is tied with Landon Schmidt for a team-leading eight TDs. On defense, Schmidt has recorded three interceptions.\nLongmont has been in tune since falling to Pine Creek in last season's finale at Sports Authority Field at Mile High. The Trojans lead 4A in scoring (267 points). Senior RB Conlan Berger heads Longmont with 776 yards rushing and 13 TDs. QB David Speidel has thrown for nine TDs and run for another six.\nCentaurus (5-1) vs. D'Evelyn (4-2) Friday, 7:30 p.m. at Trailblazer Stadium\n3A Metro North\nFormer Boulder coach Bob Carskie is ecstatic about his Warriors' showing to date. Centaurus' one hit came against Erie, by 37-20 on Sept. 11 . Matthew Axelrod has 18 carries, but five TDs. Centaurus was 3-7 a year ago, 7-22 over the past three.\nD'Evelyn QB Owen Burke has been piling up the numbers. He's 153-of-208 for 2,384 yards an a whopping 24 TDs. Charlie Davis has totaled 66 catches for 1,025 yards and eight TDs. Justin Kehoe has another 30 receptions and scored 10 times. Twelve different Jaguars have caught a pass.\nFaith Christian vs. Kent Denver (6-0) Friday, 3 p.m. at Justin DeSorrento Memorial Field\n2A Colorado\nFaith Christian (3-1 in league) has won its past three games by an aggregate 142-13. Trevor Elson has handled most of the Eagles rushing, having compiled 983 yards for 13 TDs. And Joseph Siravo has added five TDs, with a 23.1 average on 12 carries. The two programs are longtime rivals, but the real news here involves Kent Denver coach Scott Yates. He's one victory from 300. Only Pat Panek (306), Ken Soper (305) and Chris Brown (303 and active) are in front of him.\nLast week, Kent Denver moved to 4-0 in league by handling Denver North 40-11. Yates sat out his top two RBs, Will McKissick and Luke Wilson, who were injured. He anticipates that both will play against Faith. The Sun Devils, state runners-up a year ago, have registered three shutouts.\nFort Morgan (6-0) vs. Vista PEAK (4-2) Saturday, noon at Aurora Public Schools Stadium\n3A Colorado 7\nIt's a chance to view the Mustangs while in the metropolitan area. They have been convincing -- they are tied for second (with Holy Family) in scoring and are first in defense (34). CSU-bound Toby McBride, the 6-foot-3, 247-pound fullback/defensive end, has rushed for seven TDs and leads Fort Morgan by being in on 36 tackles, and recorded two sacks. Tate Kembel is tops on the Mustangs with 734 yards rushing and 13 TDs.\nFort Morgan was a semifinalist a year ago, finishing 10-3. The matchup is for the Colorado 7 lead. Both teams are 3-0. The Bison have won three straight games. Vista QB Derrick Smashum -- an awesome football name -- has thrown for 1,280 yards and 13 TDs, although he has been picked off eight times. The Bison's top receiver is Dylan Holt, who has 32 catches for 450 yards and seven TDs.\nAurora Central (6-0) vs. George Washington Saturday, 4 p.m. at All-City Stadium\n4A Mountain\nSeven different Trojans have rushed for at least 101 yards. Aurora Central is in its fourth consecutive road game, and next week, at Wheat Ridge, will be a fifth. RB Taevon Jordan and QB Jalil Grimes lead the Trojans with six rushing TDs. The six opponents of the Trojans have a combined 12-25 record.\nGW got spanked last week by Wheat Ridge 46-8. The Patriots' six foes, by the way, have an aggregate 10-26 mark. Aurora Central is 1-0 in league; the Pats are 0-1.\nCompiled by Neil H.
