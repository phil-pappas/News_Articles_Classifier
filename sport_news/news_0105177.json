(AP) — Chad Kelly threw for 241 yards and two touchdowns and No. 24 Mississippi used a dominant defense to beat No. 15 Texas A&M 23-3 on Saturday night.\nOle Miss (6-2, 3-1 Southeastern Conference) bounced back from last week's loss to Memphis. Laquon Treadwell caught five passes for 102 yards and a touchdown and Jaylen Walton ran for 97 yards.\nTexas A&M (5-2, 2-2) has lost two straight. Sophomore Kyle Allen completed just 12 of 34 passes for 88 yards before being replaced by Jake Hubenak early in the fourth quarter.\nOle Miss jumped out to a 16-3 lead by halftime and put the game out of reach with a 58-yard touchdown pass from Kelly to Treadwell with 9:16 left in the third quarter.\nTexas A&M running back Tra Carson (5) runs upfield against Mississippi defenders during the first half of an NCAA college football game in Oxford, Miss., Saturday, Oct. 24, 2015.

Solis/AP) Ole Miss then relied on its defense to coast to a surprisingly one-sided win.\nThe victory was vital for Ole Miss as it continues to control its own fate in the Western Division thanks to a win over Alabama in September. The Rebels are still a game behind first-place LSU, but host the Tigers on Nov. 21 in Oxford.\nOle Miss wasn't at its best offensively — Kelly threw three interceptions — but still pushed out to a 13-0 lead midway through the second quarter following a 7-yard touchdown pass from Kelly to Evan Engram and two field goals.\nThe final few minutes of the second half were eventful with three turnovers on three consecutive plays — two by Texas A&M and one by Ole Miss. The Rebels were able to convert the Aggies' second miscue into a field goal for a 16-3 halftime lead.", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site333/2015/1024/20151024__FBCT25TexasA&ampMMississippi~p2_200.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:36:22.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
