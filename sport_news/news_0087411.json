Normally a hamstring injury takes anything between two to six weeks depending on the extent of the injury. \n\nIshant, in any case, will be missing the first Test due to ICC ban but if hamstring injury turns out to be serious then it might lead him to miss the second Test in Bengaluru as well. \n\nThe Indian team for the final two Test matches will be selected on Monday, October 19. \n\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T19:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:34:28.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
