Fox said Thursday that it will air an hour-long program recapping the frame full of bizarre plays from Game 5 of the AL Division Series. “The Unforgettable Inning” will be hosted by former pitcher CJ Nitkowski and broadcast at 3 p.m. today on Fox Sports 1. The 53-minute seventh Wednesday in Toronto started with the teams tied 2-2. In the top of the inning, Texas’ Rougned Odor scored the go-ahead run with two outs when Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin’s throw back to the mound hit batter Shin-Soo Choo, and the ball rolled up the third-base line. Fans pelted the field with debris during an 18-minute delay. In the bottom of the inning, the Rangers committed three straight errors to help Toronto tie the score, and Jose Bautista hit a three-run homer, complete with an emphatic bat flip, for a 6-3 lead. Benches cleared twice during the half-inning. Toronto advanced to face the Royals in the ALCS, which starts Friday night on Fox.
