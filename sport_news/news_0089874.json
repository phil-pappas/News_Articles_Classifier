Oklahoma takes out its frustrations\nHead coach Bob Stoops drew some criticism from the media and fans for his \"I don't play\" comments during his weekly media session following the upset loss to the Texas Longhorns. While that may have been taken out of context, Stoops was referring to getting his team motivated to play. There was no issue doing so in today's game against the Wildcats.\nThe team had 17 first downs in the first half and 324 total yards while racking up 35 points on the Wildcats.\nThe defense also played so well (forcing two interceptions) that Bill Snyder pulled starting quarterback Joe Hubener for wide receiver Kody Cook.\nOklahoma also played its most complete half of any game this season. Four of its five scoring drives were in 1:30 or less and quarterback Baker Mayfielf was in command of the offense.\n2. Protection problems still exist\nThe same problems that plagued the Oklahoma offense against Texas still exist. There were several times where Mayfield had little to no time because of blown assignments by the offensive line. Mayfield's scrambling ability helped avoid some sacks, but the Kansas State defense was able to pressure the Sooners quarterback.\nAfter the loss to the Longhorns, senior center Ty Darlington said he and the offensive line were frustrated because the entire unit couldn't get in sync with one another on drives. Darlington said that four of the five linemen would do what they were supposed to, but one would make a mistake and it'd cost the team . That didn't happen as much this week, but the problems still exist.\n3. How Sooners remedied those protection problems\nStoops and offensive coordinator Lincoln Riley had an excellent plan to remedy the protection problems. Instead of running deep routes, the Oklahoma offense got the ball out of Mayfield's hands quickly by throwing screen passes. The ability to block by the receiving and tight end units enabled Oklahoma to just dominate offensively.\n4. Kansas State couldn't do what it does best\nThe Wildcats are a run-first team. They weren't able to do much running after falling behind early. That forced Hubener to throw and the Wildcats didn't do well at all. Hubener went 4-12 with two interceptions before being replaced by Cook, a wide receiver. Overall, the Wildcats finished with 65 rushing yards for the whole game, which is the lowest for any game this season by 79 yards (lowest is 144 against Oklahoma State).\n5. The running backs got involved\nNot only did Joe Mixon and Samaje Perine have 129 rushing yards on 26 attempts, the team also got them involved in the passing game.\nThe two backs combined for five catches and 49 receiving yards on screen plays. Mayfield would option the backs to either side of the offense and he'd sling them the ball while they were moving towards the sidelines.\nThat's another positive adjustment Riley and Stoops have made regarding the offense. With the offensive line struggling at times it's hard for the Sooners to run the ball effectively. Getting Mixon and Perine the ball on a screen pass to the flat could be more effective than running the ball since the Sooners' wide receivers are so good at blocking.\nTwitter: @Josh_Friemel\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "http://dallasnews.stats.com/cfb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=201510170021&home=21&vis=24"], "published": "2015-10-18T02:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:46:46.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
