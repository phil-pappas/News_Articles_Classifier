Grier and the Gators travel to Missouri this week for a difficult road test against the Tigers. \nViral Vines and viral quarterbacks converge for this surprisingly contagious stack of Monday morning SEC hot cakes ... hot takes not available until the lunch menu rolls over at 10:30 a.m... \nA long week of traveling around the country chasing his three famous children extended into Sunday evening with Chad Grier navigating around the flooded byways of South Carolina. \nGrier's trek took him to Los Angeles last Monday where one of his sons ( Nash Grier ) was preparing for a fashion show in Paris , and another son ( Hayes Grier ) was competing in Dancing With The Stars . On Saturday night, the eldest of the Grier boys — and easily least famous of the bunch — had a breakout game at the quarterback position for the University of Florida. \nWill Grier, the redshirt freshman passer for the Gators, took his turn in the national family spotlight with an inspired performance against previously unbeaten Ole Miss. Grier passed for four touchdowns in the first half, which was more than enough offense in the 38-10 victory. That Grier picked apart Ole Miss' previously hawkish defense (seven interceptions/three for touchdowns) while dealing with the flu bug only enriched an already unbelievable story for the Grier family . \nA high school coach for Davidson Day School in Davidson, N.C., Chad Grier's team was off last week, and the scheduled bye gave him a chance to crisscross the map. In between trips to Southern California and North Central Florida, he actually traveled back to the North Carolina on Friday to scout an opponent. \nThen he drove to Gainesville, Fla., \"through a monsoon.\" \nFather Grier's eventful odyssey from the family home in Stanley, N.C., to Hollywood, Calif., to Ben Hill Griffin Stadium didn't end with a post-game party in Gainesville, though. He still had to get home, and with some nasty weather bearing down on the Carolinas over weekend, things got downright scary . \nEight long hours on the road on Sunday gave Grier plenty of time to reflect on the previous seven days. He still can't wrap his brain around it all. \n\"It's surreal what has happened with my kids,\" Grier said. \"I can't explain it. I can't tell you how it happened.\" \nThe two younger Grier boys initially found celebrity through the social media app Vine, but since then have pursued more traditional avenues to fame. If you don't know who Nash and Hayes Grier are yet, then don't worry. Your teenage daughters certainly do. \nChad Grier still doesn't fully comprehend how his youngest sons have become nationally — and internationally — famous, but he can somewhat relate to the journey of his oldest boy. Like Will at Florida, father Chad was a quarterback in college. He played for East Carolina, though, and that experience never really presented a stage quite like The Swamp during a game of national relevance. \n\"It was so loud,\" Grier said. \nAnd all that noise brought out the best in his son. \nA side note in the SEC East before trouncing Ole Miss (4-1, 2-1), the Gators (5-0, 3-0) now stand alone atop the division's standings as the only undefeated team. Grier had plenty of help filling the box score with 271 yards passing, including some amazing catches by Demarcus Robinson, but the second-year freshman quarterback had the look of a star in the making. \n\"The way he was just moving and talking to his guys along the sidelines,\" Grier said, \"I could tell the game was slowing down for him, and he was figuring things out.\" \nGrier coached his son in high school , so he has unique insight into Will's progression over the years. Of course, it was obvious to anyone with eyes that Florida's quarterback made a quantum leap in that first half against the Rebels. Ole Miss quarterback Chad Kelly had all the swagger after beating Alabama, but it was Grier who showed the true poise under pressure (albeit at home). \nThat's a rare skill for a freshman, but especially noteworthy when defensive lineman Robert Nkemdiche is crouched across the line of scrimmage. \nQuarterbacks in the SEC will never admit to being a little intimidated by Nkemdiche's presence on the field, but those players' parents readily acknowledge their concerns. \nChad Grier usually isn't the worrisome type when he watches his son play football, but when Nkemdiche is on the field parents instinctively worry about their children. \n\"He's a monster,\" Grier said. \nA father's proudest moment on Saturday? \n\"Will was really making the effort to stay back there and distribute the ball,\" Grier said. \"There was one play where Nkemdiche had a clean shot at him, and the fact that he was going to take a hit, and he still put his back foot in the ground, and planted his foot before throwing and taking that hit was pretty cool.\" \nUp next for the Gators' latest quarterbacking sensation? Grier gets a difficult road test this week at Missouri, which features the league's best passing defense (154.2 yards per game). \nFOURNETTE FEAST \nCalls for LSU's Leonard Fournette to preserve his body for the NFL likely won't be going away despite talk of an insurance policy for the team's star running back . \nThere's a groundswell of voices ( some being NBA players who turned pro after one season ) to allow Fournette to skip his junior season and go straight to the pros. That option is not likely to happen, but Fournette could theoretically sit out his junior season. The concern, of course, is that Fournette might injure himself before being allowed to turn pro by the NFL. \nFournette remained the nation's frontrunner for the Heisman Trophy Award over the weekend after becoming the first player in SEC history to rush for more than 200 yards in three consecutive games. Fournette had 233 yards and three touchdowns on 26 carries in LSU's 44-22 victory against Eastern Michigan. \nThe New Orleans native has rushed for more yards (864 on 99 carries) through the first four games of the season than any running back since the turn of the century. Northern Illinois' Garrett Wolfe rushed for 828 yards on 96 carries through the first four games of the 2006 season. \nConsidering how the NBA's one-and-done rule has ruined college basketball, proponents of college football remaining the de facto minor leagues for the NFL would go to the mattresses over the league's current age requirements (three years out of high school). Barring a lawsuit (or a rival pro league), school presidents likely need not worry about protecting their cash cow from the free market. \nIN CASE YOU WERE WONDERING \nThe national record for consecutive games of at least 200 yards rushing is five held by Marcus Allen of Southern California (1981), Barry Sanders of Oklahoma State (1988) and Jamario Thomas of North Texas (2004). For Fournette to join that hallowed list, he would have to rush for 200 or more yards next week against South Carolina (doable) and then Florida (going to be tough). The Gamecocks are allowing 170 yards per game. Florida, with a rushing defense ranked No.2 in the SEC, currently is giving up an average of 97.80 rushing yards per game. \nMELTDOWN IN MISSOURI \nPeople keep telling me that South Carolina coach Steve Spurrier would never retire after such a poor season, but what more does the guy have left to prove? At 70 years old, this very well could be Spurrier's final season if his team keeps losing games the way it did in Missouri. \nSouth Carolina became the SEC's first team to 0-3 in conference play with a 24-10 loss at Memorial Stadium. The Gamecocks failed to score in the second half with starting quarterback Lorenzo Nunez completing just five passes to three interceptions. \nSouth Carolina passed for 40 yards in the second half. \nTEXAS TOAST \nRanking the Top 5 SEC coaches most likely to replace Texas coach Charlie Strong... \n5. Les Miles, LSU head coach — Throw in Fournette and we got a deal. \n4. Jim McElwain, Florida head coach — If you can't get Saban, take his brightest pupil. \n3. Dan Mullen, Mississippi State head coach — Innovative thinker who knows how to get the most out of his players. \n2. Nick Saban, Alabama head coach — Show him an offer he can't refuse. \n1. Hugh Freeze, Ole Miss head coach — A brilliant mind ready for a big-time job. \nOPENING ACTION \nNew Mexico State at Ole Miss, Ole Miss by 8 \nLSU at South Carolina, LSU by 11 ½ \nGeorgia at Tennessee, Georgia by 2 \nTroy at Mississippi State, Mississippi State by 31 ½ \nArkansas at Alabama, Alabama by 16 \nFlorida at Missouri, Florida by 3 ½ Joseph Goodman is a senior reporter and columnist for AL.com.
