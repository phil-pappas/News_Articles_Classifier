I try to enjoy myself on the field. Sometimes you have good times when you can try everything and it comes off.” \nAubameyang opened his account after 18 minutes by finishing off a superb move started by right-back Matthias Ginter on the flank, as a series of quick passes saw Ilkay Gundogan provide the striker with a simple tap in. \nMarco Reus doubled the lead on 21 minutes when he fired home a superbly worked cross from Kagawa and the fleet-footed winger claimed his second with his Japanese teammate again providing the final pass. \nIt was 3-0 at the break, but Augsburg striker Raul Bobadilla pulled a goal back when he out-jumped Mats Hummels from a free-kick to head home on 49 minutes. \nIt proved to be no more than a consolation as Aubameyang grabbed his second on 85 minutes, then took advantage of another good Kagawa pass to delay his shot before beating goalkeeper Roman Burki on 91 minutes. \nGladbach floor Schalke \nTen-man Schalke stay third despite their 3-1 defeat at Borussia Moenchengladbach, who earned their fifth straight win under caretaker coach Andre Schubert which has taken them from bottom to seventh in the table. \nLars Stindl’s first-half penalty for Borussia was cancelled out by an own goal by Denmark defender Andreas Christensen before Brazil striker Raffael curled in a free kick on 70 minutes. \nSchalke had midfielder Johannes Geis sent off on 80 minutes for stamping Andre Hahn’s knee before defender Julian Korb scored Gladbach’s third on 84 minutes. \nOn Saturday, Arjen Robben netted on his return from injury as Bayern Munich romped to a 4-0 home win against Cologne to claim their 10 th straight win this season and 1000 th victory in the Bundesliga. \nNetherlands captain Robben scored in his first match since August after being sidelined with a groin strain while Arturo Vidal, Lewandowski and Thomas Mueller also got on the scoresheet. \nWolfsburg stayed fourth with a 1-0 win at Darmstadt as Daniel Caligiuri hit their 78 th minute winner. \nFresh from their 4-4 draw at home to Roma in the Champions League on Tuesday, Bayer Leverkusen had to come from 2-0 down before beating Stuttgart 4-3 in another thriller. \nThe victory lifted Leverkusen to sixth while Stuttgart remain in the bottom three. \nNigeria striker Anthony Ujah scored twice as Werder Bremen broke their five-match losing streak with a 3-1 win at Mainz where Japan striker Yoshinori Muto scored the hosts’ consolation goal in the 90 th minute. \nThe result lifted Bremen out of the relegation zone and up to 14 th while Mainz dropped to 13 th . \nMidfielder Marc Stendera was Eintracht Frankfurt’s star with both of their second-half goals in a 2-1 comeback victory at Hanover 96, who hang just above the relegation places. \nHertha Berlin are fifth after their 1-0 win at Bavarian side Ingolstadt on Saturday night when ex-Bayern Munich midfielder Mitchell Weiser scored the winner after just 11 minutes. \nTen-man Hoffenheim are second-from-bottom after their 1-0 defeat to Hamburg on Friday thanks to Pierre-Michel Lasogga’s late winner. \nHoffenheim’s Bosnian defender Ermin Bicakcic was sent off for a second yellow card. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:56:39.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
