I didn't know at the time that so many were written by him.\"\nBerns died in 1967 at 38, leaving a legacy of hit songs including \"Twist and Shout,\" ''Are You Lonely for Me,\" ''Tell Him,\" ''I Want Candy,\" ''Hang on Sloopy\" and \"Everybody Needs Somebody to Love.\" The musical opened off-Broadway in 2014 with a book by Daniel Goldfarb and arrangements by Garry Sherman, who worked with Berns on many of his hits.\nThe new producing team also includes Joe Grano, a producer of the Tony Award-winning musical \"Jersey Boys,\" and Maureen Van Zandt, Steven's wife who is co-artistic director of Renegade Theatre Company and who brought Steven to the off-Broadway production.\n\"Bert Burns died so young, so tragically young, that even within the industry, only the insiders know about him. He was a phenomenal talent. The list of songs was remarkable,\" said Steven Van Zandt, who also credited Burns with bringing Latin rhythms and scales to the mainstream.\n\"It's a great show, first of all. If it wasn't entertaining, none of this would matter,\" said the former \"Lilyhammer\" star and Bruce Springsteen guitarist who produced the recent reuniting of The Rascals. \"It has to be entertaining first, but if it can teach us a little history accidentally or in the meantime, that's nice, too.\"\nThe new production is still many months away and no casting was revealed or specific dates.\nAs a producer, Steven Van Zandt said he'll concentrate on preserving the integrity of the music. He said that pop music when it's performed on Broadway often gets sped up, a process he calls \"showbiz-ization.\"\n\"I think we're probably going to defend against that,\" he said.\nFor his part, Shaffer attended a reading of the show this year and said he'll try his best to \"tell the story in the manner that will make Bert be exciting and talented character for everybody that I know he was.\"\n___\nOnline: http://pieceofmyheartmusical.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
