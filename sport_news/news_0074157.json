According to Sanchez, Lemieux would be made to realize, at some point, that the only safe place for him against the unified 160-pound title holder would be on the ropes and on defense.\nIt didn’t take long for Golovkin to make clear the painful wisdom of that advice as he pounded Lemieux into submission at 1:32 of the eighth one-sided round of the night, thus putting an ever firmer stranglehold on the future of the middleweight division.\nA huge roar went up from a highly partisan sold out Madison Square Garden crowd of 20,548 when Golovkin began his ring walk. By then Lemieux had already entered the ring to a polite response but it paled to the feverish reaction to the first sight of Golovkin’s long blue and gold robe with the familiar G-G-G stitching on the back.\nIn his HBO pay-per-view debut, Golovkin (34-0, 31 KOs) wore a confident smirk as he was announced while Lemieux (34-3, 31 KOs) wore a look of concern that would soon become well justified.\nBoth fighters opened up cautiously with Golovkin staying behind his jab and landing firmly while Lemieux appeared tight, his punches mostly falling short of the mark until Golovkin nailed him with an overhand right that knocked him back.\nWith 50 seconds left in Round 4, Golovkin landed a hard left hook, followed by a left-right combination that staggered Lemieux backward. Seeing Lemieux off-balance and on the defensive, Golovkin waded in and landed a string of lefts and rights before stepping back as Lemieux lay on the ropes. When he came off, he was greeted with the first of several snapping jabs that had his greased hair flying and his supporters in mounting despair.\nJust as the bell was about to sound to end Round 5, Golovkin dropped Lemieux with a left to the body, sending him to one knee so quickly Golovkin nailed him with a right hand for good measure when he was down.\nGolovkin apologetically retreated thereafter but the damage was done and the end was soon in sight as he attacked him to open the sixth round..\nTo his credit, Lemieux tried to fire back and landed several times when Golovkin got careless but to no good end.\nBy then Golovkin was outlanding Lemieux 3-1 according to CompuBox statistics and the effect had begun to show. Referee Steve Willis stopped the action with 1:54 to go in Round 7 to have the ringside physician examine Lemieux’s bloody face. He allowed the fight to continue but to no avail for the IBF champion, whose features were beginning to dissolve into a mask of pain.\nAt the end of the round Lemieux walked toward his corner with his head down, a look of dejection and loss in his eyes. He had no answers for the jab that was tearing up his face, nor the resolve to take many more of the thudding body shots Golovkin was thrusting into his ribcage like the police knocking down the apartment door of a criminal suspect with a battering ram.\nAnother left to the body began the inevitable conclusion, midway through the eighth round. It caved in Lemieux’s side and Golovkin jumped forward, landing two straight rights to the face and another left on the ropes as Willis closed in, looking for any excuse to stop it. Lemieux gave it to him when he backed up from another Golovkin assault and wobbled to his left, eying his attacker both wearily and worriedly. Two more punches and Willis had Lemieux in a saving embrace, ending a one-sided mugging that reminded one of the way Marvin Hagler used to take opponents apart, piece by piece.\nThe win was Golovkin’s 21st straight stoppage and handed him ownership of the IBF title Lemieux entered the ring wearing along with the WBA, IBO and interim WBC titles he already held. More importantly, he made a loud case for the winner of the November WBC title fight between Miguel Cotto and Saul “Canelo” Alvarez to take him on if, in fact, they actually want to settle who is the best middleweight in the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:42:06.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
