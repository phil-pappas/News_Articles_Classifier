He was the in-charge of Guru Nanak Pura police post here at the time of the incident. Mal had, in January, allegedly colluded with a woman and two others for extorting Rs 5 lakh from a schoolteacher, Mange Ram, 50, by threatening to frame him in a rape case. The SI and others had already extracted Rs 1.5 lakh from the teacher. The victim approached the State Vigilance Bureau (SVB) before delivering the next instalment of extortion money. The SVB had, on January 15, arrested Gurmej Kaur (35), Malkiat Singh and his nephew Gurjinder Singh when Ram delivered them the second instalment of Rs 1.5 lakh. Mal, who was the prime accused, managed to flee. “The SI had obtained an affidavit from Gurmej, in which she claimed that Ram had raped her. He used the affidavit to blackmail the teacher. What raised suspicion was that the woman’s complaint was neither found in the records of the police post nor anywhere else in the police department,” said Inspector Bhupender Sharma, in-charge, SVB police station, Fatehabad. He said Mal and his accomplices had been booked under Section 384 of the IPC and Sections 7, 8 and 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act. Malkiat and Gurjinder are relatives of Khem Chand, who had kidnapped a former SP’s daughter in 2001 and was later killed in an encounter with the Fatehabad police. Fatehabad SP Sangeeta Kalia, who joined here nearly a month after Mal’s absconding, said the SI had been declared a proclaimed offender and the police were raiding his suspected hideouts. Arjuna awardee in soup Hisar: Jai Bhagwan, an Arjuna awardee boxer inspector, who is posted SHO at the Adampur police station in the district, has landed in controversy after a trader levelled allegations of taking bribe against him. Superintendent of Police Satender Gupta has transferred Jai Bhagwan to the Police Lines and assigned a probe into the matter. Mukesh Goyal, an Adampur trader, alleged the SHO came to his shop on August 31 and took his younger brother Ravi and four others in custody under the Gambling Act. He alleged the SHO demanded Rs 1 lakh for releasing the accused. The trader submitted a complaint to the SP about the incident and demanded an inquiry. The SP said DSP Jaipal Singh had been asked to conduct an inquiry into the complaint.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:15:10.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
