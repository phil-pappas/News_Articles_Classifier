But he knew what he was doing.”\nFriday’s game lacked the tension-laced theatrics that unfolded throughout Toronto’s opening playoff round against the Texas Rangers, a best-of-five affair that the Blue Jays won 3-2.\nThe Royals drew first blood, scoring twice in the bottom of the third inning for a 2-0 lead.\nAlex Gordon got it going with a leadoff double and scored when Alcides Escobar sliced a hit just inside the bag at first.\nWith Escobar standing at second, Lorenzo Cain grounded through the right side for a single that carded Escobar.\nCain remains hot as the hit extended his post-season hit streak to 10 games.\nSalvadore Perez stepped into the batter’s box for K.C. with two out in the fourth and cranked his third home run of the current postseason off Toronto starter Marco Estrada to left to increase the Royals lead to 3-0.\nEstrada pitched well enough to win but was done in by the lack of offence, allowing three runs off six hits while striking out six over 5 1/3 innings to get saddled with the loss.\nWorking with the lead, Volquez was pushed to the limit in the sixth inning, during which the Blue Jays did everything they could to crack his shell.\nWith Josh Donaldson and Jose Bautista drawing back-to-back walks to lead off the inning, it marked the first time in the game that Toronto had two base runners on in the same inning.\nA visibly tiring Volquez, his pitch count already over 100, had to dig deep and it started when he struck out Edwin Encarnacion looking. Encarnacion was later forced to leave the game to have X-rays on his left middle finger. He was diagnosed with a ligament strain.\nChris Colabello then lined out to left before Troy Tulowitzki was left gaping at a called third strike, a 95-mile-an-hour sinker, to dash Toronto’s hopes.\nVolquez left the game after throwing 111 pitches, 37 of them in the sixth.\nThe Royals scored two more runs in the eighth inning off reliever LaTroy Hawkins.\nFollow us on Twitter: @Globe_Sports\nMore Related to this Story Kelly: Blue Jays can find success with an average Price on the mound\nRoyals 5, Blue Jays 0 (Kansas City leads ALCS 1-0) Kelly: Toronto’s thin pitching a worrying sight\nBlue Jays vs. Royals: Is the summer of bad blood behind them?\nTopics: Kansas City Royals American League Toronto Blue Jays Kansas City, Kansas Comments Print /\nLicense A A", "external_links": ["http://license.icopyright.net/3.8425?icx_id=26861521", "https://twitter.com/@Globe_Sports", "http://license.icopyright.net/g2/3.8425?icx_id=26861521", "http://embed.sendtonews.com/player2/embedcode.php?fk=Nq7D0Exu&cid=5240"], "published": "2015-10-17T08:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:47:12.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
