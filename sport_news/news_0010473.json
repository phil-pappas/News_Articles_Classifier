The Rangers defeated the Flames 4-1. Mandatory Credit: Andy Marlin-USA TODAY Sports Article Report an error \nNEW YORK -- Dan Girardi broke a tie late in the second period on a night when he passed Mark Messier for 10th on the Rangers' career games played list and New York beat the Calgary Flames 4-1 on Sunday. \nOscar Lindberg, Kevin Klein and Derick Brassard also scored. The Rangers (6-2-2) have won three of their last five and earned points in all five games. \nAntti Raanta made 22 saves in New York's third of 17 back-to-back sets this season -- the Rangers lost to the Flyers in a shootout Saturday night. New York has won six of its past seven against the Flames. \nIn his 769th game with New York, Girardi scored his first this season to put the Rangers ahead 2-1 with 3:03 left in the second. Recently demoted to the third defence pairing with Keith Yandle, Girardi snuck down to the right circle and snapped a rebound of Emerson Etem's shot past Jonas Hiller. \nJiri Hudler scored the Flames' lone goal. \nJETS 5, WILD 4 \nWINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Drew Stafford scored twice and Blake Wheeler had two assists to help Winnipeg beat Minnesota. \nMinnesota's Jason Zucker scored 10 seconds into the game, but then Winnipeg got five consecutive goals. \nBryan Little tied it 1:22 into the first, Andrew Ladd scored about 2 minutes later and Nikolaj Ehlers made it 3-1 Jets (5-2-1) midway through the period. \nStafford scored 51 seconds into the second, chasing Wild goalie Darcy Kuemper. Stafford scored again on Devan Dubnyk just under 4 minutes later for his team-leading fifth goal this season. \nWheeler extended his season-opening point streak to a franchise-record eight games. Michael Hutchinson made 26 saves for Winnipeg. \nMikko Koivu, Justin Fontaine and Zach Parise also scored for Minnesota (5-2-1). \nKINGS 3, OILERS 2 \nEDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Tanner Pearson broke a tie late in the third period with his first goal since breaking his leg last season and Los Angeles beat Edmonton for its fifth straight win. \nPearson's power-play goal put the Kings ahead with 3:26 left. He found the rebound from Jake Muzzin's shot and slapped it past goalie Cam Talbot. \nConnor McDavid nearly tied it for Edmonton with 5.2 seconds left, but Jonathan Quick sprawled to catch his backhander right at the goal line. A replay review upheld the no-goal call. \nPearson's score came fewer than 3 minutes after Taylor Hall tied it for Edmonton on the power play. Hall redirected a pass from Ryan Nugent-Hopkins for his third of the season. \nAnze Kopitar and Jeff Carter also scored for the Kings. Drew Doughty had two assists. \nMcDavid set up Benoit Pouliot's first-period goal with an impressive sprint toward the net around a defender.
