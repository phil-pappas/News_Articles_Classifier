It includes improvements and fixes to gameplay, Connected Franchise, Madden Ultimate Team, and more. Check out the details below. GAMEPLAY Addressed issue where if a team called a time out on the safety punt, they would then be able to kick a regular kickoff Addressed issue where sometimes a defender would have a poor pursuit angle toward the ball carrier if the ball carrier was breaking a tackle during a catch Addressed issue where sometimes defensive linemen would freeze for the remainder of the play after being knocked to the ground Addressed issue where the defense would not adjust alignment if the CPU controlled offensive team enacted a concept audible Updated Individual Coverage adjustments to not only affect the pre-snap shading but also the post play leverage technique Addressed issue where adjusting the ZONE shading would have an effect on the defenders drop location instead of just the leverage technique Addressed issue where cancelling a PA Fake would allow for a 1-step drop on certain plays Addressed issue where the game clock would be restarted of a declined penalty after an incomplete pass Addressed issue where safeties in Cover 4 Deep assignments were reacting to run too quickly CONNECTED FRANCHISE Addressed issue where defensive holding slider would reset when exiting the screen Addressed issue where accelerated clock would not work in H2H CFM games Addressed issue where visual feedback settings were pulling from the users profile instead of league settings Addressed issue where some settings would carry back to the FE after playing a CFM game Addressed issue where the CPU would retain an empty roster spot when simming to the regular season when there is a player on Injured Reserve (note: changes arent reflected until after your current season is finished) Addressed issue where the user could not sort player while in the Fantasy draft board Removed Kick Return as a scoutable trait (note: changes wont be reflected until after your current season is finished) CFM Trade tuning Addressed issue in CFM H2H where uniforms would change back to default home/away even after changing them in the team select screen Addressed a rare issue that caused some Franchise files to be corrupted, preventing players from accessing their CFM (note: this wont repair already corrupted files, and only prevents future occurrences) MADDEN ULTIMATE TEAM MUT Play a Friend quarter length boosted to four minutes from two minutes In MUT H2H Seasons and Draft Champions H2H Draft, terminating the game during the load screen will give the quitter a loss and the opponent a win.

Have you tested this yourself, or are you going off the patch notes? # 4 tubaSimulator @ 09/30/15 06:00 AM Am I the only one who got the feeling while reading through the patch notes that EA hasn't really fixed anything of significance? They've fixed a bunch of stuff but I just can't see that they've fixed anything that actually makes a difference to CFM or anything that people reported on this forum. I don't remember everything that people said EA needed to address for CFM so maybe someone who has a better overview might care to comment. But the patch was not what I expected to say the least.. # 5 J1Warrior @ 09/30/15 06:24 AM I don't have Internet till friday, just moved, so I was wondering if when I download the patches if I could play a regular solo cfm offline with drive goals enabled if the confidence and overall cfm is fixed to be playable without doing the workaround? Thanks for any help and I haven't seen anything posted about this so I'm sorry if this was covered already. # 6 tubaSimulator @ 09/30/15 06:26 AM Quote: Originally Posted by J1Warrior I don't have Internet till friday, just moved, so I was wondering if when I download the patches if I could play a regular solo cfm offline with drive goals enabled if the confidence and overall cfm is fixed to be playable without doing the workaround? Thanks for any help and I haven't seen anything posted about this so I'm sorry if this was covered already. As far as I can see from the patch notes they haven't addressed anything related to drive goals or overall. All the patch notes are in the first post in this thread so scroll up # 7 R9NALD9 @ 09/30/15 06:32 AM Although I appreciate the fact that we have had 2 patches within the first month after release...I can't help but be dissapointed with this patch. They haven't fixed any of the major issues people complain about... Will probably trade this in for Star Wars next month. # 8 saybur @ 09/30/15 06:37 AM Still nothing about ridiculous sim stats or the problem they cause with drastic OLine regression? What about players being stuck on the injury report with no injury until their contract expires? No tuning of the draft class ratings? No safeties over 85 spd, CB's with more strength than safety's and DE's, a severe lack of big (330+) DT's. Color me disappointed. # 9 tubaSimulator @ 09/30/15 06:50 AM I'm very disappointed as well and here's why: Here are the issues raised in the pre-patch thread that needed to be addressed to fix CFM (note, all these issues are related to CFM, no other game mode). All these issues listed were issues that kept me from starting my CFM hoping they would be addressed in patch #2, but NONE of them were addressed. - Force wins resulting in ridiculous results (I don't care too much about this one) - Drive goals/confidence issues - Non-scrambling QBs like Peyton Manning scrambling a lot; Scrambling QBs like Russell Wilson do not scramble - Auto subs - issues with resigning players (resign logic) - issues with draft classes (speed issue) - LT regression issue - QB regression issue (AWR, INJ, DAC) As far as I can tell, none of these were addressed. Maybe someone cares about not being able to sort while in fantasy draft board, but I don't see how it fixes any issues in CFM. Very disappointed. \"Addressed over 100 bug and stability issues\" Play the game then report back. Already people moaning and groaning based on notes. Play the game first. In the meantime the only thing I do not see that I really wanted to see and I will go play and test this before commenting is the defensive camera view. It does not work like Madden 15 I hope this is one of the 100 bug and stability issues fixes. Going to test things out here today. Still love this game regardless. It's the best Madden I have ever played on the field top to bottom. # 11 Steve_OS @ 09/30/15 07:02 AM Confirmed available for Xbox One. (273 MB) # 12 SolidSquid @ 09/30/15 07:04 AM So shading might actually be effective now? # 13 BleedGreen710 @ 09/30/15 07:14 AM very disappointed. really wanted to see some changes to improve the quality of life of long franchises. as it stands now you cant progress players realistically (dont get enough xp) and the draft classes are flawed in some key areas (no safetys over 85 speed and cornerbacks having incredible strength is the most glaring). in addition, its near impossible to progress defensive players at all due to their goals being things like pass deflections and interceptions which you cant control. also - when all your corners have goal to get 5 INT obviously not all of them can meet it so some will just not make any gains at all. the whole XP/goals system is a damn mess. also, I cant believe nothing was touched with the drive goals. we have multiple threads here (some even stickied) with like 30+ pages of people trying to come up with WORK AROUNDS to the drive goals - and they dont even change it at all. hey i guess in their defense its easier to have us come up with work arounds then to pay employees to come up with a solution to the problem! I love this years game I give it a solid 9/10 and its just SO CLOSE to being a 10. I really hope there is going to be another patch down the road. I guess on the bright side i dont have to worry about restarting my franchise. # 14 tubaSimulator @ 09/30/15 07:14 AM Quote: Originally Posted by Armor and Sword \"Addressed over 100 bug and stability issues\" Play the game then report back.

It's the best Madden I have ever played on the field top to bottom. I will start up my CFM and test, I just posted my initial impression of the patch. The \"100 general bug and stability issues\" were not listed under CFM so I understood that as not addressing bugs and issues in CFM. IIRC you also listed a bunch of issues you wanted EA to address and none of them were. Anyway, I agree that we need to play and test before moaning, but as I said, it was not meant to be moaning, just posting my initial reaction to the patch which I think we should be allowed to do without it being labelled 'moaning'. # 15 garyraymond23 @ 09/30/15 07:19 AM I initially thought the entire point of this patch was to address the LT regression issue as well as the QB AWR/DAC issues but apparently I was wrong. It is what it is at this point for CFM, I wish I didn't wait to start a new one tho lol. # 16 booker21 @ 09/30/15 07:26 AM No confidence fix, no qb scramble fix either. Really? Oh well.

It's the best Madden I have ever played on the field top to bottom. I'm w/ you, I'm happy w/ my 32 team offline cfm already, the regression stuff doesn't affect me or the confidence drive goals b/c I'm playing each game on the schedule w/ 32 team offline. Never downloaded the tuner to begin with and haven't seen the issue w/ qb scrambling stuff. They always have alot of stuff addressed that aren't listed, let's just play on folks! Best Madden ever! I can confirm with great enthusisim that the defensive camera has been fixed # 19 Millennium @ 09/30/15 07:34 AM Quote: Originally Posted by Armor and Sword I can confirm with great enthusisim that the defensive camera has been fixed See folks? Please play with the patch and confirm your issue still exists before commenting.
