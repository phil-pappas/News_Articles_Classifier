I liked our start, but then we self-destruct.” \nGuess how that feels for the bench boss. \n“I could feel the guys on the bench getting down,” said Hartley, well aware the questions regarding his goaltenders will come yet again before next game. “Then they scored a third and a fourth one for different reasons. Right now, that’s where we have to show some character. We have to roll up our sleeves and be ready for any kinds of adversity.” \nBut they’re not showing resiliency. \nInstead of buckling down, the Flames became softer than I Can’t Believe It’s Not Butter in their defensive zone. \nSure, you can’t pin the whole loss on Ramo, who was pulled after surrendering a pair of markers 41 seconds apart later in the frame which left the Flames down 4-1, but that go-ahead goal is the kind of costly marker that’s helping torpedo this squad and made worse with all the Keystone Cops activity. \n“You can’t blame Rams on those,” argued Flames centre Matt Stajan. “The one he bobbled, yeah, it’s gonna happen. We’ve gotta box-out. We can’t be pointing fingers … He made a ton of saves in the first period for us, and we were still in it, and then if you leave guys wide-open in front for easy goals in the scoring areas, you’re not going to win.” \nOh yeah, there’s another element missing if the Flames want to salvage their season before really hitting the iceberg. \n“When we get scored on, we’re definitely not coming out with the extra jam we need the next shift, and we’re losing momentum, and it’s snowballing,” pointed out Flames defenceman Dennis Wideman. “When things aren’t going well, it seems to snowball pretty quick, and things aren’t going well right now.” \nOFF THE GLASS \nFor those wondering, the Flames have now been outscored 11-2 in second periods this season. It’s hard to win games with that trend … With the return of Joe Colborne from the broken thumb suffered in the pre-season, the Flames reassigned C Markus Granlund to the AHL Stockton Heat. Granlund played one game in his most recent summons … Speaking of injuries, it’s getting curious with D Ladislav Smid, who believes he’s ready to play and has felt that way for a couple of weeks now. With next week’s stretch of five games in seven nights, which includes two sets of games on back-to-back nights, they’ll have to be prepared in case a defenceman is needed. That said, we’re talking about a blueliner who hasn’t played since January and could likely use a conditioning assignment in the minors before suiting up … No shortage of scouts in attendance at last night’s game. The list had 14 from 13 different teams, among them Anaheim Ducks GM Bob Murray. \nIN THE CREASE \nCapitals head coach Barry Trotz has some lofty expectations for captain, Ovechkin’s future. Now in his 11th season, Ovechkin upped his career totals to 479 goals and 901 points. “He’s got probably 10 good years in him, and at this pace, he’ll probably be the greatest goal scorer in the history of the game,” Trotz said. “It wouldn’t surprise me.” Wayne Gretzky holds the mark at 894 … As poorly as the Flames are playing — and it’s poor — another factor is the other team’s are amped up to face them. “They’re not flying under the radar,” said Capitals defenceman and off-season Calgary resident Karl Alzner. “Everyone knows they’re good now, and you come in expecting a really, really hard game, and teams are better prepared.”… With his first-period goal, Sean Monahan now has 99 career points, not that reaching 100 is on his mind these days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:19:19.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
