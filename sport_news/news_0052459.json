The rules , if followed carefully, would mean no cookie should hurt you, especially if it's the first time you're getting high.\nExperienced medical marijuana users consider the proposed rules too restrictive, Noelle Crombie of The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. Weak dosing per serving – 5 milligrams of marijuana's psychoactive component THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol – means more edible product must be bought and consumed for the medically purposeful high. But Oregonians experimenting with newly available recreational pot for the first time – or those adults who are very occasional users – will likely appreciate the state-mandated baby steps.\nRules applying to edibles for medical marijuana clients, meanwhile, allow the cumulative dosing per package of edibles to be twice that of packaged edibles sold for recreational use – small consolation for the experienced, perhaps, but a nod to the fact that medical marijuana users are more targeted in their use of the drug.\nEditorial Agenda 2015\nMake Portland a city that works Get pot right Smart choices for education\nHelp rural Oregon\nKeep people and goods moving\nFoster small business growth\nTrack health reforms\nRead more about the editorial board's priorities for Oregon.\nSharp per-serving potency limits could blunt potentially traumatizing accidents. While the draft rules are written for a legal, adult audience, they provide an especially valuable safeguard in cases where adult buyers are negligent at home in failing to keep marijuana-infused edibles away from the busy hands of kids and curious teenagers. A pot high for underage folks is undesirable, not to mention illegal. But a runaway high to a frightened youth or occasional adult user, whether by accident or miscalculation, is unacceptable. Oregon can avoid some of the unfortunate outcomes seen early on in Colorado by keeping the per-serving dosing low.\nThe draft rules show other valuable stipulations, chiefly that marijuana show on its packaging a notice of \"activation time,\" or the time it will take for a user to feel the effects of the drug. And labels must clearly state that the product is to be kept away from children and that it is illegal to drive under the influence of marijuana. Armed with such information, as well as the promise of a 5-mg THC limit per edible serving, it seems only the truly self-destructive would override the instructions.\nOregon's limited and undramatic start in the retail sale of recreational marijuana has gone smoothly so far, a credit to purveyors who wish to get things right and to customers who have taken no public liberties. The OLCC's temporary draft rules lend rational limits to a market segment just taking shape -- part of a broader marijuana market that should, with reasonable oversight and discipline, prove to be as safe for everyone as it is profitable.\nThe OLCC will hold no hearing on its draft rules but accept comment on them through Friday, Oct. 16.", "external_links": ["http://www.oregon.gov/oha/mmj/Documents/Rulemaking/333-007-draft-labeling-and-concentration-rules.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-14T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:04:08.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
