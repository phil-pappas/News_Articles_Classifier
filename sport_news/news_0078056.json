Ira Winderman Contact Reporter Sun Sentinel Columnist Hassan Whiteside ready for new challenges as Heat's man in the middle \nIt was back during the time of simpler statistics, when you had points, rebounds and assists, and when Alonzo Mourning had plenty of the first two and not nearly as many of the latter. \nIt also was when Jack Ramsay was working Miami Heat games as a television analyst and readily accessible for his insights. \nQuestion: \"Are you concerned about Zo's lack of assists?\" \nRamsay (face scrunched with a look of incredulity, answer offered with typical Dr. Jack gusto): \"You don't need assists from him. You need him to dunk the ball.\" \nWhich brings us to Hassan Whiteside, the closest thing the Heat have had to Mourning since Mourning, a player who last season amassed a grand total of six assists in 48 games and 1,142 minutes. Spoelstra says Heat grew together during preseason \nErik Spoelstra sees positives and strides during preseson the Heat closed 4-4. \nErik Spoelstra sees positives and strides during preseson the Heat closed 4-4. \nBut a player who also averaged more points per touch in the halfcourt last season than any player averaging more than 12 minutes, at .849. \n\"If he can do that, I'll take it, even on three guys,\" coach Erik Spoelstra said. \nThat doesn't mean there also can't be more ball movement from the post when Whiteside is in the game, just as Mourning occasionally had to relent. To that end, assistant coach Juwan Howard has been set up as Whiteside's guide to the passing lanes. \n\"We've certainly watched film on it,\" Spoelstra said. \"Juwan has done a great job at drilling it and working on it. And then, within the five-on-five context of what we do, we constantly work on our ball movement, our spacing and making the appropriate basketball read. Spoelstra: No plans to tinker with starting lineup \nErik Spoelstra says the plan is to stick with Whiteside, Deng, Bosh, Wade, Dragic as his starting five for the foreseeable future. \nErik Spoelstra says the plan is to stick with Whiteside, Deng, Bosh, Wade, Dragic as his starting five for the foreseeable future. \n\"And that's the next stage of development for any good player.\" \nWhiteside believes he is up to the challenge. \n\"Just because you don't get assists doesn't mean you aren't passing the ball,\" he said. \"I can pass the ball, so whenever it opens up or happens, I'm going to pass it.\" \nLast season, as somewhat of a revelation, Whiteside hardly played as the focus of opposing defenses. The new kids rarely do. \nThis season, that assuredly will change. And that could mandate more passes out of the post, passes that might have to be threaded through a sea of arms. \n\"It's the next development of a player,\" Spoelstra said. \"When you go under the radar, people don't know who you are, you have man-to-man coverage and you're basically by yourself. When you start to get on somebody's scouting report, there's schemes for that. \n\"And so the first part of that is recognition. And that's a compliment, when teams start to pay more attention with you, with the weak-side defense either trying to dig or trap.\" \nLike an NFL quarterback, that necessitates a series of progressions for what to do next. \n\"Having awareness of that,\" Spoelstra said, \"we worked on that, to go through the check list, to always see a cutter, see the next guy, and then develop that next layer of making basketball decisions. \n\"There's two on the ball, that's the ultimate compliment.\" \nThat doesn't always mean passing. It merely means rapid risk/benefit assessment from a player who admittedly finds his greatest basketball pleasure from \"dunking on people.\" \n\"Hassan will probably get doubled more often on his offensive-rebound opportunities and he just has to continue to build his court awareness of where he is, where the trap is and who's open,\" Spoelstra said. \"But if he's in the paint, and even if you double him, I still like his chances to get something good for us.\" \nWhiteside said his international experience has him primed for the moment. \n\"I've had plenty of practice of playing overseas, getting double or tripled, so I'm not worried,\" he said. \"If they double, I'm going to pass it. I don't think I'm a selfish guy.\" \nIN THE LANE \nSURVEY SAYS: An annual rite of the preseason is players filling out the NBA questionnaire. There were more than a few interesting answers on the Heat forms. Not only did Chris Andersen list his favorite television shows as, \" How the Universe Works , Ancient Aliens and Ballers, \" but when asked about his hidden off-court talent, he listed \"bow hunting.\" Asked what he would be if he wasn't an NBA player, Chris Bosh answered, \"graphic designer.\" For his part, Dwyane Wade listed his favorite fashion accessory as his fedora. Showing that television can transcend cultural lines, when asked for his favorite television shows, Goran Dragic included Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and Friends . On his questionnaire, Josh McRoberts listed \"juggling\" as his hidden talent. Tyler Johnson one-upped him by listing his hidden talent as \"fake sneezing.\" More poignant was Gerald Green saying the moment that inspired him to start playing basketball was, \"when my grandmother wrote me a letter saying that I need to change my life.\" \nROOKIE OF THE WHERE: While fellow Duke product Grant Hill told NBA TVs \"Open Court\" that he could envision Heat first-round pick Justise Winslow as Rookie of the Year, Hill said what is more meaningful is the fit Winslow has found. \"He's going to a great situation,\" Hill said. \"He's going to Miami. He's going to learn from Wade and Bosh and sort of that Heat way with Pat Riley. And there won't the pressure on him to come in and put up big numbers his first year. And so it'll be interesting to see sort of how, as a young guy, while all young guys want to come in and do well and put up big numbers, but how he'll adapt and adjust and fit in that system down there.\" \nALL OR NOTHING: TNT analyst Reggie Miller sees the Heat season going one of two ways, and he's not sure which way. \"It will depend on health. How many games will Chris Bosh stay on the court, along with Dwyane Wade?\" he said. \"Having Chris Bosh back healthy and ready to go, and drafting Justise Winslow, I could easily see these guys as a top-four team. But if they aren't able to stay on the court, I can easily see the Heat barely scratching in and getting into the playoffs. However, talent-wise, they are top-four team.\" \nLOOKING BACK: Amid reflections of those in the Heat organization on their time with Lamar Odom on the roster, Detroit Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy offered his own thoughts of Odom's 2003-04 season with the Heat team that Van Gundy coached. \"As a player,\" Van Gundy told the media in Detroit amid Odom's health issues, \"he really was one of my all-time favorites. I've said that numerous times, not only a great player, but a great teammate that everybody enjoyed being around. The guy has had such a hard life in a lot of ways and was still such a positive person.\" \nNUMBER \n15-12. Heat record all-time in season openers, with their 2015-16 schedule beginning Wednesday against the visiting Charlotte Hornets at AmericanAirlines Arena. The Heat have won the last four times they opened their schedule at home and also are on a four-game winning streak overall in openers. \niwinderman@tribune.com.
