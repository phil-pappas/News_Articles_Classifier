She envisions the team being so popular that to keep all the players, she will need a junior varsity team.That's the mentality at Post these days: Embrace the interest in athletics, the excitement of the student-athletes and cooperation of the university's administration — and keep growing.With new athletic director Ronnie Palmer heeding the urging of President Dr. Don Mroz, Post is seeking to continue the growth of its athletic department by adding or beefing up its junior varsity programs in a number of sports.Palmer said he expects to have a junior varsity team in women's basketball next season. Already, he said, the men's soccer and baseball teams are utilizing jayvee programs this season. The lacrosse teams are also considering developmental teams.\"It shows that our coaches are working diligently to bring in quality student-athletes to add depth to their rosters,\" Palmer said. \"They are also looking at different avenues to provide opportunities to give their younger players some playing time.\"McWilliams-Franklin said that while she plans on keeping a maximum of 16 players on her team this year, she started the school year with 22 players and had more calling asking if they could beSee POST, Page 11Bpart of the program.\"I just don't have space even in a Division II program,\" McWilliams-Franklin said. \"So for me, the best of both worlds is to add a JV team. There are a lot of young basketball players out there that may have played in high school, but not at the level that would earn them a scholarship.\"I love providing an outlet for the kids who aren't quite good enough yet. If you are a truth athlete whose love for the game hasn't diminished, you can still have an opportunity to play on the junior varsity team.\"The program benefits, too, because it brings in players who can develop once they are on campus. A JV team adds depth, creates competition and also creates more recruiting opportunities.Division II schools like Post are constantly recruiting players from junior colleges. Those junior colleges will often play JV teams to get in extra games. That allows four-year schools with JV programs to actually play against many of the kids they are hoping to recruit.\"We want a JV team for a whole slew of reasons,\" baseball coach Ray Ricker said. \"Kids are seeing the steady progress we have made over the years, especially getting our first player drafted this season, so we are getting a lot of interest in our program. With a feeder program, it will help us get guys more reps, because you don't develop just sitting on the bench. We will get them competition against junior colleges, and that will help us identify and recruit.\"Both Ricker and men's soccer coach Ted Haley prefer to view their subvarsity team as a developmental program. Both programs already aggressively recruit and have more than 40 players. They believe the added games a subvarsity team affords creates opportunities for more players to prove themselves.They both see their rosters being fluid without specific varsity or JV designation. Players who compete in developmental games won't be precluded from varsity action. Players won't be allowed to play more than the NCAA mandated limit of games, but they could be shifted from one level to the next to gain more valuable experience.\"We have guys that start in one area and move into the first team very quickly,\" Haley said. \"Other sports kind of have that junior varsity logo to them, but soccer is more of a developmental system we take very, very seriously.\"We will play matches against junior colleges, and get our guys who don't get a ton of regular time into those matches. These are really very, very talented players. It's just a matter of getting them experience and letting them develop and grow.\"Post's athletic department has grown significantly in the last few years. The school has added eight varsity sports to bring the total to 22. Now the Eagles are looking beyond that to ways to beef up existing programs and provide more opportunities for student-athletes.\"I know for me growing up, baseball was always the carrot on the end of the string that kept me focused on my schoolwork,\" Ricker said. \"If we can do that by allowing more kids the chance to keep playing baseball or other sports and enjoy their college experience at Post, it is a win-win for everybody.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:57:19.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
