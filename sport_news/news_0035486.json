South) each tallied 11 kills and sophomore Carissa Jones (Hammond, Ind./Bishop Noll) added 10 kills to lead a trio of Peregrine offensive leaders. \nJones hit a team-best .304 and had a double-double with 11 digs, while senior teammate Akeelah Muhammad (Chicago Heights, Ill./Bloom Township) added six kills on a .286 attack percentage and four block assists. \nThe Peregrines dominated at the net, recording a whopping 22 block assists and 13 total blocks – both season highs. Pasko (nine digs) and sophomore Kayla Elsea (Palmyra, Ind./Crawford County) each had seven block assists and Martin (eight digs) and Muhammad added one solo block each. \nSetter Carley Bartolini (Chesterton, Ind./Portage) dished out 37 assists and eight digs in the match. \nAll three matches were tight, as a Muhammad solo block sealed the match in Set 1 after PNC battled back from a 22-15 deficit to force it to 27. Purdue Calumet jumped out to a 5-1 lead in the second set behind three-straight kills from Martin, Jones and Elsea before PNC again made up the deficit to tie at 7 and again at 11-all. \nWith the Peregrines leading, 24-23, Muhammad again ended it with a kill to capture Set 2. Purdue Calumet trailed for the beginning of the third set, 11-5, before making a comeback of its own with a 8-2 run to knot the score at 14-all. Three late kills by Martin and another by Pasko – plus two attack errors from PNC to end it – helped seal the Set 3 win. \nTaylor Mullen led the Panthers with 11 kills and 11 digs, Cami Webster had 17 digs and Abbe Mullen totaled 29 assists to lead the Purdue North Central in the setback. Caylyn Bellar added three block assists and Robin Osmolski had two solo blocks for the Panthers at the net. \nPurdue Calumet completes a quick turnaround Wednesday, when the Peregrines host Moody Bible in a 7 p.m. nonconference match at the Fitness and Recreation Center. Wednesday night is also Faculty and Staff Appreciation Night, as the Peregrines offer free admission to all Purdue Calumet faculty and staff members.
