The Cowboys forged their own identity as the NFL's team of the 1990s with those three Super Bowls in four seasons.\nWhen we see great football around here, we know it.\nSo sit back and enjoy the chance to watch some truly great football Sunday when the NFL's best dynasty of all time comes wheeling into AT&T Stadium to play the battered and bruised Cowboys.\nThe best of all time? That would be the New England Patriots.\nYou'll get an argument from fans of the 1950s Browns, 1960s Packers, 1970s Steelers, 1980s 49ers and maybe even the 1990s Cowboys. But you cannot argue the numbers. Since Tom Brady stepped in as quarterback of the Patriots in 2001, no team in NFL history has been able to stay this good, this long.\nOver these last 14 seasons, the Patriots have won 12 AFC East titles and reached nine AFC title games and six Super Bowls. They have won four Lombardi trophies. And with a 3-0 start to this season, the meter continues to run on the greatness of the Pats.\nOnly two other franchises can compete with the quality and duration of the New England dynasty -- the Cleveland Browns of Paul Brown and the San Francisco 49ers of Bill Walsh and George Seifert. Or, if you prefer, the 49ers of Joe Montana and Steve Young.\nBrown's Browns dominated the All-America Conference from 1946 through 1949, winning all four championships before the NFL absorbed the three best teams from that league in 1950. Cleveland's championship ways continued in the new league as the Browns won the title in their NFL debut season and twice more in the middle of the decade.\nDuring an 18-year span from 1949 through 1963, the Browns qualified for the playoffs 12 times, won 11 conference titles and seven championships. Cleveland won 75.4 percent of its games over those 18 seasons. Browns owner Art Modell fired Brown after a 10-4 season in 1963, and Cleveland promptly won their eighth NFL title in 1964 with Blanton Collier coaching Brown's players.\nOver an 18-year span from 1981-98, the 49ers qualified for the playoffs 16 times, won 13 NFC West titles and reached 10 NFC title games. The 49ers won five of those NFC championships and all five of the Super Bowls they reached. Those 49ers won 71.5 percent of their games. But the 49ers did suffer one losing season during their run. The Browns never suffered a losing season under Paul Brown, and the Patriots have not endured a losing season in the Brady era.\nIn fact, New England has posted the best record in the AFC East in each of the last 14 seasons. In the two years the Patriots did not make the playoffs, New England lost division tie-breakers to the Jets (with shared 9-7 records) in 2002 and the Dolphins (with shared 11-5 records) in 2008. The Patriots achieved those 11 victories in 2008 despite the absence of Brady for the final 15 games with a knee injury.\nThe Patriots have slapped championship bookends on their dynasty with Lombardi trophies in 2001 and 2014. The Browns went the final six years of the Paul Brown era without a title and the 49ers the final four years of the Montana-Young era without hoisting the Lombardi Trophy. New England also has won 76.3 percent of its games since 2001 and, as I mentioned earlier, the winning doesn't appear to be ending any time soon.\nThe cast has rotated over the years but the backbone of the New England success has been twofold. The Patriots have one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time in Brady and one of the best defensive minds of all time in head coach Bill Belichick.\nHis defensive gameplan against the Greatest Show on Turf in the 2002 delivered the Patriots one of the biggest Super Bowl upsets of all time and that first Lombardi Trophy against the St. Louis Rams. Belichick's genius also has allowed the Patriots to dominate their meetings against Peyton Manning, a five-time NFL MVP who will leave football with all the significant career passing marks. Manning is 6-12 against the Belichick Patriots.\nBrady has been a three-time Super Bowl MVP (2002, 2004 and 2015) and a two-time NFL MVP (2007 and 2010). He passed for a then-record 50 touchdowns in 2007 as the Patriots were rolling to 16 consecutive victories -- only the second perfect regular season in NFL history.\nBrady's mind and arm can compensate for any shortcomings of the Patriots, whether they be blocking, running or tackling. If you let the Patriots hang around in a game, they're going to beat you. Brady has engineered 47 fourth-quarter game-winning drives, including nine in the playoffs and four in Super Bowls.\nBut the concern for the Tony Romo-and-Dez Bryant-less Cowboys Sunday shouldn't be the fourth quarter. It should be just reaching the fourth quarter with the game still competitive against Brady and Belichick.\nThat hasn't happened too often in the last 15 years.\nListen to Rick Gosselin at 10:50 a.m. Tuesdays on Sportsradio 1310 AM/96.7 FM The Ticket with Norm Hitzges, and follow @RickGosselinDMN on Twitter\nGreg Hardy: Should you root for him?\nCowlishaw: If you expected contrition from Hardy, you haven't been paying attention\n10 things you might not know about new Cowboy Greg Hardy\nNational reaction to Hardy comments about Brady's wife, coming out 'guns blazing': Hasn't learned; 'worst possible metaphor'\nStaubach's daughter says Hardy 'can't be made a hero'; Cowboys need to hold him accountable\nColumnist blasts Cowboy: Ray Rice apologizes, shunned; Greg Hardy doesn't, welcomed\nLatest news/updates\nRookie Lucky Whitehead set to make debut | LB Sean Lee will play | QB Matt Cassel to be active\nThe impact of Greg Hardy, Rolando McClain on Cowboys: 'Good to have some SOBs'\nBill Belichick goes into great detail about how he learned the Tom Landry shift\nA look at one big reason why Cowboys haven't been able to recreate winning formula of '14\nNext up: Patriots\nCowboys gameday: How Dallas matches up with New England, expert picks, keys to a victory and more\nOur experts' Week 5 NFL picks: Anybody got the Cowboys vs. the Patriots?\n10 things Cowboys fans should know about the Patriots, including how Tom Brady spends his bye week\nPodcast: NFL writer gives his Cowboys-Pats pick, says Cowboys should start Cassel, erred in not retaining Murray\nPeter King explains what the Cowboys need to do to beat the Patriots\nExpert analysis\nSherrington: The time to find out how well Matt Cassel knows the offense is getting close\nGosselin's NFL rankings: Why Giants, Redskins, Raiders are better than Cowboys\nCowlishaw: Why fans shouldn't expect Cowboys' O-line to match 2014 performance\nGosselin: Sorry, Cowboys fans, Patriots are the best NFL dynasty of all time\nFun stuff\nCowboys fans tell us what Tony Romo is thinking in Top 25 fan-made memes\nCowboys car replete with white leather, blue suede, 24-inch rims an ode to America's Team\nThe 20 funniest memes from Cowboys-Saints, including more DeMarco Murray trash talk\nMiss Carolyn Price flashes star-studded fingernails, rallies Cowboys fans for game vs. Patriots\n ", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/dallas-cowboys/cowboysheadlines/2015/10/07/podcast-nfl-writer-gives-cowboys-pats-pick-says-cowboys-start-cassel-erred-retaining-murray", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/dallas-cowboys/cowboys/2015/10/07/national-columnist-hypocrites-ray-rice-apologizes-shunned-greg-hardy-welcomed", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/dallas-cowboys/cowboysheadlines/2015/10/08/cowlishaw-expected-contrition-hardy-paying-attention", "https://twitter.com/RickGosselinDMN", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/dallas-cowboys/cowboysheadlines/2015/10/08/staubachs-daughter-says-hardy-made-hero-cowboys-need-hold-accountable"], "published": "2015-10-09T19:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:50:57.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
