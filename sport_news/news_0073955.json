(AP) â€” Stephen Curry scored 14 of his 19 points in the second quarter and the Golden State Warriors beat the Houston Rockets 123-101 on Thursday night in a rematch of last year's Western Conference finals. James Harden (right knee contusion), Dwight Howard (lower back tightness) and Ty Lawson (torso contusion) remained behind in Houston to get treatment. ROCKETS: K.J. McDaniels had 20 points and eight rebounds. . Second-round pick Montrezl Harrell had nine points and eight boards. . The Rockets committed seven turnovers in the first quarter. WARRIORS: Curry shot 6 for 7 and added six assists. . Klay Thompson had 16 points. . Andrew Bogut spent the second half on the bench with a broken nose he sustained while trying to stop a dunk. MO BUCKETS: With Bogut sitting, Marreese Speights picked up the slack with 12 points and eight rebounds in 15 minutes. Speights was a key reserve last season with a career high in scoring and is expected to fill the same role this year. UP NEXT: Houston hosts Miami on Saturday.
