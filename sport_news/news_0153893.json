Related Links Area Roundup: Morris soccer falls to Sycamore \nSycamore (13-4-1 overall, 5-0 Northern Illinois Big 12 East) had a goal in both halves. \nForward Matthew Coulibaly started the scoring in the 14th minute when his shot deflected off of Morris’ keeper Matt Borgstrom. \nPhillip Maillefer capped the victory with his goal in the fourth minute of the second half. \nThe Spartans had their share of shots on goal during the game – totaling four in the first half and five in the second – but two goals is all it took to take down Morris, which totaled just three shots. \nThe Spartans have six seniors, and according to head coach David Bachta, they have had an obvious impact. \n“It’s all about the commitment they have shown.” Bachta said. “When you look at the change in the program as far as wins go, that really comes from them. They’ve worked hard all summer and throughout the season and that kind of work ethic rubs off on some of the younger guys.” \nWhile Sycamore reflected on the senior leadership they have, Morris (6-10-0, 0-5) is playing with a thin roster that included just a handful of substitutes and even a few players who moved over at halftime from the junior varsity game on the adjacent field. \n“We were hanging with them in the first half, but our problem all year has been the depth on our roster.” Morris coach David Valdivia said. “We have seven sophomores playing up on varsity right now, so its tough right now, but next year they’re going to be really tough to beat because they’re getting the valuable experience right now.” \nVOLLEYBALL \nMorris 25-25, Geneseo 13-16: Kaylin Korte led Morris (8-13-2) to an NI Big 12 crossover win with 17 kills, five digs, two blocks and an ace. \nJanelle Brehm added four kills, five digs and two aces, while Veronica Johnson had three blocks, one kill and one dig. \nAddison Polite had 15 assists, four digs and one ace, while Ashley Hood had seven assists and three digs. \nMorris won the sophomore match, 20-25, 25-10, 25-18, lost the freshman A match, 27-25, 20-25, 25-17, and won the freshman B match, 25-17, 25-20. \n\nAREA HIGH SCHOOL SPORTS SCHEDULE \nFRIDAY'S EVENTS \n7 p.m. - Coal City at Streator \n7 p.m. - Plainfield East at Minooka \n7 p.m. - Seneca at Westmont \n7:15 p.m. - DeKalb at Morris \nBOYS SOCER \n4:30 p.m. - Newark at Somonauk \nGIRLS TENNIS \n3:30 p.m. - Minooka at Lockport Invitational \nSATURDAY'S EVENTS \n9 a.m. - Morris at Wheaton Academy Warrior Classic \n11 a.m. - Gardner-South Wilmington at Twin Valley Conference meet at Clifton Central \nBOYS GOLF \n8:30 a.m. - Morris, Seneca at LaSalle-Peru Invitational \nGIRLS CROSS COUNTRY \n9 a.m. - Morris at Wheaton Academy Warrior Classic \n11 a.m. - Gardner-South Wilmington at Twin Valley Conference meet at Clifton Central \nGIRLS GOLF \n8 a.m. - Minooka at Rosary Invitational at Bliss Creek \nGIRLS SWIMMING \n10 a.m. - Morris at IMSA Invitational \nGIRLS TENNIS \n8 a.m. - Minooka at Lockport Invitational \nVOLLEYBALL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:01:39.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
