To be able to get back on our own home turf is a huge thing for our guys. They’re excited, and I’m excited to get back in our stadium, play in front of our crowd and try to get a win.”The main reason River Ridge struggled on the road was poor defensive play. The Knights gave up 128 points during the stretch, which bumped their season average of points allowed up to 40.4 per game. Not every defensive problem can be directly blamed on River Ridge, which has been hit hard by injuries, losing both starting defensive ends for the season. “We’re banged-up,” Wynn said. “We have a lot of kids banged-up, but we’re just going to have to play the kids we can play. We’ll have to play the guys who can be there. Jaxson Cromwell is out for the season now, and so is Stephen Omorogbe. Those are two guys we were counting on a lot on defense who are out, but it also gives the opportunity to other guys to step up and make some plays.”Wynn said it will be “replacement by committee,” though he pointed to Tanner Amason, Joseph Irminger, Tate Dill and Chris Cochran as the primary subs. Wynn even went as far as to say he thinks there are some advantages to having so many players play, saying that it gives his defense more looks to give the offense.Those players will have their hands full trying to stop Rome (2-2, 0-1), which averages 30.8 points per game and put up 62 against River Ridge last year. Wynn knows he will not be able to shut down the Wolves’ offense completely, so the key will be to limit big plays.“We know they’re going to get yardage, and we know they’re going to make some plays,” he said. “The biggest thing is to make them continue to stop the football. We really just want to eliminate the big play. We want to make them play everything underneath us and force them to go the distance and execute. We want to make them make a lot of little plays, rather than just one big one.”River Ridge will look to get an offense that was held to 34 points over its last two games going again. Wynn said practice this week was focused on getting back to fundamentals to help establish a more balanced attack.“It comes back to execution,” Wynn said. “We went back to some basic fundamental stuff in practice, just trying to get those fundamentals right and hoping that it will help us with our execution, especially with our run game to open up our passing game. I feel like we can do both, but only if they’re complementing each other.”Regardless of the outcome, either Rome or River Ridge will leave tonight’s game winless in the subregion and in sole possession of last place, but Wynn isn’t ruling anything out just yet.“Any time you’re sitting there with a goose egg in the win column, you just want to get it off,” he said. “Our kids are just ready to get back out there and compete. We know going into it we have a long road carved out for us, but that’s why you don’t play the games on paper. We have to line up and take every snap. We’re just ready to get back out there, compete and see where the cards fall.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:14:30.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
