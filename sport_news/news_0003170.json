Johnson finished with six catches for 77 yards. \nThe Colts (3-2) extended their AFC South winning streak to an NFL-record 16 games. \nBrian Hoyer, who replaced Ryan Mallett for Houston (1-4) in the second quarter, threw a pass up for grabs that was intercepted by Mike Adams with less than 2 minutes left. \nThe 40-year-old Hasselbeck was filling in for Andrew Luck, who missed his second straight game with a shoulder injury. Hasselbeck may not have been 100 percent either, after missing practice Tuesday with an illness. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:52:23.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
