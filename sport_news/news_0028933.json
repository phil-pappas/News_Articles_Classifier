Dickey agreed to a two-year contract extension with the Blue Jays in order to complete his December 2012 trade from the New York Mets, he did so with the belief that he was joining an instant contender — a team with which he could reach the post-season.\n“It’s what I had envisioned happening every year I hoped I was going to be a Blue Jay,” Dickey said Sunday, before the Toronto’s do-or-die game against the Texas Rangers. “But baseball’s funny that way, right? It doesn’t always work out the way you hope. But here we are, and we have an opportunity to do something really neat.”\nThat first season of Dickey’s tenure in Toronto, as Jays fans will recall, was an utter flop. The second year wasn’t much better. But now, three years later, the 40-year-old knuckleballer is finally getting the chance to make his long-awaited post-season debut.\nWell, maybe. The Jays had to win Game 3 on Sunday night first.\nDickey said he isn’t considering the alternative. “I don’t think anybody in there does, you know? Like, in my mind, it’s a certainty.”\nBut later in his news conference he conceded the prospect of missing that chance would be disheartening.\n“I will be very, very disappointed and sad if I don’t get a chance to pitch in the post-season,” he said. “It will really be sad for me but I’ve enjoyed every minute up until this moment.”\nThere was some speculation that Jays’ manager John Gibbons may go to ace lefty David Price on short rest to pitch in a potential Game 4, but Gibbons confirmed Sunday that, if there was a game Monday, Dickey would get his start, with Price available out of the bullpen for any elimination game.\nAcquired to be the ace of that overhyped Jays’ outfit in 2013, Dickey has not lived up to those lofty, and perhaps unreasonable, expectations. The fact the prospects Toronto sent to New York to get him — hard-throwing right-hander Noah Syndergaard and catcher Travis d’Arnaud — figure to be key pieces of the Mets’ long-term future only adds fuel to the fiery angst of the team’s fans.\nBut while Dickey hasn’t repeated his 2012 Cy Young season during his time in Toronto, he has been a stalwart and dependable arm, averaging nearly 220 innings per season, while posting a respectable 3.95 earned-run average.\nIn the second half of this season, in fact, Dickey has been among the American League’s best pitchers. His 2.80 second-half ERA was tied for fourth among AL starters. His second half this year was actually better than in his Cy Young-winning year. Whether or not he gets to start Monday, this season could mark the end of Dickey’s time in Toronto. The Jays hold a $12-million contract option to bring him back, and given how well he has pitched in the second half — and really since the beginning of June — it would be a surprise if they don’t pick it up. But it’s no sure thing.\nThe Nashville native, who was drafted as a conventional pitcher by the Rangers and then reinvented as a knuckleballer in their system, acknowledged the “full circle” symmetry of potentially pitching his first playoff game here, where his career-rejuvenating pitch was born. “It’s poetic, is what it is for me,” he said.\nBut beyond the narrative, Dickey said he expects Arlington’s heat and humidity to have a favourable effect on his notoriously fickle pitch. “I rely on late movement and this place has traditionally been a pretty good place for that.”\nDickey was philosophical about the task facing his club, which entered Sunday needing to win three straight games to keep its season alive.\n“Look, you had to win three games anyway, right? The order in which you’ve won those games is insignificant to winning them,” he said. “We’ve played pretty much the whole month and a half under the yoke of having to win and here we are again having to win. So personally, I think that we’re feeling good in there, everybody’s loose, you don’t see any differences in behaviour. People aren’t meditating in the corners or doing what you might think that they would be doing when the game is on the line. Guys are having fun and we’re enjoying being around each other.”\nMore on thestar.com\nNFL: Bengals, Browns, Falcons win in overtime\nBills rally past Titans in Motor City", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:35:05.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
