I love driving this car and I love where we are at the moment.” \nWith four races to go, Hamilton leads Vettel by 66 points and Rosberg by 73. \nVettel was forced into a prolonged battle with his Ferrari teammate Kimi Raikkonen early on, eventually passing the Finn in a tight move up the inside. \nRaikkonen’s collision with Bottas elevated Perez to third. Raikkonen crossed the line in fifth with heavy damage but was then given a 30-second penalty that dropped him to eighth. \nThat gave Mercedes an unassailable 172-point lead over Ferrari in the constructors’ championship. \nHamilton has 302 points, Vettel is second with 236 and Rosberg has 229. No other driver is in contention. With a maximum of 100 points still available, Hamilton could retain the title at the next race in the United States on October 25.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:44:08.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
