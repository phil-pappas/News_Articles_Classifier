Michael B. Thomas/Getty Images/AFP Article \nFor starters: perspective on the big news \nRemember the 100-yard NFL rusher? Sure you do. Well he made a big comeback on Sunday. \nFor several years he’s been outnumbered by the 300-yard passer, as teams rely ever more on quarterbacks to advance the ball through the air. \nNormally there are more 300-yard passers (300YP) than 100-yard rushers (100YR) in any given week. For instance, over the previous three seasons the average weekly number of 300YP was 7.1, compared to 6.4 100YR. \nNearly half way through this season, the weekly averages are about the same: 7.7 300YP versus 6.7 100YR. \nSince 2012 the odds are only about 70% in any given week that there’ll be more 300YP than 100YR. And when there are more of the latter, it’s usually by a smidge. Such as in Week 4 earlier this month, when there were seven 100YR and only six 300YP. \nNow. Contrast that to a couple of decades ago. In 1995, for instance, there were 5.9 100-yard rushers per week, and only 4.7 300-yard passers. The farther back toward the 1960s you go, the greater the disparity likely grows in the 100YR’s favour. \nThis week, however, it was as though someone turned back the clock. \nExcluding Monday night’s Baltimore-at-Arizona game there were 11 100YR in Week 7 -- the most in almost two years, since Week 9 of 2013. \nWhat’s more, there were only five 300YP. The 11-to-5 disparity in favour of the running backs amounted to the largest reverse differential since Week 14 of 2012, when there were 10 100YR and four 300YP. \nThe Week 7 100YR rollcall: Lamar Miller, Dolphins (175) Le’Veon Bell, Steelers (121) Devonta Freeman, Falcons (116) Charcandrick West, Chiefs (110) \nJust a statistical outlier? Probably. Is the pendulum swinging back? Probably not. \nBut, Week 7’s results -- if nothing else -- do speak to the fact there is a growing number of excellent young backs in the league. And a shrinking number of middling quarterbacks capable of passing for 300 yards without the aid of garbage time. \nWorth keeping an eye on. \nTRENDS NOT COINCIDENCES \nIt happened again, so it will probably happen again \n1. Phil Rivers is throwing the laces off his Wilsons. In San Diego’s past two games he has thrown it 123 times -- most in consecutive games in the NFL since 1950. The Chargers can’t run it, and they can’t stop anyone, so it’s always hurry-up comeback time. Throw, Phil, throw. \n2. Demoted Texans QB Ryan Mallett missed the team flight to Miami on Saturday, citing traffic. This, after sleeping in and missing a practice in the days following his relegation to backup earlier this month. This is a guy who, in January 2007 when he flew up to the University of Michigan out of Texarkana to enrol early, did not bring a coat. \n3. Colts owner Jim Irsay already is bitterly unhappy with head coach Chuck Pagano. After Sunday’s homefield loss to then 2-4 New Orleans, Irsay got into a shouting match with GM Ryan Grigson in Indy’s locker room. Indy has nine games to play. Extrapolate. \nSTAT OF THE WEEK \nInside the numbers \nThis week it’s a slew of stats that all say the same thing about the San Francisco 49ers. You do the math. Reminder, it’s a 32-team league. \nBefore Monday night’s game, the Niners ranked 31st in total yards gained per game, 30th in yards per play, 31st in passing yards per game, 31st in passing yards per play, 32nd in points-per-game differential and 32nd in yards-per-game differential. \nIt’s a wonder they’ve won twice in seven games. \nHERO \nRyan Tannehill, QB, Dolphins. \nGive his due when he excels. Tannehill ended last week’s win against Tennessee with seven straight completions, and began Sunday’s 44-26 destruction of Houston with 18 straight, for 25 in succession -- an NFL record. That broke Donovan McNabb’s over-two-games record of 24, set in 2004. Tannehill also had a perfect passer rating against the Texans (158.6) as the Dolphins won their second in a row since firing Joe Philbin. \nZERO \nGreg Hardy, DE, Cowboys. \nHe earns this ignominious distinction for the second time in three weeks since returning from the commissioner’s banned list (last season) and four-game suspension (to start this season). After Dallas allowed Dwayne Harris to return a kickoff 100 yards for a TD midway through the fourth quarter to break a 20-20 tie against the arch-rival New York Giants, Hardy lost it. Went nuts. He started calling out Cowboys special-teams players, then got into it with special-teams coach Rich Bisaccia, slapping his clipboard or playsheet. \nBisaccia gave it right back to Hardy. Then injured WR Dez Bryant, in street clothes, got involved, barking at Hardy face-to-face to smarten up, shall we say. \nIt worsened the situation when Cowboys owner/GM Jerry Jones not only refused to criticize Hardy, but actually said Hardy earns “respect from all his teammates. That’s the kind of thing that inspires a football team.” \nThen head coach Jason Garrett more or less echoed his boss. Unreal. \nHardy, in keeping in character, answered all post-game questions by continually repeating, with intended annoyance: “No comment. Any other questions?” \nYeah, just one. Do you think your deplorable actions actually help your team? \nSTOCK UP \nTitans defence. \nOnly Denver, the New York Jets and Seattle allow fewer yards per game than Tennessee’s 324. The Titans also have allowed a league-low 56 first downs via the pass, a fantastic average of fewer than 10 per game. Two weeks ago they held Tyrod Taylor and Buffalo to less than 60 total yards deep into the third quarter, and on Sunday held Matt Ryan and Atlanta to 10 points. \nSTOCK DOWN \nBackup quarterbacks. \nWe all know every team is in big trouble if it loses its starter. Hell, half the league is in big trouble WITH its starter. \nBut the combined won-loss record so far of quarterbacks pressed into action, after either the established starter got hurt or the season’s starter stumbled and got yanked, is 6-14 (.300). \nThe roll: Brandon Weeden (0-3) and Matt Cassel (0-1) of Dallas, Michael Vick (2-1) and Landry Jones (0-1) of Pittsburgh, EJ Manuel (0-2) of Buffalo, Johnny Manziel (1-0) of Cleveland, Ryan Mallett (1-3) of Houston, Zach Mettenberger (0-1) of Tennessee, Luke McCown (0-1) of New Orleans and Jimmy Clausen (0-1) of Chicago. \nPLAYOFF PICTURE \nApplying a few more brushstrokes \nHow badly do the Buffalo Bills need this week off? \n“Quite honestly, I don’t know that I’ve ever been on a team that needed a bye week worse than we do,” head coach Rex Ryan said after Buffalo’s 34-31 loss to Jacksonville in London. \n“We’ve got to get some guys back, and not just average football players but pretty darn good ones. And we’ve got to get them back and get healthy and have a heck of a go at it -- nine games.” \nRight. The Bills are 3-4 and, believe it or not, might be only a win in their first game back -- Nov. 8 against visiting Miami -- from returning to the thick of the AFC wild-card playoff race. \nBelieve it. \nIf you presume New England (6-0) wins the East, Cincinnati (6-0) the North, Indianapolis (3-4) the lame South, and Denver (6-0) the West, the only other teams with more than two wins left leading the fight for a pair of AFC wild-card berths are the New York Jets (4-2), Pittsburgh (4-3), Miami (3-3), Oakland (3-3) and Buffalo (3-4). \nAnd three of the four wild-card contenders ahead of Buffalo could lose this week: Pittsburgh faces Cincinnati, Miami plays at New England and New York visits Oakland. \nLots of football left to be played. It’s just the Bills are trending in the wrong direction, having lost three of four. \n“There’s nobody quitting on this team, I’ll tell you that much,” Ryan said. “You’ve got guys that believe in each other, and believe that we’ll get it turned. \n“We expected better results right now. We haven’t got them, quite honestly. I know our fans deserve better than 3-4, there’s no question. But this team needs our fan base to stick by them, and I know they will.” \nACTUAL QUOTE \n“Do you like that?! DO YOU LIKE THAT?!” -- Fired-up Redskins QB Kirk Cousins, pointing and practically screaming to local reporter Tarik El-Bashir of CSNWashington, in the tunnel while hustling to the locker room, after rallying the Redskins from a 24-0 deficit to a 31-30 win over Tampa Bay. Cousins had been taking immense heat from local press. \nACTUAL TWEET \n“My A** should be walking back to New York. How you bounce back after moments like this produce CHAMPIONS or CHUMPS.. . #jets” -- Jets WR Brandon Marshall (@BMarshall), after he blamed himself for New York’s 30-23 loss at New England. He dropped a poorly thrown but catchable ball in the end zone, then committed a false-start penalty that ran 10 seconds off the clock and ended the game. \nQUARTERBACK RANKINGS \nMy Top 20, tweaked after Sunday games (last week’s rankings in brackets) 1.

It did not look good. \nFIVE FAST FACTS \n1. Per ESPN Stats & Info, the Patriots are 4-0 when they throw 80% of the time. All other NFL teams are a combined 3-109. \n2. St. Louis’ Todd Gurley is the first rookie in 10 years to rush for 125+ yards in his first three career starts. \n3. Gurley also has three runs of 45+ yards already. Other NFLers combined have 12. \n4. Yahoo! says 15.2 million viewers web-streamed the Bills-Jaguars game on Sunday morning. \n5. No player since 1960 has had more receptions through seven games than San Diego WR Keenan Allen’s 62, according to Pro-Football-Reference.com. \nKNOW YOUR HISTORY \nTwenty-two years ago this week, the NFL approved a new franchise: the Carolina Panthers. A month later, in November 1993, the league approved a 30th team, the Jacksonville Jaguars. \nTHIS WEEK Quick thoughts on Week 8 games (all on Sunday unless noted) Dolphins at Patriots, Thursday, 8:25 ET: Miami is hot. Could we get a Thursday non-clunker? Please? Lions ‘at’ Chiefs in London, England, 9:30 am ET: Daylight Savings ends. Even more reason to sleep in. Buccaneers at Falcons, 1ET: Matt Ryan and Falcons passing attack should rebound. Chargers at Ravens, 1 ET: Win-desperate teams can’t run or stop the pass. Vikings at Bears, 1 ET: Once again, AP vs. Matt Forte should decide it. Cardinals at Browns, 1 ET: Dawg Pound is getting angry. Need a win. Titans at Texans, 1 ET: Betcha there’s more field goals than touchdowns. Giants at Saints, 1 ET: Don’t write off New Orleans just yet. Bengals at Steelers, 1 ET: If Pittsburgh wants the AFC North, gotta win this. 49ers at Rams, 1 ET: Colin Kaepernick is gonna get pulverized. Jets at Raiders, 4:05 ET: Oakland plays a real defence. Great matchup. Seahawks at Cowboys, 4:25 ET: If the Giants could pick off Matt Cassel three times ... Packers at Broncos, 8:30 ET: Showdown of the year so far. Both are 6-0. Colts at Panthers, Monday, 8:30 ET: Two division leaders. Indy, 3-4. Carolina, 6-0. BYES: Bills, Jaguars, Eagles, Redskins. \nGUARANTEED LOSERS \n2 teams that won’t win this week \nKinda the opposite of a suicide pool. I can pick a team only once all season, so 32 teams over the NFL schedule’s final 16 weeks. Last week’s picks: Oakland (which blew out San Diego) and New York Jets (who lost at New England). This week’s picks: Denver (vs. Green Bay) and Tampa Bay (at Atlanta). \nSeason record: 8-4. \nTAKING A KNEE \nThis week’s winder-upper \nFurther to my weekend feature explaining the impetus and workings of the controversial “complete the catch to the ground” rule, you might have wondered why Carolina WR Ted Ginn Jr.’s apparent catch was ruled an interception by officials, which a replay review upheld. \nThe ball popped out of Ginn’s hands after he hit the ground, and into the hands of Philadelphia CB Nolan Carroll as they slid -- for an interception. \nBut it appeared Ginn got four feet down (well, each foot twice) before Carroll tackled him to the turf. Many think it should have been ruled a catch by Ginn, then down by contact before the fumble. \nDean Blandino, NFL VP of officiating, phoned NFL Network with this explanation. \n“Ginn is going to the ground. Even though Ginn took those (steps), he’s taking them as he’s goes to the ground,” Blandino said. “So remember, he has to hold onto the ball all the way to the ground. He has to land and maintain control. \n“Carroll strips it just after they hit the ground, so (Ginn) didn’t complete the catch. The ball came loose and Carrol intercepted it.” \nTill next week …", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T23:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:58:28.278+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
