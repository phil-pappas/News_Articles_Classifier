His first interception came on the Texans' first drive with Houston driving deep into Colts territory. His second came on Brian Hoyer's ill-advised heave down the field late in the game to preserve Indy's third win in a row. \nAdams is the first Colts player to win AFC Defensive Player of the Week since Jonathan Newsome in Week 17 last season. Adams has been one of Ryan Grigson's shrewdest moves -- signed him to veteran minimum last year, and he's had 10 takeaways in 24 games. â€” Zak Keefer (@zkeefer) October 14, 2015 Read or Share this story: http://indy.st/1LtXfj3 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:19:58.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
