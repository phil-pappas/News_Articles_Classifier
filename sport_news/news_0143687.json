A massive Southeast Portland beer bar pouring 99 taps, all from Oregon (better luck next time, 'Couv) with a tiny kitchen pumping out hot dogs and brats from Portland's premier sausage makers, Olympia Provisions. In practice, the experience is a bit more complicated. Not all 99 beers are always available, what you order off the iPad menu doesn't always match what you're given (that sure is a pale stout!) and the buns wrapping those sausages have a bad habit of disintegrating halfway through. Still, even 75 taps of Oregon beer is impressive, especially with the Loyal Legion mixing crowd pleasers with more obscure brews, including whole sections devoted to on-trend styles including saisons, sours and, on our most recent visit, a seasonals selection devoted to festbiers. Stop by on a Friday or Saturday night, when the bar stools and blue booths at this former Police Athletic Association building are jammed with beer lovers, and you get the sense that The Loyal Legion has already accomplished what it set out to do: Blend a Euro-style beer hall with Oregon craft beer, creating a distinctly Portland bar. Now excuse us while we check in on UnTapped.\nOrder this: A nicely browned frankfurter and a tall glass of Loyal Legion's own beer, a Berlinerweiss made in collaboration with Uptown Brewing.\n710 S.E.
