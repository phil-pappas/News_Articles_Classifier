And – most of all – it was resolute, his confidence unwavering in a 23-2 crew that’s won 12 straight. But really, considering the Indians had just made their 22-4 rival suddenly look pedestrian, could you blame him? The 25-16, 25-22, 25-23 triumph was just that impressive, Choctaw’s big hitters, duo of setters and stout defense in harmony the whole game. “I’m proud of my girls,” said Allen, whose team will host the loser of Washington-Gulf Breeze Wednesday in a Region 1-6A quarterfinal. “We talked about this, about how we felt like we’re the better team right now and we’re kind of hitting our stride. We’re playing together and volleyball is a game of runs. We’ve talked about when the bad run comes, how will we react? All night we reacted positively and it was needed too because Fort Walton Beach is a great team. Them missing Kara probably hurt.” Kara, as in Kara Fisher, a dominant middle hitter sidelined with a left ankle injury. And the Vikings missed her big swings and on the block as Madi Friedman’s 10 kills and four blocks barely made a dent against Choctaw’s net play. “They played well and executed their plan,” said Vikings coach Gigi Vardai, whose team will travel Wednesday to the winner of Washington-Gulf Breeze. “We weren’t able to stop their middles and tried the best we could.” Evelina Teran had 13 kills, though it seemed like 30 considering the celebrations from the 6-2 middle hitter, and Kassandra Fairly delivered nine. “My goal this whole time was to keep myself calm. Namaste. World Peace,” Teran said. “But I felt myself getting more pumped and excited throughout because the adrenaline was flowing.” I just thought, ‘Keep going.’” So what’d you think about Allen’s message in the huddle, Teran? “This means more work,” she said. What about you, Fairly? “I want to win a state title so bad,” said the Daily News reigning Female Athlete of the Year. And you, Krueger? “We’re ready for more,” said the senior. Page 2 of 2 - The confidence stems from depth, the same depth that was showcased in Thursday night’s sweep. Defensively, Lindsey Legg was a rock and Morgahn Fingall a brick wall with four blocks. Meanwhile Alyssa Sehman dished out 22 assists to accent seven kills and Nakia McKinnie followed with 12 assists, spreading the love to Melia Lindner (seven kills) and Krueger (four kills). Of course Krueger’s big hits were timely, back-to-back swings to end the match after a Vikings 3-0 run tied it at 23-all. “I couldn’t believe it because she sided out on the play just before that,” Allen said. “I thought, ‘She’s a senior. This is her year.’ And she executed, she executed when we needed her the most. “She had a great swing to give us match point, and then for the last ball to go to her, I just thought, ‘C’mon, Britney. This is your moment. This is your time. The whole season comes down to this for you.’ And she blasts if off the block and into the antenna. I let out a yell because I was so happy for her.” After coming up short of the playoffs her three previous years, Krueger especially needed this. “I was just thinking, finish the play so we can get our first banner since Meaghan graduated,” Krueger said of Meaghan Allen, her assistant coach and an Indians alumna. “I’ve been working for four years for this.” As for those runs Allen spoke of, the most pivotal came in the second set. After a dominant 25-16 first set in which Fairly had five kills and Sehman six assists, Choctaw trailed 8-2, then later 17-14 and 20-18. Yet the Indians battled back to 22-all and a Sehman kill and Fingall block set up match point. Then a Vikings error off the serve sealed a 2-0 lead that originally should have been the start of Fort Walton Beach’s comeback. From there, the hill was too steep to climb for the Vikings. “Just battling back and staying together,” Allen said of the response. “And we’ve been working on that all year. With a young team, sometimes our emotions get the best of us, but the more we work together and move on to the next play, the better we play.” And for the Indians, it doesn’t get much better than Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:26:31.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
