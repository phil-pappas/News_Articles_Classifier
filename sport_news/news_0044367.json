The ethics committee must now be allowed to do its work in a robust and timely fashion. \n\"With FIFA's crisis deepening, the organisation needs to move beyond interim leadership and elect an accountable president. \n\"Delaying the scheduled election would only postpone needed change and create further instability. It would tell the world that lessons haven't been learned, that the same backroom deals that have discredited FIFA in the first place continue. \n\"Members of the FIFA executive committee should remember that football associations, players, coaches and fans the world over are watching. \n\"The ExCo should not interfere with an ongoing process that was put in place by the ad hoc electoral committee. The election date of February 26 was set three months ago with a clear procedure that meets all of FIFA's statutory requirements. Candidates have had plenty of time to declare and still do. The rules should not be changed after the game has started.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:07:04.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
