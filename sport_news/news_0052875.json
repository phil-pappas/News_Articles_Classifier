Photograph by: Jeff McIntosh , THE CANADIAN PRESS \nHOME OPENER \nThe Canucks beat the Oilers 5-4 in a shootout in last season’s home opener. Chris Higgins, who is missing the start of this season with a foot injury, scored the only shootout goal in that game. The last time the Canucks met the Flames in their home opener was in 2008 when Vancouver won 6-0. The Canucks have opened at home against the Flames five times. Vancouver has won three of those meetings. \nFREE BEER \nYes, free beer. Or a free Pepsi. We know which one we’d choose. All fans attending tonight’s game will receive a complimentary Budweiser, Bud Light Apple, Pepsi or bottled water when they enter Rogers Arena … Tonight’s 50-50 jackpot, which will include unclaimed prizes from last season, is expected to top $200,000 … The Canucks will pay tribute to original anthem singer Richard Loney before the game. \nNO CHANGES \nThe Canucks are not expected to make any lineup changes for tonight’s game. That means Brandon Sutter will once again skate with the Sedins, Bo Horvat will centre Radim Vrbata and Sven Baertschi, rookie Jared McCann will skate between Alex Burrows and Jannik Hansen and Adam Cracknell will play with Derek Dorsett and Brandon Prust. Defensive pairings will have Alex Edler with Chris Tanev, Dan Hamhuis with Matt Bartkowski and Ben Sutton with Luca Sbisa. Ryan Miller starts in goal. \nBACK IN THE SADDLE \nAfter being a healthy scratch in Wednesday’s opener, former Canucks winger Mason Raymond will draw back into the Calgary lineup tonight. “Not a lot changes as far as my preparation,” Mason told Calgary reporters. “You need to go out there and play hockey. Simple as that. Play good hockey. As a group, we’re going in there to get a win — nothing less. I want to be part of that solution.” \nQUOTABLE \n“Call it what you want, we got it (Wednesday). At the same time we have to bounce back … Our GPS ran out of battery. We were all over the place. Our structure went out the door after 10 minutes. We were playing pond hockey.” — Calgary coach Bob Hartley talking about his t", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:04:43.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
