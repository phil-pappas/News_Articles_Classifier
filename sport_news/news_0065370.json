But a few teams will have a say about that the next few weeks. \nThe Bloodhounds play host to fellow TAPPS Division I District 2 unbeaten Austin St. Michael’s at 7 p.m. tonight in an important district game at Canales Field in Brownsville. \nSt. Joseph faces the other unbeaten team in district, San Antonio Central Catholic, next week on the road. \nBut first things first, the Bloodhounds face a tough opponent in the Crusaders. \n“They do it all (on offense), they’re going to be tough to stop,” St. Joseph coach Tino Villarreal said. “Our hope is to slow them down.” \nThe Bloodhounds’ concern is with a pair of athletic St. Michael’s receivers and running back De’Sean Johnson, not to mention a pocket passing quarterback that navigates between the two. \nBut the Crusaders have just as much respect and concern with St. Joseph’s offense. \n“We have to work really hard at shutting down their high-powered offense,” St. Michael’s coach Benjamin Ortiz said. “They’ve been scoring a lot of points. They have some great athletes on that side of the ball. Kai Money does a great job running the offense. We’ve got to play well defensively, and we have the past couple of weeks. We’ve only given up a total of three points. We’re going to have to have another spectacular defensive game to play with these guys.” \nAndrew Crum covers sports for The Brownsville Herald.
