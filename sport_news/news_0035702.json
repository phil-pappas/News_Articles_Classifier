Johnson has had incredible success at Hendrick, NASCAR's top team.\nBut it was achieved through hard work and consistency.\nJohnson is the most dedicated driver in Hendrick's garage and deserves his trophies every year.\nThe title will be won by someone else this season, possibly for the first time by Team Penske's Joey Logano or Joe Gibbs Racing's Kyle Busch.\nIt will go down to the wire, no doubt, under the rules package.\nBut I'm not convinced NASCAR has it right with the Chase format.\nRacing isn't baseball or hockey. Victories don't come in clumps.\nConsider Johnson has four wins this season and is out of the Chase, while Jeff Gordon and Ryan Newman, winless in 2015, are still in contention.\nThe math doesn't add up.\nI'll wager Jimmie feels the same, though he'll likely not complain.\nI think NASCAR still must figure out a fairer way of rewarding postseason competition, or just go back to most points or wins throughout the entire season to crown a champion.\nContact Mike Brudenell: mbrudenell@freepress.com. @mikebrudenell.\nThis weekend's races\nNASCAR Sprint Cup: Bank of America 500\nOn track: At Charlotte Motor Speedway, Concord, N.C.; 30th of 36 races.\nOn TV: 7 tonight on NBC (Channel 4 in Detroit).\nOverview: Kevin Harvick is the defending champ and will be tough to toss again. Expect Carl Edwards, who won at Charlotte in May, to be right there at the finish along with Joey Logano, Kyle Busch and Jimmie Johnson, who has won seven times on the 1.5-mile oval.\nOur picks: 1. Logano, 2. Busch, 3. Johnson.\nNASCAR Xfinity Series: Drive for the Cure 300\nOn track: At Charlotte Motor Speedway; 29th of 34 races.\nOn TV: 8 p.m. today on NBC Sports Network.\nOverview: Bryon's Erik Jones will drive the No. 20 car for Joe Gibbs Racing, while Cup regulars Kyle Busch, Kasey Kahne, Brad Keselowski and Austin Dillon will make starts.\nOur picks: 1. Busch; 2. Keselowski; 3. Kahne.\nFormula One: Russian Grand Prix\nOn track: At Sochi Autodrom, Sochi, Russia; 15th of 19 races.\nOn TV: 7 a.m. Sunday on NBC Sports Network.\nOverview: Lewis Hamilton won in Russia last year and is dominating the 2015 season. But Nico Rosberg could rally to beat his Mercedes teammate.\nOur picks: 1. Rosberg, 2. Hamilton, 3.
