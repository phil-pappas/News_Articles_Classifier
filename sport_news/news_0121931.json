Chengelis , The Detroit News 3:30 p.m. EDT October 13, 2015 Roy Roundtree CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThis is the third in a series of profiles on former Michigan players and their thoughts on the Michigan State game. \nFormer Michigan receiver Roy Roundtree didn't feel comfortable wearing green, but that's what the demonstration team players had to do during Michigan State week. \nRoundtree, now coaching receivers at Colorado State-Pueblo and several years removed from his 2009 freshman season, still bristles at the thought of wearing that color. \n\"I was one of those scout team guys freshman year with green tape on my helmet and not being able to talk to the guys until after practice,\" Roundtree said. \"It was rivalry week, and the main thing was the preparation and getting the guys mentally focused.\" \nThe scout team players wearing green were treated differently during the week, as though they actually were the team they were trying to replicate. \n\"You've got your side you're on, you stretched in different lines away from the team,\" Roundtree said. \"Coach wanted to have that mindset going. Every day we'd see a different clip of highlights from different games, so you look back at (the rivalry) and you learn so much. And then having to wear green and the green helmets, it was like, 'C'mon, man.' You struggle with that for a week.\" Jansen: Michigan State is 'always a rivalry' \nRoundtree grew up in Dayton, Ohio, and two of his close friends, running back Javon Ringer and defensive tackle Jerel Worthy, went to Michigan State. \n\"We would talk trash throughout the whole week,\" Roundtree said, noting they still maintain a group text on their cell phones and continue to chatter away about Saturday's Michigan-Michigan State game. \"We knew what that game meant for us.\" \nMichigan lost three straight while Roundtree was there, until 2012 at Michigan Stadium. Michigan State has won six of the last seven games in the series, with that 12-10 outcome in favor of Michigan as the lone loss. \nIt was his senior season and Brady Hoke was in his second season of coaching Michigan. And the Wolverines were thrilled to have the Paul Bunyan Trophy back. \n\"You go in expecting it's going to go down to the wire, and we stuck it out,\" Roundtree said. \"The excitement we had ... I was the first one in the locker room to see him (Paul Bunyan), because I hadn't seen him since freshman year. I made sure I got my hug from Paul. I told him I missed him. We got it finally and (long-time equipment manager) Jon Falk made sure it was in the middle of the locker room. \n\"After we won, we got to walk into Schemy (Schembechler Hall) every day and there's not an empty spot there -- it's actually Paul. It's bragging rights. I always tell my boys (Ringer and Worthy), 'The last time you played at Michigan, who won?' And they say, 'Y'all won on a field goal,' but I tell them, 'We still won.'\" \nRoundtree's receivers at Colorado State-Pueblo didn't put two-and-two together until former Michigan receivers coach Jeff Hecklinski, now on the staff with the ThunderWolves, pointed out Roundtree's well-known catch against Notre Dame in the night game at Michigan Stadium. \nHe has never been one to brag about himself, which always makes the thought of hearing Roundtree trash-talking hard to grasp. But he's very much into this week as the Wolverines prepare to face the unbeaten Spartans. Roundtree has been giving Ringer and Worthy a hard time. \nRoy Roundtree's most memorable Michigan catch was the one that defeated Notre Dame in 2011. (Photo: John T. Greilick, Detroit News) \n\"It's been quiet from them,\" Roundtree said, laughing. \"When my team is not doing well, you hear from them a lot. I have to be that guy. I tell them, 'Y'all see my team, 38-0? Y'all still doubting?' I had to hear from them these last two years straight. This is still my team. Win, lose or draw, I bleed blue. \n\"They're mentally ready. The last two years they were at Michigan State and now they're home and they can have the home crowd on their side. It will be a different environment, College GameDay is going to be there, and it gets no better. I know these guys are excited.\" \nRoundtree knows from personal experience through four meetings that Michigan State is the most physical game the Wolverines will play this season. Jourdan Lewis doing 'spectacular things' for Michigan \n\"Michigan State, that's a physical game,\" he said. \"This is going to test where our guys are. We always said this game right here is going to show us where we're at as a team. Michigan State is the most physical team in the Big Ten. We have to match that intensity, which I know they will. These guys are locked in and it shows, and I'm loving it.\" \nThe ThunderWolves, coming off a national championship last season, are ranked No. 5 nationally in Division II and are 5-1. They play at South Dakota on Saturday, so Roundtree will have to miss watching most of the Michigan-Michigan State game, although he plans to catch the end of it on his phone. \nHe feels as focused on this game as the current Wolverines. And while a 1-3 career record against MSU isn't something he likes to remember, he hangs onto the fact he was part of the last team that beat the Spartans in 2012. \n\"Yeah, (that record) hurt, but I got me one,\" Roundtree said, laughing. \"Something I could take with me to the bank.\" \nRoy Roundtree against MSU", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:47:02.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
