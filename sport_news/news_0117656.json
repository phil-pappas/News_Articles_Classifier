Chris Kreider’s calm on Saturday afternoon was reassuring, after Alain Vigneault’s brief but intense Greenburgh practice revealed rampant lineup changes and an impatient urgency heading into Sunday afternoon’s Garden visit from the New Jersey Devils.\nKreider sat at his locker and said that despite not scoring a goal through five games, he feels he’s “working in the right direction,” and he considers a simple football analogy to describe the adjustment he must make to maximize his impact.\n“I don’t want to be a one-trick pony. I want the puck, and I want to be a bully,” he said. “I have to be less Randy Moss, more LeGarrette Blount.”\nThe product of Boxford, Mass., and Boston College was evoking names of New England Patriots players current and past to explain how he must attack a defense, like that of the winless Devils (0-3-1), who will cross the Hudson River for Sunday’s 1 p.m. matinee start.\nKreider, 24, often tries to stretch defenses, taking off down his left wing looking for a long pass, like Moss once did looking for Tom Brady fly patterns, or weaving across the neutral zone. But what he must concentrate on is supporting the puck closer to his own zone, making himself available to teammates for an outlet, getting the puck and – like the Patriots’ bruising back Blount – using his strength to play “heavy”.\n“I’m happy with the steps I took in the Montreal game,” Kreider said of his five-on-five play in Thursday night’s 3-0 road loss to the Canadiens. “It’s actually the best I’ve felt all year, so I think I’m working in right direction … The first two games, though, I was going too much East-West, bad habits, coming across rather than taking on my ‘D.’”\nExpectations for Kreider are higher than they’ve ever been. He’s encouraged that, while bad games will happen, he believes he’s quicker to recognize when there is “a lack of impact” on his part to address.\n“I can feel that now, when it’s getting away from me,” Kreider said. “And I intend for those games to be fewer and farther between this season.”\nHe recognized during Tuesday night’s 4-1 home loss to the Winnipeg Jets, for example, that “I didn’t exact any physical play in that Winnipeg game, which is exactly what I needed to do against that team.” He said he needs to “slow myself down” and “work smart” and not just hard.\nHoward Simmons/New York Daily News Kreider (l.) looks to set a more physical tone for the Blueshirts. Sunday, the left-handed shooting Kreider will be on a new line with left-handed center Derick Brassard and right wing Jesper Fast, a different look from Kreider’s typical linemates – right-handed center Derek Stepan and left-handed wing Rick Nash or Kevin Hayes. But it only changes areas of the ice where he might expect pass; it doesn’t alter what he must improve.\n“That’s stuff I should do regardless of who I’m playing with,” he said.\nTo say Vigneault is not pleased with his team is an understatement. He’s giving Henrik Lundqvist a sixth straight start on Sunday, which the coach claims was his original plan, but he’d hinted backup Antti Raanta would make a start soo, and Sunday made more sense than Monday’s visit from undefeated San Jose (4-0-0).\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE\nNash is skating with Stepan and Mats Zuccarello. Kevin Hayes is back at third-line center with Oscar Lindberg and J.T. Miller on the wings. Veteran forward Jarret Stoll is replacing Emerson Etem on the fourth line, and Viktor Stalberg seemingly could be a healthy scratch for the first time.\nEven the defensive pairs are wildly different: Ryan McDonagh is with Kevin Klein, Marc Staal is alongside Dan Boyle and Dan Girardi has been bumped to a pair with Keith Yandle.\n“We haven’t been consistent with our play through a game, even the games we’ve won,” McDonagh, the captain, said after practice. “In the grand scheme we have to be able to put 60 minutes together well. We have to find that fast, and the (coaches) are obviously shaking up the lines and ‘D’ pairs trying to find that stability.”\nRelated Stories Rick Nash headlines group of Rangers in goal-scoring slumps Rangers blanked by Carey Price, Canadiens in 3-0 loss Jarret Stoll a healthy scratch for Rangers vs. Canadiens Tags: chris kreider , new jersey devils", "external_links": ["http://facebook.com/nydnsports"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:12:46.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
