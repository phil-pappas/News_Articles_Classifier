There is no rate hike specifically associated with this speed increase, but Comcast raised its cable TV pricing at the start of October .\nComcast's rate structure is extremely complex and the company says it has no standard pricing for customers who subscribe to bundles of services.\nInternet-only subscribers are not getting Comcast's faster speeds but will pay higher rates – unless they're already under a contract with a fixed price. The new prices are $3 more a month for 50 Mbps customers (new price: $70), and an additional $4 a month (new price: $84) for 105 Mbps subscribers.\nNew, Internet-only subscribers do have access to the higher speeds. They will pay $75 a month for the 75 Mbps service, or $90 for 150 Mbps.\nCurrent subscribers will need to reset their modems – typically by unplugging them – to get the faster speeds.\nComcast doubled Internet speeds on its most popular plans last November . Families are placing increasing demands on their home networks as they stream more video from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon and a host of emerging services.\nInternet service providers are also engaged in a marketing war to offer the fastest connections – even if they're much faster than most subscribers need.\nCenturyLink and Frontier have each begun offering hyperfast gigabit Internet connections in parts of the Portland area. A gigabit is 1,000 Mbps. Google Fiber is preparing to launch its gigabit service in Portland, and Comcast promises a 2-gigabit, $300 a month option to some Oregon customers by the end of the year.\nAs Comcast ramps up speeds it's also experimenting with charging heavy users extra.\nThe widely watched industry site DSLReports writes that in some markets -- though not Portland -- Comcast is experimenting with plans that charge customers extra if they use more than 300 gigabytes of data a month. Those that go above that ceiling would pay an additional $10 a month for each additional 50 GB of data beyond that, or $30 extra to avoid any cap on their use.\nThat's plenty for nearly everyone -- in 2012, CNET reported only 1 percent of U.S. broadband households exceeded 300 GB a month . Soaring demand for video streaming services have surely pushed that number up.\nAnd in time, a growing share of the population that wants more and more from its Internet service could bump up against those usage limits, triggering higher costs.\nComcast has 600,000 subscribers in Oregon and Southwest Washington, and the company says it has no plans right now to make changes to its usage caps in this market.\nUpdate: This article has been updated to clarify that the CNET report is from 2012.\n-- Mike Rogoway\nmrogoway@oregonian.com\n503-294-7699\n@rogoway", "external_links": ["http://www.cnet.com/news/verizons-and-comcasts-data-caps-who-wins-and-who-loses/", "http://www.dslreports.com/shownews/As-Florida-Caps-Go-Live-Comcast-Still-Refuses-to-Admit-They-Cap-135270", "https://twitter.com/rogoway"], "published": "2015-10-09T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:03:29.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
