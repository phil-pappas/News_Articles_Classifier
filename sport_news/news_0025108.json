C-USA Football Players of the Week are voted on by a panel of the league’s media. Brauchle collected a career-best four field goals – the most by a Golden Eagle since Corey Acosta kicked four against Alabama last season – including a career-long 39 yarder. He also added two extra points to account for 14 of the Golden Eagles’ 32 points in the contest. Brauchle also handled kickoffs, in which he booted seven for a 59.4-yard average. This was the first-ever weekly honor for Brauchle and first special teams award for the Golden Eagles since Corey Acosta collected the award on Oct. 20, 2014. Southern Miss has now won three weekly awards this season, the most since the 2011 team captured eight player of the week nods. Old Dominion won both the offensive and defensive weekly awards, as junior WR Zach Pascal posted career-highs with 11 receptions for 231 yards and three touchdowns and junior LB T.J. Ricks tallied 18 tackles, a sack, forced fumble and a fumble recovery, respectively, in a 37-34 home victory over Charlotte. The Golden Eagles return to action this Saturday, when they travel to face C-USA newcomer Charlotte. Game time is set for 11 a.m., CT.
