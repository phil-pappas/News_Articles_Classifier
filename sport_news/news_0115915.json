Comment Follow @@kyleR_sports Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 9:00 AM Ascension Parish lost one of its most beloved figures in prep sports over the weekend with the passing of Kevin Shillings. Shillings, 57, died after briefly battling an illness. He had planned on working the St. Amant vs. McKinley football game last Friday night, but he missed it after falling ill. On Saturday night, he was rushed to the hospital after suffering through seizures. He never recovered. Shillings had fought through melanoma years prior. He was an East Ascension alum and had covered Ascension high-school sports for SportsNOLA.com . He was also a staple on Eatel 4 telecasts of St. Amant football games. He even hosted his own cable show that highlighted the parish's prep sports. Overall, he had been broadcasting games for 30 years. Shillings became St. Amant High School's greatest source for sports information. Whether it was football, basketball, baseball or softball, it was almost a guarantee that he would be seen in the press box covering the games. He was even known to do pre-game introductions for Gator basketball games from time to time. He was a mainstay on Twitter as he continuously put out updates throughout the parish--becoming Ascension's go-to guy for high-school athletics. Shillings was well-known and well-loved throughout the community. He'll always be remembered for his flowing white beard, booming voice, wonderful sense of humor, passion for parish sports and his unrivaled love for Houston Astros baseball. It was a special time for Shillings to see his Astros' amazing resurgence in 2015 as they made a return to the postseason. As Houston plays on and as St. Amant and East Ascension continue their fierce rivalry on Friday night, Shillings will be on the minds of many throughout the parish. Shillings leaves behind his wife, Becky, along with his children, Alex and Kam.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:17:17.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
