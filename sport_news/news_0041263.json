Yeldon.\nMORE: NFL Week 5 photos | Kuechly cleared, out of concussion protocol\n“When I was playing, sometimes you wonder, ‘Do I know I have one?’ Kuechly said. “I knew I had one.\n“I definitely knew, and that’s when it was like, I knew there was something wrong. I tried to get up, I tried to shake it off, and I knew that there was something that was wrong.”\nKuechly, one of the most high-profile linebackers in the league, had suffered one of its most notorious injuries. It left him with only one option to return to the field, one that caused him great strain during the past three weeks.\nHe had to let the concussion heal on its own.\nKuechly wouldn’t say it, but Carolina coach Ron Rivera could see it annoyed his linebacker.\nKuechly — a man who has made a lucrative career of flying all over the field — was anxious to get back on the field, and disliked having his return delayed by his inability to simply get over the first known concussion of his playing career.\n“There were times when you could tell it was frustrating because he wanted to be back out there,” Rivera said. “He really tried to push himself, and that’s just the way he is, he just wanted to be back out there.”\nKuechly, ever the competitor, at first hoped to remedy the symptoms associated with his concussion as quickly as possible.\nFor weeks, his memory and reaction time were tested by team doctors. They’d give him words to remember, test him for several minutes on completely different subjects, and ask him to recall the words given to him prior to testing.\nIt was a far cry from the training typically expected of an All-Pro linebacker.\nEven while undergoing the NFL’s concussion protocol, he sat through team meetings, unless it became apparent he was pushing himself too rigorously.\n“There was one instance one week where he might have been pushing himself too hard, and (we) basically banned him from meetings for a while,” Rivera said. “He had to take a couple of days where he missed meetings.”\nMORE: Josh Norman offers gummy bears to bribe doctor for Kuechly's return | Luke Kuechly becomes NFL's hightest-paid linebacker\nAfter one week, it became apparent to Kuechly his concussion would take time to subside completely. Throughout his testing, he was given the same advice, over and over.\n“The advice I got from the doctor was, ‘Be smart, and let it go on.’ Kind of like, you can’t tough it out, you can’t tape it up, you can’t say, ‘OK, I’m good,’” Kuechly said. \"Just, let it get better. You can’t be stubborn with it and let it get better.”\nThat, of course, didn’t make it any easier watching his team work for a 4-0 record without him.\nHe missed the practice, he missed the camaraderie, he missed the post-practice goofing off. While his teammates went along, business as usual, he drew shapes, hoping each test would bring a positive prognosis with it.\nIt was admittedly difficult for Kuechly, though he understood the importance of caution. It was a sentiment shared by Rivera as well.\nThroughout the past three weeks, the Carolina coach removed himself nearly completely from Kuechly’s protocol. Kuechly would come back when he was ready, not because he felt pressured by his coach.\n“I never sought any information from anybody,” Rivera said. “I didn’t want to seem like I was anxious. That would have been unfair to a lot of people, especially Luke.”\nIn time — an unbearably long time in Kuechly’s eyes — he was cleared of his concussion, just in time for the Panthers’ Week 6 matchup against the Seahawks.\nThough Kuechly says he feels great, we won't see until Sunday whether that translates to being football-ready. Rivera said the team may let Kuechly into the game in limited snaps depending on practice this week, though nothing is a given.\nRegardless, Kuechly is at least happy for the opportunity.\n“You want to feel like you’re doing something again,” Kuechly said. “I was able to do what I was supposed to do, but it’s just different being out there and running around.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-09-10/luke-kuechly-panthers-agree-on-5-year-contract-extension", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4657643-nfl-week-5-photos-pictures-colts-texans-arian-foster-adam-vinatiera-mike-adams-football", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-10-08/josh-norman-gummy-bears-bribe-luke-kuechly-return-concussion-doctor-panthers", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-09-13/luke-kuechly-return-update-concussion-injury-panthers-linebacker", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-10-13/luke-kuechly-cleared-concussion-status-update-panthers-seahawks", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:24:46.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
