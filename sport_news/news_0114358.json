Jirschele’s alert decision to send Lorenzo Cain home from first base on Eric Hosmer ’s long single into the rightfield corner in the bottom of the eighth inning paid off, providing the difference maker in the Royals’ pennant-clinching 4–3 win over the Blue Jays in Game 6 of the ALCS.\n“I’ve been seeing it this whole series with [Blue Jays rightfielder Jose] Bautista, on a ball hit like that, he’s not really paying attention to the runner coming into third, he just comes up and throws the ball into second—firm to second,” said Jirschele. “I knew if we had speed coming into third base that we could go ahead and take a chance.”\nMLB Video Royals top Blue Jays in ALCS Game 6 to reach second straight World Series by Cliff Corcoran", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/jay_jaffe"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:35:06.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
