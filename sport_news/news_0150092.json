I just looked down and my sport coat was smoldering. They’re ripping it off me as (Indiana) takes the ball into the end zone. I called the play and nobody ever knew what happened. They literally ripped my coat off me, threw it on the ground, and started stomping on it.”\nIndiana tied the score, but this being Indiana football, the Hoosiers went on to lose 27-21 when Michigan receiver Anthony Carter caught a 45-yard touchdown pass on the game’s final play.\nLee Corso was the Indiana coach that day 36 years ago, and he also was the coach who once paused during a game against Ohio State to have his photograph taken with the scoreboard behind him showing the Hoosiers leading the Buckeyes.\nSo it goes for football at basketball-mad Indiana, home to a grand total of two Big Ten football championships, in 1945 and ’67. The second title sent the Hoosiers to their lone Rose Bowl. They have been in just eight other bowls, one (the 2007 Insight Bowl) since 1993.\nKevin Wilson is in his fifth season as coach at Indiana, which first played football in 1887. His 12 predecessors since 1947 all left with losing records. So Wilson’s 18-34 mark seems appropriate.\nWilson, however, has the Hoosiers 4-0 for only the sixth time in their history and first time since 1990. Their five-game winning streak, dating to last season, is Indiana’s longest in 28 years.\nIf the Hoosiers, 22-point underdogs, win on Saturday, they would be off to their best start since that magical season of 1967 and fire extinguishers might be needed.\n“The confidence level in the program is good as far as the players and the coaches,” Fischer said. “I think our fans are really excited that we’re 4-0, but I don’t think our fans are unrealistic in believing Indiana has a great, great shot at winning this football game.”\nHistory dulls optimism in Bloomington. Ohio State hasn’t lost to Indiana since 1988, and the Buckeyes have a 70-12-5 record in the series, with 19 consecutive victories. The Hoosiers are 0-15 against top-ranked teams, including 0-5 against OSU.\n“Hopefully we can at least make it competitive,” said Gregg “Rags” Rago, owner and manager of Nick’s English Hut, a landmark tavern near the Indiana campus. “If for some miraculous chance that we win, that would be great for IU football and another dark day for Ohio State football. Didn’t Earle Cooper say that?”\nEarle Cooper? Oh, Earle Bruce. Yes, Bruce was Ohio State’s coach in 1987 when the Buckeyes lost to Indiana for the first time in 36 years.\n“This has got to be the darkest day for Ohio State football since I’ve been associated with it,” Bruce said after that 31-10 loss at Ohio Stadium.\nDark Day II came a year later under OSU coach John Cooper, when the Hoosiers won 41-7 in Bloomington. That was the apex for Bill Mallory, Indiana’s career leader in victories. He went 69-77-3 and took IU to six bowls from 1984 to ’96.\nIndiana’s program has since been in the dark. The Hoosiers haven’t been ranked since being No. 25 in September 1994. They are 35-133 in Big Ten games since their last winning record in league play in ’93. They are 30-58 overall since 2007.\n“Our fans want to have success,” Fischer said, “but they don’t experience it enough to believe it’s actually going to happen. That’s the issue: Can this team get over the hump?”\nIf the Hoosiers do so Saturday with a monumental victory, Fischer’s coat won’t catch on fire. He quit cigarettes long ago.\nAs for Nick’s English Hut, well, it could get a little hot inside that 88-year-old establishment if Indiana defeats the Buckeyes.\n“I don’t expect it to happen,” Rago said. “Don’t get me wrong. I’d really like for it to happen, but it probably won’t. But if it does, this place will go insane.”\ntjones@dispatch.com \n@Todd_Jones", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:39:08.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
