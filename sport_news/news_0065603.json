He's still the same Sheldon Richardson.\nThe now-reinstated Pro Bowler had a message for his teammates along the defensive line, who were plenty productive during his four-game suspension.\n“I’m coming to eat, too,” he said Monday.\nRichardson participated in his first regular-season practice of 2015 on Monday and will play on Sunday against Washington. That ought to be a scary proposition for Kirk Cousins, as Gang Green’s existing defensive line of Muhammad Wilkerson, Damon Harrison and Leonard Williams was already pretty feisty.\nSo what does Richardson, who had eight sacks and made it to the Pro Bowl last year, think of his addition into the mix?\n“No breaks for quarterbacks,” he said.\nTodd Bowles said he’ll ease the defensive lineman back into action. “We’ve got to get him in shape first. Get him in shape, let him run around, get his wind and his football legs under him,” Bowles said. “You’ve got to make sure you keep him fresh and try to protect him from himself.”\nThough the Jets have four starting-caliber linemen for three starting spots, Bowles has indicated they will all get their share of playing time.\nDespite the potential for greatness, defensive line coach Pepper Johnson was cautious about heaping praise on the group. “I want them to prove it,” he said.\nDuring his four-game suspension for a failed marijuana test, Richardson was allowed to be in the building for meetings, but wasn’t able to participate in practice.\nHe worked out on his own during practice, and would run through positional drills on a daily basis. On game days he would go home and watch the Jets on TV with his family.\n“Watching football ain’t my thing,” Richardson said. “It’s been real difficult. But you know, brought it on myself.”\nThe four-week suspension was the longest in-season absence from football that Richardson has ever had, he said.\n“Yeah, it’s strange,” he said. “It was something mentally I had to deal with, going from team MVP to not playing. So, it was a lot. Pro Bowl season to not playing, it was a lot to deal with. Down on myself, but I’m alright now.”\n“I think he learned a lot,” Bowles said. “Something like that really humbles you, I’m sure.”\nAsked if he still needs to repair trust with the organization, Richardson said, “I’m going to be myself. Happy-go-lucky guy, man, and dominate on the football field.”\nThe four games missed for the marijuana test likely won’t be the last suspension Richardson serves. The defensive lineman was charged with resisting arrest and multiple traffic violations stemming from a July 14 incident in which police said he was driving 143 mph. That matter has not been resolved in court.\nAsked if he was concerned, while waiting to be reinstated, about another suspension, Richardson indicated he figured the league would wait until the legal process played out. Richardson’s latest hearing, scheduled for last week, was pushed back to another date in about a month.\n“I was just pretty much worried about my court date (and) stuff. My court issues,” he said. “And then I knew a judgment was going to come after that, so when that got postponed, I kind of figured I was going to be in for this season. But it could be tacked on next year, too.”\nRelated Stories Mehta: Jets' Richardson could be rewarded for good behavior", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T07:14:33.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
