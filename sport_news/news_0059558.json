(AP) — The Jacksonville Jaguars have placed kick returner Corey Grant and receiver Tony Washington on injured reserve. \nThe team also promoted receiver Neal Sterling from the practice squad Tuesday. \nGrant tore a hip flexor in a loss to Houston on Sunday, and Washington severely strained a hip flexor. \nThe Jaguars (1-5) also released defensive tackle Ziggy Hood from the injured list after he passed a physical and released quarterback Jeff Tuel from the practice squad. Jacksonville signed rookie receiver Rasheed Bailey and safety Craig Loston to the practice squad. \nThe 6-foot-4 Sterling, a seventh-round pick by Jacksonville, could see playing time Sunday against Buffalo in London. Receiver Marqise Lee is likely to miss another game with a hamstring injury, and receiver Allen Robinson is dealing with a bruised lower leg. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:26:25.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
