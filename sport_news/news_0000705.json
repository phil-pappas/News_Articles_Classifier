Image 35 of 35 St. Joseph girls soccer fends off Westhill, 4-3 1 / 35 Back to Gallery \nSTAMFORD — The FCIAC girls soccer playoffs should be this entertaining. \nThe St. Joseph High school girls soccer team kept its crusade for an undefeated season percolating Wednesday, earning a hard-fought 4-3 road triumph over Westhill. \nSt. Joseph’s record improved to 9-0 overall and 9-0 in the FCIAC. St. Joseph posted the victory despite missing reigning Hearst Connecticut Media Girls Soccer MVP Jenna Bike, who is spending a week with the United States Girls Soccer National Team . \n“It was a quality win against a quality opponent,” St. Joseph veteran coach Jack Nogueira said. “Jenna (Bike) should be finished with the National Team by Saturday. Westhill is such a dangerous team and they defended us well. I’m happy we won but allowing them three goals gives us something to work on.” \nIt was a soccer game disguised as a track meet as both offenses kept the goalies — St. Joseph sophomore Veronica O’Rourke (10 saves) and Westhill junior Emily Pritchard (17 saves) — incredibly busy on the sunny afternoon. \nSt. Joseph scored first when Lindsey Savko netted the first of her two goals off a set piece pass from Marissa Grasso with 24:57 left in the first half. \nWesthill (7-3, 7-3) answered when Cassie Herrera headed in a free kick by Francesca McDonald with 18:55 left in the first half for 1-1. \nThen Westhill’s dynamic forward Chelsea Domond tallied on a breathtaking solo run with 17:15 to go for 2-1. \nOne of St. Joseph’s top defenders — sophomore Maia Moscova — was on the sideline for both goals after getting hit in the face with the ball from point blank range with 21:23 left before intermission. Moscova returned after being checked by the trainer with 13:12 left before halftime. \nSt. Joseph forged a 2-2 intermission tie when Leah Lewis headed in another superb free kick by Grasso 8:43 before halftime. \nSt. Joseph’s offense became more determined and possession-oriented in the second half. \nWesthill’s defense — junior sweeper Natalie Druehl, sophomore Casey Watson , McDonald, Herrera and Erica Shaulsen — bent and finally broke with 20:38 left to play. \nJessica Mazo gave the Cadets a 3-2 edge, tallying on a quick counter attack off a pass from Sophia Smith . \nSavko scored her second goal with 4:34 remaining for 4-2, taking advantage of Westhill playing up in search of a tying goal. \nSt. Joseph’s defensive philosophy against Domond was to have seemingly the entire roster blanket her every move. \nStill Domond broke free of the seemingly endless stream of defenders and double teams, scoring with 4:09 left for 4-3. \nThe final minutes were frenzied, but Westhill was never able to generate a solid scoring chance that could have netted the equalizer. \n“Chelsea Domond was tremendous. This week has been like a double-edged sword playing without Jenna Bike,” Nogueira said. “To win without Jenna builds everybody’s confidence. That’s very good for us in the big picture. We’ve been a young team the last two seasons. Right now, we’re healthy — knock on wood. And the girls are in a great place. But it doesn’t get easier for us as we face Ridgefield Friday.” \nWhile the loss hurt, Westhill coach Dave Flower found many silver linings to take from the battle. \n“I feel we don’t lose anything from losing this game. We saw the level we had to play at against a team like St. Joseph and the girls did,” Flower said. “Considering the quality of the St. Joseph forwards, our defense played well. The experience our youngsters gained from this matchup is invaluable to them as we move ahead. We can be young and inconsistent. But this game sends a message to the rest of the FCIAC that when we play well we’re very dangerous.” \nST. JOSEPH 4, WESTHILL 3 \nST.
