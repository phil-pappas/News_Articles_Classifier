That's according to a transcript of the interview released Wednesday by SiriusXM. The interview airs Friday. \nDemocrats say Bush's support of the nickname is \"extremely insulting to Native American people.\" \nBush said the same issue arose with the Florida State University nickname, the Seminoles, when he was Florida governor. He said the tribe came to the defense of the university and the controversy subsided. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:49:47.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
