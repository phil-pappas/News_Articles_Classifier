The city will host the world’s first 24 hour tennis marathon on November 13 and 14. Different teams representing corporate companies from the UAE, comprising of local and international players will compete against each other during the day-night-day event, which is supported by the Dubai Sports Council. Players will get the opportunity to meet and play with and against the 2013 Wimbledon Champion Marion Bartoli. The marathon will begin at 1pm on November 13 at the tennis courts of Grand Hyatt Hotel in Dubai after an opening ceremony and gala dinner and will conclude at 1pm on November 14. A family breakfast, free tennis clinics and interactive games for adults and children are lined-up on the final day. Vipin Sharma, MD, Veracity World, said: “The event not only comes as a platform for local players to showcase their tennis playing skills, but would also act as an ideal fun family outing. This event would be an annual event starting this year.” Strath Sherriff, MD of SISM, said: “Dubai has already made its mark as an important destination in the annual ATP and WTA calendar with the annual ATP and WTA event in Dubai attracting most of the top 10 ranked players amongst both men and women. Our attempt at the 24 Hour Marathon would further elevate Dubai and UAE’s position as the tennis hub in the region.” The marathon is organised by Sherriff International Sports Management.
