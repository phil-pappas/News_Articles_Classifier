So do we, identifying five players deserving of game balls following each Alabama game.\nHere are the picks after the Tide's 38-10 win over Georgia on Saturday (listed alphabetically):\nSenior cornerback/punt returner Cyrus Jones\nArkansas quarterback Brandon Allen was just 14 of 31 for 122 yards with one touchdown and one interception aside from a late 54-yard touchdown on Alabama redshirt freshman cornerback Marlon Humphrey.\nMost of Allen's modest passing yardage total (176 yards) was gained on completions of 15, 21, 18, 21, 18 and 54 yards. None of those completions came on Jones.\nJones helped the Tide limit Razorbacks top receiver Drew Morgan to 15 yards on four catches after he posted a combined 13 catches for 265 yards in games against Texas A&M and Tennessee.\nJones also had a late 27-yard punt return. He had an early long return negated by a penalty.\nJunior safety Eddie Jackson\nJackson had three tackles and an interception during the fourth quarter that he returned 20 yards to Arkansas' 13-yard line.\nThat set up a field goal that pushed the Tide's lead to 20-7.\nSenior inside linebacker Reggie Ragland\nRagland had a team-high eight tackles, a stop for a loss, a sack, a forced fumble, a pass breakup and two quarterback hurries.\nHe helped Alabama limit Arkansas to 220 yards and standout running back Alex Collins to 26 yards on 12 carries.\nFreshman wide receiver Calvin Ridley\nRidley had a career-high nine catches for a career-best 140 yards and a touchdown.\nWith the Tide trailing 7-3 late in the third quarter, Ridley caught an 81-yard momentum-changing touchdown from quarterback Jake Coker.\nJunior defensive lineman A'Shawn Robinson\nRobinson had five tackles and a quarterback hurry.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:00:16.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
