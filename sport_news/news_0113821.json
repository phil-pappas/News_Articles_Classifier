Hansen would play just 3:11 in a 5-2 win. \n“He was great at motivating,” added Hansen. “Very charismatic. He wanted to win above all, so you can’t question his motives and passion. Could I have done without some of the stuff? Of course. Obviously, we had a tough year and it was the first where we really had a lot of injuries (six by the Olympic break and a seven-game losing streak), and any time the (Sedin) twins go down, you’re in a lot of trouble and we missed the playoffs. \nAlex Burrows suffered a foot fracture at the outset of the short Tortorella reign and it’s customary for an injured player to be somewhat of an outcast and have little inter-action with the coach. For the talkative winger, that’s a lot of silence. \nTortorella would be suspended without pay for 15 days (and six games) and Hartley was fined $25,000. It was the night that many thought Tortorella lost his room.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:07:18.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
