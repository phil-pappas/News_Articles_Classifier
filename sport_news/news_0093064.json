The 11th-ranked Cardinal posted a stunning 24-26, 25-19, 16-25, 25-20, 15-13 triumph over No. 4 Washington in a manic Pac-12 women's volleyball match at Maples Pavilion on Wednesday evening. \nThe win, played in front of 2,262 spectators, kept Stanford (12-5, 6-3 Pac-12) in the conference race with 11 matches to play. The Cardinal proved it could play with one of the best teams in the nation -- the Huskies (17-2, 7-2 Pac-12). Stanford needs help to win or share the Pac-12 title, but the match served as a major confidence-builder heading down the home stretch. \n\"This was like a stepping stone for us,\" Stanford coach John Dunning said. \"It was really big for our team. We've been looking at a way to put our foot down and start building.\" \n\"This win means a lot to us,\" said Cardinal freshman outside hitter Hayley Hodson, who had a career and match-high 25 kills. \"This was a battle for us. It is a great thing to beat a highly ranked team and get back on the path.\" \nStanford nearly saw a 14-11 lead in Game 5 evaporate, but Dunning ran a set play for Howard, a Mountain View High grad, following the Cardinal's last timeout. \n\"For us to call a play, specifically, for Brittany on the last play and she took a big swing,\" Dunning said. \"That was a pretty gutsy play by her. That's what you have to do to win.\" Advertisement \nBugg finished with 55 assists, but it was a crucial dump by her that put the Cardinal up 14-11 in Game 5. \n\"Madi did a really good job,\" Dunning said. \"She is so experienced with the offense. She's the kind of player they lean on. She made lot a good choices in Set 5.\" \nThe match featured two players from the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League De Anza Division -- Howard and Washington middle blocker Melanie Wade, a former Daily News Player of the Year out of Palo Alto High. Wade, No. 7 all-time at Washington in blocks and in the top 10 in career hitting percentage, served tough, ending with five kills, three digs and an ace. \nThe Cardinal was hurt by the play of middle blocker Lianna Sybeldon, who had 19 kills while hitting a crazy .720, and Tia Scambray, who had 15 kills. Washington's Cassie Strickland, the reigning Pac-12 Libero of the Year, had 21 tough digs, but had an off night at the service line with six service-errors. \nWashington hit .519 in Game 3, one of the reasons for the easy win. \n\"We could not stop No. 10 (Sybeldon),\" Dunning said. \"She just went off.\" \nStanford middle blocker Merete Lutz had 13 kills and seven blocks, dominating the net with her 6-foot-8 frame. A big swing by Lutz and it was 3-2 Cardinal in Game 5. Hodson drilled home a winner, then backed it up with a wow-factor kill for 5-3. Howard put down a freeball as Washington coach Keegan Cook signaled time out. \nMiddle blocker Ivana Vanjak took a short set and delivered one of her six kills for 9-6 Cardinal. Lutz used an angle for a kill and it was 11-8. In one of the better sequences of the night, Lutz was blocked after receiving a set from Bugg. However, Bugg repeated the set with Lutz producing the winner. \nStanford was nearly done for in Game 4, trailing as much as 14-8. Somehow, the Cardinal found the resolve to rally. \n\"We were down 7-2 in Game 4 and we could have easily given in right there,\" Dunning said. \"We made some really good plays at that point.\" \nA Howard block and Stanford was within 16-13. Vanjak followed a Huskies' timeout with a block of her own. A rip by Lutz and the Washington lead was 19-17. Hodson, who had a brilliant match with 11 digs, served an ace. A block by Lutz and Stanford had come all the way back, tied 19-19. A Hodson ace, one of three on the night, put Stanford ahead 21-19. Howard's block and a booming kill by Hodson got game-point. A lift violation by the Huskies brought Game 5. \nHodson had 10 kills out of the back row, drawing praise from Dunning after the match. \n\"It's rare in our game to set anybody in the back row that often,\" Dunning said. \"It changes our offense and how people can deal with us. That was a pretty big-time performance. She served great, as well.\" \n\"Hodson is always amazing, but she was particularly amazing (tonight),\" Bugg said. \nHodson gave props to Bugg in return. \n\"Madi Bugg is a phenomenal setter,\" Hodson said. \"She does a good job locating and spreading our offense.\" \nStanford looked like a Final Four team in its Game 2 win as outside hitter Jordan Burgess warmed up with some nice swings. One of 10 kills by Burgess gave the Cardinal an 11-3 bulge. Lutz and Howard combined for a block for the biggest lead of the game, 22-11. The Huskies rallied to within 24-19, but Howard lowered the boom to end the game. \nThe Huskies played without outside hitter Carly DeHoog, who turned an ankle in a match against Oregon on Friday. DeHoog, who has 100 kills on the season, hobbled around the Maples hardwood on crutches. \nStanford, which has played without All-American middle blocker Inky Ajanaku all year because of an injury, keeps on persevering when the chips are down. \n\"We've had situations like that and not come back,\" Bugg said. \"Our team is sick of it. We've been trying to fight through that. It feels good to fight through it. Everybody had their moment and came through when we needed them to.\" \n\"We knew from Day 1 we weren't going to be as good as anyone thought we were going to be,\" Dunning said. \"You win a match like this, then another one, then, maybe, you believe you can win.\" \nEmail John Reid at jreid@dailynewsgroup.com ; follow him at twitter.com/dailynewsjohn .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:18:53.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
