In the top of the inning, Texas' Rougned Odor scored the go-ahead run with two outs when Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin's throw back to the mound hit batter Shin-Soo Choo, and the ball rolled up the third-base line. Fans pelted the field with debris during an 18-minute delay.\nIn the bottom of the inning, the Rangers committed three straight errors to help Toronto tie the score, and Jose Bautista hit a three-run homer, complete with an emphatic bat flip, for a 6-3 lead.\nBenches cleared twice during the half-inning. Toronto advanced to face the Royals in the ALCS, which starts Friday night on Fox.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
