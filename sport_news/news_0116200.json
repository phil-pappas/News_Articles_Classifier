It wasn’t the usual “Jose . . . Jose, Jose, Jose” or “M-V-P, M-V-P.” Instead, it was 500 joyous fans in a foreign land chanting “Thank you, Alex,” a tribute to GM Alex Anthopoulos. Never happens.\nOf course, Rogers ownership surely did not see that one coming when they made their first clumsy attempt last Dec. 9 to replace outgoing president Paul Beeston with a “baseball-first” incoming CEO — leading to the yet-to-be-corrected impression that Anthopoulos is now a lame-duck GM.\nIt was late July, with the Jays sitting at 50-51. First came the news that Anthopoulos had traded for all-world shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and managed to pawn the ever-stiffening glove of Jose Reyes onto the Rockies. Less than 24 hours later came news that David Price, the most desirable starting pitcher on the deadline trade market, was making his way through the tunnel from Detroit for a meeting with the men on the other side. The Jays suddenly had an ace. The result was a re-energized clubhouse teeming with consummate pros and an eventual berth in the post-season snapping a 22-year drought.\nOf course, Rogers ownership surely did not see that one coming, because through the first two months, Anthopoulos was ranked anywhere from 29th to last among effective MLB GMs. But the die was already cast with incoming president Mark Shapiro who will be taking over Nov. 1.\nIt was Aug. 7 at Rogers Centre when Jays fans realized the horsehide magic that was happening and started to attend games in numbers not seen in 22 years of mediocrity. The Jays ended the season with 30 straight crowds of 40,000-plus, with replica jerseys and Jays hats flying off the shelves for the new guys like Tulowitzki, Price and for the old guys like Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion.\nThen one day in late August vs. the Yankees, the Jays’ TV audience was 1.6 million viewers on a Friday night compared to the YES Network’s measly 600,000.\nOf course, Rogers ownership did not see that coming when they negotiated with Shapiro to migrate from a similar role in Cleveland, apparently promising him final say on player personnel matters. The Jays landscape has changed drastically since last Dec. 9, with Anthopoulos now a heroic figure in the GTA and across the country. Tough to inform him now that there’s a new sheriff in town. Anthopoulos contract ends on Halloween and Shapiro starts the next day. Trick or treat?\n“I can say that it has been my decision not to have any discussions with respect to that, because of the post-season, out of respect for what we were trying to do,” Anthopoulos said. “I can’t speak highly enough of Mark Shapiro, Rogers Communications. They’ve given me that respect and they’ve given me that time. That will be addressed at the appropriate time. But I can’t stress that enough, that was my desire to let the post-season go on, let everyone enjoy what we were doing and certainly to not distract from what we were trying to do. It will be addressed in time.”\nCould it be that Rogers may have to backtrack on promises made to Shapiro regarding his Putin-like influence on player personnel decisions? Or maybe he’ll do it on his own. Before he went into seclusion on anything Blue Jays, Shapiro reportedly told a national media type how excited he was to be getting back into player moves after years of allowing Tribe GM Chris Antonetti trade autonomy.\nIf Shapiro has been promised he is going to be a Theo Epstein (Cubs), Dave Dombrowski (Red Sox) or Andrew Friedman (Dodgers) type president/CEO, with a far higher profile then his GM, that will not work with the Jays. Maybe last Dec. 9 that could have been the plan, but the landscape changed.\n“I continue to do the job the way I always have,” Anthopoulos shrugged. “I think I’ve been very adamant. I love Toronto, kids, school and all that stuff. (The job status) will get addressed.”\nIt will never be about the money with Anthopoulos. His car and his house are paid for and anyone who has seen his news conferences on TV know that he’s not spending his money on the latest in the David Beckham line of suits. But what should already have been a contract slam dunk with a multi-year extension is coming down to perhaps a tussle over the player personnel thing.\nIt’s not the way MLB works. Nobody waits this late to confirm a GM. Other clubs have already filled front-office needs for 2016. If Rogers does not side with the Canadian kid when it comes to personnel moves, he’s on the street. If that happens, his MLB brotherhood will be dumbstruck and Rogers will just be dumb. Luckily for all of Anthopoulos’ lieutenants, their boss earlier in the summer locked them up to deals through 2016 — maybe seeing potential darkness on the edge of town.\nThe Jays playoffs was a magical ride for the city and the country but it could possibly end badly for Anthopoulos, the magician who pulled an ace from his sleeve and a rabbit out of his hat. He deserves more respect from Rogers but maybe this time they will actually see what’s coming.\nMore on thestar.com\nEvander Kane to miss 4-6 weeks with left knee injury\nRaptors keep harping on defence after quick playoff exit", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:54:18.407+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
