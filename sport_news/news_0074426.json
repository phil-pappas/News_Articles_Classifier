To our kids’ credit, they’ve stepped up. The younger guys have gained come in and gained confidence.” \n\nOffensively, Westerville Central is paced by Kentucky-bound tailback Benny Snell (1,388 yards, 21 touchdowns), and Darby counters with run-oriented option quarterback Nick Powers (1,214 yards, 19 TDs). \n\n“We’re clear on the opposite end of the spectrum in the way we do things offensively,” Magistro said. “We spread things out and go fast. They’re old-school in the way they run the option, chew up the clock and play sound defense. Just like last year, it’s a real good matchup. They knocked us off last year (35-10) when we were undefeated, but maybe there’s even more on the line this year.” \n\n\nBEST OF THE REST \n\nWorthington Kilbourne (7-1, 4-1) at New Albany (5-3, 4-1) \n\nKilbourne tries to right the ship after a 41-7 loss to Olentangy, and New Albany desperately needs to win its final two games to reach the playoffs. \n\nIndependence (6-2, 4-1) at Marion-Franklin (5-3, 4-1) \n\nThis can be regarded as an elimination game in the City League South Division’s four-way tie that also includes Eastmoor Academy and Walnut Ridge. It also has playoff implications as the 76ers are sixth and the Red Devils ninth in the same region in Division III. \n\nBeechcroft (5-2, 4-0) at Whetstone (4-4, 3-1) \n\nWhetstone handed Northland its lone City North loss and will try to play spoiler again. Although the Braves are identified by their \n\npassing game, their defense has allowed only 46 points the past five games. \n\nOlentangy Liberty (6-2, 3-2) at Dublin Coffman (5-3, 3-2) \n\nOnce regarded as the elite team in the area, Coffman might need to win out against Liberty and Upper Arlington to make the playoffs. \n\nHamilton Township (6-2, 4-1) at Logan Elm (6-2, 4-1), 7 p.m. \n\nLogan Elm controls its fate in the Mid-State League Buckeye Division and playoffs in closing at home against Hamilton Township and league-leading Teays Valley. \n\nColumbus Academy (4-4, 1-3) at Bexley (7-1, 4-0), 7 p.m. \n\nThe Headmaster’s Trophy will be on the line when these rivals meet. Columbus Academy, which leads the series 21-14-1, needs an upset to keep its faint playoff hopes alive. \n\nHarvest Prep (6-2, 4-0) at Fisher Catholic (6-2, 5-0), 7 p.m. \n\nTwo hot teams compete for the Mid-State League Cardinal Division title. Fisher has allowed just 37 points in a six-game winning streak. Harvest Prep is scoring nearly 44 points per game in its five-game winning streak. \n\nRiver Valley (6-2, 4-1) at Jonathan Alder (7-1, 5-0), 7 p.m. \n\nThis Mid-Ohio Athletic Conference Red title game pits Alder’s prolific passing game against a River Valley defense that has limited five opponents to single digits. \n\nLucas (8-0, 1-0) at Danville (8-0, 1-0), 7 p.m. \n\nDanville has outscored its opponents 433-32 and Lucas its 375-46. \n\n— Steve Blackledge \nsblackledge@dispatch.com \n@BlackiePreps", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:30:16.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
