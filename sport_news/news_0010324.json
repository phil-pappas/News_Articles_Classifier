Oct 15, 2015 at 5:28a ET 0Shares Jesse Jackson may only have been trying to provide hope, but his claim that Lamar Odom was responsive and improving on Wednesday caused conflicting reports about how well the former NBA star actually was doing. Jackson was in Las Vegas on the way to LA and stopped at Sunrise Hospital to pray over Odom, who is on life support after being found unresponsive at a Nevada brothel. Afterward, Jackson told reporters Odom seemed to be improving. \n\"Apparently from what the doctor said, he was much better off today than yesterday. He at least has some responsiveness now,\" Jackson said. \"He's got tubes in him now but we felt inspired by his presence. We're just holding hands and hoping he can bounce back.\" \nJackson confirmed Odom was surrounded by family and friends including Kobe Bryant and Odom's estranged wife Khloe Kardashian, who rushed to be by his side. \"When he does wake up, he will see her right there in the room with him,\" Jackson said. \"We certainly hope he comes out of this; it seems he will.\" \nJackson's comments were picked up by multiple media outlets and led to headlines claiming Odom's health was improving. TMZ , however, refuted Jackson's claim that Odom was improving, reporting that he remained unconscious and unresponsive and had suffered multiple strokes and kidney failure. TMZ's sources said Jackson had spent three minutes in Odom's room, not 30 as the reverend allegedly told reporters, and that he was ushered out immediately after praying over him. \n\"Family and friends are extremely concerned for Lamar,\" Odom's longtime publicist, Eve Sarkisyan, told Us . \"Please don't listen to the false information being circulated unofficially. Please respect the family's privacy during this difficult time.\" \nJackson later clarified his comments, telling The Daily Beast that Odom is \"a very sick man.\" \n\"He's not communicating in the verbal sense,\" Jackson said, and added: \"Apparently when he first got there he was totally non responsive. He's responsive to a minor degree now ... but he's fighting for his life.\" \n\"There was the feeling hoping he'll pull through,\" Jackson said. \"I asked people to pray for him because he needs it now, and he deserves it. I hope (he'll pull through). It's a very difficult situation right now. All we can do is hope and pray. He's such a source of inspiration to so many people.\" \nAlso on Wednesday, several outlets reported that though Kardashian and Odom both signed divorce papers in July, a judgment was never entered into court and thus their divorce was never finalized. That means the two of them remain legally married and thus, according to the reports, Kardashian is in charge of making all medical decisions for Odom. \n\"(Odom) never signed a living will, so Khloe is making decisions for him,\" a source told People Magazine , adding that the 31-year-old Kardashian \"is lost.\" \nTMZ reported Wednesday that the delay in the granting of divorce is due to \"an extreme backlog in the family law courts,\" and that the divorce is not expected to be finalized for two more months. \nTMZ also reported that Kardashian has \"already made several\" medical decisions on Odom's behalf. \nThe Nye County Sheriff's office held a news conference on Wednesday , during which time Sheriff Sharon Wehrly confirmed Odom is on life support. According to Wehrly, an employee at the brothel, Love Ranch, told 911 dispatchers that Odom was found unresponsive with fluid coming from his nose and mouth. \nThe caller said Odom had been doing cocaine and had taken up to 10 tabs of a sexual performance enhancer over three days. Odom bought the supplements, called Reload 72-hour Strong, at the brothel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:38:52.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
