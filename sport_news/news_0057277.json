She also captured the 50-free with a 22.89 clocking. It marked the first time this season she cracked 23 seconds. Ciesla, who won the Ann Marshall Award for the meet's outstanding female swimmer, was also on the winning 200 and 400-freetsyle relays.\n\"I always wanted to win this award,\" Ciesla said. \"I think it is such an honor to get this award from Ann Marshall. I think it is like the coolest thing ever.\"\nWhat is cooler is the fact that Ciesla will forgo defending her 50 and 100-free titles in the Class 1A high school meet to represent the United States at the FINA/Airweave World Cup Series in November in the Middle East. She will swim for the 18-and-under USA Swimming team and will compete in Doha, Qatar, Nov. 2-4 and Dubai, Nov. 6-8. The FHSAA State Class 1A meet is Nov. 6.\n\"Representing your country is awesome,\" said Ciesla, who received her USA gear on Friday and said it motivated her in Saturday's meet. \"It was such a hard decision. I cried for like three days when I found out that I was selected. I did talk to my coach and all of my teammates and asked them if they were OK with it, because I didn't want to hurt any of them.\"\nCiesla's efforts helped Pine Crest's girls finish just 23 points behind Bolles, which won the meet with 348 points. Boca Raton was third with 196 points.\nWestminster Academy sophomore Jessica Nava won the 100-yard butterfly (55.00) and the 100-yard backstroke (56.77). Boca Raton's Santana Sizemore won the 100-free (52.92) and placed second in the 200-free behind Ciesla.\n\"I was really happy with the times,\" Nava said. \"They are pretty close to my best times. This is good to help get me in the mindset for racing.\"\nBolles' showed off its depth as it cruised to the boys' title with 385 points. Pine Crest was a distant second with 226 points, while Boca Raton was third with 166 points.\nBolles boys have won a state-record 27 consecutive Class 1A state titles, while the girls have won 24 consecutive championships.\nUniversity School's Patrick Groters swept the 200-yard IM (1:53.37) and the 500-yard freestyle (4:36.36). In doing so, the sophomore was named the winner of the Andy Coan Award for the top male performance.\n\"I felt like this meet would be state-level, so I am pretty confident now going into the state competition,\" said Groters, who swam a personal best time in the 200 IM. He took third in the 500-free at the state meet last year and seventh in the 50-free.\nBoca Raton's Brody Heck celebrated his 18th birthday by winning the 200-yard freestyle (1:42.06). He recently committed to Auburn.\n\"I was fine with how I did today,\" said Heck, who won both the 50 and 100-freestyle events at the state meet last year and hopes to repeat this year.\nHarvard-bound Austin Fields set a personal best in winning the boys 1-meter diving competition with a 547.80. The Pine Crest senior was 13 points better than his previous best set last year at the district competition. Fields is gunning for his third consecutive state title.\n\"This represents doing the next level of dives, which are mostly the collegiate level dives and getting good scores on them,\" Fields said. \"It is a transition from my high school career to my collegiate career.\"\n Swimming Florida High School Athletic Association", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5622f7cb/turbine/fl-woodson-invitational-recap-1018-20151017"], "published": "2015-10-18T02:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:37:21.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
