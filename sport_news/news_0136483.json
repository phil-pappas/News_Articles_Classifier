The League body warned that if there is no prove of compliance after October 27, the club will be immediately deducted six points having failed to meet an earlier 60 days notice of summary jurisdiction. The LMC in a release made available to completesportsnigeria.com noted that the decision was sequel to the notice of Summary Jurisdiction issued the club on August 5 where the club was given a period of 60 days to remedy the breach. Warri Wolves, FC Taraba and Dolphins are other clubs that have been issued notices of summary jurisdiction with deadlines that fall within the month of October. \nMeanwhile, Sunshine Stars captain Sunday Abe has had his six-match suspension reduced by the LMC, reports completesportsnigeria.com. The former junior international was handed the ban after he pushed the centre referee during his side’s clash against 3SC. He has been unable to play in the Owena Waves’ last four games due to the suspension. The player according to the release by the LMC made available to completesportsnigeria.com has had his punishment commuted to a suspended sentence provided he maintains good conduct for the remainder of the season. The LMC said it took the decision in view of the apology and pledge to be of good behaviour earlier tendered by the player and the special circumstances of the club having over six players with different national teams. Following the reprieve, Abe will thus be available for selection by the club for their match day 33 fixture against Kano Pillars.
