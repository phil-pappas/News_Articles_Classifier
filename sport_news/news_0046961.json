But this is part of the stock-in-trade of UFC light heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier , who works as a UFC studio analyst for Fox Sports when he’s not in intensive training.\nSo he’s put last weekend’s classic five-round title defense against Alexander Gustafsson under the microscope — “I’ve only watched it on tape, honestly, 50 times in the last four days,” Cormier joked — and found a fight that looked even closer on tape then it felt in the cage.\n“In the cage it felt it was very close, but watching it back — I was like, ‘Man, this fight was really, really close,’ ” Cormier told the Herald. “There are only two clear rounds that a guy won, and that was me winning (Round) 1 and that was me winning 5. (Rounds) 2, 3 and 4 were so close. Especially 3. . . . I won 4:15 of that round and then I got knocked down. So when you get knocked down like that, the guy wins the round I think, in most cases. But one of the two judges actually scored it for me even though I got knocked down.”\nThat’s right, Cormier quibbles with the scorecards of two judges who gave him the third. He went on to earn a split decision to cap UFC 192 in Houston after a barnburner against the lanky and game Swede, who landed a vicious knee in the closing seconds of the third that dropped Cormier violently.\nCormier, staggered from the blow, said the fourth could also gone to his opponent, though he thinks his foe let it slip in the closing seconds.\nFor all his humility, Cormier says he deserved to win on all three judges cards, and was as miffed as UFC president Dana White at judge Derek Cleary ’s 48-47 scorecard for Gustafsson.\n“You can see Dana’s face whenever they read 49-47 Gustafsson,” Cormier said. “He’s just staring at the judge to his left. He doesn’t know if it was that guy’s scorecard, but it was the first judge that he saw, and he was like panicking, like what the hell? The dude did not lose three rounds of this fight.”\nNo ‘Bones’ about it: No MSG\nCormier threw a curveball into the UFC’s plans after the fight, declaring he would not stage his rematch vs. nemesis Jon “Bones” Jones at Madison Square Garden.\nThe UFC has tentatively booked a date in April for the vaunted venue, hoping to prevail in a court action that would throw out a state law banning MMA. Jones — a native New Yorker whom UFC stripped of the light heavyweight title after he was charged with fleeing an accident in New Mexico that injured a pregnant woman — would almost certainly be tapped to headline. He pleaded guilty last week to leaving the scene of an accident, and received 18 months supervised probation, during which time he will be allowed to fight.\nCormier is worried friendly locals in New York might tend to gloss over the hit-and-run and not force Jones to grapple with it in the run up to the fight.\n“There’s a pocket of this society that says, ‘Well, this guy is the greatest fighter of all time, and it doesn’t matter what he does outside the Octagon.’ But there is a vast majority of the world that says, ‘This is bad. No one should be able to get away with that,’ ” Cormier said. “People don’t like the 1 percent to get away with things that they don’t think everybody else could. So he would literally have to face that if he was in an environment that wasn’t so friendly.”\nCormier, who lost a decision to Jones in January (but won the then-vacant title vs. Anthony Johnson after Jones was stripped of the belt) and is recovering from an ankle sprain and ligament damage in his foot from the Gustafsson fight, said it wouldn’t be smart to fight Jones on friendly turf.\n“You’ve watched a ton of fights where the hometown guy gets cheered for everything, even if he’s hitting air, and the crowd goes nuts,” Cormier said. “Judges are human beings, they are right next to the Octagon watching the fight, they are hearing every reaction.”\nAnd every one of those reactions will matter if the fight plays out as Cormier envisions.\n“This is going to be a close fight, and I don’t want any advantages in his direction,” Cormier said. “And at the end of the day, I’m the champion, so they have to take my thoughts into consideration, too. . . . I’d love to fight in Madison Square Garden, but you don’t want to fight a New York boy there.”\nA lot of ‘Venom’ in his bite\nBellator MMA returns to Mohegan Sun on Oct. 23 for a live Spike TV event, and British striking sensation Michael “Venom” Page plans to bring his signature flash to a welterweight main card bout.\nPage (8-0), a lifelong kickboxer known for dancing and shimmying in front of befuddled opponents before uncorking hyper-accurate punches from awkward angles, will face Charlie Ontiveros (6-3) of Texas.\nPage promises a show, after he performs a quick assessment of his foe.\n“If you really notice, I do a lot of fakes and just seeing what kind of responses that my opponent has, and you learn a lot just from the small body movements, you really do,” Page said. “I spent years doing exactly that — faking, teasing, moving around. And also it builds a certain tenseness in your opponent, because they never know when you’re about to come in.”\nPage, who has four fights remaining on his Bellator deal, expects this approach to pay dividends.\n“I don’t find that many people have the same kind of judgment of distance and have the same kind of timing,” Page said. “So I’m enjoying it, until people start picking up and learning exactly what I’m doing.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:25:10.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
