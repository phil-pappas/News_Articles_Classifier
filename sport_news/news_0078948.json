There are a lot of people out there struggling. In a month when breast cancer is honored I think every type of cancer should be honored as well.” \nAccording to the Post-Gazette , Heyward said he would continue to wear the eye black for the rest of the month, even though the fine for the next offense would escalate to $11,576. \nCopyright   Monday, October 19, 2015 at 9:54PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:35:26.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
