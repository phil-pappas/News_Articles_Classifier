Wright. Rather than flag him for illegally batting the ball, officials ruled the play a touchback. \nCaldwell said he spoke with NFL VP of Officiating Dean Blandino on Tuesday, but the Detroit coach would not go into detail about that conversation. \nCaldwell says defensive tackle Tyrunn Walker is out for the season with a dislocated ankle and broken leg.
