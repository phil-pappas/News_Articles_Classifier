(AP) â€” When Kenny Rogers announced that he was retiring from touring, the Oak Ridge Boys were saddened.\n\"I have always thought, if Kenny Rogers can still be doing it, we can still be doing it,\" said Richard Sterban, the group's bass singer. \"After next year, Kenny won't be doing it and there will be a void.\"\nAdded Joe Bonsall, \"I can't imagine Kenny Rogers not being out there.\"\nBut don't expect the four-part vocal group to follow Rogers' lead anytime soon. They are as busy as they have ever been, traveling to Branson, Missouri, almost every weekend to perform at the theater named after them and getting ready to do a 31-city Christmas tour that kicks off around Thanksgiving.\nOn Sunday, Bonsall, Sterban, Duane Allen and William Lee Golden, who have all been performing together since 1973 as the Oak Ridge Boys, will be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame as one of the few gospel acts to successfully transition to secular music and become hit makers in multiple genres. Also being inducted this year: the late Jim Ed Brown; his sisters, Maxine and Bonnie Brown, and the late Grady Martin.\nThe band's origins date back to the Oak Ridge Quartet formed in 1945 by gospel icon Wally Fowler. The name of the band and the members changed during the '50s and '60s, but by the early 1970s, the band's current lineup started outgrowing the genre. They had four Grammys for gospel performances already, but signed to a new label in the hopes of reaching a wider audience.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:03:22.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
