Bush, John McCain, and in the last White House election, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.\nGray’s legal practice includes election law and ballot access, and he will be in charge of fielding petition signatures from voters that are needed to put Trump and a slate of delegates onto the March 15 primary ballot. Gray worked on Illinois ballot access for McCain’s 2008 campaign.\nThe signature-gathering process began Thursday with documents to be filed with the State Board of Elections in early January.\nIn the mid-1990s, Gray also served as executive assistant to then-Comptroller Loleta Didrickson.\nIn a statement making the announcement, Trump said: “We will continue to build out a substantial campaign team that allows us to take our message across the country and continue to share my vision to make America great again.”\nThe Trump campaign said in addition to Illinois, it has staff in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada, Florida, Texas, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama and Virginia.\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5617dc9b/turbine/ct-donald-trump-illinois-campaign-chief-20151009"], "published": "2015-10-09T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:41:29.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
