Ohio State – The Buckeyes are 7-0, beating teams by an average of 20.7 points, have won 20 consecutive games and Urban Meyer is still being questioned about his choice for starting quarterback. Ah, love you, Columbus.\n2. Michigan State – Grateful recipients of a golden gift from the football gods, the charmed and talented Spartans now continue their run toward a Nov. 21 date with the Buckeyes.\n3. Michigan – Giving a rivalry game away in ludicrous fashion won’t soon fade, but it doesn’t mask the fact that the vastly improved Wolverines are still dangerous.\n4. Iowa – Injuries are piling up, but so, too, are signs that this is a magical season for the reborn Hawkeyes, who are in surprising control of the West division.\n5. Wisconsin – Don’t count out Air-Bucky, not with Joel Stave passing for a total of 644 yards the past two games and the defense looking stingy.\n6. Illinois – After a week off to heal, the Illini should be refreshed as interim coach Bill Cubit tries to continue cleaning up Tim Beckman’s wreck.\n7. Nebraska – A 23-point win over Minnesota finally allowed the Cornhuskers to forget pondering another loss on an opponents’ final play.\n8. Penn State – Reality hit the Nittany Lions in Columbus like an anvil falling from the sky after they had enjoyed five soft wins at home.\n9. Northwestern – The Wildcats, once 5-0, have been outscored 78-10 in losses to Iowa and Michigan, and now they must go to Nebraska.\n10. Minnesota – Much was expected from the Golden Gophers, but this has been one of the league’s more disappointing teams this season.\n11. Rutgers – Will face OSU with its best player (WR Leonte Carroo) and best DBs (Blessuan Austin and Davon Jacobs) questionable because of injuries.\n12. Indiana – Basketball practice taking on more prominence as the Hoosiers have wasted a 4-0 start with losses to OSU, Penn State and Rutgers.\n13. Maryland – Interim coach Mike Locksley makes his debut against Penn State in a battle over recruiting turf.\n14. Purdue – Darrell Hazell is 1-18 in Big Ten play as soon-to-be “former” coach of the Boilermakers.\ntjones@dispatch.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T14:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:08:05.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
