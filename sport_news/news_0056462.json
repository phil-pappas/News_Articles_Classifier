(Photo: KREM2) CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWe are halfway through the prep football season and North Central's Layton Hahn earns Week 5 'Play of the Week' honors after his remarkable catch against Lewis & Clark Friday at Joe Albi Stadium. \nWith time running out in the 2nd quarter, Riley Smith chucks a ball down the field for his receiver. It originally looks like it is going to be picked off by Tigers defender David McKinzy, but Hahn tips the ball to himself and comes down with the catch. This play would later lead to a touchdown. \nNorth Central would lose to Lewis & Clark 38-14. \nWe will be spotlighting a play every Sunday on KREM 2 News. Make sure to join Darnay Tripp and Evan Closky for HSS 2Night Friday nights on KREM 2 News at 11.
