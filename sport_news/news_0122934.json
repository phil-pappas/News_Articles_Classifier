Hanratty and his Highlander teammates failed to score, losing 19-0. \nThe Highlanders, after a big overtime road victory the previous weekend, couldn't sustain their drives against Bergenfield, committed several key turnovers and lost the field position battle. \nThe result was a 19-0 loss to division rival Bergenfield that dropped the Highlanders to 2-4 on the season, 0-3 at home. \n\"We've been struggling with field position all year. It's been kind of our Achilles Heel,\" said Highlander coach Dan Dougherty. \"We just have to find a way to keep moving the ball. When we finally do, we can't make mistakes. That's the key to the whole thing.\" \nAfter the Highlander defense stopped the Bears on their first drive, a fumbled punt set Bergenfield up on West Milford's 31. \nA third down pass play then moved the Bears to the Highlander one. Bergenfield scored its first touchdown on the next play with about three minutes left in the first quarter. \nIn the second quarter, West Milford had problems getting out from under the shadow of its own goalposts. \nA short punt set the Bears up on the Highlander 35. \nIt took only one play for Bergenfield to score, on a pass from Jovani Haskins to Kyle Henderson at the 9:43 mark. \nThe Highlanders, near the end of the first half, started from their own 11, made a first down then turned the ball over when quarterback Anthony Hanratty threw his second interception of the half. \nBergenfield turned that miscue into a 19-yard TD pass by Haskins with only 15-seconds left in the half. \nWith the score 19-0, West Milford mounted its best drive of the game in the third quarter on a Hanratty run and a completed pass to Austin Hopler that set the Highlanders up on the Bear 19. \nTwo sacks and a penalty on fourth down blunted the drive at the 2:22 mark. \nIn the final quarter, the Highlanders moved the ball on a Hanratty to Daniel Cummings pass play that covered 38-yards but Hanratty was sacked on fourth down. \nDougherty noted that his team didn't convert key, drive sustaining plays against the Bears. \n\"It's been one play all the time. It's been the luck of the draw unfortunately for us,\" he said, adding, \"We just have to play mistake free football. When we do we're a great team.\" \n\"Our kids are very tight knit,\" he said, vowing, \"we're going to keep moving forward.\" Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:30:07.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
