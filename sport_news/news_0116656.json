Sprained ligaments and strained muscles top the list, often caused by “repetitive overuse” – practicing or playing too hard for too long – along with lack of proper conditioning, insufficient stretching or trauma.\nBut playing specific positions (such as defensive back, linebacker or offensive line) or performing certain maneuvers (including blocking and tackling) create the highest risk of suffering a more serious spine injury known as a “stinger,” Dr. Kadimcherla says. Stingers occur when the head is forced backward and toward the side, compressing one of the nerves in the spinal cord in the neck, or when the nerves in the neck and shoulder are overstretched as the head is forced sideways.\nThe result is a sudden and severe painful stinging sensation in one of the arms that can last from seconds to minutes. Stingers don’t result in paralysis, but tend to recur over time. “If not properly diagnosed and treated, stingers can lead to persistent pain or even arm weakness,” Dr. Kadimcherla says.\nAnother potential spine injury to young football players is spondylolysis, a degenerative disease resulting when cartilage in the vertebral discs of the neck and spine lose fluid and mobility, in turn causing pain and stiffness. Dr. Kadimcherla offers that proper diagnosis and conservative, non surgical treatment, is a first course of action for players with spondylolysis.\nTips for Preventing and treating spinal injuries from football\nIt goes without saying that preventing football-related spine injury is far superior to any treatment in sustaining a healthy back. Dr. Kadimcherla points out that prevention often starts with using the correct techniques for football moves such as squatting, tackling, blocking and take-downs. Proper muscle strengthening, conditioning and stretching before and after play is also vital, he says.\n“I always tell patients to ask their coaches for help in executing proper football techniques,” Dr. Kadimcherla says. “Most football-related back injuries can be avoided by educating players about how their spines work and which positions to avoid during play. If players avoid direct helmet hits and keep their heads up while tackling, instead of dropping their head before impact, they’re much less likely to suffer a neck injury.”\nOnce a back or neck injury has been sustained, however, proper diagnosis is key to effective treatment. Since most football-related back injuries are minor, typical treatments include:\n NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), which ease pain and swelling Ice and heat therapy – heat being more useful for muscle spasms Muscle relaxants Physical therapy, including special exercises to speed recovery from the athlete’s specific injury and strengthen weak muscles in the back, neck and arms Cortisone injection around the injured nerve root Taking a break from playing football for a period of time, depending on a doctor’s or trainer’s recommendation\nBefore returning to the gridiron, sport-specific exercises that mimic the movements the football player normally executes should be part of his recovery. “It’s also crucial to evaluate and correct poor technique and mechanics that may have led to the athlete suffering the initial injury,” Dr. Kadimcherla says. “Don’t get back on the field until you’ve addressed all the reasons you hurt your back in the first place.”\nAtlantic Spine Center is a nationally recognized leader for endoscopic spine surgery with several locations in NJ and NYC. http://www.atlanticspinecenter.com , http://www.atlanticspinecenter.nyc\nPraveen Kadimcherla, MD , is a board-certified orthopedic spine surgeon at Atlantic Spine Center.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/atlanticspine/footballinjury/prweb13033785.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.atlanticspinecenter.com/", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/atlanticspine/footballinjury/prweb13033785.htm", "http://www.atlanticspinecenter.com/about/praveen-kadimcherla/"], "published": "2015-10-22T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:17:16.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
