My goal is to be at the front of the line, but other than that it’s a wait-and-see kind of a plan.”\nMatt Behan\nSALT LAKE CITY — Growing up in the Boston area, University of Utah senior Matt Behan was a diehard sports fan but didn’t get to experience much of the collegiate athletics scene, save for a few good years for the Boston College football team with Matt Ryan at quarterback.\nWhen he started filling out college applications, Behan limited himself to Power 5 schools so he could go to a place that had a quality sports atmosphere. As such, Behan says the fact ESPN’s Saturday morning “College GameDay” television show is coming to the U. for the third time this weekend is “a little surreal.”\n“I thought that was a big part of the college experience, to be able to go to things like 'GameDay,'” he said. “For them to come here, it’s crazy. It’s gonna be good times. I’m excited.”\nBehan isn’t alone, as thousands are expected to converge on the Salt Lake City campus for events throughout the next two days before the fifth-ranked Utes hit the field at Rice-Eccles Stadium to face No. 23 California Saturday night (8 p.m. MDT, ESPN).\nThe festivities will kick off Thursday night with an 8 p.m. pep rally at the student union. Though not officially a part of the \"GameDay\" lineup of activities (it’s also Homecoming week at the university), Utah head coach Kyle Whittingham will be there to judge a sign-making competition in reference to one of \"College GameDay'’s great traditions, and the \"College GameDay\" crew will be filming the event. Utes' radio voice Bill Riley will host it.\nThe winner Whittingham chooses will receive two front-row MUSS tickets to Saturday’s game.\n“There’s definitely a different vibe just because it’s the biggest stage every week in the regular season for college football,” said MUSS president James Gabour. “It’s the best game that ESPN thinks is going on, so it’s definitely a different feeling this week just because they haven’t been here since 2010. It’s been five years, and students are just excited about it.”\nFriday is when \"College GameDay\" gets into high gear, as ESPN will broadcast shows from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m. at President’s Circle on campus, according to the university. As part of the action, there will be food, games, another sign-making competition and additional activities provided by major sponsors.\n“I’m having a little bit of dilemma because Cal is a great school and a great team, but in my opinion they are kind of blah in terms of creative material,” Behan said in regard to creating a clever sign. “I don’t hate Cal. I have nothing against Cal, so in terms of coming up with signs that are anti-Cal, it’s a little bit tough.”\nBeginning at 6 p.m. Friday, fans can begin camping out at President’s Circle to improve their chances of grabbing a good spot for Saturday morning’s show. According to the university, the first 300 fans in line will earn a place in the pit immediately adjacent to the \"College GameDay\" set. Fans will be allowed into the site beginning at 4:30 a.m.\nSecurity will be in place at President’s Circle from 6 p.m. Friday until after the show ends Saturday.\nHere's camping map for @CollegeGameDay in Presidents Circle. Campers should form line following red arrows. #goutes pic.twitter.com/tkmvhuStEt \n— Utah Athletics (@utahathletics) October 7, 2015 \n“It’ll be nice that it won’t be freezing cold outside and snowing,” said Behan, who was one of the students who organized Krystkowiakville last winter before the Utah men’s basketball team played Arizona at the Huntsman Center. “That’ll save us some hardship. I’m still kind of winging it. I’ve got a general idea of what I want to do, but I don’t know how the university is going to handle it. My goal is to be at the front of the line, but other than that it’s a wait-and-see kind of a plan.”\nFor those who aren’t keen on camping out, there will be free parking at the Merrill Engineering building. Fans are encouraged to arrive by 5 a.m. Additionally, Utah Transit Authority will have early TRAX and bus service.\nHeads up: @RideUTA will run two early trains and two early buses for fans headed to @CollegeGameDay Saturday #goutes pic.twitter.com/wfJdP1UXgU \n— Utah Athletics (@utahathletics) October 8, 2015 \nThe show will air from 7-10 a.m.\n“It hasn’t quite hit me,” Behan said of the show coming. “It probably won’t hit me until I’m sitting there camping out and 7 a.m. comes and they go live.”\nRyan McDonald is a sports reporter at DeseretNews.com .
