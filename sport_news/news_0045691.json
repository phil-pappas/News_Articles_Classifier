After two convincing wins over New Zealand A, India coach Oltmans had said that the team scoring field goals in their wins was a “good sign”. But not only did the team miss many chances today, it conceded a goal in the first five minutes. The hosts got a penalty corner in the 5th minute and Nick Haig’s drag-flick ricocheted off the goalkeeper’s pad and went into the net. India intensified the attack but the possession amounted to nothing as New Zealand defended well. Ramandeep Singh failed to capitalise on an Akashdeep Singh pass in the circle. In the 27th minute, Auckland’s Jared Panchia scored the second goal, a great piece of play that finished when he received a pass from Ryan Archibald before slotting it home. Despite repeated attacks, India were disappointing in the opposition third, failing to break a solid Kiwi defence. The best opportunity came to Birendra Lakra, but his effort was saved by the Kiwi goalkeeper. “It was a good win, I think it’s coming together really well. The guys haven’t been together for a while so I think it was a good performance,” said Haig. New Zealand’s Steve Edwards made his 200th international appearance. The second match will be played in Nelson on Wednesday.
