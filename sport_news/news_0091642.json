I see Stance socks, but don't see Team Stance socks in NBA MyCAREER games. You can't adjust sock length, for those that were hoping to see it added. # 1 b0ck3n @ 10/22/15 08:27 AM Can anyone confirm if the headband issue is fixed? (with the same update that removed socks, headbands were glitched and removed longer hair-styles and morphed the back of the head slightly) # 2 Trent Booty @ 10/22/15 08:39 AM Yeah, wondering about the headband issue as well. Not too worried about the socks anymore, I used ankle tape and it's a good look as far as colored socks go. # 3 daveberg @ 10/22/15 08:42 AM nd no fix for legends teams having wrong colour socks ?? What a surprise. # 4 kadzier @ 10/22/15 08:43 AM does anyone know if they added the ability for us to wear stance socks in NBA games/change sock length? or are we still stuck with default mid length black/white socks that don't match the rest of our team? # 5 camjones10 @ 10/22/15 08:43 AM but still no adjusting sock length like usual # 6 adfromkg @ 10/22/15 09:09 AM is there anyway to change the colorway of the shoes you purchase or are you stuck with the default home and away color during my career # 7 infam0us @ 10/22/15 09:34 AM Quote: nd no fix for legends teams having wrong colour socks ?? What a surprise. That's a roster thing, if/when they fix it will likely be in a roster update. # 8 Steve_OS @ 10/22/15 09:37 AM Quote: Originally Posted by kadzier does anyone know if they added the ability for us to wear stance socks in NBA games/change sock length? or are we still stuck with default mid length black/white socks that don't match the rest of our team? Looks like default Stance socks, I have Pistons Stance team socks and don't see them in-game. They are fine at The Park. # 9 MT3 @ 10/22/15 10:13 AM I can buy anything at all ... # 10 seanbarkley @ 10/22/15 10:40 AM Can someone check if they fixed the lack of socks with full leg accessories in the edit player menu please? # 11 DaPope13 @ 10/22/15 10:49 AM Id rather have no socks than what we've had for the past 3 years # 12 BigNasty35 @ 10/22/15 11:23 AM Quote: Originally Posted by DaPope13 Id rather have no socks than what we've had for the past 3 years Eh, I know the standard socks kinda stink, but I'll take that over looking like a hippie. # 13 KGDunks @ 10/22/15 11:34 AM Quote: Originally Posted by seanbarkley Can someone check if they fixed the lack of socks with full leg accessories in the edit player menu please? Nope. Still yet to fix the abomination that is the '80s Celtics having black socks along with other classic teams having awfully wrong socks too. # 14 Punk @ 10/22/15 11:56 AM How're they gonna add socks back but not fix the length? # 15 TUSS11 @ 10/22/15 12:05 PM Can I finally remove that stupid half shoulder sleeve now? # 16 MontanaMan @ 10/22/15 12:25 PM Quote: You can't adjust sock length, for those that were hoping to see it added. Why is this so difficult?!? # 17 McG @ 10/22/15 12:56 PM Does anyone know when they are going to fix the issue with losing your rewards from MyCareer? I finally got Terminal 23 this morning and it's gone, I still have it equipped, but the option to remove it or put it on is completely gone. I really want to get the Kemp and Payton jerseys but I'm not going to risk them being gone for ever. Plus, I play every game. I just hit the playoffs, I'm not grinding another player just to get rewards. If and when they fix it. # 18 infam0us @ 10/22/15 01:16 PM Quote: Can I finally remove that stupid half shoulder sleeve now?
