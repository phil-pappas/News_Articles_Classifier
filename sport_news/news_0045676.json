LOUIS (AP) - St. Louis Rams outside linebacker Alec Ogletree, the team's leading tackler, will undergo surgery Tuesday for a broken right ankle and could be out for the season.\nCoach Jeff Fisher said Monday the team would have a better idea after the procedure. He said Ogletree attended team meetings and was optimistic he could be placed on injured reserve/designated for return.\nAkeem Ayers becomes the starter for now. Ayers made four starts for the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots last season and got a one-year deal in St. Louis.\nOgletree was hurt when teammate T.J. McDonald landed on his legs while trying to make a diving tackle in the second half of Sunday's 24-22 victory at Arizona. He had 11 tackles against the Cardinals and has 55 on the year, hitting double figures every game.\n\nAP NFL websites: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
