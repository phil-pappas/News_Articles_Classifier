I saw there was a 50-plus age category, so there's a reasonable chance, I thought I might be able to bring a first place but not train,\" Gurney said at the completion of his race, before the results were known. \n\"But those old buggers go bloody hard. They really pushed me. I don't know if I have won it.\" \nHowever, when the times for Saturday's race were collated, Gurney was victorious in that \"old-bugger\" section. \nThe kayak, cycle and run event was held around the Rakaia Domain, a walkway, a farm and on the Rakaia River. \n\"I had to come out of retirement for the inaugural event. You only get the chance to do an inaugural event once. And I have never raced on the Rakaia before. It's a special thing.\" \nGurney has won the gruelling Coast to Coast nine times but, was \"retired\" from the world of multi-sports - in part because he hates running. \nThree kilometres into the rugged 13km run, which saw participants clambering over the river bed, Gurney tore his Achilles' tendon. He battled through, not worried if it would affect him getting a good time. \n\"It's not about times. It's about placing and winning my category.\" \nHe noticed the spectators were gunning for him. They were cheering for \"their person\" to take him on, he said. \n\"I would hear them yelling [at the person they were supporting] to get me. A bit cheeky. I'm an old man now, so it's not really being competitive is it.\" \nWhether or not he would do it all again next year, Gurney wasn't entirely sure. \n\"It was a great race and I wanted the opportunity to have a go on the Rakaia.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:18:20.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
