No, as the show’s most recent episode makes clear, the Redskins actually become the Redclouds in time for the 2019 season , with the creation of a horrific logo to boot. \nThe latest episode features [ random description of plotline I totally didn’t follow because I was just looking for images of football jerseys ]. And strikingly, a key piece of evidence in the case is an authentic jersey dating from 2019. \n“It’s a 2019 Redclouds jersey,” [ random main character whose name I didn’t catch ] says when this image flashes in front of her. “It’s the year that they changed their name; it’s almost impossible to get. Believe me, I’ve tried.” \nI mean, couldn’t it also have been just a modern jersey affixed with cheap, generic 2019 season patch? Or just a knock-off replica jersey? Like, I’ve seen people wearing Washington Senators hats at Nats games, and it never occurred to me that they were actual authentic hats once worn by Frank Howard. But maybe by 2065 scientists will have eradicated cheap replica jerseys, and any jersey with a 2019 patch will necessarily date from 2019. \n[ Minority Report reveals Nats as 2054 World Series champs ] \nIn any case, as the episode goes on to show, this particular Redclouds jersey actually is a No. 10 model. Which means that no, the Kirk Cousins-Robert Griffin III debate is likely not over, even in 2065. Maybe by 3065 we’ll be good.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:51:51.394+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
