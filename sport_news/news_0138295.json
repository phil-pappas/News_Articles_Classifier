I really can‚Äôt believe The President or Chancellor hasn‚Äôt forced Jurich to force Pitino to resign. Yesterday and the day before the scuttlebutt in the Athletic Department was that Pitino was gone. Today somebody said that Jurich is defending Pitino even harder behind the scenes. Absolutely crazy. Jurich should be fired too. Catlogic15 October 21, 2015 at 4:42 pm | Permalink \nJurich wants Pitino there as long as he can. He wants to wait to serve him up when the NCAA gets serious.

Personally, I think Jurich should also face scrutiny but he will slither quietly away I‚Äôm sure and let others take the fall, he‚Äôs good at that. \n‚Ä¶and honestly, Pitino coached here too, does anybody actually believe he didn‚Äôt know about this? Dude is a tyrant and knows every aspect of everyone‚Äôs business or at least he did at UK. Unless that changed I call BS on him.

After her hagiographic defense of Lance Armstrong without expressly acknowledging that she ghost wrote a book for Mr. Armstrong, I agreed with Mr. Walsh of the Sunday Times that Ms. Jenkins had forfeited her right to continue as a journalist and should disappear. So I promised myself I would never read anything she wrote again. I need to pay closer attention to the byline. Perhaps articles written by Ms. Jenkins should come with a warning .

There is a lot of components involved here that no one knows about but, apparently, most of you and the writer of this glorious (sarcastic) article know more than the NCAA at this time to the point where you are confident in your stance and opinions. Pitino is a coach but, he is also a father, a patriarch in his family, a mentor and more, How about respecting those that are his ‚Äòfamily‚Äô and stop the noise. If any one of you can look in the mirror and truly state that you have not done something in your life that you regret and shouldn‚Äôt have done then by all means, continue to post judgement and blame. He made a mistake in the past, but, who hasn‚Äôt? B/c of his highly public role, his mistake provoked national media attention. I believe everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves forgiveness and second chances. He has kept a clean slate and if it comes out that mcgee was the one and only UL staff member that took part and created this mess, you all might feel pretty bad (at least I hope ‚Äì b/c otherwise you aren‚Äôt human) to smear pitino‚Äôs name. You all are contributing to what is wrong with our society ‚Äì there is no focus on positive, good feeling stories but, negative media and judgement and ridicule; congrats, most of you are now part of that. I wish you all peace and have some faith in our system to get to the truth and be the ones to judge in a legal manner. I am supporting pitino.
