Jason Cowan / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. The Cal Fire command post at Frogtown has been all but disbanded, the base where Pacific Gas and Electric stored operational equipment has become an empty lot and dozers used to create breaks along the fire’s edge are being hauled back to wherever they came from. As containment of the Butte Fire reached 96 percent on Tuesday evening, the Calaveras County Board of Supervisors Tuesday night shifted its focus to planning and getting people back home. Supervisors unanimously approved an initial budget for the Butte Fire. As of now, the initial budget exceeds $10.7 million — 75 percent of which will be funded by the federal government, nearly 19 percent by the California Disaster Assistance Act and about 6 percent to be funded through the county. The money will go toward salaries and benefits as well as services and supplies. However, at this point, the total may change as the county identifies additional needs that may require attention to help the community recover. “We still have a long way to go,” said Shirley Ryan, county administrative officer. “Our budget is just a plan. We don’t know what those actual numbers are going to turn out to be.” Ryan said it is likely additional appropriations and additional funding sources will be needed. The adjustment may begin as soon as the next board meeting. Ryan says that Assistant County Administrative Officer Brian Moss may provide a presentation to the board and the public to help understand the planning process and the direction. Special meeting The Calaveras County Board of Supervisors also met earlier on Tuesday and unanimously approved two other Butte Fire related agenda items. Due to environmental and physical hazards from the fire, the board continued the local state of emergency, something that must be done every 14 days. “Homes have been lost, structures have been damaged, there are toxic materials there, heavy metals, asbestos, there’s plastic,” said Dr. Dean Kelaita, Calaveras County health officer. “Environmental cleanup is in place. The continuance of a local health emergency allows funding to help with that.” In addition to the extension of the local state of emergency, the county also entered into Memorandums of Agreement with each law enforcement agency the sheriff’s office requested aid from to assist with the fire. “As a course of fighting the Butte Fire, we did mutual aid with a number of law enforcement agencies to assist the sheriff,” Ryan said. “Agencies that supported us throughout the fire can get reimbursed up to 75 percent of the costs.” The reimbursements will come from state and federal sources.
