None more so than CC Sabathia, who was bear-hugging teammates, posing for pictures, speaking from the heart about getting back to the postseason.\nAdChoices BOX SCORE: YANKEES 4, RED SOX 1\n“It feels like an eternity,\" he said. “It really does. It was a long road. Real long. It feels great.\"\nSabathia was talking about the two years the Yankees went without champagne, but he could just as well have been detailing his personal journey, how he returned from the dead after knee pain had forced him to the disabled list in late August, and wound up pitching the clincher on Thursday night.\n“I was scared for sure when I went down,\" he said. “I didn’t know where I was headed. But then with rest, with treatment, I felt I had a chance to come back. But to be out there tonight... it’s a bonus.\"\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE\nHe wasn’t the CC of old on Thursday night, and he’ll never be that guy again. In truth, his five innings of work were a 96-pitch slog over five innings, but he refused to buckle, allowing just one run, and on this night that was enough.\nThe final was 4-1, as Adam Warren returned to his role in the bullpen — for now, at least — to provide a huge lift, going three innings, before Dellin Betances closed out the win that clinched the long-awaited wild-card spot.\nIn fact, this week alone was starting to feel like an eternity after the Yanks lost three straight to the Red Sox.\n“It wasn’t easy,\" Joe Girardi admitted with a sigh afterward.\nWith that in mind, their spotty play in recent weeks has tempered expectations for a memorable October, and the wild card is a consolation prize after the Blue Jays blew past them to win the AL East.\nBut they can still change all of that. And Thursday night’s clincher was a reminder that these Yankees can be dangerous as well, with a killer late-game bullpen that is deeper now with Warren back in the mix, and the power bats that can match up with anyone, even the mighty Blue Jays.\nOn this night the Yankees hit three home runs, getting one from Carlos Beltran and two from “the kids,\" as Girardi called them, Greg Bird and Rob Refsnyder, the young second baseman who may be forcing his way into the postseason plans.\n“I like the mixture we have of veterans and young guys,\" Girardi said. “All year long when things started to look bad, this team bounced back.\"\nIt seemed to be Girardi’s way of saying: Underestimate us at your own risk in the playoffs.\nFair enough. But do Yankee fans believe that? It’s an intriguing question, considering the sparse crowds at the Stadium this week. Obviously the weather was an issue on Thursday night, but it was still rather startling to see the place less than half-full on a night when a win assured a clinching.\nWhat is it about this team that hasn’t quite captured the fancy of Yankee fans? Is it simply that the romance has gone out of the Bronx since the retirement of the Core Four?\nIt’s fair to say there is a lack of charisma and star power, which would have been all the more noticeable had A-Rod not returned from his PED suspension with such unexpected ferocity, hitting 33 home runs.\nBut young, home-grown potential stars have emerged in Bird and Luis Severino, and now Refsnyder as well, so perhaps this team will grow on fans if it does make some noise in October.\nIf nothing else, anyone who appreciates the game should have a soft spot for Sabathia, who earned his pinstripes in 2009 by leading the Yankees to a championship and has fought gamely against injuries and innings mileage to keep his career from going over the cliff.\nIn the middle of the clubhouse celebration, you could tell it meant the world to Sabathia that he delivered a solid start, and you got the feeling it meant more to his teammates.\n“He’s our leader,\" Warren said. “He’s a guy everybody looks up to because of the way he handles his ups and downs, because he cares so much about the team. And, of course, he winds up pitching the big game tonight, because that’s who he is.\"\nEven so, Sabathia had an ERA over 5.00 for five months, and it appeared his season was over when knee pain forced him to the disabled list. Instead, rest and the support of a bulky knee brace have changed everything.\nIn five starts since returning he has a 2.17 ERA, in part, because, he said, “I’m a different guy with the brace. I don’t have any fear of pain. I can just pitch.\"\nIt doesn’t mean Sabathia can be counted on to put up zeroes. But you can’t rule it out either.\nSame goes for these Yankees. The odds are against them. But they’re back in the tournament. “Eternity\" is over.\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 4 NEXT SLIDE > Sabathia only lasts five innings, but gets his sixth win of the season. - Andrew Theodorakis/ for New York Daily News © Provided by New York Daily News\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.nydailynews.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Swihart", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf1mFd.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Marrero", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;baseball_mlb&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf1Aqc.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Beltran", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAeYVLC.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Yankees", "https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAeVOLM.img&quot;}}", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:32:40.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
