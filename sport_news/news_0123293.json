The main topic of discussion revolved around the Civic Center's previously successful bid from Sept. 25 to retain the event.\nOfficials from the NYSPHSAA subsequently raised questions regarding bid figures made during the Glens Falls Civic Center written proposal and its oral presentation, which led to an Oct. 9 decision to reopen the bid process.\nThursday, the NYSPHSAA Executive Committee voted against Glens Falls for the three-year bid from 2017-19 and later passed a resolution to make revisions on the bidding process for all NYSPHSAA championship events moving forward.\nGlens Falls Civic Center has been the host site of the state boys' basketball tournament since 1981.\nAsked Thursday when he hoped to have the new vote on the NYSPHSAA boys' basketball tournament site for 2017-19, NYSPHSAA executive director Robert Zayas said, \"My goal is to have everything complete by the end of the holidays.\"\nDoug Kenyon , the state boys' basketball tournament director, entered Thursday's meeting deeply concerned sentiment was against Glens Falls and shifting in a positive direction toward Binghamton, the group that finished second in bidding process in September.\n\"I am optimistic, and pleased, that we got through this. It was a tough one,\" Kenyon said. He added that some on the committee were concerned that the written and oral bid presentations had different figures.\nMoving forward, the bidding process will involve sealed bids. The state boys' basketball committee will make its recommendations first, followed by Zayas and his staff. The NYSPHSAA Championship Advisory Committee will pass along its report and then the NYSPHSAA Executive Committee (a 22-member panel featuring two representatives from each of the state's 11 sections) will vote.\nKenyon does not know what the next vote will bring, but added he's pleased to \"still be in the fight.\"\n\"It was a long day,\" Kenyon added. \"I was concerned they would put a motion on the floor (Thursday) for Binghamton.\"\nThe irony regarding the differences between the written and oral presentations the Civic Center provided is the latter actually was $15,000 below the written bid because of a change in concession providers saved money.\n\"We'll do our best to try and retain this. We certainly do not want to lose this,\" Kenyon said. Among the other major things voted on Thursday, a motion to increase the number of regular-season hockey games from 20 to 22 was defeated and a potential vote for the addition of a sixth classification for football was postponed.\nThe NYSPHSAA Executive Committee later approved a motion to reconvene its Championship Philosophy Committee (last utilized in 2011) to look closer at the merits of a sixth football classification.\nThe delay in the vote could mean that it may not be decided on in time to take effect for the 2016-17 scholastic year.\njallen@timesunion.com • 518-454-5062 • @TUSidelines", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/31/8836735/5/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/31/8836735/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/31/8836735/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T07:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:33:37.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
