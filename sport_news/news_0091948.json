He scored four touchdowns against Kentucky Wesleyan in 1994.\nPittenger, who also threw for 142 yards, scored three times before halftime as Maryville built a 24-6 lead.\nAverett (1-5, 1-2) rallied in the second half. The Scots needed a late defensive stand to withstand a turnover and hold on for the win.\nPittenger's four touchdowns give him 29 for his career. He is now third all-time in Maryville College history. The record is 33 held by Travis Felder (2010-2013).\nDeshjion Whitlock rushed for 81 yards for the Scots. Michael Smith caught seven passes for 97 yards.\nGabe Johnson and Jonathan Clark paced the Scots' defense, which held Averett to 4-of-14 on third-down conversions. The pair combined for 14 tackles with Clark recording three tackles for a loss.\nThe Scots will play LaGrange College at 1:30 p.m. Saturday at Honaker Field in Maryville.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:44:09.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
