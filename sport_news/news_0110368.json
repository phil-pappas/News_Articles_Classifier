He adds depth to a line after starting right tackle Seantrel Henderson sustained a concussion against Cincinnati. \nThe Bills also shuffled their practice squad roster by signing receiver Titus Davis and releasing quarterback Dustin Vaughan. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:58:51.869+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
