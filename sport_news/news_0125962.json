He was in the end zone. It had been a while. A simple two-yard run had gotten him there, only it wasn't so simple at all. To score the Minnesota Vikings' first touchdown in a 31-14 victory over the San Diego Chargers on Sunday, Peterson had to run through the arms of two defenders before meeting a third, linebacker Manti Te'o, at the goal line. He arrived like a man who hadn't hit NFL pay dirt in over 22 months. As Peterson lingered on the purple-painted end-zone turf, he was surrounded by happy teammates and enveloped by adoring cheers from the TCF Bank Stadium stands. Number 28 is beloved in Minneapolis, to be sure, but not everywhere; not since he became known as a child abuser. Those words – \"child abuser\" – are harsh and heavy, but they fit a man who in 2014 pleaded no contest to a charge of reckless assault for beating his 4-year-old son's lower body with a tree branch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T09:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:10:21.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
