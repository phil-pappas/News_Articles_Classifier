There is no indication when Saunders might return — some reports have speculated he’ll miss the entire season — and he delegated his top assistant to take over.\nIt’s the first time Mitchell has been an NBA head coach since he was fired 17 games into the 2008-09 season in Toronto and there are lessons he learned then that are helping him today.\n“I wore myself out the first time, it’s a long season and these are good basketball coaches and they’re smart,” he said.\n“You’ve got to trust your staff. I’m around these guys enough and talk to them enough — and all we do is talk basketball — that these are some sharp minds. You’d be doing yourself a disservice by not using those guys.”\nRaptors coach Dwane Casey can emphasize with Mitchell, having followed a similar NBA coaching arc.\nCasey was the head coach in Minnesota for a season and a half, let go despite a 20-20 record in his second season in a move that caught many by surprise. It took him four seasons to get another head coaching job — obviously under different circumstances than Mitchell — but the lessons learned were the same: Experience is a great teacher.\n“Now I know some of the decisions that you make offensively, defensively, in game situations, you can honestly say they were mistakes,” Casey said Sunday. “Hindsight is undefeated; at the time you’re going through it, you don’t think you made any.\n“It’s one of those things that as you’re going through it, there’s no substitute for experience.”\nAfter he was fired in Toronto with an 8-9 record following two playoff seasons and a coach of the year award, Mitchell worked as an assistant with the New Jersey Nets and Timberwolves sandwiched around stints as a television and radio personality.\nHe never doubted his coaching skills, biding his time.\n“I felt like if I come back, work hard, do my job, be diligent and hard-working, keep my nose to the grindstone, then eventually I would get another chance,” Mitchell said.\n“Obviously you don’t want it to happen under these circumstances but things happen for whatever reason that’s out of our control. Now I am thrust in this position so I have to right by the organization and right by the players.”\nMore on thestar.com\nArgos not fooled by Alouettes poor record\nDavid Price could pitch out of Blue Jays’ bullpen if needed tonight", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:33:06.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
