Fort Lee's junior center back/center midfielder Andy Won got that opportunity, when the Bridgemen beat Dwight Morrow, 3-2, in overtime Oct. 15. \nThe two boys varsity soccer teams met under the lights in a Big North, American Division rematch from earlier this season. They first played Sept. 10 and Fort Lee beat visiting Dwight Morrow, 3-1. \nSCORING EARLY \nFort Lee drew first blood with a goal, only a minute and 30 seconds into the game. Junior Shunsaku Sagawa found junior Peter Kim, who tricked the goalie with a fake and buried his shot in the back left corner of the net. The Maroon Raiders refused to roll over and give up, though. \nThey had a score of their own roughly four minutes later. Sophomore Tafari Williams found senior Brian Fernandez with a pass and Fernandez chipped the ball over Fort Lee senior goalkeeper and captain Mohamed Abdelhamid's head and into the net to tie the game at 1-all. \nDespite early scores by both sides, Abdelhamid and Dwight Morrow's senior goalie Christian Roszkowski both played extremely well. They made saves that you'd expect to see at the World Cup, not during a high school soccer game. Both of them were forced to deflect shots away with their feet throughout the match. \nSECOND CHANCE \nLess than two minutes into the second half, the Maroon Raiders drew a penalty kick. Senior Mateo Giraldo was chosen to take the kick and Abdelhamid guessed correctly and dove to his left but the ball bounced off the back of his foot and rolled across the line. \nThe referees waved off the goal, however, because one of Dwight Morrow's players crossed into the goalie box too early. Giraldo took the attempt again and this time Abdelhamid knocked it away. \nAbdelhamid explained the varying emotions between the two kicks. \n\"On the first penalty kick I read him but he didn't kick it the way he wanted to,\" he said. \"Still, it hit off my foot and went in. I felt bitter disappointment and I thought what could I have done differently? \n\"I got a second chance at it though, thankfully. I said, 'I'm not going to let this happen again,' and I heard some guy on the sideline say 'atro lavo,' which in Spanish means other side. I read the player again and I dove that way.\" \nHEADING TO OVERTIME \nFive minutes later, Fort Lee took a 2-1 advantage. Junior captain Justin Piache scored off of a rebound. Jared Brusco took the original shot and was credited with the assist. Coming into this game, Piache led the team in goals scored with 13 and Brusco led in assists with five. \nThe pesky Maroon Raiders didn't waiver though. \nWith 15 minutes left to play junior Luis Martinez launched a shot that hit off the bottom of the crossbar and appeared to hit the white line in front of the goal, meaning it wasn't a score. Luckily for Dwight Morrow junior Matt Roszkowski was there to kick the ball in and even the score at 2-2. \nThe game went into overtime and Fort Lee broke the deadlock in the first extra session. \nA few minutes in, Piache found Won, who place the ball into the left side of the net and gave the Bridgemen the thrilling 3-2 victory. \nWon was mobbed by his ecstatic teammates before the two squads lined up to shake hands. He wasn't expecting to be in this position. \n\"I was thankful to get in the game after a long rest,\" he said. \"I was happy that I was able to impact the game. As a result, we got the win.\" \nPiache didn't think Fort Lee played their best game. He thought the team took their foot off the gas for a bit, which is not a common thing for them.
