We were pretty lucky that we could play in a quarter-final with our full forward pack.” \nThe openside flanker then highlighted the performances of 20-year-old centre Tyler Morgan, reserve scrum-half Gareth Davies and New Zealand-born full-back Gareth Anscombe as encouraging signs for Wales’ future. \n“Considering you have got Tyler coming in, and he still does a great job, it’s great going forward. \n“Gareth Davies got a few tries and him and Tyler and Anscombe are great going forward.” \nFour years ago, Warburton was sent off as Wales were edged out 9-8 by France in a thrilling semi-final in Auckland. \nAt the aged of 27, he could well have a couple more World Cups left in him. \nBut for the likes of 34-year-old veteran prop Gethin Jenkins, Saturday’s loss was probably their final World Cup appearance. \n“No-one knows who is going to be around in four years’ time,” said Warburton. “I feel for guys like Gethin. You try your best for players like that.” \nCoach Warren Gatland was unable to hide his despair. \n“We’re absolutely gutted,” he said. \n“The guys put their bodies on the line, gave everything. That’s all we can ask of them but we weren’t good enough to hold on for 80 minutes. \n“Credit to South Africa, they stayed in the game but we’re very disappointed.” \nWales scored a first-half try when Davies was sent in by Dan Biggar after the fly-half’s excellent kick and chase. \nBiggar himself kicked Wales’ remaining 14 points to leave the Welsh on the brink of just their third victory in 31 Tests against South Africa. \nBut they gave away several breakdown penalties, with Springbok fly-half Handre Pollard kicking 18 points before du Preez’s try put the result beyond doubt. \n“From an effort point of view, we have no regrets,” said Warburton. \n“But 12 points in the first half after we gave away four penalties, all when we weren’t under very much pressure, for me those were the most crucial points we gave away.” \nWales came through the so-called ‘Pool of Death’, beating hosts England 28-25 in a Twickenham thriller before losing 15-6 to fellow last-eight qualifiers Australia. \n“Wales can be very proud of these players,” said Gatland. “Coming out of that group, which was so tough, set us up pretty nicely for what we knew was going to be a tough game. \n“They’ve given 100 per cent.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:40:20.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
