That's the question AL.com's Mark Heim and Creg Stephenson look to answer in this week's edition of SECond Look. \nAlabama hosts Tennessee this week in the traditional \"Third Saturday in October\" game (played this year on the fourth Saturday in October), while Auburn is at Arkansas. The Crimson Tide has an eight-game winning streak against the Volunteers, though that doesn't diminish the rivalry, Heim said. \n\"I think it can better be dubbed 'Hate Week' when it comes to Alabama-Tennessee rather that just a rivalry,\" Heim said. \"When it comes to rivalries, I don't think winning streaks matter. When Tommy Tuberville held up six fingers, it didn't less any of the rivalry between Alabama and Auburn.\" \nAs for Auburn-Arkansas, the presence of Bret Bielema has ramped up the heat in that series. \n\"Gus Malzahn is from Arkansas, coached there at one time,\" Stephenson said. \"Bret Bielema, for whatever reason, has made Auburn his target.\" \nSo what constitutes a college football rivalry?
