Robin Lopez is on the loose inside Christl Arena and his squad just lost a 5-on-5 scrimmage.\nThe Knicks new center’s defensive ferocity is making a large impact on the coaching staff and Carmelo Anthony, who admitted he used to “hate’’ the former Blazers/Suns big man for setting “dirty’’ picks.\n“All tables, stanchions and what appears to be immovable objects should get out of the way when he gets scored on,’’ Derek Fisher said Wednesday after the second day of Knicks practices at West Point. “Guy scores on him and things don’t go well, he tends to let everyone know he’s not happy. Just having a guy with that type of mindset protecting the basket for you, we hope to be a good thing.’’\nThe wild-haired 7-footer admits his fiery side extends even to training-camp drills. Knicks president Phil Jackson, after losing out on bigs Marc Gasol, LaMarcus Aldridge, DeAndre Jordan and Greg Monroe, went all in on Lopez as his defensive consolation prize — signing him to a whopping four-year, $54 million contract in July.\n“I go after the back of the basket pretty fiercely,’’ Lopez said. “It’s padded so I know it’s safe.’’\nAnthony had hoped the Knicks would land a star, an offense-first big-man — Aldridge was his preference — but he’s likes having Lopez on his side. Jackson believed the Knicks needed a major defensive upgrade and, in revisionist history, has made it seem Lopez always was his preference over the offensive-minded Monroe.\n“He’s big time,’’ Anthony said. “We were winning all the drills today. They took him out and we lost. Goes to tell you right there. It’s good to know as of right now, the way we design our defense, it would be a lot playing around him being an anchor.’’\nAsked how he viewed Lopez in years past, Anthony said, “I hated him as an opponent — a helluva pick-and-roll guy who set crazy screens. I used to think it was dirty, but now I think they are clean.’’\nJackson shipped out defensive-minded center Tyson Chandler after the 2013-14 season and has to hope Lopez makes up for that gaffe. \nAnthony said Lopez has a knack for being aggressive yet not committing fouls.\nHe’s already having an effect on the defensive mentality absent last season when the 17-65 Knicks ranked 27th in opposing field-goal percentage (.460). \nBut Fisher cautions team defense will make the Knicks formidable, not one guy. \n“We can’t just rely on the big hair,’’ Fisher said.\nLopez said he gained an even more frenetic defensive mindset watching former Blazers shooting guard Wesley Matthews. \n“He was a firebrand on that side of the floor,’’ Lopez said. “It’s contagious and will catch on naturally. So far that’s been one of the high points [of camp]. Everyone has such a high level of intensity. That’s wonderful.’’ \nLopez averaged just 9.5 points per game last season (8.2 ppg for his career) and isn’t known for a mid-range shooting touch. But in fairness, there were plenty of other Portland weapons so he got few opportunities. Lopez should get a chance to crack double-figures this season as Jackson’s offense features a low-post big and he gets garbage points from offensive boards.\n“There are a lot of facets of the triangle I can take advantage of,’’ Lopez said. “It does a great job of spacing the floor, getting people in the right spots. It plays to my strengths. I stay around the elbow and blocks. I’m comfortable swinging the ball at the top of the key.’’\nLopez is almost the opposite in style from his twin brother, the Nets’ Brook Lopez, an offensive machine who struggles on defense. The twins live in the same area for the first time since being Stanford teammates. Lopez has a place in Westchester. \n“It’s different than the West Coast,’’ Lopez said. “I’m enjoying it, loving it so far. Venturing to the city, I love how passionate everyone is. It’s called the city that never sleeps. It’s great to see it’s so vivacious, so alive.’’\nJust like his D.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under carmelo anthony ,  derek fisher ,  new york knicks ,  robin lopez", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:21:54.162+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
