ROMERO Associated Press   02, 2015 - 1:05 amLast Updated: October 02, 2015 - 1:06 am   \nPeople: \nArizona (629) \nPHOENIX â€” Welington Castillo had a go-ahead two run double with two out during Arizona's four-run seventh inning that gave the Diamondbacks an 8-6 victory over the Colorado Rockies on Thursday night. \nPhil Gosselin hit an inside-the-park home run for Arizona with two away in the seventh to start Arizona's rally. Replays appeared to show the ball clearing the yellow line on top of the left-field wall and then bouncing back on the field. By the time left fielder Rafael Ynoa retrieved the ball and threw it back toward the infield, Gosselin was headed for home. \nCastillo had his double off reliever Justin Miller (3-3) and scored on two wild pitches by Boone Logan. \nEnrique Burgos (2-2) got the win in relief for the Diamondbacks despite allowing a run on two hits with two wild pitches in the seventh. Silvino Bracho pitched a scoreless ninth for his first major-league save. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:15:24.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
