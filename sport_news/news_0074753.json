They now move on to the knockout round, joining three other MLS teams (L.A., D.C., and Seattle) for the first time in CCL history.\nMore Coverage Real Salt Lake secures Champions League quarterfinal berth with shutout victory Real Salt Lake 's players had a lot on their minds Tuesday as they met CSD Municipal in their final home match, and the final game of their CONCACAF Champion's League group play. A win would put them through to the knockout round. A loss would only add to the disappointment of missing out on Major League Soccer's MSL Cup tournament for the first time in seven years after losing to FC Dallas Saturday 0-1.\nThe first 30 minutes of the game lacked urgency from either team, and both seemed bothered by a slick field. The two teams looked to be waiting for the other to strike first. Real did so in the final minute of the first half when Javier Morales sent a well-targeted corner kick into the box for a wide open Jamison Olave to connect with and drive the header into the back of the net.\nReal Salt Lake didn't score a second goal during the final 45 minutes, but the first was well defended as it held Municipal to a single shot on goal in the second half, which Nick Rimando did well to parry away to keep the clean sheet and send the fans away for the season with some hope for next year.\nHere are the player grades:\nNick Rimando (GK), 10, wasn't tested as much as he might have been. Municipal made its way into the 18 plenty during the first half, it just struggled to get many shots on target. His first real test came on one of Municipal's rare shots on target when Jaime Alas uncorked one from 3 yards out in the 49th minute. His best of the night was a 76th minute blind save as Municipal's Carlos Ruiz sent a wicked bending ball over the wall on a free kick that looked bound for the upper 90. Rimando parried it over the crossbar at the last minute.\nDemar Phillips (DEF), 9 , played quality defense from his left back position. He wasn't called into the attack as much as Tony Beltran, but when he had the chance to go forward he provided quality service and did well to get back to defend against the Municipal counterattack.\nJamison Olave (DEF), 10 , appeared to be defending his Doppelganger much of the night as he marked Municipal's big, physical and fast striker, Johnny Woodly. Olave did well against the effusive Costa Rican goal-scorer. But it was in the 44th minute that he scored one of his own off a Javier Morales corner kick â€” a rather rare sight for RSL these days, but very much appreciated as it ended up being the game winner.\nAaron Maund (DEF), 9 , was steady on the back line but certainly tested by the speedy and physical Municipal attack on several occasions. He seemed caught off-guard at first, but settled in about midway through the first half and finished strong.\nTony Beltran (DEF), 10 , seemed to be the only player for RSL during the opening 15 minutes of play to show much urgency. His offensive work up the right flank was excellent all night, but especially during the first half where his efforts kept RSL in the game until the rest of the team caught up.\nLuke Mulholland (MID), 9 , used his insatiable drive to fill the midfield with defensive energy when much of the rest of the field was lacking as his teammates came up to speed through the first half. Mulholland was one of the reasons RSL weathered a lackluster start to earn the go-ahead goal at the end of the first half and maintain the momentum in the second.\nJavier Morales (MID), 10 , joined Luke Mulholland and Tony Beltran in trying to generate something of a spark throughout much of the first half. He came close to igniting a fire in the 24th minute when a well-positioned free kick went inches wide of an opening in the goal. The second half found the savvy veteran matching tit for tat with Municipal's former MLS player Carlos Ruiz as RSL outlasted Municipal.\nKyle Beckerman (MID), 8 , seemed a little out of sorts to start the game Tuesday night. Whether it was the emotional impact of being out of the playoffs for the first time in seven years or the fourth of a series of exhausting games in 10 days catching up with him, he was just a step slower than usual. He started the second half in much better form. He was quicker on the ball defensively, especially as Municipal wore down. His passes were crisper and he was finally linking up with Javier Morales more consistently.\nJuan Manuel Martinez (FWD), 8 , came into his tenure with RSL hitting the ground running. But Tuesday night he struggled to find his rhythm. The slippery field and physical play from the Municipal defense seemed to temper what began as a promising start. But he weathered the dip and came back to life with about 10 minutes left in the first half. The second half seemed a different game for El Burrito. He wore a different pair of boots and was much more confident on the ball. He made the Municipal defenders look silly as he put on a dribbling and passing clinic in the final third of the field.\nDevon Sandoval (FWD), 7 , was just slightly off his game for the first 25 minutes with poor positioning and errant layoffs. His second half was much better. His layoffs were cleaner and better directed, and he seemed to deal with Municipal's physicality with greater confidence.\nJordan Allen (FWD), 7 , was almost non-existent the entire first half in a role he hasn't played for several months, striker. He struggled the entire half to link up with the midfield and when he did find himself in opportunities to go forward his runs were often too pedestrian. His second half was stronger as he built up a rhythm with the help of Tony Beltran before being subbed out in the 78th minute.\nSebastian Jaime (SUB 78', FWD), 8 , came on for Jordan Allen. He did well to maintain the energey level Allen had finally built up in the second half. He was particularly well-tempered in the face of a frustrated and chippy Municipal team that was particularly angsty in his region of the field.\nJohn Stertzer (SUB 90', MID) , came on for Javier Morales as a time killer. He did not play long enough to earn a grade.\nChris Higbee is a former general manager of DeseretNews.com and continues to write about soccer and the arts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:54:49.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
