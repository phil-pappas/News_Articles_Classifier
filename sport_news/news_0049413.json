He has been mostly lying unconscious, so we shifted him from the Mohali Civil Hospital to the PGI this evening for some advanced tests,” said DSP Navreet Singh Virk. Prabhakar, a permanent resident of the US, was high on drugs when he shot dead his friend Harpreet Singh at Kumbhra Chowk with a country-made revolver in full public view. He was overpowered by the public and handed over to the police. Today, the police could neither record Prabhakar’s statement nor arrest him due to his poor health condition. “He is badly under the influence of some drug and has been lying unconscious since last night. We have shifted him to the PGI for some advanced tests, including brain mapping,” said the DSP. He said Prabhakar’s family members were informed about the entire episode last evening, but nobody had turned up from his side so far. Meanwhile, the police are yet to arrest the two brothers, Tar Singh Bhuttar and Chaudhary Bhuttar, who were accompanying the accused and the victim at the time of the incident. “The brother duo is at large. Our team conducted a raid on their house at Oopli village in Barnala, but it was found locked,” said DSP Virk. The DSP said the prime accused, Prabhakar, was a troublemaker as two or three criminal cases had been registered against him at Barnala before he moved to the US around five years ago. “Prabhakar belonged to a rich family of agriculturists. He also used to run a gym before moving to the US, where he drove a truck. He had got married in the US, but later got a divorce,” he said. Meanwhile, the police handed over Harpreet Singh’s body to his kin after a postmortem. It is yet to be ascertained whether the victim was also under the influence of drugs at the time of the incident. “We have sent his viscera to a laboratory for chemical analysis,” said the police. The police are also trying to find the source from where the youngsters had procured the drugs. “We are waiting for Prabhakar’s condition to improve so that we can proceed in the case,” said the police. Yesterday, Prabhakar had shot dead his friend Harpreet Singh in his temple following a tiff near Kumbhra Chowk at Sector 69 at around 1 pm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:20:58.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
