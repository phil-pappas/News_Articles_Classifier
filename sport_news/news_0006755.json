The San Francisco 49ers then released him. The Raiders signed him five weeks later. \nIn a separate incident, Smith was arrested April 13, 2014, at Los Angeles International Airport. Police said Smith was randomly selected for a secondary screening and became uncooperative with the process, telling a TSA agent that he had a bomb. No charges were filed. \nDuring the 2014 season, he received a nine-game suspension for what the league called violations of its policies on substance abuse and personal conduct. \n__ \nThis story has been corrected that Smith now plays for the Oakland Raiders.
