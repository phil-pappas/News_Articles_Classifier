In addition they had scored 47 goals in 10 games, led by Mikaela Heyboer with 16 goals. And Park Ridge had defeated Cresskill earlier in the season, 5-1. \nBut the Cougars fought hard and lost by only one goal, 2-1. \nThe Owls were seemingly in control in the second half after Nicole Thomas notched her eighth goal of the season by taking a feed from Madeline Clancy and curving a high arching shot that found the upper left corner of the net to make it 2-0 at 21:57. \nCOUGARS SCORE \nThe Cougars (3-5) battled valiantly, however, trimming Park Ridge's lead down to 2-1 with 15 minutes remaining. Owls goalkeeper Kelly McCann failed to corral the ball in the box leading to Lia Choi gathering the ball and calmly burying it in back of the net. \n\"Lia displayed grit and determination on the goal she scored,\" said Cresskill head coach Brian Haines. \nCresskill would be unable to tie the game as the Park Ridge defense put the clamps down on the passing lanes the rest of the way. \n\"We lost 2-1 but in the first game we played them we were down 2-1 at one point and we're right there with them,\" said Haines. \"Our team is very young as we only have two seniors. All these games whether we win or lose helps them gain experience. \n\"We're going through our second part of the season where we play everyone again. The more confidence we have, the results will turn around in our favor. We need a little more hard work and skill but we showed lots of heart and had nothing to lose.\" \nMALTBY STEPS UP \nIn the first half the Owls spent most of the time in the offensive half of the field and Shayna Bohus had a handful of prime scoring opportunities. She shot it wide of net in the 29th minute and less than a minute later she blasted a shot from the right corner but Cougars goalkeeper Julia Maltby made the save. Maltby came up huge again in the 25th minute, stopping a pointblank shot by Bohus. \n\"This is the first year on varsity for Julia (11 saves in the game) and she's done nothing but a fantastic job,\" said Haines. \"Every game she is getting increasingly better with the catching, diving and gaining more confidence.\" \nA breakaway attempt by Cougars junior midfielder Emily Wells was quickly thwarted by the smothering Park Ridge defense. Bohus had another scoring chance in the 12th minute but her shot sailed over the net. In the 11th minute a Claire Perez blast from 20 yards out ringed off the top of the crossbar. \nPark Ridge finally broke through at the 3:45 mark as Callie Bohus fed a pass from the left side of the box to Shayna Bohus, who trapped the ball and chipped a shot from close range into the net to make it 1-0. \n\"We had the ball in their end the entire time but couldn't finish too many,\" said Park Ridge Owls Head Coach Dave Schneider. \"In the end it's a win but they had a nice game plan by marking us well and stopping our big scorer. Nicole (Thomas) has nice power and ability to score from 25 to 30 yards out plus she is the fastest kid on the team.\" \nEmail: baumuller@northjersey.com Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:40:27.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
