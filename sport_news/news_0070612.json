(AJ Reynolds/Staff, @ajreynoldsphoto) Mark Richt on magnitude of Florida game, twist on Jacksonville trip and more By Marc Weiszer updated Sunday, October 25, 2015 - 6:25pm close \nMark Richt went from the sidelines to couch on Saturday during Georgia’s off weekend. \n“I was a good college fan yesterday,” the Bulldogs coach said during his regular Sunday evening teleconference. \nHe said he saw a “good bit,” of Alabama’s 19-14 win over Tennessee including the end of the game. \nThat ensured that Georgia controls its path to the SEC championship game. \nIf it beats Florida, Kentucky and Auburn, the Bulldogs will go. \nGeorgia plays No. 11 Florida Saturday. The Gators are 4-1 in the SEC and Georgia is 3-2. \n“Yeah, it’s a big game certainly,” Richt said. “We think they’re all big. Certainly this one is one that everyone gets excited about regardless of the record but it has a lot of meaning when it comes to the Eastern Division race as well.” \nSome other items coming out of the call: \n--One twist on the annual trip to Jacksonville. Georgia is flying down on Thursday for what Richt said was the first time. There are no classes on Friday. \n“We thought we could get in there and let them get a good night’s sleep,” he said. “Even sleep in a little bit on Friday and get into our routine like we normally would have on a Friday. We thought we’d give that a shot and see how that worked.” \n--On backup quarterback Brice Ramsey not playing the past two games: \n“You have thoughts going into the game, but you’ve got to play it out. We’ll have a good plan going into the game on how we want to handle our personnel across the board. If things go as plan we can make the substitutions that we thought we might. Sometimes you just don’t because how a game gets played out sometimes.” \n--Asked about the change in Florida’s offense from suspended quarterback Will Grier to Treon Harris: \n“It’s not a huge difference,” he said. “Grier was actually a very mobile quarterback as well. He made a lot of plays on the move. They do a good job of moving the point on where the quarterback sets. They just don’t always have them in the pocket in the same spot. They’ll move him through bootlegs and nakeds and sprintouts and things of that nature and they’ll sit in there and fire away as well. We’re seeing a lot of the same types of thoughts, but Treon is obviously a very athletic guy and has made a lot of plays on the move throwing and running.” \n--With players not due back from the three-day weekend until tonight, there were no injury updates. \nHe was asked about wide receiver Isaiah McKenzie (hamstring) and outside linebacker Jordan Jenkins (hip strain). \n“I don’t have an updated feeling on these guys that you just mentioned,” he said. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:10:04.200+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
