He took home the league's Defensive Player of the Year award while with the Pacers back in 2004, and you can have a shot at winning that trophy by entering a raffle which he hopes will raise an additional $2 million for family programs.\n\" Family Defense coming soon on xceluniversity.com,\" he posted to his Instagram page. \"Join in and support. My ring raffle raised $671K for mental health awareness. My goal is to raise $2m to bring awareness and support programs focused on strong families.\"\nWorld Peace is in training camp with the Lakers , and will find out whether or not he makes the team's 15-man roster later this afternoon when final cuts are announced. He played in China last season, and did so in some very interesting panda-head sneakers .\nSend all complaints, compliments, and tips to sportstips@complex.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:23:49.194+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
