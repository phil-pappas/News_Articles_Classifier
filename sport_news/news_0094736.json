It was a little extra motivation that the second-ranked Raiders probably didn’t need, but they used it anyway, scoring 21 points in the first quarter and two defensive touchdowns in the fourth on their way to a 63-21 win over the Coyotes, Saturday at Raider Stadium. The victory was SOU’s sixth in a row since a season-opening loss, improving the Raiders to 6-1 overall and 6-1 in the Frontier Conference, tied with 13th-ranked Montana Tech for first in the league standings. The Raiders travel to Billings, Mont., to play Rocky Mountain next week, then return home for a showdown with Montana Tech that could decide the Frontier Conference championship. Coming off back-to-back overtime wins, the Raiders looked determined to avoid a third straight nail-biter Saturday, marching right down the field on their first possession, taking advantage of a fumble and a short field on their second and orchestrating a quick scoring drive to make it 21-0 with still 6:38 to go in the opening quarter. Melvin Mason ran in from the 5 to finish the 76-yard opening drive, and receiver Jeremy Scottow passed 39 yards to Teran Togia to make it 20-0. In between, College of Idaho kickoff returner Grant Darrington fumbled and it was recovered by SOU linebacker Oshay Dunmore at the Yotes’ 17. Two plays later, Sean Tow scored on a 10-yard run. Scottow, a former North Medford player, couldn’t wait to get a chance to throw the ball. “We’ve been working on it (in practice) so many times,” he said, “and I knew we were going to call the play eventually. So it was really cool to have that play call, and I had confidence in my receivers. We’ve just run it so many times it was just like in practice — it was as easy as that.” And especially satisfying, Scottow said, because it came against a team that “talked a little trash” following SOU’s 42-27 win in Caldwell, Idaho on Sept. 19. The Raiders, said Scottow, felt slighted by comments made by College of Idaho head coach Mike Moroski after that game. The comments were printed in an Idaho newspaper game story, and on Saturday they were copied onto a dry-erase board in the Raider locker room. “And so we really took that to heart,” Scottow said. “So we were like, let’s just shut them up. We really just wanted to …say hey, we’re ranked No. 2 for a reason. We’re the reigning national champions for a reason.” Tanner Trosin’s 27-yard touchdown pass to Togia midway through the second quarter made it 27-0. Togia finished with five catches for 103 yards and three touchdowns. Trosin also played well, completing 15 of 20 passes for 168 yards and two touchdowns and no interceptions, and rushing for a team-high 83 yards and another score. Yotes’ quarterback Teejay Gordon’s 14-yard touchdown run with 20 seconds to go in the first half — capped by a flying leap across the goal line — cut SOU’s lead to 28-7 after the point-after kick, but the Raiders scored two more touchdowns in the third quarter to put the game out of reach. Later, Southern Oregon added two of its best defensive highlights of the season for good measure. On the first, Raider linebacker Devvon Gage stripped Gordon deep in SOU territory and safety Julius Rucker picked it up at the 6 and ran it all the way back for a 94-yard touchdown. Rucker showed flashes of the elusiveness that made him a dual-threat quarterback at Westview High School, directing blockers while weaving into the open field then sprinting away from everybody. “I just saw blockers ahead of me and picked up the ball and made a play,” he said. “I almost ran out of gas.” Inside the final minute, SOU’s defense struck again. College of Idaho’s A.J. Martin was stripped by SOU’s Sam Woods, and linebacker Kevin Blueford Jr. scooped it up and chugged 43 yards for the final score. College of Idaho gained 369 yards of total offense but sabotaged its chances at an upset by fumbling five times (SOU recovered four). The Raider defense also had three sacks and limited Gordon to 113 yards passing. Gordon rushed for 103 yards and a touchdown. Southern Oregon gained 499 yards of total offense and was at its best when the pressure was on, converting 10 of 12 third downs and scoring on four of its five red-zone trips. It also avoided racking up costly turnovers, which has been an area of emphasis. Third-string quarterback Jack Singler’s meaningless, fourth-quarter interception was the team’s only giveaway. “We kept the ball in our hands,” SOU offensive coordinator Ken Fasnacht said. “We go at tempo and once you get the first first down and we get moving the football, if we can keep it we can try to wear some teams out, and I think that was evident today. We just improved and played very good football today.” By Joe Zavala", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:53:02.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
