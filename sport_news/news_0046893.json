The former Ohio State and Oakland raiders quarterback initially made the Browns' roster as a wide receiver despite not catching a pass during the preseason. Ron Schwane AP i \nmbarrows@sacbee.com \nSANTA CLARA -- Terrelle Pryor, who once played quarterback for the Raiders but who recently converted to wide receiver, is working out for the 49ers today. A league source said the workout will be conducted with Pryor playing wide receiver. The NFL Network first reported the visit. \nThe 49ers have just one injury at receiver -- Quinton Patton was being evaluated for a concussion on Sunday -- and Jerome Simpson's suspension is set to end in two weeks. The team's issue on offense instead has been at quarterback where Colin Kaepernick has struggled badly in the last two games, completing 22 of 44 passes with five interceptions and no touchdown passes. The 49ers average 12 points a game, the lowest in the league. \nPryor last played quarterback in a regular-season game in 2013 when he was with the Raiders. The former Ohio State passer played in 11 games that season, completed 57.4 percent of his passes for 1,798 yards and threw seven touchdowns and 11 interceptions. \nHe did not play in 2014 and early in 2015 decided to switch positions. He was signed by the Browns but was on the field for only 17 snaps in the preseason due to a hamstring injury. Despite not catching a pass in the preseason, Pryor initially made Cleveland's 53-man squad before being cut. \nThe 49ers have just two quarterbacks on their 53-man roster, Kaepernick and Blaine Gabbert. Rookie Dylan Thompson is on the practice squad. \nMatt Barrows: @mattbarrows , read more about the team at sacbee.com/sf49ers .
