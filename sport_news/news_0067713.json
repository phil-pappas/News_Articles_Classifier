(AP) - The University of Michigan's solar car team is working with IBM on its entry to the Bridgestone World Solar Challenge in Australia.\nThe 1,800-mile race starts Sunday in and the Ann Arbor school says the team is bringing along solar energy forecasting technology from Armonk, New York-based International Business Machines Inc.\nThe forecasting system was originally developed for electric utilities to help them deal with the availability of power from solar and wind sources that change with the weather.\nIBM says the system will offer real-time insights into conditions such as cloud cover and wind patterns as well as help to determine how much solar power will be available to power the car.\nOnline:\nhttp://dme.engin.umich.edu/solarcar25\n ", "external_links": ["http://dme.engin.umich.edu/solarcar25"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:48:20.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
