The first of those sacks came on third-and-8 after the Mean Green reached the Southern Miss 22. Trevor Moore pushed a 42-yard field goal wide right on the next play.\nUNT starting safety Kishawn McClain didn't arrive in Hattiesburg for Saturday's game until two hours before kickoff after attending his grandmother's funeral in Texas. McClain entered the night with a team-high 35 tackles.\nAnthony Wallace made his second straight start at middle linebacker in place of Blake Bean, who missed UNT's loss to Iowa last week due to injury.\nUNT had multiple quarterbacks throw passes for the second straight week. The Mean Green have started Andrew McNulty in all four of their games this season. UNT used both Josh Greer and DaMarcus Smith in a loss to Iowa. Smith came on in the first half of the Mean Green's game against Southern Miss. He threw a 61-yard pass to Carlos Harris on first play of his second series. That was Smith's only completion in six attempts in the first half.\nUNT came into its game against Southern Miss having lost eight straight road games. The Mean Green didn't win a road game last season, going 0-6.\nOn Twitter:\n @brettvito", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/brettvito"], "published": "2015-10-04T05:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:28:07.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
