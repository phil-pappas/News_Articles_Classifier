These are good people and they didn't deserve this.\"\nThe attacker fled the scene with the woman with the bad ankle, said Jones, who didn't know their relationship.\nHe said the Adams and Rojas suffered \"horrific\" wounds and came \"within inches of dying\" but managed to drive themselves to a hospital, where they underwent surgery and were listed in stable condition.\nDr. Padraic Sweeny, of Detroit Receiving Hospital, said he expects them to recover.\nEMT union leader Joe Barney said Adams and Rojas need prayers.\n\"There's probably going to be a lengthy recovery. In some cases, they may not be normal again,\" said Barney, fighting back tears.\nDuggan said EMTs deserve \"every possible tool for their protection,\" although he didn't elaborate. Jones said he's talking with police about ways to better protect first responders.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
