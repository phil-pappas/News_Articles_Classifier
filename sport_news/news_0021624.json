Kotoko goalkeeper Ofori Antwi eyes move to Aduana - www.allsports.com.gh \nEric Ofori Antwi has given Aduana Stars the green light to negotiate with Kumasi Asante Kotoko for his possible transfer to Aduana Stars, following the arrival of Ernest Sowah. \nThe Black Stars goalkeeper on Thursday sealed a three year deal with Asante Kotoko as a free agent, after terminating his contract with Don Bosco of Congo Kinshasa. \nHe has added up to the rich goalkeeping department of the Porcupine Warriors, but Eric Ofori Antwi who managed to beat off competition from Joseph Addo and Isaac Amoako last season thinks a move from the Kumasi based side would give him more playing time than a stay. \n'Aduana Stars have started talking to me, but I have told them to speak to Kotoko because I have a contract with them. \n'If Kotoko give me the go ahead, I will join Aduana Stars, but it is not due to the arrival of Ernest Sowah, because I am not afraid of his presence at Kotoko; last season I met a stiffer competition in the club, but at the end I emerged as the number. \n'However, as a player immediately you sit on the bench it affects your performance'. \nEric Ofori Antwi joined Kotoko from Amidaus Professionals last season and sealed a 3-year deal with the Porcupine Warriors, so his contract will run out in 2017. \nFor more sports news visit allSports.com.gh", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:01:32.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
