The flag likely was in celebration of Barstow High School graduate Aaron Sanchez being the winning pitcher in the Blue Jays' 6-3 victory over the Texas Rangers on Wednesday night in the American League Division Series. Sanchez and his teammates will next play the Kansas City Royals in the AL Championship Series, with the winner advancing to the World Series. Game 1 of the ALCS is tonight in Kansas City and will be televised on Fox at 5 p.m. DesertDispatch.com Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 4:54 PM » STAY INFORMED", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:01:59.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
