The expected windy conditions combined with saturated grounds could make trees and power lines more unstable than usual, experts say. \nTrees not typically at risk of falling during strong winds could present a hazard. Downed trees could fall on power lines, knocking out electricity in some areas, and trees and limbs could block roads and traffic. \nThe storm is likely to continue to affect much of western North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia into Sunday night. Motorists are advised to use caution, as the wind advisory can mean driving may be difficult in strong gusts. \nSaturday’s rains brought reports of minimal local flooding, caused by remnants of Hurricane Joaquin. A creek under a Pleasant Road bridge, south of Carowinds Boulevard near Fort Mill, rose over its banks, threatening to reach the roadway. \nYork, Chester and Lancaster counties saw sporadic rainfall – light to moderate in most places. \nS.C. Department of Transportation crews checked bridges, culverts and drainage structures along all routes. The agency reported Saturday afternoon it had deployed more than 1,000 workers across South Carolina. \nHigh-risk areas were the priority and DOT officials said they were prepared to close roads preemptively, if needed, to keep motorists safe. Crews also closely watched ongoing highway construction sites to ensure heavy equipment was secured. Local area fared better than coastal region \nThe weekend rainfall didn’t have as dramatic an effect locally as elsewhere in the state, according to emergency management officials. York, Chester, and Lancaster county authorities said there were few weather-related problems. All reported no injuries or major traffic issues and no substantial property damage. \nStill, those officials pledged to stay on alert until storms pass. \nBy Saturday morning, most of York, Chester and Lancaster counties had received 1 to 1.5 inches of rain over the previous 12 hours, according to the National Weather Service. \nForecasters had warned of the potential for flooding, but Chuck Haynes, director of York County Emergency Management, said there were no flooding issues to speak of. \nHaynes said there were some trees and power lines down in York County, which he said was a normal scenario for storms. Duke Energy reported a few outages just south of Charlotte, in South Carolina. \nChester County emergency officials reported some downed trees but didn’t receive calls about flooding by late afternoon Saturday, said Ed Darby, county emergency planner. Darby said his crews had visited areas in the county that have typically flooded in the past, and they were “holding up pretty good.” \nTeddy Kulmala: 803-329-4082 , @teddy_kulmala \nReport flooding \n▪ To report flooding along roadways, call the state Department of Transportation at 855-467-2368 , or call 911 if it’s a dangerous situation. \n▪ For updates on road conditions around the state, go to scdot.org . \n▪ After you let the authorities know about flooding, please email assignmentdesk@heraldonline.com and let us know so we can help spread the word. \n▪ Please email any photos you might have of local flooding to assignmentdesk@heraldonline.com.
