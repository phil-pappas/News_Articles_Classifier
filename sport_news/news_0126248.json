From The Catch to Dez Bryant's non-catch and from the Ice Bowl to the meltdown to the Heat, North Texans have seen their share of disappointment around Big D. Here are a dozen moments that still haunt area fans.\nNelson Cruz's Game 6 gaffe in 2011 World Series The Rangers, one strike away from a World Series title (twice), come up empty in Game 6. Nelson Cruz misplays David Freese's triple to right field in the ninth inning, allowing the tying runs to score in the bottom of the ninth inning. Texas would take a 9-7 lead in the 10th, only to lose it again, and the game, 10-9, in the 11th. St. Louis went onto win Game 7 the next day.\n- Photo by Michael Ainsworth / DMN\nThe Catch Cowboys fans have seen this painful highlight too many times. San Francisco's Dwight Clark drifting across the back of the end zone to catch a touchdown pass from Joe Montana with less than a minute to play in the 49ers' 28-27 victory over Dallas in the 1981 NFC Championship Game. Montana, rolling to his right, seemed to wait forever before hitting Clark with a pass that traveled more than 20 yards on a play that started at the Dallas 6.\n- File photo\nBad news for 2015 Rangers comes in threes Sam Dyson gives up a three-run shot to Jose Bautista in Game 5 of the 2015 ALDS, but that's not the worst part. Errors on three straight at-bats, including two credited to Elvis Andrus and one that he couldn't save on a throw from Mitch Moreland, lead to the lead-changing 7th- inning homer. The loss was the third straight for the Rangers after taking a 2-0 lead in the series and a 2-0 lead in the game.\n- Photo by Louis DeLuca / DMN\nJackie Smith's Super Bowl XIII drop With the Cowboys trailing the Pittsburgh Steelers, 21-14, in the third quarter of Super Bowl XIII, tight end Smith dropped a third-down pass in the end zone from quarterback Roger Staubach. The Cowboys ended up losing the game by four points, 35-31, and Smith retired before the start of the next season.\n- Photo by AP\nMavericks can't take the Heat The Mavericks seemed to be on their way to their first NBA title in 2006, up two games to none and with a 13-point lead and just six minutes to play in Game 3 against the Miami Heat. But Dwyane Wade rallied the Heat to a Game 3 win and Miami went on to win the next three games, clinching the title with a 95-92 Game 6 win in Dallas.\n- Photo by Smiley Pool / DMN\nDez Bryant's non-catch in Green Bay In an NFC Divisional Playoff in Green Bay, Cowboys receiver Dez Bryant made a miraculous 4th-and-2 in the fourth quarter which appeared to put Dallas in great position for the win. But a challenge from Packers coach Mike McCarthy led to the call being overturned and the Cowboys eventually dropping the game. \"In our judgement he maintained possession but continued to fall and never had another act common to the game,\" referee Gene Steratore said.\n- Photo by Smiley N. Pool / DMN\nOwn goal for all the marbles In its first MLS Cup appearance in 2010, FC Dallas experienced another first ... the first own goal in the history of the league's annual season finale. Defender George John deflected a Macoumba Kandji shot in the second extra-time period over Kevin Hartman for the winning goal giving the Rapids a 2-1 victory.\n- Photo by Harry How / Getty Images\nPackers ice NFL title in Ice Bowl Packers quarterback Bart Starr (15) sneaks across from the 1-yard line to give Green Bay a 21-17 win over Dallas in the second of two straight NFL Championship Games the teams would play. The 1967 title game was played on a frozen field in brutal cold. Packers coach Vince Lombardi chose not to kick a tying field goal on fourth down, instead calling for the sneak that gave the Packers their third straight NFL title.\n- Photo by AP\nKick to the gut in Super Bowl V Colts rookie kicker Jim O'Brien celebrates his winning 32-yard field goal with just seconds left that gave Baltimore a 16-13 win over the Cowboys, who couldn't quite shake their label as a team that couldn't win the big one. (They did the next year). The game was marred by 11 turnovers, a controversial fumble-recovery call and led a frustrated Bob Lilly to sling his helmet about 30 yards in the air.\n- Photo by AP\nTony Romo's no-no in Seattle Tony Romo's fumble on a field-goal try with 1:19 left in Dallas' 21-20 wild-card loss to Seattle in 2006. With Martin Gramatica set to give the Cowboys their first playoff victory in years with a 19-yard field goal, Romo failed to handle the snap from center. Making the play even more painful was Romo's scramble that ended up just one yard short of a drive-saving first down.\n- Photo by AP\nOusted by the 8 seed in 2007 A year after their collapse in the NBA Finals in 2006, the Mavericks posted the league's best regular-season record (67-15). Then they went out and became the first No. 1 seed to lose to an 8 seed in a seven-game series. Making things worse for Mavs owner Mark Cuban was the fact that Golden State was guided by former Mavericks coach Don Nelson.\n- File photo\nPackers pick off Cowboys' first title chance The 1966 NFL Championship Game, the first of two classics between the Cowboys and Packers, was played at the Cotton Bowl. Don Meredith rallied the Cowboys to within a touchdown but his pass into the end zone on fourth down late in the fourth quarter was intercepted by Tom Brown, preserving a 34-27 win for Jim Taylor (pictured with ball) and Green Bay. Otherwise, the Cowboys may have been in Super Bowl I.\n- Photo by AP\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW"], "published": "2015-10-15T07:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:26:42.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
