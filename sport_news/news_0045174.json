Show Caption Previous Next \nBill Skinner, the 1970 NCAA javelin champion and possessor of the most famous mustache in University of Tennessee athletic history, left behind several fascinating stories from his time as a Volunteer. He died early Monday morning at his home in Georgetown, Ky., from a determined two-month battle with pancreatic cancer. He was 75. \nMr. Skinner was a national champion in the javelin while at Tennessee and during his career defeated two Olympic champions in their home countries. \nAt 6-foot-7, 250 pounds, Mr. Skinner was an imposing figure on campus, whether throwing the javelin or helping keep Tennessee basketball coach Ray Mears a respectable distance from opposing fans at various SEC venues. \n\"I met Bill when I was a freshman at UT in 1969,\" said Bill Chisholm, a Tennessee track letterman from 1970-72. \"One day, I walked onto the track and engaged in a conversation with Bill and told him I had thrown in high school. He told me that I should try out for the team. \n\"After watching him throw, I knew there was a huge difference in our abilities, but decided to try out anyway. After a few minutes, he told me to pick up some training gear. I was on the team and a friend of Bill's for the next 46 years. Even though I could never match him in throwing ability, he always took the time to work with me.\" \nA Wilmington, Del., native, Mr. Skinner lettered at Tennessee from 1968-70 after a circuitous route that took him to Knoxville for the Dogwood Relays in 1967, to Miami for the Orange Bowl meet in 1967-68, back to Knoxville for a look-see at the campus and a meeting with track coack Chuck Rohe, and then back to Delaware. He returned to Knoxville in 1968 and enrolled in school, just a few months short of his 29th birthday. \nHe took second at the NCAA Championships in 1969 with a distance of 273 feet, 3 inches and won the NCAA title in 1970 with a distance of 270 feet, 8 inches. \nIn 1970, he swept the NCAA, AAU and USTFF titles. Skinner set the Tennessee javelin record of 291 feet, 10 inches, in 1970. His best throw that year was 291-9½ at a meet in Germany and was the fifth-best mark in the world. \nHe earned a bachelor's degree in industrial education with honors from Tennessee in 1971. \nMr. Skinner joined the United States Navy at age 17 and toured the world aboard the U.S.S. Canberra. He played semi-pro football with the Delaware Clippers, was an amateur boxer, and worked as a sheet metal worker. \nChallenged by his friend Bill Reader, who threw the javelin competitively, Mr. Skinner picked up a javelin and lost a close contest to Reader at the state AAU championship. Days later, he won the Middle Atlantic AAU title with a toss of 208-10. \nOne legendary Mr. Skinner story happened before a late 1960s Tennessee-Vanderbilt game at Memorial Gym in Nashville, when the Vols warmed up with an orange and white basketball. \nSomehow, the ball found its way toward the Vanderbilt student section, where Commodore students grabbed it and began playing keep-away, part of the ambience of the contests between the two heated rivals. \nAccording to Bud Ford, part of the Tennessee traveling party in those days, Mr. Skinner, resplendent in an orange blazer, waded into the fray, about \"10 rows up in the stands,\" and held his hand out requesting the ball. That's all it took. The ball came back almost immediately. He definitely had a \"presence.\" \nThen came his mustache, a subject that engendered great controversy within the athletic department and brought the issue to national attention, including a story in Sports Illustrated, June 14, 1971. \nIn a 2013 interview, Mr. Skinner recalled those long-ago days, in the fall of 1970. He had returned to campus with a red handlebar mustache that made him look like Ben Davidson, a defensive end of the Oakland Raiders. \n\"They told me I had to shave. I said, ‘My mustache has nothing to do with my ability to throw the javelin. As far as I'm concerned, my grandfather had a mustache, my father had a mustache, and I'll have a mustache. That's the way it's going to be.' \n\"They said, ‘No, you've got to shave. No UT athlete has a mustache.' \" \n\"They\" were \"Athletic Director Bob Woodruff, head football coach Bill Battle, and the rest of the coaching staff at the University of Tennessee.\" \nSkinner was two years older than Battle and wondered exactly what he had to do with the track team. \n\"He just said, ‘That's our policy.' \" \nMr. Skinner said, forthrightly, \"I'm older than you are, and I'm smart enough to know that if I want to shave, I'll shave. That's the way it will be. \n\"When I stood on the victory stand in Russia with my mustache, I didn't feel un-American or like a hippie,\" said Mr. Skinner, referencing his victory in a 1970 dual meet between the United States and the Soviet Union. \n\"Don't they have anything to be more concerned about,\" he added, \"than playing God over something as mediocre as this?\" \nHe did shave the mustache, but it again came to be a bone of contention sometime in early- to mid-1971. \nThat year, according to delawareonline, his photograph had been on the cover of the NCAA track and field guide, sans mustache. Later, he began to grow the mustache again. \nMr. Skinner didn't compete in the NCAA championships that spring when he refused to shave the mustache, defying team rules, an action that made national headlines. \n\"I grew my mustache, and they told me I had to shave it, and I said, ‘I'm not going to.' '' They said, ‘Well, you won't be on the track team.' I said, ‘Well, that's the way it goes. You know, there's no written rule in the Amateur Athletic Union records that says I can't. There's not even a written policy at the University of Tennessee. \n\"It was a situation where our coaches got together, and they decided what our dress code was going to be. I said, ‘If they got together and said that everybody will shave his head to be on one of the athletic teams, I guess we would have to shave our head. I'm not going to do that. I didn't break any rules. I didn't break any NCAA rule. I think you are really out of the ballpark here on trying to get me to shave, period.' \" \n\"It was just a hardheaded decision on my part, versus them. They had a hard head. It was just like two bulls going at each other. They threw me off the team.\" \nWith the mustache issue and college career consigned to history, he looked to the 1972 Olympics, but fate intervened. \n\"While attempting to make the Olympic team on his own and still residing in Knoxville, Bill was unfortunately attacked at a local restaurant by a group of local residents,\" said Chisholm. \"Bill suffered multiple stab wounds that left him hospitalized with surgical staples in his abdomen. After his long recovery, he attempted to make a comeback to competition, but was unable to successfully do so prior to the Olympics.\" \nMr. Skinner began a career with John Deere Industrial Equipment, eventually moving to Georgetown, where he has lived the past 36 years. He later taught welding at Blackburn Correctional Facility a minimum-security prison in Lexington. \n\"It was the most satisfying job he ever had,\" said his wife, Nelda Skinner. \"He used to get letters from people's mothers. He would try to get them jobs.\" \nHe was a charter member of the Delaware Track & Field Hall of Fame (1994) and a member of the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame (1979). He served as an elder at First Presbyterian Church in Georgetown and was active in the Disabled American Veterans. The Georgetown News-Graphic named him \"Father of the Year\" in 1987. In his obituary, his family said he \"loved westerns, woodworking, chocolate malt whoppers, and Tabasco on everything.\" \nFuneral services are set for 1 p.m. Thursday at First Presbyterian Church, 317 E. Main Street, Georgetown, Rev. Pamela Rucker officiating. Memorials may be made to the Disabled American Veterans (www.dav.org). Copyright 2015 Journal Media Group. All rights reserved.
