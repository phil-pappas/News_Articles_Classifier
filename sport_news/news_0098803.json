(AP) - The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers says boaters should be careful on Arkansas lakes as a drought lowers water levels, and foresters say outdoor burning should be avoided to reduce the risk of wildfires. The Corps said water levels at Lake Greeson, DeGray Lake and Lake Ouachita are falling because of high temperatures, little rainfall and hydroelectric production. Lower water levels expose ridge tops that are typically under water. Engineers encouraged boaters to have a designated lookout while traveling. Meanwhile, more than four-fifths of the state has some form of drought, according to federal monitors. Forecastes say it could be the weekend before parts of Arkansas see a major rainfall. The Arkansas Forestry Commission says southern Arkansas has an \"extreme\" fire danger while northern Arkansas has a high risk. \nMore Links:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:50:19.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
