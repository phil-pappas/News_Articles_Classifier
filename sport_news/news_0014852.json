Now, with Crockett sustaining a groin injury, he has been cast into a World Cup semifinal. Nehe Milner-Skudder has recovered from a shoulder injury sustained during the 62-13 win over France in the quarterfinals and took his place on the right wing in the team named yesterday. Richie McCaw will set a RWC record in captaining his side for the 12th time in the competition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:58:13.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
