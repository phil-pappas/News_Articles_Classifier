Minkah Fitzpatrick and Eddie Jackson combined for three interception returns for touchdowns, and Derrick Henry added two touchdowns of his own. \nIn reviewing the Tide's sixth win of the season, AL.com grades the performance of each position group against the Aggies. \nQuarterbacks: B+ \nIt was a quietly strong performance for Jake Coker against Texas A&M. The gameplan was clearly centered around getting Derrick Henry the ball, but he did what he needed to on other plays. He threw the ball well -- he finished 19 of 25 or 138 yards -- and showed off the grit that's endeared himself to fans on a few scrambles. Coker was actually the Tide's second leading-rusher on Saturday and reiterated after the game he doesn't like sliding. \nRunning backs: A \nDerrick Henry had a career day in the first quarter alone. The 6-foot-3, 242-pound running back had huge holes to work with and he made Texas A&M pay. He didn't have as much to work with in the second half once Ryan Kelly left with an injury , but he still grinded out yards to get Alabama into field goal position to end an Aggies comeback attempt. He finished with a career-high 236 yards and two touchdowns and was a huge reason Alabama won on Saturday. Kenyan Drake wasn't able to be as successful and didn't play much in the second half, finishing with 11 yards on five carries. \nReceivers: B \nIt was a solid yet unspectacular day for the receivers. Calvin Ridley led the way again for Alabama with seven catches for 52 yards. His best play of the day came on a 28-yard catch late in the third quarter. Richard Mullaney was a steady option for Coker and picked up two first downs on his four catches. O.J. Howard had three catches for 35 yards and bested his season-best 17 catches his freshman year. Derek Kief was involved in the weirdest offensive play of the day for the Tide, notching negative-three yards on his first career catch. \nOffensive line: B+ \nThe offensive line seen in the first half deserves an \"A+\". The offensive line was incredible in the first half, making few mistakes and creating huge holes for Henry to run through. Texas A&M had no answer for Alabama's o-line. Alabama wasn't able to dominate that way in the second half, though, in part because Ryan Kelly left the game with a concussion and didn't return. The offense got a little off-rhythm without Kelly and couldn't impose its will as well as it did in the first half. Aggies defensive tackle Daylon Mack started having more success jumping the snap count and blowing through the line in the second half. Still, it was a good day for a unit that didn't fare well a week earlier against Arkansas. \nDefensive line: A \nThe defensive line got the job done as it always does. Jonathan Allen was the star of the show against the Aggies, getting consistent push into the backfield and finishing with two sacks and four tackles for loss. A'Shawn Robinson and Jarran Reed each had a quarterback hurry and combined for a tackle for loss. The defensive line's pressure forced Kyle Allen to make a few bad decisions and the secondary capitalized with three touchdowns. This group also helped limit Aggies running back Tra Carson to only 46 yards. \nLinebackers: A \nAnother strong day from the linebackers against the Aggies on Saturday. The linebackers combined for three sacks, five tackles for loss and 19 total tackles. Reggie Ragland led the way as he usually does with nine tackles, one sack and 1.5 tackles for loss. Tim Williams continued to show why he's a dangerous pass-rusher. Linebackers also deserve credit for limiting Aggies running game and forcing Kevin Sumlin to abandon it early in the game. \nDefensive secondary: A \nAny time you score three defensive touchdowns, you deserve an \"A\" grade. Minkah Fitzpatrick had two pick-sixes and Eddie Jackson took one of his two interceptions 93-yards to score 21 points against the Aggies. That set a new Alabama record for most pick-sixes in a single game. The secondary gave up a few big gains, but that's to be expected when the opposing team throws the ball 45 times . Alabama did a good job overall of limiting explosive plays against a talented receivers group that includes Christian Kirk and Ricky Seals-Jones. \nSpecial teams: D \nSpecial teams is the biggest weakness of this team and it's not even close. Alabama gave up a 68-yard punt return touchdown to Christian Kirk to let the Aggies back into a game it had been dominating. In the third quarter, it got even worse for the Crimson Tide special teams unit. Cornerback Cyrus Jones fumbled a punt return and gave Texas A&M the ball on Alabama's 47-yard line. Later, the Aggies blocked a J.K. Scott punt and recovered on the Tide's 29-yard line. The only thing preventing this from being an \"F\" was Adam Griffith made two field goals in the second half to clinch the win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:23:50.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
