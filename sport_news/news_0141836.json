He was trying to show off.”\nThankfully, no one was hurt and the gun was safely removed from the school.\nAlthough it is not clear how the child obtained the gun, the child’s parents have been arrested and charged with child desertion. The report from the Amite Police Department says \"[Kenisha] was criminally negligent in allowing her child to come into possession of a firearm and take it to school.\"\nKenji Steptoe, 36, and his wife Kenisha Steptoe, 30, were both booked in the Tangipahoa Parish Jail.\nCopyright 2015 WAFB .
