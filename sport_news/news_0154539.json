To make matters worse, our secondary is banged up, Perry is still out and Carrington is going to try to play, but that seems like a tough go. Gump has been working out in the secondary this week in practice, which tells you how short handed we are back there. That doesn't bode well against another explosive team like UCLA, especially with Graham rolling the dice on defense so much. Last week, we held the vaunted USC rushing attack to 79 yards on 32 carries. Of course, it was irrelevant because of all the breakdowns and mistakes we had elsewhere. They will need a strong showing to slow down Perkins. We all know Graham likes to blitz like crazy. Will he be true to form against freshman QB Rosen? I expect that he will and just hope we don't get burned too much as a result. Perhaps he can mix it up a bit. Best case scenario, we get to Rosen and force him to make mistakes like the the BYU game. Worst case scenario, we don't get to him and we get burned by UCLA's speed on the outside. A bright spot for us on D has been true freshman D lineman Jo Jo Wicker. He has been getting sacks, tackles for losses, and even forced a fumble last week. It would be great if he had a big game for us. Russ can clarify, but I heard that UCLA is missing 3 starters on D. Our offense really needs to get on track and I am hoping this is the game where that happens. If we can win the turnover battle by +2, here's my prediction: ASU 34 UCLA 31 UCLA is missing Vanderdoes, Myles Jack and Fabian Moreau and there may be a couple of others nicked up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:16:13.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
