If he wants guys sliding like that into him, then it’s perfectly fine,” David Wright said. “… There’s a thin line between going out there and playing the game hard and going out there trying to get somebody hurt.”\nThat quote and that situation? They’re from 2010 .\nUtley has changed teams — the longtime Phillie is now a Dodger — but his grit and chippiness have remained. After his brutal take-out slide on Saturday in Game 2 of the NLDS that left Ruben Tejada with a broken leg and the Mets reeling and seething, it’s worth revisiting Utley’s past.\nOne player’s dirty play is another’s gutsy play, so it’s hard to make blanket statements about the second baseman, who helped the Dodgers knot the series at 1-1 with a 5-2 win .\nBut it wasn’t even the first time Utley had been blasted for a dangerous slide into Tejada. The slide that set the bar came in 2010, when the Mets shortstop was just a rookie and Utley a Mets-killing Phillie.\n\nWhile it doesn’t have the blindsided element that Saturday’s contained — Tejada caught the ball with his back to the bag, then hadn’t completed his 180 before Utley’s face barged into his knee — the plays look eerily familiar.\nUtley’s basepath pugnacity hasn’t been only directed at the Mets, though. There was the time in 2011, also in the NLDS, when Philadelphia took on the Cardinals. Ryan Theriot played the role of Tejada, but he fortunately was able to rise after this Utley postponed slide.\n\nAnd then the time merely a month ago, against the Padres. Especially notable in this video is the announcer’s tone — he doesn’t regard it as a dirty play, but rather just a mark of grit and gamesmanship.\nVideo of Utley slide in a game a month ago pic.twitter.com/A0FhNRMbp0 \n— Mike Rosenberg (@RosenbergMerc) October 11, 2015 \n\nWill Utley get a chance to take out another Met?
