(AP Photo/Alex Gallardo) Sponsored Links The Associated Press LOS ANGELES â€” \nDaniel Murphy stole an uncovered third base and went on to score the tying run, then hit a go-ahead homer off Zack Greinke to lead the New York Mets over the Los Angeles Dodgers 3-2 Thursday night and into an NL Championship Series matchup with the Chicago Cubs. \nNew York trailed 2-1 in the decisive Game 5 of the NL Division Series when with three infielders on the right side and no one near third, Murphy strolled to second on Lucas Duda's walk and sprinted to third. Travis d'Arnaud followed with a sacrifice fly, and Murphy homered in the sixth. \nJacob deGrom allowed runners in all six of his innings but just two runs. Noah Syndergaard pitched the seventh, and Jeurys Familia got the first six-out save of his career. \nDespite a record $289 million payroll, the Dodgers remained without a World Series title since 1988. Andre Ethier shouted at Dodgers manager Don Mattingly in the dugout in the third.
