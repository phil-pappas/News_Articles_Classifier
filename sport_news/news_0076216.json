I got some good blocking, made a cut, and it was wide open. It was awesome. It’s a defensive dream.”\nWhile scoring a touchdown was rare for the 6-foot-5, 220-pound senior, coming up with the loose ball was old hat for Groves. The Falcons recovered four fumbles and intercepted two passes in the first half, steamrolling the Bears, 47-14, for a homecoming win.\nBoth teams entered undefeated in OAA Blue play, but Groves (7-0, 6-0) left no doubt about who the league’s premier team was.\nTakeaways set the tone. Groves’ defense scored twice and set up two more scores and led, 41-0, after two quarters, when Berkley had more turnovers (six) than first downs (four).\n“Berkley’s a great team but I think it was just us rising to the occasion,” Lazor said. “Our defense is one of the best I’ve ever played on, and it’s a privilege to play with these guys.”\nLeading, 8-0, Jake Zanolli hit Berkley QB Ross Herron as he was throwing, and Simon McCaffrey pounced on it. The turnover led to a 60-yard scoring drive, capped by Earnest Allen’s 14-yard run.\nTwo plays later, an errant shotgun snap went over Herron’s head, and linebacker Nathan Wagner took it into the end zone from 6 yards, making it 22-0.\nBerkley got to midfield on its next drive before sophomore Collin Heard fell on another loose ball.\n“I think that’s deceiving, I really do,” Groves coach Brendan Flaherty said. “We got some good turnovers, and we forced them. If you look at the film, they had us on some outside veer stuff, and they had us on a few things.\n“I think the biggest thing is that we didn’t allow a big play to (Nolan) Givens until the second half. … We tried to have three sets of eyes on him the whole time. He’s 70% of their offense and has something like 12 touchdowns.”\nGivens put the Bears (5-2, 5-1) on the board in the third, busting through the line for a 59-yard run. The Bears also scored late on Chauncey Bridgewater’s 86-yard reception from Justin Flood.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:25:11.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
