Steve Lewis/Durango Herald It took every member of the Bobcats' defense to try to slow down John Mall senior running back Garrett Quintana on Friday in Ignacio. N ot even a power outage in Bobcat Stadium could slow down the John Mall football team. The school from Walsenburg ran all over the Ignacio Bobcats for a 60-0 victory on Ignacio’s homecoming night. The Panthers jumped out to a 12-0 lead in the game’s opening minutes and built a 38-0 lead by halftime, as the Bobcats couldn’t do anything to stop the opposing running game. After halftime, the half the stadium lights went out at the Bobcats’ field, creating a delay. But, after the stoppage, the Panthers continued to pound the football en route to the 60-0 victory. Even a bad snap on an extra point didn’t deter the Panthers, who instead scooped up the ball and ran it in for a two-point conversion. John Mall improved to 3-2 and 1-0 in the 1A Southern Peaks League. Ignacio fell to 0-5 and 0-1 in the league. The Bobcats will look for their first win at 7 p.m. Friday at home against Monte Vista.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:11:06.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
