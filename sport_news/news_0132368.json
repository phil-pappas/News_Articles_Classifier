It obviously didn’t quite work out there but they moved the ball, they scored a lot of points,” Belichick said of Weeden and the Cowboys offense, which put up 28 points in a losing effort to the Falcons in Week 3. “He did a good job of getting the ball to his outlet receivers, used the backs well. They had a lot of production. He’s an experienced player.”\nBelichick also praised the Cowboys offensive line, and the skill players Weeden can utilize in that offense. Even without Romo and wide receiver Dez Bryant , and tight end Jason Witten , who has battled through injury to play, Belichick believes the Cowboys can be a handful for his defense.\n“They have really good backs, a lot of depth in their backfield. I think he’s done a good job of utilizing those guys. They’re a good football team,” Belichick said. “I know they’ve lost a couple key players, but they’ll be getting some more guys back next week, and they’ve got a lot of players to work with. It’s going to be a big challenge for us. They’re very good in the kicking game, tough team defensively, and a lot of explosive players on the offensive side of the ball. It will be tough.”\nTrader Bill\nThe Patriots haven’t been shy when it comes to pulling the trigger on trades during the season.\nIn 2012, the Pats acquired cornerback Aqib Talib . Last year, they brought in help with defensive end Akeem Ayers and linebacker Jonathan Casillas . This year, they’ve added receiver Keyshawn Martin , linebacker Jon Bostic and defensive lineman Akiem Hicks .\n“We haven’t been afraid to trade here through the years whether it’s during the draft, preseason, regular season or whatever it is,” Belichick said. “I don’t think there’s been a conscious effort to avoid ’em, or run to ’em and say ‘We’ve got to do them.’”\nIt’s just worked out the Pats have been pretty active during the season because deals were available. It’s also helped having some players, like Talib for instance, in the final year of a contract.\n“We felt the players we’ve acquired, all those players . . . we thought they would be beneficial for us,” Belichick said. “Some of those guys have. We’ll see how it goes with this new group.”\nOn Wednesday, the Pats sent tight end Michael Hoomanawanui to New Orleans for Hicks.\nBelichick’s take on the massive defensive lineman?\n“He played different spots at New Orleans, anywhere from the center out to 5-technique. We’ll see how that goes here,” Belichick said of Hicks. “He’s a big guy, physical player. We got a good look at him down there. We thought he did some good things.”\nAsked if the emergence of Michael Williams made Hoomanawanui expendable, Belichick said, “(You) had to give something, to get something.” Belichick added Hoomanawanui was “a smart guy. (We) won a lot of games with him.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:06:03.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
