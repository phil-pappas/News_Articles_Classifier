So I can feel good about that. \n“I can look back on a lot of different things that put me in this situation right now, starting with the first two races in this round where we didn’t run well. We got wrecked by (Carl Edwards at Charlotte), and just didn’t run well at Kansas.” \nAs for the new NASCAR rule on green, white, checkered restarts that contributed to his loss at Talladega, Earnhardt didn’t feel any malice towards the sanctioning body. \n“I’m fine with it,” he said. “I feel like no matter the rules, when the race is over, I can live with the result as long as everyone else is going by the same rules. \n“I finished second. I’m OK with that. \n“We could argue they could have waited another hundred feet to throw the caution, but they didn’t have to. \n“They threw it when they needed to. I’m fine with that.” \nEarnhardt said rather than hang his head for the remaining four Chase races, he intends to go out, and like he did last season, win one of them, even if it really won’t count. \n“The best thing that could happen for us is the same thing that happened last year, go win,” he said. We’re disappointed today; we were disappointed last year when we left Talladega. \n“But we went to Martinsville and sort of surprised ourselves with our first win there. \n“Dang, you know, when I look at that video (last year) of all of us jumping up and down on that trailer like idiots, that’s a team that’s not too bothered being knocked out of the Chase right there. \n“If we can go to the racetrack and win, it certainly makes our situation much more bearable. If we could go to Homestead and run well, I’d love to win there. Never won there. I like that track. Running against the wall is a lot of fun. We’ll see.” \nFor his part Logano said he knew that to win at Talladega he would have to defeat one of best big track race car drivers in history in Earnhardt. \n“Obviously he was very fast; he had a very fast race car.” Logano said of Earnhardt. “Could we have held him off? Of course. We were fighting him hard. \n“Would it have been easy? No. It was going to be very challenging. \n“We were racing against the best Speedway racer that we know, right? He’s won a ton of these Speedway races. I look at him as one of the best Speedway racers. \n“To race against him for a win was not going to be easy. But to come out with a checkered flag meant a lot.” \nThe final word goes to Earnhardt. \n“Yeah, I’m glad this weekend’s over with.” \nHarvick may be penalized for crash \nNASCAR may not be finished yet with how the CampingWorld.com 500 ended at Talladega Superspeedway on Sunday. \nThe race was stopped by a caution on the final restart when Kevin Harvick moved up the track in the No. 4 Chevrolet and wrecked the No. 6 Ford of Trevor Bayne. \nThe move allowed Harvick to finish 15th and it also allowed him to advance to the next round of the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup Championship. \nThere is speculation that NASCAR bosses will look further into the situation and penalties to Harvick could be brought down later in the week. \nBayne certainly thought Harvick’s move was intentional. \n“That’s a crappy way for Harvick to have to get in the Chase; to wreck somebody — what I believe to be on purpose” Bayne said. \nAs for Harvick, he said it was just an accident. \n“As I pulled up, I didn’t even see the 6 (Bayne) up there and clipped him and shot him across the inside,” Harvick said. “It sucks, but it worked out.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T22:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:29:15.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
