The Gubernatorial Elections next Saturday could see anywhere from 40 to 50% turnout if history is any indication.”\nVoters can also use the smartphone app GeauxVote Mobile to find out where to vote, what is on their ballot, and their voting district. More information on that app can be found HERE .\nThere are more than 1,000 races taking place statewide, along with four potential constitutional ammendments and 73 propositions.\nMore information on the upcoming election can be found at www.GeauxVote.com , or WAFB's own election headquarters .\nCopyright WAFB 2015.
