However, we believe that we have the right manager to turn this season around and that he has the squad with which to do it. \nMourinho said, following the 3-1 loss to Southampton on Saturday ‘If the club sacks me they sack the best manager this club ever had.” (Here’s the full quote) . Chelsea are off to their worst start in 37 years, a season in which they were relegated. They’re currently hovering just a couple spots above the drop zone. You can best believe that Mourinho will be sacked if the Blues remain there much longer. If Chelsea is eliminated from the group stages of Champions League, that could also potentially lead to Mourinho’s dismissal. \nIt’s rumored that Chelsea Owner Roman Ambramovich has a strained relationship with Mourinho. \nAs the losses mount and Mourinho’s seat warms, the embattled Blues boss has found new and creative ways to publicly express his frustrations. \nPaul M.
