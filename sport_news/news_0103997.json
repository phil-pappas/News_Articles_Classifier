The Indians had a 5-0 record when scoring 33 or more points. Then came last week, when the Tribe managed just 16 points and still came out on top. Well, it happened again. Pontiac hit the same score as last week to pick up its seventh win of the season with a 16-6 victory over Kankakee on Senior Night at Williamson Field. “Senior Night and going up against a very determined Kankakee team, we had to battle for four quarters to pull it out,” PTHS head coach Buck Casson said. “We executed when we needed to.” The Indians got two touchdowns in key moments and did not trail, although the Kays did forge a tie in the first half. The first score of the game came when Levi Ransom raced 20 yards to cap a 61-yard drive. It came on Pontiac’s first possession of the game and took place at 8:21 left in the period. Kankakee tied it up it up with 2:33 to go in the opening period when Lavell Hill rumbled in from the 3-yard line. Like Pontiac’s conversion try, the Kays failed to leave it ay 6-6. This game was about defense, just like last week’s when the Tribe shut down U-High’s tough rushing attack. This time the Indians were able to get pressure and forced some errors by Kankakee. One came with 8:12 to go in the first half when KHS quarterback Malcolm White fumbled and Tim Anderson recovered at the Kays’ 35-yard line. PTHS ran eight plays before being forced to try a field goal. Noah Sandoval was right on from the right hash mark with his 28-yard effort, making it 9-6 with 5:18 left in the half. For the most part, the first half was played in rain. The rain blew through by halftime but the wind was something of a factor as it moved from south to north. It had an affect by the end of the third period. Aided by a 43-yard jaunt from Vaughn Hobart, the Indians drove deep into Kankakee territory. PTHS faced third-and-goal from the 1-yard line but could not break into the end zone. The Indians tried again on fourth down but failed on that try, a Cunningham keeper, as well. This turned the ball over to Kankakee with 2:22 to go in the quarter. The Kays were facing third down at their 16 when Casson called a timeout with 10.5 seconds on the clock. “I was trying to get them to throw into the wind, then if incomplete, punt into the wind,” Casson said of the timeout call. “That worked out better than my plan because we got an interception and a touchdown. I’ll take that.” Page 2 of 2 - White dropped back to pass when play resumed and was pressured into making a desperate and wild throw deep down field. The wind caught the ball and held it up as Cunningham focused on it. Cunningham caught the ball and the Indians had time for one play with the wind from the Kankakee 43. Mikey Carroll raced down the sideline and measured Cunningham’s throw. Carroll snared the pass and out ran the Kankakee defender for a 43-yard touchdown as time ran out in the quarter. “Closing out the third quarter with a touchdown, that was very helpful.” Casson said. “Seth threw a pretty darn good strike and Mikey working off (the defender) to go get that touchdown.” Sandoval kicked the extra point and PTHS led 16-6 as the fourth quarter got underway. Pontiac’s defense did its job in the final frame, limiting Kankakee to just seven plays from scrimmage. The offense then went into clock-eating mode and got its fill. “We were solid on defense and got our offense into some good field position,” Casson said. “We were able to control the clock and shorten that fourth quarter.” The Indians took 4:53 off the clock on their first possession. They drove to the 47 before punting. PTHS got the ball back with 3:53 to go after forcing a punt. The Indians ran six plays in running the clock out to improve to 7-2 on the season. Next up is the waiting game to find out who the Tribe faces in the first round of the playoffs and where that game will be played. For the game, the Indians managed 264 yards from scrimmage. Cunningham was 4-11 for 71 yards. Some of those incomplete passes were not the senior QB’s fault. Hobart rushed for 127 yards and Ransom, who did not garner a carry in the second half, had 44 yards. Jake Lanning rushed for 20. The defense came up with three sacks on the night. T.J. Billings recorded 10 tackles. Kankakee (3-6) collected 206 yards of offense.
