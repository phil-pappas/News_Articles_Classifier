Scientists searching for life on other planets have made a startling discovery about how planets die.\nAstrophysicists using the Kepler Space Telescope to observe a dead star in the Virgo constellation are seeing what happens when a white dwarf consumes nearby planets - a long-theorized, but never-before-seen, phenomenon that could be a glimpse into Earth's own future.\n\"(This gives us an) idea what will happen to all solar systems,\" study author Andrew Vanderburg of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics told the Daily News.\nThe rocky object being destroyed is a minor planet similar in size to Ceres, a dwarf planet that lies between Mars and Jupiter on the asteroid belt.\nThe planet is being demolished by a white dwarf- the leftover core of a star that has run out of hydrogen fuel.\nÂ© NASA NASA / Reuters/REUTERS Kepler space telescope showed a white dwarf ripping apart a planet. The white dwarf's gravity ripped the minor planet into pieces that continue to rotate around the dead star.\nNow, the star's heat is vaporizing the remains into dust and gas that the star absorbs.\nThis discovery foreshadows a possible future for Earth.\nIn 6 billion years, the sun will run out of hydrogen, expand and engulf Mercury and Venus, Vanderburg said.\nIf Earth remains intact, it may be pushed into the gravitational pull of the white dwarf and be savaged anyway, Vanderburg said.\nlcouillard@nydailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:54:00.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
