Moorestown advanced with a defeat of South Jersey winner Mainland Regional High School in this morning's other semifinal. \nStephanie Schrage staked Millburn to a 1-0 lead with a 6-0, 6-0 win at first singles against Madison Hite. \nAlex Pritsker made the score 2-0 with a 6-0, 6-1 defeat of Charlotte Hagan at second singles. \nThe second doubles team of Elizabeth Gray and Anna Mandel provided the match clinching point. \nGray and Mandel defeated Gabi Tantillo and Anna Rimland 6-2, 6-2. \nIsabella Waung and Sydney Zirlin extended the lead to 4-0 with a 6-1, 6-3 defeat of Chloe Decker and Sarah Apsey at first doubles. \nJoanna Atwater completed the shutout with a 6-2, 6-3 defeat of Emily Hite at third singles. \nThe Millers are seeking to claim a 10th straight group crown and move within one of Red Bank Catholic High School's state record for consecutive group titles. \nMillburn reeled off six straight Group 3 crowns from 2006 through 2011. The Millers, after moving up a group, claimed Group 4 crowns in 2012 and 2013. \nThe Millers capped a return to Group 3 last season with a defeat of Princeton High School in the title match. \nEmail: connellyj@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:28:04.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
