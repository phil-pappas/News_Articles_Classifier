Modi would address rallies in Bihar tomorrow and again on October 16 — the voting days for the first and second phase. The grand alliance petitioned the EC that allowing the telecast when people would be casting their vote is tantamount to an “attempt to influence the voters”. Though the rallies would be held in constituencies other than those going to polls that day, the grand alliance leaders, including KC Tyagi and Pawan Verma of the JD(U), Manoj Jha of the RJD and Ajay Maken of the Congress, alleged the events would deprive them of a level playing field. They have demanded that the BJP be told not to organise PM’s rallies 48 hours ahead of polling. The leaders alleged the PM's October 12 and 16 rallies had the potential to influence one-third of the voters as 81 constituencies across 16 Bihar districts would be going to the polls on these dates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:10:34.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
