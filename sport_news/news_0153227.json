Lucky for the Broncos, they will be facing the No. 31 ranked Browns' run defense. If C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman can't run on Cleveland's defense, they might never be able to run. The Browns also have given up a league-high three runs of over 40 yards. Edge: Broncos\nWhen the Browns run The Broncos have given up only 85.2 rushing yards per game, fifth best in the NFL. Cleveland, on the otherhand, is the fifth worst rushing team in the league averaging 88.4 yards per game. Isaiah Crowell and Duke Johnson carry the load for the Browns. Crowell is the physical feature back similar to Anderson. Johnson is a quick, elusive runner who excels catching passes out of the backfield, sort of like Hillman. The Broncos should have little problem stopping them. Edge: Broncos\nWhen the Broncos pass The Browns are a middle-of-the-road pass defense, but they'll likely be without No. 1 cornerback Joe Haden Sunday. They have two solid safeties, Tashaun Gipson and Donte Whitner, but nothing receivers Emmanuel Sanders and Demaryius Thomas can't exploit. It's up to Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning to take care of the football, turnovers are one of the things that can let a team like Cleveland stick around in this one. Edge: Broncos\nWhen the Browns pass Josh McCown is fresh off throwing for a franchise-record 457 yards Sunday in a victory over the Ravens. He's more than willing to take some shots deep to his small, yet quick receivers. The Browns offensive line had given up 13 sacks in the past three games, which doesn't bode well for them this week. The Broncos have an NFL-leading 22 sacks by 11 players.
