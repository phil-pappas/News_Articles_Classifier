The ones would go against the ones and the two's on two's. Gary was a rookie and a backup and I was a backup quarterback, so Gary and I got to throw together then. So, I've always been a fan of his -- just his work ethic, the way he approaches the game and his abilities. \n\"You get it in his cylinder and Gary's going to catch the ball. He proved that the other day. That was a huge catch for us in the game. He just, the more were putting the ball his way, the more plays he's making and that's a huge asset for any offense. You look at the productive offenses in the league right now, there's a guy in the middle that's making plays for that team, whoever it is. Gary is emerging for us and helping us do that, and that's going to be big for us.\" \nLate in Sunday's loss to the Chargers, McCown delivered a one-yard touchdown pass to Barnidge and then, found wide receiver Taylor Gabriel with a slant pass on the ensuing two-point conversion to draw the team even with San Diego with 2:09 to play in regulation. \n\"I t was just a quick sprint out, and especially when you're inside the one, it's about completing the ball,\" McCown said. \"If we can gain a step with the moment, like Gary did, it's just about completing the ball, and so, I was able to fire one in there. You have to throw it really hard and trust the guy's going to catch it. \n\"Obviously, with Gary, you know that's going to be a catch, and kind of the same thing, different scenario, but same thing with Gabe on the two-point conversion. I feel like we're doing a good job of constructing things in the red zone that are giving us chances to make plays, but we've got to take it even further because some of those obviously came back to bite us. Some of the trips down there and not getting seven really hurt us.\" \nTwo plays before hauling in the touchdown, it was Barnidge who made a catch in tight coverage while falling out of bounds. Barnidge tipped the ball with his right hand and then, corralled it as he fell to the field, but the official on the sideline ruled the pass incomplete. However, the Browns quickly challenged the call. \nA video review showed Barnidge had a knee and his left elbow down in bounds and maintained possession throughout the length of the play, thus causing the officials to overturn the call on the field and put the Browns first-and-goal from inside San Diego's one-yard line. \n\"It's just concentration, just trying to watch the ball wherever it goes,\" Barnidge said. \nAlthough Barnidge was humble about the catch, his fellow players and coaches believe that play was an example of what he does for the Browns. \n\"What I've learned with Gary, and I saw this early in his career in Carolina, if he gets his hands on it, it's probably a catch,\" McCown said. \"I've just learned not to bet against him, and he doesn't drop. I don't know that we've seen him drop very many balls yet, maybe once since I've been here at practice, so we understand that about Gary and the type of player that he is, and that was a huge play in the game.\" \nBrowns coach Mike Pettine added, \"H e's one of those guys that I think goes under the radar, goes unnoticed. Not a big-name guy. I think a lot of people felt that the production from that room was going to drop significantly when we lost Jordan (Cameron) to free agency. Gary, we have a lot of confidence in, made big plays for us last year in few opportunities and that's continued. \n\"He's been very consistent. He's a more than adequate blocker and in the pass game, he has a good understanding of defenses and leverage and how teams are playing him and where the dead spots in the zone are and how to set up a guy who's playing man coverage. He's got good ball skills and knows what to do after the catch. I thought that catch he made in the game was amazing with it getting tipped and sideways, getting his elbow down. We've had some success this year offensively in the pass game. He's a big part of it.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1RAhAnM TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T00:19:31.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
