Jesse Jackson, a friend of Odom's, visited him on Wednesday and said he remained in a coma. \n\"He is in a real difficult situation,\" Jackson told reporters. \"We can only at this time pray for his recovery,\" he said. \nKardashian was by his side along with friends and family, Jackson said. \nOdom's two children from a previous relationship were also with their father, according to E!, a celebrity website and cable television channel. \nIn a news conference on Wednesday, Nye County Sheriff Sharon Wehrly said authorities received an emergency call from panicked brothel staff, reporting that Odom was unconscious and had blood and a white substance coming from his nose and mouth. \nThe staff told authorities that Odom had used cocaine. \n\"They confirmed his usage on Saturday but were unsure if it had continued,\" Wehrly said. \nThe callers said Odom had taken as many as 10 tablets of a herbal sexual enhancement supplement, Wehrly said. \nLove Ranch owner Dennis Hof said during Odom's three-day stay he had taken large amounts of \"herbal Viagra,\" a non-prescription product which can dramatically lower blood pressure and interact with other medications. \nThe former basketball star has been rumored to have struggled with drug use. \nHe split with Kardashian in 2013. Their courtship, wedding and four-year marriage was captured in the television series, \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" and its spinoff, \"Khloe and Lamar.\" \nAccording to E!, which airs the popular Kardashian reality series, the couple signed divorce papers in July but are still legally married until a judge approves them. \nA toxicology report on Odom was not complete, the sheriff's office said on Wednesday. \nKardashian's mother, Kris Jenner, posted a photo of Odom in his Lakers uniform on her Instagram account late Wednesday, asking fans to \"please pray for Lamar #ourfighter.\" Khloe Kardashian's ex-husband found unresponsive at brothel 1 of Lamar Odom, NBA star player, was hospitalised in Las Vegas.
