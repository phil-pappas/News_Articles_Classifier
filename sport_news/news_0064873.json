(Photo: Tony Ding, Associated Press) \nFast facts \nMatchup: Indiana (4-3, 0-3 Big Ten) at No. 7 Michigan State (7-0, 3-0). \nWhen: 3:30 p.m. Saturday. \nWhere: Spartan Stadium, East Lansing. \nTV/radio: ABC (Channel 7 in Detroit), WJR-AM (760). \nLine: Spartans by 16. \nInjury report \nIndiana: RB Jordan Howard (ankle), questionable; QB Zander Diamont (shoulder), questionable. \nMSU: LB Ed Davis (knee), out for season; CB Vayante Copeland (fractured vertebra), out for season; S RJ Williamson (biceps), out; RB Madre London (lower body), questionable; C Jack Allen (ankle), questionable; CB Darian Hicks (head), questionable; LB Drake Martinez (lower body), questionable. \nMichigan State's Shilique Calhoun (89), Malik McDowell (4) and Lawrence Thomas pursue the ball against Central Michigan. (Photo: Al Goldis, Associated Press) \nFive things to watch \nFree Press sports writer Joe Rexrode breaks down five story lines to watch in Saturday's game: \nThe race heats up: The Spartans remain on track to compete for Big Ten and national titles, and Saturday is the first of three games they must win to set up a mammoth matchup Nov. 21 at No. 1 Ohio State. MSU gets next week off to rest, then travels to Nebraska on Nov. 7 and hosts Maryland on Nov. 14. \nMoving past the 'miracle': However you want to characterize the final play to beat Michigan, it created a tidal wave of emotion and attention for the Spartans. The reality of a championship pursuit with no room for error returns Saturday against a dangerous opponent. MSU players insisted this week they weren’t lingering on the win. \nPost-Michigan blues? Along with his 7-2 record against Michigan, Mark Dantonio has been able to get his team to play well in the game following the U-M game. The Spartans are 7-1 under Dantonio in the game following the Wolverines, the lone loss coming last year. And Ohio State was simply better in a 49-37 win. \nSloppy favors Sparty: The forecast is calling for rain, including several hours of it before the game to potentially create a sloppy field. If weather takes away the sharpness of both teams’ passing attacks, MSU should be better-equipped to line up and run the ball with power, while stopping the Hoosiers from running effectively. \nStreaks alive : MSU’s 11-game winning streak equals the longest under Dantonio – the first one came in the final 10 games of the 2013 season and 2014 opener – and the fourth-longest in school history. It’s also the fourth-longest active streak in the nation. MSU has won 20 of its past 21 Big Ten games, 16 of them by double digits. \nIndiana's Nate Sudfeld (7) throws during the first half of an NCAA college football game against Ohio State, Saturday, Oct. 3, 2015 in Bloomington, Ind. (Photo: Darron Cummings, Associated Press) \nKnow the foe \nRexrode looks at three story lines surrounding the Hoosiers: \nThe other cleat drops: Just when it looked like things were different … an Indiana team that started the season 4-0 is now 4-3 after a disastrous 55-52 home loss to Rutgers. The Scarlet Knights scored the final 28 points amid a mess of Indiana mistakes, and a fan base that was starting to get excited for something other than basketball is on the case of coach Kevin Wilson again. But if the Hoosiers can keep it together emotionally, they should be able to reach the program’s first bowl game since 2007. This team took Ohio State to the limit before losing 34-27, and a 29-7 loss to Penn State came without starting quarterback Nate Sudfeld. \nMVP by a long shot: Sudfeld has missed six quarters of action this season with an ankle injury, and they’re by far the worst six quarters of football the Hoosiers have played. There may not be another player in the Big Ten more important to his team. He leads the Big Ten in passing yards per game (290.2), yards per completion (14.6), yards per attempt (9.2), passing efficiency (156.4) and total offense (295.7). He’s not much of a runner, so the Spartans will try to get at him, but he usually releases the ball quickly and with accuracy. Sudfeld is on pace to hold all major IU passing records by the end of the season. \nGiving a spit: For the 57th time, the Hoosiers and Spartans will play for the Old Brass Spittoon, which came from one of Michigan’s earliest trading posts and is believed to be nearly 190 years old. Since 1950, when the trophy was introduced to the series, the Spartans lead 44-12-1. Overall, MSU leads the series 44-15-2. That includes a 23-6-1 record in East Lansing. Dantonio is 6-0 against the Hoosiers as MSU’s head coach, 3-0 home and away. Most of those have been comfortable, but MSU had to roar back to win 31-27 at IU in 2012, and had to outscore the Hoosiers 42-28 at home two years ago. Indiana writer: Quarterback gives Hoosiers a chance \nJoe Rexrode’s scouting report \nWhen MSU has the ball: Connor Cook and his receivers are on a roll and his protection is getting healthier, though senior center Jack Allen (ankle) would have to make quite a recovery to avoid missing his second straight game. MSU will try to re-spark its running game against an IU team that ranks last in the league in total defense (504.1 yards per game allowed) and scoring defense (35.1 points per game allowed). The Hoosiers have been successfully aggressive, though, collecting 17 sacks and ranking second in the league with 13 takeaways. Selling out to stop the run and get after Cook seems likely. \nWhen Indiana has the ball: When Sudfeld is right, he can complete passes, move the ball and score points on any defense. He has mastered IU’s high-tempo offense and should be able to get the Hoosiers into the red zone frequently. That’s where MSU’s defense has to force field goals. And it has to get enough heat on Sudfeld despite his quick drops and throws to slow down the momentum. Indiana standout back Jordan Howard (ankle) is an uncertainty, but Devine Redding can play. MSU’s pre-snap communication, coverage and open-field tackling all will be tested thoroughly Saturday. \nPrediction: MSU 40, Indiana 27. To be clear, Indiana isn’t just a threat to make this game interesting. The Hoosiers can come into Spartan Stadium and win, if the Spartans aren’t completely on their game and Sudfeld brings his best. But the MSU passing attack that moved the ball on a tough Michigan defense, in tandem with a running game that should find more room against the Hoosiers, will prevail. That’s how it has to be for MSU moving forward.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:02:35.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
