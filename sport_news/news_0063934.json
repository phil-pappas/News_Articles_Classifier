I need to make smarter decisions.”\nTravis Wilson\nLOS ANGELES — In the 1983 film “Never Say Never Again,” a rakish James Bond finds himself on the wrong end of a training exercise that sees him knifed in the ribs while freeing a captive. He gets sent to a fitness camp to shape up for a final assignment.\nLater he ends up saving the world from annihilation at the hands of yet another madman.\nDid the USC Trojans write this, or was it just one of their many Movieland screenwriters? Two weeks after firing their coach, their season was on life support and what did they do?\nTook out undefeated Utah, 42-24.\n“Didn’t expect to get punched in the mouth like that,” said Ute linebacker Gionni Paul.\nAfter 11 national championships and six Heisman winners, never assume they can’t pull off one more mission. Few people did, considering the Utes were underdogs even though they were ranked No. 3 nationally going into Saturday’s game.\nThe Utes thought they could conquer the world. The tough part is they ran into a one-man apocalypse, linebacker Cameron Smith, who intercepted three Travis Wilson passes.\n“They played good defense and had lot of great athletes on their team. I need to make smarter decisions,” Wilson said.\nSo where do the Utes go from here? They’re hoping the same place they’ve been eyeing. One loss or none, they remain a contender for the conference title game, which could still mean a playoff berth or Rose Bowl appearance.\n“Our main goal is to win the Pac-12 South and we’re still in the driver’s seat,” receiver Britain Covey said.\nThey rose from being unranked before the season began, to No. 3 in seven weeks.\nUSC? It brings a lot of worries for opponents, even on bad years.\nThe book on the Utes was if you let them play close throughout, they can beat anyone. But get them down early and force them to rush back and it’s a different story. That’s what happened. Wilson threw the last of four interceptions with two seconds remaining. But the finishing touch had come long before, when the Trojans drove for a fifth touchdown to go ahead 35-17.\nNo movie ending this time for the Utes. This one went straight to video.\nIn the film room. On Monday.\nIf coach Kyle Whittingham and his coordinators’ objective was to outsmart the Trojans, that didn’t happen. With 1:07 in the half, Utah gambled on fourth-and-two at the USC 45. Wilson rolled right and threw a pick-six to Smith.\nThat was the second interception of the half by Smith, who also brought back a pass to the Utah 4, setting up a 21-14 Trojan lead.\nThe half ended with the Utes in a position they feared: Down a couple of scores (28-17) and locked in a scoring festival. Their best plan is to get an early lead and let the defense do its job, not trail early and try to catch up.\nThe uneven outing overshadowed some fascinating moments in the early going. Late in the first quarter, Wilson hit Covey on a crossing route to tie the score at 7. Shortly after, Covey fielded a punt and quickly swerved right, then veered straight, then straight again. Then left and left again for a 40-yard run, to the USC 2.\nHe looked like a Californian taking the back streets to avoid traffic.\nBut shortly after, the Utes must have realized they were playing a team they hadn’t defeated in L.A. since 1916.\nThis is one reason the bookies in Vegas had the Utes 3½-point underdogs when the week began, despite the fact Utah came in ranked No. 3, with the Trojans unranked.\nMeanwhile, Wilson finished 24-36 passing with four interceptions. Realistically, it was Wilson: a fair-to-middling quarterback whose experience doesn’t always outweigh the mistakes, but other times looks fine. His touchdown-to-interception ratio (2 to 4) stunk on Saturday. That’s not to be harsh on Wilson. He got the Ute record to 6-0. Seven-and-zero was asking a lot.\nThough the loss stung, it didn’t end their aspirations in the big picture.\n“It’s still a great season,” Wilson said. “We’re still in the top in the South, so we just want to make sure that we learn from this and make the corrections.”\nWhen it comes to playing USC, they’ve been working on a correction for 99 years.\nEmail: rock@desnews.com ; Twitter: @therockmonster; Blog: Rockmonster Unplugged", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:30:18.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
