Haffey/Getty Images) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNEW YORK (AP) - A person familiar with the process says Chase Utley's appeal hearing for his two-game postseason suspension is unlikely to be scheduled for Monday, which means the Los Angeles Dodgers second baseman could be eligible to play in Game 3 of the NL Division Series against the New York Mets. MLB and the players' association were working to schedule the hearing before special assistant to the commissioner John McHale Jr., the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity because no statements were authorized. Utley was penalized Sunday by MLB Chief Baseball Officer Joe Torre, who said Utley's takeout of Mets shortstop Rubin Tejada in Game 2 on Saturday was an \"illegal slide.\" Tejada's right leg was broken, and he will miss the rest of the postseason. McHale had been MLB's executive vice president of administration from 2002 until April, when he received his new title. He has continued his role of hearing appeals of on-field discipline.
