We want to be ‘1-0’ each week, but we really need this game.” Rutgers win vs. Indiana last year a statistical outlier \nEven before the season began, the trip to Indiana for a 3:30 p.m. kickoff on Big Ten Network was worthy of circling because it was situated between games against Top 10 teams. \nRutgers is coming off a heartbreaking last-minute 31-24 loss to then-No. 4 Michigan State and hosts No. 1 Ohio State next week. The road after facing the defending national champions includes back-to-back visits to raucous Wisconsin and fast-rising No. 12 Michigan. \n“We have to turn up our intensity. We’re sick of losing. We have to go,” defensive tackle Julian Pinnix-Odrick said. “It’s not good enough to say, ‘Oh, we played well but we lost.’ Then you didn’t. We have to keep pushing to get over this hump and then keep pushing after that.” \nA year ago, Rutgers clinched its bowl eligibility on Senior Day in Piscataway by beating Indiana. \nIt was the fate-sealing seventh loss of the season for Indiana, which only has earned one bowl berth since 1993. That could change this season after Indiana’s first 4-0 start since 1990, though injured quarterback Nate Sudfeld and halfback Jordan Howard are game-time decisions against Rutgers. Kyle Flood knows 'What have you done for me lately' nature of coaching \n“This is definitely a big momentum game right here. I know for a fact we all want to get this ‘W,’” said halfback Robert Martin, who ran for three touchdowns as Rutgers prevailed 45-23 in the schools’ first-ever meeting. “We’re playing good. They are playing good. \n“And I know they are going to want to get revenge from last year, so we just have to keep our head on straight and listen to our coaches and execute.” \nFor the first time since Sept. 12, Rutgers will be listening to coach Kyle Flood on a gameday. \nFlood returns to the sidelines after serving a school-issued three-game suspension for impermissible contact with a faculty member. \nWill he have any butterflies in the stomach? \n“I don’t think so,” Flood said. “I’m excited to get back out there, but I’m excited every time we get to go out there. We only get a guaranteed 12 (games) a year.” Did Kyle Flood consider changing Rutgers QB while suspended? \nPerhaps Flood’s return comes at the right time, given Rutgers could be susceptible to a flat start after the emotion of the loss to Michigan State. Interim head coach Norries Wilson’s eyes welled and voice cracked as he talked about late-game clock mismanagement. \n“It’s got to be part of your culture. It’s got to come from the seniors. It’s got to come from your upperclassmen,” Flood said. “When you play in a conference and a division like we do, you have to have the ability to turn the page. \n“I want all of their focus completely and entirely on the Indiana season right now. What comes after that, we’ll deal with after the game.” \nSince Rutgers can’t look forward, looking back might not hurt. \n“This is another opportunity to hopefully make a statement in the Big Ten,” offensive lineman Chris Muller said. “I know everyone seems excited. There was a lot of confidence built against Michigan State to know we’re a good team. We can do this.” \nStaff Writer Ryan Dunleavy: rdunleavy@gannettnj.com 4 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1LxTN7d TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:35:03.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
