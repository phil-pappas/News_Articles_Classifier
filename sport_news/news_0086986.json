After an an 11-year MLB career, he's been a roving catching instructor for the Cubs, a scout for the Rockies, a farm director for the Rangers and an assistant general manager for the Angels.\nAt first glance, it might seem odd for general manager Jerry Dipoto to hire an old teammate with no coaching experience to manage a veteran clubhouse.\nThe reality: Hiring managers with no previous experience managing has become commonplace throughout MLB.\n\"The best marriages are those in which you fall in love and then get married, rather than someone arranging it from 1,000 miles away,\" Dipoto said at his introductory press conference.\nServais certainly fits that description, having been Dipoto's teammate with the Rockies in 2000, working together again for Colorado in 2005, and with the Angels for four seasons.\nWhether he's qualified remains to be seen.\nConsider this list of managers with no previous managing or coaching experience, before rushing to judge the Servais hire.\nThe St. Louis Cardinals hired Mike Matheny to replace Tony LaRussa, and he's led them to four consecutive playoff experiences, including the 2013 World Series, since taking over in 2012.\nThe Chicago White Sox brought in Robin Ventura in 2012, and he's had less success while compiling a 297-351 record over four seasons without a playoff appearance.\nColorado Rockies manager Walt Weiss has been in charge for three seasons. He's yet to post a winning record.\nCraig Counsell went 61-76 this season as Milwaukee Brewers manager after Ron Roenicke was fired in May. Kevin Cash led an overachieving Tampa Bay Rays team to an 80-82 mark in his first season as manager in 2015, though he was previously the bullpen coach for the Cleveland Indians for two seasons.\nAnd oddly enough, Marlins general manager Dan Jennings became the club's manager this year after firing Mike Redmond, then decided he would return to his previous front-office role after going 55-69. In Detroit, Brad Ausmus was hired over Lloyd McClendon to manage the Tigers after Jim Leyland opted to retire.\nHe won 90 games in 2014 before a disappointing 74-87 record this season.\nOf that group, Matheny has enjoyed the most success, though one must take into account that he manages for one of the most, efficient well-run organizations in all of sports.\nSo if you're skeptical of the Scott Servais hire, that's OK. Recent history isn't on his side.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26-W7I3Ji_U"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:56:20.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
