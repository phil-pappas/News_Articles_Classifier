Following on, Railways succumbed (282 runs in 68 overs) to the guile of the Mohali tweaker, who registered his best-ever bowling figures in the Ranji Trophy. This is the third occasion for Punjab when a bowler has taken eight wickets in an innings. Umesh Kua (8/37) vs Delhi in Delhi (1974-75) and Deepak Chopra (8/38) vs Services in Delhi (1986-87) are the other two. With the outright win, Punjab pocketed seven points, including one bonus point, while Railways returned empty-handed. The fate of the match was more or less sealed on the third day itself. Railways, having scored 125/5 last evening, needed 283 runs to make the hosts bat again but the visiting side fell short by one run to save an innings defeat. Arindam Ghosh waged a lone battle with an unbeaten 98 as wickets kept tumbling at the other end. Khanna, making a comeback after three years due to injuries, to shoulder and leg, made the most of a turning track. He used his flight to good use to get rid of the Railways middle order. “Four days ago, I did not know whether I would make it to the playing XI, but when my name was announced I was under a bit of pressure to prove myself. Yuvraj Singh supported me throughout the match and made things easy for me,” said Khanna, 30, after the match. Maninder Singh (1/69) and Yuvraj (1/17) took one wicket each. Maharashtra earn 3 points in draw against Haryana Pune: Centuries from Ankit Bawne and Chiragh Khurana helped Maharashtra post a mammoth 570 for six to earn three points on the basis of the first innings’ lead in the drawn Group A match against Haryana here today. Responding to Haryana’s 335 in the first innings, the Rohit Motwani-led Maharashtra side saw a mammoth 246-run sixth-wicket partnership between Bawne (172) and Khurana (136 not out) to enable a 235-run lead. In a match dominated by the bat, Haryana captain Virender Sehwag (92) started the run-scoring followed by a patient 157 from Himanshu Rana. — With PTI inputs Ranji Trophy Brief scores\nJammu & Kashmir: 330 & 225 (Reshi 54, Dev 50; Gomez 3/8, Prem 3/48) dr with Kerala: 485/8 decl & 44/4 Haryana: 335 (Rana 157, Sehwag 92; Dhumal 3/78) dr with Maharashtra: 570/6 (Bawne 172, Khurana 136*; Hooda 2/75) Punjab: 604/5 decl (Gurkeerat 201*, Kaul 112, Mandeep 109, Khera 102*) bt Railways: 196 (Ashish 90, Wakaskar 69; Sran 6/61, Kaul 4/53) & 282 (Ghosh 98*, Awasthi 44; Khanna 8/97) Delhi: 138 & 437/9 decl (Narwal 106*, Gambhir 93; Nathu Singh 7/87) dr with Rajasthan: 240 & 186/3 (Saxena 80*, Yadav 75*)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:35:19.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
