And they did so without their top scorer. \nThe scary thing for teams on the Trojans' upcoming schedule is they might not have even reached full potential yet. \n\"Well, obviously for the next couple days, we're going to be very excited and proud of our team,\" Parkland junior forward Chelsea Hudson said after the win over Whitehall. \"But after the next couple days, we really know we still have to pack down and fix things. We still have a lot of growing to do as a team. So work to be put in. So we'll be focusing on that and improving our whole team.\" \nRELATED: Parkland sends message in always anticipated Whitehall game \nHudson scored the first two goals of the second half to break open a 1-0 halftime lead over Whitehall. She also had two assists on the night. \nEven though the Trojans' performance on Wednesday night seemed pretty dominant, Parkland coach Al Haddad says it wasn't perfect. \n\"There's a lot of things from tonight's game that we felt that we need to improve on. So we'll focus on those at practice and go from there,\" Haddad said. \nParkland junior midfielder Rachel Medlar , who had a goal and an assist on Wednesday night, says the Trojans are from satisfied yet. \n\"It's a real big confidence builder, I think,\" Medlar said of the win over Whitehall. \"But we're not going to settle for this. We're going to keep working hard and continue to get better.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T11:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:35:49.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
