(BRUCE BUMSTEAD/BRANDON SUN) \nThe West Coast trip is an early rite of passage for the Brandon Wheat Kings. \nEach season, the team heads west to spend a couple of weeks on the road, usually leaving in October. Last year, it was playing teams in the Western Hockey League’s B.C. division; this year, the squad heads south to play the five U.S. Division teams. \n\"It’s a good checkpoint in terms of where your team fit, where your strengths are, where your weaknesses are,\" head coach and general manager Kelly McCrimmon said. \"I know that we’ve always seen it as a real valuable two weeks of the season. From a players’ standpoint, it’s their favourite two weeks of the year. They really enjoy the trip. \n\"Our players only get to go to the U.S. cities every other year, so it’s something that they definitely look forward to.\" \nThe team continued west after visiting the Saskatoon Blades on Saturday. \nThe Wheat Kings visit the Spokane Chiefs tonight (8:35 broadcast, CKLQ), the Tri-City Americans on Friday, the Portland Winterhawks on Sunday, the Seattle Thunderbirds next Tuesday and then close out against the Everett Silvertips next Wednesday. On the way home, the Wheat Kings meet the Kootenay Ice and Moose Jaw Warriors for a total of eight games and about 4,800 kilometres on the bus. \nLast season, Brandon had one of its most successful West Coast trips, going 6-1, including a 4-1 mark against the B.C. Division with wins in both games on the way home. They had less success at home against the U.S. Division, winning just one of the five matchups at Westman Place. \nIt’s overage forward Rihards Bukarts’ third trip west. \n\"It’s a really fun time,\" Bukarts said. \"It’s two weeks together in hotels and the bus and rinks, all the time together. I think we can build a team really well on that trip. We always play really well and I think this is going to be another great experience.\" \nIn their most recent trip to the U.S., the team went 1-4 in 2013-14; the last time the Wheat Kings emerged with a winning record in the United States was 2011-12, when they went 3-2. \nThe team’s rookies have been looking forward to it with undisguised anticipation. \n\"I’m definitely excited to go on my first West Coast trip in the league,\" 16-year-old forward Stelio Mattheos said before the team left. \"To play some different teams will be a really cool experience and I’m excited for it.\" \nBran \n\"There’s lots of travel, that’s for sure,\" Gutenberg said. \"You have to bring stuff to entertain yourself, I guess, and that it’s just an overall good time. \nOverage defenceman Colton Waltz, who is on the last of his four West Coast trips, admitted it’ \n\"It’s my last big road trip,\" Waltz said. \"It’s something that I’ve enjoyed in years past and I’ \n\"There’s a lot of good bonding and sights and sounds of a different part of the country and world. It’s an exciting time. \nICINGS: G Tyson Verhelst, a Brandonite, won Spokane’s starting job, allowing the Chiefs to release veteran Garret Hughson last week … The Wheat Kings are also slated to cross paths with Strathclair’s Morgan Geekie, a rookie forward with the Tri-City Americans, on their trip through the U.S. Division … Calgary F Taylor Sanheim, an Elkhorn native, has been suspended three games under supplemental discipline for an incident in a game against Medicine Hat on Saturday … Swift Current F Jon Martin is the WHL player of the week after picking up two goals and five assists in three games.
