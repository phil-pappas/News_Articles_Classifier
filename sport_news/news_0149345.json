He was a lineman for Lake Travis. It'll be good going up against him.” \nPerine has a friend on the Longhorns’ sideline as well. Texas wide receiver Daje Johnson played at Pflugerville High School, as well. \n“He didn't get to play last year when we played them, but it's going to be good to see him out there,” Perine said. “I hope he doesn't do as good as he usually does, but it's going to be good to see him run around some.” \nDespite Mayfield growing up a Sooners fan, he never attended the Red River Showdown in the Cotton Bowl. A multi-sport athlete, Pop Warner football or baseball games always got in the way. \nHis first OU/Texas experience was last season as he stood on the sideline, unable to play because of NCAA transfer rules. \n“You don't really get the feeling unless you're there,” he said. “You can’t describe it. It's half and half down the middle, crimson and burnt orange. It's a great college game day experience.” \nMayfield has faced Texas before, but not with the Sooners. Texas Tech traveled to Austin to face the Longhorns Thanksgiving Day of his freshman year. \n“It's a different Texas team, but I'm on a different team, too, so it'll be a different experience,” he said. \nThis year’s Texas squad is different on the sidelines, both player- and staff-wise. When Mayfield faced the Longhorns, it was in the midst of Mack Brown's final season at Texas. Now, the Horns are 1-4 in the second year of the Charlie Strong era. \n“That's not the University of Texas I grew up watching, and it's not the one that all those players and coaches are used to,” Mayfield said. “I know they're frustrated, but we can't look at it like they're a bad team. \n“They're going to come in, like I said, and give us their best shot. It doesn't matter the quality or how they've been playing. They're going to come in against Oklahoma and they're going to come out ready to fire.” \nTexas has come under fire in recent days, with one freshman apparently retweeting a Texas A&M fan inviting him to transfer as the Longhorns fell to TCU 50-7 Saturday. Monday, and another freshman tweeting out a note expressing his desire to stop fighting between his teammates. \nEven with the turmoil and lack of success in Austin, Mayfield said he still has the same respect for Texas players. \n“Those players, they got Division I scholarships and they're playing,” he said. “No matter what their record is right now, it's still the University of Texas. You have mutual respect for players that play all around the country, and that's a rivalry, and you have to have respect for them.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T06:58:55.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
