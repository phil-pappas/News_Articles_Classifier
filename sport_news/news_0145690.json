There's a bunch of squiggly lines on there right now and it's not even close to what it should look like when you watch the film.\"\nA quick look at the stat sheet is proof the youngsters are ahead of schedule. Freshman defensive back Ocie Rose was named Conference USA player of the week after intercepting two passes against Charlotte. Safety Jalen Young, another freshman, also has two picks.\nLinebacker Azee Al-Shaair is third on the team with 24 tackles but has led the team the past two games.\n\"If they think they've arrived, they're mistaken,\" Bellantoni said. \"They're getting better but there are still huge mistakes on the field. It is what I expect? No, because I see the bad part about it.\"\nWith the Owls set to begin the heart of the conference schedule week, the freshmen will be given opportunity to truly showcase their ability.\n\"I wouldn't say it's surprising,\" Bellantoni said. \"Yes, they're ahead of schedule but we've got a long way to go. People see the results and they see zero points, 10 points. Then when you watch the film, we can be a lot better than we are. We're going to have to be a lot better because we're going to play better teams.\"\nNext game: FAU vs. Rice, 2:30 p.m., Oct. 10, Fox College Sports.\nsrichardson@tribpub.com\n Florida Atlantic Owls Conference USA", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560c6128/turbine/fl-fau-owls-news-1001-20150930"], "published": "2015-09-30T21:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:48:12.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
