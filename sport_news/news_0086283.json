We know we have to get our game right when it really counts, starting with this Sunday.\" \nLeicester will hand league debuts to five players with summer arrivals Peter Betham, Greg Bateman, Mike Williams, Mike Fitzgerald and Lachlan McCaffrey all making the Tigers' starting line-up. \nBack-rower Opeti Fonua and scrum-half Ben White could also make their first appearances for the club off the bench. \nIrish are boosted by the return of Tonga prop Halani Aulika from the World Cup while new signing Matt Symons starts in the second row. \n\"Selection for the first match of the season is always tough and this is no exception,\" Coventry told the official club website. \n\"The players have trained and prepared well for this match and after a long pre-season, cannot wait to get out and play in front of our home supporters. \n\"Leicester provide us with a significant challenge and we look forward to representing the Club and our supporters with pride.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:12:58.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
