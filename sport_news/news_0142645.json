The Delhi golfer withstood the rough weather on his maiden appearance to shoot fiveunder par and lay tied fourth after 14 holes in the weathercurtailed opening round. Despite a bogey on the 15th, China No. 1 Cheng Jin took the sole lead firing 8-under 62 for a new course and championship record. \n\nHe started with a birdie on the first and finished with an eagle on the 18th to provide an eventful start to the prestigious tournament. Nick Voke of New Zealand and Gregory Foo (64) of Singapore were close behind in second place with matching six-under-pars. Priyanshu, who began his golfing career at the Aravalli Golf Club in Faridabad before moving to Orlando, started off with a bogey on the first hole but sank three consecutive birdies on the next three holes after the sun began to peep through the clouds. \n\nThe 19-year-old is among the top-ranked junior in his high school and made the cut at the US Junior Amateur Championships. He stayed cool after the initial blip for three more birdies on the 7th, 11th and 13th holes. \n\n\"It is a great feeling to represent the country,\" he said with a smile after making his debut and added: \"I was hitting everything very close and it came off.\" \n\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T12:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:34:28.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
