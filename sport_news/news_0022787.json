It’s just fun. It’s just football.” \nDineen still has a long way to go before he can be mentioned in the same breath as the long list of talented linebackers that came before him during the past decade or two at Kansas. But the Lawrence native’s combination of passion for the program, hunger to improve and natural football instincts certainly have him headed in the right direction. This, in just a handful of games at his new position. \nDineen said those natural football instincts have served him well in the transition, and, after spending the first three or four weeks of the season operating like a player who was still processing all of his responsibilities, Dineen has opened it up and let it rip a little more during the past few weeks. \n“Not thinking as much,” Dineen said. “Just kind of seeing things and going.” \nNever was that more evident than Saturday, when Dineen delivered the hit of the game in the loss to the Cowboys, a sack of Oklahoma State quarterback Mason Rudolph, who never saw Dineen coming from his blind side and crumbled after the contact. \n“The D-end did a good job occupying the tackle, and I just got to come free,” Dineen said in ho-hum fashion. “He held on to the ball a little longer, and no one came (to block me), so I just took my shot.” \nKU-OU set for 2:30 \nKU officials announced Sunday that the Jayhawks’ home game Saturday against No. 13 Oklahoma will kick off at 2:30 p.m. and be televised by FOX Sports 1. \nThe official game-time announcement was delayed a week as the network sorted out its World Series coverage. \nSaturday will be homecoming for KU. OU leads the series with KU, 33-14-3, in games played in Lawrence. Kansas’ last win over the Sooners at Memorial Stadium was a 20-17 decision in 1997.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:49:03.165+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
