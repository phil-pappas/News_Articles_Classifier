Manning’s face turned sour this week when asked about his memories from that evening. In retrospect, was there anything positive he could take from being the Heisman runner-up during an experience so few college players have?\n“Not especially,” Manning said, shaking his head.\nNow, nearly two decades later, the careers of Manning and Woodson continue to intersect. Somehow, in a game built for young men, this pair of top-five picks from the 1998 draft continues to defy Father Time. It would be only fitting if they retire at the same time, maybe after this season (or next?), and enter the Pro Football Hall of Fame together as well.\nUSA TODAY SPORTS WIRE\nUSA TODAY Sports' Week 5 NFL picks\nWoodson's Oakland Raiders will host Manning’s Broncos on Sunday, their fifth meeting in the last three years since Woodson re-signed with the Raiders, who originally drafted him. They didn’t face each other much in their first 15 NFL seasons, yet both are keenly aware that none of Woodson’s 62 career interceptions have come at Manning's expense.\n“He’s eluded me for 18 years,” Woodson, who turned 39 on Oct. 5, told NFL Network this week.\nThe advancing age of Manning, also 39, has been well-chronicled, including his late-season decline in 2014 and the changes the Broncos have tried to make this year to accommodate him.\nBut Woodson’s success in the twilight of his career has remained somewhat under the radar, likely due to the Raiders’ constant struggles. But Oakland is off to a 2-2 start, and Woodson has two interceptions despite playing through a shoulder injury he suffered in the opener. He’s limited his practice time since. But come Sundays, he’s the same old Woodson — meaning he doesn't look old at all.\nUSA TODAY\nNFL to test Bill Belichick proposal for cameras along field's boundaries\n“It’s just incredible,” Raiders coach Jack Del Rio said.\nWoodson's ability to maintain a high level of play — at his age and despite the injury — is a testament to the way he keeps his body in shape, Del Rio said.\nBut to two of Woodson’s former teammates, it’s also a sign of just how much he has changed over the course of 18 NFL seasons.\nFormer Raiders receiver Tim Brown, who won the Heisman Trophy himself in 1987, was a veteran when the Raiders drafted Woodson fourth overall. While Brown initially viewed Woodson as a supremely gifted athlete, he didn’t see the traits of a guy who would last well into his thirties.\n“I'm a little surprised because of the Charles Woodson that I played with. That guy did not like to lift weights or really take care of his body. He wasn't married then, so he was a little different guy, even off the field,” Brown told USA TODAY Sports. “But he went away to Green Bay (and) matured not only as a football player but as a man.\nUSA TODAY\nNFL Week 5 kickoff times, TV info and betting lines\n\"Getting married and having kids, man, it's just something that changes your whole outlook on life. The Green Bay Charles Woodson? Absolutely not surprised he's doing this. But I'm very happy to see him make this change and really solidify his place in NFL history.”\nNow, Woodson is the most-trusted voice in the Raiders locker room. He gives pre-game speeches that resonate with young players like quarterback Derek Carr and rookie wide receiver Amari Cooper, who was 3 when Woodson was drafted in 1998.\n“When he was first in Oakland, Charles was not at all interested in being a leader on that football team. He was young, he had other things on his mind, other agendas. I don't think he saw the big picture,” former Raiders quarterback Rich Gannon told USA TODAY Sports.\n“I thought it was so good he would come back to the Raiders and really that can be his legacy ... the impact that he's making with young players in the locker room, teaching them how to be professionals, how to handle themselves and conduct themselves.\"\nUSA TODAY\nNFL Junkies Podcast: Suspended players return, Week 5 preview\nThough the Raiders are still steaming from a last-second loss to the Chicago Bears in Week 4, there is no question they are a team on the rise. Sunday’s game against the Broncos, who have won seven in a row against Oakland, is a chance for the Raiders to show their progress.\n\"It was a terrific signing by (general manager) Reggie McKenzie and the folks there to bring him back,\" Gannon added of Woodson's return and impact, \"because he is that type of player that can make a huge, huge impression with everybody.”\nManning has had a similar influence on the Broncos, who have won the AFC West every year since his arrival in 2012 and currently sit in first place with a 4-0 start even though the five-time MVP and the offense have sputtered at times.\nIt certainly isn’t lost on Manning that both he and Woodson are still starters even though they and Indianapolis Colts quarterback Matt Hasselbeck are the only players from the 1998 draft still in the league.\nUSA TODAY FANTASY SPORTS\nWeek 5 fantasy football rankings\n“I always tell players, if you see guys that play a long time, they're obviously great players, but they're made of the right things, too. All three of those guys are special people,” Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said Friday.\nBut as much mutual respect exists between Manning and Woodson, a rivalry remains. Keeping his streak of no-interception games against Woodson won’t erase the sting of that Heisman night for Manning, but it might help.\n***\nFollow Lindsay H.
