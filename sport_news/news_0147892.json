He also took four wickets. \nAbu Dhabi hosts the first test from Oct. 13, with the last two matches taking place in Dubai (Oct. 22-26) and Sharjah (Nov. 1-5). \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T06:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T17:49:40.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
