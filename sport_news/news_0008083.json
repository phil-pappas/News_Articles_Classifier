Coaches raised their eyebrows in disbelief with incredulous looks. \nAfter watching Olathe North score three unanswered touchdowns in less than five minutes, the Lions had one play left to keep their undefeated season alive. \nOn fourth down with 12 seconds left, LHS senior quarterback Alan Clothier tossed a 26-yard fade pass down the left sideline, and senior receiver Luke Padia caught the ball in the back of the end zone for the game-winning touchdown in a 31-28 thriller at LHS on Senior Night. \nPadia was a step behind his defender in one-on-one coverage and caught the game-winner over his left shoulder, immediately raising his arms once he secured the catch and placed his feet inbounds. He was mobbed by his teammates on the field and sidelines. The student section rushed the field after the final horn.

Perfect throw and perfect catch.” \nThe final minutes and game-winning play rewrote the definition for “crazy.” Entering Friday, Padia had one catch for three yards. He jumped over a defender in the first quarter for a catch on a jump-ball and ran 58 yards for a touchdown — his first varsity touchdown. \nThe 6-foot-2 Padia, who starts in the outfield for the baseball team, was also playing in front of his father for the first time in his high school career. \n“It’s just awesome to do it in front of him and ecstatic he got to see it,” Padia said of his dad. \nThe Eagles (7-1, 1-1 in districts) nearly shocked the Lions with huge plays by 6-foot-4, 210-pound receiver Isaiah Simmons. He caught three touchdown passes in the fourth quarter, helping Olathe North turn a 24-7 deficit with just more than five minutes remaining into a 28-24 lead. \nSimmons, who was held without a catch in the first half, caught a 60-yard strike from quarterback Matt Wright with 2:20 left. Then, after the Lions couldn’t convert a first down to run out the clock, Simmons found space in the middle of the end zone for a 35-yard touchdown with 1:02 remaining. LHS defensive backs dropped their heads to the field after the go-ahead score. \n“We haven’t been behind that much this year,” Clothier said. “Our hearts just dropped. We didn’t know what to do.” \nWith 62 seconds to drive 65 yards down the field, Clothier found senior receiver J’Mony Bryant for a 36-yard connection on a 3rd-and-15 pass. \nOn the next snap, the Lions (8-0, 2-0) called their “Four Verticals” play and Clothier tried to throw a fade pass to Padia, but the pass slipped a little and flung out of bounds. \nThree plays later, the Lions called the same play and Clothier made sure he found his receiver. \n“I knew we had one shot. It was a little shaky but I just tried to give him as best of a ball as I could and he caught it,” said Clothier, who tossed for 138 yards and ran for another 58 yards, including a one-yard touchdown on a QB sneak. “It was just right in the perfect spot.” \nIn the first half, the Lions took advantage of a couple of Olathe North turnovers. Senior running back JD Woods, who was held to 92 yards on 29 carries, tossed a 20-yard halfback pass to Ivan Hollins for a touchdown. \nWhen the Eagles avoided fumbles, they moved the ball down the field until the Lions would strike with tackles in the backfield. \nIn the locker room following their comeback victory, the Lions sang the hook of “Celebration” by Kool & The Gang. \n“It was unbelievable,” Padia said. “Senior Night. Backs against the wall with a minute and two seconds left. Our senior quarterback eases us down the field. Steps up and makes plays and puts the ball right where I needed it to be.” \nON LHS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:55:45.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
