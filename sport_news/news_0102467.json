The Green Wave are riding a 14-game win streak into this week and haven’t suffered a loss since August, rolling most opponents on its way to a 77-18 goal differential this year. However, Ashbrook experienced some adversity in its last matchup with Gastonia city rival Forestview. The Green Wave went down 2-1 in the second half as Forestview scored a goal with 10 men. The Jaguars used Ashbrook’s aggressiveness against their opponent, as the Green Wave were caught pushing too far and going offside on a few occasions. However, Ashbrook did find that tying goal late and ultimately won the game in penalties to keep its win streak going. This week, the Green Wave can lock up at least a share of the conference title with two more wins, but standing in its way is a Forestview team that wants another shot at the conference leader. The Jaguars come in off two straight victories and did not allow a goal last week, defeating Stuart Cramer in penalties after playing to a 0-0 tie and defeating North Gaston 3-0. The Forestview defense has allowed just eight goals in ten conference matches this year, while Ashbrook comes in having conceded just six scores.
