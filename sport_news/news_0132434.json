They tore Ireland apart last week (in the quarter-finals), we had to work hard to stop them scoring a try.\" \nFive Nicolas Sanchez penalties kept Argentina in the contest for long periods but they were repelled time and time again by a stubborn Wallabies defence, before Ashley-Cooper's third score with nine minutes left a nd Cheika raised their disciplined approach in the second half. \nHe said: \"Penalties are a part of the game. We gave away too many in the first half and we tried to rectify that in the second half, which we did a little bit but we still gave away a few too many. \n\"Overall I'm happy we scored four tries. I think we can improve again - that's really important now.\" \nNext week's Twickenham encounter will be the first time Australia and the All Blacks will have locked horns in international rugby's biggest game and Cheika insisted he had not been thinking beyond today's encounter. \n\"I haven't even thought about it (the final). All we've been thinking about is this game,\" he added. \n\"Now tonight we can think we've given ourselves the opportunity to play in a World Cup final and we'll work out how we're going to do it against a pretty dynamic team.\" \nBack-row forward David Pocock was integral to Australia's colossal defensive effort and he admitted he and his team-mates had been run close by an Argentinian side that had lit up the tournament. \n\"(The game was) incredibly tough. Credit to Argentina - it was exactly what we thought it was going to be,\" he said. \n\"It was physical, both teams looked to use the ball and right to the 80th minute everyone was out on their feet. \n\"It was a pretty tough contest around the park, obviously set pieces and rucks were target areas for both teams. \n\"We're very pleased with the win and we're going to enjoy it tonight and then get stuck into recovery.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T20:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:23:24.495+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
