Having been 2-0 up, we have to learn from it and move on,\" the England under-21 skipper added. \nSouthampton, who are eighth in the table, next travel to 10th-placed Liverpool for new Reds boss Juergen Klopp's first league game at Anfield on Sunday. \n(Reporting by Shravanth Vijayakumar in Bengaluru; Editing by John O'Brien) \nOur top photos from the past week.
