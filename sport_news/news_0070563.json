It marked Utah's third consecutive loss, meaning the Jazz haven't beaten anyone since the Los Angeles Lakers in Hawaii.\nThe above is the official ending. In truth, Sunday may have been Utah's best game of the preseason. It certainly was offensively.\nFollowing a lackluster loss to Portland last Monday night, the Jazz had six days off to practice. It's clear they used it well, because they were significantly better as a collective offensive unit. Without Derrick Favors, without Gordon Hayward and without Rudy Gobert, the Jazz rang up a 21-point lead against Portland's starters.\n  The game officially ended up a loss for Utah only because the Trail Blazers' first unit rallied against the Jazz's deep reserves.\n\"Yeah, the ball really moved tonight,\" Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. \"Guys came into the game knowing they needed each other, and I thought guys got good shots in the rhythm of the game.\"\nOn Sunday night, the starting lineup shot 51 percent from the field and made five of their nine 3-point attempts. The regulars turned the ball over just four times in 54 total minutes and they hit 9 of 12 free throws.\nThe spacing, which had been such an issue in previous losses to Portland and the Phoenix Suns, was a constant. And when the Jazz had open looks, the ball usually went in.\nPerhaps most encouraging was the play of Alec Burks, Rodney Hood and Trey Burke. The three were dominant in their time on the floor. Burks and Hood played the first half. Hood scored 15 points, grabbed four rebounds and handed out two assists. Burks scored 10 points, grabbed seven rebounds and notched three assists. Burke scored a team-high 22 points and was the only one of the three to play into the third quarter.\n\"I think last week, we were just lethargic coming from Hawaii, not to make any excuses,\" Burke said. \"We just didn't have as much juice and we didn't play with the same force. By the time we wanted to get up, guys were tired and didn't have the same legs. I thought we played much better tonight. We needed a game like this heading into the regular season.\"\nBy Thursday of last week, most Jazz players were talking about playing Sunday's game and playing again against an opponent. Snyder spent most of the week on the offense, and the spacing and getting much-valued practice time into the books.\nAs he has during the preseason, Snyder played a lot of different lineups, putting different combinations together. At one point on Sunday night, 6-foot-7 Trevor Booker was playing center, with four perimeter players around him.\nBecause the spacing was so good, guys made plays off the dribble and with the pass. Not only that, the rotational backups played well. Joe Ingles scored 16 points, hitting 5 of 7 from 3-point land. He proved difficult to guard as a stretch power forward. Raul Neto consistently got into the lane and made plays for others. Jeff Withey had 10 points, 11 rebounds and three blocked shots.\nFormer Weber State star Damian Lillard led all scorers with 32 points, and added six assists. The Trail Blazers used a 45-19 run after the start of the fourth quarter to take control.\ntjones@sltrib.com \ntwitter: @tjonessltrib", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:17:44.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
