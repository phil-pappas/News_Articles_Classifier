Yet it was still stunning, given what had gone on early in the game.\nWith the late afternoon shadows from a brilliant fall afternoon in Kansas City falling between the pitcher’s mound and home plate, the nasty Price “stuff” was even a little nastier. He was mixing his pitches to perfection and when he exited the sixth inning with a three-run lead and a low count, you had to figure he was finally going to get his first playoff win in seven starts.\nNope.\nWhen Ryan Goins and Jose Bautista got their signals crossed in shallow right field to allow what should have been a routine fly ball by Royals second baseman Ben Zobrist be the first out of the inning, it didn’t necessarily rattle Price. It did, however, allow a glimmer of hope rise out of those Kauffman Stadium shadows for the home team.\nThe bottom of the 7th changed EVERYTHING. http://t.co/1oIy6cVZiI #TakeTheCrown pic.twitter.com/v4ezTcqomm\n— Royals (@Royals) October 17, 2015 “Just a little crack, that’s all we need,” Zobrist said. “And then we started believing. We needed more than one and we got it. You could just feel it kind of snowballing and the momentum changing.”\nThat it did. Five hits and suddenly Price was gone from the game, his best hope a no-decision, the worst-case scenario seeming much more likely.\nThe Royals players we talked to didn’t think that Price seemed rattled — he was still delivering tough pitches — but given his track record in the post-season and given the noise echoing throughout the Royal-blue framed stadium, maybe they did get in his head.\n“Get a few hits off a guy, I’m sure it was in the back of his mind,” Kansas City centre fielder Lorenzo Cain said. “He was tough. He’s tough in general. The shadows were really to ugh. I felt like the ball was kind of disappearing out there the first few innings. We didn’t figure him out early in the game.”\nThey may not have figured him out in the dreaded seventh either, but their pecking attack was in full force. The Royals gladly seized on Price’s latest post-season slip, even if they were surprised by it, even if they were shocked by the fact a pitcher that good could lose eight in a row in the playoffs.\n“He’s just way too good of a pitcher,” said Zobrist, who was a teammate of Price in Tampa Bay. “I’ve been there for some of those (losses) and he’s had a lot of tough breaks in the playoffs. That’s all I can say. He’s such a great pitcher. I’m sure it will turn around for him. He’s going to have a much longer career and it’s not going to end there.”\nIt may end Price’s opportunity with the Jays, however, though we’ll let games three through five back in Toronto play out before we make it official.\n“It was a tough break for him, he was throwing the ball on the edges,” Royals pitcher Luke Hochevar said. “It just kind of shows you the fight and competitive nature of this group. The way Price was going at the time, he was just cruising. He was 18 straight at one point.\n“When you get a guy like that with the type of talent and that kind of stuff, you know it’s tough to crack him. We caught a break right there and one thing let to another.”\nAnd that one thing led to another for Price, too.\nTonight got us feelin’ like … pic.twitter.com/cvJ6ts9ECx\n— Royals (@Royals) October 18, 2015 Blue Jays vs. Royals (Game 2, ALCS)\n2 sec. 3 sec. 4 sec. 5 sec. 6 sec.
