Rutgers football rewind: Ohio State rolls to 49-7 win \n\"We had a lot of momentum coming into the summer,\" Hermann said. \"And it’s time to build the momentum back and get going. We’ve got great opportunities in the Big Ten and we’ve got supporters willing to do that. We’re focused on that going forward.\" \nRutgers Board of Governors approved a new long-term wide-ranging facilities plan in June and then Rutgers athletics alums Carli Lloyd and Todd Frazier captured the nation's attention with standout performances in the Women's World Cup and the Major League Baseball Home Run Derby, respectively.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:23:19.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
