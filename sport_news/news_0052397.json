Old City Hall took three years to build, and after completion in 1865, 38 Boston mayors served from the building. It was used until a new City Hall was completed in 1968. Boston Globe Archives When this photo was taken in 1906, what we now know as Government Center was Scollay Square. That neighborhood was bulldozed in 1962 to make room for the new City Hall and plaza. Officials saw the project as a way to bring Boston out of economic stagnation. Boston Globe Archives The winning design for a new City Hall (pictured above) was chosen by a seven-member jury and designed by three men who taught at Columbia University in New York. The winners, Gerhard Kallmann, Michael McKinnell, and Edward Knowles, later began their own architecture firm. Boston Globe Archives On September 18, 1963, ground was broken for the new City Hall building. Walter Pages of Boston wielded a shovel dressed in Colonial clothes, Boston Mayor John F. Collins was joined by Gov. Endicott Peabody and John B. Hynes, the former mayor of Boston (men pictured left to right). UPI Photo The design for the new City Hall was met with mixed feelings from the public. Many opposed the design due to its lack of congruence with the rest of the city’s buildings. Joe Dennehy / The Boston Globe Boston Globe reporter Bud Collins sat in the mayor’s office on the fifth floor of the new City Hall building when this picture was snapped. Faneuil Hall and the steeple of the Old North Church could be seen out the large windows. Boston Globe Archives In January 1969, the Boston City Coucil met in their new chambers for the first time. They weren’t happy about exposed wires and outdated desks, and voiced those concerns to the Government Center Comission. Philip N. Preston / The Boston Globe In May 1969, the new City Hall had a very modern feel. Edison Farrand / The Boston Globe This photo taken from the 13th floor of the New England Merchants National Bank tower showed just how large City Hall Plaza would be. Jack Sheahan / The Boston Globe City Hall reflected in a puddle in the plaza in 1991. Yunghi Kim / The Boston Globe An overhead view of City Hall Plaza from 1998 shows how vast the space really is. The 8-acre plaza is frequently used for Boston events like concerts, markets, and festivals. The two-stage Boston Calling music festival fills the plaza each year for two weekends of music. Boston Globe Archives Last year, in an attempt to spruse up City Hall, tape was added to the main staircase in the building’s atrium. Headless mannequins were also added to display work students at the School of Fashion Design had produced. Suzanne Kreiter / The Boston Globe Chairs for lounging were added outside of City Hall in the plaza for visitors to enjoy on nice summer days. Jonathan Wiggs / The Boston Globe Astroturf was also added outside of City Hall Plaza for visitors to hang out on. The makeshift “Front Lawn” was put in place to make City Hall more of an attraction for Boston visitors and residents.
