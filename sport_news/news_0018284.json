Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Los Angeles Kings haven't had a great start to the season.\nAdChoices They lost their two first games to the San Jose Sharks and Arizona Coyotes by a combined score of 9-2.\nNow, matters have gotten worse with the latest news on Dwight King: He'll be out for eight to 10 weeks following surgery to fix a broken bone in his foot.\nThe 26-year-old, who finished with 13 goals and 13 assists in 81 games last year, injured his foot in the preseason after blocking a shot.\nAt 6-foot-4, King provides the Kings with a scoring option among the bottom-six forwards. The power forward also provides a lot of physicality, which helps in the big Pacific Division.\nOver the last three seasons, King has been a staple in the Kings' lineup. King has been out of the lineup for just six total games in the last two years.\nKing is signed through the 2016-17 season at a $1.95 cap hit.\nLos Angeles continue their season against the Vancouver Canucks Tuesday night.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "https://twitter.com/lakingsinsider/status/653644653523169280", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T05:06:35.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
