The Indianapolis Colts held the 29th pick in the April 30 NFL draft with an obvious need on the defensive side of the ball after getting gashed again by the Patriots in the AFC Championship Game.\nThe Colts, however, opted instead for wide receiver Phillip Dorsett out of Miami. Brown slid to the Patriots a few picks later and now he is starting to make his presence felt.\nIt’s easy to feel slighted by a team or teams who pass over you. Some great careers — see Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers ­— are built on those slights.\nIf Brown was feeling that way about a team that seemed in obvious need of his talents, then he certainly wasn’t biting yesterday in the Patriots locker room.\n“I don’t want to talk about that,” Brown said as the team has been on lockdown all week in the buildup to tomorrow night’s game against the Colts. “I’m just moving forward.”\nAccording to coach Bill Belichick, forward is the direction Brown has been heading. And praise from Belichick, especially for a rookie, is worth mentioning. Belichick said Brown’s best work came in Dallas last week. Brown, a Texas native, said he has just been working hard to hone his craft.\nHis head coach agreed.\n“Malcom works hard and he’s a smart guy,” Belichick said this week. “He understands what we want him to do. It’s just a big learning curve like it is for every rookie coming into the National Football League, playing against players that are more comparable athletically than what there was in college and seeing the different schemes and dealing with experienced players that when you’re an inexperienced player, that’s an adjustment.\n“But he’s done well with that and I think the last couple weeks have been good. Hopefully he can continue to move in that direction. I thought he played probably his best game against Dallas. I think there is a lot more than that, but we’re headed in the right direction if he keeps working hard and applying himself on the practice field and in film study. He can continue to improve.”\nGetting acclimated to any role can be nerve-wracking, especially when you are essentially replacing Vince Wilfork in the middle of the Patriots defensive line. Brown said he has tried to lean on some of the veteran players and some of the other guys around him learning on the job to get up to speed and earn some of the praise that was put on him this week.\n“Any time I need to talk to someone or ask someone something they are there,” Brown said.\n“He’s a good player,” said defensive lineman Alan Branch. “He goes out there and works hard and does what he’s told. That’s about all you could ask for.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:59:02.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
