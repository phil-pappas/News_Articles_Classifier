Wild forced a fumble on a return. Special teams also converted two fake punts, leading to 10 points. \nTake out any of those plays and the Bombers would be toast. \nA week earlier, the frustrating Troy Stoudermire finally took a kick return all the way, albeit in a one-point loss to the Eskimos. \nSo it's not just new kicker Sergio Castillo who's turned around a Winnipeg kicking game that had been leaving Bomber fans kicking and screaming. \nLike Sherman, Jesse Briggs points to the coaching change. \n“That's the first time I've experienced something like that,” the second-year vet said. “It makes you feel responsible as a player. Because I don't think it was Coach Tracey that was letting us down. We're ultimately the ones responsible. It was a wakeup call and it raised the level of play.” \nAs special teams coach in Toronto, O'Shea built a reputation as a riverboat gambler. Now that he's in charge, the dice are rolling again. \n“Gambler?” O'Shea said of his rep. “It depends on whether you see them as being a gamble or not.” \nApparently he doesn't. \nIt's almost as if there's one less layer of bureaucracy, and therefore less wishy-washy decision making. \n“He'll give us the green light to call certain things if we like what we see,” Briggs said. “He likes the players... to own what we're doing and put us a little bit in control.” \nIt was Briggs who took the direct snap on a fake punt that led to a touchdown. \nIt used to be you could count on the special teams to contribute to at least one touchdown per game by the other guys. \nYou think they got tired of reading how bad they were? \n“Oh, very,” Sherman said. “You just keep hearing about it. It can be one person making a simple mistake, and all of a sudden they end up scoring on it. Now the game's changed, momentum's switched and all we talk about is how bad special teams are.” \nO'Shea, of course, won't take any credit. Or even hand it out -- yet. As if he's not convinced of the turnaround. \n“We'll see,” he said. “We'll see this game. If they can sustain a consistent effort over the next bunch of weeks, then they can prove it. They've grown up quite a bit.” \nOver to the defence, where Richie Hall has his unit playing lights-out – in spurts, anyway. \nLast week's shutdown second half came after it made Lions rookie Jonathon Jennings look like Warren Moon in the first half. \n“It was more a laser-like focus,” is how Jamaal Westerman described that final 30 minutes. \nFor a change, the Bombers were the ones making the halftime adjustments. \nThat's three straight weeks now in which the Bombers have done enough on defence and special teams to give themselves a chance to win, two of those games against the best teams in the West, Edmonton and Calgary. \nThey keep that up, they'll keep things interesting. \nYou may have read in this space back in mid-August how this team was being out-coached on a regular basis. \nThat's not always the case anymore. \nNow if only someone could do something about that offence. \nO'SHEA SEES WINNING STREAK IN WORKS \nMike O’Shea isn’t one for bold predictions, but the Blue Bombers boss may have raised some eyebrows with one on Wednesday. \nAsked about his team’s inability to win back-to-back games this season, the second-year head coach dropped this. \n“Two in a row has been a mystery for us,” O’Shea said. “But we’ll solve that this week.” \nThe 5-10 Bombers, coming off a 29-26 road win over the Lions, visit Ottawa, Friday. \nOverconfidence shouldn’t be an issue for a team locked in a playoff battle. \n“I don’t think we’ve ever been in that position, to be fat and sassy,” O’Shea said. “Our guys don’t get too up. They don’t read the papers and think, ‘We’re on a roll now with one win.’ \n“But to say why it’s been tough to get two in a row – you keep searching for answers.” \nSICK BAY \nCentre Dominic Picard won’t make the trip, leaving Mathias Goossen to start just his second game since Winnipeg chose him second overall in last year’s draft. \n“We trust Mathias,” O’Shea said. “When you draft a guy that young... there’s going to be a bit of time needed. And he’s done quite well for us this year.” \nThird string quarterback Dominique Davis left the team for a family matter and might not make it to Ottawa. \nDEADLINE DEAL \nWhile Montreal, hoping to grab a crossover playoff spot in the West, traded for quarterback Kevin Glenn from Saskatchewan, the Bombers were idle as the deadline passed. \n“That’s obviously a good move for their team,” O’Shea said. “But nothing we can control except winning our games.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:21:13.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
