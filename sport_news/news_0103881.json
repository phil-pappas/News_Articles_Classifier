USC on Thursday formally announced its agreement with Lancaster-based Founders Federal Credit Union, which the school’s Board of Trustees approved last week. Founders Park will become the second Gamecocks athletic facility to bear a corporate name after Colonial Life Arena, the basketball arena whose agreement was recently extended 10 years for $6.5 million. “We’re competing in a conference that’s very difficult. It’s the toughest one in the country,” USC athletic director Ray Tanner, also the Gamecocks’ former baseball coach, said of the SEC. “And it’s important for us to continue to move on initiatives when we have an opportunity, and certainly this is a great move today.” South Carolina’s baseball team has been among the most successful athletic programs on campus, winning back-to-back national championships in 2010 and 2011. The Gamecocks failed to qualify for the NCAA Tournament last season for the first time since 1999, ending the longest run of postseason appearances in the SEC. The facility formerly known as Carolina Stadium cost $35 million to build and opened in 2009. USC has a 214-50 record in its home park, which has a capacity of 8,242 and has welcomed 1.4 million fans to date. “We’re going to continue to work hard to make this stadium the best facility in the country,” said Gamecocks head coach Chad Holbrook. “We can’t stand pat. We’re going to keep tweaking it, we’re going to keep adding things, we’re going to keep doing things for our student-athletes, and also make it enjoyable for our fans. What you see now, it might be completely different in a couple of years.” The possibility of expansion, Holbrook added, is “always on the table.” So are the prospects of naming-rights deals for other USC facilities, Tanner said, although the Williams-Brice name on the Gamecocks’ football stadium is guaranteed in perpetuity. Founders currently has just one location in the Columbia area, at USC’s student union. Chairman Bruce Brumfield said the naming-rights deal is part of the company’s expansion strategy. “The opportunity this gives you to expose your brand to a wider audience — you’re going from regional to statewide, now you’re going to national with the availability of all the TV games and everything,” he said. “So it’s very exciting.” — USC continues fall practice, during which Holbrook said he’s been impressed by members of a recruiting class ranked second nationally by Collegiate Baseball. Braden Webb, a right-hander from Owasso, Okla., could work himself into the weekend rotation. And infielder L.T. Tolbert of Piedmont has struck out just twice in over 40 at-bats so far this fall. “A freshman, you don’t see that,” Holbrook said. “Just a great, savvy baseball player. Sometimes freshmen, you think they’re going to find their way in the middle of the year. He’s played his way into the conversation to be in there opening day.” Keywords", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:19:59.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
