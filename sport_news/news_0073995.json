Coach Tom Coughlin said the wide receiver is day to day.\nAlthough Beckham didn’t practice, he did extra stretching with a trainer and some light jogging. He was optimistic that he’ll be ready to play Monday night in Philadelphia.\n“Treatment, treatment, treatment,” Beckham said. “Just make sure you stay on top of it all and come out prepared for Monday.”\nBeckham also responded to an off-the-field issue.Last week, Jets cornerback Antonio Cromartie called Beckham a “one-year wonder” during an interview. But\nBeckham wasn’t bothered by the comments.\n“I’m not really worried about what anybody else has to say, who’s not on the Giants,” Beckham said. “Doesn’t motivate me. No effect.”\nTroublesome’ injuries \nThe Giants made some significant adjustments to their practice schedule this season to prevent injuries, but Thursday’s injury list included 11 players.\n“All these soft-tissue injuries are very, very troublesome, occurring in games, if you will,” Coughlin said. “And then being so long and trying to get people back. I’m not going to get frustrated by it, but it’s very bothersome.”\nThe Giants with soft-tissue injuries included defensive end Robert Ayers (hamstring), Beckham (hamstring), linebacker Jonathan Casillas (calf), linebacker Devon Kennard (hamstring), cornerback Trumaine McBride (groin), wide receiver Rueben Randle (hamstring) and defensive end George Selvie (calf).\nAyers, McBride, Randle and Selvie were limited participants in Thursday’s practice. Wide receiver Victor Cruz (calf), linebacker Jon Beason (concussion), Casillas and Kennard did not practice.\nRandle injured his hamstring Sunday against San Francisco, but said Thursday it felt better as the game progressed.\n“It’s a little sore now, but it’s getting better,” Randle said. “As long as I’m progressing, I’m pretty positive.”\nDespite the number of injuries, Coughlin said he’s not planning to adjust the practice schedule.\n“It’s not a time to change now. For years we did it one way, we’re doing it this way, we’re going to stay with it,” Coughlin said. “We’re going to see how it goes.”\nBriefs \nCoughlin said he did not have an updated timetable on Cruz. … Guard Justin Pugh (ankle) was a full participant in Thursday’s practice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:35:01.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
