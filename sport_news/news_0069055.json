Offensive coordinator Clay Helton was appointed interim coach. \nThe school hasn't been specific about Sarkisian's problems, but the second-year coach had an embarrassing public display in August at a pep rally where he appeared to be intoxicated while giving a speech. \nSarkisian went 12-6 at USC, where he was an assistant coach under Pete Carroll with the program's dominant teams of the past decade. He spent five years as Washington's head coach until 2013. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:05:16.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
