I'd like to thank some more people that weren't mentioned last week, and then it's time to go back to what I enjoy most, which is covering the township's high school sports teams. \nWhen I started writing, sports for girls were not as prominent as they are today. Title IX was just three years old at the time and female athletics were limited. There was girls’ basketball and eventually, softball and volleyball would make the scene. \nUltimately, there was girls’ crew, which won three National Championships in 1982, 1984 and 1985, as well as cross country, soccer, gymnastics (for a while), track, tennis and golf. \nThe softball program had some marvelous seasons and there were so many great players from 1980 to the present. \nSome of those players that come to mind include Kristin Wilson, Stacey Johansen, Anabel Rodriguez, Lynne Giachetti, Andrea (AC) Curran, Denise Zarra, Mona Stempe, Nancy Coffey, Tracy Buono, Desiree Johansen, Donna Campana, Laura Caruso, Jennifer Citarella, Bianka Cosme, Trecia Donnelly, Kathy Woods, Kim Indiero, Denise Juliano, Janine Luzzi, Kim Mahoney, Gianna Immersi, Marissa Radice, Colleen Mannion, Nicole Andreola, Jackie (JV) Velardi, Mariah Lucena, Gabby Chimento, Nicole Velardi, Danielle Brodo, Donna Brooks, Chrissie Crescenzi, Kim Piscatowski, Danielle DeWork, Gennifer Piscatowski, Laurie Dondarski and Sarah Guy. \nGiachetti, who I profiled a few weeks back in this paper, was a fine softball player at BHS who today is a successful attorney, wife and mom. \nThe aforementioned girls’ crew teams, as well as the 1976 BHS boys’ crew team, are enshrined in the Belleville High School Hall of Fame. \nLast week, I had mentioned Mike Nicosia as a great football player, but neglected to mention he was one of the best baseball players who ever wore the Blue and Gold. \nJoe D'Ambola was as passionate a football coach as I was ever around. \nCarmela Senesky continues to be a great friend. Carmela worked at Orechio Publications, and later, North Jersey Newspapers for nearly 20 years. She was also the \"First Lady of Belleville Football\" as I liked to call her, since her husband John was Belleville's legendary coach for nearly 30 years. \nDuring good times and bad, she'd often echo her famous quote, \"there's more to life than just football.\" \nI am continually amazed at the legacy that John Senesky left at Belleville High. The man coached his last football game at BHS nearly 20 years ago. His former players range from 38 to 65 years of age today. And most will tell you that Senesky's organization was legendary, not to mention the pure decency this man installed in his work as a teacher, and a coach. \nI've always said that only in Belleville could a group of second-class malcontents feel the need to force Senseky out of his job as head football coach, thinking time had passed him by. Earth to those simpletons, the man is still coaching high school football today, with tremendous success. And just ask any coach who had the chance to work with him in this community, and they'll say how far ahead of his time he truly was. Sad part is, stuff like this doesn't just happen in Belleville. Quite often, we don't know how good we had it until it's too late, in any community. \nPete Velardi was a tremendous quarterback for the Bucs from 1998-2000 while Danielle Green was a four-year starter at third base for the softball team, from 1998-2001. The D'Elia brothers, Tom, Dan and Mark, were all excellent athletes at Belleville High. The three have gone on to good careers, with Tom serving as Belleville High's AD for five years. Mark has also stayed in education, working in the West Orange school district, where he is an assistant wrestling coach. \nCarmen Spina was a tremendous football and baseball player at BHS, who is now a successful coach on the high school level. His younger brothers, John and Joe and sister, Maria, are successful coaches and teachers today, as well, with John back at his alma mater, teaching and coaching volleyball. \nWe had some pretty good gymnasts, too, like Kelly Glunk. Gina Lemongello, Denise Wujciak and Joell Veltre. \nBoys’ soccer stars included Hernan Borja, Brian Cook, Greg Groeling, Nick Collucci, Santiago Borja, Ramiro Borja and Nate Guagliardi. \nIn tennis, Rosie Leonidis, Dina DeAquino and Sheri Tillman. \nRay Zamloot played hoops for Coach Don Roll and how could I forget Wayne Richie, a talented point guard for the Bellboys. \nI'd also like to remember Al LoBalbo as a legendary basketball coach and teacher at BHS. \nIn cross country, Jim Beck, Tom Graham, Doug Wamsley, Keith Allum, Nelson Seda, Sue Smith, Greg Moriello and John Matera. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:17:27.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
