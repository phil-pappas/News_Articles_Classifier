It was the biggest blown lead for Seattle since 2004.\nMost Read Stories Seahawks’ Derrick Coleman arrested for investigation of hit, run Mayor wants developer off project, cites violation of city values Police: Woman linked to 1973 disappearance is actually alive Outraged Seattle Public Schools parents, pace yourselves Seattle Seahawks release WR B.J.

The Seahawks also had blown fourth-quarter leads in the NFC Championship Game against Green Bay before pulling out the victory in overtime, and in the Super Bowl against New England, making for five out of its past seven games in which Seattle has seen an opponent rally late.\nAnd making for an uncomfortable feeling in the Seattle locker room.\n“It’s very odd,” Baldwin said. “To be on the other end of it is kind of confusing. It takes a shot to the pride. But I think if we utilize it the right way it can be a good thing for us.”\nThat’s the task this week as Seattle coaches have been preaching the mantra of “finish’’ all week.\nBut what exactly does finish mean?\n“Finish is just doing the right thing longer than the other guy is willing to,” said offensive line coach Tom Cable. \nAgainst the Bengals, Cable said, “Unfortunately that happened (against) us. So we have to own it.”\nIndeed, the Seahawks could hardly have been slower to the finish line, punting on their last six possessions while allowing the Bengals 203 yards in the fourth quarter and overtime.\nOther fourth quarters were not as extreme.The Seahawks trailed the Rams 24-13 heading into the fourth quarter before scoring 18 consecutive points to take the lead, then allowing an 84-yard touchdown drive to tie it. Against Green Bay, Seattle led 17-16 in the fourth quarter before suffering turnovers on each of its last two drives while the Packers scored 11 in a row to win it.\nEach also had some mitigating circumstances.\nThe Seahawks played the first two games without Kam Chancellor, for instance, with his replacement, Dion Bailey, allowing the last-minute 37-yard touchdown pass that tied the Rams game. And Seattle’s secondary and defensive line were banged up in the Super Bowl.\nStill, some of the numbers are damning.\nAs SI.com noted this week, Seattle allowed opponents to complete just 60.1 percent of passes in the fourth quarter in the 2012-14 seasons with a 14-22 touchdown to interception ratio. But since the Super Bowl, teams have completed 86 percent of passes with a 5-0 touchdown-to-interception ratio.\nAnd the result is that a Seattle team that outscored opponents a combined 237-127 the past two seasons has been outscored 42-24 this year in the fourth quarter.\nIt’s a particularly galling issue for Seattle coach Pete Carroll, who has long stressed that the game cannot be won in the first, second and third quarters but can be in the fourth.\nCarroll said among the commonalities are that “there’s usually a couple big plays in there, sometimes there’s a penalty in there that makes a difference in the field position, that changes it. They’re able to capture the moment. We’ve missed a couple of those moments and those opportunities in there.”\nFiguring out why those things happen, though, is the trickier part.\nCarroll insisted Seattle has not changed its offensive or defensive approach in any of the games in which leads have been blown.\nLinebacker K.J. Wright offered up that the team could be relying too much on its history.\n“I believe we might get a little bit comfortable,’’ Wright said. “Teams, they just make a big play and if we dominate so much we don’t think they are going to keep making those big plays.” \nNote • Seahawks middle linebacker Bobby Wagner missed practice again Thursday with a pec muscle injury suffered last Sunday against Cincinnati. However, running back Marshawn Lynch was a full participant for the first time since suffering a hamstring injury against the Chicago Bears and appears on track to return for the game Sunday against Carolina.\nBob Condotta : 206-515-5699 or bcondotta@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @bobcondotta .
