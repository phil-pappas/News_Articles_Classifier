More >> \nWide receiver D’haquille “Duke” Williams has been dismissed from the Auburn football program. \nHead coach Gus Malzahn announced the dismissal Monday night. \n\"When individuals fail to meet the expectations of our program, there has to be consequences,\" Malzahn said. \"I gave D’haquille the chance to prove himself. I am disappointed that it did not work out.\" \nWilliams was a breakout star in 2014, hauling in 45 receptions for 730 yards and 5 touchdowns. This season, Williams has been limited to 12 catches over the first five games of the season. \nHe has seen his share of discipline at Auburn. He was suspended for the Outback Bowl in January for violation of team rules. He was then suspended this past August but allowed to return to the team after seven days. \nWilliams has been projected to be the first receiver taken in the 2016 NFL Draft by many draft experts. It appears his NFL future could now be affected. \nCopyright 2015 WBRC .
