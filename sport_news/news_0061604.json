Jerry Brown signed.\nThe legislation, AB30 , will prevent public schools from using a term that American Indians regard as offensive, starting in 2017.\nDemocratic Assemblyman Luis Alejo of Watsonville says the name dates from a period in California history when bounty hunters were rewarded for slaying Native Americans and should not be dignified with school affiliations.\nOnly four schools in California still have teams or mascots called the Redskins. A federal panel ruled last year that the team trademark for NFL's Washington Redskins should be canceled, but the team is challenging the decision.\nBrown rejected separate legislation on Sunday that bans naming parks, schools and other public property after Confederate leaders.\nThankU, @JerryBrownGov , for signing AB30 to phase out \"Redskins\" mascots in all CA public schools! 1st IN THE NATION pic.twitter.com/14MGjw9mRV\nâ€” Asm.
