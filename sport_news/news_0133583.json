Iceland and the Czech Republic have already qualified from the group. The team that finishes third earns a playoff spot. \nNetherlands captain Arjen Robben, midfielder Davy Klaassen and defenders Ron Vlaar and Stefan de Vrij also are out of coach Danny Blind’s squad with injuries. \nBlind has not called up a replacement for Janmaat for Saturday’s match against Kazakhstan in Astana, but could still add a player to the squad for next Tuesday’s match against the Czech Republic in Amsterdam. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T12:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T14:11:29.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
