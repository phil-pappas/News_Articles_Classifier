Hot pink and ready to rock and roll this hoverboard brings the past back to the future.\nSan Diego, California (PRWEB) October 21, 2015\nWhatever Skateboards is stoked to announce a real hoverboard skateboard that skaters can actually shred. The limited edition hoverboard skateboard launched today, just in time for October 21st, 2015. The Whatever Skateboards hoverboard skateboard has every detail perfected to pay homage to the original hoverboard and one of the greatest skateboarding scenes in pop culture. Get ready to shred through time on this hot pink neon speed demon with a custom grip design so rad it might get zapped back to the 80's. But don't worry; this hoverboard can always get back to the future. The magnets on the bottom graphic are lined up with the truck mounts to get 1.21 gigawatts of steez. This is a gourmet, limited edition, hoverboard skateboard only by Whatever Skateboards.\nThis hoverboard skateboard doesn't hover but it is in the original shape and is one crazy skateboard deck. Clocking in with a 32\" length and 8.5\" width this is sized to ride. The nose is flat, wide, and round like a true old school 80s skateboard and the tail has that distinctly \"vintage future\" appeal with a hard square cut tail. The hoverboard deck is made from pro quality maple for a legit ride. The grip is Whatever Skateboards custom printed Jessup grip tape. It all comes together with the hot pink deck and the top graphic on the grip. The bottom graphic has strategically placed hoverboard magnets so the trucks line up perfectly. A complete setup comes with matching green Paris 180mm Trucks. The final tip of the hat from this glorious unicorn of a skateboard is in the wheels: of course hoverboard skateboards roll around on Cult Classics 66mm skateboard wheels. For those strict to canon there are no footstraps or handlebars.\nThe new hoverboard skateboard is at Whatever Skateboards but hurry up, the supplies are limited and this is a special edition skateboard. And while this may be back from the future the hoverboard skateboard makes the perfect present for any skater. This is one of the best new skateboarding gifts for the holidays and this is the hoverboard skateboard that skateboarders have always wanted. No road trip through skateboarding time and space is complete without the new Whatever Skateboards hoverboard skateboard . It is always recommended to wear a helmet and protective gear even when riding a hoverboard. Please take safety seriously and always be aware of DeLoreans on the road.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13034659.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13034659.htm", "http://www.whateverskateboards.com/hoverboard/"], "published": "2015-10-21T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:48:20.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
