President Barack Obama went on television to decry limits on gun control while some Roseburg folks expressed fear the government would come to take their guns away. The refrains seesawed between public safety and the constitutionally protected right to bear arms, and they were as familiar as scenes from the slaughter's aftermath. But they're stymied by a woeful truth: Nobody knows.\nThat's because defensible information – systematically collected gun-death and gun-injury data, and findings from the rigorous study of both – is lacking. It is known too many Americans die of gunshot every day: about 92, nearly two-thirds of them from suicide. And floating about, untethered, is another fact: The nation is awash in guns, with an estimated 310 million in circulation as of 2010, or about one for every resident at the time. But deep, irrefutable data and the research power that can help decipher patterns in the gun violence and mount defensible interpretations of the data trail most other realms in the public health field.\nReasonable people could ask: How did we reach a point at which a deranged Christopher Harper-Mercer would show up at Umpqua Community College with six legally obtained guns? Rational people could simultaneously, if darkly, wonder: Where and when will the next mass shooting be? (It is irrational in the wake of Thurston, Columbine, Tucson, Newtown, Aurora, Roseburg, and, as of Friday, Flagstaff and Houston, not to ask.) And yet no new regulatory regimes hold clear promise they'd hold back the next crazy shooter. That, however, could in part be because gun violence is insufficiently studied and so few reform proposals are rooted in science, not politics.\nGun ownership versus gun control – a political hot potato, emotionally invoking American heritage as well as current political values – is not the issue. Widespread gun violence must be. Only when gun violence is better understood – where and when it occurs, and how and with whose guns, and by whom – will it be possible to consider and possibly fashion better protections for the public.\nThe federal government did it with highway design and the automobile, requiring numerous features that sharply reduce roadway deaths. Likewise toddler injuries from toys. Ditto safety caps on prescription medications and safeguard protocols for their procurement and storage. Why not guns? Folks attending a showing of the film \"The Martian\" last week at Regal Cinemas/Bridgeport Village in Tigard, meanwhile, submitted to bag searches upon entering – a sorry ritual as public spaces become fortresses and as the gun conversation remains framed first around possession and regulation.\nOregonian editorials Editorials reflect the collective opinion of The Oregonian editorial board, which operates independently of the newsroom.

The man who brokered Congress' 1996 action against federally funded gun violence study is openly regretful. Arkansas Republican and former House member Jay Dickey first signaled his second thoughts in 2012 but last week, in the wake of the Roseburg shootings, told The Huffington Post: \"I wish we had started the proper research and kept it going all this time. I have regrets.\"\nDickey cited the measure he crafted as stripping from the federal Centers for Disease Control budget $2.6 million – precisely the amount that the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention had spent on gun studies. The action threw a chill through the agency, which, The New York Times reported separately, would henceforth notify the National Rifle Association of any research it was conducting that involved firearms. Dickey said he thinks America's succession of mass shootings – they provoke public horror in a way that is disproportionate to the relatively stable but high incidence of gun death – shows that more must be known. He's correct.\nAn impassioned Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden was flanked by several Senate colleagues on Thursday when he insisted that gun laws need tightening up. He argued for closing loopholes that allow people to purchase guns without having first passed a background check; for making background checks that are conducted, as they are in Oregon, more thorough and that states report all findings to the federal database; and for criminalizing person-to-person gun purchases that contravene the law. Wyden's proposals, which will need Congress' support, are smart and should pass.\nBut he and others, among them Gov. Kate Brown , must help shift the public conversation away from gun regulation to gun violence, about which we know comparatively little except that there's a lot of it. Only when researchers are funded and freed to rigorously study gun violence as a public health threat might effective and constitutional protections be devised.", "external_links": ["https://www.wyden.senate.gov/", "http://www.oregon.gov/gov/pages/index.aspx", "https://home.nra.org/", "http://www.umpqua.edu/", "http://www.cdc.gov/injury/", "http://www.cdc.gov/"], "published": "2015-10-10T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:12:20.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
