(AP) - As a new sign-up season nears, the consumer outreach organization Covering New Hampshire estimates that 7 percent of New Hampshire's population lacks health insurance.\nThe third enrollment period under President Barack Obama's health care overhaul law opens Nov. 1 for coverage taking effect in January. Based on federal and state enrollment information and survey data, Covering New Hampshire estimates that 93,106 residents lack health insurance. That's down from the roughly 155,000 who were uninsured in October 2013, when the insurance marketplaces created by the law launched.\nMichael Degnan is director of the agency that manages Covering New Hampshire. He says while some continue to debate the merits of the health overhaul and the state's expanded Medicaid program, it's hard to deny the solid return on investment.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
