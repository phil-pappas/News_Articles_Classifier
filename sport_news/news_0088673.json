There, he hired longtime friend Pat Shurmur to be his offensive coordinator, the same job Shurmur currently holds with the Eagles. \nThat year, coming off a miserable 1-15 campaign that led to Spagnuolo’s arrival, the Rams held the first pick of the NFL Draft. The franchise’s brain trust with Spagnuolo front and center and Shurmur offering input as his top offensive assistant went to the University of Oklahoma to check on the player that was about to go off the board No. 1. \n\"The day we went to work him out in Oklahoma — and that year we worked out a bunch of quarterbacks — I wasn’t the only one that was impressed by [Bradford],\" Spagnuolo said. \"But it was as impressive of a quarterback workout that I’d been to … especially throwing the long ball. I mean every single long ball he threw was just right there, so that’s a concern and he can still do that.\" \nNow it is Spagnuolo’s responsibility, at least schematically, and that of his defensive players, for making sure that doesn’t happen Monday night. \nBradford has been up and down in his first five games with the Eagles at the helm of Chip Kelly’s offense, but Spagnuolo clearly is not the only coach who believes in his talent. Kelly dealt a second-round pick and a fourth-round pick, along with former quarterback Nick Foles, to the Rams for Bradford, to whom he handed the keys to his fast-paced offense despite the latter coming off two ACL surgeries. \nUnder Spagnuolo, the Giants boast the league’s No. 2 defense against the run and its worst against the pass, now without top cornerback Prince Amukamara for 2-4 weeks with a pectoral injury. \n\"[Spagnuolo] knowing Bradford could end up giving us some information, but the scheme matters more,\" Giants defensive tackle Jay Bromley said. \"How the Eagles play, they play at a fast pace. They do a lot of different things trying to get your eyes off of what you’re supposed to be looking at. \n\"You trust what you see, but you train your eyes to see what you’re supposed to.\" \n\"I think the illusion is the tempo: not allowing you to sub, not allowing you to get in the elaborate coverages, schemes that you have based on tendencies, and they do a great job,\" Giants linebacker Jon Beason added. \"They have an amazing skill set and that’s why they’ve been successful in terms of putting defenses on their heels and taking away what you do best, play fast and physical, and it’s hard to do that when you’re thinking.\" \nSpagnuolo and the Giants will do their best to make Bradford and the Eagles think twice as well. \n\"[Spagnuolo is a] very organized, very detailed coach, you can see his fingerprints on [the Giants’ defense],\" Shurmur told reporters in Philadelphia. \"It comes down to the players playing.\" \nBECKHAM QUESTIONABLE: WR Odell Beckham Jr. (hamstring) is listed as questionable for Monday’s game. He has not practiced yet this week, but Coughlin is hopeful Beckham can participate in today’s abbreviated day-before-game session which is run at 75-80 percent of full speed. WR Victor Cruz and LB Devon Kennard have been ruled out, while WR Reuben Randle (hamstring) and DE George Selvie (calf) are probable.
