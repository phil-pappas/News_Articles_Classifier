His playing time increased when Perry Ellis went down with a knee injury, Mickelson played well at times, but by season’s end, he had logged just 133 minutes, compared to 485 for Landen Lucas and 714 for Jamari Traylor. \n“There was some stuff on the offensive end and the defensive end that wasn’t quite clicking with me yet,” Mickelson said. “I think the biggest factor was knowing what I needed to do and when I needed to do it.” \nHe said it clicked “toward the end of the season and in the Big 12 tournament. It just kind of carried over in the summer and got better from there.” \nIn eight games, five starts, in South Korea, Mickelson averaged 8.4 points, 4.9 rebounds and 1.1 blocked shots. He played 138 minutes, compared to 112 for Lucas, the better rebounder, and 95 for Traylor. \n“I’d probably just say energy, if I had to pick one thing, that it was,” Mickelson said of what earned him more time. “I tried to play with a lot of energy. Just try to keep going, try not to quit until the game was over. I think that helped out a lot.” \nOver the past several years, “energy” has developed into a basketball buzzword. Kansas coach Bill Self did a nice job of explaining how the word encompasses more than hustle. \n“A lot of people think they compete if they try real hard. Trying hard does not mean you compete. Trying hard is the baseline; everybody should do that,” Self said. “Competing is playing each possession to win. \n“Obviously, thinking is a huge part of competing, and whether it be — it could be anything from a screen angle to carrying out assignments,” Self said. “You can play hard and not do those things, but when you’re competing, you’re focusing on doing those things, and I think Hunter has learned how to compete more.” \nSelf thought about another way energy goes beyond effort. \n“It’s one thing to play hard, but it’s another thing to play hard in a manner which uplifts your teammates,” Self said. “... To me, Frank (Mason) can do that, but Frank doesn’t always do that. \n“You can really tell somebody that’s valuable to a team if they’re an energy-giver. I do think that we have some guys, and every team does, that try real hard that really aren’t energy-givers. But guys that are real energy-givers, it’s amazing, just everybody seems to be loud and on their feet when they’re around, and I think Hunter is learning how to do that.” \nMickelson has a knack for blocking shots, runs the floor well, has a soft mid-range touch, a jump-hook with the right and left hand and has a nice bank shot. Even if and when Diallo plays, Mickelson will play a significant role.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:59:19.660+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
