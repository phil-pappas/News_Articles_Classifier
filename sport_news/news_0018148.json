You’ve just got to take away the dink-and-dunk and stop the run. He can’t push it downfield like a lot of guys. And when the weather gets bad, it’s only going to get worse .\"\nWhile this seems obvious, it's worth noting as Manning is struggling already. Manning's completion rates, touchdowns rates, and yards per completion are all lower than any point in his time in Denver, while his interception and sack rates are all up. As the league executive notes, Manning's arm strength has been zapped after neck surgeries, and as a result, the Broncos pass offense are a lot of short gains instead of deep, long passes.\nBy the time the colder months roll around, not only will Manning have a harder time getting warmed up and dealing with the conditions, he'll also have more wear-and-tear on his arm from playing more games.\nWhat could benefit the Broncos is a fairly easy schedule after their Week 7 bye week. After their bye, the Broncos only have three games against teams that currently rank in the top half of the league in pass defense.\nAdditionally, the Broncos are still adjusting to a new offense under head coach Gary Kubiak, and they've been tinkering with it to put Manning in more shotgun and pistol formations. They have a young, unfamiliar offensive line, too, which is affecting a run offense that ranks 31st in the league.\nThis doesn't spell the end of Manning's season — he still reads the field well, can make the occasional deep throw if he's got time and momentum, and there will be less pressure on him when/if the run game gets going and his blockers get more experience.\nHowever, given the miles on Manning, his age, and his lack of arm strength from those neck surgeries, cold weather — especially in Denver — could become a scary factor for an already-struggling offense.\nNOW WATCH: Take the IQ test that every NFL rookie has to take\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.businessinsider.com/test-nfl-prospect-wonderlic-iq-intelligence-2015-8?utm_source=microsoft&utm_medium=referral&utm_term=windowsapp", "http://www.businessinsider.com/", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2015/10/15/peyton-manning-denver-broncos-offense-pelissero/74009184/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.businessinsider.com/peyton-manning-end-is-near-2015-9?utm_source=microsoft&utm_medium=referral&utm_term=windowsapp"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:48:34.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
