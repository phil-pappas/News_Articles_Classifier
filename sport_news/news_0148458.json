Kenseth, 12th on the Chase Grid, is 32 points below the cutoff line. \nBoth drivers essentially need wins in the next two races to transfer from the Contender Round to the Eliminator 8 Round. They get their first opportunity in Sunday’s Hollywood Casino 400 at Kansas Speedway. \n“We’ve been taking these races one week at a time, and obviously we had a tough race at Charlotte but we just move on from that and focus on this weekend at Kansas,” Kenseth said. “You want to go out there and get the best starting spot and finish that you can each and every week.” \nKenseth, who leads the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series with five wins this season, has performed well in his career at Kansas. In 19 starts at the 1.5-mile track, he has two wins, six top fives and 11 top 10s. \nEarnhardt has been solid but not spectacular at Kansas. In 18 career starts there, he owns nine top-10 finishes, but no wins. In fact, the No. 88 driver hasn’t won at a 1.5-mile track since July 10, 2005 at Chicagoland – over a decade ago. \nEarnhardt should not be counted out in the Jayhawk State, but his best shot to advance in the Chase is by winning next Sunday’s race at Talladega. He has visited victory lane at two of the three restrictor-plate races this season and ranks tied with Jeff Gordon for the second-most Talladega wins with six. \n“You’d like to go in and get a win as soon as you can in this format, and get yourself locked in to take the pressure off,” Earnhardt said. “Our guys have been bringing some great cars to the race track. We’ve run good at these next few tracks that we’re going to. I’m just going to take it one corner at a time and try to do the best I can on the track, and hopefully we have smooth stops and don’t have any issues with the car.” \nWDUN will have live MRN Radio coverage of Sunday's NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Hollywood Casino 400 from Kansas Speedway beginning at 1 pm on 102.9 FM and 550 AM. \nNASCAR Xfinity Series: Suarez Closing In On First Win \nLearning curve? What learning curve? \nDaniel Suarez has made the transition to racing in NASCAR’s national series look easy in his first full-time NASCAR Xfinity Series season. The 23-year-old Mexico native ranks seventh in the Xfinity Series standings on the strength of seven top-five and 14 top-10 finishes in 29 starts. He also leads Darrell Wallace, Jr. – the next-closest competitor in the Sunoco Rookie of the Year Standings – by 29 points. \nThe only accomplishment missing on Suarez’ rookie resume is a victory. He will attempt to notch his first NASCAR Xfinity Series win in Saturday’s Kansas Lottery 300 at Kansas Speedway. \n“We have to work a little harder, but I feel like we’re getting close (to finding Victory Lane),” said Suarez after finishing fourth last weekend at Charlotte. “We’re competing with the big guys, which is great, but we have to be a little bit better and we’re going to get that win.” \nSuarez has never raced at Kansas in the Xfinity Series, but started 10th and finished sixth in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race there in May. He has placed in the top five in three of his last four starts at intermediate tracks. \n“We’re at another 1.5-mile track this weekend and I think everyone on the team is excited for it,” Suarez said. “We’ve had some success at those tracks this year, and coming off a good race in Charlotte where we finished in the top five only raises our expectations higher for this weekend.” \nWDUN will have live MRN Radio coverage of Saturday's Xfinity Series Kansas Lottery 300 from Kansas Speedway beginning at 3:30 pm on 102.9 FM. \nNASCAR Race Weekend Guide", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:39:20.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
