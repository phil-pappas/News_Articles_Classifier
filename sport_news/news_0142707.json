Though Brown finished with 227 yards of total offense and four touchdowns, the Warriors had to fight off the Wildcats to win the region game. Special photo by Cecil Copeland slideshow MARIETTA — Up 31-14 early in the fourth quarter, Cherokee held on for a 31-28 victory on Friday at Wheeler. Brittain Brown led the Warriors offensively, as he’s done all season, scoring all four of their touchdowns and amassing 227 total yards. The Duke-bound running back crossed the goal line on a 5-yard run with 10:54 remaining in the game to give Cherokee (4-1, 2-1 Region 5 ) a 31-14 lead that appeared to seal the victory, but the Warriors made mistakes later in the quarter that allowed Wheeler (3-3, 2-2) back into the game. “We needed to not fumble the football, we needed to not give up that big (pass play) and we missed some tackles,” Cherokee coach Josh Shaw said. “Clock management at the end wasn’t very good on my part either, and I hate it, because our kids played so well for three-and-a-half quarters.” Cherokee kicker Obie Brannon narrowly missed a 52-yard field-goal attempt with 6:07 remaining, and Brown fumbled near midfield on the Warriors’ next possession.On the ensuing drive, Wheeler quarterback Gabe Magerkurth quickly connected on passes of 15 and 31 yards, then found Terry Smith in the corner of the end zone for a 9-yard touchdown, closing the margin to 31-21. Cherokee’s offense went three-and-out on the next possession, and Magerkurth again led his team down the field with the same result. Smith again caught a touchdown pass, this time from 12 yards away, making the score 31-28 with 20 seconds remaining. Wheeler’s onside kick was recovered by Cherokee, bringing an end to the drama.“I was having some nightmares all week about the last time we were here,” Shaw said.Cherokee suffered a season-ending loss the Wheeler in 2013, squandering a 20-0 halftime lead when a win would have guaranteed the Warriors a state playoff berth. “But it’s good to get a region win, and I’ve told our guys every game is a playoff game for us,” Shaw added.Even though Brown accumulated more than 200 yards of offense, Wheeler’s defenders were keyed in on the tailback, which made opportunities for other players. Montrell Washington led Cherokee in receiving, catching 10 passes for 133 yards. Imad Strozier also caught a 51-yard pass in the first half that set up one of Brown’s touchdowns. Brown’s scores on the ground came from 48, 2, and 5 yards away, while he also had a 27-yard scoring reception.Warrior quarterback Nolan Donley stayed busy, completing 23 of 48 passes for 269 yards. Magerkurth connected on 17 passes for 295 yards, including an 86-yard touchdown to Purdue commitment Benaiah Franklin in the third quarter. Franklin led Wheeler receivers with five catches for 158 yards. Despite the close final score, Wheeler coach Mike Collins insisted that Cherokee held an advantage in every phase of the game. “They lined up and they beat us on both sides of the ball and special teams,” said Collins, a Cherokee alum. “To me, it looked like there was one team that was very prepared for the game, and one team that was not. But I guess you could say we have to take a small moral victory for making it close at the end. I was proud for the way they continued to fight.”Wheeler will celebrate homecoming next week when its hosts unbeaten Roswell, while Cherokee will be on the road again to face county rival Woodstock.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T10:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T00:29:34.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
