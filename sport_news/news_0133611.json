The senior small forward averaged 7.9 points and 5.2 rebounds per game last season. CSU Athletics Apparently, winning two of the last three regular-season championships carries very little weight. The Charleston Southern men’s basketball team, the reigning regular-season champion, was picked eighth in the Big South Conference preseason poll released Monday at the league’s annual media day rollout in Charlotte. The poll is conducted by the league’s head coaches and media. The Charleston Southern women’s team was picked 11th in that poll. The Buccaneers, 19-12 a year ago, lost four starters from last year’s team. Among those personnel losses was perhaps the best backcourt in school history — Saah Nimley and Arlon Harper. The lone returning starter is senior small forward Aaron Wheeler, who averaged 7.9 points and 5.2 rebounds per game last season. CSU coach Barclay Radebaugh said he feels the recruiting efforts of his staff will allow the Buccaneers to again be a competitive team. Included among the newcomers are a pair of Division I transfers — guards Patrick Wallace of North Carolina State and Demetrius Pollard of Northeastern. “I like the potential of this team,” said Radebaugh, who begins his 11th season at CSU and is the school’s career wins leader. “The talent level is very good. We are focused in on meshing the talent together, with eight new players, and teaching them our system. But it’s a team I think will be very competitive this season.” The Buccaneers open the season with a daunting road slate, starting with Wichita State on Nov. 13, Stanford on Nov. 15 and Arkansas on Nov. 20. High Point, led by preseason player of the year John Brown, was picked to win the men’s championship with 17 first-place votes. Defending Big South tournament champion Coastal Carolina was picked second, receiving 10 first-place votes. Winthrop was picked to finish third with three first-place votes. Joining Brown on the league’s preseason all-conference team are Winthrop guard Keon Johnson, Presbyterian guard DeSean Murray, Coastal Carolina guard Elijah Wilson and Gardner-Webb forward Tyrell Nelson. Liberty redshirt senior forward Ashley Rininger is the women’s preseason player of the year. She is joined on the first-team by Winthrop guard Erica Williams, Winthrop forward Schaquilla Nunn, High Point guard Kaylah Keys and Radford guard Aisha Foy. Liberty is the preseason pick on the women’s side, finishing atop the poll with six first-place votes. It was the 17th time in the last 18 seasons the Flames have been the preseason pick to win the championship. Winthrop was picked second with four first-place votes.
