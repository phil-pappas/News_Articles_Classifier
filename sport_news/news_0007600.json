(AP) â€” Corey Robinson made a diving catch in the end zone midway through the fourth quarter and No. 14 Notre Dame rebounded to beat Southern California 41-31 on Saturday after squandering a two-touchdown lead.\nC.J. Prosise ran for 143 yards and two touchdowns, and DeShone Kizer threw two scoring passes, the second the 10-yarder to Robinson that made it 38-31.\nSouthern California played for the first time since firing coach Steve Sarkisian , with interim coach Clay Helton directing the Trojans.\nThe Fighting Irish (6-1) bounced back from an embarrassing 35-point loss to USC in the regular-season finale last year. The victory looked in doubt when the Trojans (3-3) scored three straight touchdowns to take a 31-24 lead. But the Irish rallied to win the Jeweled Shillelagh for the third time in four seasons.\nIt marked the first time in seven tries the Irish beat the Trojans after losing by 30 or more the season before.\nCody Kessler threw for two touchdowns and ran for another and USC but the Irish picked him off twice in the fourth quarter to put the game away.\n___\nAP College Football website: www.collegefootball.ap.org", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:29:37.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
