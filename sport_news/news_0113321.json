A United States military commission sentenced him to another eight years behind bars. He was transferred to Canada in 2012 on a U.S. military plane.\nKhadr later said he only pleaded guilty to get out of Guantanamo.\nHe was granted bail in May, pending his appeal of the convictions in the U.S.\nJustice June Ross later said that Khadr’s grandmother was ill and there was no reason why he shouldn’t be able to visit his grandparents in Toronto.\nRoss ruled that Khadr can also take off his electronic monitoring bracelet, which he argued was embarrassing and interfered with activities such as biking, swimming and playing soccer.\nThe federal government is appealing Khadr’s release on bail.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T23:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:48:38.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
