(Scott Sewell-USA TODAY Sports) Reuters \nThe Oklahoma football travel party was delayed over eight hours as it waited on planes to be cleared for the charter flight the Sooners booked into Manhattan, Kan., for their game against Kansas State. \nOklahoma was scheduled to depart at 2:45 p.m. Friday, but the plane was late to arrive. Then, after boarding, a mechanical issue forced Bob Stoops’ squad to get off the plane and wait for another ride. The problems only multiplied after that and the team did not arrive to its hotel until 12:15 a.m. \nBarely 14 hours later, Oklahoma’s game against Kansas State kicked off. Less than one minute in, the 19th-ranked Sooners established their dominance, breezing to an early touchdown en route to a 55-0 rout of the Wildcats and handing Bill Snyder his worst defeat as Kansas State coach, a span of 24 seasons and 288 games. \nOklahoma had recorded lopsided wins in the series many times over the years when Kansas State was among the nation’s worst programs. But this outcome was the worst shutout defeat the Wildcats ever suffered at home and came after narrow losses suffered in the final minute against two undefeated teams, Oklahoma State and TCU. \nSo much for travel itineraries mattering a great deal. \nThe Sooners played video games, studied film and dined on fast food while waiting for their plane to depart from the Oklahoma City airport. \n“Coach Stoops said fast food on Fridays from here on out,” joked wide receiver Sterling Shepard, who caught a 22-yard touchdown pass just 64 seconds into the game. \nThe rout righted the Sooners (5-1, 2-1 Big 12) coming off a stunning loss to Texas a week earlier. \nOklahoma played fast and never bothered to substitute on the first series while racing 75 yards in five plays. It was the first time this season the Sooners scored on their opening possession. \n“Defenses can’t line up and do all their crazy stuff,” said quarterback Baker Mayfield, who completed 20-of-27 passes for 282 yards and five first half touchdowns before he was replaced by Trevor Knight. \n“I think I play better faster. I’m able to react and go on the run, and our guys like it when we play fast because the defense doesn’t get set up.” \nBetter not sleep on the Sooners. Particularly if they get little sleep themselves.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T14:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:22:27.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
