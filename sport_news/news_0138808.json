(Photo: Daniel Mears, Detroit News) \nCONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE FIRST DOWN \nIt took a few games, but the Lions finally showed they're capable of a defensive performance on par with 2014.\nYes, the Lions lost to the Seahawks, 13-10, and capitalized in a matchup against a Seattle team without Marshawn Lynch and with a poor offensive line. But, for the most, the Lions made plays on defense when they needed to, and that could be a good sign for the rest of the season, especially with linebacker DeAndre Levy potentially returning next week.\n\"Heck of an effort,\" coach Jim Caldwell said of the defense after the game. \"To see an effort like that away from home, in this stadium, against this team, against that quarterback — now, obviously he's pretty special —and our guys, what an effort they gave to try to control him. I thought our defense played extremely well.\"\nThat quarterback, Russell Wilson, and his dynamic skillset was a big reason the Lions lost. He had 287 passing yards and 40 rushing yards, and he made a play just about any time the defense couldn't contain him in the pocket.\nEven with Wilson skillfully evading Lions defenders, they still sacked him six times and forced him to fumble twice. Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said the Lions had some new looks in the game.\n\"It wasn't anything out of this world, but there were a couple looks that executed a couple pressures that caught us a little bit,\" he said.\nThe Lions held running back Thomas Rawls to 48 yards on 17 carries, and since giving up a big game to Adrian Peterson in Week 2, the run defense has been much better.\nThe problem for the Lions was splash plays as the Seahawks had six go for 20-plus yards, including back-to-back long passes on the only offensive touchdown drive.\n\"Guys did what we talked about all week in practice,\" linebacker Josh Bynes said.\nDespite the strong performance, Lions players closed most of their comments about the defense by saying it wasn't good enough to win.\nDETROIT NEWS\nNational reaction to Lions' bizarre defeat\nSECOND DOWN \nThe Lions' offense finally found its rhythm on the last drive of the night as quarterback Matthew Stafford started 5-for-5 for 63 yards.\nHowever, after a perfect throw from Stafford to tight end Tim Wright for 26 yards moved the Lions to the Seattle 20, they started running the ball, handing it to rookie Zach Zenner on back-to-back plays.\n\"We had been pounding it on that particular drive,\" Caldwell said. \"We had some good runs, some pretty significant runs and we had some opportunities.\"\nThere are plenty of reasons for the Lions to consider running in that spot with about two minutes remaining. However, the Lions had run just twice on the drive with rookie Ameer Abdullah going forward 9 yards on one and backwards 1 yard on another, so it's unclear when Caldwell thought his team was \"pounding it.\"\nZenner gained 9 yards on his two carries, and the Lions had a chance to win on the next play before Calvin Johnson fumbled inside the 1. But Caldwell still had to explain why the Lions went with Zenner in that spot.\n\"Obviously, he's a guy that can get his shoulders square and create some opportunities there in that particular package where we felt we were running the ball off the tackle pretty well,\" he said.\nDETROIT NEWS\nBlandino: Batted ball a 'judgment call,' but penalty\nTHIRD DOWN \nSeahawks defensive end Michael Bennett had a nice game, as he often does, with five tackles, one for loss and three quarterback hits.\nThen, as he often does, Bennett cracked some jokes after the game, including one about the quarterback he hit, Matthew Stafford.\n\"He's from Dallas,\" Bennett said, according to KJR-AM. \"They killed President (John F. Kennedy). I hold that against him.\"\nStafford, of course, shares little resemblance with Lee Harvey Oswald, but whatever gets players motivated, right?\nSeahawks players celebrate and the Lions' Calvin Johnson sits stunned after losing the ball right before the goal line, causing a touchback instead of a touchdown late in the fourth quarter of a 13-10 loss.

Once I get one, I want more.\"\nOf course, Chancellor made the biggest play of the game by forcing Johnson to fumble just short of the goal line on the Lions' final offensive play.\n\"It just happened to be in a situation where I saved the game, but I saw a lot of brown of the ball,\" he said. \"I saw it loose, so I just punched at it.\"\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com\ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T16:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T23:11:19.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
