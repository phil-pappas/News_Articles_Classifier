Suddenly Cubs fans are feeling confident enough to poke fun at their postseason prospects, or past lack thereof.\nAdChoices In fact, one, Keque Escobedo, has invoked the name of all names among fans of a team that hasn't been to a World Series since 1945 and hasn't won one since 1908: Steve Bartman, infamous among Cubs fans as the scapegoat for the team's collapse in the 2003 NLCS.\nMORE: MLB playoffs 2015: Get to know the Cubs | Scherzer and Harper's choking handshake is nothing new\nEscobedo, a self-proclaimed lifelong Cubs fan, has started a GoFundMe campaign to get Bartman to the NL wild-card game in Pittsburgh.\nThe last time Bartman was known to be at a Cubs postseason game, he infamously interfered with outfielder Moises Alou's attempt to catch a foul fly ball in Game 6 against the Marlins.\nThe GoFundMe campaign has a goal of raising up to $5,000 to take Bartman to the Cubs-Pirates game next Wednesday in Pittsburgh.\nLifelong Cubs fan wants to make amends for 2003, lets make it happen. First we need to find him to get him to the big game. If anyone knows where he is at, tell him we are looking for him. The money would pay for his expenses including his ticket, hotel room, flights and a little spending money.\nIf he cannot be found by time of the big game all the proceeds raised will be donated to the Alzheimer's Association.\nAs of mid-morning Friday, the campaign had been shared 13,000 times but raised only $760, so maybe Cubs fans' good nature — not to mention superstition — goes only so far.\nBut a sure sign it's all done in good fun: One $5 pledge was made by \"Moises alou\" accompanied by the message, \"I forgive you.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4656760-mlb-playoffs-2015-chicago-cubs-joe-maddon-jake-arrieta-kris-bryant-starlin-castro", "https://www.gofundme.com/ws56s2f8", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2015-10-02/max-scherzer-chokes-bryce-harper-jonathan-papelbon-nationals-handshake"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:28:53.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
