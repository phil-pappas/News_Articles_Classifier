Rebound? Mobile Will Have a Big Say in Its Prospects By Siddhi Bajaj | 10/14/15 - 07:36 AM EDT Reprint \nNEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- Yahoo! ( YHOO - Get Report ) , a firm that once challenged Google ( GOOG - Get Report ) with audacity continues to find it difficult to stay relevant and generate a healthy bottom line. \nIts goes without saying that Yahoo!'s main line of business, online search and ads, remains sluggish. It is uncertain whether the company's most significant initiatives to generate a long-lasting turn-around will succeed. Despite deals with Mozilla and Microsoft ( MSFT - Get Report ) that have somewhat positively impacted revenue, the search and ad division continues to underperform. A planned spin-off of its interest in Chinese, e-commerce giant Alibaba may not have much long-range impact. Yahoo!'s ability to build its mobile services business will have a big say in its future success, but how well the company fares in this area remains to be seen. \nIn the first quarter of 2015, the company's traffic acquisition costs rose nearly 300%, generating an $87 million loss from operations while in the second quarter of 2015, revenue minus traffic-acquisition costs fell to $406 million, down more than 5% compared to the same period last year. There is a lack of sustainable growth even with these new partnerships. What is the top tech stock in 2015?

All this was meant to save $9 billion in taxes from capital gains. \nThere was drama between Yahoo and Internal Revenue Services about the company's seeking advance permission for the spin-off. The IRS declined to provide a private letter that would have amounted to a blessing of the move. Yahoo went ahead with the spin-off, anyway. The sooner Yahoo acts, the better. Additionally, spinning off the business as a token operating business increases the chance of approval. Looking at the numbers, the stake's value has decreased from $40 billion in January to $25 billion, owing to the weakness in Alibaba shares. The slowdown in China and competition from smaller, nimble players is weighing on Alibaba, and is also reflecting in Yahoo's stock. The major concern for the Yahoo investors is the tax impact of the spin off. 1 of 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T14:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:47:35.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
