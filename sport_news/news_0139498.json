Ask the experts! \nPISCATAWAY, N.J. — J.T. Barrett did not forget how to start. Well, the Buckeyes were a little sluggish at the start, but as the night grew old, they grew more bold. Barrett did his thing at quarterback with more than 300 yards of total offense on Saturday in a 49-7 win over Rutgers. Ezekiel Elliott passed 100 yards rushing for the 13th straight 100-plus rushing game, and Michael Thomas had a tour de force at receiver. The defense gave up an early drive that ended with a missed field-goal attempt try by Rutgers off the left upright, then held sway until allowing a touchdown in the final minute.\nObvious stars Barrett was 14 of 18 passing for 223 yards and three touchdowns, including a shovel pass that Jalin Marshall turned into a TD late. Barrett also ran for 101 yards on 13 carries. Elliott had his way blocked by an eager Rutgers defense early, gaining only 15 yards in the first half, but his last carry of the — night – a 55-yard run for his second TD —– put him at 142 for the game. Cornerback Gareon Conley’s diving interception in the third quarter and his blocked punt in the fourth were the highlights of an overall stifling night for the defense.\n>> Get the most out of your Ohio State experience, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \nUnsung workers The defense took the measure of Rutgers on its first possession, then, led by Joey Bosa, Adolphus Washington, Raekwon McMillan and Conley, scarcely let the Scarlet Knights out of arms’ reach the rest of the way. The offensive line solved Rutgers’ shenanigans up front as the game progressed, but especially at the start of the second half. Elliott was the prime beneficiary.\nStrategically speaking The run-pass mix of Barrett was more than Rutgers could handle. It even brought a play midway through the third quarter, a drift shovel left with running back Curtis Samuel, that Barrett elected to keep and cut up 10 yards for the a touchdown and a 35-0 lead. The Buckeyes had not shown that play previously this season.\n>> Click for details on how to win tickets and trips to OSU games from Dispatch Reader Rewards \nExposed The defense gave up some rushing yards early, but coming off a tough stretch against the run the previous several games, the Buckeyes tightened as the game went along. On offense, Barrett took some solid hits early, the most vicious coming from his teammate Michael Thomas, who was trying to throw a block on the first drive. Barrett was stunned and fumbled. Rutgers recovered, and headed into the last three minutes of the game, that was OSU’s only turnover of the night.\nStat that matters 528: The Buckeyes topped 500 yards in total offense for the fourth time this season.\nInjury report Ohio State did not report any. Linebacker Joshua Perry, who had an ankle injury the week before, played all night, or at least while the first-teamers were on the field.\nBy the numbers 28: Consecutive Ohio State Big Ten regular-season wins.\n21: Consecutive Ohio State victories, longest active streak in the nation.\nNext step The Buckeyes have the week off -- from playing a game that is. That made the Rutgers game their last chance to impress the College Football Playoff committee before the first rankings are released on Nov. 3.\ntmay@dispatch.com \n@TIM_MAYsports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:17:59.360+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
