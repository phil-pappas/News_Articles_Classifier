Newburgh: Between a deep backfield, an effective passing game, a swarming front seven, a veteran secondary and a great kicker (sophomore Pete Matthews), there’s a lot to like about Newburgh. 2. Monroe-Woodbury: Last week’s 37-0 win over Warwick made the Crusaders look like they’ve returned more than just a handful of starters from last season. 3. Cornwall: The Green Dragons had five sacks in last week’s win over Poughkeepsie, and Jason Bailey was in prime form with 14-for-20 passing. 4. Valley Central: A win over Minisink Valley that included three Brett Jennings field goals puts VC ahead of MV in the rankings. 5. Minisink Valley: The Warriors showed resilience with a comeback charge against Valley Central that fell slightly short. But Minisink Valley has some offensive kinks to fix for a deep playoff run. CLASS B-D 1. Marlboro: The Iron Dukes have dominated consecutive playoff contenders in Spackenkill and Rondout Valley. It’s looking less likely any team will make for an interesting regular-season matchup. 2. Chester: Chris Battiato has 59 rushes for 776 yards through four games, and Colin Marco has 512 yards rushing. It might take a few lucky breaks for any Section 9 Class C team to beat Chester. 3. Liberty: The Indians, to face Chester on Friday, have a deep backfield of their own in Roy Penn-Cosentino, Kevin Morgans and Raleigh Ranne. And quarterback Grant Harman has a 72.9 completion percentage. 4. Millbrook: Another Class C team, Millbrook rushed for 694 yards in last week’s win over Rye Neck, including 245 from Delvin Wood. 5. James I. O’Neill: The Raiders began division play with an exclamation point in last week’s 62-8 win over Pine Plains. Tiquan Scott rushed for 157 yards and four touchdowns, while Chase Prairie recorded 12 tackles. recordonline.com Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 8:51 PM Updated at 11:53 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T16:17:22.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
