By SCHUYLER DIXONAP Sports Writer \nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) - The Texas Rangers clinched a wild-card spot and moved to the cusp of the AL West title, with Adrian Beltre's three-run double backing Derek Holland in a 5-3 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Thursday night. \nThe Rangers (87-72), in the playoffs for the first time since 2012 after a 95-loss season, are a win or a Houston loss away from their first division title since winning two straight and going to the World Series in 2010-11. \nThe Angels can't defend their AL West championship, but still have a shot at the second wild card with three games left. Los Angeles (83-76) is a game behind the Astros and tied with Minnesota, which beat Cleveland 4-2. \nHolland (4-3) allowed three hits and three runs in 6 1-3 innings for his first win since Sept. 5.
