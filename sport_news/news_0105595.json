Soto stands accused of giving tactical information to opponents, and will presumably have his contract terminated if proven guilty.\nIt is understood that Soto, in his second stint with the club, has been sharing tactical information with former Scorpions players now on different clubs. Speaking to the NASL on Friday afternoon, they confirmed that the league was doing an investigation of the allegation, and until completed, Soto is suspended from all activities.\nThe rumours after the deception was revealed were that Soto was merely revealing the starting XI, quite probably because he was not in it. However it appears to be more than that, no sources are going in to detail and the Scorpions organization are playing it close to the chest but sources have said that more will be revealed about what exactly has happened as time goes on.\nSoto has fallen out of favour with the club over the last couple of years, with head coach Alen Marcina signing many players in Soto’s possible positions. Soto has barely appeared recently, coming off the bench for few minutes, his most recent use to the club was in a charitable hair cut for cancer research.\nThe idea that this is merely the distribution of team lineups would seem unlikely as that sort of activity happens regularly around the world with disgruntled players, although typically that leaking is to the media more than opponents. So what Soto has done is likely going more in to tactical information with friends on opposing sides.\nShould the case be proven it would almost certainly end Soto’s career, it’s clear that even if it’s not true, the relationship between the Scorpions and Soto is now untenable. But if the allegations are proven by the Scorpions then it’s difficult to see Soto being picked up by another club, and if not proven, it would be difficult for the Scorpions to attract players to the club under the current back-office that would allow such a story to get out, when not proven.\nThere are no winners in this solution, if not proven the story will be an indictment on the Scorpions but even if proven it will be bad news for the club. Alen Marcina has clearly lost the locker room if this sort of activity is happening, and if the horrible fall from grace of the club in 2015 wasn’t enough for the axe to fall, this could well do it. It seems certain that Soto will not be a Scorpion in 2016 and Marcina could well be joining him.", "external_links": ["http://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/article/Scorpions-Soto-suspended-while-being-6574363.php?cmpid=twitter-desktop"], "published": "2015-10-18T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:20:07.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
