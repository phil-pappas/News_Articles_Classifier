The development has not only shaken the ongoing investigation of the Jalandhar police, but has also left the police in dismay. Power’s daughter Emma Laura Power, while confirming the development to The Tribune from the UK, said, “The DNA test and the dental records in the UK have proved that the body was not of my father. I don’t know whose body they sent to the UK. The Coroner in the UK is investigating the matter and we will get justice through legal system.” Coroners are independent judicial officers in the UK, appointed by the local authority, responsible for investigating the causes and circumstance of deaths. Emma said, “Our family had an agonising wait for the formal identification of a body found in India, to discover it was not of Power. We would like to make this major detail known.” Sources confirm that the UK authorities have conducted the DNA examination of Power’s dental records with his toothbrush that have not matched. Following the examination, sources privy to the police department confirmed that the British Embassy through the Indian Embassy also sent an email to the Jalandhar police asking if the DNA of dental records of Power is admissible in India as evidence in the ongoing investigation. The email reportedly stated that the examination of the deceased’s jaw was also conducted in the UK by a doctor where he was taking his dental treatment. ADCP Amrik Singh Power said, “We have reverted to the British High Commission that the DNA of dental records is not admissible in investigation. We have told the High Commission to send the DNA sample of Ranjit Power’s mother for conducting DNA in India and only that report will be admissible.” The ADCP said, “The police have been repeatedly asking Power’s family in the UK to send the DNA of his mother, but the family has been delaying the same. We have already taken the sample of Power’s brother Amrik and are waiting for his mother’s sample which is must to authenticate the DNA of the body.” The NRI’s body was recovered from near a dam situated on the Pehowa-Ambala road, 20 km away from the Ambala city on June 1, 2015. Power, 55, owned a four-star Ramada Park Hall Hotel in Wolverhampton in the West Midlands region of England. He previously owned the Connaught Hotel in Wolverhampton before selling it in 2004.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:03:30.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
