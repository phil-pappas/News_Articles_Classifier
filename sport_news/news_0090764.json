A trade would at least bring the Bears a reward rather than just letting him go next spring.\nBears general manager Ryan Pace has made three big moves since Monday so it might not be totally surprising to see if Forte was shipped out.\nIt sounds like things could even get more hectic in Chicago if Forte were to suddenly depart. Losing Forte while going without Jay Cutler and Alshon Jeffery could spell immediate disaster for a winless Chicago Bears.\nIt could also signal the franchise has the 2016 NFL Draft and Cal quarterback Jared Goff on the mind.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/AllbrightNFL/status/648983348329644032"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:11:09.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
