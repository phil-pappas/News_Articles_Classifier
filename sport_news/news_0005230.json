And second baseman Ryan Goins, who pulled away from the shallow pop-up that turned the tide Saturday in Kauffman Stadium, had the game of his postseason life at the plate.\nThe bottom line was an 11-8 victory in a raucous Rogers Centre over the Royals that got Toronto back into the American League Championship Series. The Blue Jays now trail it, two games to one, with Game Four set for Tuesday at 4 (FOX 1). Knuckleballer R.A. Dickey will pitch for Toronto against 6-foot-10 Kansas City righty Chris Young, his teammate with the New York Mets in 2011-12.\nThe Blue Jays had been held to just three runs and a .197 batting average in the first two games, but their offense erupted to hit double figures at home in the postseason for the first time in franchise history. The Jays got three runs in the second, two on a Goins single, and exploded for six more in the third to drive Kansas City’s Johnny Cueto to an early exit.\nThe big blows in that inning were a screaming three-run homer to center by Troy Tulowitzki and a two-run bomb by Josh Donaldson, a 458-foot blast to the second deck in left. Goins added his first career postseason home run with a liner to right that made the score 10-4 in the fifth, joining Hall of Famer Roberto Alomar as the only Toronto second basemen to go deep under the bright lights of October.\nGoins had spent the last two days taking responsibility for the gaffe of Game Two, where he pulled away from a seventh-inning pop-up that he thought Jose Bautista had called for in right field. It fell in and was the catalyst for the Royals to erase a 3-0 deficit and rally for a 6-3 win.\n“I put it mentally behind me,” said Goins, who had not homered since Sept. 1. “Today it was probably the last thing in the back of my head. I didn’t think about it. I came out today with the mindset of doing whatever I could to help this team win. I just had to continue what I’ve been doing all season and that’s contribute offensively, defensively, baserunning. Whatever I can do to help this team win.”\n“I think everybody in that locker room had his back,” said Tulowitzki. “He deserved this. He put his head down, he focused on the next game and that’s what you do.”\nGoins, who was 0 for 17 in the division series against Texas, is 4 for 10 in this series and has hit safely in all three games. His single in the second was a classic at-bat.\nGoins fell behind in the count, 0 and 2, and eventually worked it full while fouling off a trio of full-count pitches. Then he finally won the battle by lashing his single to left to score Tulowitzki and Kevin Pillar, with the Toronto center fielder coming home via a head-first faceplant into the plate and around the tag of Royals catcher Salvador Perez.\n“It was really the perfect game for him the day after,” manager John Gibbons said of Goins. “And he’ll feel much better about himself.”\n“I’ve always said the first runs are the hardest score and especially at that time,” Donaldson said. “From there, we just kept rolling. “The entire night we had great at-bats, not just good at-bats.”\nAll the offense came in support of 24-year-old Marcus Stroman, who battled through 6∑ innings to get his first career postseason win. It came roughly seven months after he underwent major knee surgery from a freak spring training injury that was supposed to shelve him until 2016.\nThe roaring, towel-waving sellout crowd of 49,751 included Buffalo Sabres forwards Jamie McGinn and Evander Kane and defenseman Carlo Colaiacovo. The trio traveled to the game via helicopter and tweeted pictures from front-row seats behind home plate.\nMcGinn is a lifelong Blue Jays fan who regularly tweets about the club and Colaiacovo is a Toronto native who was originally drafted by the Maple Leafs in 2001. Kane, meanwhile, was at his second October showdown in two nights after going to New York on Sunday night for Game Two of the National League Championship Series between the Mets and Chicago Cubs.\nThe crowd was uneasy in the early going but the dome became party central when the Blue Jays blew this one open by getting the first five men on base in the third to drive Cueto out.\nEdwin Encarnacion led off with a single, Chris Colabello walked and Tulowitzki crushed an 0-1 fastball from Cueto to make it 6-2. It was his second three-run homer of the postseason, joining his blast in Game Three at Texas that turned around the division series.\nRussell Martin walked and Pillar pulled a double over short that carried to deep left-center to make it 7-2 and end Cueto’s night. Reliever Kris Medlen got the first two men he faced but then made a huge mistake to Donaldson, hanging a fat curveball that the Toronto third baseman pounded to make it 9-2.\nThe six-run inning tied the Toronto record for the biggest in its postseason annals, equaling a pair of six-run frames during the 1993 World Series against Philadelphia.\nThat was plenty for Stroman, who gave up 11 hits and was far from his best at times in this one. But the 24-year-old was efficient when he needed to be, including a nine-pitch fourth inning to retire the Royals in order just after the Blue Jays had blown the game open. He left to a standing ovation with one out in the seventh, tipping his cap and patting his heart to the crowd as he entered the dugout.\nemail: mharrington@buffnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:06:46.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
