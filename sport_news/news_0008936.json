Merrill NEW — 2:01 p.m. Oct. 14, 2015 After 10 1 / 2 years as editor/managing editor of The Issaquah Press, and managing editor of our other newspapers — Sammamish Review, SnoValley Star and Newcastle News — I have given my resignation. My last day is Oct. 16. After that, I will move away and start a new, different life away from newspapers after decades in the business. It’s hard to write a goodbye column, because what should you say, or not say? It’s like an Oscar speech, it could go on and on and not really say anything important, and you’re going to forget someone, no matter how hard you wrack your brain for the people you want to thank. Kathleen MerrillPress managing editor So, I want to thank each and every person who has helped me during my decade-plus here. You know who you are. And for each of you, I wish you much luck and love and joy and peace. There are some sweet things I will always remember, like the kindnesses I received after the deaths of three German shepherds over the years, and the death of my mom almost two years ago. I love that some people felt compelled to reach out to me after I wrote about those painful experiences. They offered wonderful stories, condolences, sweet memories. We need more people like that in the world. There are some things I will miss, and they aren’t the standard things people always list about Issaquah: I’ll miss our local library, which knocks it out of the park with great programming and awesome librarians. That place is a blessing in a chaotic world. If you haven’t been there in a while, or maybe not ever, give it a chance. The librarians are a fountain of knowledge and helpfulness. And where else can you get thousands of dollars worth of things for free with the promise that you will return them? I’ll miss those people who work behind the scenes to do awesome things for others while not caring if they get recognition for it. I’ll miss those tigers at the zoo, hanging out by their enclosures and communing with those big, beautiful beasts. Every single time I talk about them, people ask where there are tigers. Seriously? Go to our local zoo! A few things I won’t miss: Spending 45 minutes traveling 2 miles to get home from work. Those people who endlessly complain about a problem but refuse to do anything to help solve it. The rain, the rain, the rain! \nAnd finally, I will leave you with a few things I have learned in the past 10 years that might help you. Never get too anything — too angry, too hungry, too sleepy, too sad, too isolated. You can never go wrong doing the right thing. And your heart will always tell you what the right thing is. You can never go wrong doing the kind thing. And if you can’t do a big thing for someone, do a small thing. Offer a smile, a helping hand, a compliment, a ride. Pay it forward and backward. Life is both too short and too long to live unhappy. So, if you’re not thrilled about your situation, take your power into your own hands and change it. \nAnd if these things don’t pertain to you, that’s OK. Live your life the way you want to. It’s yours and you are the expert regarding what’s best for you. Fairy tales always end with people living happily ever after. I’ve decided to make my own fairy tale and live happily ever now. I hope you will do the same. \nWritten by Kathleen R. Merrill · Filed Under Columns/Off the Press , Opinion \nCopyright © 2015 by Issaquah Press Inc. All rights reserved.
