For attendees, MyGenetx will offer information on BRCA1/2 genetic screenings and will provide a free BRCA1/2 screen to those who meet the suggested screening guidelines and have physician approval. In addition, MyGenetx will supply complimentary event shirts for all attendees. BRCA1/2 are the most well-known genes linked to breast cancer risk.\nThe Predators' organization will honor several middle-Tennessee breast cancer patients and survivors by providing game tickets, as well as rides on the Zamboni.\nAttendees also have the opportunity to make donations to the event's featured charity, the Tennessee Breast Cancer Coalition (TBCC). The Nashville Predators Foundation will make a $1,000 contribution to the charity.\nThe Tennessee Breast Cancer Coalition, established in 1995, is a grassroots organization dedicated to improving the quality of life for individuals undergoing treatment for breast cancer. The TBCC mission is to be the foremost advocate and provider for Tennesseans facing breast cancer through individual assistance, education, and legislative action. In 2002, TBCC established the Emergency Access Fund to provide financial assistance to individuals in financial need due to inability to work and or mounting medical expenses incurred while undergoing treatment of breast cancer. This fund is designed to partner with other established community agencies to provide quick turn-around funding. This fund has provided assistance in preventing evictions, paying utilities, insurance and medical necessities. Recipients must be residents of Tennessee and currently undergoing breast cancer treatments. For more information about qualifications and how to receive assistance from this fund please call 615-377-8777.\n\"We are so excited to be working with the Predators and MyGenetx to bring awareness to Tennessee Breast Cancer Coalition and to also educate women about BRCA screening. We want women to know if they could have the inherited gene that puts them at a higher risk of developing breast cancer. We also want them to know that if they have been diagnosed with breast cancer, they are in treatment and struggling financially, TBCC may be able to help them with basic necessities like, rent, mortgage payments and utilities,\" says Jami Eller, Executive Director at TBCC\nAccording to the National Cancer Institute, One in eight women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year. For women who are BRCA1/2 positive, the risk is one in two. It is reported that an estimated one in 500 women have a BRCA1/2 mutation, and in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, the number rises to one in 40.\nMyGenetx is a CLIA certified molecular and general chemistry laboratory, providing timely and comprehensive test results.
