It was the best sound bite of the week and we just had to share. Enjoy: \nWe're like Kentucky Fried Chicken. We just do chicken. We'll throw a gizzard or a liver in there but we do chicken. We don't do hamburger, we don't do beef. We do chicken so we do the same thing over and over and over again. We get into a routine and we like to stay in the routine that we're in so we don't change a lot from day to day from week to week whether we're at home or we're away. \nNC A&T is 4-1 on the season. They're back home in Aggie Stadium Saturday taking on Bethune-Cookman at 1 PM.
