What do they have to do to get back on the ice? \nThe Canucks are a win away from their best start in franchise history, and their coach is lighting a fire under them. \nBrandon Sutter has been demoted to the top line, again. Talk about first-world problems. \nMeanwhile, Sven Baertschi is brushing off a boot to the keister, despite leading all forwards in shot-attempt differential. \nBaertschi was odd man out at Thursday’s practice, something that is expected to continue Friday against the St. Louis Blues. \nIf you thought it was going to be easy for the young guys this season, you’ve clearly spent too much time watching Bo Horvat. \nThe Canucks have one forward who has been on the ice for more shot attempts for than against. His last name is Baertschi. He’s the player who had two shots on net Tuesday in L.A, drew a penalty and ended up on the fourth line, switching spots with Brandon Prust of all people. \n“Life goes on,” was the response from the chilled Baertschi. \n“If I was 30-years-old, maybe it would be different. I’d be like ‘What’s going on here?’ \n“But I’m still young. The main thing is I have to stay calm and as soon as I get a chance again, I have to secure a spot.” \nNone of this should be taken as a defence of Baertschi’s play. Although his advanced stats are interesting, it’s too early to draw conclusions. To the eye, he was good in Anaheim. He was not so good against the L.A. Kings. \nOverall, his performance, and he knows this, has been mixed, unproductive points-wise and evidently not at a level deemed acceptable by head coach Willie Desjardins. \nThe coach made that clear Thursday when he was as blunt, cold and quotable as he’s ever been. \nGenerally, in a season, Desjardins gives the media fewer sound bites than baseball gives us controversial bat flips. \nBut he dropped what can only be described as a “beauty” when asked about his handling of Baertschi and Jake Virtanen, the 19-year-old who played well and still got benched in his first NHL game. \n“It’s not the try league, as I’ve said, it’s the get-it-done league,” Desjardins said. \nTo put that in perspective, as far as Desjardins quotes go, he could have pulled the Joey Bautista flip after this one and walked out of the presser and we would have slow clapped him the whole way. \nBut Desjardins continued: \n“You can’t do anything (and by that he presumably means you can’t hold young players’ hands). \n“We have to win games. If guys aren’t performing at that level, then we have to take them out.” \nIcy stuff from the coach, but he’s not wrong. If you’re looking to be carried in a Baby Bjorn while being entertained by tickle monsters you’re not going to get it in the NHL. \nThese issues, however, are never black and white. In the past six months, the Canucks have made a substantial commitment to Baertschi in terms of the asset they gave up to get him and the top-six roster spot they quickly bestowed him. \nIt’s on him to make them look smart. But it’s also on the coach to give him the opportunities he needs to make this happen. \nBaertschi is an offensive player, a creative playmaker, who can’t just make a big hit to get noticed on a shift. \nHis game is far more nuanced and his success is dependent on the players he’s with. He needs chemistry with his linemates and there will be times when he needs patience from his coach. \nIf he’s playing with Radim Vrbata, say, he needs to figure where and how to get Vrbata the puck so the Canucks’ best goal scorer can, you know, score goals. \nThough that line, including centre Bo Horvat, has done some good things in four games, piled lots of shots, they just haven’t been dangerous. \nAnd when you’re 23 years old, that is enough to get you scratched even if the team has just won seven points of a possible eight.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:16:24.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
