Even as the Yankees were close to fumbling away home-field advantage in the Wild Card, long after it had virtually ceded the American League East title to the pushy Blue Jays, the 50-year-old acted like the October chill didn't exist, only sunshine. \nThere was more of that from Girardi in his season-ending press conference at Yankee Stadium on Friday. \nGirardi said he was convinced the Yankees, even if they return as presently constituted — and they mostly will, considering how many big-money contracts stifle their flexibility — will be better next season, though he didn't offer many resolutions for the late-season fatigue his stars showed, the unwillingness of Jacoby Ellsbury and Brett Gardner to steal, Masahiro Tanaka's inability to rise to the occasion and the real chance one of their best bats, rookie Greg Bird, won't have a spot next April. \nHere are four more things that didn't make sense. \nPLUS: Yankees' Joe Girardi doesn't exactly give ringing endorsement of Rob Refsnyder \n1.) No prodding of Gardner? : Over a two-month stretch this season, Gardner didn't even attempt a steal. That's right. The No. 2 hitter who's got two seasons of 40 or more steals in his past was less than a non-threat on the bases — he wasn't even trying to swipe bags. But it seemed Girardi never directly asked Gardner, who always has a green light, why he wasn't stealing more, and never directed him to make it a priority. Instead, Girardi said, he simply asked about Gardner's health — a subject he answers as truthfully as a student caught cheating on a test. Naturally, the manager said, Gardner told him he was fine. No progress was made. \n2.) Hasn't thought about his coaches?: The Yankees will likely meet over the next week or two discuss the fate of their coaching staff. But, Girardi said, he hasn't even given thought to whether his whole staff will return. On one hand, sure, if Girardi doesn't want to talk about the status of the people with whom he works closely every day, that makes sense. But for Girardi to say he hasn't thought about it sounded odd. These are men who may or may not have jobs in a couple weeks, and Girardi didn't think about them? A quick look at the staff: the contracts of bench coach Rob Thomson, first base coach Tony Pena and hitting coach Jeff Pentland expire this year. Pitching coach Larry Rothschild has another year left on his contract. \n3.) Why Rob Refsnyder stayed in the minors for the second half : Girardi said after his brief June call-up, the Yankees wanted Refsnyder to work on communicating better with infield shifts and learning the shifts better, in general. While that's understandable, the Yankees then pretty much threw Dustin Ackley — who had only played there once since the start of 2013 — at the position late in the year, without much hesitation. What? \n4.) Need an ace? Girardi dodged whether the Yankees have a true No. 1 in Tanaka or if they need to get an ace on the free agent market — guys like David Price and Jeff Samardzija will be available. Instead, Girardi said he didn't know if Tanaka should be considered a No. 1 or a 2, and that he believes he's in good shape with a deep rotation. \nBrendan Kuty may be reached at bkuty@njadvancemedia.com .
