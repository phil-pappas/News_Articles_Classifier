If it was held in a galaxy far, far away. \nYou remember Sidius, right? The angry horrible guy who served as Darth Vader's boss in Star Wars. Emperor Palpatine. \nHis famous advice to young Luke Skywalker: \"Let the hate flow through you.\" \nOn Saturday afternoon (3:30 p.m., ESPN), with a stiff chill in the air, \"the hate\" is about to start flowing through more than 100,000 people inside Michigan Stadium, and thousands of others who have invaded Ann Arbor for what very well could be the biggest installment of the Michigan-Michigan State rivalry ever. \nThis isn't a rivalry built on respect, or fueled by mutual admiration. It's driven by one thing. \nHate. \nMost of that emotion is transferred from fan-to-fan, as the relief of not losing sometimes trumps the euphoria of winning this game. \nThe players? They, mostly, just want to win a football game. On Saturday, though, there won't be any Sweetest Day gift exchanges. The coaches? Well, Mark Dantonio hates Michigan, we know this. Jim Harbaugh doesn't like anyone who isn't on his team, we know that, too. \nBut, as we established earlier this week, it looks as though the hate will finally take a back seat to an actual football game Saturday afternoon. There's more on the line for both sides in this game than any other fight for Paul Bunyan that I can recall. \nTwo top flight teams going at it, with everything on the line. One wins the chance to be in position for everything, the other gets its heart broken. Two walk in, one walks out. This is college football, this is a rivalry and these are the type of games -- hopefully -- everyone remembers for all the right reasons. \nBuckle up and enjoy. \nKeys to Saturday coming up, right after a message from George Lucas: \n• One example of strength on strength Saturday will come on third down. Michigan leads the country in defensive third down percentage, as opponents are a pitiful 16 of 85 against the Wolverines in this area. \nMichigan State, meanwhile, has been outstanding on third down this year, going an even 40-for-80 -- the top number in the Big Ten. \nPart of Michigan's strength on third down defense, though, comes on first and second down. Northwestern, for example, faced an average of 3rd and 11 over its 13 third down attempts. \nWhat Michigan State does on first down will be interesting. Do the Spartans line up and try to pound the football against Michigan's defensive front? Or do they let Connor Cook come out throwing? Certainly something to watch. \n• This probably goes without saying, but Jake Rudock just can't leave points or big plays on the field in this game. He can't miss open receivers and he can't both wide open chunk play possibilities. \nHarbaugh/Jedd Fisch/Tim Drevno have drawn up open plays against every defense Michigan's played this season, but Rudock's struggled to connect on all of them. The ball has to be on time and he has to give his receivers a chance. \nMichigan State's secondary isn't good, we know this, as the Spartans rank No. 10 in the Big Ten in pass defense. But Rudock can't bail them out by missing targets. It's not a matter of taking a risk or a chance, it's simply a matter of hitting open receivers. \nBecause, if history (on both sides this season) this season tells us anything, Michigan's going to have open looks. If he delivers, Michigan State's in big trouble. If not? Well, things get interesting. \n• If Jack Allen plays at center, one has to assume he'll be hobbled at best after suffering what appeared to be a rather serious ankle injury last week. Either way, a hobbled Allen (or possibly his brother, Brian Allen) against Ryan Glasgow and Maurice Hurst inside is not an ideal situation for Michigan State. \nFor Michigan, this could be the key to the game. If Hurst and Glasgow can continue to own the interior of the line of scrimmage this week, it'll help Michigan take away the run and get pressure on Cook. \nWin that battle, win the game. \nPrediction (Brendan's off this weekend, so it's just me): Nick Baumgardner: There's too much going in Michigan's favor right now for me to pick against the Wolverines on Saturday. Michigan's defense is for real, its home field advantage is for real, its special teams are for real and its coaching staff's ability to duke it out with anyone during a four-quarter chess match is for real. It won't be easy, but it will be a victory for Michigan. -- Michigan 21, Michigan State 14", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T14:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:12:20.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
