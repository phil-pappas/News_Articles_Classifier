Barrett.\nWelcome back, Ohio State.\nThe Buckeyes are back at the top of my Associated Press Top 25 poll, in large part, because of Barrett, who led Ohio State to a rout over Rutgers with three touchdown passes and two more on the ground. This is the Ohio State that I was expecting to see all season.\nQuick note to Ohio State coach Urban Meyer: What in the world were you thinking? Why did you wait this long to give him the starting spot?\nUtah plummets to No. 11, after losing at USC, 42-24.\nThe latest AP Top 25 | USA TODAY coaches' poll Clemson made a huge statement, going on the road and demolishing Miami, 58-0. Clemson moves up to No. 3 on my ballot based on its resume, which includes a win over Notre Dame, a top 10 team in my poll.\nAfter Utah’s loss, Michigan State climbs up to No .6 in my poll. The Spartans flirted with disaster for much of the game against Indiana. But the Spartans do one thing really well: They win .\nAfter two teams fell from the top 10, Iowa slips into the No. 10 slot. The Hawkeyes are undefeated and their victory over Pittsburgh looks better every day.\nThe Wolverines were off this week and I have them ranked No. 16.\nMeanwhile, Toledo just keeps winning. Toledo now has a 10-game winning streak, dating back to last season.\nAnd finally, Pittsburgh climbs to No. 22. Pittsburgh coach Pat Narduzzi might look strange wearing blue and gold, instead of green and white, but he has Pittsburgh playing fantastic. And he took a little bit of Mark Dantonio magic with him, using a fake punt against Syracuse. Hats off to the job he’s doing at Pitt, turning around that program.\nSeidel's AP ballot\n1.
