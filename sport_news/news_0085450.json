Why wasn’t he as effective in the playoffs as he has been in the regular season? Why did John Gibbons burn him in a relief appearance in Game 4? Didn’t he trust his ace? Was Price hurt? Could he not handle the pressure? Was he maybe just pooped? \nThrough all of the second-guessing, Price and the Jays said a lot of similar things. The pitcher said he felt good, and that he was anxious for another chance to set things right, to get his first playoff win as a starter in seven tries. The manager said he was fully confident in his guy — “I don’t give a thought to what he has done in the post-season,” Gibbons said before Game 2 of the American League Championship Series — although he had mused earlier about Price’s heavy workload in 2015. \nBut the only thing that Price could really do to shut everyone up was go out and pitch well on the big stage. \nHe did, for a time. Did he ever pitch well. After a first-pitch single surrendered to Alcides Escobar, the 30-year-old lefthander pitched like, well, like the Cy Young winner he is. He ripped through the Royals for six innings, shutting them out on 66 pitches, 50 of them strikes. The exclamation mark came in the sixth, after the Blue Jays had just scored two runs to open up a 3-0 lead: Price struck out the side. The playoff demons looked fully exorcized. \nBut then, baseball. A shallow fly ball to lead off the seventh inning in which Ryan Goins called off an incoming Jose Bautista, then inexplicably backed off himself, allowing the ball to fall in safe. The crowd at Kauffman Stadium was suddenly alive and into the game, having been watching the baseball equivalent of a funeral for the previous two hours. A single, and then another single. One run was in, but Price still hadn’t thrown many pitches. Kendry Morales hit a ball up the middle that Troy Tulowitzki coralled, but with Eric Hosmer on the move from first, the shortstop couldn’t turn a double play and another run scored. 3-2. \nUnfair or not, Price was staring his playoff history in the face again. It did not end well. Two more base hits, and the Jays were trailing. One more off reliever Aaron Sanchez and it was 5-3 for the Royals. An epic seventh inning to match the one that Toronto hung on the Rangers in the deciding game of the ALDS. \nAnd now, questions again. Is Price, to use the term that Gibbons floated in speaking to reporters on Friday, “gassed”? He came into Game 2 having thrown 230 innings this season between Detroit and Toronto. He had thrown only 50 pitches in his relief appearance against Texas, which meant he should have been plenty fresh against the Royals. For six innings he looked just that, with Kansas City batters barely able to muster balls to the outfield. It wasn’t until the fifth inning that a Royals hitter had even managed a three-ball count. \nBut if the explanation for the sudden turnaround is that Price’s overworked arm suddenly hit a wall, shouldn’t there be evidence to that effect? He was still throwing pitches in the 95-mph range when Kansas City started knocking them back into play. Had they lost some movement and become easier to hit, or had the Royals started to guess better on pitch sequencing? Or, perhaps least satisfying as an explanation: did they just manage to bunch some hits together at the right time? \nThat was the pitcher’s version of events. “I just gave up hits at the wrong time,” Price said after the game. He said he still felt good, but that the Royals kept battling. Asked if it was frustrating to struggle in the seventh when he has sailed through six, Price gave one of his few pointed answers: “It’s frustrating, but I didn’t struggle.” \nGibbons had similar answers: “The balls dropped in,” he said. “So it was unfortunate. You can’t really pitch a better game to that point, anyway. He did a hell of a job.” \nNone of that changes the fact that Price, with his 2.30 ERA in 11 starts with Toronto in August and September, has a 7.20 ERA in three October appearances with the Blue Jays. It was never going to be easy for Toronto to cruise into the World Series, even though they dominated their opponents so thoroughly late in the season. But now Price, the ace, the stopper, cannot buy a complete performance. At what point is he going to feel comfortable that he has finally locked down a win as a playoff starter: when he goes a full nine innings, or when the Jays score a dozen? (Even then, the way things have gone: maybe not.) \nThe can’t-do-it-in-the-playoffs label is almost always grossly unfair, the product of small samples in which randomness has a much greater effect. John Elway couldn’t win a Super Bowl until he won two. Randy Johnson stunk in the playoffs until he didn’t. Barry Bonds, Alex Rodriguez, Clayton Kershaw: chokers right up until the point where they were heroes. \nPrice remained defiant on Saturday night. \n“It’s baseball,” he said. Sometimes the balls miss bats, sometimes they do not. Sometimes they find gloves, sometimes they do not. The Royals hit three balls hard in the fifth inning, and recorded nothing but three outs. They put nothing at all in play in the sixth. And then the seventh: the pop fly that fell, the double play that wasn’t, ball after ball that just kept evading Blue Jays. The win was so close, and then it was gone. \n“Good things are going to happen,” Price said after the game. \nFor him, and for his team, they need to happen fast. \nPostmedia News © Copyright (c) National Post Original source article:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:46:15.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
