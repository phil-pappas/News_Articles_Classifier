That's somewhat understandable since he spent the past three seasons with the Chicago Bears , and was traded to play in The Big Apple back in March.\nSo he trolled NY and Chi-town fans to help him decide his way out of this pickle. Marshall declared however many more tweets he got for either the Mets or Cubs, that would finalize his decision.\nNY family, where you at? Help me pick a baseball team. RT if you say Mets! Taking the team with the most RTs.\n— Machine Marshall (@BMarshall) October 16, 2015 Chicago family, where you at? Help me pick a baseball team. RT if you say Cubs! Taking the team with the most RTs.\n— Machine Marshall (@BMarshall) October 16, 2015 As more tweets came in favor of New York, Marshall tweeted his pledge to the Mets. But apparently dude hasn't watched baseball in a long time. Only because he tweeted a pic of him with a Yankees hat with Mets colors.\npic.twitter.com/4KQnde9gOE\n— Machine Marshall (@BMarshall) October 17, 2015 Really bruh?? Perhaps he's color-blind to royal blue and orange colors and/or really bad at Photoshop. #FAIL\nSend all complaints, compliments, and tips to sportstips@complex.com .\n[via CBSSports ]", "external_links": ["http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/eye-on-baseball/25343482/whoops-jets-brandon-marshall-supports-mets-with-yankees-hat", "https://twitter.com/BMarshall/status/655111505050910720", "https://twitter.com/BMarshall/status/655458299077337088", "https://twitter.com/BMarshall/status/655111595857588224", "http://t.co/4KQnde9gOE"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:20:14.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
