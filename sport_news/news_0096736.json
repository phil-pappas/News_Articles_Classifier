The Utes picked up a regular-season first-place vote – the first time in school history – in the latest Associated Press college football poll, making it's the earliest top-10 appearance in program history. \nBYU also had a chance to make a splash on national television, as it went on the road with its No. 22 ranking to face the Michigan Wolverines. Unfortunately for the Cougars, the team left with more questions than answers after suffering a humiliating 31-0 loss before a crowd of 108,940 at the Big House. \nUtah tight end Siale Fakailoatonga runs over Oregon linebacker Johnny Ragin III during the second half of an NCAA college football game.

Both teams finished with 6-2 records in the Mountain West Conference last year, good enough for a second place finish behind Boise State, who just so happened to win the Fiesta Bowl last season. \nSo with that, here is all the information you need for the upcoming games this week. \nBYU vs. CONNECTICUT, Friday, 8:15 p.m. (ESPN2) \nThe last time BYU was shutout, was a 3-0 loss to Utah in the 2003 Holy War. Before that, the last time the Cougar offense didn't score a point was back in 1975. After managing just 105 yards of total offense, the Cougars will need to quickly adjust with a Friday night showdown against Connecticut. \n\"It was a hard game in terms of how we played. There were certainly a lot of correctable things in terms of simple execution, consistency or communication,\" BYU coach Bronco Mendenhall said about the loss to Michigan. \"I still like our team, and there are some good things I took away from the game. Somewhere between the first three games and this last game is where our team really is.\" \nBYU defensive lineman Bronson Kaufusi (90) talks with Michigan head coach Jim Harbaugh after the game in Ann Arbor, Mich., on Saturday.

Unfortunately, it didn't translate to the field as the Cougars gave up 254 yards on the ground to the Wolverines. \nThe good news for BYU, is that UCONN comes into the game without much of a run a game, and with one of the worst offenses in the country. \nDespite a poor showing last week, BYU is still favored by more than 18 points against the Huskies. Friday's game could be the perfect medicine to get freshman quarterback Tanner Mangum back on the right track after going up against the toughest schedule through the first four games of the season. \nSecond Time \nBYU is facing UConn for just the second time in school history. The Cougars topped UConn 35-10 in the 2014 season opener after totaling 513 yards of total offense. \nHome Sweet Home \nThe team returns home after back-to-back road games and playing three out of four on the road to start the season. BYU won its home opener against Boise State with a 35-24 comeback win. The Cougars start a series of four straight home games with UConn, East Carolina (Homecoming), Cincinnati and Wagner. \nWin No. 300 \nBYU's record in Provo is 299-134-6 since 1922. A win over UConn will give the Cougars their 300th program win in Provo. Since moving into LaVell Edwards Stadium, BYU is 226-69. Under Mendenhall the Cougars have gone 51-11 at home. \nWashington's Dwayne Washington looks to break a tackle against Utah State during the first half of an NCAA college football game.

Both teams come into Saturday's contest in need of a victory, and a win would certainly put the Aggies in the driver's seat heading into an Oct. 16 battle against Boise St. \nColorado St isn't the same team it was last year, but it does have talent and it starts with wide receiver Rashard Higgins and running back Jasen Oden Jr. The duo combined have more than 600 yards of total offense and five touchdowns. If the Aggie defense can contain these two playmakers, they will have a great shot to win. \nOn offense, the Aggies will start sophomore quarterback Kent Myers, who is stepping in to replace Chuckie Keeton. Myers is no stranger leading the offense after going 5-1 as a starter a season ago. Incredibly, despite the numerous injuries to Keeton, the Aggies are 14-5 over the last two years with a backup quarterback. \nConference Openers \nUSU starts conference play at home for the second-straight year and is 2-0 all-time in Mountain West openers. \n10 Straight \nUtah State has won 10 straight home games, which is tied for the fourth-longest home winning streak in school history. The school record is 17 straight home wins from 1959-63. \nHome Dominance \nUtah State has won 19 of its last 21 home games overall, including seven straight Mountain West home games and 12 of its last 13 conference home games. Under head coach Matt Wells, USU is 11-2 at home, including a 7-1 Mountain West record. \nFollow Justin Giles on Twitter @Justingiles22 or on Facebook at www.facebook.com/JustinGilesSportsWriter \nRelated Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:13:06.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
