Daily Messenger sports editor Bob Chavez joins long-time columnist Bill Pucko to discuss the Buffalo Bills. Bill: Finally, we got a competitive football game to watch. Which isn't to say it was a well-played game. Buffalo was fortunate to escape Nashville with a win on Sunday . Quarterback Tyrod Taylor pulled it out of the fire almost singlehandedly. We spoke last week about how the Bills, then a loser to the New York Giants, needed to learn how to win. This week they were on the other side of the equation against the Tennessee Titans, who couldn't close. Bob: It was an ugly win, for sure, but if you've been watching the Bills for the last few seasons, you understand why the Bills and their fans will take it. For one, the Bills were too often on the wrong side of the score in close games. And second, we've seen the Bills win by big margins and now a tight one. Experience like the kind they gained on Sunday is invaluable when it comes to learning how to perform under pressure. So in that regard, it was as pretty as it gets. Bill: I'm not one who generally screams at a television but that offsides call on Marcus Easley on the opening kickoff, negating a fumble that would have given Buffalo the ball at the Titan five yard line, was brutal. You knew right then it wasn't going to be easy. And it wasn't. Bob: No, it wasn't easy and the 3-0 halftime score made me think they were playing the Browns. But I'll go back to the first point I made in that it was nice to see Buffalo maintain its composure after that setback. To their credit, overall, the Bills cut back on penalties and won a game that they really needed to win if they want to play beyond the regular season. Bill: I don't know why this is, but doesn't it seem that it takes a team two weeks to actually miss missing players. Buffalo was without playmakers Sammy Watkins, LeSean McCoy and McCoy's replacement Karlos Williams. The Bills made do a week ago but Sunday they were inept without them. It's like the first week out, the team rallies around itself. But after that, well, you get what you got. For Taylor, it was a case of realizing in the second half that if it was going to get done, he was going to have to do it. A team record 76 yards on the ground for a quarterback was the statistical backbone of a spectacular game for the new quarterback, but they can't play week in and week out that way. Bob: The Bills definitely need more consistency. They haven't lost consecutive games this season, but they haven't won consecutive games either. The offense did look awful against the Titans, but it was easy to understand why considering the names you bring up. But it's reassuring to see Taylor do what he did. It's almost as if he were waiting for the green light from the coaches and once he got it at halftime, his mind was made up. Page 2 of 2 - Bill: If Buffalo expects to be in the playoff hunt it has to win games like that. The best of teams always seem to get a couple of wins they don't really deserve. The Bills host unbeaten Cincinnati Sunday and catch the Bengals at a good time, after an emotional win over a good team and then heading on the road. A lot of times it's as much when you're playing as who and when. This is a good example. The game is rated a tossup. Bob: Sammy Watkins is expected back and Karlos Williams remains a maybe, and that's key. If Buffalo has any shot at winning this one, it's going to need to establish a running game. Not a scrambling game like Taylor did, because there's a difference. I'm leaning toward Cincinnati for this one. The Bengals are playing very well but the x-factor here is which Andy Dalton shows up to play.
