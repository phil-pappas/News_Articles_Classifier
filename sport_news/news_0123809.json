To be able to have both No. 1 teams here, playing in New Jersey on the same day, I think it's great. \n\"The only thing that would be better is if both Rutgers and Monmouth were No. 1 playing in New Jersey.'' \nWhile Callahan said he is anticipating \"an electric atmosphere'' for his program's Homecoming affair, Rutgers coach Kyle Flood said \"Saturday night will be the best atmosphere in all of college football'' when his team plays host to the top-ranked Buckeyes. \nPLUS: Kyle Flood expects raucous atmosphere for Ohio State \n\"It's an exciting week for our program,'' Flood said. \"We really enjoy being back in High Point Solutions Stadium. Our nighttime environment is one of the best in the country. We're looking forward to that.''

Now in their second year in the Big South Conference, the Hawks stand at 3-4 overall heading into their matchup against the Chanticleers. \n\"I think the curious football fan will want to see what this Coastal Carolina football team is all about,'' said Callahan, who owns a 129-106 record in 23 seasons. \"Hopefully they'll come out to watch our game and then hop in the car and go up to Rutgers for the 8 o'clock start up there. The people that really love college football it gives them the opportunity to see the No. 1 teams on both levels.'' \nKeith Sargeant may be reached at ksargeant@njadvancemedia.com .
