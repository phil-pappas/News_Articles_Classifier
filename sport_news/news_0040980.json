Armas, The Associated Press The State Journal-Register By Genaro C. Armas, The Associated Press Posted Oct. 11, 2015 at 4:50 PM Updated at 6:51 PM By Genaro C. Armas, The Associated Press Posted Oct. 11, 2015 at 4:50 PM Updated at 6:51 PM GREEN BAY, Wis. — The St. Louis Rams will go down in the NFL record book as the team that ended a remarkable streak by Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. They would much rather be leaving with a win at Lambeau Field. Rams quarterback Nick Foles struggled against constant pressure and threw four interceptions on Sunday, including one returned for a score in a 24-10 loss to Green Bay. \"I've got to make better decisions to give my teammates an opportunity to make a play,\" Foles said. He would have loved to have played like Rodgers, even if the Rams ended the MVP quarterback's run of mistake-free football at home. Rodgers was 19 of 30 for 241 yards with two long scoring strikes to receivers Ty Montgomery and James Jones. But NFL-record streaks of 587 pass attempts and 49 touchdown passes at home without an interception for Rodgers ended in the first quarter on linebacker James Laurinaitis' diving pick of a tipped ball for the Rams (2-3). \"How long has it been since Aaron's thrown an interception here, 500 attempts? We said what we need to do (was) someone needs to get their hand on the football, get the ball and someone make a play,\" Rams coach Jeff Fisher said. It happened two more times: Rodgers threw another interception in the second quarter before losing a fumble in the third. \"Well, I mean, Aaron is human,\" said coach Mike McCarthy. \"He's still a remarkable player. What happened today doesn't change that.\" The defense backed up Rodgers with big plays all day long. Relentless pressure on Foles helped keep the Packers (5-0) unbeaten. Foles' four interceptions were a career worst, with two coming in the fourth quarter inside the Packers 10. Foles was 11 of 30 for 141 yards and a touchdown. His longest completion came on a 68-yarder to Stedman Bailey late in the fourth quarter. Otherwise, the Packers' pass rush overwhelmed an inexperienced offensive line that lost veteran guard Rodger Saffold in the first quarter to a shoulder injury. Star linebacker Clay Matthews had 1 1/2 sacks. Rookie cornerback Quinten Rollins returned an interception 45 yards for a touchdown for a 14-0 lead in the first quarter, and picked off another pass at the 7 with 23 seconds left. Safety Ha Ha Clinton-Dix intercepted a tipped pass in the end zone on third-and-goal at the 7. \"I think we just all complement each other well, offense, defense, special teams,\" Rollins said. \"All three games complement each other well, so that makes the game a lot easier.\" Greg Zuerlein was 1 for 4 on field-goal tries, hitting from 42 but missing two others and getting a fourth one blocked. The misses all came from at least 50 yards. The mistakes wasted another strong effort for Rams rookie Todd Gurley, who for the second straight week had his best production, with 159 yards rushing on 30 carries. Page 2 of 2 - \"We've just got to be consistent and to finish,\" Gurley said. \"Put some points on the board — a field goal, something.\" But a week after defeating previously unbeaten Arizona, the Rams couldn't repeat the feat on a warm fall afternoon in Green Bay. The Packers defense held up in spite of losing tackle B.J. Raji to a groin injury and linebacker Nick Perry (shoulder). Guard T.J. Lang also left in the first quarter with a knee injury. For the Rams, defensive lineman Chris Long did not return after hurting his right knee in the first half. By Genaro C. Armas, The Associated Press The State Journal-Register By Genaro C.
