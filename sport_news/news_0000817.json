With our gambling Defense, these games against the explosive offenses just seem like a roll of the dice with tough odds. Oregon isn't as explosive as USC, but they have Adams back at QB and are a different team with him in the line up. http://www.dailyemerald.com/2015/10/...ent-direction/ The good news is that their defense isn't exactly overwhelming. One of the these games, our offense is going to get on track. Will this be the night? It will help having Richard back in the line-up. His absence was huge against Utah. I am not optimistic, but am hoping we see the same ASU team that beat UCLA. The difference may be that Adams is much more mobile than Rosen and could improvise and burn us.
