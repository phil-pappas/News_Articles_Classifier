Christopher Moore rushed for 122 yards and two touchdowns on 14 carries to help finish a 7-0 season. \nThe Eagles, which advanced to the championship game with last week’s semifinal win over Lee, used a defensive stop on a fake punt to set up their opening score. \nTwo plays after taking over on its own 42-yard line, Madras got on the scoreboard with a 40-yard strike from Jake Barberio to Mason Bervaldi with 3:02 left in the first quarter. \nEast Coweta stormed right back, however, needing two plays to go ahead for good. \nCorey Bridges connected with Jayland Rivers on a 72-yard pass play to push East ?Coweta a ahead 7-6 with 1:34 left in the first quarter. \nNeither team managed to score in the second quarter, but East Coweta easily could have pulled away. \nThe Indians had two long runs by Christopher Moore called back for penalties two plays apart. As a result the game went to the half with the Indians still leading 7-6. \nEast Coweta successfully pulled away to open the second half, scoring on consecutive drives. \nMoore went in from 31-yards out with 6:27 to go in the quarter and made it 13-6 after a missed PAT. After the Eagles ran one play the Indians Austin Bunn intercepted Barberio to set his offense up at the Eagles' 27-yard line. Two plays later Moore scored again, from 25-yards out to extend the lead to 19-6 with 5:13 to go in the third quarter. \nEarly in the fourth quarter Madras recovered a fumble that gave the Eagles the ball near midfield. Three plays later Barberio broke several tackles to score from 10-yards away and cut the Indians’ lead to 19-12 with 6:47 left in the game. \nEast Coweta answered on the ensuing drive going down the field in five plays capped off by a 16-yard run by Marshay Walker to make it 25-12 with 4:47 to go. \nMadras drove to near midfield on their last posses- sion of the game, but failed to convert a fourth-and-long allowing East Coweta to take over at the 38-yard line of the Eagles where they managed run out the clock. \nINDIANS 25, EAGLES 12 \nEast Coweta 7 0 126 —25 1st Quarter \nM — Jake Barberio pass to Mason Bervaldi 40-yards (missed PAT), 3:02 \nEC— Corey Bridges pass to Jayland Rivers 72-yards (Dylan Lewis kick), 1:34 \n3rd Quarter \nEC— Christopher Moore 31-yard run, (missed PAT), 6:27 \nEC— Moore 25-yard run, (missed PAT), 5:13 \n4th Quarter \nM — Barberio 10-yard run, (missed PAT), 6:47 More", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:02:25.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
