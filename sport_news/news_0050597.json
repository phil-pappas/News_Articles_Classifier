He kicked off his five-year term on Wednesday by symbolically taking over the power from his SPD predecessor Juergen Nimptsch, who retired after six years in office.\nNimptsch announced at the end of last year that he will not seek another term when his current term expires in October.\nIn his maiden address to the city council, Sridharan pledged to work for building up Bonn as a location for investments, as a centre for international conferences and as a European hub of UN agencies and institutions.\nHe said he would engage himself together with the German federal government to attract more UN institutions and non-governmental organisations to the former German capital, which already hosts about a dozen UN agencies. â€”PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:20:19.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
