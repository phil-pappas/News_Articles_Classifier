Arizona (3-2, 0-2) at Stanford (4-1, 3-0) \nScore: Stanford 55, Arizona 17 \nGame recap: Quarterback Kevin Hogan and the rest of the 16th-ranked Stanford team got off to a quick start and never gave Arizona a chance to catch up. At halftime, the Cardinal led 27-3. Even a pair of third-quarter touchdowns weren't enough for the Wildcats, who were scoreless in the first and fourth quarters. \nKey stat: Hogan earned his career-best completion rate (89.4 percent), finishing 17-of-19 for 217 yards and two touchdowns. \nConference implications: The Cardinal is standing tall five weeks into the season. The offense is explosive with a dominating O-line, a near perfect quarterback and an exquisite running game. Though the season started off shaky, Stanford is leaving the past in the past and is currently leading the Pac-12 North. \nWhat looked promising for the Wildcats in the first three games of the season now looks a little grim. Quarterback Anu Solomon missed the game with a concussion that he suffered last week against UCLA. Luckily, the Wildcats can make a comeback after starting conference competition 0-2 as they gear up for Oregon State and Colorado. \nNext opponent: Arizona hosts Oregon State; Stanford enters its bye week and hosts UCLA Oct. 15. Arizona State (3-2, 1-1) at UCLA (4-1, 1-1) \nScore: Arizona State 38, UCLA 23 \nGame recap: Arizona State outperformed 20th-ranked UCLA and kept the Bruins scoreless in the first and third quarters. At halftime, the Sun Devils led 15-10. They started the second half with back-to-back touchdowns and by the fourth quarter, UCLA was down 19 points. A late push wasn't enough to save the Bruins' undefeated season. \nKey stat: The Bruins converted just 3 of 14 third-down attempts. \nConference implications: The fact the Sun Devils took away UCLA's undefeated record isn't earth-shattering. Arizona State knew what it had to do against the Bruins to get the W, and the Sun Devils did just that. A win at the Rose Bowl against an unbeaten team may be just the beginning of what the Sun Devils can do. \nUCLA's momentum has stalled for the time being. The Bruins get to spend their bye week convening before they face Pac-12 North leader Stanford. \nNext opponent: Arizona State hosts Colorado; UCLA enters its bye week and travels to Stanford Oct. 15. Oregon (3-2, 1-1) at Colorado (3-2, 0-1) \nScore: Oregon 41, Colorado 24 \nGame recap: The Buffaloes kept up with the Ducks for most of the game and even entered halftime tied at 17. Once Oregon started to take the lead, Colorado crumbled. Three Colorado turnovers resulted in 14 Oregon points, sealing the first conference win for the Ducks. \nKey stat: Along with three catches for 32 yards, Oregon running back Royce Freeman scored two touchdowns on 27 carries for 163 yards. \nConference implications: Oregon's running game is good. Oregon's secondary is not. The unit gave up 231 passing yards and 308 total yards to the Buffs. Next for the Ducks is pass-happy Washington State, so it's time for the secondary to pull it together. Otherwise, the Ducks will leave their fans with ruffled feathers. \nReduce turnovers and Colorado would've had a shot beating Oregon. Things are going well for the Buffs this season. Each game they're learning lessons, and it's time to fix those mistakes. It may seem like a long shot, but they are three games away from bowl eligibility. \nNext opponent: Oregon hosts Washington State; Colorado travels to Arizona State. Washington State (2-2, 0-1) at California (5-0, 2-0) \nScore: California 34, Washington State 28 \nGame recap: The 23rd-ranked Bears and Cougars gave a show that would be categorized as a drama if it were a movie. Down 21-13, quarterback Jared Goff rallied California to a 34-28 lead. Then there was the time the Cougars allowed the Bears to convert a third-and-36 on a draw play. \nKey stat: Goff completed 33-of-45 passes for 390 yards with four touchdowns and one interception. \nConference implications: The Bears are 5-0 for the first time since 2007. While the Goffense — if you will — has looked pretty seamless this season, ranking 10th in the nation for total offense, the Bears are off to compete in the conference's battle of the best. They meet fifth-ranked Utah in Salt Lake City in front of an ESPN \"College GameDay\" crowd to decide who will remain the only undefeated team in the league. \nRefreshed from its bye week, Washington State looked to start its conference play with a win. The Cougars let go of the opportunity, giving up a double-digit lead. They'll have to take advantage of home games because a tough schedule still remains with road trips to Oregon, Arizona and UCLA. \nNext opponent: California travels to Utah; Washington State travels to Oregon.
