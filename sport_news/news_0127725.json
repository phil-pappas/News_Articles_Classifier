Lake Norman Charter (5-6-1, 4-2 Big South Conference) at Forestview (7-4-1, 5-1), Wednesday Oct. 7 6:00 p.m. Through the first half of conference play in the Big South, three teams have established themselves as the class of the conference: Ashbrook, Forestview and Lake Norman Charter have played one-goal games in each of their meetings so far this season. Forestview defeated Lake Norman Charter 2-1 in overtime in the teams’ first meeting this year on Sept. 14. That loss dropped the Knights to 1-5-1 on the year, but Lake Norman Charter rebounded with three straight conference wins to get back near the top of the conference standings. The Jaguars will have to find a way to manage without forward and senior captain Jorge Oquendo this week. Oquendo was shown a red card in Thursday's loss at Ashbrook for celebrating a goal in the first half - the punishment for a red card is ejection from the contest and a two-match suspension. Hunter Huss is currently tied with the Knights for third place in the Big South. The Wolves could put themselves in the conversation among the conference’s best with a win Monday over Ashbrook – Huss is the only conference team with two remaining games against the Green Wave.
