If there is something that could be worked out, we will listen. We were ready to move the game to Saturday. But we cannot accept the two options that were presented.” \nDelaware Valley has also accepted a forfeit from West Scranton, after agreeing to play either Saturday or Sunday, but would not go into next week, principal Brian Blaum said. \n“Unfortunately, we were forced to come to this decision in the best interest of our kids,” Blaum said. “I know the Scranton School District appreciated our willingness to work with them, but we simply ran out of time.” \nRead The Times-Tribune on Friday for more details.
