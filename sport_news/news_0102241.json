We had a great (defensive) plan from Coach (Larry) Vincent, but there were a lot of seniors out there making key plays for us, especially on defense. It was really a team effort, I’m just really proud of them.” \nBrownsville Veterans got on the board quickly on its first drive. The Chargers drove down the field and quarterback Marcus Castillo scored on an 8-yard run to take a 7-0 lead. \nHanna went down the field on its ensuing drive, but the offense stalled and it had to settle for a 37-yard field goal from Andy Lopez to cut the deficit to 7-3. \nThe defensive units for each team kept their opponents in check until the Golden Eagles finally broke through in the second quarter. Jaime Gonzalez capped off a drive with a 5-yard touchdown run to give the Eagles a 10-7 lead that they took into halftime. \nBut that was all Hanna got against the Chargers. \n“We playing good teams, we’re playing well, but we’re (off) a play here and (off) a play there,” Hanna coach Rene Medrano said. “It’s a tough district and everyone is pretty evenly matched. My hat goes off to (Brownsville Veterans), they made some plays when they had to and we let some slip through our hands. That’s just the way it is.” \nDuring the second half, Brownsville Veterans’ defense limited the Eagles’ offense and finished with five sacks as they kept constant pressure on Lopez. \n“That was the key, getting pressure on Lopez,” Cantu said. “Because when he sets his feet, I feel like he’s the best passer in the Rio Grande Valley. He’s absolutely amazing, and it’s beautiful to watch him play. (The) Hanna (offense) deserves a ton of credit.” \nAndrew Crum covers sports for The Brownsville Herald.
