It's easy to see the record and say, 'They suck.' But we don't, we're a good team and we know that.\" \nIndeed, Cornell was just a play or two from victory in each of its first three games, which ended in single-digit losses to Bucknell, Yale and Colgate. The last two weekends haven't produced nearly as high drama, with back-to-back losses to Harvard and Sacred Heart by a combined 71-9. \nBut ever the optimist, third-year coach David Archer is -- to coin a worn-out phrase -- taking 'em game by game, and that starts at 12:30 p.m. Saturday at Schoellkopf Field, against Brown. \n\"As hard as it is as a human being, you have to block out the record,\" he said. \"You can't go back and change it. ... We're just looking forward to (Saturday) and the great opportunity that Brown presents. They're going to be a real challenge.\" \nAt this point, any team the Big Red (0-5 overall, 0-2 Ivy League) faces will present some sort of challenge. Cornell has won just once in its last 15 games dating back to the beginning of last season and is just 4-21 under Archer, a 2005 Cornell graduate and member of one of the last Big Red teams to have a winning Ivy record. \nIronically, in trying to drive home the point that the past doesn't matter, Archer this week gave his players a brief history lesson. \n\"I told them, 'Here's the truth,'\" he said. \"In the last 14 or 15 years, we've had one winning record overall, and two winning records in the Ivy League. One was in my senior year (2004), and one was the year after that. Since then, the last time we were 5-2 in the Ivy League was 2000, when we had (quarterback) Ricky Rahne and (wide receiver) Joe Splendorio.\" \nThe black-and-white of Big Red football over the past decade and a half has been mediocre -- nine times over that span, Cornell finished with two or fewer Ivy victories -- but in laying all that out, Archer stressed that this year's story is yet to be fully written. \n\"I know it's important for this senior class to leave their mark on this program,\" he said, \"and one great way to do it is to jack up those Ivy win totals. And we have five straight Ivy games staring at us.\" \nIt's easy to characterize the second half of the season as five opportunities for victory, but obviously it's much harder to actually put them into the win column. And Cornell's job against a Bears squad (3-2, 1-1) that is coming off a last-minute win over previously unbeaten Princeton figures to be much harder if it has to play without its offensive catalyst. \nSenior running back Luke Hagy, who rushed for better than 100 yards in each of the first three games before being shut down by unbeaten Harvard, suffered a concussion on the second play from scrimmage last week in the 31-6 loss at Sacred Heart. He hasn't practiced all week, and his status for Saturday was uncertain as of Friday afternoon. \nThe Red struggled offensively at Sacred Heart without Hagy, amassing just 66 rushing yards and 280 yards all told. Still, Sullivan has confidence that his team will figure out a way to move the football. \n\"He's Luke Hagy, he's an incredible playmaker, but we have great confidence in some of the younger guys,\" he said. \"I know they're excited and ready to step up. We'd love to have Luke on Saturday, but we know that we can be productive with other guys, too.\" \nAlso on the shelf all week have been freshman running back Chris Walker (concussion) and senior wideout Chris Lenz (ankle). \nJunior back Johnny Pena scored from 7 yards out with 57 seconds to play to lift Brown past Princeton, 38-31, last Saturday. The Bears also benefited from a huge special-teams touchdown, as junior Alex Jette opened the game with a 99-yard kickoff return for a score. \nFifth-year senior quarterback Marcus Fuller leads the Ivies in passing yards per game at 308.8 while completing 66 percent of his passes with seven TDs and five interceptions. \n\"Everything goes through him,\" Archer said, \"and the receiver Jette, he's a really good player. They've got things clicking, great chemistry.\" \nBrown is last in the Ivies in scoring defense at 31.8 points allowed per game, much of that due to a 53-27 loss to Harvard in week 2. \nCornell plays three of its final four games on the road, beginning next Saturday at Princeton.
