The Thai side lead the way in Group F with seven points after three games, two ahead of 2007 Asian champions and group favourites Iraq, with Vietnam a point further behind in third. A win for the Thais at My Dinh stadium in the Vietnamese capital would significantly enhance their chances of snatching the top spot and automatic qualification for the final qualifying round. The Thais have lost only once in their last seven visits to Vietnam, who they also beat 10 at home in the group opener in May. However, the Vietnamese head into the game on the back of an impressive showing in a 1-1 draw at home to Iraq, who needed a last-gasp penalty to salvage a point last week. That failed to deter the Thai team's confidence, with assistant coach Krairung urging the hosts to adopt an attacking approach against his side. \"We always play attacking football so I would like to ask Vietnam to play in the same way for the supporters of both teams. We've worked very hard because every country in the region wants to beat us. We have no concern, though. We're confident we could take home three points. \"They did well against Iraq. But, that match was in the past. Let's see what will happen. Personally, I believe if the two sides play offensively it would be an interesting game,\" former national player Krairung said yesterday. Veteran goalkeeper Sinthaweechai Hathairattanakool is eyeing revenge for the 3-2 aggregate loss to Vietnam in the final of the ASEAN Championships in 2008. \"We obviously want to win every single game we play. This game is no exception. One of the reasons is we want to exact revenge for our defeat in 2008. If we stick to our game plan, I'm confident we would win the game,\" said the Chonburi FC keeper. Meanwhile, midfielder Mongkol Tossakrai, who shot to fame with a late equaliser in the 2-2 home draw against Iraq last month, believes his side could cope with the pressurecooking atmosphere at the intimidating My Dinh stadium. \"Honestly, a trip to Vietnam does affect us a bit psychologically but it's not the first time we face this situation.\" Thairath TV will televise the match live from 7pm. 281 Viewed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:53:25.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
