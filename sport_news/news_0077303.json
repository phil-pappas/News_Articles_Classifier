Having conceded the T20 series, Dhoni's men have clawed their way back to set up a tantalising series decider after winning in Chennai. India's bowlers backed up a long-awaited century from Virat Kohli as the hosts defeated South Africa by 35 runs on Thursday to level the five-match one-day series 2-2. Kohli smashed 138 off 140 balls to lift India to 299-8 after Mahendra Singh Dhoni elected to bat in the must-win international at the Chidambaram stadium in Chennai. The tourists managed only 264-9 in reply despite a heroic 112 off 107 balls by skipper AB de Villiers even as the other batsmen folded in the stifling heat and humidity. Seamer Bhuvneshwar Kumar claimed three wickets and off-spinner Harbhajan Singh took two to set the stage for the decisive final match at the Wankhede stadium in Mumbai on Sunday.\"The mood is great, especially considering we beat them in Chennai which was a must-win game for us. We hadn't played good cricket collectively, until Chennai. It was important to get a collective performance in. Now, due to the rule changes game awareness is important. We figured what had to be done and we were able to execute it, which is a good thing. All the batsmen are in a very good mental space,\" said Kohli who was personally looking forward to the virtual final.\"This Wankhede pitch should have more carry and bounce. A game like tomorrow's is something that I personally like to be a part of. You want to be performing in big games and winning for the team. That feeling after you make a significant contribution to the team's win is something that, as a sportsman, is hard to replicate in any aspect of life,\" he added. Kohli struck six boundaries and five sixes in his 23rd one-day century, the first after a gap of 13 innings since scoring the match-winning 107 against Pakistan in the World Cup match in Adelaide in February. South Africa badly missed all-rounder JP Duminy and fast bowler Morne Morkel who were ruled out of the key game due to injuries. \"It's been a very exciting and close ODI series. We've managed to win four games out of six and its good for us. Both teams have been competitive and it will be exciting,\" said South African batsman Hashim Amla.
