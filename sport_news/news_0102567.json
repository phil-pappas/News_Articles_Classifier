They are off to their worst start since going 1-9 in 1956. \nTCU beat Texas in consecutive years for the first time since 1958-59, outscoring the Longhorns 98-17. \nBoykin threw for 332 yards without playing in the fourth quarter, and his 74 career TD passes are three more than Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton had from 2007-10. \nThe Horned Frogs had a 220-1 lead in total yards late in the first quarter after receiver Shaun Nixon threw a 29-yard scoring pass to Doctson on a trick play for a 30-0 lead. \nBoykin threw backward to Nixon, and Doctson was well behind Texas cornerback Davante Davis when he caught Nixon's soft toss as he crossed the goal line. It marked the first 30-point quarter against the Longhorns since they gave up 31 in the fourth of a 60-40 loss to Houston in 1987. \nDoctson and Turpin each had a flashy score. Doctson soared over Holton Hill on a leaping catch in the back corner of the end zone, and Turpin fooled safety P.J. Locke III with a cut inside from the sideline on a 49-yard score. \nTurpin, who had six catches for 138 yards, also had a 50-yard score to put TCU up 37-0 at halftime. His others touchdowns were from 13 and 12 yards. \nAfter special teams mistakes cost them chances to win late in losses to California and Oklahoma State, the Longhorns buried themselves with early blunders. \nKyle Ashby snapped the ball over punter Michael Dickson's head for a safety a week after Dickson dropped a perfect snap to set up Oklahoma State's winning field goal in the final seconds. \nOn the ensuing free kick, Nick Rose's kickoff went out of bounds, giving the Horned Frogs the ball at the 50. Five plays later, TCU went up 16-0 on a 15-yard pass to Doctson, who had seven catches for 129 yards. His 23 career TDs are one more than Josh Boyce had from 2010-12. \nA TCU defense missing six starters because of injuries and other issues slowed Jerrod Heard for the second straight week after two explosive games from the Texas freshman quarterback. \nHeard was 8 of 20 for 48 yards and had 23 yards on 12 carries before getting replaced by former starter Tyrone Swoopes with TCU leading 47-0 lead in the third quarter. \nThe Longhorns return to the Dallas area next week for the annual Red River rivalry against No. 15 Oklahoma. \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T22:52:19.534+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
