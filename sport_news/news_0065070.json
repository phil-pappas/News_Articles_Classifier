A Sports Illustrated article stated that the 70-year-old told his team of his plans Monday evening. More >> COLUMBIA, SC (WIS) - \nAccording to a multiple sources, South Carolina head coach Steve Spurrier is retiring. \nSources say Spurrier told the team Monday night. When no one gave me a chance to play D1 football, Coach Spurrier did. I am forever honored and grateful to play for the one and only HBC! — Perry Orth (@PerryOrth10) October 13, 2015 \nSpurrier entered this week with an overall coaching record of 228-89-2. The Gamecocks are coming off their latest setback, a 45-24 loss to LSU in Baton Rouge. In 11 years at South Carolina, Spurrier amassed an overall record of 86-49 during his tenure, including three straight 11-win seasons and four straight bowl wins. \nSpurrier also led the Gamecocks to 18 wins over teams in the AP Top 25, including their victory over top-ranked Alabama in 2010 along with six other top-10 wins during his time manning the USC sidelines. \nWith 131 SEC wins, Spurrier stands in second place behind Paul \"Bear\" Bryant for most conference wins. \nDuring his tenure at South Carolina, Spurrier had 35 players draft by teams in the National Football League. \nPrior to the start of the season, Spurrier held an impromptu news conference after questions surfaced regarding his age and his ability to run the Gamecocks' program. \n\"There's been some questions in the past week, two weeks, maybe the last month, about coach Spurrier's age and how much longer he's going to coach at South Carolina,\" Spurrier said. \"Now last year I was 69, we were 11-2 and there was no question about my age. But now that we're 7-6, we've got some enemies out there.\" \nSpurrier went on to warn fans not to listen to \"enemies\" ahead of the Gamecocks' season opener in Charlotte against North Carolina. \nAt this point, an interim coach has not been named. However, one is expected to be named on Tuesday. \nThe team will hold a news conference on Tuesday at noon. I'm so lucky to have had Steve Spurrier as my coach at Florida. He moved me from QB to WR and taught me the game. Thanks my friend. — Cris Collinsworth (@CollinsworthNBC) October 13, 2015 \nCopyright 2015 WIS. All rights reserved.
