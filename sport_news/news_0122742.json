Photo provided Thursday afternoon turned out to be a pretty big day in the life of Fort Dorchester offensive lineman John Simpson. Simpson, one of the state’s top offensive line prospects who was named to the South Carolina Shrine Bowl team last week, received his Army All-American Bowl jersey in a ceremony at the school on Thursday. During the ceremony, the South Carolina Football Coaches Association released its list of five finalists for the 2015 Mr. Football award and Simpson was included on that list as well. Other finalists for the Mr. Football award include Chapin quarterback Logan Bailey, Spartanburg running back Tavien Feaster, Conway wide receiver Bryan Edwards, and Dorman quarterback Collin Hill. The Mr. Football award will be announced Dec. 4 as part of the Palmetto Champions dinner. In past years, the winner was announced at halftime of the North-South All-Star Game. “Big day for big John,” Fort Dorchester head coach Steve LaPrad said. “John deserves every honor he gets because he has worked so hard — on the field and in the classroom.” Simpson joins Goose Creek defensive lineman Javon Kinlaw on the roster for the Army All-American game, which will be played Jan. 9 in San Antonio, Texas, and will broadcast nationally on NBC. “This means a lot really,” said Simpson, who joins former Fort Dorchester star and current St. Louis Rams defensive end Robert Quinn as an Army All-American. “I never thought I was capable of achieving this. It’s a great honor and I am really proud of myself and my coaching staff for helping me get this far.” Kinlaw, also a Shrine Bowl selection, received his Army All-American jersey in a ceremony at Goose Creek on Wednesday. “It’s a great honor and a great opportunity to show what I can do against the best players in the country,” Kinlaw said. “I’m looking forward to it and looking forward to playing with John. It’s kind of cool to have two players from right around here in the game.” Though he has been recruited mostly as a defensive player at Goose Creek, Kinlaw says he will play offensive tackle in the Army All-American game. He admits to the possibility he could end up on offense at the next level. “I’ve always considered myself a defensive player and I like being on defense, but whatever they need me to do is fine,” Kinlaw said. “It’s kind of new to me but I feel like I can learn and adjust to it. I’ll do the best I can.” Enlarge Goose Creek defensive lineman Javon Kinlaw. \nGoose Creek defensive lineman Javon Kinlaw. ×", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:27:27.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
