(Photo: Rick Osentoski, USA TODAY Sports) \nAs the Michigan football machine has rolled the past few weeks, there was always a caveat. \nWhat about against a team that’s not tired from traveling cross country? What about one without a high school coach? Or one about to get fired? \nOn Saturday, it was: what about an elite defense and one that is ranked in the Top 15. \nThese may be mere footnotes by the end of the season, as the No. 18 Wolverines made a definitive statement Saturday, whipping No. 13 Northwestern, 38-0, at Michigan Stadium before and announced attendance of 110,452. \nThe game launched Michigan’s stellar defense into historic territory with its third straight shutout, the first time for the program since 1980. \nAs with the win over BYU two weeks earlier, the Wolverines took control in the first half and put it on offensive cruise control in the second. \nIt only took 13 seconds for U-M (5-1, 2-0 Big Ten) to provide an answer, as Jehu Chesson took the opening kickoff back 96 yards for a touchdown. \nFrom there, the Wolverines did whatever they wanted. \nThe next two drives were quick, effective marches, each under four minutes, with the Wolverines toying with the nation’s No. 1 scoring defense. \nOn the first offensive drive, a 32-yard Jake Butt catch and one-yard Drake Johnson run gave the Wolverines their first offensive score, pushing the margin to 14-0.
