Paul Sullivan Contact Reporter Even President Barack Obama is jumping on Cubs'bandwagon thanks to Joe Maddon's magic. \nTrust is something an outsider has to earn in a parochial town like Chicago, but it didn't take long for everyone to start believing in the gospel of Joe. \nFrom the day at the Cubby Bear last November when Joe Maddon told everyone he would be \"talking playoffs\" in 2015 through Wednesday's fist-clenching, pulse-pounding 4-0 triumph over the Pirates in the wild-card game, Cubs fans put their faith in his unconventional moves and watched them work like a metronome. \nEven some die-hard White Sox fans are pulling for the Cubs to pull this off, including a former Chicagoan now working in Washington. \nI sent a message to President Barack Obama asking if he would put his loyalties aside and pull for the Cubs this postseason. \nThe answer arrived before the game began. \n\"With the Sox out, I'll be rooting for the Cubs to win the Series,\" Obama said via email. \"They're due. They've got great young players, and I'm a Maddon fan. That's an official statement.\" \nIf the Cubs do get to the World Series, don't be surprised if the president stops by Wrigley Field to catch a game, not that we're getting ahead of ourselves or anything. \nThe Cubs still have a long way to go, starting with the National League Division Series against the archrival Cardinals, which begins Friday evening at Busch Stadium. \nPhotos from the National League wild-card game in Pittsburgh. \n\"We'll be ready,\" Jake Arrieta said. \"We're going to have two tough games in St. Louis. Hopefully we scratch out a win, hopefully two, and then take it to Wrigley and let the home crowd see us play.\" \nThe Cubs have taken on Maddon's personality, with further evidence being the seventh-inning brouhaha after reliever Tony Watson hit Jake Arrieta in apparent retaliation for two batters Arrieta hit. \n\"We don't start stuff, but we end stuff,\" Maddon said during a recent kerfuffle with the Cardinals. \nHis players heard those words. Now they live by them. \n\"I know people back in the day used to say getting into fights or whatever would bring your team closer,\" said David Ross, who was in the thick of the scrum. \"I don't think we need to be any closer. \n\"Look around. Chemistry on this team is not any problem. Getting into a fight I don't think helps us. But it obviously doesn't hurt us. We're going to stand up for our guys, and we're going to make sure the other team knows we're going to stand up for our guys. If that means going on the field and taking care of business, that's what we have to do.\" \nOf course, the last thing the Cubs needed was someone to get hurt in a fight. \n\"You always have concern,\" President Theo Epstein said. \"But pretty quickly you could tell calmer heads would prevail. It was draining. It was emotional for those guys going through that. There was some real (stuff) going down there today.\" \nAnd it all started with Maddon letting his players be themselves, a novel idea that brought out the personality of this team and turned it into a dominant force. \nTo envision this all happening without Maddon is impossible. \nYou can't quantify the number of victories a manager is responsible for, but the Cubs did make a 24-game regular-season improvement over last year. \nThe Cubs made the right move to fire Rick Renteria, even though President Theo Epstein said it was a \"moral dilemma\" because Renteria had done nothing to lose his job. \nLast October, when Epstein and general manager Jed Hoyer met Maddon at a trailer park in Pensacola, Fla., to offer him the job, Maddon looked at the talent in place and the ones on the tarmac waiting to take off. \n\"And then you look at it, and (you think), 'Man, this could be pretty good rather quickly,' \" he said Wednesday. \"In the end, having Jon (Lester) there really solidified it, and nobody thought Jake was going to be this good this year. I can understand why everyone thought why it was going to take a little while longer.\" \nThere's more work to do, more games to play and more moments to savor. But the gospel of Joe is spreading, to the White House and beyond. \n\"To see the hard work of all those people manifest itself in the young, exciting gutsy winning major-league team before our eyes is incredibly special,\" Epstein said. \"And Joe and his staff and the players have taken it to a whole other level.\" \nMaddon told his players not to let the pressure exceed the pleasure. \nIt did on Wednesday, and the pleasure was ours.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:32:46.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
