Williams will next meet either Jelena Jankovic or Daria Gavrilova. \n“I’m not thinking of winning that match only,” Williams said. “My goal here is to win the tournament.” \nAngelique Kerber and Samantha Stosur also advanced, and will face each other in the semifinals. Stosur beat Heather Watson 4-6, 6-3, 6-0 while Kerber defeated Caroline Garcia 7-5, 6-3. \n“I lost my way at the outset but being a three-set match, I didn’t let it bother me,” said Stosur, the 2011 US Open champion. “It doesn’t matter if you don’t start fantastic, what matters is how you finish.” \nElsewhere, Agnieszka Radwanska will take on Karolina Pliskova in the semifinals of the Tianjin Open. The second-seeded Radwanska rallied from a 3-5 deficit in the opening set against Elizaveta Kulichkova of Russia to win 7-6 (3), 6-2. \nThe third-seeded Pliskova had 11 aces in a 6-3, 6-2 win over Hungary’s Timea Babos. \nRadwanska can qualify for Singapore if she wins the Tianjin title. Pliskova is further back, four spots out of the final place in the tournament. The other semifinal will pit Bojana Jovanovski of Serbia against Danka Kovinic of Montenegro.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:30:34.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
