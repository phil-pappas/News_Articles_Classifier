Ten percent of the end-of-year grade will now depend on attendance and behaviour.\nStudents, who protested in several governorates including Cairo, Giza, and Menofiya, also demanded that all questions in the final exams be based solely on the curriculum, not just the 70 percent the current exams include.\nStudents have launched a Facebook campaign against the new system called \"Students of the 2016 thanaweya amma against the 10 attendance marks\".\n\"We won't keep quiet about this unfair new system,\" the campaign statement reads.\nThanaweya amma students must take highly competitive and complex tests in order to continue into tertiary education. Which institutions accept them depends on their marks.\nDue to education conditions in Egypt, many students resort to expensive private lessons and choose to avoid overcrowded and understaffed classes.\nTests in recent years have been marred by cheating and the leaking of exam questions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:32:44.582+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
