The umpires reviewed the play but determined there was not enough evidence to rule fan interference.and upheld, giving the Royals an early 2-0 lead.\nRoyals fan, Caleb Humphreys, a 19-year-old fan from Blue Springs, Missouri, became an instant celebrity. Humphreys kept the ball and was hounded by reporters, including Fox's Erin Andrews on the national broadcast.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:23:14.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
