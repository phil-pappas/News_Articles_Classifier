Coach James Franklin called that among the team's more underrated strengths.

(Gene J. Puskar / AP) \nThe Lions are plus-8 in turnover margin, third in the Big Ten and tied for eighth nationally. Indiana comes to Beaver Stadium at plus-9, tied with Michigan State for the conference lead. \nPenn State has recovered an astonishing eight fumbles, though Army gifted three last week with unforced drops in wet conditions. Still, there's no doubt that Penn State has protected the ball much better than in the pre-Franklin years.. \nRunning backs coach Charles Huff shifted Penn State to a \"high-and-tight\" method of carrying the ball last year, which has reduced fumbles drastically. The Lions' backs have lost just two fumbles in the past 18 games and none this year. \nThe offense's only turnovers are two Christian Hackenberg interceptions, the last of which came against Rutgers. Having played three of its five games in rain makes the turnover margin even more noteworthy. \nFranklin attributed the success to two factors: daily ball-security drills and a particular offensive strategy to limit turnover possibilities. \n\"We are going to call the game in a style that allows us to be successful, allows us to win, allows us to manage some of our issues,\" Franklin said. \"I said that, I said that four weeks ago, and I think that's really kind of what we are doing.\" \nKEYS TO VICTORY \nPENN STATE NITTANY LIONS \n1. A healthy-ish Saquon Barkley. If it's not scoring, the offense at least needs to win the time-of-possession and field-position contests. Barkley offers the best chance to do that. \n2. Stretching the field. Might be time to chase a few more downfield throws (20 yards or more) to free some space for the short passing game. \n3. Quarterback pressure â€” whoever it is. Indiana's Nate Sudfeld has been pretty good, but injured, while Zander Diamont is a unique run threat. Penn State intercepted Diamont twice last year, though. \nINDIANA HOOSIERS Offensive line big reason why Indiana off to 4-0 start in football Chuck Burton / The Associated Press Indiana's Jordan Howard averages nearly 142 yards rushing per game. Indiana's Jordan Howard averages nearly 142 yards rushing per game. (Chuck Burton / The Associated Press) \n1. A healthy-ish Jordan Howard. The Hoosiers might need Howard more than the Lions need Barkley. The UAB transfer is a power back in a power game who has rushed for 709 yards and makes first downs on almost 30 percent of his carries. \n2. Aggressive pass defense. Penn State's passing game can be curtailed, as several teams have proven. Indiana has 12 sacks (while allowing just three) and five interceptions. \n3. Nick Mangieri on the loose. The senior defensive end, who has 5 sacks and 3 pass breakups, will require some tight-end help to corral. \nFIVE THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW \n1. Penn State's offense has scored two or more regulation touchdowns just twice in Big Ten games under James Franklin: against Illinois last year and Rutgers this year. \n2. In going 8-0 at home against Indiana, the Lions have averaged 39.75 points per game. They have scored at least 28 in each game and 38 or more five times. \n3. True or redshirt freshmen have scored eight of Penn State's 13 offensive touchdowns. Running back Saquon Barkley leads with four. \n4. Indiana has the Big Ten's leading offense in points (36 per game) and yards (498.2) and ranks second in passing (273.8). \n5. Prior to last week's loss to Ohio State, Indiana started the season 4-0 for the first time since 1990. \nPREDICTION \nLions caught Rutgers at the right time. Perhaps the same will hold true against injured Indiana. \nPENN STATE 17-14", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:56:59.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
