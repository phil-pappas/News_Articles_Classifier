A neighborhood coalition asked for a higher tax. An economist warned of unintended consequences. And neighborhood leaders worried that the tax, as worded, would promote more infill development.\nHales, responding to criticism that there hadn't been enough public process, said his latest proposal was just that – a proposal.\n\"I'm happy we are where we are,\" he said after the meeting.\nIt's unclear what the new tax proposal will look like.\nOne of the biggest sticking points has been the type of demolition that should be taxed.\nLast month, Hales' office said the tax would apply to all demolitions of habitable homes on property zoned for single-family housing. That meant demolitions resulting in the construction of one new mega home or two or more homes.\nBut last week's plan essentially limited the tax to just one-for-one replacements , a pro-density change that Hales' office said was necessary to secure political support from the City Council.\nAnd now?\n\"If we do them at all,\" Hales said of a tax on demolitions, \"we should do them in both situations.\"\nPrice is another issue. Hales originally proposed $25,000, plus $25 a year for the age of a home that's demolished. The age add-on was removed last week, aide Jillian Detweiler said, because it was complicated and wouldn't result in much extra revenue.\nNow, United Neighborhoods for Reform is recommending a $35,000 tax instead.\nHales' office also rolled out a possible $25,000 rebate last week for demolitions that lead to affordable housing or added density. Now there's talk of exempting affordable housing altogether, and ensuring that longtime homeowners hoping to build a new house on their property aren't penalized.\nAt the same time, officials don't want to discourage demolitions of homes in poor condition, even if they're habitable. And they don't want to create a loophole for demolitions masquerading as a remodel.\n\"By all means, let's not prevent some improvements,\" said Commissioner Amanda Fritz, later adding: \"Can we tailor something that may not be one-size-fits-all?\"\nMeanwhile, housing economist Jerry Johnson said the $25,000 tax wouldn't be of any consequence on demolitions leading to $1 million homes in Eastmoreland, but it would create hardships in low-income neighborhoods.\n\"The way this is currently structured,\" he said, \"there's a lot of potential for that.\"\nSome, such as Maryhelen Kincaid, a member of Portland's Development Review Advisory Committee , said they just want an opportunity to provide suggestions.\n\"This all caught me by surprise,\" she said.\nFinally, there's the tax itself.\nThe Oregon Home Builders Association submitted a letter Tuesday objecting, saying Portland \"lacks the legal authority to impose this tax.\"\nWhen City Council members asked a city attorney to address the issue during Wednesday's public session, the attorney shook his head.\nHales acknowledged that a tax, however crafted, is just one piece toward addressing Portland's housing crisis. Money from the tax would be dedicated to affordable housing.\nBut demolitions, while high-profile, are fairly rare: in 2014, there were 181 demolitions in neighborhoods zoned for single-family housing, according to the city.\nEven so, Hales said few cities nationwide have tried to combat demolitions. Portland, he said, should try: \"This is, if we do it, an innovation.\"\n-- Brad Schmidt\nbschmidt@oregonian.com\n503-294-7628\n@cityhallwatch", "external_links": ["https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bds/46405", "http://unitedneighborhoodsforreform.blogspot.com/"], "published": "2015-10-15T02:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:14:33.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
