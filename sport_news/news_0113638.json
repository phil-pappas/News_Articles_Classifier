Six of those technical fouls came in the third quarter when there were noticeable flare-ups. \nBlake Griffin got his arm tangled up with Shaun Livingston, who was whistled for a loose-ball foul. The two faced one another and exchanged words. On the other end of the court, Draymond Green was called for an offensive foul after charging into Griffin. Green and the Clippers' Lance Stephenson were called for double technical fouls on their way back down the court. \nLater, Chris Paul was assessed two technical fouls in a row while barking at an official and was ejected. \n\"I've got two kids of my own,\" Paul was heard on the television broadcast telling the official. \"Don't talk to me like I'm a little kid.\" \nJason Thompson picked up a technical after a hard foul of the Clippers' Austin Rivers.

Walton said he has looked good in practices. \n\"We see a lot more in practice than we do in games where it's just scripted minutes,\" Walton said. \"He's looked great in the preseason and has added post-up moves to his game. He's shooting the ball better. He's ballhandling better.\" \nIn a survey of NBA general managers conducted by NBA.com , more of the executives think the Cleveland Cavaliers and San Antonio Spurs will win the championship this season than the Warriors. \nWalton joked about how some general managers make mistakes. \n\"What draft pick did we get Steph? OK, so at least six of them don't know what they're doing,\" Walton said, smiling. \"What pick did we get Draymond at?\" \nThe Warriors got respect as well with most general managers voting the Warriors to finish first in the Western Conference and team with the best home court advantage, Curry as the best point guard, Iguodala as the bench player that makes the biggest impact and Ron Adams as the best assistant coach. \nThe Warriors for the second year in a row were voted most fun team to watch and Curry as the best pure shooter. \nAsked once again what he meant by his comments about the Warriors and luck needed to win the championship, Clippers coach Doc Rivers said, \"I've answered this 100 times, so I'm pretty much done with it, you know? I think everyone knows what I said.\" \nPlayer development coach Steve Nash, a Los Angeles-area resident, attended shootaround.
