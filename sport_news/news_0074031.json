Compared to teams in the past, the key difference has been the improved showing of our big men Amjyot Singh and Amritpal Singh.\"\nBoth Amjyot and Amritpal are professionals in the Japanese developmental league, and their exposure abroad is showing immediate dividend.\nIn today's game though, India started off strong against Philippines, winning the first quarter 17-16. However, the hot-shooting of Philippines kicked in during the second quarter and it took a 42-36 lead into halftime.\nIn the second half, the tired legs of India couldn't keep up, as a rested and deep Philippines team took off on large runs.\nCaptain Vishesh Bhriguvanshi led the team with 21 points, including 5-10 outside shooting, while Amritpal matched former-NBA player Andre Blatche blow for blow with 18 points and 13 rebounds. Star hoopster Amjyot had an off-night with 11 points and 5 rebounds.\nResult:\nIndia (Vishesh Bhriguvanshi 21 pts, 3 rbs & 3 asts; Amritpal Singh 18 pts & 13 rbs; and Amjyot Singh 11 pts & 5 rbs) lost to Philippines (T Romeo 20 pts & 4 asts; A. Blatche 15 pts & 5 stls; and R. DeCampo 13 pts) 65-99 (17-16, 19-26, 14-23, 15-34).
