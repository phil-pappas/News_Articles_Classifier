It would be awesome to thrash a V8 Supercar around Bathurst as the only car on the track. \n“That’s the plan. We will see how that goes but not everything goes to plan at Bathurst. \n“But it proved last year it doesn’t really matter where you start – it just matters if your car is quick.” \nAnd Mostert’s Ford is certainly that. \nHe sits second in the championship standings (2017pts) behind teammate and 2013 Bathurst champ Mark Winterbottom (2215). \nHe finished second at the recent enduro Sandown 500 (with co-driver Cameron Waters) behind Winterbottom, paired with Steve Owen. \nMostert and 21-year-old Waters will become the youngest-ever combination to claim victory in Bathurst 1000 history if they triumph this year. \nCraig Lowndes (then 22) and Greg Murphy (then 24) hold the record for their 1996 heroics for Holden. \nMostert’s Prodrive Racing team are vying for their third straight Bathurst triumph, launching a stunning five car assault on the mountain including David Reynolds, who sits third in the championship. \n“It’s a massive attack on the mountain,” Winterbottom said. \n“We have power in numbers, power in history and results. \n“Hopefully the combination will get us another trophy. \n“Whichever car it is, I think we have a good shot.” \nPractice starts on Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T11:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T17:43:02.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
