Nguyen, who opened the Classic with a 1-under 71 Saturday, finished the weekend with a 74 for a two-day total of 1-under 145 to finish ahead of University of Redlands’ Amberlynn Dorsey. The team leaderboard was headed by host George Fox (311-312—623) with third-place Whitman (322-314—636) only three strokes behind Redlands (315-318—633) in second. Molitor’s reference wasn’t only aimed at being the hunted, following Saturday’s under-par round. Sunday’s grouping with Nguyen included the Division III national player of the year from the previous season, Fox’s Sydney Maluenda, and the current season’s stroke-average leader, Redlands’ Caroline Ordian. “That was just an impressive medalist performance,” Molitor said of Nguyen’s accomplishment. “You don’t always know exactly where you are in the standings out there, though you have a good idea. But you do know who you’re playing with and Phoebe simply never faltered against that head-to-head competition. Ordian was fourth at nationals last year and this season had yet to shoot an over-par round, until today.” Aiding Nguyen in Whitman’s team performance were outstanding Sunday rounds from teammates Shiyang Fan (seventh, 79-76—155), Alyssa Maine (tied for ninth, 81-76—157) and Kendall Dunovant (91-88—179). And finishing out her first collegiate tournament, after returning from an injury, was Whitman’s Charlotte Simons, who chopped off 13 strokes from Saturday’s round to finish with a two-day total of 221. “Not only were those three outstanding rounds today from Alyssa, Shiyang and Kendall, but to do so in such an outstanding field of players makes the weekend’s results even more noteworthy for us,” Molitor said. “That pair of 76s from Alyssa and Shiyang were wonderful drops from yesterday’s scores, and Kendall was able to get her putter going better today, cutting 12 putts from yesterday! We’re very excited about the momentum we’ll be taking into the Fall Classic.” The Northwest Conference Fall Classic this weekend at Meadows Golf Course in Sunriver, Ore., is one-third of the season championship formula used within the league to determine it’s conference champion in the spring. The Spring Classic and NWC Tournament are the other two. Whitman men in eight place after first round of Whitworth Invite SPOKANE — The Whitman College men’s golf team finished in eight place in the first round of the Whitworth Invitational on Sunday in Spokane. The Missionaries combined to take 347 strokes, 59 over par, five ahead of last-place Pacific with the Invitational continuing Monday. Daniel Hoffman led Whitman, with a 5-over 77, good enough for a tie at 18th place on the individual leader board. Teammate Carl Felstiner shot an 11-over, Mario Santos-Davidson carded a 20-over, Will Selman 23-over, Andrew Schwartz 24. The tournament continues today.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:01:19.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
