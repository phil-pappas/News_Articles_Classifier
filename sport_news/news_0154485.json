Opener Kedar Devdhar (17 batting) and skipper Aditya Waghmode (4 batting) were at the crease when stumps were drawn. For Tamil Nadu, left-arm spinner Rahil Shah (1-2) was the lone wicket-taker as he cleaned up debutant Hitesh Solanki (5, 1x4).\nOn a dry wicket that had uneven bounce and ample assistance for the spinners, the hosts chose to bat after winning a crucial toss but were at sea right from the word go. There were never allowed to settle in as offspinner Yusuf Pathan (4-29) and left-arm spinner Bhargav Bhatt (4-32) proved more than handful. After medium-pacer Sagar Mangalorkar (1-8) cleaned up Tamil Nadu skipper Abhinav Mukund (1), playing his 100th first-class game, the duo of Bharath Shankar (28, 4x4) and No 3 B Aparajith (44, 4x4, 2x6) added 65 for the second wicket. That passage of play was the best for the hosts as they maintained a 124-minute vigil at the wicket. Yusuf was guilty of grassing a regulation catch of Bharath Shankar at second slip when the batsman was on 9. Barring that miss, Baroda's fielding looked sharp right through the day.\nThe game literally turned on its head in the 33rd over when Bhatt cleaned up Bharath, and then got the prized wicket of Dinesh Karthik (1) - bowled round his legs - to leave Tamil Nadu at 68 for 3. \"Bharath and Aparajith batted well. But we knew if they get out-then batsmen coming in next would find it difficult to score. That's what happened,\" Bhatt said at the end of the day's play.\nB Indrajith (14, 1x4) joined his twin in the middle, but failed to stay long - caught at forward short-leg by Hitesh Solanki off Yusuf to a delivery that rose sharply from good length. By now, the hosts were 89-4. Aparajith, who was looking good for more, gave his wicket away soon after. Medium pacer Murtuza Vahora (1-10) was brought in and Aparajith tried an expansive drive off a half-volley and nicked one to keeper Pinal Shah. R Prasanna (21, 3x4) was the only other batsmen to enter the double figures as Baroda bowled out Tamil Nadu in 57.4 overs after a delayed start following a morning drizzle.\nDespite the Tamil Nadu spinners troubling the batsmen towards the end of play, Bhatt was confident of taking control of the game on Friday. \"I think we have some good players of spin in our side such as Deepak Hooda, Hardik Pandya and Yusuf and they (TN) will be employing slow-ball bowlers. I am sure if one of them gets set, then we will take charge,\" Bhatt said.\nScoreboard: Tamil Nadu 1st innings: Bharath Shankar b Bhatt 28, M Abhinav b Mangalorkar 0, B Aparajith c Shah b Vahora 44, D Karthik b Bhatt 1, B Indrajith c Solanki b Yusuf 14, R Prasanna b Yusuf 21, J Kousik c Waghmode b Yusuf 1, R Malolan c Shah b Bhatt 5, L Vignesh c Hooda b Yusuf 2, R Shah c Solanki b Bhatt 0, DT Chandrasekar n.o. 0; Extras (b5, lb4) 9; Total (all out in 57.4 overs) 125; FoW:1-1, 2-66, 3-68, 4-89, 5-95, 6-98, 7-105, 8-108, 9-121, 10-125; Bowling: Mangalorkar 8-4-8-1, Vahora 11-6-10-1,Swapnil 11-3-32-0, Pandya 4-2-5-0, Bhatt 13-4-32-4, Yusuf 10.4-2-29-4\nBaroda 1st innings: Baroda 1st innings: K Devdhar batting 17, HK Solanki b Shah 5, A Waghmode batting 4; Extras (b1, lb1, pen 5)7; Total (For 1 wicket in 16 overs)33; FoW: 1-22; Bowling: Vignesh 3-0-16-0, Kousik 5-3-2-0, Shah 5-3-2-1, Malolan 3-1-6-0 ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-02T05:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:41:04.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
