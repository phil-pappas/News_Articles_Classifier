If you didn't like a coach, you just sold him out to the NCAA. The coaches at either end of the greatest SWC rivalry of the '60 vacationed together. Darrell Royal and Frank Broyles didn't talk football on the golf course anyway.\nMost of my life, the only rivalry in Texas was the Longhorns vs. everyone else. But that's so 20th century.\nNow that Baylor and TCU qualify as the Big 12's elite, as well as national title contenders, each has shifted its focus from Austin. There are several reasons for the mutual hostility besides the fact that both are vying for the role of David and his slingshot.\nWhat really brings this old church school rivalry to a boil is the personality of Patterson, who's not much on hiding his feelings. Briles is pretty much just along for the wild ride.\nCoaching styles seem to be at the root of the brand new Bielema-Kingsbury rift. Kingsbury says he was insulted on behalf of all Texas high school coaches who run the spread offense because of remarks Bielema made at the coaches convention. Bielema, who favors a power running game behind the world's largest offensive line, reportedly said that if you don't line up a fullback, he'll kick your rear. Or something to that effect.\nKingsbury was probably spoiling for a fight ever since the Razorbacks ran for 438 yards in a 49-28 win last year in Lubbock. When Kingsbury counterpunched after the Raiders' 35-24 win this year, Bielema basically said his career record beats Kingsbury's.\nMaybe this sort of conduct, once considered impolitic, is a natural outgrowth of the times and social media. Most people born after 1995 don't know what it means to let a thought go unexpressed.\nOf course, Bielema isn't exactly shy, and he's more clever than the highly combustible Patterson. Last year, leading up to the Texas Bowl, Bielema may or may not have flashed the \"horns down\" signal. Also called a 31-7 whipping of Texas \"borderline erotic.\" And he made headlines this fall by criticizing Ohio State's nonconference schedule.\nBielema is so brash in order to draw the attention of recruits, the same reason his Razorbacks will play A&M on Saturday at JerryWorld.\nUnfortunately, the gains Bielema made last year have since been wiped out by losses to Toledo and now Tech, and he's paying for his remarks.\nNot that any columnist should mind what he or Patterson or Kingsbury says to provoke a rivalry. Hey, it's all good. To get this kind of theater, you usually have to follow Steve Spurrier around.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KSherringtonDMN"], "published": "2015-09-23T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:27:26.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
