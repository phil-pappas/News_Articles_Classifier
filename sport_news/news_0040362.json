(Photo: Tony Centonze/For The Leaf-Chronicle) \nTrying to avoid a third straight loss, Clarksville looked sluggish to start with three fumbles as Northeast jumped out on the Wildcats. \nThe Eagles' Quinton Cross scored early on a 2-yard touchdown run at the 11:40 mark in the first quarter. Cross also carried in the Eagles' second score of the night, an 11-yard run, with 5:33 left in the opening quarter. \nBut from that point on, it was all CHS. Despite the fumbles the Wildcats were able to hold Northeast scoreless for the remainder of the game. Brevon Johnson cut the lead to 14-7 after a 1-yard run with 10:21 left in the fourth quarter. Quarterback J.J. Jones took in a touchdown run that tied the game at 14 midway through the final period. \nBut the biggest moment of the night came from Clarksville kicker Caden Patterson, who executed two onside kicks that the Cats were able to recover. The first came at the start of the second half to surprise the Eagles (3-5, 1-4), and the other would result in a fourth-quarter field goal to give them their first lead of the night, 17-14. \nClarksville improved to 6-2 on the season and more importantly 3-2 in region play. That keeps the Wildcats in the fourth, and final, playoff spot with two more games remaining. The Wildcats will face Dickson County in two weeks and wrap up the regular season at Brentwood.
