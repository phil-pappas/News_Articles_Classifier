A strong back-nine saved Choctaw’s Amber Ritchie. Meanwhile Crestview’s Katy Dale and Jordan Stutler were solid enough. Now each is advancing to Tuesday’s Region 1-2A showcase at Holiday Golf Course in Panama City. The Vikings – buoyed by just an eight-stroke split between the Nos. 1-4 golfers – carded a runner-up 365 to finish two strokes off the pace of champion Arnold. Kristin Allen posted a team-best 87, followed by an 88 from Maddie Williams and a pair of 95s from Audrey Vaughn and Karina Caraballo. Ritchie, a state qualifier last year, rebounded from a front-side 45 – she suffered a double bogey on No. 1 and later a triple on a par-3 –with a 38 to finish second individually. “All year long she’s been our lowest scorer,” said Choctaw coach Andy Snaith, whose Indians didn’t compete as a team with only three golfers. “She just had two bad holes on the front side but she put it together on the back. But she’s done that for the whole season. Maybe we need to get her more time on the range.” Snatching up the other two individual qualifying spots (scores used outside the three qualifying teams), Dale shot a 93 and Stutler a 95 to move on. “I’m proud of both of them,” said Crestview coach Kenny Rogers, whose team only had three golfers. “When you compete and advance as an individual, that’s a great accomplishment.” Other non-qualifying scores were: Fort Walton Beach’s Kaitlin Jones carded a 96; Choctaw’s Lexi Gomez shot a 99 and Maggie Keeling a 114; Jillian Parker posted a 114 for Crestview.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:18:52.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
