Fallen trees and power poles will isolate residential areas. Power outages will last for weeks to possibly months. Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months,\" the NHC says of a landfalling Category 5 system.\nTo put it in context, Patricia’s winds are equal to the speed of a bullet train.\n[ View the story \"5 things that travel slower than the winds of Hurricane Patricia\" on Storify ]", "external_links": ["https://t.co/Ebc8eP7B2J", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Patricia?src=hash", "http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPEP5+shtml/231448.shtml", "https://twitter.com/WMOnews/status/657474133505085440", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Haiyan?src=hash", "https://www.facebook.com/NWSNHC/posts/955432881188859", "https://www.facebook.com/NWSNHC"], "published": "2015-10-23T09:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:34:42.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
