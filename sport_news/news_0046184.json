According to Army Marksmanship Unit's (Mhow) commanding officer Colonel Lalit Sharma, the army is leaving no stone unturned to convert the Olympic quotas won by their shooters into medals.\nIn order to boost their shooters' preparations, the Centre, for the first time has got a 'blind sanction' for funds. \"Army has always had an e-sanctioned budget for pre-sanctioned budget for shooting. Considering the importance of Olympic medals and the chances we have at Rio, we have got a 'blind sanction' of funds for our qualified shooters,\" said Colonel Sharma. \"It means there is no fixed budget for the medal prospects and funds will be made available as and when they require anything which can help them train better.\"\nRoughly, army will spend Rs 3 crore per shooter by the time Rio Games come. So far, three army shooters out of eight overall, have qualified for the Rio Games. The army has borne Vijay Kumar's expenses for four World Cups, as the London silver medallist was not able to shoot the Minimum Travel Score, made mandatory by NRAI to get eligible to travel abroad on government's funding. Sharma, told TOI that other than providing basic things like guns, ammunition, training and ranges, army is also organising specialist workshops for their shooters.\nEarlier, the army was considered as a unit closed for the outside world. Be it the coaches, physios or even masseurs, they have always had a well-trained team for their athletes. Taking a step ahead, the AMU is now open to outsourcing services of specialists for their shooters.\nThough army is spending freely on its shooters, there is no scope of non judicial expenditure. \"Every single penny is judicially spent,\" he said. Army shooters like Jitu Rai and Vijay Kumar are also getting funds from sports ministry's TOP scheme. But Sharma said: \"Irrespective of the sources of fund, for us, it is ultimately government's money. Whether the money is spent by the army or by the sports ministry, we monitor our shooters' account and make sure there are no discrepancies whatsoever.\" Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-13T20:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:00:47.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
