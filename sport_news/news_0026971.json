The Bears' kiddie corps at safety of Adrian Moss and Harold Jones-Quartey again avoided the spotlight and made enough plays to get another win. \nFangio is clearly an excellent coach who is making this defense far bigger and better than the sum of its parts. \nAt the end of the day, however, the main plotline in the Bears’ heroic victory over the Chiefs is once again the play of Jay Cutler. \nSure, Matt Forte’s huge, but he’s an All-Pro giving the team what it expects. \nMartellus Bennett struggled in Kansas City, and while Marquess Wilson, Josh Bellamy and Cameron Meredith all made big plays, none have done enough to convince us they have futures with the team. \nHroniss Grasu went from awful to impressive in 60 minutes, and Kyle Long was outstanding. \nBut for the better part of Sunday, Cutler was an elite quarterback. Who can honestly say they saw that coming? \nIs it thanks to Adam Gase? John Fox? \nIt “aint exactly clear” yet but they’re obviously not hurting. \nAnd here’s one more thought. Eddie Goldman, Grasu, Jeremy Langford, Amos, Patrick Omameh, McPhee, Acho, Jones-Quartey, Porter and other contributors all have one thing in common – none of them were here last year. \nIt seems Ryan Pace has something to do with this as well. \nHear me folks, it’s early. This is still a .500 team on its best day. Not every Sunday will go the way this one did. \nBut what’s happening here is that Pace and Fox know they’ve got a rebuild on their hands, and their plan might just be a little bit ahead of schedule right now. \n• Chicago Football editor Hub Arkush can be reached at harkush@chicagofootball.com and on Twitter @Hub_Arkush.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:38:09.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
