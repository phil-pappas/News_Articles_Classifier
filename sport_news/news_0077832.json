He is a great pitcher, always has been, but not in the post-season. Clayton Kershaw had this reputation, too, but he was a monster this year. Well, Price will pitch the biggest game of his life on Friday night. He has a theory about the other ones.\n“You know, trying to be too good, trying to be maybe too fine or whatever it is,” said the 30-year-old left-hander, the day before his Toronto Blue Jays play the Kansas City Royals in an elimination Game 6. “I know what I’m capable of doing, I think everybody in this room knows what I’m capable of doing. And I think I just kind of want to do it too bad.”\nAs this Jays season reaches another apex, Price is at the centre of it. He’s had a strange trajectory to the end of the year: a bad start against Tampa Bay on Sept. 26, 11 days off, a desultory start in Game 1 against Texas, a desperation three-inning relief appearance in Game 4. And then his Game 2 start in this series, where he was nearly perfect for six innings and boiled over in the seventh, out of nowhere. It felt like a prophecy was being fulfilled, or something.\nAnd then in Game 5, with Toronto facing the void again, there was Price, taking the starter’s lumbering, longer route to getting ready in the bullpen. He stayed there, though. Since manager John Gibbons had defended the Texas relief appearance by saying that if Price got hot you used him, there are suggestions from respected baseball writers that this is pitching malpractice. Some think Price is unhappy with how he is being used.\n“I’m not upset with how things have transpired throughout the playoffs,” Price said Thursday, in Kansas City. He explained that he understood about Toronto’s thin bullpen, with left-handers Brett Cecil hurt and Aaron Loup in and out with a family matter. Loup is expected in Kansas City Friday night.\n“And I understand that, I get it, and at this point in the season you’ve got to be ready for whatever,” Price said. “I mean, if I would have gotten in that game yesterday, I’m sure Stroman might have pitched Game 6 and I’d be ready for Game 7. I didn’t see it to be a big deal.\n“Texas might have been a little bit weird, but we’ve definitely moved past that.”\nIt was a little weird, right? With a six-run lead? And left unsaid, a five-run lead in Game 5 against the Royals, even if Price apparently volunteered for bullpen duty, if necessary? Maybe that admission alone indicates something slumbering beneath the surface.\nBut that doesn’t matter. Or it shouldn’t, not now. Maybe Price is secretly upset, and that would be OK. But he spent all of Game 5 in the bullpen, and was aware of the plan, just as he was in Texas. In Texas, Price probably would have started Game 4, if he could have.\nThat doesn’t matter, either. Yes, Gibbons has managed like a man with a fear of heights on a balcony — it’s not that he will fall, it’s that it’s conceivable that a fall could occur, so you may as well close the best door you can. Yes, Price has often been that door, in situations weird and otherwise.\nWell, now it’s up to David Price to be David freakin’ Price. Forget how he’s been used: He talked about having to be great even when you’re not at your best, which may be a hint, but also says it shouldn’t affect him, so, OK. Forget his past: He says he tried to put positive thoughts in his head when that seventh-inning popup dropped in Game 2, to keep the negative thoughts from creeping in. Price will be a much richer man by year’s end, here or more likely elsewhere, but he knows that his reputation will rise or fall further Friday night. And more importantly, Toronto’s season could end.\n“Sure. I guess this is the time that counts,” Price said. “What I did in the regular season doesn’t matter. I get it. But I know I’m a good pitcher. I know I’m a very good pitcher. Good things are going to happen. Everybody is going to say whatever they want to say and write what they want to write. And I completely get that, but I know good things are going to happen.\n“Yeah, I haven’t got a win as a starter in the playoffs. I guess I have to prove that I can pitch at this point in the season in the playoffs. I get that. But I don’t have to go out there and prove that I’m a good pitcher. I think I’ve done that over the seven years of my career.”\nPerfectly delivered, on the outside corner. On Friday night, David Price will pitch the biggest game of his life, on what could be a cold and rainy night in Kansas City. His team will need it. He will need it. And if he’s truly great, then all the stuff that came before won’t matter at all.\nMore on thestar.com\nBlue Jays out to prove there’s more dimension to their offence\nBernier’s first stop should be to end goalie debate: Feschuk", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:15:51.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
