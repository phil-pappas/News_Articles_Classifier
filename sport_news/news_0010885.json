The deadly unrest that has raged for more than two weeks prompted a “very concerned” US President Barack Obama to call for calm as the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting yesterday. The mounting death toll has prompted fears of a new Palestinian intifada, or uprising, like those of 1987-93 and 2000-2005, when thousands were killed in near-daily violence. Two of the attacks today happened in the flashpoint West Bank city of Hebron where some 500 Jewish settlers live in a heavily guarded enclave in the city centre surrounded by nearly 200,000 Palestinians. The third happened at a checkpoint in a Jewish settlement neighbourhood of Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem. US President Barack Obama has expressed his concern over the recent spate of violence in Jerusalem, with Secretary of State John Kerry calling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to calm down the situation. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:22:51.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
