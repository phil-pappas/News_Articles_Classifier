Another Oklahoma season filled with promise has been redirected in early October when least expected. Tyrone Swoopes threw a touchdown pass and ran for another score to lead Texas to a 24-17 victory against No. 10 Oklahoma on Saturday. The Sooners got behind 14-0 in the first quarter and never recovered. \"It didn't get away,\" Oklahoma coach Bob Stoops said. \"I mean 14 points isn't away. It surely didn't start off great, but in the end I do feel like we were ready.\" Coach Charlie Strong's Longhorns (2-4, 1-2 Big 12) came to Dallas in the midst of the program's worst start in 59 years and as a 17-point underdog to the Sooners (4-1, 1-1). It's been nothing but turmoil and excruciating losses for the Longhorns so far, but Strong's defense sacked Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield six times and his offense ran for 313 yards. \"They had been in some tight, tough games, and we knew what they were capable of,\" Stoops said. Jerrod Heard mostly guided the Texas offense with 168 total yards, 115 rushing, and Swoopes played finisher near the goal line. His 2-yard TD flip to Caleb Bluiett with 13:52 left in the fourth quarter made it 24-10. Oklahoma responded with a long scoring drive capped by Samaje Perine's 1-yard touchdown run to cut it to 24-17 with 8:00 minutes left. Oklahoma got the ball back with 6:05 left, but two sacks, the last by Naashon Hughes and Poona Ford, forced OU to punt. The Longhorns churned out three first downs to kill the clock and take the 110th meeting between the Red River rivals. \"We needed this,\" Strong said. Texas is now 6-2 since 1989 in Red River games in which it was unranked and the Sooners were ranked. Mayfield was 20 for 28 for 211 yards and a touchdown pass, but Perine was held to 36 yards on 10 carries. \"It was nothing unusual in their game plan,\" Mayfield said. \"It was just they were doing basic things that they needed to do, and we weren't doing that early on today.\" The Longhorns fans were slow filling their half of the Cotton Bowl as kickoff approached. There was also a little more room to spread out on that side of the stadium, with a smattering of empty seats. Confidence was not high among Longhorns but Sooners were wary. Before the game an OU fan waiting for an elevator with a group of Texas fans said: \"This reminds me too much of two years ago.\" In that game, Texas came in 3-2 with coach Mack Brown's future very much in doubt and won 36-20. The win provided a temporary boost in a tense season for Texas that ultimately ended with Brown stepping down under pressure. Page 2 of 2 - Year 2 under Strong has gotten off to an even worse start for the Longhorns than year 16 under Brown, but that worried Sooners fan seemed prescient when Texas jumped out to an early lead behind a fired up defense. Texas swarmed Mayfield on a third-and-long and Strong was 10 yards on to the playing field to greet his defense with hand slaps and pats on the back. It was the first of four sacks in the first half for Texas. \"They were the more physical team today,\" Oklahoma offensive lineman Ty Darlington said. The Longhorns offense fed off that energy, too. They took the lead on a 24-yard shovel pass sweep from Heard to Marcus Johnson. Oklahoma fumbled away the ensuing kickoff and Texas turned the short field into a 3-yard touchdown plunge by Swoopes. The Sooners came to life in the third quarter. Mayfield threw a low strike in the end zone to Dimitri Flowers from 3 yards out to cut Texas' lead to 17-10 with 5:16 left in the third. Texas responded when D'Onta Foreman broke free of a tackle at the line and raced 81 yards on the last play of the third quarter. The 11th-longest run in Texas history set up the Longhorns at the Oklahoma 10 and the UT fans spent the commercial break volleying \"Texas!\" ''Fight!\" across the Cotton Bowl. Soon after, Swoopes flipped a jump pass to a wide-open Bluiett in the end zone to make it 24-10 with 13:52 left. Strong and the Longhorns left the Cotton Bowl feeling better and thinking that they could salvage the season. Stoops and the Sooners head back to Norman with another loss in a game they were favored to win, looking nothing like a team that can keep Baylor and TCU from deciding the Big 12 again.
