Most callers were simply curious since there was no inclement weather.\nAmong those who heard them was Mayor Bill Wescott, who said he and his wife watched the end of the game and heard the blare a few minutes later as they were pulling out of their driveway to go visit his mother.\nA short time later, the Fire Department called to let him know what had happened, and it was not to celebrate the Cubs' victory.\nCity officials say a firefighter was working on a report in the station's control room when he reached for a piece of tape from a dispenser on a shelf. However, instead of cleanly tearing off a piece of tape, he pulled the dispenser off the shelf and onto a control panel. It hit the button that activated the sirens and the pagers for volunteer firefighters.\n\"I wish I could make up a better story than that,\" Wescott said Friday.\nFor some Chicago baseball fans, reports of the incident might bring back memories of 1959, when Chicago's fire commissioner ordered air-raid sirens sounded to salute an American League pennant-clinching victory by the White Sox, not realizing how it would unnerve thousands of city residents afflicted by Cold War jitters.\nYoung Cubs make history at old Wrigley Field in advancing to NLCS Mark Gonzales From young power hitters Javier Baez and Kyle Schwarber to a deep supporting cast of relievers, the Cubs demonstrated Tuesday night there may be more hits to come.\n\"I tell (musician) Eddie Vedder that this is like our first record,\" President Theo Epstein said. \"You put that record out and things...\nFrom young power hitters Javier Baez and Kyle Schwarber to a deep supporting cast of relievers, the Cubs demonstrated Tuesday night there may be more hits to come.\n\"I tell (musician) Eddie Vedder that this is like our first record,\" President Theo Epstein said. \"You put that record out and things...\n(Mark Gonzales) Rock Falls Fire Chief Gary Cook said the firefighter responsible for Tuesday's incident happens to be a Cubs fan and has come in for a lot of ribbing from fellow first responders.\n\"He's been getting hammered,\" Cook said.\nCook and Wescott said they've heard from residents who think the Fire Department was caught up in Cub mania, but they said it is what it is.\n\"There are some people that insist it wasn't an accident. But there's no way we would do that,\" Cook said.\nSince Tuesday, the story has taken on a life of its own, the chief said. However, the mayor said, there will not be a repeat performance, even if the Cubs make baseball history.\n\"If the Cubs win the World Series, I could see a lot of horns going off — but not the tornado warning system,\" Wescott said.\nClifford Ward is a freelance reporter.\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Chicago Cubs St. Louis Cardinals National League American League Chicago White Sox", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56216a4d/turbine/ct-cubs-win-rock-falls-sirens-met-1017-20151016", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561dca29/turbine/ct-cubs-win-nlds-report-cardinals-spt-1014-20151013"], "published": "2015-10-17T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:07:04.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
