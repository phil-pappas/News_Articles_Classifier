Brandon hosts Swift Current tonight. (COLIN CORNEAU/BRANDON SUN) \nThe Brandon Wheat Kings will take to the ice tonight at Westman Place looking to avenge a shootout loss they suffered to the Swift Current Broncos in their home opener last month. \nThe Wheat Kings fired 54 shots at Broncos netminder Landon Bow on Sept. 25 to open their Western Hockey League season, but only scored once in 65 minutes of regulation and overtime play. They were then blanked in the shootout by the 20-year-old goalie as the Broncos scored the only goal and won 2-1. \nHead coach and general manager Kelly McCrimmon said it’s a game his team would like to build on as they head out on the road for their annual West Coast trip. \n\"It’s our last home game in three weeks,\" McCrimmon said. \"They beat us in our building the last time we played. There’s nothing more that has to be said in terms of the importance to our team. It’s a big game and one that we’ll be ready for.\" \nAfter playing in Saskatoon on Saturday against the Blades, the Wheat Kings visit all five U.S. division teams between Oct. 21 and 28. \nBrandon then plays in Kootenay on Oct. 30 and in Moose Jaw on Nov. 1 before its next home game, on Nov. 6 when the Victoria Royals visit Westman Place. \nOverage defenceman Colton Waltz said it’s never an easy game when they play Swift Current. \n\"We’ve had some good battles over the years,\" Waltz said. \"They’re not going to come in here and roll over for us. They’re going to fight for every inch of the ice out there. We’ll be ready for it and willing to do the same.\" \nBoth teams have won 17 games in the last five years, although Brandon dominated the series last season, winning six of the eight matchups and earning 13 of a possible 16 points. \nOverage forward Rihards Bukarts said a good week of practice will help. \n\"There are no easy teams in this league,\" Bukarts said. \"Every single night we have to go out and work really hard. That’s what we’re going to do. We’ve had a great week of practice, four days, and the boys have worked really hard. I think we’re prepared for a hard hockey game.\" \nThe Broncos have made a significant change since they played the Wheat Kings, adding Jon Martin, a six-foot-two, 218-pound right-winger from Winnipeg who has scored seven goals in four games since joining Swift Current. \nHe was picked up from the Kootenay Ice on Oct. 4 for a fourth-round WHL bantam draft pick in 2016. \nDefenceman Macoy Erkamps, who was named Brandon’s captain on Thursday, said the Wheat Kings will have to be prepared. \n\"We’re going to have to be ready to play, more ready than we were for Edmonton,\" Erkamps said, referencing the team’s 4-3 shootout loss to the Oil Kings last Saturday. \"They’re going to give us their best game and we have to be ready.\" \n» pbergson@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:04:07.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
