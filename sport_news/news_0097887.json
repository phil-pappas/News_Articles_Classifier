Spero on Tuesday granted a motion asking the court to certify a proposed Minor League Collective under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Members include all minor league baseball players who worked for the MLB or any MLB franchise since Feb. 7, 2011, but had not spent time in the major leagues at the time. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:27:05.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
