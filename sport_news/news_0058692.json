That is the problem why he is injured.” \nKlopp says he will “find a way” to convey his grievances to the FA, adding: “These young players are our future. If we handle them like horses we get horses.” \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:16:11.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
