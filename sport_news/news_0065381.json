Staff photo by Kathryn Ingall slideshow WOODSTOCK — Kennesaw Mountain rode the momentum from its walk-off win Wednesday to jump out to an early lead and beat Woodstock 7-0 and clinch a spot in Columbus for the Class elite eight.“I think momentum had a lot to do with it,” Kennesaw Mountain coach Lisa Chapman said. “We talked about needing to get some runs early and getting hits with two outs, and I think we did both of those things well.”Despite coming out of the Region 4 tournament as a No. 3 seed, Kennesaw Mountain (21-14) clinched a spot in Columbus for the fourth time in five years.The Lady Mustangs struggled offensively in Wednesday’s first two games of the series and were shut out for the first 13 innings, but they had no such problem Thursday.After Mallory Parker and Kelli McGrail each reached on an error to start the game, Haley Glass, the hero of Kennesaw Mountain’s season-saving Game 2 win, drove them both in with a single. Parker got back on base the next inning, this time getting driven in on McGrail’s home run, which put Kennesaw Mountain up 4-0.The top of the Lady Mustangs’ order excelled all night. The top four hitters — Parker, McGrail, Hannah Forehand and Glass — combined to reach base 11 times, drive in six runs and score seven.Even without the offensive explosion, Kennesaw Mountain would have been difficult to beat thanks to the play of pitcher Amber Johns.Johns only gave up four hits, and while she only struck out three, her control was on point. Region 5 champion Woodstock (25-7) failed to hit any ball squarely and hit fly balls out for 13 of their 21 outs.“I have a ton of confidence in this team,” Chapman said. “To fight through all the injuries we’ve had this year says a lot about this team. It seems like we’re starting to hit some more, and I can’t say enough about Amber Johns. We got to this point on her shoulders, and now we’re going to Columbus on her shoulders. I’m really excited about what this team can do.”Woodstock’s defensive struggles, combined with its game-long struggles from the plate, were too much to overcome, but coach Kortney Dempsey said it did not take away from the season as a whole.“We came up a little bit short, but I’m really proud of this team,” she said. “We never gave up, and we fought until the very end. What I’ll remember about this team is that they were very hard-working and very coachable. They were serious, but also very fun. If we can get a group who listens like these girls and has fun like these girls every year, we’re going to do some big things.”Alisha House had two of Woodstock’s four hits with a double in the first inning and a single in the fourth. Laura Bishop and Maddie Reid each added a single during a comeback attempt in the seventh, but it was all Woodstock could muster.After dominating the first two games, Bishop was in the circle again, but her eight strikeouts were not enough.The good news for Woodstock is that it will only be losing three seniors to graduation, leaving the rest of the team to return with more experience.“Games like this do a lot for our younger players,” Dempsey said. “I know we were already down, but Laura pitching in that last inning with the bases loaded, and us hitting with our backs against the wall, are experiences we can’t duplicate in practice, so it was good to get that at least. For the girls who will be back, now they know how it feels to get here, so, hopefully, they’ll be ready to take it even further next year.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:53:06.148+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
