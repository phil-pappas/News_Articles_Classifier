He, not fellow defenseman Shea Theodore, will join the Ducks on their five-game trip that begins Thursday in Nashville.\nCoach Bruce Boudreau had the choice to play either defenseman before the Ducks’ first victory Sunday. He chose Holzer for the first time since he arrived via a March 2 trade with Toronto.\n“He was fine,” Boudreau said of Holzer’s performance. “You’ve got to believe that a young man is a little nervous when he hasn’t played an NHL game for the team yet and he got here in March.\n“But in the third period, I thought he showed his true worth, hitting with his stick, clearing guys out. He’s a big, strong man. We can always use that.”\nBoudreau is somewhat excited to see Holzer on the ice.\n“If you’ve got any feelings, I mean, we’re not robots out there,” Boudreau said. “I mean, I would have loved to have seen him play (last season). He came in with the best attitude. Every day, just worked hard. You want to reward guys like that. So, I was very happy that he was able to play and be a contributor.”\nAnd Theodore? The Ducks sent him back to the AHL affiliate San Diego on Monday.\n“Young guys need to play, and when they’re confident and they feel better, that’s when they get the call,” Boudreau said. “You don’t want to thrust somebody into something he’s not ready for, because then it only goes downhill.\n“Shea’s gotten better every year I’ve seen him, better in training camp, and he’s starting to fill into his body. I think there’s going to be a time when he’s going to be playing for this team.”\nSTONER CLOSE TO PLAYING \nClayton Stoner, who missed the Ducks’ victory against the Wild, is expected to be back on the ice during the Ducks’ trip. Boudreau said the defender could be ready to go Thursday, but he won’t be eligible to return to game action until Oct. 26 at Chicago because he is on injured reserve.\nStoner was placed on injured reserve Oct. 17 because of a lower body injury, but he said Tuesday that he will be ready when activated.\n“I haven’t missed that much,” he said. “It might seem like I’ve missed a lot but it’s been only three days; the team has been off a couple of days. I’ve missed a couple of practices and been on the ice past few days, so I feel fine.”\nFellow defenseman Simon Despres, who also is on injured reserve, still isn’t “feeling quite right” according to Boudreau and remains sidelined. He was knocked in the head in Friday’s game by Colorado’s Tyson Barrie, who got a three-game suspension for the illegal hit.\nRyan Kesler took a maintenance day Tuesday and did not practice.\nRELEASE VALVE \nThe Ducks’ first victory in their first five games not only lifted the players’ spirits, but eased the pressure that had been building in the locker room.\n“When things aren’t going right and you feel like you’re doing the right things, you tend to tense up a little bit, maybe second-guess yourselves,” Kevin Bieksa said. “I think we all knew in the back of our minds that it was a matter of time. When that goestwo, three, four, five games, that eats at you. So this was a sense of relief.”\nThat sense of relief even extended to the coach’s office.\n“Nobody likes to lose,” Boudreau said. “Even though it’s early, we heard it (negative comments) after Day 1 (asking) what’s wrong with the Ducks? The Ducks lost the first game.\n“It’s a long year and you’re going to through peaks and you’re going to go through valleys. I don’t think we were as bad as people thought we were and I don’t think we are as good as people thought we could be at that point, early on in the season. Our goal is to get better every game, so let’s get better every game.”\nNOTE \nThe Ducks assigned forward Chris Wagner to the San Diego Gulls on Tuesday. He appeared in one game, going scoreless on one shot against Colorado.\nContact the writer: jcarr@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:53:56.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
