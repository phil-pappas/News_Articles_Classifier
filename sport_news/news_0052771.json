(AP Photo/Daniel Ochoa de Olza) Comments \nAnother game overseas, another powerful display of team basketball from the Boston Celtics. \nThe Celtics finished their two-game trip to Europe with a 111-96 victory against Real Madrid, which should be one of the better clubs in Spain. According to ESPN projections , Real would be expected to win about 30 games if it played in the NBA. Still, Boston had no real issues, looking a class above even when going deep into the bench. \nWhen the game turned: After a close first quarter, Boston ramped up the defense and ball movement to seize control in the second. The opposition featured a load of former NBA players, including Sergio Rodriguez, Gustavo Ayon and Andres Nocioni. That's a talented group, but Boston gathered five steals, threw assists on seven out of 10 buckets, and slowly pulled away. By halftime, the Celtics led 54-42. \nCeltics standouts: \n-- We won't waste much time discussing Isaiah Thomas because he's Isaiah Thomas and he's going to do Isaiah Thomas things regularly. The lefty didn't have his most efficient game (6-for-15 shooting, only three free throw attempts), but still managed 15 points, four rebounds and three assists over 25 minutes. \n--- David Lee, again. Over the first five minutes, the big man threw a pretty backdoor assist to Avery Bradley; made a righty hook; dribbled around his back while trying to go coast-to-coast (his runner missed, but the pressure on the defense freed Tyler Zeller for a putback); pirouetted into a layup after a tough catch; sparked an Avery Bradley corner three by grabbing a defensive rebound, taking a couple of hard dribbles and whipping an outlet pass to Jae Crowder; and committed a turnover (darn) while trying to throw another assist. Lee (13 points, 11 rebounds, four assists over 21 minutes) has the green light to handle the ball and make plays, and he looks like he should boost the Celtics offense, though he has flaws at the other end of the court. \n--- Avery Bradley (game-high 17 points) made his first two 3-pointers to run his mark from that range to 6-for-6 this preseason, all from the corners. The guard also read the passing lanes for a couple of steals, ran the court for a pair of layups, and revealed a sidestep three he should use more often: \nThe coaching staff has begged Bradley to shoot fewer long twos; the sidestep would be an easy way to move some more of his attempts behind the arc. Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson use that tool a lot in Golden State, and while Bradley is not either of those guys, erasing a couple midrange jumpers per game would help to continue his development. Last season, he probably would have taken a one-dribble pull-up from about 20 feet. \n--- Despite managing no shot attempts in the first half, Jae Crowder did his part to facilitate good offense with five assists before the break. He picked up the scoring a bit after halftime (eight points in the third), but made a greater impact with defense and playmaking -- which works too. The Celtics have a load of willing passers and should spread the scoring around. \n--- Over two preseason games, Kelly Olynyk has weirdly delivered his team's two best crossovers. He brought out the impressive handles again Thursday: \nIt's not exactly Tim Hardaway, but how many 7-footers can do that? Olynyk could still use a more aggressive mindset, but at least he helped make the pregame routine a happy place: \nRookie watch: \n--- No. 28 pick R.J. Hunter was the only rookie to see action in the first half, and he (again) looked comfortable. The guard missed both of his second-quarter shots (and finished 1-for-6 for two points) but showed a knack for reacting quickly to his defender, reading the court, and delivering the right pass. One pocket pass to Tyler Zeller led the center to an easy layup. ... \n--- During the fourth quarter, the rookies all played together and held their own against some experienced opponents. Terry Rozier stood out with 12 points, three assists and two steals in the period. He drained a pair of threes, had some success running pick-and-rolls and also looked good in transition. Jordan Mickey added two dunks en route to five points. \nPlay of the game:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:07:43.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
