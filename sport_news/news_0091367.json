Snyder says ESPN report is 'false'", "locations": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "Quin Snyder was quick to shoot down an ESPN report this week that forward Elijah Millsap had \"lost the trust\" of the Utah Jazz coaching staff and was a \"long shot\" to make the team's roster.\n\"That's totally false,\" the head coach said when asked Thursday. \"Elijah's played really well. I talked to Elijah like once a week all summer. [Assistant coach] Brad Jones flew out to see him. â€¦ I don't even know what to say.\"\nMillsap, 28, does not have a fully guaranteed contract, which could certainly create questions about his future in Utah. But the tenacious wing defender has impressed coaches with his effort last season and the strides he's shown early in camp.\n  \"The thing he's been doing is making better decisions with the ball, when to pass, when to shoot on his drives,\" Snyder said. \"He's played well.\"\nLast season, Millsap played in 47 games for the Jazz after being called up from the D-League. He averaged 5.3 points and more than a steal a game. But too often (1.4 turnovers per game, for instance) Millsap struggled with decision making and ball control.\nSnyder admitted he's been hard on Millsap, the younger brother of former Jazz player Paul Millsap, to improve his decision making.\n\"If he can be efficient like that on offense, that's when his defense becomes even more valuable,\" Snyder said.\n\nAloha means goodbye \nThe Jazz left Salt Lake City on Friday for Hawaii, where they'll play two preseason games against the Los Angeles Lakers. According to the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, both games have already sold out.\nThe trip, atypical for a Jazz preseason, should also create opportunities for some team building, Snyder said.\n\"I'm not saying Gordon [Hayward] and Fav (Derrick Favors) have to go for a long swim together to bond,\" Snyder quipped. \"But I would like to see Alec [Burks] hula.\"\n\nInjury report\nJazz forward Chris Johnson was hit in the head by an elbow during Wednesday's evening practice, team officials said. Johnson was held out of practice Thursday as he began the NBA's concussion protocol.\n\nafalk@sltrib.com \nTwitter: @tribjazz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T10:29:46.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
