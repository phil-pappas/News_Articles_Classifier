Garnering wins like they were flowers in an open field, he tallied 100 total victories in a record setting pace to put his name in the same category as Steve Spurrier. \nJust shy of 16 seasons with the Tigers, victory 150 came along. Georgetown has become a program synonymous with winning even in its lean years. \nSaturday, in a 40-7 rout over visiting Union College, Cronin's crew added another impressive stat to the list. In just 115 home games, Georgetown has won 100 – an 87 winning percentage. \nThe humble coach from Indiana is quick to point to all those around him who have made this possible – administration, the players and his amazing staff. \n\"I thank the administration for everything,\" Cronin said. \"But it's a sign that we've had some great coaches here. I've had several coaches who were great teachers and mentors to our kids. And the players that we've drawn here have been great. It's a sign of a lot of pride and tradition and hopefully we can keep it going for several more years.\"Alongside him for all 100 wins – coach Bruce Owens, who has been chief recruiting coordinator, assistant head coach and defensive line coach. He has helped the Tigers to bring in some of the best talent from all across the south as well as shore up one of the strongest components throughout all the success. \nAssistant Marty Park has also been at Georgetown in some form or fashion for all 100 wins. He started as a player under Cronin and immediately joined the staff following graduation. Defensive coordinator Shan Housekeeper played for Cronin and has been back with the Tigers for a lot of those victories. \nThe list goes on from current staff members to all the ones that have come and gone. \nHowever, as most of the tributes from around the country that played after the win noted, it takes a special leader to make all of these parts work together so well and for so long. \n\"You can have all the most talented coaches in the world, but if you don't bring them together it just doesn't work,\" said GC Director of Athletics Brian Evans. \"We have an amazing staff of brilliant coaches. \nCronin understands how to get the best out of everyone. That unit is a family. Even when members of his staff move on to new coaching opportunities they are still tied in and connected to what is happening here. It is a love and a passion that flows all the way from the top.\"Tiger Pride is a powerful thing and will continue to be the life source for many milestones that are surely to come in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:52:50.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
