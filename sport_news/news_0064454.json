Roland (Morris) continued a streak of good play and could have even been quite a bit lower.\" \nMorris led the Blue Storm (7-0) for the third straight match by shooing an 80. Right behind him was Ross Brown, who fired an 82, and Ruichi Zhou carded an 85. \nSolid scoring continued as Joseph Bucci posted an 86, and Mike DeNunzio finished with an 87.
