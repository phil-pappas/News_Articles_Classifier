(Bryn Lennon / Getty Images) Dave Hyde Contact Reporter Sun Sentinel Columnist South Florida fans enjoyed their trip to London, up until the point the Dolphins game started. \nWhile the Colletti family of Coral Springs and the Natale and Coutoupis families of New Jersey saw historical sights and enjoyed fine dining in one of the world's premier cities this weekend, one aspect of their trip stood out. \n\"The trash talking,\" Matt Coutoupis, 14, said. \nThe Collettis are Miami Dolphins fans. The Natales and Coutoupises are New York Jets fans. They made a rivalry of their family reunion complete with team jerseys, well-placed barbs and, ultimately, the Jets contingent flying home happy after their team's 27-14 win over the Dolphins on Sunday at Wembley Stadium. \n\"What better way to get everyone together?\" Lisa Colletti said in her Dolphins cap and shirt before Sunday's game. \"We reunited as a family and fought as a family.\" \nFor Dolphins fans everywhere, the question after another ugly loss was, \"How much of this can you take?\" But for the fans from South Florida who actually made the journey to England, the question was, \"How far do you want to go to take it?\" \nCheck all the images from the Miami Dolphins' second year in a row visiting London. \n\"What a buzzkill that game was,'' said Jennifer Smyth, a mental health counselor from Jupiter. \"There was no passion by the Dolphins at the start, none at all. It was such a great atmosphere — and then that [result]. \n\"Regardless of where we are, it's the Jets. It's still a big game for us. It stinks to lose to them even on a great trip.\" \nSmyth, a Dolphins season-ticket holder for 15 years, came to a Dolphins game in London with two good friends for her second straight year. Last year's game overseas, a 38-14 win over the Oakland Raiders, at least had a more pleasant result. \n\"The atmosphere here was amazing again for the game,\" she said. \"The fans were great. Everybody was excited. And then it was just ... well, the Dolphins didn't contribute to the atmosphere.\" \nThere was fun in the big city. Joe Corsetti, 46, of Lighthouse Point came with three Dolphins fans from Broward County who met up with 14 Dolphins fans who live in London. What surprised him was the reach and pull the team still has across Europe. \n\"The great part was walking around town and seeing Dolphins fans everywhere,\" Corsetti said. \"We'd go into a pub and there'd be Dolphins fans from Italy and Spain who were here because this is the closest game for them. \n\"Just talking with those fans, sharing some of the same experiences with the team, that was pretty cool to do.\" \nAnd the game? \n\"We come all the way over there, it looked like most of the crowd was [rooting] for [the Dolphins] and they laid an egg,\" Crossetti said. \"I hate to say it but [coach Joe] Philbin has to go.\" \nAs a \"home\" game for the Dolphins, Wembley Stadium — which had an announced crowd of 83,986 for the game — carried many of the staples of Sun Life Stadium. The Dolphins' fight song played. Dolphins features played on the video board. First downs were met by the announcer's call of, \"Fiiirst down!\" \nIra Birns is the story of one side of South Florida as a transplanted New Yorker who lives in Brickell and roots for the Jets. He went to London with his son, Ben, who just graduated from the University of Miami. \n\"It a phenomenal experience to see the Jets play in London,\" Birns said. \"I think NFL London is doing great things. This whole \"International Series\" is great marketing for the game, great for local fans and great for people like us to make a good trip.\" \nBirns did have one minor irritant. \n\"The J-E-T-S cheer wasn't as loud as I would've hoped,\" he said. \nLate in the game, the Dolphins fans made a unified cheer, too. \"Fire Philbin\" wasn't what the Dolphins were hoping to hear in the fourth quarter, but there it was. \nThe only consolation for some Dolphins fans was that London offered a way to soften the loss. \n\"There's a pub on every corner,\" Smyth said. Two hours after the game, she was nursing her disappointment over a white wine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T23:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T01:20:42.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
