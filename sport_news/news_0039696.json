As a result, Okafor won't be ready to go full-bore at the start of the season. \n\"But he has no right to come out and be fit right from this injury,\" Brown said. \"So I've got to be smart with the minutes I give him.\" \nThe goal is to eventually play him for four eight-minute stretches in a game to get up to 32 minutes. \nBrown said Okafor came into training camp in \"good shape.\" \n\"He's been tremendously set back now\" with the sore knee, Brown said. \"He was going to be fine, going through [training camp at] Stockton [University].\" \nAt 268 pounds, Okafor has lost seven pounds since he played in the Utah Jazz and NBA summer leagues in July. Brown declined to reveal the targeted playing weight for the third overall draft pick out of Duke. \n\"There are a few goals that we have,\" the coach said. \"But like a little bit with Joel [Embiid], we will probably keep them in house. Fair question, but keep them in house\". Shorthanded \nThe Sixers had only 10 available players by the end of Wednesday's practice. \nShooting guard JaKarr Sampson had right knee soreness and did not finish practice as a precautionary measure. Power forward Nerlens Noel (lower back and left knee bruise) and reserve point guard Pierre Jackson (groin) were scheduled for limited practices. \n\"In general, we have a bunch of wounded players right now,\" Brown said. Honor for Toney \nFormer Sixers standout guard Andrew Toney will be honored by the Georgia Senate on Thursday for his community involvement in Gwinnett County, a suburb of Atlanta. He is a lead program facilitator in the Gwinnett County Public Schools academic support department. \nFor the last six years, Tony has played a major role in the department's community mentoring program, which pairs the district's African American middle and high school boys with male mentors. \nHe played for the Sixers from 1980 to 1988, helping them win the title in 1983. The two-time NBA all-star's career was cut short by stress fractures in his feet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:21:22.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
