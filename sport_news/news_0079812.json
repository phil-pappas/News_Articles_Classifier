Neither County Manager Tomas Campos or Deputy County Manager David Trujillo could be reached for comment on Carlos Trujillo’s employment status o rhiringCarlos Trujillo first pled no contest to DWI in 2010.\nA deputy arrived at a residence on Cowboy Lane in the Arroyo Seco area of northern Santa Fe County in response to a report of a reckless driver. The deputy located and approached Trujillo, 33, who was still in the driver’s seat with the engine running. Trujillo told the deputy he was waiting for a ride because he didn’t have a driver’s license and said he didn’t know who lived at the residence. The deputy noted that Trujillo was having trouble speaking and had fresh injection marks on his arms. Trujillo admitted to injecting heroin earlier that day and taking Xanax, typically used to treat panic and anxiety disorders.\nMedics were called to the scene after field sobriety tests were conducted because Trujillo was drifting in and out of consciousness and they transported him to the Christus St. Vincent Regional Medical Center in Santa Fe for low oxygen levels. His 2008 Mercedes was seized in accordance with county ordinance.\nTrujillo also had a driving with a revoked license charge dropped without prejudice in Santa Fe County Magistrate Court in 2013.
