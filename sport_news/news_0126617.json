That ushered in a new Lakers that would lead to back-to-back NBA championships in 2009 and 2010.\nPage Six has confirmed the 35-year-old basketball player was at Dennis Hof’s Love Ranch South in Pahrump, Nevada, when he was found unconscious Tuesday afternoon. Odom — the ex-husband of Khloé Kardashian — had been at the ranch alone since Saturday and reportedly was taking an herbal substitute for Viagra.\nLamar Odom and Khloe Kardashian in 2011.

Metta World Peace, a teammate with Odom on the Lakers championship teams, found it difficult to muster many words when speaking with reporters.\n“There’s nothing I can say. I don’t even know what to say,” said World Peace, who grew up with Odom in the New York City area before playing with him in purple and gold from 2009 to 2011. “There’s not one word I can say right now that would make sense.”\nThe Lakers franchise had yet to officially comment on Odom as of early Wednesday, but coach Byron Scott told reporters after Tuesday’s game, “Our heart and thoughts and prayers are with Lamar and his family and I wish him all the best. That’s obviously something you don’t want to hear before the game.”\nThe Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, where Lamar Odom is being treated.

It’s sad. I don’t know how anybody can deal with that.”\n  This article originally appeared on Fox Sports .\nFiled under kobe bryant ,  lamar odom ,  los angeles lakers ,  metta world peace ,  nick young", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T12:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:05:12.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
