Tamme (concussion) was hurt in last week's victory at Dallas and has yet to be cleared. \nThe Falcons (3-0) will also be without return specialist Devin Hester, who has yet to play this season because of turf toe. \nLinebacker Brooks Reed is expected to get his first action of the season after recovering from groin surgery. Star receiver Julio Jones (toe and hamstring) and running back Devonta Freeman (toe) are also probable after fully participating in Friday's practice. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T02:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T03:30:18.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
