Here's a breakdown of two matchups that have the potential to fatten your wallet on Sunday. \nGiants vs. Niners Betting Pick \nThe early-season struggles of the San Francisco 49ers means that the New York Giants giving seven points at home for Sunday night sounds like it's in the right ballpark for this primetime matchup. \nNiners quarterback Colin Kaepernick has been awful in the last two weeks, failing to record a touchdown pass and tossing five interceptions while amassing just 227 yards during that span and leading many to believe his job could be on the line if these poor performances continue. \nMeanwhile, New York is coming off a convincing 24-10 road victory over the Buffalo Bills and has covered the spread in three of its first four games to open the season. With the NFC East division title seemingly up for grabs this year, the Giants will be more motivated than ever to make some headway by capitalizing on the Niners' issues and winning big in this one. \nRaiders vs. Broncos Betting Pick \nThe combination of the Broncos' poor offense and top-notch defense through four weeks has kept their games low-scoring and close. Through their first four games the Broncos are a perfect 4-0 straight-up but they have won by an average of just seven points per game. \nBut Denver has yet to face an offense as multi-faceted as the one owned by the Raiders this season, with Oakland's combination of Derek Carr , Latavius Murray and Amari Cooper providing the team with an offensive threat that the Black Hole has not had in years. \nThe Raiders are listed as 5-point home underdogs at the sportsbooks against the Broncos for their matchup late on Sunday afternoon, but watch for Oakland to at least keep the final score close enough to pull out the cover against their division rival.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:02:51.202+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
