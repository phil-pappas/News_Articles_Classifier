It's been nothing but turmoil and excruciating losses for the Longhorns so far, but Strong's defense harassed Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield and the offense made just enough plays to show Texas fans that better times might not be so far away. \nJerrod Heard mostly guided the Texas offense with 168 total yards and Swoopes played finisher near the goal line. His 2-yard TD flip to Caleb Bluiett with 13:52 left in the fourth quarter made it 24-10. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
