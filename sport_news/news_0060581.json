Police and army would have to guard it permanently to prevent illegal crossings,\" Cerar said.\nMore than 47,500 people have entered Slovenia, which has a population of just two million, since October 17 when Budapest shut its frontier with Croatia, barely a month after also closing its Serbian border.\nMost of the migrants, mainly fleeing violence in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, want to get to Germany, the EU's economic powerhouse.\nSome 14,000 were waiting in Slovenian refugee camps and registration centres on Friday morning, hoping to continue to neighbouring Austria whose Spielfeld border camp was also bursting with new arrivals.\nAustrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz on Friday warned the \"surge into Europe\" had become too big, adding that bloc members had a responsibility to protect their borders.\nBorder fences in Hungary and other EU countries had proven effective in tackling the crisis, Kurz said.\n\"The question is whether you want them or not,\" he told public broadcaster Oe1.\nHis comments echo those of Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner who on Thursday announced it was time for the EU to \"build fortress Europe\", after she had visited the Spielfeld checkpoint.\nAround 7,000 migrants have crossed into Austria from Slovenia since Thursday, with some 4,500 still stranded at Spielfeld on Friday morning, police said.\nFurther down the migrant trail, 5,000 more people spent the night in freezing temperatures at Serbia's Berkasovo border crossing with Croatia, UN refugee agency spokeswoman Celine Schmitt told AFP on Friday.\nPeople lit fires to warm themselves in the chilly morning fog, an AFP reporter said, while others looked for blankets, which appeared to be running short among voluntary aid workers. Children were crying inside small tents.\n\"So many children, (this is a) catastrophe,\" a Serbian police officer said.\nCroatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic and his Serbian counterpart Nebojsa Stefanovic were to meet at the nearby main Batrovci border crossing later on Friday to discuss the situation at Berkasovo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:14:05.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
