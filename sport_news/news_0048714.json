The Senators won 5-4. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang \nChris Neil, Mike Hoffman, Chris Wideman and Cody Ceci also scored for the Senators.\nDale Weise, Alex Galchenyuk, Brendan Gallager and Max Pacioretty supplied the goals for the Canadiens.\nNeither club had their starting goaltenders in net. Dustin Tokarski took the loss for the Canadiens while Matt O'Connor got an unexpected start after being called up from the Binghamton Senators earlier in the week on an injury recall just hours after having been sent down.\nCeci put the Senators ahead 5-3 in the third period before Pacioretty cut that lead to one goal with 40 seconds to play in regulation.\nStone sent Ottawa into the second intermission with a 4-3 lead thanks to a power-play goal at 16:53.\nTrailing 3-1, Galchenyuk scored the Canadiens' second power-play goal of the game at 7:18 of the second period. A little less than four minutes later Gallagher tipped a puck past O'Connor from the side of the net to tie the game.\nOttawa beat Tokarski three times on just eight shots in the first period for a 3-1 lead after 20 minutes of action.\nNeil opened the scoring as his slap shot found a way past Tokarski just 4:43 into the game.\nJust ahead of the midway point of the period Weise tied the game with a power-play goal at 9:17, but just 19 seconds later the Senators reclaimed their one-goal advantage when Hoffman scored.\nAt 17:04 Wideman made the score 3-1 as Turris collected his third assist of the period on the goal.\nBoth teams open the regular season on the road with the Canadiens visiting the Toronto Maple Leafs on Wednesday while the Senators will be in Buffalo on Thursday to face the Sabres.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T05:05:45.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
