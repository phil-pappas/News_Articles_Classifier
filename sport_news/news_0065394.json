The shots that went in, they won’t count in a week, but it felt like they might. It was just the preseason, but maybe, Thursday at Staples Center, there was a moment people might remember.\nThe Clippers came back from 35 points down against the Portland Trail Blazers in their preseason finale, and it was the bench doing most of the heavy lifting.\nThere was Paul Pierce, staging his own, albeit late, Back to the Future day, hitting 3-points shots on three possessions in a row.\nThere was Austin Rivers, hounding opponents and hitting big shots, chest out, oozing confidence.\nThere was Wesley Johnson firing from the corners, hitting shots without hesitation.\nThere was Josh Smith, patrolling the paint and swatting away shots at the rim.\nAnd there were the starters on the bench, just like the fans in the seats, jumping up and down as the reserves finished off the wild comeback.\n“We were playing for real,” Rivers said.\nRivers and other members of the Clippers bench have seen a difference with their group over the past week, a difference that coincides with Johnson moving out of the starting lineup and into the second unit.\nMost players in Johnson’s position – on a one-year minimum deal auditioning for a hefty payday next summer – wouldn’t accept a demotion with grace, much less enthusiasm.\nBut Johnson sees the upside to coming off the bench.\n“We’re starting to build chemistry. In practice when they moved me down there, it was a comfortable fit,” Johnson said Thursday. “Playing with the starters, it was (comfortable) as well, but you were just trying to figure out how they play. They’ve been together awhile. You come in and you try not to do the wrong things when you’re with them, but with (the bench) you come in and it’s free flowing.”\nClippers coach Doc Rivers could see the ease Johnson played with off the bench, calling the forward’s lack of hesitation maybe his “favorite part” of Thursday’s win.\nJohnson’s enthusiasm about his new role comes from a simple place.\n“It’s bigger than me,” Johnson said. “We’re trying to do something historic here. That’s bigger than me. We want to win. That’s the main thing, and it’s everyone’s goal.”\nAnd the Clippers have one of the league’s great veterans reminding them of their goal in Pierce.\n“It’s just what’s about best for the team,” Austin Rivers said. “… Paul started his whole career. We know he’s not complaining about it. He’s a Hall of Famer and he’s not said a word about it. So, if he’s not complaining, I’m surely not complaining.\n“It’s about the team.”\nThe message from Johnson, Rivers and Pierce echoes the words of former Sixth Man of the Year Jamal Crawford, who said earlier this week he was “so far in” on his belief in the plans for the second unit.\n“Everybody understands the big picture. Everyone wants to win,” Pierce said. “You have a lot of guys here who have made a lot of money in their careers, signed contracts and played a number of years. What’s left? You have to ask yourself ‘What’s left?’ For me, it’s another championship. And when I ask other guys, they say the same thing.”\nWithout Crawford – he sat with a triceps injury that Doc Rivers called not serious – on Thursday, the bench needed someone else to step up and score late.\nEnter Pierce, who electrified the crowd with four 3-pointers in the final quarter, helping the Clippers steal the win.\n“I’ve seen that act before,” Doc Rivers said.\nAnd what will ultimately make this bench a success is that the team won’t need to lean on Pierce every night for those kinds of shots.\n“This group has firepower,” the Clippers coach said. “I don’t think you can figure out who it’s going to be.”\nAnd for this to work, for the team to keep playing the hot hand, it’ll take time.\nThursday wasn’t the final product, merely a glimpse at the foundation.\n“Guys are going to continue to understand their roles better as we practice more, as we play together more,” Pierce said. “It’s going to take time. We’ve got new players and it’s still trying to come together. There’s an adjustment period, and we got off to a slow start. We’re still trying to figure each other out.\n“… You can see that it’s building.”\nContact the writer: dwoike@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T14:40:08.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
