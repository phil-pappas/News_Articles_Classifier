Going into district play, there are still six undefeated teams and another seven which have only one loss. \nIn all, 20 of the 32 teams are .500 or better. That’s pretty good stuff. \nWe also know Mill Valley made the right move in ramping up its schedule two years ago and now the Jaguars are legitimate Class 5A title contenders. And that Pittsburg may reap some of the same benefits with its move from the 4A-dominated Southeast Kansas League. \nSome traditional powers (Holton, Conway Springs, Centralia) enter district play with lengthy postseason streaks possibly in jeopardy. Some rising powers are ready to prove their might. \nFor Class 6A and 5A, this is it. Next year, neither class will have to worry about districts as they move to an eight-game regular season and every team makes the playoffs for their ninth game. \nFor the rest of the state, well, it’s play by different rules and follow the same format. \nThat hardly seems right, but then again, it doesn’t seem right for geography to be the biggest determiner as to which teams make the playoffs in the first place either — regardless of class. \nSo here goes my final district analysis for 6A and 5A and another round of picks for 4A and 3A. \nCLASS 6A \nBest — There are three really strong candidates for this honor in Districts 4, 5 and 8. District 4 boasts No. 1 Lawrence (6-0), Olathe North (6-0) and Olathe Northwest (5-1) as well as a solid Olathe East. District 5 has No. 3 Topeka High (6-0), 5-1s in Manhattan and Washburn Rural and a 3-3 Free State team which knocked off defending champion SM East two weeks ago. But the nod goes to District 8 where No. 2 Wichita Northwest and Garden City are both 6-0, Hutchinson is 5-1 and Dodge City is 4-2. \nWorst — And here-in lies the big schools’ biggest beef for districts. With three districts loaded, there are also three which are terribly weak. Defending champ SM East (5-1) is grouped with three teams in District 1 which have combined for three wins. Blue Valley (4-2) has two one-win teams to go with a winless one in District 3. But District 6 is the winner where 6-0 Junction City has all of its district wins as Wichita East, Wichita North and Wichita Southeast are all 0-fers. \nDistrict champions — SM East, SM West, Blue Valley, Lawrence, Free State, Junction City, Derby, Hutchinson. \nDistrict runners-up — SM North, BV North, Olathe South, Olathe North, Manhattan, Wichita East, Wichita South, Wichita Northwest. \nCLASS 5A \nBest — This one isn’t even close. District 3 is just loaded as No. 1 Mill Valley (5-1) must also contend with No. 4 St. James Academy (6-0) and No. 5 Bonner Springs (6-0) — two of the three remaining unbeatens in 5A. One of those teams is going to look at the playoff bracket and be wishing next year was here already. \nWorst — Again, there isn’t any competition for this (dis)honor. The combined record of the four teams in District 2 are 1-23. Topeka West (1-5) has the lone win among itself, Seaman, Shawnee Heights and Highland Park. The foursome has been outscored 1,130-256 this year. \nDistrict champions — Leavenworth, Seaman, Mill Valley, Aquinas, Kapaun, Salina South, Carroll, Goddard. \nDistrict runners-up — Lansing, Shawnee Heights, St. James Academy, Pittsburg, Emporia, Salina Central, Maize South, Eisenhower. \nCLASS 4A DIVISION I \nBest — Last year, District 8 was a runaway winner for the best district. This year, it still gets the nod. No. 2 Buhler and No. 5 Abilene are still 6-0 entering district play, while McPherson is 4-2. Hays is 2-4, but just picked up a quality win over 6A Wichita South. No other district is as top heavy or deep. \nWorst — There aren’t any real stinkers out there with most districts having at least two solid teams. With KC Piper having a down year, let’s go with District 1 where 6-0 Atchison is the only team above .500. \nDistrict champions — Basehor-Linwood, Miege, Eudora, Fort Scott, Augusta, Hayden, Ulysses, Buhler. \nDistrict runners-up — Atchison, Louisburg, DeSoto, Paola, Independence, Andover Central, Mulvane, McPherson. \nCLASS 4A DIVISION II \nBest — It says quite a lot about a district when perennial power Holton comes in as the team with the worst record in its group. But District 1 has just that where Holton is only 3-3 and must deal with No. 4 Royal Valley (5-1), Perry-Lecompton (4-2) and Jefferson West (3-2). \nWorst — The lone district without a team over .500 is District 6, where Chapman’s 3-3 mark is the best of the bunch that also includes 2-4s Nickerson and Smoky Valley and 1-5 Wamego. \nDistrict champions — Holton, Osawatomie, Girard, Columbus, Andale, Chapman, Concordia, Holcomb. \nDistrict runners-up — Perry-Lecompton, Prairie View, Anderson County, Frontenac, Wichita Trinity, Nickerson, Clay Center, Pratt. \nCLASS 3A \nBest — A couple recent hiccups from Kingman kept District 11 from being the overwhelming pick with 6-0s Halstead and Garden Plain leading the way. I’ll still give it a slight nod over District 4 where No. 1 and defending champion Rossville (6-0) and No. 4 Silver Lake (6-0) are headed for yet another showdown (or two) and District 12 where Hesston, SE-Saline and Council Grove are all 5-1. \nWorst — Even with Sabetha having a couple solid wins and solid near-misses, their 2-4 mark matches Riverside for the best record in District 1 — the only district without a team with a winning record. Hiawatha and Horton are both winless. \nDistrict champions — Sabetha, Nemaha Central, Maur Hill, Rossville, Wellsville, Colgan, Neodesha, Cherryvale, Chaparral, Wichita Collegiate, Halstead, Hesston, Riley County, Norton, Hoisington, Scott City. \nDistrict runners-up — Riverside, Centralia, Pleasant Ridge, Silver Lake, West Franklin, Humboldt, Caney Valley, Conway Springs, Wichita Independent, Garden Plain, SE-Saline, Washington County, Beloit, Ellsworth, Cimarron.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:26:11.217+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
