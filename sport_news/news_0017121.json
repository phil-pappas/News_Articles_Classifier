But, La Grande, who entered the game scoring more than 50 points in each of its last three games, rebounded to defeat the Bulldogs 50-27. La Grande (2-0 in the GOL) earned at least a share of the league crown with the win. Baker (1-1 in the GOL) can still earn a Class 4A state berth by defeating Mac-Hi at Milton-Freewater Friday. “We had a good week of practice and we took the field thinking we could play with La Grande,” said Baker coach Dave Johnson. “Then we had a couple of good defensive stops and a short field early.” But, as quickly as Baker started, La Grande rallied. The Tigers took advantage of seven Baker turnovers a big plays on third and fourth down to outscore the Bulldogs 50-14 the rest of the game. “They were the better football team,” Johnson said of the Tigers. “They made more plays than we did. Our hats off to them.” Johnson and his coaching staff said they couldn’t remember a Baker team committing seven turnovers in a game before. Ironically, it was one of four La Grande turnovers that led to Baker’s first touchdown. Marcus Plumley intercepted Andrew Peasley’s pass on the third play of the game setting Baker up with a first down on the La Grande 10. Two plays later Plumley scooted around left end for a 7-yard score. Luke Ham’s conversion kick gave Baker a 7-0 lead with 10:26 left in the first quarter. La Grande’s second miscue led to Baker’s second TD. Baker forced a Tiger fumble — Ryan Schwin recovered on the La Grande 33 — on La Grande’s second offensive series. The Bulldogs needed just one play to score when Brian Zemmer connected for 33 yards with Grant Berry. Then, La Grande mounted its comeback. Peasley scampered 37 yards on the first play following the kickoff to set up a 22-yard scoring run by Ray Jimenez. La Grande then took the lead for good with 2:09 left in the first quarter when the Tigers went 91 yards on five plays. Facing first down on his own 9, Pealsey found Zach Jacobs on an 83-yard pass to the Baker 8. A high snap lost 29 yards back to the Baker 37, but Peasley then connected on a 19-yard pass to the 18. Peasley then scrambled away from at least two Baker sack attempts before finding Alec Cranford in the end zone. The pass bounced off a Baker defender’s hands and Cranford gathered it in. La Grande later added another touchdown in the second quarter to take a 21-13 halftime lead. The bottom then dropped out from under the Bulldogs in the third period. A short Baker punt and three turnovers in the quarter allowed La Grande to score 22 points and pull away. One bright spot was an 89-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by Baker’s Brandon Stairs. Johnson said the Bulldogs will get back at it today. “We’ll come to work Monday,” he said. “We need to win on the road this week and then come what may after that.” La Grande outgained the Bulldogs 439 yards to 315. Zemmer finished 20-of-35 passing with four interceptions and 245 yards. Berry had seven catches for 77 yards, and Stairs six for 104 yards.
