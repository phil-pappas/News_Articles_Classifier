He put the work in and he got through to the end and it was a hard fight for me. \n\"It was a flash knockdown. It was a good shot, but I knew Dale could hit. I had a comfortable first round, which made me ease off in the second round. I was a bit lackadaisical. He caught me sweet and I went down.\" \nEggington's victory was revenge for defeat to Evans in the fourth fight of his career in January 2013, and the 22-year-old refused to rule out another rematch. \nHe added: \"I don't think I will be out again this year, but we will have to see what happens next year. If he is there, then why not? I felt a bit tired in the run-up and in the fight. I feel like I need a rest.\" \nThe first round passed largely without incident, but the fight then burst into life when Evans produced a shock knockdown with a perfectly measured punch. \nHowever, Eggington composed himself brilliantly and then bounced back with a superb third round that set the tone for the rest of the fight, picking off Evans with pinpoint shots to both the head and body. \nThe fourth and fifth rounds followed in much the same vain, but then Eggington strangely switched off in the seventh and eighth and allowed Evans back into the fight. \nA clash of heads in the ninth left both fighters with cuts and covered in blood, and when Eggington reasserted his authority with some bludgeoning shots in the 10th and 11th, it became a difficult spectacle to watch as Evans hung on desperately. \nHowever, he returned for the 12th round and, in a 20-second spell that typified his brave performance, he rocked the previously dominant Eggington with a flurry and left the champion momentarily dazed. \nEvans didn't have the energy to capitalise, though, and Eggington was able to see out a victory that was far harder than anticipated. \nEvans said: \"He has been training for a long time to do 12 rounds. I knew that as the fight went on, I would struggle and he would come on stronger. He was the deserved winner tonight.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:30:35.149+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
