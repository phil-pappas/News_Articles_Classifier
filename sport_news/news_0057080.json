(AP Photo/Gail Burton) (GAIL BURTON) Comments \nNEW YORK â€” Who's the Yankees ' second baseman next year? \nIt would figure to be a mix of Rob Refsnyder and Dustin Ackley, and maybe it will, but manager Joe Girardi didn't sound exactly enthusiastic about that idea on Friday in his postmortem press conference on the 2015 season. \n\"I thought [Refsnyder] improved at Triple-A over the course of the season,\" Girardi said. \"I think it's...you look at him, you look at what's available and you make a decision.\" \nLook at what's available? Maybe they'll bring back Robinson Cano? \nRefsnyder hit .302 with two home runs in his 16 games (plus no errors in 51 chances) with the big league squad and yes, as Girardi also said, it's a small sample size, but if you extrapolate that into a full season it equates to 20 home runs and an above-average defender. For context: only two big league second baseman hit 20 home runs in 2015. PLUS : Why didn't Brett Gardner steal in 2nd half? Joe Girardi doesn't know \nAnd Girardi didn't sound much more comfortable with the idea of Ackley playing second base full time either. \n\"I think you look at [Ackley],\" Girardi said. But I think that's something that will have to be addressed this winter.\" \nRyan Hatch may be reached at rhatch@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @ryanhatch .
