Somewhere silly, which is where this story belongs. Not out of the newspaper entirely – ahem – but somewhere with perspective, the kind of perspective that gets easier as time passes and we can move past the what on earth stage and into what doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger and maybe – maybe today – to that was sort of funny . \nLike, let’s do this. Let’s be real about That Play, the fourth-and-3 fake punt where the Colts sent nine players off to the side and had little bitty receiver Griff Whalen line up at center, with safety Colt Anderson behind him at quarterback. Or punter. Or something. Facing three Patriots defenders, all of them much bigger than he is, Whalen snapped the ball to Anderson. The play failed, the crowd groaned and the country laughed. It's still laughing. Doyel on Colts fake punt: Pagano watches as we laugh at Griff Whalen \nSo let’s laugh here. Let’s give that play a name, something better than That Play, something honest and fun and … hey, here’s an idea. Let’s call That Play the Shar-Pei Punt. Or the Shar-Plei. Ever seen a Shar-Pei puppy? Little wrinkly thing. Comes out of its momma looking like a 90-year-old man. So ugly, it’s adorable. \nThat Play: so ugly, it was adorable. \nNow that it’s over, anyway. \nBut to get here, to end this thing once and for all, we had to ask Pagano about it. We had to ask Whalen. And Anderson. We’d like to have asked Pat McAfee, the punter who shed the only light anyone has shed on That Play, but he’s removed himself from the hysteria since telling Bob & Tom on Tuesday that Whalen hadn’t practiced that play at center. Whalen was acting as a replacement for Clayton Geathers, who left the Patriots game with an injury. \nThe reason it looked like Griff Whalen had no idea what to do? \nHe had no idea what to do. \nThat Play pretty much ended the Colts’ upset hopes on Sunday against the hated Patriots, and that’s serious, but the game is over and it’s not coming back, which is why Pagano channeled his inner, um, Bill Belichick on Wednesday and made the following his mantra: \n“Our total focus is on New Orleans.” Colts coach Chuck Pagano: 'I don't regret the play call at all' \nFive times Pagano said that or something very close to that – “Our focus is on New Orleans and New Orleans only” – much as Belichick in 2014 had famously said “We’re onto Cincinnati” five times after the Patriots’ own gaffe the previous Sunday, a 41-14 loss to Kansas City. \nPagano was being unintentionally silly, starting his press conference Wednesday with a statement about That Play and then daring any of us to ask him about it by saying he was open for questions “about New Orleans.” \nNice try, Chuck, but I didn’t come here to write about New Orleans. Smiley face emoji goes here. But really. And so I asked him if he was going to ignore me if I asked about That Play. \n“Our total focus is in New Orleans,” he said. \nA few minutes later I went for the softball, telling Pagano his players love him, that I happen to like him as little bit myself, but it’s unseemly that he never told the media he was asking Whalen to play a role he hadn’t practiced, resulting in the gaffe that has made Whalen a national punch line. \n“I don’t pay any attention to any of the outside noise,” Pagano said. “Our focus is on New Orleans.” \nHe doesn’t pay attention to the noise, yet knew enough about it to open his press conference with an unprompted statement about That Play: \n“As far as that play goes,” he said, “I categorically reject any criticism that has fallen on any of our players or coaches.” \nA few minutes later, Colts beat writer Stephen Holder asked Pagano about all the criticism – all the attention – that has been on him since the first game. Holder was referring to Pagano’s lame-duck contract status, the alleged rift with general manager Ryan Grigson, That Play, and more. \nPagano was listening, and he was smiling, and he was shaking his head. And then he was coughing. And coughing. When he could finally get air down his throat, he said: \n“It threw me off when Gregg said he liked me. I mean, Gregg said he liked me.” \nTen feet away, I clarified that misquote. \n“I said ‘a little.’” \nBehind the podium, Pagano held his thumb and index finger an inch apart. Which is about right. And then he smiled some more and told Holder that he doesn’t worry about all the criticism, all the attention, coming his way this season. \n“They can’t eat ya,” he said. “That’s my motto: They can’t eat ya.” \nThey tried – we tried – to eat Griff Whalen. We surrounded his locker Wednesday to ask him about being left out in the open by Pagano, left there to take all the blame until McAfee came to his teammate’s aid. Whalen refused to be eaten. He called McAfee “a good teammate” and said he “didn’t hear any of the chatter in the media.” \nSatisfied, the media left Whalen – except me. Come on, Griff. You didn’t hear any of the chatter? \n“Well,” he said, “I got a few texts: ‘Don’t worry about what everybody’s saying.’ I’m thinking: Oh boy – there must be some stuff out there. But I honestly didn’t look at anything. Everybody in this building is on the same page, and I could care less what happens outside of it.” \nAlmost on cue, one of Whalen’s newest and largest teammates walked past and stopped. Defensive tackle Billy Winn put his hand on Whalen’s chest and his eyes on me, and he said of Whalen, “This is my guy right here.” Colts prepare for Drew Brees and the New Orleans Saints after another difficult loss to New England \nMessage delivered. I caught up with Winn later, telling him I liked what he’d done for Whalen, and we talked about leadership for a few minutes. Winn said he learned from D’Qwell Jackson and Joe Thomas in Cleveland, and is learning from Dwayne Allen and Coby Fleener here in Indianapolis. \nBack at his locker, Whalen was telling me one more thing before the interview ended, the last interview either of us hope to do about that Shar-Pei of a football play. And this is what Whalen said, which sounds like he's channeling Pagano channeling Belichick. Whatever it is, it makes for a decent epitaph of a dead horse: \n“We’ve already put it behind us,” Whalen said. “Our focus is completely on New Orleans.” \nFind Star columnist Gregg Doyel on Twitter at @GreggDoyelStar or at www.facebook.com/gregg.doyel .
