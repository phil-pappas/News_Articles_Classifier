It’s the secret ingredient to success for a college basketball team, and it’s a top priority for Seton Hall as the Pirates prepare for the 2015-16 season.\nSixth-year head coach Kevin Willard feels good about the collective mindset of his roster, which is a blend of talented sophomores, senior transfers and collegiate newcomers.\n“It’s been a lot smoother than it was last year,” he said of the fit. Last year, the Pirates finished 16-15 after a 12-2 start as personalities clashed.\nHere’s more of what Willard had to say about his squad on the eve of Friday’s first full practice:\nQ. What’s your general impression based on preseason workouts?\nA. “I think this is our most athletic group, the best defensive group that we’ve had, our most versatile group since I’ve been here. We have a lot of guys who can guard different positions.”\nQ. Does that mean more running and pressing?\nA. “As long as we stay healthy, we’ll be able to press more and be more aggressive on defense, which we haven’t been able to do. We’ve played softer on the defensive end the last couple of years. We’re a little longer and a little more athletic now. We’re going to play more aggressively and be able to get away with it, whereas we couldn’t get away with that the last couple of years.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:06:31.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
