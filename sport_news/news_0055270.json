By Stefanie Loh Seattle Times staff reporter \nBERKELEY, Calif. — Washington State played its most complete game of the year, but it wasn’t quite enough to knock off No. 24 California, and the Cougs fell, 34-28, to the Golden Bears in their Pac-12 Conference opener on Saturday afternoon. \nCal, meanwhile, improved to 5-0 for the first time since 2007. The Golden Bears are also 2-0 in Pac-12 play. \nQuarterback Jared Goff passed for 390 yards and threw four touchdown passes to help Cal rally from what was a 21-7 deficit late in the first half. \nThe game came alive in the third quarter, after Cal foiled a WSU fake punt attempt on fourth down and the Golden Bears’ Stefan McClure ran the fumble back for a 45-yard touchdown to cut WSU’s lead to 21-20.
