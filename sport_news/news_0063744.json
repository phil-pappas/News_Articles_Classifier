The incident occurred Sunday around 12:43 p.m. in the 1100 block of Joe Yenni Boulevard.\nAccording to police, a man was driving a Nissan west on Joe Yenni Blvd. when he lost control of the car. The vehicle left the roadway to the left-hand side and flipped, prior to landing in the canal. Rescue crews pulled the man's body from the water and transported him to Ochsner Hospital in Kenner, where he was pronounced dead.\nThe investigation into the accident continues, but police believe that the rainy weather and speed may have been factors in the crash.\nWe will have more information as soon as it becomes available.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
