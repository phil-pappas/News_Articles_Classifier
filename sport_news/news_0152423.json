Oscar Combs believes the 2016 Cats are winning the National Championship. \nOn Tent City Live, Oscar told Matt that this year is Kentucky’s year. They have all the right pieces to make up a championship team – a vengeful Alex Poythress and arguably the best point guard in the country. \n“Cal’s in overdrive now,” Oscar said. “Tyler Ulis is gonna be as good as anybody in the country. I’m not gonna say he’s the best, but I’m gonna say I haven’t seen anybody better.” \nOscar said Kentucky will still probably lose five or six games, but at the end of March, the BBN will be smiling. \nIf you aren’t WATCHING or LISTENING then you’re missing out, because they’re just getting started.
