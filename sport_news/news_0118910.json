I don’t feel no one can stop me. You can get Darrelle Revis, Richard Sherman — whoever you want to get.”\nNow, we get to see that matchup … maybe. Jackson has not played since Week 1 because of a hamstring strain. He practiced last week but did not play against the Falcons on Sunday. Revis laughed off the barb from Jackson on Monday.\n“That’s DeSean, man,” Revis said. “He’s very confident in his game and he should be. He led the league in most explosive plays last year (13 plays over 40 yards).\n“I’ve got a lot of respect for him. He makes plays. He shows up on Sundays and does what he needs to do.”\nRevis and Jackson have met twice in their careers. In 2011 when Jackson was with the Eagles and Revis with the Jets, Jackson had two catches for 28 yards. They met again in 2013 when Revis was on the Buccaneers. Jackson had six catches for 64 yards and two touchdowns in that game.\nRevis said as much talking as Jackson does off the field, he’s quiet on it.\n“He doesn’t trash talk,” Revis said. “If he makes a big play, then he does his dances and things like that. He don’t talk. He just goes play.”\nRevis said he hopes Jackson can play Sunday.\n“We want to play against the best,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:32:54.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
