A A A \nIf ever there were a time for College of the Canyons football to get a wake-up call, this was it. \nCOC suffered its first loss of the season last week in an ugly 19-3 setback at Saddleback College. \nThe two best takeaways from that game may have been the fact that it was a non-conference game and it conveniently occurred right before a bye week. \nNot only does that mean the Cougars (5-1 overall, 2-0 in National Division, Northern Conference play) remain undefeated in league competition, it also means they get an extra week to prepare for a difficult schedule and heal up. \n“The main thing is we wanted to get healthy. We wanted to decompress a little bit. … More than anything we were just kind of limping through that bye week so we could get to this week,” said COC head coach Ted Iacenda. \nSo far COC, ranked sixth in the most recent state rankings, has played two teams ranked in the state’s top 25. \nThose games resulted in a 30-6 COC win over then-No. 1 Mt. San Antonio College and last week’s loss to 17th-ranked Saddleback. \nOf the four remaining opponents on COC’s schedule, three of them are ranked: Cerritos (seventh), Ventura (10th) and Allan Hancock (12th). And all of those games are given added importance because they’re conference contests. \nIacenda insisted that the team isn’t viewing it as a tough four-game stretch, instead opting to put all its energy into this Saturday’s contest at Allan Hancock, which is a 140-mile drive away in Santa Maria. \n“We’re going to talk about Hancock this week and what we need to be successful on this long road trip,” he said. \nThe good news is this team has the playmakers capable of doing it. \nThe Cougars rank fourth in the state in scoring defense, holding teams to an average of 17.3 points per game. \nThose numbers are helped by the fact that this unit has tallied 21 sacks and has forced 14 turnovers, 11 of them interceptions. \nThe pass-rushing effort has been led by defensive ends Weston Wells and Brodie Felkel, who both have a team-high four sacks. The team’s takeaways have been remarkably spread out between a host of linebackers and safeties. \n“I don’t think there’s one main guy where you can say, ‘That’s our guy.’” Iacenda said of the defense. “We have a lot of those guys. They’re hard-working, blue-collar, nose-to-the-grindstone type of guys.” \nDuring the Cougars’ five-game win streak, a lot of those forced turnovers came at key moments in games, and some helped spark the offense. That type of production from the defense could play an important role in COC’s fate these next four weeks. \nOffensively, Canyons has shown some big-play ability, but also a lack of consistency in finishing drives. The team’s eight touchdowns in 18 red zone trips ranks 59th in the state, and that has played a part in the Cougars’ 51st-ranked scoring offense (23.7 points per contest). Losing 11 fumbles and having seven passes picked off also hasn’t helped their cause. \n“They’re little things. They’re very correctable. They’re lack of focus on a play,” Iacenda said of the mistakes on offense. He said the key will be “harping on those little things and getting that focus level we need to be able to finish games.” \nCanyons has found the most success when quarterback Devon Dunn gets the ball in the hands of receiver and Valencia graduate Nick Jones, whose 687 receiving yards ranks second in the conference and ninth in California. \nFellow wideout Vincent Strange was also a big part of the offense in the four games he played (19 catches, 311 yards, two touchdowns) before a season-ending ACL injury ended his season. \nAt running back, freshman Kenny Torrence is the team’s primary man in the backfield. He leads the team with 336 rushing yards. \nCOC has clearly done enough thus far to warrant its ranking, but it will be continually tested in the coming weeks. \nAnd that’s why this final stretch of the season will be very revealing, for better or worse.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:20:14.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
