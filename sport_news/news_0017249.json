Chris Christie for holding her against her will, according to the ACLU .\nKaci Hickox’s lawsuit claims that she was deprived of due process and was unlawfully seized, detained, and quarantined. In addition to Christie, she is also naming former New Jersey Department of Health Commissioner Mary O’Dowd and other officials within the department in the suit.\nAfter her New Jersey quarantine, Hickox rose to fame last year when she ignored requests from Maine Gov. Paul LePage and other state officials to remain in her Fort Kent home. A Maine judge later ruled that she could not be forced into quarantine, but must submit to daily health monitoring and inform officials of any changes to her health or travel plans for three weeks.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below When Hickox was returning home from Sierra Leone last October, she had a layover at Newark Liberty International Airport. Despite the fact that she was not showing any symptoms of Ebola, she was ordered to be held first at the airport, and then later at University Hospital in Newark, according to the ACLU. A blood test for Ebola came back negative, but Hickox was held for two additional days as part of a mandatory quarantine for those returning from West Africa who had come in contact with Ebola patients.\nDuring that time, Hickox was quarantined in a tent in a parking garage at University Hospital without heat or a shower, according to the ACLU. After being held for a total of three days, she was cleared to return to Maine.\n“I never had Ebola. I never had symptoms of Ebola. I tested negative for Ebola the first night I stayed in New Jersey governor Chris Christie’s private prison,” Hickox said. “My liberty, my interests and consequently my civil rights were ignored because some ambitious governors saw an opportunity to use an age-old political tactic: fear.”", "external_links": ["https://www.aclu-nj.org/files/7014/4554/5483/Hickox_v_Christie_Complaint_home_addresses_redacted.pdf", "https://www.aclu-nj.org/news/2015/10/22/nurse-sues-over-nj-quarantine-during-ebola-panic"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:09:57.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
