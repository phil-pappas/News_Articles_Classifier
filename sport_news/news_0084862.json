A lot of rehabbing to get ready. You never lose belief in yourself. I know I can play the game, play better, play faster. [Thursday] was just a small reward. Small. That's all it is. It's one game.\"\nRead, who was hindered by a high ankle sprain last season and scored a career-low eight goals, said it was \"definitely good to kind of get the monkey off your back right away. I thought our line played very well together. We had a lot of scoring chances in the first two periods, and then kind of just played defensive hockey in the third. It was like, ['Which team] is going to make the first mistake in the third?' \" \nLaughton caused a turnover and set up Read's goal, and the 21-year-old center had a strong all-around performance. He spent last season with the Flyers and Phantoms. \n\"He didn't seem like a nervous guy,\" Umberger said. \"He's had a couple of go-arounds here now, so he knows what to expect. He's been good since Day 1. He's been prepared; he's been mentally ready.\" \nDuring training camp, Laughton seemed \"hungrier, more determined, for sure,\" Umberger said. \"He felt like it was his spot, and he was going to do whatever it took to stay here. This time around, he knew he should be here and deserved to be here.\" \nLaughton, who played with an edge and beat out veteran Vinny Lecavalier for the third-line center spot, said he tries to \"bring speed through the middle\" and create turnovers in the neutral zone. \nLaughton's line played together in just one exhibition game, but the unit seems to have developed a quick chemistry. They held their own Thursday against a heralded Tampa line centered by Tyler Johnson. \n\"We tried to eliminate them [up ice] so they couldn't get in our zone,\" said Laughton, who was unsuccessful on a penalty shot in overtime. \nCoach Dave Hakstol likes the makeup of Laughton's line. \n\"They scored a big goal for us, but I also thought they gave us a lot of real good five-on-five shifts,\" said Hakstol, adding he liked how the unit took care of the puck and was able to spend a lot of time in the offensive zone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T02:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:24:28.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
