After senior running back Devon Sullivan left the game with a high ankle sprain early in the second quarter, quarterback John Dobson and Danny Madden rallied Corning to a brief one-point lead. But Corning’s lead did not hold up. Binghamton’s Deante Witherspoon caught a five-yard touchdown pass from quarterback John Petrucci with 33 seconds left in the fourth quarter to lift the Patriots to a thrilling 41-34 victory over Corning. With the win, Binghamton (5-2, 3-1) clinched the No. 2 seed in the Section IV, Class AA playoffs, while Corning (4-3, 2-2) will assume the No. 3 seed. That means the same two teams will meet again in Binghamton to open Class AA sectional playoffs in two weeks. Things initially looked bleak for the Hawks after Sullivan left the game with a high ankle sprain early in the second quarter. Binghamton scored twice to open up a 27-14 lead early in the third quarter. However, Corning made it interesting thanks to the work of Dobson and Madden, who connected on two second-half touchdown passes as the Hawks faced deficits of 13 and 12 in the second half. Down 33-21, Dobson found Madden on a 61-yard TD strike to pull Corning within five. The Hawks grabbed a 34-33 lead when the same duo hooked up on a 26-yard TD pass with 3:08 left in the fourth quarter. Sullivan scored a pair of first-quarter touchdowns and the game was tied at 14 apiece when he was helped off the field after ripping off a 24-yard run on Corning’s first offensive play of the second quarter. After he left, Binghamton needed a three-play drive to take the lead for good when Rasheen Pettiford hauled in a 12-yard touchdown pass from Petrucci. The Patriots expanded their lead when Petrucci hooked up with Davin Young on a 56-yard TD pass. The Hawks found the end zone on their first offensive possession when Dobson connected with Sullivan on a 36-yard touchdown strike. It capped a 10-play, 65-yard scoring march that began after Binghamton stalled on downs at the Corning 35. Sullivan scored his second touchdown on a one-yard run with 1:47 remaining in the opening quarter. Vitor Moura’s extra point knotted the score at 14-14.
