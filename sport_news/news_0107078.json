In 2015, nearly 800,000 New Mexicans now receive the government health-care coverage for the poor and disabled. And by 2020, that number is expected to close in on 900,000 – nearly half the state’s population.\nWhen Gov. Susana Martinez decided to go along with the expansion, her rationale was two-fold: The feds were dangling as much as $6.2 billion in subsidies for the state through 2020, and the state continued to deal with the financial consequences of an unhealthy population.\nShe told an Albuquerque gathering at the time “access to health insurance has the potential to improve the well-being of our families so our kids can learn better in school and so mom and dad can be better parents and more productive employees.” The Journal agreed and supported the expansion on its editorial pages.\nIt was still the right thing to do. But there are troubling new indications that access to health care doesn’t translate in healthier lives or a healthier population.\nJournal UpFront columnist Winthrop Quigley spoke with professionals from First Choice Community Healthcare, which has spent the last 43 years providing medical, dental and behavioral health care to some of the Metro area’s poorest residents.\nAnd they say that despite all the chronic illness they have controlled, the vaccinations they have given and the teeth they have cleaned, they have ultimately failed to improve the health and wellness of the population they serve.\nFirst Choice CEO Bob DeFelice says “after 43 years, we still don’t see population health.” That kind of sea change takes “jobs, education, early childhood development, access to high-quality affordable food, safety, environmental factors.”\nAnd those can’t all come from the government, despite a huge part of the nonprofit sector that relies on poverty as the state’s No.1 economic driver.\nSo First Choice is pouring around $25 million (from grants, partnerships, donations and revenue generated by businesses) into expanding its medical campus off Isleta Boulevard. There are plans for a Health Leadership High School; a wellness center with fitness, therapy and medical education offerings; a child development and day care center; a farm; walking trails; and 140 new jobs.\nIt’s a different side of the health industry – getting out in front of problems instead of just treating them. Kudos to First Choice not only for the good work it does but for recognizing it was simply treating symptoms and not problems.\nThis editorial first appeared in the Albuquerque Journal.
