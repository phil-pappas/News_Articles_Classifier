(Michael Patrick/Knoxville News Sentinel via AP) KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) Tennessee Chancellor Jimmy Cheek is ''very confident'' there was ''no inappropriate conduct'' between Volunteers coach Butch Jones and a player.\nAdChoices While speaking Thursday to the Board of Trustees, Cheek said there were rumors and misinformation about ''an alleged incident during football practice.'' The chancellor said he and athletic director Dave Hart have ''done our due diligence'' on this matter.\nCheek was responding to message board discussions and reports that Jones had a ''physical altercation'' with center Mack Crowder during a preseason practice. Jones said the allegation was ''absolutely ridiculous.''\nWithout specifically addressing the allegations, Crowder sent out three separate tweets saying he was ''proud ''and ''honored'' to be part of Tennessee's program.\n''I'm proud to be a VFL (Vol For Life) and honored to be a part of this University and Vol FAMILY,'' Crowder tweeted. ''I've given my all to this program and will continue to. I want nothing more than for Vol Nation to come together and get ready to beat the Dawgs on Saturday, as my Teammates, Coaches and I are already working hard to do. Everything else is just a distraction.
