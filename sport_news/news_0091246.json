The controversial Sumedh Singh Saini has been asked to make way for Suresh Arora. The new DGP comes with a reputation for being an outstanding police officer-he is honest, hard-working, and brave. He makes an excellent replacement for Saini who had unfortunately allowed himself to get his priorities wrong. The far-from-professional performance of the Punjab Police in recent weeks can easily be traced to its flawed leadership. Though Saini had worked up a perfect juggalbandi with the Home Minister, the Chief Minister has been around long enough to understand when an officer ceases to be an asset-and, like an unsentimental practitioner of politics, he has let go of Saini. A working police force, professionally- led, is the chief instrument of good governance. But it has been obvious to any reasonable observer that a dangerous gulf has developed between the administration and the people. The police heavy-handedness was only aggravating that gulf. Parts of Punjab were experiencing anarchy-type situation. This is unprecedented-and, unacceptable-state of affairs, especially in a border state. It was only natural that the highest functionaries in New Delhi were getting concerned as to what was happening in Punjab. It must be presumed that the advice from New Delhi prompted a rethink in the Badal household. The choice of Suresh Arora as the new leader of Punjab Police is an inspired move. The new DGP has his task cut out: to restore professionalism as the working mantra for his men and officers. The unhealthy, unethical and undesirable nexus that has been put in place at the \"halka\" level needs to be questioned. This blatant politicization has eaten into the vitals of the police force. Like in any other part of India, the police force cannot be allowed to function as the personal militia of the incumbent political leadership. The Punjab Police needs to become a people's police, a fair and just force.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:06:09.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
