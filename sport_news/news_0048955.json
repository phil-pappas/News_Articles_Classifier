And with just one ranked team left on their schedule, the Vols have to feel pretty good about finishing the year with a solid record. Even though the song 'Rocky Top' has died down from Tennessee's signature win over Georgia, the echos of that victory can still be felt. Said safety Brian Randolph-\"There's a different atmosphere around our facility and class. Everywhere you go. It's just a great week for Tennessee.\" Perhaps dampening the atmosphere a bit was the loss of defensive lineman Shy Tuttle for the year with a broken leg. Said head coach Butch Jones-\"That's a situation where all of our players are devoleping there. We just need to continue to recruit numbers as well. Like we know, this is a line of scrimmage league.\" Tuttle's injury is part of the adversity Tennessee is dealing with, just like the adversity Florida has with the sudden loss of quarterback Will Grier. Said Randolph-\"That's one of our main goals to win the SEC East and get to a championship. We still have a chance for that. For Grier it's very unfortunate, but it does kind of leave the door open for us.\" For Tennessee to win the East, that means they'll have to beat Bama in two weeks. Jones-\"Arguably the best defensive front in the country. We're going to be challenged. They're big and physical, but we've also played some very good fronts. Josh Dobbs made his college debut against Bama two years ago, and he got his welcome to the SEC moment. Now Dobbs heads back to Tuscaloosa after playing the best game of his career. \"I've seen a lot obviously in my years here. Definitely an exciting opportunity to go back down to Tuscaloosa to play and compete again.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:02:41.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
