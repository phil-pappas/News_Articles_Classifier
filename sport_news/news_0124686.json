You own it. If we own it and we each, including me, take our responsibility in the unsuccessful performances, we can correct them and turn them hopefully into successful ones. If the girls can do that because I have already learned to do it at this advanced age of my life. But if the girls can learn how to do that and they do that and they own their part and take their responsibility to change it, we can come back from it. Otherwise, no, we can't.\" \nNorthwestern held a 15-8 edge in shots over Notre Dame but couldn't get one past Crusaders goalkeeper M'Kenna Murphy . The Tigers hit posts with two shots in the first 10 minutes of the game but that was the closest they could get to a goal. \n\"We had opportunities but none of our shots were effective,\" Bleam said. \"I guess you have nights like that where you shoot the ball and it doesn't go in. But our girls need to concentrate harder through their shots and through their shooting. We made a couple of pretty bad mistakes obviously and gave up a couple goals.\" \nIt was the second straight 2-0 loss for the Tigers, who lost by the same score to Palisades on Thursday. \nNorthwestern is also dealing with injuries as senior defender Haley Hebelka and sophomore midfielder Catherine Willis look to be out for the season. \n\"Both are good opponents. That's part of it,\" Bleam said of the two-game losing streak. \"We're definitely struggling through some injuries, which doesn't look like necessarily that we're going to get two of those players back at all for the rest of the season. So certainly that's an issue. But it's part of the season for every team where you get a couple injuries and you have to try to solve the problem. We're not solving the problem well at all. Trying to move people around and figure out where people go late in the season. You know, usually you do that early in the season so if you lose a couple games, it's no big deal. But when you have to do it late in the season, other teams are good.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:38:03.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
