USA TODAY Sports Oct 25, 2015 at 2:04p ET 0Shares \nFlorida State took a precipitous drop in The Associate Press poll, dropping out of the top 10 and falling eight spots to No. 17 after they were stunned by Georgia Tech on a blocked field goal returned for a touchdown Saturday night. Florida, which was idle this week, rose two spots to No. 11. \nTop-ranked Ohio State picked up 11 first-place votes following Utah's first loss of the season. \nThe Buckeyes (8-0) have been No. 1 all season, but had been losing first-place votes in recent weeks. This week, Ohio State had 39 first-place votes in the poll released Sunday after routing Rutgers. \nBaylor, Clemson, LSU and TCU -- the rest of the top 5 -- also received first-place votes, as did No. 7 Alabama. \nUtah had its highest regular-season ranking after climbing to No. 3 last week, but dropped 10 spots after losing to unranked Southern California. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T20:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T22:08:45.719+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
