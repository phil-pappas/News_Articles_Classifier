He’s currently appealing the conviction. Lloyd’s body was found in an industrial park near Hernandez’s North Attleborough, Mass. home. \nOrtiz and Ernest Wallace, both from Hernandez’s hometown of Bristol, Conn., have also been charged in the murder. Wallace’s lawyers have already sought to dismiss the murder charge against their client. \nHernandez also stands accused of killing two men outside a Boston nightclub in 2012. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:06:47.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
