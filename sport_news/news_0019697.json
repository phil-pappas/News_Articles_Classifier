He's understandably disturbed and probably a little untrusting of the Mavericks' organization, which twice has let him walk away in free agency.\nCoach Rick Carlisle said he would never hold that against the best center in franchise history. In fact, Carlisle is an advocate of retiring Chandler's number some day, even though he only played for the Mavericks in two one-year stints.\n\"Tyson is one of the most special people I've met in my 33 years in this profession,\" Carlisle said Wednesday morning after the Mavericks' shootaround. \"He knows how I feel about him and he has every right to feel the way he feels. He truly is one of the all-time great Mavericks, there's just no doubt about it. And this past summer was the byproduct of the high-stakes things you go through in this league, the risks you take. We attempted to get the team significantly younger. It didn't work out and he decided to leave, so that was certainly his prerogative.\n\"We have nothing but the utmost respect for him. It's my hope - and this of course is not my decision - that one day he will get consideration to have his number retired here. I think he deserves that consideration. And I know Mark really has great respect for him, even though the way things went twice. There are people that feel he doesn't, but I know Mark has a lot of respect for Tyson and a lot of gratitude for what he did for us, as do I and our fans.\"\nCarlisle was quick to add that it won't be his decision on whether Chandler's No. 6 one day graces the rafters at American Airlines Center. But if he had a vote, he'd be all for it.\nPart of Carlisle's stance on Chandler comes from the impact he has seen Chandler have at all the stops he's made recently, including the championship season in 2011 for the Mavericks.\n\"My opinion is that he's worthy and more than worthy based on history and just because he's such a special person on top of it,\" Carlisle said. \"I know he's in a good situation and he's really going to help Phoenix.\n\"He's a franchise changer. We were close but couldn't get there and he got us over the top in 2011. New York was a perennial non-playoff team and he went there and injected a lot of life and he and J-Kidd got them to the playoffs. He came back here and we were a 50-win team. Now he's going to Phoenix and he'll drastically impact their culture in a very positive way. He's a very special player.\"\nWho might not ever have as soft a spot in his heart for the Mavericks as they do for Chandler. That's what happens when you are not made a priority for a franchise to keep - twice.\nOn Twitter:\n @ESefko", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ESefko"], "published": "2015-10-21T20:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:59:48.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
