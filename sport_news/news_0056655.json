Senior Jagger Cornelious added 77 yards on 17 carries. \nSophomore quarterback Joseph Walezonia passed for 31 yards and rushed for 42, but Valley View could not overcome five lost fumbles and an interception. \n\"They scored four touchdowns off turnovers,\" Valley View Coach Sean Cochrell said. \"I'm disappointed because I felt like we played hard, extremely hard in the first half and third quarter, then just kind of fell apart.\" \nSenior quarterback Tarik Jones completed 11 of 16 passes for 173 yards and a touchdown for Forrest City. \nForrest City (4-1, 2-0) scored on its first possession, but Nettleton came right back to take a 7-6 lead. \nThe Mustangs led 14-7 after scoring on a 30-yard pass from Jones to Leon Smith with 7:13 to play in the second quarter and adding a two-point conversion. \n\"I thought our defense played really well,\" Cochrell said. \"Forrest City is a good team and has a lot of athletes, and I thought we played well with them.\" \nJohnson's 5-yard run with 8:25 to go in the first quarter capped an 8-play, 70-yard drive to give the Mustangs a 6-0 lead. The two-point conversion attempt failed. \nValley View countered with a 13-play, 67-yard drive that ended on a 3-yard run by Walezonia with 1:13 to play in the first quarter. The Blazers then recovered an onside kick, but couldn't move the ball and turned it over on downs. \n\"I read an article where their coach said their plan was to hold the ball and control the tempo and for a half that's exactly what they did,\" Forrest City Coach Rich Trail said . \"I thought their game plan was excellent and then it fell apart in our favor a little bit in the second half. I know the score won't show it, but we're lucky to get out of here with a win.\" \nForrest City outgained Valley View 208-100 in the first half. \nNeither team scored in the third quarter, but Dee Howard returned a fumble 30 yards for a touchdown and Gamario Banks returned another fumble 43 yards. \nJohnson's second rushing touchdown, from 6 yards out, put the game out of reach. \nBATESVILLE 45, PARAGOULD 0 \nBATESVILLE — Louis Sonnier ran for three touchdowns as Batesville (3-2, 2-0 5A-East) downed Paragould (0-5, 0-2). \nSonnier’s third touchdown was a 57-yard run. \nDemetrie Holliday passed 11 yards to Zach Griffin, Kylan Robinson ran 17 yards and Kyler Epperson ran 15 yards for Batesvile’s other touchdowns. \nRicardo Terreauz kicked a 26-yard field goal and made five extra points. \nGriffin was 9 of 16 for 178 yards on 9 completions in 16 attempts.
