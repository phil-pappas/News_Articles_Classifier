Crunch coach Rob Zettler confirmed the move after the game, won by Hartford 4-3.\nGudlevskis was needed to give Lightning goalie Ben Bishop a rest. Bishop played in Tampa Bay's win at Winnipeg on Friday; Gudlevskis is expected to be in net when the Lightning visits Chicago on Saturday.\nThe Crunch is in the midst of a three-in-three weekend, traveling to Utica on Saturday and Rochester on Sunday. Adam Wilcox got the start against the Wolf Pack and he was backed up by Allen York, who was recalled from Greenville of the ECHL.\nContact Lindsay Kramer anytime: Email | Twitter | 315-470-2151", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/LindsayKramerPS"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:47:11.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
