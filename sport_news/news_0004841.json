He will leave for Brazil in the wee hours of Saturday.

Sporting a light blue shirt and trouser with black shoes, Pele stood silent on the dais even as Air Marshall Raha addressed the crowd. \nBut the Delhi football fans did have an evening they will cherish throughout their lives as they saw the man who is known by many names, including the Black Pearl , King Pele or King of Football , from close range in flesh and blood. \nJust after arriving at the stadium and several people trying to come close and get autographs from him, Pele was asked to proceed to the ground so that the players of the two teams and match officials could introduce themselves. \nPele, who has had three surgeries this year, including the recent one in his hips, struggled to get down from the dais and onto the ground. He clutched his right hand on his walking stick while the left hand was held by a companion even as another Air Force officer lent him support. \nIt was a sight a football fan would not have wanted to witness as the legend grimaced and showed discomfort and his foot landed at every of the 10-odd steps from the dais to the ground. \nThe indomitable spirit of the Brazilian, who was part of the World Cup winning teams of 1958, 1962 and 1970, then came to the fore as he battled his way to the ground and once he entered into the playing arena, Pele suddenly wore a smile as if the feel of the grass suddenly gave him extra strength. Hethen waved to the crowd who responded wildly. Â© Copyright 2015 PTI. All rights reserved.
