We had an amazing turnout.” \nIn its 13th year, Lake Wylie Children’s Charity helps families with children battling life-threatening diseases. Last year’s event raised $53,000, Presley said. \nThe concert is typically held on the lawn at T-bones and includes games, a bake sale and silent auction. \n“We could not have done this without the support of T-Bones, the bands who played, DJ Big Sexy, and Carolina Panthers mascot Sir Purr,” said Jennifer Joye, the charity’s executive director. “We especially want to thank those who donated to our silent auction, those who donated bake sale items, and all of our wonderful, dedicated volunteers.” \nFor more about the charity, visit LKWChildrensCharity.org .
