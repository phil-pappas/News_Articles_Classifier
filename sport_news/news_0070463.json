Playing on the road against a solid Alamosa team( 5-4-1, 4-3-1 3A Region 5), the Bayfield boys soccer squad came away with a 0-0 draw against the Mean Moose. “It was a great effort from the boys,” said BHS head coach Dave Foster. “It was our first shutout this season and first in the last three years a coach for me. The defense did well.” Foster credited freshman defender Dylan Doskocil for taking away Alamosa leading scorer Moises Juarez. The draw came only one week after Alamosa charted a 7-0 win against the Wolverines. “We played them last week, so we were confident in our gameplan,” Foster said. “We controlled the game defensively and with possession. We had a lot of shots, but none fell into the net for us.” BHS goalkeeper Austin Bushnell made 14 saves in the match for yet another double-digit save performance this season for the junior. Still seeking their first win, the Wolverines (0-7-1, 0-7-1 3A Region 5) will compete at 11 a.m. Saturday against Crested Butte (4-4, 4-3 3A Region 5). “We’re looking forward to it after this result. We have a lot of energy, and the guys are happy,” Foster said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:11:04.889+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
