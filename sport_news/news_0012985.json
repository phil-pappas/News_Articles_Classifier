The teams have been on divergent paths since the Pats’ 45-7 dismantling of the Colts on Jan. 18 at Gillette Stadium.\nThe Patriots?\nThey’ve been dealing with the ongoing and seemingly never-ending Deflategate scandal, which was triggered by their overmatched opponent from Indianapolis.\nThey also haven’t lost a game since the Colts dropped a dime to the league about the Pats allegedly deflating footballs.\nIn short, the Pats won their fourth Super Bowl, had a parade, said goodbye to shutdown corner Darrelle Revis and sidekick Brandon Browner during the offseason, saw Tom Brady win the appeal of his four-game suspension in federal court, and have started the 2015 season unbeaten at 4-0.\nIn other words, they haven’t missed a beat.\nThe Colts?\nAfter vowing to get past the Patriots once and for all and doing whatever it took to make that happen after being whipped by their rivals for the sixth straight time, and fourth straight with Andrew Luck at quarterback, the Colts have done little to make that a reality.\nThey’ve gone from being one step away from competing for a championship, to now being considered one of the falling stars in the AFC. They’re no closer to beating the Patriots and no closer to making a breakthrough than they were in January. If anything, they’ve regressed.\nThey stocked up on players who are in the twilight of their careers, which is fine, except none of those players did much to help their two biggest areas of weakness, the defensive and offensive lines.\nMaybe that’s why lame-duck coach Chuck Pagano and general manager Ryan Grigson are sparring in a not-so-discreet manner. There also have been rumors of Pagano being replaced by Sean Payton, Nick Saban or pick any one of the popular names making the rounds.\nAnd did we mention there are some people who’d rather see veteran Matt Hasselbeck start ahead of Luck, or, more to the point, want the franchise quarterback, who has missed the past two games because of injury, to play more like Hasselbeck?\nTurns out 40-year-old Hasselbeck has the Colts on a modest two-game win streak, as he was able to squeak past the lesser lights of the league, the Jaguars and Texans.\nThe bottom line with Hasselbeck is the powers-that-be want Luck to adapt some of the veteran’s qualities. Translation? Get rid of the ball quicker, and make fewer mistakes. Luck, who tends to hold on to the ball, making him more prone to getting pummelled or sacked, needs to think about compromising because his woeful offensive line can’t hold up very long.\nSo now the Colts, who are lucky to be 3-2, have added so much baggage to the mix as a backdrop before entertaining the Patriots Sunday night at Lucas Oil Stadium.\nIf they couldn’t beat the Pats last year when they weren’t in turmoil, how are they possibly going to stand up to a team that has crushed them six straight times and wants to do worse damage this time out?\nOn a good day, without all the internal drama causing issues, they’d still have a hard time not getting creamed by Brady & Co., who are on a major roll and seem capable of weathering any storm.\nLuck is 0-4 in his career against the Patriots, losing by an average of 29 points. It’s still not known if he’s going to start, or if it’ll be Hasselbeck, who has gone 48-of-76 for 495 yards with three touchdowns in his two starts.\n“This is certainly a big game, it’s the next game,” Luck said, speaking with reporters in Indy on Monday. “It is a very, very good team that’s undefeated coming to town, and there is certainly a history between us and them. But it’s also a new year, and you have to take care of business at home.”\nIt is a new year, but the history and the Colts’ current state can’t help but play into this looking like it might turn into a slaughter.\nThe Cowboys put up a good fight for a half on Sunday, throwing up a defensive front the Pats weren’t expecting, and still got smoked in the end. They played in a 3-2 dime defense, essentially daring the Pats to run the football, and even with fewer guys up front still created pass-protection problems when Brady dropped back to throw.\nThe Colts don’t have the personnel to replicate what the Cowboys did, so don’t even think about a copycat situation.\nNaturally, the Patriots coaching staff played up the Colts and made them sound like giant-killers.\nWe’ll see. Right now, they still look like two teams that are worlds apart — even if they met in the AFC Championship Game nine months ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:17:06.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
