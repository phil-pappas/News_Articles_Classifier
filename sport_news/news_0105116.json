Wolves owner Glen Taylor confirmed it Friday when he said Saunders won't return this season due to complications in his cancer treatment. \nSaunders was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma early in the offseason, and it was believed at the time that he'd make a full recovery and likely even coach much of the season. However, setbacks in his treatment led to Milt Newton taking over front office duties and Sam Mitchell being named interim coach. From the Star Tribune : \nFive days before his team opens its regular season, Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor said Friday that coach and president of basketball operations Flip Saunders won't return this season because of complications resulting from his treatment for cancer. \nDiagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma in June, Saunders has been hospitalized since early September. \nWhen asked Friday if he expected Saunders to return to his jobs, Taylor paused and said: “Not this year. I just think his illness, I mean, it's serious. At this point, if he came back I still think he'd have a hard time to recover all his energy and all that because he has been in the hospital for a long time.” \nMitchell has previous coaching experience in Toronto and even won Coach of the Year while leading the Raptors on the sidelines. He was a part of Flip's assistant staff last season and has even interviewed for the Wolves' coaching position in the past. \nSaunders has given Mitchell and Newton the go-ahead to make changes to the roster if an opportunity arises, as they continue a rebuilding project that began last summer when Flip hit the reset button on their roster by dealing Kevin Love for future franchise player Andrew Wiggins . Saunders is the all-time winningest coach in franchise history and the only coach the team has been to the postseason under. \nMitchell has coached the team all through training camp and preseason. \n(USATSI)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:00:35.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
