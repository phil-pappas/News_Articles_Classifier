Jim Bowling \nSullivan’s Brooke Tuttle chips on to the green at hole No. 7 during the girls golf regional at the Oak Terrace Golf Course near Pana on Wednesday. \nPANA – As one golf coach was keeping tabs with his players, he asked his top player if she was keeping up with Lauren Chappell. \n“Yeah,” she quipped. “I got three holes-in-one and now we’re tied.” \nThe two-time defending state champion from Charleston was strong throughout a 4-under 68 round for regional play at Oak Terrace Golf Course on Wednesday. \nNo one came close to Chappell – in fact, her two closest competitors were Trojans teammates, Morgan Sherwood (86) and younger sister Paige Chappell (88). Add in Aislinn Parish’s 93, and the top four Charleston players were all in the top seven. \n“I love being a part of this team,” Sherwood said. “It’s so much fun, because we win. That’s what we know, that’s what we do. That’s a great credit to Lauren and the other girls.” \nIt’s the latest version of what’s been a very solid group around the state champ. Now trying for a third straight team berth at state, the Trojans are hitting their stride. The 335 is their best score at a course away from home. \n“This being at a different course, this was good knowing that we can go to a course we don’t know very well and still shoot well,” Lauren Chappell said. \nChappell shot a six-birdie round, including a strong finish where she birdied the last two holes thanks to her old reliable – good putting. Both putts ranged close to 12 feet, and it was enough to elicit a smile. \n“I really zoned in on the last two holes wanting to make birdie and get into the 60s,” she said. \nHer younger sister broke the mark she was aiming for, too. Paige Chappell slipped under 90, and it’s the latest round where she’s been a part of Charleston’s top three. It’s the continuation of the freshman feeling more herself after pushing too much at the start of the year. \n“Yeah, I was expecting too much of myself,” Paige said. “Now, I’m kind of comfortable, I know what to expect. I was expecting more to play like my sister, which isn’t really how I play.” \n“Paige, when she first came on, she was a little tentative and a little nervous,” Charleston coach Deb Landsaw said. “Man, she has come on like gangbusters right now. I’m really proud of her.” \nShe’s found a role and a spot within a team of Chappell, Sherwood, Parish and Ally O’Dell that has been together for the last two years at state. And she’s fitting in with the team goal of trying to hit 80. \nTwo years ago, the group around Lauren shot in the 100s both rounds at state. Last year, they dropped 36 strokes while mostly shooting in the 90s. \nThey’re hoping to keep that trend up. \n“We’ve been breaking a lot of records and shooting pretty good, so we’re feeling pretty good going into state,” Lauren Chappell said. \nThey have a big test coming up at Monday's Rochester Sectional (at The Rail Golf Course in Springfield), where the Trojans will be in a field that includes last year’s third place team -- the host Rockets. Rochester returns everyone from last year, including runner-up Morgan Savage. And don’t count out Williamsville, which was right behind Rochester on Wednesday. \n“That one kind of worries me about some of the bigger schools that we’re going up against,” Landsaw said. “Rochester, we played in a tournament that we were in, and they were significantly lower. \n“I want to get through that sectional as a team.” Birds of a feather \nMeridian senior Cole Babcock didn’t only advance himself to sectionals on Tuesday, he helped a teammate do so Wednesday. \nHe worked with sophomore teammate Grace Miller on her chipping and putting, and she said it helped her make the sectional cut after missing by two strokes last year. \n“My short game, by far,” Miller said of what’s improved. “I got some help from Cole a few weeks ago, and my chipping and putting – my putting still needs some work – but my chippings improved.” Brave onward \nMount Zion senior Liz Bird wasn’t thrilled with her round of 98 at Oak Terrace, but it was enough to advance individually. \n“Just a little off today. My wedges saved my game,” she said. “My biggest issue was probably my driver and putting – the greens around here, the ball lipped out around the very edge.” \nBefore she plays The Rail on Monday, Bird has one thing on her mind. \n“Probably just work on my grip, because my grip was giving me issues,” she said. \nOn to Rochester \nTuscola, led by Sydney Hoel and Emma Semnti, took third as a team to advance to sectionals. \n“I’m really happy for our girls,” coach Matt Franks said. “Beautiful day to play golf. I think as a group collectively, it’s good to see them reward themselves.” \nOther advancing individuals including Okaw Valley’s Grace Harlin, Sullivan’s Brooke Tuttle, Taylorville’s Kay Cee Robinson and Miranda Coy, and Pana’s Olivia Kamer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:44:10.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
