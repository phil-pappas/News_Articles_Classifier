Show Caption Previous Next \nFlorida won the first two sets and Tennessee couldn't swing the momentum in the third as the Vols fell 25-19, 25-11, 25-23 in a volleyball match on Wednesday at Thompson-Boling Arena. \nThe Vols (17-5, 3-4 SEC) entered the match in search of their first back-to-back wins over top-25 teams since 2012. \n\"We put ourselves in a position to win the first and third set, but unfortunately, we made some unforced errors we had not been making in transition,\" Tennessee coach Rob Patrick said in a school release. \"That hurt us a little in terms of being able to close out the third set and being able to push through in the first set.\" \nAfter Florida won a lopsided second set, Tennessee led the third set 22-18 after a kill by Kendra Turner and an error by Florida. \nBut the Gators (12-4, 4-3) regained momentum to close out the match on a 7-1 run. \nSophomore Kanisha Jimenez led Tennessee with nine kills and added five digs. Raina Hembry had six kills and four blocks. \nTennessee continues its three-match homestand when it plays South Carolina on Sunday at 1:30 p.m. \nMen's Tennis: Tennessee is playing host to the USTA/ITA Men's Ohio Valley Regional Championships starting Thursday and runs through Monday. \nBoth the Goodfriend Tennis Center on campus and the Knoxville Racquet Club will be used Thursday through Saturday.
