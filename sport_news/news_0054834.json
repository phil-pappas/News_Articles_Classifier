By Lori Nickel of the Journal Sentinel Oct. 11, 2015 7:23 p.m. (0) Comments Lori Nickel/lnickel@JournalSentinel.com Latrese Turner and her daughter Serinitee, 6, participated in the Zumba for Bazoombas event Saturday at the Elite Club in Mequon, which benefited ABCD. \nLatrese Turner of Milwaukee had been away from Zumba for about a year, and she missed it, so when she heard about a Zumbathon event at the Elite Club in Mequon, she signed up right away. \nThat the event, Zumba for Bazoombas, also benefited ABCD — After Breast Cancer Diagnosis — made it all the more rewarding, because two members of Turner's family have battled breast cancer. \n\"That is near and dear to my heart,\" said Turner, who brought her 6-year-old daughter, Serinitee. \"They're survivors. This was doubly meaningful for me to come here.\" \nExercise has been linked to lowering the chances of getting cancer and also to lowering the odds of recurrence for survivors. And for a lot of people, Zumba is a great way to sweat out a lot of stress without really even feeling like you're working out. \n\"I came here because I like to exercise,\" said Turner. \n\"Mom, you don't like to exercise,\" said Serinitee. \n\"She doesn't see me when I exercise!\" laughed Turner. \"But Zumba is fun.... It was time for me to come back. This will push me.\" \nAnd that's why Zumba is here to stay. \nThe Latin dance exercise began in 2001 with easy-to-follow salsa, cumbia and merengue dance moves that can progress to the faster, more complicated dances for anyone who wants to go there. Better yet, Zumba has expanded to include African and Indian dances, hip-hop music and other styles of dance to vary the music and the moves. \nThere are classes everywhere — fitness clubs, schools, even churches — and a good Zumba instructor makes all the difference in the world. \nKelly Bullard has been a Zumba-licensed instructor since 2007 and a trainer of other Zumba instructors since 2009. She's traveled to 36 countries to teach Zumba, and when she's actually home in Mukwonago she teaches at the Lions Club in Genesee Depot. \n\"This past summer I trained in Miami with Beto Perez — the creator of Zumba — to perform in the 2015 Live Fitness for over 8,000 people,\" said Bullard. \"Teaching Zumba has taken me to countries in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. \n\"Zumba is in over 180 countries. Countries where there are many issues of politics, poverty or war still manage to bring people into Zumba classes to experience the joy, empowerment and provide temporary relief.\" \nBullard is an energetic fireball with long, tight blonde curls and whip-cracking limbs, and she will draw anyone into her class with a big smile and big moves. But the best part of Zumba is the makeup of any class. \nGrandmothers dance next to college girls, cancer survivors groove next to those in wheelchairs, and tall and short, thin and curvy all blend together in a happy, sweaty mob. You may hear some Zumba people say they don't sweat, they sparkle — but it's really fun, an hour escape from worrying about work, or what's for dinner, when you're just trying to keep up in here. \nStill, intimidation holds back a lot of people. They think they can't dance, they think they can't swivel their hips (like that!), they think they have to have a certain body type or they think the class is just for women. \nThrow all of that out the window. \nIt's the most inclusive group of people you will ever find. \nThe instructor shows the moves and you \"mirror\" them by following along. Before you know it, you'll be picking up the steps and practicing them while waiting in line at the grocery store... \nWhat? That's not weird at all. \n\"There is no right or wrong way to move,\" said Bullard. \"The instructor uses nonverbal cueing, so there is no one telling you which way to move, which means you are not wrong if you go the other way. If you do happen to go the opposite direction of the group, it is your own solo at that moment so it is OK!\" \nLynn Sokolowski teaches pump, Pilates, spin and body flow, but as a Zumba instructor at Elite since 2007, she said it's not crazy for her to burn 600 to 800 calories in her Zumba class. \nAnd those bellydancing moves that make some of us look like awkward Elaines can help tighten and tone. \n\"I always notice how much I'm using my core muscles in Zumba,\" said Sokolowski. \"You're doing different moves so you're using different muscles. You use your obliques a lot and your transverse abdominis — the abs closest to your spine. A crunch will only use the top of your abs, but this will go much deeper.\" \nShe's worked with clients such as Gloria Sanut Tarrer, who has lost 100 pounds since starting Zumba. \nMarla Primack, who was leading the Zumba for Bazoombas event Saturday at the Elite club in Mequon, said she even looks for the shy and intimidated and tries to work with them first. \n\"I teach to the back row,\" said Primack. \"I have my front-row divas, they've got it down, they're ready to be seen. But I want to make sure the back row has it, too, so I will always give them modifications until they get the moves.\" \nBullard said Zumba provides high calorie burn, muscle toning, improved coordination, balance and rhythm, improved endurance, and mental, emotional and social benefits \n\"This keeps participants interested and engaged, while taking their minds off of stress,\" she said. \"They eventually notice they are no longer the one in the back corner of the room in the baggy sweats, but over time have eventually made their way rocking out the moves near the front of the room. Confidence grows, waistlines shrink and happiness expands. \n\"They find success and adhere to this workout as it feels like 'exercise in disguise.'\" \nThat's probably the best fitness benefit of Zumba. Anyone at any size and age can dance, and Zumba brings people like Turner back. \n\"A lot of times people ask me, 'What is the most effective workout?'\" said Sokolowski. \"It is the workout that you will continue to do.\" \nMore on ABCD: The proceeds from the Bazoombas event went to ABCD. This is a one-on-one support network. Diagnosed patients are paired with a match specialist, said Judy Mindin, and supportive conversations are conducted over the phone. \n\"The idea is that you're mirrored with someone that has gone down the path that you're about to go down,\" said Mindin. \"Different things are important to different women. Some say, 'It's not even about my diagnosis; I'm going to lose all my hair.' Or, 'How much weight am I going to gain?' Or, 'How long is treatment going to go on?' A lot of women have marital problems. Or, they want to know how they will tell their children, because they are little.\" \nThe one-to-one contact is what makes ABCD unique. \n\"It's the personal one to one — we live in a world where that is just vanishing,\" said Mindin. \"People don't talk to each other any more, they don't reach out to each other. We don't touch each other in a way we should. We're social beings and science has proven that women and men who are going through treatment, if they have the emotional support, they do much better.\" \nLori Nickel writes about health and fitness for the average person.
