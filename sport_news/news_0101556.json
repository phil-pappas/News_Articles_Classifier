Their 0-8-0 start to the season was the worst since the New York Rangers lost their first 11 games in 1943-44. \nCoach John Tortorella got his first win with Columbus after taking over prior to Thursday's game in Minnesota, replacing fired Todd Richards. \nThe Blue Jackets trailed 3-2 entering the third but tied it on Murray's first goal of the season 3:56 into the period. Dubinsky had a goal disallowed in the second, but then gave Columbus the lead when he scored on a rebound 2:47 after Murray's tally. \nJarome Iginla had a goal and an assist for Colorado, which fell to 1-3-1 at home. Semyon Varlamov stopped 32 shots. \nThe Avalanche pulled Varlamov for an extra skater with 55 seconds left and the teams skating 4-on-4. \nIginla's goal 1:43 into the second tied the game, and he set up Nathan MacKinnon for a power-play score late in the period to give Colorado a 3-2 lead. \nJenner had given the Blue Jackets a 2-1 lead with a pair of goals in the first period. His first midway through came off a turnover at the blue line by Avalanche defenseman Nick Holden. Later, Jenner deflected David Savard's shot from the point on the power play. \nSavard finished with two assists. \nJack Skille scored 2:21 into the game to give Colorado a 1-0 lead. \nNOTES: Blue Jackets C Ryan Johansen was sent home to Columbus on Saturday morning because of illness. ... Avalanche D Brad Stuart (back) was scratched for the fifth time in seven games. He is considered day to day. ... Columbus is now 5-2-1 in its last eight games in Denver. ... Avalanche D Tyson Barrie served the last of his three-game suspension for his hit on Anaheim D Simon Despres on Oct. 16. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:27:39.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
