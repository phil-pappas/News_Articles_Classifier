The ninth straight win, however, was a chore. \nAlabama trailed deep into the third quarter before a home run sent the Crimson Tide to a 27-14 win on another strange night in Bryant-Denny Stadium. Scoring 24 points in the final 16:39 can erase the preceding issues. At times, it was just as difficult as last year's 14-13 escape in Fayetteville that followed consecutive 52-0 Tide wins. \nFamiliar issues held down the Tide ― turnovers, missed kicks ― as it controlled the game even after falling behind late in the second quarter. The 89-yard touchdown pass to Calvin Ridley gave Alabama the final lead at 10-7 with 1:39 left in the third. A failed fake punt led to the next Tide score and a 3-yard pass to Richard Mullaney.It was all the separation Alabama's defense needed. \nAgain, it wasn't pretty despite outgaining the visitors 396-220. \nFamiliar formula \nBoth teams jogged to the halftime locker room after a lopsided first half. Alabama outgained Arkansas 204-77, controlling the game for the most part. \nYet it trailed 7-3. How? \nIt felt a little like the Ole Miss game when turnovers changed skewed an offensive edge. Alabama punted just once in the first half as two drives ended on interceptions and two others on missed field goals. \nAlabama's defense certainly wasn't to blame. The only Razorback touchdown came on a 12-yard field following an interception magnified by Cam Robinson's unsportsmanlike conduct flag. Through four possessions, 36 of Arkansas' 40 yards came on two passes. \nAfter two possessions each, Alabama had the ball 11:20 to Arkansas' 3:54. The Razorbacks entered as the No. 3 team nationally in time of possession. \nThe Tide's first two drives went 13 and 14 plays, respectively. Both penetrated the Arkansas 10 yard line but third-downs came up dry both times. Adam Griffith made the 24-yard field goal on the first one but missed a 25-yarder on the second. \nOn the first drive, Alabama ran twice with Derrick Henry after reaching the 10. A five-yard gain was followed by a 2-yard loss and the third-down pass fell incomplete. Three Jake Coker passes were thrown after reaching the 13 on the second drive. A completion to Halt Hentges was followed by two misses and an unsuccessful field goal. \n\"We have to finish drives in the red zone,\" Saban said at halftime. \"We out-gained them, we had better time of possession, they only scored on us from the 8-yard line because of a turnover. We've got to take care of the ball, we can't turn the ball over, and we've got to finish drives in the red zone. We missed two field goals...I mean, we've just got to finish things.\" \nThe Tide outgained Ole Miss 503-433 in a 43-37 loss on Sept. 19 after the Rebels scored 24 points off Alabama turnovers. \nCoker's INTs \nComing off his best performance of the year, Coker had a few rough patches early Saturday evening. A mistake-free game at Georgia was followed by a first half with two different varieties of interceptions. \nThe first appeared to be a classic poor decision, throwing off his back foot into coverage while getting hit. Coker's lofted pass was intended for O.J. Howard, but went to Josh Lindell instead. These are the plays Saban loathes the most since he values the game management and careful decision making of a quarterback. \nThe second turnover was a high throw that hit Mullaney's hands. The deflection went straight to Santos Ramirez who ran it 18 yards. Arkansas scored three plays later to take the 7-3 lead. This one wasn't as much of a poor decision, perhaps just too much mustard on the throw. \n\"I should have caught it,\" Mullaney said. \"Coker gave me a chance to catch the ball and that's on me.\" \nIt wasn't the first pass that hit a receiver's paws without a catch. Also in the second quarter, a deep ball on a double move to Calvin Ridley was underthrown, but the freshman got to hands on it. \nThe 81-yard touchdown throw from Coker to Ridley late in the third made up for that. \nHangover? \nAfter an emotional win at Georgia, the natural question concerned Alabama's juice to start Saturday night. There was no letdown ― not if you were watching closely. \nIt allowed a 15-yard pass on the first play when run-heavy Arkansas came out in a five-wide, no back formation. After that, Alabama held Alex Collins to four yards on two carries and an incomplete pass. The 13-play, 80-yard drive that followed saw Coker complete his first five passes before missing his target on third-and-goal. \nRed-zone conversions and the two turnovers led to the 7-3 Arkansas halftime lead. But Alabama controlled the pace and Arkansas didn't manage much of anything offensively. \nSaban said there wasn't a letdown, there were just a few mistakes that led to the surprising halftime deficit. \nAlabama D flexes \nArkansas runs the ball, but Alabama sealed the middle this time. It ran for just 44 yards on 25 carries, by far the lowest output of the year. The previous low was a 103-yard afternoon in an upset loss to Toledo. Arkansas averaged 204 rushing yards a game before Saturday night. \nLeading rusher Alex Collins managed just 26 yards on 12 attempts. His five-yard run in the third quarter was the longest by any Razorback running back. \nThe most successful plays for Arkansas were passes. Through four possessions, 36 of Arkansas' 40 yards came on two passes of 15 and 21 yards respectively. Ultimately, 111 of 220 total yards came on four throws. \nThe Razorbacks were held under 200 yards until Brandon Allen's 54-yard touchdown pass to Dominique Reed with 1:37 left.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:12:40.151+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
