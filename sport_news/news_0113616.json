They visit Humphreys on Friday. \nThe Warriors fell to 2-2 overall, just hours after they learned their homecoming game on Friday was one of two games against Osan that were canceled due to the Cougars’ lack of players. \n“We looked like a team that’s played four games” since the start of the season Sept. 4, Daegu coach Phillip Loyd said of Monday’s performance. “We’re still finding our way. We just have to get better.” \nThe Warriors got rushing touchdowns from Josh McCaw and DeAndre Rosalie, their two prime offensive weapons. Rosalie rushed 15 times for 35 yards and was 9-for-19 for 54 yards passing. McCaw ran for 113 yards on 10 carries. Jarvis Stokes paced the Daegu defense with 18 tackles. \nIf Daegu cannot replace the two games with the Cougars, that would leave the Warriors with just a four-game regular season entering the D-II title game, which they will host against Yokota. \nSingapore football teams play regularly against their DODDS counterparts in Korea and Okinawa, and have gone 9-3 against them since 2009. \nThe Falcons are comprised of players from the two teams that play regular-season games sponsored by the Singapore American Community Action Council, their equivalent of military youth services. Singapore American School historically has not sponsored American football as a school activity. \nAlmost every year, a handful of Falcons players sport U.S. ID cards, either as dependents of servicemembers, who number about 600 in Singapore, or dependents of State Department employees at the U.S. Embassy.
