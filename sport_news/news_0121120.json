Several other recent recipients are well on their way to Cooperstown. Regardless of the odds, earning an MVP places you on the short list of greatness. Here are the five in the American and National League who have the best chance to gain this unique honor.\nAdChoices American League\n© Jae C. Hong/AP Los Angeles Angels' Mike Trout smiles while taking batting practice before an exhibition baseball game against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Friday, April 3, 2015, in Anaheim, Calif.\n5. Nelson Cruz, Mariners\nThe transition from Camden Yards to cavernous Safeco Field wasn’t as difficult as originally predicted. Cruz kept up the power surge he enjoyed in 2014, having belted 44 home runs so far in 2015 (one off the MLB lead). He’s also managed to keep his batting average above .300. Despite a second half improvement, Seattle fell below expectations and will end up fourth in the AL West. If not for Cruz, it would have been a whole lot worse.\n4. Manny Machado, Orioles\nPerhaps some of the power that Cruz left behind after his one year in Baltimore rubbed off on the Birds’ third baseman. The 23-year-old has already set career highs in home runs (31), RBI (79), and stolen bases (18) after suffering an injury-plagued campaign in 2014. A more encouraging sign for Baltimore was that his defense is as stellar as before. An MVP won’t be coming his way, but the Comeback Player of the Year Award should.\n3. Lorenzo Cain, Royals\nBeing witness to his incredible range and fielding sense in center during the 2014 playoffs, it’s hard to believe Cain didn’t win the Gold Glove at that position. One honor he can shelve away for 2015 is an All-Star appearance (his first). There were plenty of reasons to include him on the roster, namely on offense. Cain’s 71 runs batted in are 18 more than he’s produced in any year. A solid final weekend would result in a second straight season batting over .300.\n2. Mike Trout, Angels\nA third straight MVP is likely going to elude the face of baseball. But a chance at redemption in the postseason may not. The Angels have risen to be in contention for the second Wild Card spot. Trout has contributed to the revival, batting .316 with eight home runs, 15 RBI, and a 1.085 OPS. His Wins Above Replacement (WAR) for the entire season stands at an AL-high 9.1. That number says Trout has the most value in the league. A closer look reveals otherwise.\n1. Josh Donaldson, Blue Jays\nWhen Toronto made Donaldson their main winter acquisition – trading for him in exchange for Brett Lawrie and three other prospects – it got many to question if this would be a move that would pay off for the Jays. To date, 41 homers, 123 RBI, a .952 OPS, 350 total bases, and 122 runs scored as the franchise will make its first playoff appearance in 22 years. Are there any questions now?\nNational League\n© Brad Mills/USA TODAY Sports Bryce Harper is the expected MVP of the National League, and Josh Donaldson may be the surprise MVP of the American League.\n5. Andrew McCutchen, Pirates\nThis year was again proof to how impactful he is to the Bucs’ success. The Pirate center fielder was going nowhere fast at season’s start – hitting a woeful .194 in April. But did you really think he wasn’t going to turn it around? As McCutchen regained his form, so did Pittsburgh. The club has the best record in baseball since May 22, with Andrew posting a batting average well over .300 and an on-base percentage above .400 during the past five months.\n4. Nolan Arenado, Rockies\nSometimes, a player’s season is great enough that it really doesn’t matter if the team he plays for is atrocious. Thanks to terrible pitching (exposed even more at Coors Field) and plenty of other missing pieces, the Rockies (and their 66-93 record) are wasting away a 41-home run, 123-RBI season from their star third baseman. He can also field his position as well as anyone. According to the Rockies statistician , \"Last night Nolan Arenado became the 3rd third baseman IN @MLB HISTORY to hit 40 2B, 40 HR & 120 RBI in a season.\"\n3. Yoenis Cespedes, Mets\nHow did the New York Mets go from arguably the worst offense before the trade deadline to maybe the best after it? The best answer is the 11th hour, July 31st deal for the former Tiger. A clutch September (nine HRs, 21 RBI) helped put away the NL East crown. It got many wondering: could Cespedes be the first to ever win an MVP after being traded from the other league in the middle of the season? That won’t happen in 2015, but to even be in consideration is a testament to his influence on the rise of the Mets.\n2. Paul Goldschmidt, Diamondbacks\nLike Arenado’s Rockies, the D-Backs are once again playing out the string in September. But Goldschmidt has some personal accomplishments to play for. Although he won’t eclipse some of the power numbers he put up in his MVP runner-up performance of 2013, he’s on pace to attain a career high batting average (currently .317), on-base percentage (.559) and slugging percentage (.991). But like two years ago, he’s over 30 homers and 100 RBI.\n1. Bryce Harper, Nationals\nIn spring training, Harper’s confidence got the best of him . “Where’s my ring?” he asked, after the Nats landed Max Scherzer. Well, Bryce will have to settle for this individual achievement. However, what Harper did in 2015 goes beyond the MVP. He leads the National League in batting average, slugging percentage, on-base percentage and home runs…all at just 22 years old. During a Nationals season full of frustration and egregious underachievement, Harper was there to carry the heavy burden with his all-out play…maniac closers be damned.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2015/02/26/bryce-harper-vows-bring-title-dc/24055231/", "https://twitter.com/Rockies/status/649671127254482944", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/MLB"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:30:17.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
