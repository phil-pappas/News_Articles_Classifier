Again, Daniel Murphy homered. Again, Jacob deGrom shook off trouble. And again, the Cubs trailed the Mets. Perhaps, they thought, the ivy had turned the tide of Game 3 of the National League Championship Series.

DeGrom throttled the Cubs and allowed two runs in seven innings, extending what has been a dominant stretch by the Mets' dynamic young arms. \nAnd the Cubs stubbed their own toes. The Mets scored the go-ahead run on a wild pitch in the sixth, when Yoenis Cespedes scrambled home on a ball in the dirt that struck out Michael Conforto. \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nOne inning later, a rally powered by a pair of sloppy defensive plays gave the Mets two crucial insurance runs. Tyler Clippard worked a scoreless eighth and Jeurys Familia notched his fifth save and reached 8 2/3 scoreless innings. With rain falling, their victory completed, the Mets shook hands in a reserved celebration. \nSaid first baseman Lucas Duda: \"We haven't won anything, yet.\" Mets NLCS Game 3: Mets vs. Cubs \nOf course, the prospects are bright. For the Cubs to reach their first World Series since 1945, they would have to join the 2004 Red Sox, who knocked off the Yankees, as the only team to erase a 3-0 deficit in the baseball postseason. \n\"One New York team has blown a 3-0 lead,\" Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo told reporters. \"Let's make it the other New York team.\" \nLong Island's Steven Matz takes the ball in Game 4 Wednesday night. But even if the lefty fails, the Mets have Matt Harvey, Noah Syndergaard and deGrom lined up to pitch on regular rest. Mets pitching has a combined 2.79 ERA, the lowest of any team left in the playoffs. \n\"Anything's possible,\" pitching coach Dan Warthen said, smiling. \"But we certainly like our chances.\" \nA boisterous crowd of 42,231 were hoping that the Mets might finally blink.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:13:24.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
