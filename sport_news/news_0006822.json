But, after a strong start, the 27-year-old Russian hasn't been that noticeable.\nWhen the Blackhawks opened camp at Notre Dame, Tikhonov, Teuvo Teravainen and fellow Russian and former teammate Artemi Panarin wowed the crowd on numerous occasions with crisp passing and scoring chances on nearly every shift.\nSince then, though, Panarin has been out with an upper-body injury (he's expected back Wednesday) and Tikhonov hasn't looked the same.\n\"Everybody's got to rely on their own game,\" coach Joel Quenneville said of Tikhonov after practice Tuesday at Johnny's IceHouse. \"When you do get those opportunities (of having quality ice time), you want to look to take advantage of them, regardless of who you're with.\n\"But when you are with some top guys, it'd be a nice day to look good.\"\nTikhonov admitted at Notre Dame that he knows the Hawks' interest in him -- at least in part -- was to make Panarin's transition to life in the U.S. an easier one. Panarin speaks almost no English, while Tikhonov is fluent, having grown up in California.\n\"Most of the interest was obviously toward him. And that's understandable,\" Tikhonov said. \"He's a young player -- super, super talented. Once he signed, they kind of had interest in me and that kind of helped me decide really. One, he's a good friend of mine. Two, at least just for camp, I could always come help him out, translate.\"\nStill, make no mistake: Tikhonov badly wants to be in the NHL again. He played 61 games for Arizona after the Coyotes took him with a first-round pick in 2008, but he hasn't played in the league since. He and Panarin both played on the same KHL team the last two seasons.\nTikhonov told us at Notre Dame how \"incredibly excited\" he is to have this chance, then shared this with me after playing at the United Center in the Hawks' training-camp festival last week:\n\"It was a little surreal. Not even an exhibition game … and (we had) a full house, the national anthem where I had butterflies and almost broke down (in) tears.\n\"It was amazing. It just fills you with energy and excitement. It's hard to describe. But definitely wasn't ready for it.\"\nTikhonov's been around long enough to know he's locked into a numbers game with some awfully talented players.\n\"There's so many good guys,\" he said. \"Everyone's playing great. Just focus on yourself, focus on your game -- that's kind of what I'm trying to do.\"\nThe opportunities are dwindling, though, and a solid showing Thursday in St. Louis would seem to be a must.\nIf Tikhonov doesn't make the final cut, he could accept an assignment to Rockford or return to the KHL. If he went to Rockford, he still would count $90,000 against the Hawks' cap.\nTikhonov said it'll be a tough call either way.\n\"Any decision -- when it's not your No. 1 plan or the thing you wanted -- is always a tough decision,\" he said. \"If that road comes, we'll make that decision (then).\"\n• The Rockford IceHogs signed Daniel Paille, whom the Blackhawks released from training camp Monday, to a professional tryout. The 31-year-old Paille has played in 570 NHL games since the 2005-06 season.\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
