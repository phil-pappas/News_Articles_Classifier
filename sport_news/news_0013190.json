So for me it was very, very important this first set and after I think I was dead.\n“I was trying to stay with him, but he looked so fresh and so energetic, and every point I kept playing I was digging myself in a deeper hole in the second set.’’\nTomic has three tournaments left this season — Valencia, Stockhom and Paris.\nIf the baselines is able to climb two more spots, he will enjoy protection from the high seeds at the Australian Open until the fourth round.\nTomic started the season ranked 71st — and languished at No. 124 little more than a year ago — as he rebuilt form and fitness from double hip surgery.\nHe last month joined a select group of contemporary Australian men to feature in the top 20.\nGrand slam champions John Newcombe, Lleyton Hewitt and Pat Rafter all reached No. 1 under the ATP Tour Emirates computer system, while Wimbledon winner Pat Cash peaked at No.4.\nUS Open finalist Mark Philippoussis (No. 8) and grand slam singles semi-finalists Wally Masur (No. 15), Jason Stoltenberg (No. 19), Mark Woodforde (No. 19) and Todd Woodbridge (No. 19) are among modern Australian players to crack the elite.\n Tomic to reach career-high rank", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent4.video.news.com.au%2Ffoxsports%2Fprod%2Farchive%2F2015%2F10%2F17%2FFSD_171015_TEN_SHANG_QF_DJOKO_TOMIC_VSV.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f6a5dda682451ce8f0fa6a43c38bc249", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/tennis/bernard-tomic-to-reach-career-high-rank-of-18/story-fnibcgxs-1227572935034", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-18T06:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T13:47:55.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
