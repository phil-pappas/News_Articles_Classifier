BAI should have acted immediately and punished the culprits following the bone test. Forget the punishment and ban, BAI is allowing all these players to participate. These fraud players are finishing the careers of may eligible players,\" said a peeved parent, whose daughter lost to one of the overage girls on Saturday. \n\nThe parents are very upset but they are not willing to come on record fearing BAI onslaught. \"When they are not respecting SAI's decision, there is no question they will hear our voice. We have made official complaints to the organizers and BAI but they are still allowing these players to play. If this continues to happen, parents will stop sending their children for badminton practice in future,\" said a mother of a Karnataka player. \n\nWhen asked about this controversy, BAI secretary (tournament) Punnaiah Choudary said they did not get the official report from the SAI yet. \n\n\"The SAI had conducted the medical and bone test before junior ABC tournament but they have not submitted us the official report of the tests yet. Unless we get the official report, we cannot stop the players from participating in the tournament. As and when we get the SAI reports, we will act soon,\" said Choudary. \n\nThe veteran official said if these players are really found overage, they will not be able to play in the same age group. \"We will not totally ban the players but we will direct them to play in the higher age group. They will not be allowed to play in the same age group in which they have found overage. We will direct the authorities and respected state associations not to consider their entries for the present group,\" said Choudary and added he doesn't know when he will get reports from SAI. \n\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:16:24.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
