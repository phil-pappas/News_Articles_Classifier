Because the fall hunting seasons- and the corresponding rush for new hunter to become certified- still are months away, it can be easier to find a class now compared to later in the year. Plus, those who complete the class now, still have time to buy a license and hunt in the upcoming spring gobbler season, and will be able to apply for a 2015-16 antlerless deer license before they sell out. To register for a course in your area, visit GoHuntPA.org and click on “Learn to Hunt” link, or go to the Game Commissioner’s website (www.pgc.state.pa.us), and click on “Hunter Education Classes” icon in the center of the homepage. From here, you can elect to take the basic “Hunter-Trapper Education” course, which is typically a six-hour course held over one or two days. Persons 16 years of age or older also may elect to take a new fully online Hunter-Trapper education course, which also takes six hours to complete. Those who are certified through online course must pay a $19.50 fee upon completion. Successful completion of a basic Pennsylvania Hunter-Trapper Education class, or another state’s equivalent course, is required by state law to obtain a first-time hunting or furtaker license, regardless of age. In addition, registrations are being accepted for other educational programs offered by the Game Commission, including Successful Turkey Hunting, Successful Bowhunting, Successful Furtaking and Bowhunting, Successful Furtaking and Cable Restraint Certifications. The Success Turkey Hunting course is designed to provide the knowledge and skills needed to hunt safely and confidently in both spring and fall seasons. Veterans will learn methods and techniques that will help them become better hunters. Student will receive a 140-page student guide and a diaphragm ticket call as part of the program. Classes started this spring and continue through the summer and early fall. A $15 fee is being charged to offset the costs. The Successful Bowhunting course is a one-day voluntary training program for those seeking to expand their skills and knowledge of bowhunting. Although Pennsylvania doesn’t require archers to complete a bowhunting education course before they purchase an archery license, certification for this course is required to bowhunt in some other states. There is a $20 course fee, which covers the cost of the online study course required before attending the class. Successful Furtaking is one-day training program that provides extensive hands-on training to new and experienced furtakers. The course promotes Best Management Practices and is designed for any person seeking to learn more about furtaking and to improve his or her skills and success. The course includes the cable-restraint certification that is required to participate in Pennsylvania’s cable-restraint season for foxes and coyotes. This course also fulfills the requirement that all first-time furtaker license buyers pass either a basic trapper education course or basic Pennsylvania HTE course. A $15 course fee is charged. The Cable Restraint Certification course is required for those trappers seeking to participate in Pennsylvania’s annual trapping season in which cable restraints are used to capture coyotes and foxes. The course fee is $15, and students get to keep various education materials and one legal cable restraint provided as part of the course. \nThe Outdoors Calendar welcomes information on hunting, fishing, hiking and other outdoors event.
