Whitecwhite@mdjonline.com The Marietta Daily Journal October 18, 2015 12:37 AM | 230 views | 0 | 0 | | McEachern receiver Christian Roberson hauls in a Bailey Hockman pass as he tries to fend off North Paulding High School defenders in the first quarter Friday evening in Dallas. McEachern would beat North Paulding 57-14 in one of 11 county games to be decided by 21 points or more. slideshow The numbers speak for themselves.There were big winners and losers from Friday’s football games with 11 of the 15 contests involving Cobb County schools decided by 21 or more points.Pope had the biggest discrepancy in its score, getting shutout by undefeated Roswell, which is ranked third in Class , 52-0.Seventh-ranked McEachern, fresh of its 35-0 shutout over North Cobb on Oct. 9, took down North Paulding just as easily in winning 57-14, which is 43-point margin.The list goes on as Hillgrove downed Kennesaw Mountain 42-6 (36 point difference), Allatoona topped Hiram 48-13 (35), Kell defeated Riverwood 31-3 (28), Walton beat Woodstock (28), East Coweta triumphed over Pebblebrook 34-7 (27), Newnan trumped Campbell 31-6 (25), Fellowship Christian outlasted Whitefield Academy 28-3 (25), North Cobb eclipsed Marietta 38-13 (25) and Mount Paran Christian survived Christian Heritage 44-21 (23).Two other games, North Cobb Christian over New Hampstead (35-20) and Langston Hughes over South Cobb (28-14) were closer double-digit victories for the winners. Finally, Etowah squeaked by Lassiter for a 10-point 38-28 win and Sprayberry held on for a 9-0 victory against Forsyth Central.A win is a win, but the scores of some victories say a lot more about a specific team than other scores. In addition, there are advantages to blowout wins that go beyond the scoreboard.“The biggest advantage to getting a big win is you get a chance to get your young guys into the game, and anytime those guys get (repetitions), it’s very valuable for them,”McEachern coach Kyle Hockman said. “When you’re on offense or defense, you’re still going to run what you do, and you rarely see teams just trying to run up the score.“It’s about just getting reps for the young guys or keeping the older guys in to get them to work on a few things in case they made some mistakes early on or are having problems in a game. Blowouts are not something you plan for, but you try to figure out how to make the best of it.”It’s a nice situation to have if you’re McEachern, which has won five of its six games by 21 or more points this season. Hockman commented that, during a blowout, sometimes a coach may dig deep into the playbook and pull out a rarely used play just to see what it looks like in a game. But, most often, the reserve players run schemes to which they’re more familiar.“Normally, it’s the second group in and you run what they’re used to seeing,” he said. “It’s a game thing, and you do what the defense gives you or what their offense gives you. When you’re up by a lot, it also helps because you get to see guys in on special teams as well that you normally don’t see.”Walton coach Mo Dixon knows a little about winning and losing big. The Raiders dropped a 48-14 decision to Roswell on Oct. 2, but have since bounced back to post a 49-10 victory over Pope and 49-21 triumph against Woodstock last Friday.“Being on the losing end of it doesn’t feel great at all,” Dixon said. “Every call you make you’re just trying to get something going to stem the tide. And on the flip side, you want to show respect for the other team, but kids always want to score, so it’s a little complicated when you’re the one ahead. But, it’s a better problem to be ahead than behind.”Whether a team is ahead or behind, coaches want to see effort and execution.“We just want to play well and be efficient on offense and defense,” Hockman said. “Blowouts happen. It’s nice to have some, but you also want to see how you handle adversity or how they’ll run a 2-minute drill when it’s needed so they’re ready by the end of the season. You just have to take the situation the way it is and try to play well.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:40:55.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
