Cole Pearn, the crew chief for Martin Truex Jr., was placed on probation by NASCAR on Wednesday because of an illegal adjustment to the car at Dover International Speedway before last weekend's Sprint Cup race.\nAdChoices NASCAR determined that Truex's team adjusted the car illegally after going through pre-race inspection. The car's right rear quarter panel was found to be bowed out.\nAfter the discovery, NASCAR placed Truex at the rear of the field for the start of the race. But Truex worked his way up to an 11th-place finish and advanced to the next round in the Chase for the Sprint Cup.\nInitially, NASCAR said there would be no additional penalties, but after learning of the pre-race tampering with the car, Pearn was hit with the probation that extends through the remainder of the season.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportsxchange.com/tsxfiles/topstories", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:25:49.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
