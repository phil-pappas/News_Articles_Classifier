I know because my email box was filled with notes from Rangers fans imploring me to petition the organization to honor the GAG Line center by retiring his No. 19.\nAnd, no disrespect to Jesper Fast, Brad Richards, Blair Betts or any of the guys who have worn that numeral since that traumatic trade with the Bruins 40 years ago this coming Nov. 2, No. 19 is Ratelle’s and nobody else’s.\nYou’re telling me there are two Billy Joel banners hanging from the rafters at the Garden but none for Jean Ratelle?\nThe Piano Man can play, but nobody has made sweeter music in that building than Gentleman Jean and no Rangers line has ever been more magical than the one with Ratelle centering Rod Gilbert and Vic Hadfield.\nI get it. This is a now society. We Boomers have had our day. If you were born after 1965 you likely have no memory of Ratelle as a Ranger; may have no knowledge of him. That is your loss and that is why it is the Rangers’ duty and should be the Rangers’ honor to inform you of Ratelle’s greatness wearing the Blueshirt.\nThere are others overlooked and overshadowed by 1994. Hadfield is one. Brad Park is another and so is Ron Greschner. And of course all of the Hall of Famers from the pre-World War II Era in which the Rangers won three Stanley Cups from 1928 to 1940. No lie! The Rangers once won three Cups in 13 years. You could look it up.\nRatelle is renowned as a private man. I have talked to several members of the Rangers’ Alumni Association who report there may have been a long-ago breach between him and the organization. If so, more’s the pity.\nIf so, it is time to put the full force of the franchise into repairing it. There was magic when Ratelle was on the ice and it would be magical to have him back on Broadway, in the spotlight, one more time.\nNot only it is time, there is no time to lose, either.\nJean Ratelle turned 75 two weeks ago.\nAgain: Best defenseman never to win the Norris: A) Park; B) Scott Stevens; C) Mark Howe?\nBy the way, did you know Park played more games as Bruin (501) than he did as a Ranger (465)? Thanks, Emile.\nAll-Time NHL No. 19s: 1. Bryan Trottier; 2. Joe Sakic; 3. Steve Yzerman; 4. Larry Robinson; 5. Ratelle.\nAlex Ovechkin Photo: Getty Images So Alex Ovechkin overslept Tuesday, missed the morning skate and of course was not allowed to play that night by Caps coach Barry Trotz in what became a 5-0 home defeat to the Sharks because, apparently, rules are rules.\nEven stupid ones.\nBecause who was actually punished here? Ovechkin? His teammates? Or the fans who paid big bucks to see the NHL’s most compelling player but instead would up hearing a lot of hoo-hah about “accountability?”\nTo tell you the truth, I’m only surprised Trotz didn’t respond by suspending Alexander Radulov and Andrei Kostitsyn.\nNo good team in the NHL can afford or rationalize losing a home game to the barren Devils. If you ask me, that is why a surprisingly uptight Alain Vigneault is not giving Antti Raanta his first start of the year Sunday afternoon at the Garden against the Devils.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:52:18.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
