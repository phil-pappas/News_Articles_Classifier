The receiver had a solid preseason, highlighted by a special-teams play in which he returned a blocked punt for a touchdown on Aug. 30.\nHe was on the doorstep of achieving his dream of making an NFL roster.\n“I was right there,” he said.\nThe next day, he was cut.\nAZCENTRAL\nCardinals XTRA app: Get the latest news, analysis, scores, more\nLike many players whose dreams are temporarily derailed, Golden found himself on a practice squad. First in Jacksonville, with the Jaguars. Then back for another stint with the Bears, who again waived him right before the season. And finally, in Arizona, where he was eventually added to the 53-man active roster for the first time, when the Cardinals promoted him in 2013.\nThe practice squad is a perilous place to reside, as other Cardinals can attest.\nRunning back Kerwynn Williams has bounced from the team’s practice squad to the active roster and back several times over the past few seasons, with one foot perpetually in the door and the other unable to kick it open.\n“It’s been a humbling experience,” Williams said, “to say the least.”\nWhen he’s on the practice squad, as he is currently, Williams and the squad’s other nine members practice with the Cardinals, but do not suit up on game days. Often, they’re tasked with running the scout team, simulating the style and moves of that week’s coming opponent.\nAZCENTRAL\nArizona Cardinals find bargains late in free agency\nBut while running backs often imitate running backs, linebackers generally imitate linebackers and so on, many times necessity forces players to fill in wherever the team has a hole that day.\n“Some guys might’ve only played offense their whole life, but we might not have enough (defensive backs), so they’re out there playing safety,” Williams said. “Or somebody on defense might have to help out on offense. It just depends on the team. Sometimes people discredit what the practice squad does, but those guys do a lot of good things to help the team.”\nThe Cardinals, under coach Bruce Arians and General Manager Steve Keim, have been known to shuffle their hand quite frequently, turning over much of the roster since coming to Arizona in 2013.\nWhen it comes to filling out the practice squad, they have a particular brand of player in mind.\n“We want somebody that loves football, that has an upside,” Arians said. “I mean, you can find a ton of guys who will come work their ass off. But you don’t want them out there playing on Sunday. They make good son-in-laws. You want an upside, but also a guy who is really into football.”\nArizona Cardinals wide receiver Brittan Golden works during practice at their training facility in Tempe on Thursday, October 22, 2015.

He was crying, and we were laughing at the same time. It was a huge blessing. You just want to say, ‘Thank you,’ because it doesn’t happen for everybody.”\nFor players such as Williams, who have glimpsed the big show and are burning for another chance, they can only hope to use that experience to their advantage.\nAZCENTRAL\nArizona Cardinals vs. Baltimore Ravens: TV, radio, stadium information\n“It does give you a little bit of perspective on what you’ve gone through,” Williams said. “You look back on that and realize how much you’ve grown. It gives you a little bit of knowledge to pass down to the younger guys, going through the same thing that you’re going through. It keeps you on the same path, grinding hard to reach your potential.”", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/70b0e8ced6e3f568b408677237badf62c3085cfb/c=0-89-1069-1514&r=183&c=0-0-180-240/local/-/media/2015/10/23/Phoenix/Phoenix/635812332583336653-Golden.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/23/Phoenix/Phoenix/635812332583336653-Golden.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e41de23cf25ba6512028bd0d230d834dcec15383/c=201-0-807-606/local/-/media/2015/10/23/Phoenix/Phoenix/635812271839537128-PicMonkey-Collage.jpg", "http://admin.brightcove.com/js/BrightcoveExperiences.js", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b2e9b23cd767d8a10443c055f0220c24d0200e88/r=266x400/local/-/media/2015/10/23/Phoenix/Phoenix/635812332583336653-Golden.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f486957480d22f176e3cd34a46e369581131499c/c=258-0-1794-1536/local/-/media/Phoenix/None/2014/10/03/1412378318000-cards-xtra-app-promo.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5e413575ea36571d653401b80e3584104f720eeb/c=0-0-2632-2632/local/-/media/2015/10/22/Phoenix/Phoenix/635811335279797176-mnf.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:11:23.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
