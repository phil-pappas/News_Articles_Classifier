Dickey's fourth pitch of the game, Alex Rios connected an inning later against his former team and the Royals romped past the Toronto Blue Jays 14-2 Tuesday for a 3-1 lead in the American League Championship Series.

Kansas City led 5-2 in the seventh before breaking away.

I think these guys will let this one go and they'll show up to play tomorrow. ... I know these guys will be ready.\" \nAfter flashing power to build a 5-0 lead on the long ball, the Royals returned to their pesky ways late in the game against the Blue Jays' struggling bullpen. They scored nine runs with three more sacrifice flies, a barrage of slashing hits and heads-up baserunning. \n\"We're a good offensive team,\" first baseman Eric Hosmer said. \"Our park, our style of play is a little different. We like to use our legs and be athletic, but when we come to some of these parks where the fences aren't as deep we've got some guys that can put the ball in the seats.\" Kansas City Royals' Ben Zobrist, left, scores past Toronto Blue Jays relief pitcher Ryan Tepera on a sacrifice fly ball by Eric Hosmer during the seventh inning in Game 4 of baseball's American League Championship Series on Tuesday, Oct. 20, 2015, in Toronto. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum) \nBlue Jays fans had seen enough after Cain's two-run single in the eighth, turning their ever-optimistic cheers to jeers when Mark Lowe replaced Ryan Tepera. \nThe 36-year-old Chris Young bested Dickey, 40, in a bookish matchup of veteran starters — only the pairing of the Yankees' Randy Johnson and Detroit's Kenny Rogers in the 2006 ALDS tops the duo for combined age. \nBut just like his counterpart's effort in Game 4 of the Division Series against Texas, the 6-foot-10 Young was lifted one out shy of qualifying for a victory when Ned Yost went to his bullpen with a runner on first with two outs in the fifth. Yost wasn't willing to take any chances against Josh Donaldson, who already had an RBI double.

Booed all series by his old fans, he didn't get any extra satisfaction out of the hit. \n\"It's just another team we have to go out and beat,\" Rios said. \nAfter Dickey hit Escobar with a pitch — a call that needed replay review to get it right — he walked Cain one out later and was done after 1 2-3 innings.

Donaldson drove him home with a ground-rule double down the left-field line on an 83 mph slider. Jose Bautista added an RBI grounder to close the gap to 5-2 and get those white towels twirling at Rogers Centre. \nBut Luke Hochevar, Ryan Madson, Kelvin Herrera and Franklin Morales shut down the Blue Jays the rest of the way.
