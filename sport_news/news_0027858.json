Hinch ran through eight — count 'em, eight — pitchers, and Jeff Banister countered with five, and somehow it was all still knotted up going into the bottom of the ninth.\nAnd then just like that: Mitch Moreland's sacrifice fly, a 6-5 win before 26,942 at the Globe and ...\nFirst place.\nEven the Rangers can't believe it.\n\"We're not going to look at us being in first or wherever we're at right now,\" Moreland said.\n\"We're not done.\"\nNot by a long shot, they're not.\nFor a little historical perspective, the venerable Elias Sports Bureau says that only six teams since baseball went to division play in 1969 have now taken sole possession of the top spot for the first time this late in the season. And while we're at it, the Rangers are attempting to become just the fifth team in the last 40 years to win their division after trailing by at least eight games in August.\nGranted, they might not remain atop the West for long, especially with Dallas Keuchel starting for the Astros on Wednesday.\nBut given the plotline Tuesday, they won a game they simply couldn't afford to lose, leaving their newfound postseason goals firmly within reach.\nBefore we get to the finer points, let me make clear how important it was for the Rangers to win Tuesday. Going into this four-game series, they needed to win three. They can't be forced to sweep next week's three-game series in Houston. Taking three out of four against any team is a considerable task, especially if one of the three must come against Keuchel, a Cy Young favorite.\nFor that matter, they simply couldn't let the Astros off the hook Tuesday after a poor start by Collin McHugh, who gave up four runs in the first.\nBut Holland returned that gift in short order, allowing three runs in the second and two more in the fourth in a performance that in no way resembled the storyline he'd fashioned since his return.\nHe couldn't get past the bottom half of the Astros' lineup in either the first or fourth, his control a problem most of the night. Every inning brought visitors to the mound, sometimes two or more. If Steve Patterson had had as many heart-to-hearts, he might still be Texas' athletic director.\nOn another note: The Wild Thing music, courtesy of Holland's new 'do, is cute and all, but not so much when it becomes literal.\nThe best you can say of Holland's night was that he held on until two outs in the sixth, after a triple by Jose Altuve.\nBut the Astros' spark plug remained there as Houston left nine on base on the night after stranding 11 the night before.\nWhat we saw in Game 1 of this pivotal series and the budding of a full-blown intrastate rivalry at last was what we got in Game 2. No sooner did one team seize momentum than the other grabbed it back.\nThe biggest difference Tuesday over Monday was the level of grumbling over who was playing left field for the Rangers. Banister's decision to station Mike Napoli out there two days in a row nearly shut down Twitter. The reception for Joey Gallo on Tuesday was no more than the usual carping.\nFor the record: I've seen worse left fielders than Napoli, and I've yet to see a better option against left-handed pitchers.\nOther than Moreland's walk-off sac fly, the highlight of the night may have come in the fourth, when we saw Prince Fielder, who appears to have awakened from his post-All-Star slumber, score all the way from first on a double down the third-base line by Adrian Beltre. With the Rangers trailing by a run with two outs, third-base coach Tony Beasley gambled that left fielder Colby Rasmus, who'd nearly heaved a throw over the backstop in the first, might miss the cut-off man, too, and that Fielder wouldn't blow a tire on one of the switchbacks.\nAs it turned out, Rasmus did, indeed, foul up his throw to Carlos Correa, allowing Fielder to downshift before reaching home, safe and sound.\nSpeaking of Rasmus: Normally a gifted outfielder, he made a third poor throw on Moreland's liner to center in the ninth. What are the chances, you say?\nAbout the same as they were any time this summer that the Rangers would be in first place in the middle of September.\nAnd they may not be done yet.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KSherringtonDMN"], "published": "2015-09-16T08:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:57:14.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
