The Blues lost 3-1 at home to Southampton on Saturday. \nChelsea has also lost one of its first two group games in the Champions League. \nOn Sunday, Liverpool fired manager Brendan Rodgers and Dick Advocaat resigned as Sunderland manager. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T15:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:57:59.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
