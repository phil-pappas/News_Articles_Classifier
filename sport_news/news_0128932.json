(Photo: Lisa Bernheim/News Journal) \nMANSFIELD — Chioke Bradley would watch Mario Young play basketball on winter Friday nights and wonder what he could do on the football field. \nTurns out, Young could do a lot. \nIn just his first season as a high school football player, Young leads the Tygers in sacks and is second in tackles for loss. \n\"I didn't recruit him too much,\" the Mansfield Senior head football coach said. \"I basically was like, 'All your buddies are playing football, and it's your senior year. Wouldn't that be an amazing situation to finish out your senior year playing football with all your friends and doing some good and special things?'\" \nYoung finally relented. \n\"I stopped (football after seventh grade) for basketball. Chioke wanted me to play since I was a freshman, so I decided to play. I probably should have played all four (years.),\" Young said. \nOn the basketball court, Bradley saw obviously athletic skills, but he also saw an aggressiveness and a demeanor that scream football player, even if he was a 6-foot-2, 190-pound, All-Ohio guard/forward. \nThe coach knew if given a chance on the football field, Young would make the transition look easy. However, what surprised him is where Young would make his impact. \n\"I envisioned him being a dog-gone, big-time receiver because of his jumping ability and his explosiveness to go along with his physical play,\" Bradley said. \"I thought he was going to excel on that side of the ball. We tried him over there.\" \nBut Young quickly realized he'd rather hit than be hit. \n\"He kind of brought himself over here and distanced himself from the offensive side of the ball and starting showing up in a lot of our defensive drills,\" Bradley said. \nThat was fine because there was a place for him on defense. In Mansfield Senior's scheme, Bradley likes to use lighter, yet faster ends, to rush the quarterback. Young was a prototype for that position with the Tygers. \n\"As a staff, we just had to teach him a few things and let his athleticism and his physical, tough play that's instilled in him — that's in his DNA — take the rest,\" Bradley said. \"We use him as a guy that we allow to run around and make plays in the backfield. If you've got a quarterback and your wide receivers can't get open, you're going to see Mo Young shortly because we're sending him to get you.\" \nThrough six games, Young is tied for second in the area in sacks with six. He also has eight tackles for loss, one less than fellow defensive end Marvin Parker. Young has forced a fumble, and while he's not asked to be a run-stopper, he has 29 tackles, which ranks third on the squad. \nBasketball remains his No. 1 love, but he's transferring those skills to the football field. \n\"It's definitely fun,\" Young said. \nBradley wishes that fun started sooner. \n\"It's fortunate for us that he was able to come out his senior year, but I wish he would have come out three years ago,\" the coach said, \"then you never know what could happen for him. I'm glad he's here now.\" \nRob McCurdy covers high school football for the News Journal and can be reached at rmccurdy@gannett.com or 419-521-7241. On Twitter follow @McMotorsport.
