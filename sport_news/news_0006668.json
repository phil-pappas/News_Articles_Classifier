It was perhaps the most embarrassing moment of Alex McGough's career. Playing as a freshman for Florida International last season at Foreman Field, the quarterback from Tampa was about to be sacked when he awkwardly flipped a pass in the direction of running back Anthon Samuel.\nThe ball glanced off of Samuel's fingertips and into the hands of Old Dominion safety Fellonte Misher. Two plays later, ODU's Satchel Ziffer booted a field goal that gave the Monarchs a 38-35 victory.\nSaturday night, McGough more than atoned for that mistake.\nMcGough completed 31 of 39 passes 390 yards and three touchdowns and ran for another TD to lead the Panthers to a 41-12 victory over ODU at FIU Stadium.\nThe loss was the fourth in the last five games for ODU (3-4, 1-2 Conference USA), whose path to six victories and the school's first bowl bid gets narrower with each loss.\nFIU (4-4, 2-2) is zeroing in on its first bowl game since 2011.\nODU suffered what could be a major blow with 10 minutes left in the game when quarterback David Washington was sacked hard and went down awkwardly. Washington, who starred for the Monarchs in a 37-34 victory last weekend against UNC Charlotte, was on the turf for several minutes and did not put any weight on his left leg as he left the field.\nODU coach Bobby Wilder said X-rays were negative, and that team doctors think he suffered a deep bruise. But Wilder said Washington won't play next week when the Monarchs host Western Kentucky and could miss as many as three weeks.\nWilder said redshirt freshman Shuler Bentley, whom Washington replaced last weekend against Charlotte, will get the start against Western Kentucky, widely considered Conference USA's best team.\nODU outgained the Panthers 498-484, including 161 rushing yards from tailback Ray Lawry. And even though much yardage came after the game was out of hand, the Monarchs would have perhaps been competitive had they not self-destructed.\nODU committed three turnovers, failed to score four times in the red zone and suffered from poor special-teams play.\n\"We're all very frustrated,\" Wilder said. \"Our coaching staff is frustrated, our players are frustrated.\n\"That's as down as I've seen our football team after a loss.\"\nODU cut FIU's 17-6 halftime lead on a trick play to open the second half. Wide receiver Zach Pascal lined up at quarterback, took the snap from center and burst up the middle untouched for a 75-yard touchdown. Washington's two-point conversion pass attempt fell incomplete and the Monarchs trailed 17-12.\nBut ODU fell apart, committing three second-half turnovers that allowed FIU to blow the game open.\nODU dug itself into an early hole with poor special teams play, and ran out of time on a long drive in the final minutes of the first half.\nAfter moving 79 yards in 3:59, ODU had a first-and-goal at the 1 with 15 seconds left. After two Washington passes fell incomplete, ODU had a third-and-goal with five seconds left and no timeouts.\nThe Monarchs gambled that Lawry would score up the middle, but he was stacked up just short of the touchdown by defensive end Denzel Perine.\n\"If you're an underdog, playing on the road, you have to be able to pick up 1 yard,\" Wilder said.\nThe Monarchs also gave up a 56-yard return of the opening kickoff by Richard Leonard.\nThat return set up a 4-yard touchdown pass from McGough to tight end Jonnu Smith, who caught 10 passes for 183 yards and two touchdowns.\nLeonard also returned a punt 44 yards to set up a 25-yard TD drive, capped by McGough's fourth-down sneak to make it 14-0.\nODU placekicker Chris Kirtley, a freshman from nearby Ft. Lauderdale, missed a 43-yard field goal and had an extra point blocked.\nAfter cutting the lead to 14-6, ODU tried an onside kick. Had the ball been kicked far enough, the Monarchs would have recovered. Instead, kicker Ricky Segers only kicked the ball 8 yards.\n\"It was wide open,\" Wilder said of the onside kick. \"But a lot of things were open tonight and we just didn't take advantage.\n\"We were or own worst enemies.\"\nHarry Minium, 757-446-2371, harry.minium@pilotonline.com, Twitter: @harry_miniumVP \n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image.
