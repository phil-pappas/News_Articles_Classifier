Our attitude has been one of excitement. \n\"We know what's on the line. You don't have to be a rocket scientist do you. \n\"Without being disrespect in the pool rounds, it's not the same edge, it's not the same edge when you're playing Namibia. \n\"You know you're going to win the match. \n\"The edge is there this week. \n\"You can get your knife and fork out and eat it.\" \nFrance talisman Thierry Dusautoir set a World Cup record 38 tackles in that 2007 quarter-final victory, and Hansen knows the combative flanker will have a big influence again this weekend. \nSaint-Andre has dropped under-performing juggernaut centre Mathieu Bastareaud in favour of Alexandre Dumoulin to partner Wesley Fofana in midfield. \nHansen believes Dumoulin will broaden France's horizons on Saturday. \n\"Thierry Dusautoir is one of the great players of all time,\" said Hansen. \n\"If it wasn't for a certain Richie McCaw running around during that same period Dusautoir would be seen as the guy who had played the best rugby in that position over a long time. \n\"He's calculated, cool under pressure, smart rugby brain and he's a good man, good character, plays the game in the right spirit. \n\"And he's a great ambassador for French rugby. \n\"Wesley Fofana is one of their flair guys. You wouldn't want to give him much room. He'll skin you as soon as look at you. \n\"But they've all got the ability to turn nothing into something. \n\"Bastareaud is a big man, there aren't many centres that big, not even I was, except maybe a couple of weeks ago! \n\"His style is what he brings he's very confrontational, carries the ball up and gives them go-forward. \n\"They're going to look to do something subtly different with the new guy. \n\"He'll bring a different challenge and we have to respect that.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:07:12.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
