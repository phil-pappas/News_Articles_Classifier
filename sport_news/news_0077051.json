I've had several things put to me over the last few years, but it was important I returned at a club that was close to my heart and was a real challenge.\" \nChairman Brian McCaffery added: \"After a rigorous process, Mark was the outstanding candidate and the board were delighted he has agreed to return. We hope he brings stability and on-field success and helps the club achieve its ambitious goals in the months and years ahead.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:07:35.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
