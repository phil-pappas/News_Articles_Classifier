San Jose, California also lost its bid to lure the Athletics from Oakland over the objection of Major League Baseball.\nWithout comment, the high court left in place a decision by the federal appeals court in New York last year that threw out the insider trading convictions of two high-profile hedge fund managers. The federal government's pursuit of insider trading on Wall Street resulted in more than 80 arrests and 70 convictions over several years.\nJust after 10 a.m., Chief Justice John Roberts formally closed the previous term, most notable for its decision extending same-sex marriage nationwide, and began the new one.\nAs often happens, 82-year-old Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the first justice to speak in a case that involves a California woman who lost her legs in a horrific accident after she fell while attempting to board a train in Innsbruck, Austria. The issue is whether she can sue the state-owned Austrian railway in U.S. courts.\nGinsburg sounded skeptical that the lawsuit could proceed. \"There is one contact with the United States. A pass is bought from a travel agent in Massachusetts, a pass covering 30-odd railroads. That's all that happened in the United States,\" Ginsburg said during the hour-long argument.\nAll the other justices, except Clarence Thomas, eventually joined in the questioning and most seemed to agree with Ginsburg.\nConsensus almost certainly will give way to division when the court takes up cases later this term that deal with abortion, religious objections to birth control, race in college admissions and the power of public-sector unions. Cases on immigration and state restrictions on voting also could make it to the court in the next nine months.\nThe term will play out against the backdrop of the presidential campaign, in which some candidates are talking pointedly about the justices and the prospect of replacing some of them in the next few years. Four justices are in their 80s or late 70s, led by Ginsburg.\nCommentators on the left and right say the lineup of cases suggests that conservatives will win more often than they will lose over the next few months, in contrast to the liberal side's success last term in gay marriage, health care and housing discrimination, among others.\nAnd 78-year-old Justice Anthony Kennedy will continue to be the pivotal vote in many cases that split the court between its liberal and conservative blocs.\n___\nFollow Mark Sherman on Twitter at: http://www.twitter.com/shermancourt\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/shermancourt"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:03:59.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
