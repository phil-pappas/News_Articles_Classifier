She doesn’t have height, but she has the intelligence between the ears. She’s a shortstop — she catches the short hops, she can leap and get the high ones, she dives and she gets kick saves. She was just all over — she’s fabulous,” Wasatch head coach Dawain Wheatley said. \nThe Hawks came flying out with a surge of energy and pounded the ball deep into Wasatch territory early and often to create several opportunities and take control. \nThe visitors’ defense was bombarded with a deluge of shots and withstood the home team’s constant pressure as they refused to bend over the first 20 minutes. \nWasatch finally got rolling on offense and, when it finally got deep into Alta territory for the first time, made sure to capitalize off its sporadic opportunities. \nIn the 24th minute, junior midfielder Melissa Fellows sent the ball downfield, met the Hawks’ keeper at the top of the box, propitiously watched it bounce under her feet and punched in the opportune goal to take a 1-0 lead. \n“That Melissa Fellows, she just does not quit. She just gets after it with everything she’s got and is a huge part of this team. We wanted to put the ball in dangerous spots, so we got that ball in a dangerous spot, it was kind of deflected, she ran through, she was patient and tucked it away,” said Wheatley. \nAlta continued to possess the ball for the majority of the half and remained on the attack with 11 shots, compared to just one for Wasatch, in the first half. Wasatch's physical defense, anchored by its unyielding back line and Bills, however, hung tough and kept the high-octane Hawks out of the net to stay ahead at the break. \nThe Wasps’ offense came out in the second half, immediately established a rhythm and kept the ball in the home team’s territory for the majority of the first 20 minutes to give their defense a much-needed break. \nHowever, the Hawks refused to go away and came firing back with urgency and an onslaught of shots, all of which Bills batted away, to help maintain a 1-0 advantage with just 10 minutes remaining. \nThen, in the 74th minute, after its relentless attack finally wore down the defense and set up two consecutive wide-open shots right in front of the goal, Alta took aim and fired two rifles at the net before Bills held firm and came up with back-to-back miraculous saves to clinch the 1-0 shutout win. \n“I don’t even know what happened — I just made sure I hit them out of the way. I didn’t think about it; it’s all instinct and reflexes,” Bills said. “At the beginning of the game, I knew I needed to focus, just get warmed up and make sure to give it all I’ve got. And I just left everything on the field.” Ryan Love is a full-time student and has been a part-time sportswriter for Deseret News since Oct. 2012. \nFollow him on Twitter @RLove7724", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:17:18.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
