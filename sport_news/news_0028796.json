When asked about the potential of coming over the boards after a 3-on-3 overtime faceoff Sunday to create a different look, Vrbata took another playful poke at himself. \n“I would have a breakaway and with the way things are going, I would score and it would go to a (coach’s) challenge and it would be offside,” he laughed. “You’re going to see more of that stuff, some set plays and some surprising plays that coaches come up with.” \nWhat the coach came up with Tuesday is what everybody has been waiting for. The odds of Vrbata scoring Thursday against the Washington Capitals improved dramatically when he was reunited with Henrik and Daniel Sedin at practice. \nVrbata is coming off a six-shot outing Sunday against the Edmonton Oilers and with 25 shots this season, it’s not as if he’s lost a quick release — or his mind. \nHe’s missing picking corners by inches, but the confidence he exudes in playing with creative linemates is evident in how he talks with anticipation of what could be. The Sedins should be excited, too. Henrik has just one goal and an assist this season. Daniel has two goals and two assists. \n“If we play the same way we did last year, that would help big time,” said Vrbata. “You never know what to expect and that’s what makes them unique. You have to read the situation. If you go somewhere, they will adjust their play and make it work. There are not too many set plays, it’s just reading them and creating an advantage for yourself.” \nYou know the Vrbata story. Prized free agent arrives last fall and is promised the Sedins. He has three goals in his first three games, five in his first eight and the back door on those early power-play alignments was wide open to lay the foundation for a 31-goal season. \nVrbata would transition to become a stretch-drive regular with Nick Bonino and Chris Higgins, but the Sedins were always the butter for his bread. \nFast forward and Willie Desjardins’ desire to spread out scoring this season led to ABV (Anybody But Vrbata). A host of could-be or wanna-be wingers — Ronalds Kenins, Jake Virtanen, Brandon Sutter, Alex Burrows and Jannik Hansen — rode shotgun with the Sedins. \nAnd as much as Desjardins wants to roll four lines — expecting Sutter to work with Burrows and Hansen in a shutdown capacity to take pressure off Bo Horvat, so he can hit stride with Sven Baertschi and Virtanen — getting Vrbata going is crucial. \nDesjardins did it to get Sutter going after a dismal pre-season and the Sedins were the tonic. They should be for Vrbata. \n“It kind of loads up one line, but we’re at home and we get matchups (Thursday),” said Desjardins. \n“When you split them up, we’re a lot harder to defend, and when the Sedins are scoring and Vrbata is scoring, you have to look at your matchups against us. With the Sedins, you usually look for somebody who goes to the net or gives them more weight, but with Vrbata it’s a different kind of combination.” \nAt 34 and as a pending unrestricted free agent, the pressure to land a lucrative contract can only magnify the drought for Vrbata. But he doesn’t see it that way because he’s locked in the moment. \n“I would be just as frustrated if I had a 10-year contract in my back pocket — it doesn’t come into play at all,” he said. “When you know you can make a difference and aren’t, it’s not a good feeling. Everything is happening so quick, so you really don’t have time to think. You go by your instincts and you hope for the best. When you’re scoring, it just seems so easy.” \nLast season, Henrik had eight points (2-6) after six games and so did Daniel (1-7), and Vrbata had seven points (4-3). \n“He (Vrbata) is one of those guys who’s going to get to the spots and is so good at getting rebounds,” said the Canucks captain. “It’s good to put us together, but we can’t start forcing things. I talk a lot about the process and it has to be there for us to produce, and slumps for us rarely happen early in the years.” \nAdded Daniel: “We know what he (Vrbata) can do. I always look at it as if we’re getting scoring chances. That’s the only way to deal with the pressure of not scoring.” \nOF NOTE — Jared McCann centred Brandon Prust and Derek Dorsett at practice, and Desjardins is anxious to give the rookie another look. “With his speed, it’s just the way the game is going and it certainly works to your advantage,” said Desjardins. “He has played well. If we feel they (junior-eligible rookies) can’t play or are intimated, you’ve got to make a move.” \nbkuzma@theprovince.com \ntwitter.com/benkuzma «", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:50:41.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
