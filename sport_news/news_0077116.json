Fellow sophomore Shay Fields injured his left ankle in Saturday's 38-31 loss to Arizona, and his status for this week is unclear.\nThe Buffs (3-4, 0-3 Pac-12) visit Oregon State (2-4, 0-3) on Saturday night.\n\"It's a good opportunity for me to step up,\" Bobo said. \"I think any receiver would like to get a little bit more balls and get the opportunity to make more plays.\"\nFields has been one of CU's biggest playmakers on offense this season. He's caught 32 passes for a team-high 504 yards and four touchdowns. He is averaging 15.8 yards per catch.\nFields also had the best game of his career on Saturday, with eight catches for 169 yards and two touchdowns. It was on his second touchdown, a 30-yard pass from Sefo Liufau with 2:19 to play, that Fields injured his ankle.\nHead coach Mike MacIntyre said Fields didn't break anything, but was scheduled for an MRI on Monday afternoon to find out the full extent of the injury.\nAdvertisement \"Hopefully he'll be able to get back sooner than later,\" MacIntyre said.\nUntil Fields returns, the Buffs will count on others, including Nelson Spruce, Devin Ross and Bobo, to step up.\n\"Bryce had some nice plays the other night in the game, and if Shay can't go, we'll have to move some people around and more guys will get more reps,\" MacIntyre said.\nBobo has just 14 catches for 120 yards this season, but posted a career-high six catches on Saturday for 51 yards.\nIt was a nice change for Bobo, who had a slow start to the season. He caught 23 passes for 215 yards and three touchdowns in 2014, but had just four catches through the first five games this season.\n\"I don't know if the chemistry is 100 percent there between me and Sefo like it is with Spruce and Sefo and Shay and Sefo,\" Bobo said. \"I think that just comes with time. Eventually that chemistry will come and we'll make more plays together.\"\nWith Fields out, Bobo said he's running with the first-team offense, and that will help.\n\"I think that chemistry is going to come more this week just with working with him more, just being with him in practice and talking to him,\"\nBright future\nMacIntyre obviously didn't like everything he saw out of true freshmen linebackers NJ Falo and Grant Watanabe on Saturday, but saw enough to feel good about their futures.\n\"They played hard and they made some plays and gave up some big, big plays, which hurt us,\" MacIntyre said. \"I was hoping that wouldn't happen. Overall, they made some plays. They were able to make some plays and do some things and I think they both have a good future ahead of them.\"\nWatanabe played his first collegiate game, while Falo got his most extensive work, as the Buffs deal with several injuries at linebacker.\nUCLA game time set\nCU's run of night games will end next week.\nOn Monday, the Pac-12 announced CU's game at UCLA on Oct. 31 will kick off at 1 p.m. MDT (noon Pacific). It will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Network.\nThis week's game at Oregon State kicks off at 8:30 p.m. MDT and will be CU's fourth consecutive night game, the longest streak of night games in program history.\nNotable\nMacIntyre said his players all showed up on time and came in with a good attitude for Monday's meetings and practice. \"They've always responded hard and well (after a loss), and I don't see any difference,\" MacIntyre said. ... MacIntyre said he liked having Stephane Nembot at left tackle and Sam Kronshage at right tackle last week. \"That's the way we'll keep right now,\" he said. ... Linebacker Ryan Severson (right ankle) is no longer in a walking boot, but MacIntyre said the junior is still wearing an ankle brace. The Buffs hope to have him back soon.\nBrian Howell: howellb@dailycamera.com , on Twitter: @BrianHowell33.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T11:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:08:05.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
