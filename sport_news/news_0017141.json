(AP) - A federal judge is delaying a trial until Jan. 19 for a young Mississippi couple accused of attempting to join the Islamic State.\nU.S. District Judge Sharion Aycock on Friday pushed back the trial, which had been scheduled for Oct. 26.\nThe delay was sought by new lawyers for one of the defendants, 20-year-old Jaelyn Delshaun Young of Vicksburg. In a Thursday motion, they requested more time to review evidence received from prosecutors this week.\nProsecutors didn't object.\nYoung and 22-year-old Muhammad Dakhlalla of Starkville pleaded not guilty to charges of aiding terrorists. The couple were arrested Aug. 8 before boarding a flight with tickets for Istanbul. Authorities say they contacted undercover federal agents in May, seeking online help in traveling to Syria. Both are jailed pending trial.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
