NEW YORK — The bruised big apple at Citi Field got a Band-Aid.\nAdChoices A day after being hit by Travis d'Arnaud's long home run, the 4,800-pound faux fruit behind the center-field fence had two large, white strips in the shape of an \"X'' on top of it before Game 2 of the NL Championship Series.\nThe playful bandage was on there during batting practice Sunday night, then pulled off before the New York Mets hosted the Chicago Cubs.\nD'Arnaud hit the apple with a 431-foot homer as the Mets won the opener 4-2.\nThe 16-foot-tall by 18-foot diameter red apple, which rises after home runs, is much larger than the old Shea Stadium version, which was 9 feet high and weighed 582 pounds.\nThe old apple is now stationed near the home plate entrance of the new ballpark.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:50:59.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
