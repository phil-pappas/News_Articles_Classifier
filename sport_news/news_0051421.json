(USATSI) The 334th-ranked golfer on the planet is his sport's most valuable brand. What a world.\nTiger Woods came in at No. 1 on the new Forbes Fab 40 list with a 2015 brand value of $30 million. As Alex Myers of Golf Digest correctly points out , this $30 million is not a representation of how much Woods made in endorsements in 2015, but how much more he made than the average of the top 10 golfers.\nWhen you think about it that way, it's staggering. Phil Mickelson was second on the list at $28 million. Roger Federer and LeBron James were third at $27 million.\nYou know who's going to be No. 1 on this list in the near future? Not Jason Day . Not Rory McIlroy . UnderArmour's kid king, Jordan Spieth . His stable of endorsements (AT&T, Rolex, etc.) is immense and only growing.\nIt's only a matter of time.\nTopics: Jason Day , Jordan Spieth , Phil Mickelson , Rory McIlroy , Tiger Woods , GOLF", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:36:43.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
