Dickey weak at the knees. \nAnd in the 2015 regular season, no Blue Jays opponent fell victim to the vexing pitch as hard as the Kansas City Royals . \nNo wonder, then, that Jays manager John Gibbons was speaking confidently of Dickey’s prospects as starter for Tuesday’s Game 4 of the American League Championship series and the right-handed veteran’s ability to get hitters “out of whack.” \nThe final regular-season meeting with the Royals was not only one of Dickey’s best effort of the season, it was a massive turning point for the Jays, the first of an 11-game winning streak that took them from a .500 team to the class of the American League East. \n“One thing, doesn’t matter who he’s facing, when he’s on, he’s going to be tough,” Gibbons said of Dickey prior to Monday’s Game 3 of the best-of-seven series. “You don’t see knuckleballers, you know — and it can throw you out of whack.” \nSuffice to say the Royals saw enough of Dickey that day back on Aug. 2 in a game that was also marked by a bench-clearing brawl and plenty of he-said, he-said afterwards. \nOn the mound, Dickey was brilliant, however, allowing just two hits and striking out six Royals batters in seven shutout innings of the 5-3 Jays victory. A Kansas City team renowned for singling and doubling opponents to death had no answer for Dickey’s dipsy doodle that day. \nThe Jays are obviously hoping for more of the same on Tuesday. Dickey said the key is keeping the knuckler low, but it might surprise you to know he’s just fine if the Royals make regular contact. \n“For me, this is going to sound paradoxical, I think, but it’s important for me to always be pitching to contact with my knuckleball,” Dickey said on Monday. “And that means I need to be relentless throwing strikes with it. \n“The great thing with the knuckleball is that it can be in the strike zone and be just as effective as out of the strike zone because it moves so chaotically, so late. If I’m inducing a lot of weak contact, it’s great.” \nIn other words, a lot of weak ground outs on the slow Rogers Centre carpet would suit the Jays just fine. Unlike some fans, Dickey is also quite fine with the roof being closed as he hones his craft. \n“I like this stadium,” Dickey said. “I feel like I have good result here. Any time you can take an exponent of the equation, which is the climate in my particular case, because I don’t have to worry about rain or moisture or wind when they have the dome closed. \n“If I can get the right release point, I can be really consistent in the strike zone. Everything for me works on being able to throw strikes with a pith that’s hard to throw strikes with. That’s what makes me effective. \n“If I can do that routinely and the climate helps me with that, it’s certainly an advantage for me.” \nThe roof was open when Dickey faced the Royals, but it was hot, humid day — conditions also ideal for his signature pitch. \n“When I pitched against them last time, I really tried to attack the strike zone,” Dickey said. “And I was fortunate, because they are a swinging team. They were hitting pieces of the of the ball because it was moving well. \n“Hopefully I can repeat that.” \nWith an eye to getting the series back to Kansas City later in the week, Gibbons is hoping for something else as well. There’s nothing like having a team stymied by a knuckleballer then having to face an effective conventional pitcher the next day. \n“Hopefully win (Monday), bring him out there (Tuesday), maybe throw a little wrench,” Gibbons said. “It does change your approach. It’s shown in the past that guys that follow him the next day (in this case, Marco Estrada), there can be a little lull on the other side. \n“No guarantees, but we’ve seen a little bit of that. So (Dickey) might be the perfect guy to follow up (Monday’s starter, Marcus Stroman.)” Thank you Toronto fans!!!! Enjoy this team! They are awesome!!! Let's do it. — R.A. Dickey (@RADickey43) October 13, 2015 \nDICKEY WON’T BE BULLIED \nR.A. Dickey was calm and calculated on the mound the previous time he faced the Kansas City Royals. Post-game? Not so much. \nWhile Dickey was dicing Royals hitters on the way to seven shutout innings and allowing just two hits, things were getting ugly elsewhere. Josh Donaldson was hit by Royals starter Edinson Volquez in the first, prompting a fired-up Donaldson to visit the mound. \nDonaldson took some high inside pitches later in the game and, in the seventh, teammate Troy Tulowitzki also was hit. Jays reliever Aaron Sanchez issued some payback, plunking Alcides Escobar and was subsequently ejected in the aftermath of a bench-clearing scuffle. \n“I think they’re used to pushing people around,” Dickey said of the Royals following the 5-2 Jays win. “So when they come onto the playground and there’s a kid that is bigger than they are for a day, I think it probably pisses them off. \n“I can’t blame them. That’s part of their swagger.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:54:12.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
