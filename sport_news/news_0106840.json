Even with rain and an October chill ripping through TD Place during the important showdown, it still must have seemed like hell for the Bombers, while it had to be a slice of heaven for the RedBlacks, who scratched a 21-year itch for Ottawa football fans, clinching a playoff spot with a 27-24 win that was nowhere near as close as it sounds.\nThe last time an Ottawa CFL team played in the post-season was 1994, when the 4-14 Rough Riders qualified in what was then a 12-team league. With a 9-6 record, the RedBlacks moved into first place in the CFL East, with both Hamilton and Toronto having a game in hand.\n\"It's always sweet for me to come out against my old team and play like that,\" said Johnson, who had two interceptions and a huge third-down stop. \"I guess their plan was to go at me and they obviously failed. They should have known that it wasn't going to end up well for them.\"\nRedBlacks quarterback Henry Burris was methodical, spreading the ball around to his talented receivers, completing 34-of-42 passes for 370 yards. Chris Williams caught 10 passes for 125 yards, while Greg Ellingson snagged six for 101. Running back William Powell, in his first start, scored a couple of touchdowns, rushing 12 times for 69 yards. Kicker Chris Milo booted four field goals.\n\"It's a big deal,\" said RedBlacks coach Rick Campbell. \"Us being in our second year in the league, to get to a point where we could clinch a playoff spot, it means a lot. I also know our guys have a lot higher expectations going forward. We're not going to pat ourselves on the back. We're proud of it, but we're going to keep trying to get better and see how many wins we can get.\"\nThe RedBlacks, with a strong effort from their defence, took a 16-0 halftime lead.\nIt didn't look good on the opening kickoff when Reggie Dunn fumbled, with the ball recovered by Sergio Castillo. But Johnson made a huge stop on a Winnipeg third-and-one gamble, stuffing Cameron Marshall. The RedBlacks took the early lead when Powell caught a five-yard scoring pass from Burris for the TD.\nThe Ottawa defence came up big again when Antoine Pruneau knocked the ball away from Da'Rel Scott and Brandyn Thompson pounced on it. Ottawa again drove downfield, but settled for a 27-yard field goal by Milo, who then connected on three-pointers from 13 and 37 yards.\nThe Blue Bombers scored on the opening drive of the second half with Darvin Adams hauling in a five-yard touchdown pass from Matt Nichols, who had been largely ineffective the first half with just 34 yards on five completions.\nThe RedBlacks answered with a 22-yard field goal by Milo, set up by a Johnson pick on an ill-advised Nichols pass.\nAfter Abdul Kanneh missed a tackle allowing the Bombers to move the ball deep into Ottawa territory, he made up for it on the next play, taking the ball away from Adams in the end zone for an interception. The RedBlacks took over on their 11, but on their first offensive play, the snap went through Burris' fingers into the end zone and Ottawa gave up a safety to make it 19-9.\nJohnson snatched his second interception of the game at the Ottawa 35, taking the ball away from Troy Stoudemire in the opening minute of the fourth quarter.\nThe RedBlacks had a field goal taken away when a holding call forced them to punt. Ronnie Pfeffer hit a beauty, bouncing it out of bounds at the Winnipeg four-yard line.\nOttawa got the ball back and Powell scored his second TD of the game of the game. On the kickoff, Pfeffer booted the ball into the end zone for a single.\nWith 1:16 left, Winnipeg's Nick Moore caught a touchdown pass and with a two-point convert pass to Adams making it 27-17. With 9.6 seconds left, Clarence Denmark caught a pass in the back of the end zone, but Winnipeg's onside kick attempt failed.\nREDBLACKS STILL HAVE WORK TO DO\nDown the stretch, three games to go in the CFL regular season and the Ottawa RedBlacks are happy with their results so far, yet they're not totally satisfied.\n\"It could have always been better,\" said RedBlacks GM Marcel Desjardins. \"There are a couple of should-haves that would have put us in a better place. For Year 2, we're happy, but there's still work to do.\"\nSo what's gone right and what's gone wrong?\nSaid Desjardins: \"There was no doubt our offence was going to be better (than a year ago), but is it a nice surprise that it's clicking as well as it has? Yes. That's been a pleasant surprise. Disappointments? Our special teams and our kicking game - those are the two big ones.\"\nOn offence, the RedBlacks have been relatively healthy, but there have been some big losses on D.\n\"People don't understand, look at our defence,\" said Desjardins. \"We lost our starting free safety (Jermaine Robinson), we lost a starting D tackle for the year, Jonathan Williams, and whether it be Travis Brown or Malik Jackson (at linebacker), the middle of our defence has really been impacted by injuries.\"\nDesjardins discussed some of the late-season additions who haven't seen much action yet:\nNick Rosamonda: \"We felt we needed more depth at linebacker after Malik Jackson went down. But he's a player that was brought in primarily for special teams purposes.\"\nQuinn Backus: \"He's a linebacker, more of an undersized-type guy who may not get on the roster this year, but he's someone we like and hope to see develop into next year.\"\nSimone Legare: \"We liked him in the draft a copule of years ago. He's been hurt. You can never have enough depth there (at offensive line). He's a player we'll have back for camp next year.\"\nJonathan Beaulieu-Richard: \"He's a Canadian linebacker body type for special teams. He's acquitted himself quite well since he's been here.\"\nTwitter: @ TimCBaines\nBaines\nRedBlacks clinch first playoff spot in 21 years\nSTORY PRESENTED BY Real Sports Bar & Grill Sponsored By Tim Baines , Ottawa Sun First posted: Friday, October 16, 2015 10:55 PM EDT | Updated: Friday, October 16, 2015 11:50 PM EDT\nBefore Friday's game against the Winnipeg Blue Bombers, Ottawa RedBlacks defensive back Jovon Johnson vowed to make his former team's lives a \"living hell.\"\nMission accomplished.
