The fact that with using different players the team continues to win is very positive. Not just for the results and the fact we remain unbeaten, but to reinforce the group knowing we can suffer and work hard.\"\nMadrid and Sevilla were both scheduled to play on Saturday after daunting trips away in Champions League action on Wednesday, whilst Barcelona and Valencia are in action on Sunday having played their Champions League clashes on Tuesday.\nAnd Benitez called on the league authorities to help the Spanish sides in Europe more.\n\"It was a surprise for us to play on Saturday just two and half days later.\n\"Today we had to play, Sevilla had to play. I am convinced on other weeks the same will happen with other teams. When there is a European game there is little room for error.\"\nMadrid once again had goalkeeper Keylor Navas to thank in large part for the win as he continued his stellar season since a proposed move to Manchester United fell through to deny Celta in spectacular style three times before half-time.\n\"We have to congratulate him because he stopped three of four clear goals which I don't know how he saved,\" Nolito told Canal Plus.\n\"I am satisfied with the work of the team with 10 men. The sending-off was a shame but the team did everything even to get it back to 2-1.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:48:22.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
