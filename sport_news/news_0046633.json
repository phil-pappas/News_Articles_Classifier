The Kings have now played overtime (by design or coincidence) in four of their five exhibition games.\n“I think it helps if you have the guys you’re going to use during the regular season dressed and playing,’’ Sutter said. “It’s helped us get some fundamental what-we-want-to-do work in place. I’ve seen where it’s going to be really successful. If we can stick to it (the fundamentals).’’\nThe Kings have had sufficient 3-on-3 practice, but nobody has yet to test the challenge system, in which coaches will be able to ask for video review on goals that potentially involve offsides or goalie interference.\nThe NHL decided not to test the challenge system in the preseason, but Sutter said he is confident that there won’t be any complications once the season starts, at least not on his end.\nSutter said the Kings’ video staff has been doing test runs during every exhibition game. A staffer will do an instant review of a play, and Sutter will be notified about whether he should challenge the call. Accuracy is critical, because like in the NFL, a team that loses a challenge will also lose its timeout.\n“We’ve talked lots with our video guys about, when we’re doing this in preseason, it’s not a trial run,’’ Sutter said. “Get it right. If you think it’s offside, tell us it’s offside.’’\nSutter will make the necessary changes, even though they run somewhat counter to his nature.\nA forward as an NHL player in the 1980s, Sutter described himself as “pro-goal’’ and has long said that when the puck goes in the net, referees should lean toward allowing it, then go to video review if necessary.\n“My preference is that if it is a goal, count it,’’ Sutter said. “Why are we trying to take goals away? We went to one extreme, where you couldn’t even have your foot in the crease to score a goal, and then the other extreme where you’re allowed to run goalies. There has to be something in there that allows you to score.’’\nKINGS LOSE IN OT\nCorey Perry scored his second goal of the game, 43 seconds into overtime, as the Ducks beat the Kings, 2-1, on Tuesday night at Staples Center.\nPerry knocked in his own rebound to give the Ducks a 1-0 lead 7:47 into the second period, then Kyle Clifford tied the game with 1:01 remaining in the second. Andy Andreoff’s shot from the left circle deflected off Clifford’s skate and into the net.\nThe Kings’ Jhonas Enroth and the Ducks’ Anton Khudobin each played the entire game in goal, Enroth stopped 28 of 30 shots while Khudobin stopped 31 of 32.\nMUZZIN PROGRESSING\nThe Kings played without defensemen Matt Greene and Jake Muzzin, both of whom suffered upper-body injuries in Sunday’s game at Colorado. Greene did not skate Tuesday, but Muzzin was on the ice, after the full-team morning skate, for conditioning work. The status of both players is considered day to day.\nContact the writer: rhammond@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:20:29.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
