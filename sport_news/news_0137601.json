Riley Carter Millington (BBC/PA) \nEastEnders is Riley’s first acting role, and he said: “I am extremely excited to be joining EastEnders. I can honestly say that I have now fulfilled my two biggest dreams – to be living my life as a man and to be an actor. \n“I cannot wait to really get stuck in with filming and I look forward to seeing what is in store for my character.” \nIn a statement, EastEnders executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins referenced previous storylines such as Mark Fowler’s HIV and Colin and Barry’s first gay kiss, saying that the soap has “always led the way in changing audience’s perceptions about ‘difference’. Todd Carty played Mark Fowler in EastEnders (Yui Mok/PA) \n“And we have been so careful to ensure that we cast the right actor for the part. I’ve sat in many acting workshops over the years with our casting executive Julia Crampsie and her team – but never have we been so moved by the incredible life stories and wealth of talent that we experienced over our several weeks of workshops with transgender actors. \n“The people we met showed us a strength and bravery that took our breath away – and to go through as much as they have while maintaining humour and a positive view on the world is testament to what special people we met.” The #NTA2016 is now open and you can nominate a whole host of you favourite #EastEnders stars!

I hope that the audience will take Riley and his character to their hearts as quickly as everyone here at EastEnders has done.” Reblog", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:45:52.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
