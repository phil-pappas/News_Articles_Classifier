Comment By Submitted to Messenger Post Wayne Post By Submitted to Messenger Post Posted Oct. 20, 2015 at 4:34 PM By Submitted to Messenger Post Posted Oct. 20, 2015 at 4:34 PM Canandaigua, N.Y. The Genesee Valley Harriers Running Club’s Mudslog 12K and 2K Kids race is Sunday at JLD Equine property, 1942 Turk Hill Road in Perinton. The 12K race begins at 10 a.m. and the 2K race starts at noon. The 12K race is part of the #TrailsRoc Trail Runner of the Year series. “Our ultimate goal for both events is for participants to have as much fun as possible on two feet,” said Dave Bischoff, Race Director with the Genesee Valley Harriers. “Born out of a love for cross-country, trails, hills and mud, we’ve designed both races to be destination events for those who love challenges by providing plenty of obstacles to overcome.” Races will feature multiple climbs, great vistas, single-track trails including a number on the famous Crescent Trail system, running through and around farm fields, corn fields, forests, creeks, ponds, obstacles, and more. They will challenge runners’ stamina, courage, and spirit. For the kids, the 2k race will provide plenty of challenge and stimulation. Importantly, both races are designed to provide fun in abundance to participants. “ The runners will be treated to top-notch post-race party offerings. The first 250 registered runners will also receive a unique giveaway. Exciting awards will be up for grabs to the hearty competitors,” said Co-Race Director Ron Heerkens, Jr. “Proceeds will Benefit GVH, Crescent Trail Association, and Perinton Pride. GVH is committed to the development of running in our beautiful area of the world and to the support and sponsorship of national class athletes at all ages.” Registration is $40 for the 12K race and $10 for the 2K race. Both mail-in and online registration options are available. For more information about the races, registration and packet pickup, go towww.gvh.net/mudslogxc .
