AUGUSTINE (7-0, 2-0) AT NEASE (5-2, 2-0 DISTRICT 4-6A) \nIt’s felt like forever since a game in this series has felt of some significance. The Yellow Jackets will win the 4-6A title, which would be their 12th in a row, with a victory. Nease has shown substantial improvement in coach Tim Krause’s second season. QB Leighton Alley is more confident and the Panthers defense has done a 180. But St. Augustine is balanced everywhere and hasn’t lost a game in this series since 2007. Englewood and White are also in playoff contention in 4-6A. \nPARKER (3-4, 1-1) AT BISHOP KENNY (3-4, 1-1, DISTRICT 4-5A \nThe Braves squandered a prime opportunity last week against Westside. Had Parker won, the Braves could have afforded a split over their next two games. Instead, there’s one playoff spot left behind Ponte Vedra, and the winner in this one will get it. Parker can still win the district title with victories this week and next. The Crusaders have been hit with injuries and have slipped defensively, but they know how to win when they have to. Kenny hasn’t missed the state playoffs since 2008. \nFIRST COAST (2-5, 1-1) AT ATLANTIC COAST (4-4, 1-2, DISTRICT 2-7A) \nThe Buccaneers kept their playoff hopes alive last week with an OT win over Lee. They have no ground game to speak of, so moving the ball rests firmly on QB Jevaro Hardy, and big-time WR Kevin Stepherson. First Coast’s defense is still a nasty unit. Can RB Damon Williams and QB Ashton Gonzales move the ball on the Buccaneers? While Columbia is the district favorite, the spot behind the Tigers is wide-open. One two-loss team in this district is almost guaranteed to make the playoffs. \nCOLUMBIA (6-1, 2-0) AT FLETCHER (5-2, 1-1, DISTRICT 2-7A) \nThis matchup is the night’s other big domino in 2-7A. A Tigers victory will lock up a playoff berth. A Senators win would set the table for Fletcher to win the district title outright next Thursday at Lee. Which Columbia team will show up in Neptune Beach, the one that beat Bolles by 29, or the one that needed every ounce of resilience to hold off Atlantic Coast last week? It’s Week 9 and all five teams in this district have a shot at the postseason.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:18:43.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
