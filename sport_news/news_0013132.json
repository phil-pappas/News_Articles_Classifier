They ended poorly, too. In the middle of the game, the embattled Trojans got a healthy dose of hope, but that all came to naught in the fourth quarter, when their defense proved unable to stop Notre Dame —and their offense committed a key turnover.\nUltimately, Saturday will be remembered for USC athletic director Pat Haden’s pregame collapse (word out of the school is he's fine*) and the Trojans’ late-game crumbling, which resulted in a 41–31 Notre Dame win. The Fighting Irish (6–1), meanwhile, escaped falling to college football’s dumpster fire du jour of a program.\n*After the game, USC announced Haden \"took a knee\" before the game, felt lightheaded, left to stop at a local hospital and then took a private plane back.\nHere are three takeaways from the game.\n1. Notre Dame’s offense is the epitome of balanced, but maybe it should rely more on tailback C.J. Prosise .\nWith a converted slot receiver at running back and a redshirt freshman who expected to be buried as a third-stringer on the depth chart at quarterback, Notre Dame continues to put together a formidable offensive attack with an element of balance few teams are able to achieve. Going into Saturday night, the Fighting Irish had a 1.11:1 passing yards to rushing yards ratio, and against USC they finished with 262 yards in the air and 214 on the ground. Still, as the game ground on, it begged questioning: Why not more lean more heavily on Prosise?\nCollege Football Video Finish for the ages: Michigan State stuns Michigan on unbelievable play by Michael Rosenberg", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@JoanNiesen"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:55:41.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
