Most of the funding will come from Special Purpose Local Option Sales Tax funding that was initially approved by voters in 2006. At that time, the budget for the center was $13.4 million.\nSince then, the property at Hall Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard that was originally purchased for the center, at a cost of $1 million in 2007, was deemed too small, and the city has moved the site for the center to city-owned land at the corner Oglethorpe Avenue and Montgomery Street.\nMeanwhile, the budget for the arts center has ballooned to nearly $25 million. A design is still waiting for approval, and the center isn’t expected to be completed until 2017 at the earliest. The result will be a building that took 17 years to complete at a budget double of what was originally proposed and will be insufficient according to two experts who should know: the Savannah Music Festival’s Rob Gibson and the Telfair Museums’ Lisa Grove.\nAs a result of all this rigmarole, the city came up with a financial plan to bridge the gap between proposed cost and available funding. It’s a plan that makes some whimsical assumptions. One assumption is that the city will sell the Hall Street site for the $1 million it paid for the property. It’s been on the market since 2009.\nThe second assumption is that the city will collect another $500,000 from the sale of a piece of property on the project site along Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.\nBut perhaps the most fanciful part of the plan relies on each alderman forgoing $100,000 out of $1.5 million each was to receive from current SPLOST dollars for district neighborhood projects, a proposal the alderman have not signed off on nor appear in any hurry to do so, especially in an election year.\nAnd regarding the “completed” design phase, the Historic Review Board has approved the mass and height of the center. The actual design elements still have to go before the council.\nWe support and appreciate the city’s effort to address citizens’ questions and concerns on the city website — and we await the date that residents can conveniently pay their water bills online, and give these payments the same priority as paying parking tickets and red-light violation fines — but the timing is troubling and the accuracy leaves much to be desired. And based on the cultural arts center page, it’s not “spin” free.
