LESSER/EPA Falcons running back Devonta Freeman breaks out in 2015. But can he keep it up long term? When a running back is mentioned in the same breath as LaDainian Tomlinson, you know he's done something spectacular.\nYou didn't want to put too much stock in Devonta Freeman's breakout performance in Week 3 against the Cowboys because it was a massive outlier compared to his young career up until that point. Three rushing touchdowns, 141 yards rushing, plus five catches for 52 yards? The second-year Falcon never came close to such numbers in a game during his rookie season, in which he had double-digit touches just once and had two total touchdowns.\nThen he did it again. Three more rushing touchdowns, 68 yards rushing, and five catches for 81 yards against the Texans amid a blowout during which he was rested for roughly the last quarter-and-a-half. This eye-opening nugget emerged: Freeman became the first player since Tomlinson in 2005 to rush for at least seven touchdowns over the first four games — Freeman had a touchdown in Week 2 against the Giants.\nOf course, two good games obviously doesn't mean he'll have a bronze bust in Canton. Tomlinson was a fifth overall pick and dynamite from the moment he stepped onto an NFL field. Freeman was a fourth-rounder who did basically nothing as a rookie and entered the season expected to be in a timeshare with rookie Tevin Coleman, but Coleman's ribs injury opened the door for Freeman to get a full workload the last two games.\nSo what are we to make of Freeman? Is he a new fantasy darling? A flash in the pan? Something in between?\nThe biggest concern I have is how a healthy Coleman affects the number of touches Freeman sees every week. In today's NFL, the three-down back is close to extinction. Most teams possess two, and in some cases three running backs they design plays for to keep everyone fresh and protect against injury.\nWorking in Freeman's favor is he also made a big impact in the passing game the last two weeks. That passing attack also helps considerably. Defensive coordinators are losing sleep at night trying to game plan for Julio Jones. A balanced attack benefits everyone.\nUltimately, it's hard to foresee many more, if any more, three-touchdown performances from Freeman. But it's reasonable to expect him to be a top-10 running back from here on out, and he's certainly someone you have to start in your lineup every week if you have him.\n***\nThree weekly value options we like for Week 5\nRB Todd Gurley, Rams\nHe won't be cheap for much longer after he put the NFL on notice with his 106 fourth-quarter yards on Sunday. Take advantage of his price while you can.\nTE Charles Clay, Bills\nComing off two nice efforts and has a good matchup against the Titans. Will be leaned on again if Sammy Watkins (calf) remains out.\nWR Willie Snead, Saints\nEmerging as New Orleans' No. 2 wide receiver and can be had for next to nothing this week.\nDraftKings Lineup ($50,000 cap)\nQB Tom Brady, NE $7,800\nRB Le'Veon Bell, PIT $8,500\nRB Justin Forsett, BAL $5,800\nChristian Petersen/Getty Images Rams running back Todd Gurley is another guy to get on your team while you still can.
