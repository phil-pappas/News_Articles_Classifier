The last few years Jay Tyler, who broke most of Peyton's passing records, kept the QB lineage intact. Now the next in-line, Miles Lapeyere, is blazing his own trail at Lupin Field. The junior has thrown for 998 yards and 15 touchdowns in only four games this season.\n\"I think it's his maturity, I think it's his presence, \" said Newman head football coach Nelson Stewart. \"The way he handles pressure situations. We have a lot of guys that can throw their ways out of it, he's been able to run out of it this year. With Miles you hear all the time, Well he's a Newman quarterback, he's just a guy that's going to have success. It's just not success with his record, 73 percent completion percentage, matching Jay's record.\"\n\"The names in the past, obviously Peyton and Eli, but also guys like Jay Tyler, terrific quarterbacks in the past. It's not easy to get a starting role at a lot of schools, it's something you have to work for, and it means a lot, \" said Miles Lapeyre.\nLast year Newman lost to Riverside 55-14. This year the Rebels are one of the top teams in the state. The Greenies know they're in for a Herculean task, but they're ready.\n\"We were just caught out of alignment. Errant throws, terms of not lining up correctly. In that environment we played tight. That's a challenge for our kids, and you can't play tight. I think they learned from last year. It's not about the emotions, it's about the preparation, and that how we are approaching this,\" Stewart said.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
