He previously ranked No. 73 in the nation . \nAll but $10,000 of his 2015 guaranteed salary is classified as school pay in the database, which defines the term as “base salary and other income from contract provisions paid or guaranteed by the school or affiliated organizations.” Leonte Carroo \"blessed\" to be back with Rutgers, points to character \nThe closest coach to Flood in salary within the Big Ten is Indiana’s Kevin Wilson, who will earn $1.31 million in his fifth season. The only FBS coach between Flood and Wilson is Syracuse’s Scott Shafer at $1.30 million. \nFlood was the 15th-highest paid Rutgers employee in 2014, according to Gannett New Jersey's DataUniverse . Rutgers New Jersey Medical School employees occupy most of the top spots. \nRutgers women's basketball coach C. Vivian Stringer grossed $1.6 million including deferred compensation to rank third among all state employees, and Rutgers men's basketball coach Eddie Jordan earned $1.1 million to rank 13th at Rutgers. \nThe average compensation package for a FBS coach is slightly more than $2 million, up by nearly $200,000 since last season and by more than 110 percent since 2006, according to USA Today. The figures do not include the 10 schools who moved up to FBS in the last two years. Do Kevin Sumlin and Texas A&M want more money? #Yessir! \nBig Ten coaches do better financially than almost everyone else, with the average salary in 2015 at $3.21 million for the 13 head coaches. \nSalary information for Illinois interim head coach Bill Cubit was omitted from that average, as well as in measuring Flood’s standing. \nCubit, a former Rutgers assistant under Greg Schiano, reportedly received a $400,000 raise when he was promoted from offensive coordinator after Tim Beckman’s firing in late August and now will earn $916,010. \nThe Big Ten is responsible for two of the three highest-paid coaches in the nation, as Michigan’s Jim Harbaugh ($7 million) and Ohio State’s Urban Meyer ($5.86 million) trail only Alabama’s Nick Saban ($7.08 million). Penn State’s James Franklin ($4.4 million) is No. 8 nationally. Jeff Towers: Rutgers boosters firmly behind Kyle Flood \nIowa’s Kirk Ferentz ($4.07 million) and Michigan State’s Mark Dantonio ($3.67 million) are next in the Big Ten. Six of the league’s schools – Nebraska, Minnesota Northwestern, Wisconsin, Purdue and Maryland – have coaches who will earn between $2.7 and $2.1 million. \nFlood’s salary does not account for the $50,000 fine he received from Rutgers, along with a three-game suspension , for impermissible contact with a faculty member. Flood was suspended with pay as he is still running the program on non-gamedays, though wins and losses still count toward his career record (25-18). College football coaches piling up more cash through bonuses \nA member of Rutgers coaching staff since 2005, Flood’s contract includes a maximum of $425,000 in on-field bonuses, which puts him No. 69 among the 109 FBS head coaches in the nation collecting bonuses, per the database. Only California’s Sonny Dykes is eligible for less among the Power Five. \nAt the high end of the bonus structure is Arizona State’s Todd Graham, who can earn an additional $3.74 million on top of his $3 million pay. Ferentz’s $2.37 million maximum bonus leads the Big Ten. \nFlood cashed in $85,000 in four bonus payments last season, including $25,000 for a multi-year APR score of 950 or higher, $25,000 for a team average cumulative GPA of 2.6 or higher, $25,000 for a non-College Football Playoff bowl appearance and $10,000 for a non-CFP bowl win. \nThat amount ranked No. 40 in the nation, according to USA Today. Missouri's Gary Pinkel led the nation with $900,000 in bonuses earned. \nInformation was not available for seven FBS schools, including four (Pittsburgh, Wake Forest, Southern California and Vanderbilt) in the Power Five. \nStaff Writer Ryan Dunleavy: rdunleavy@gannettnj.com 59 CONNECT 10 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1Rw4J6a TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:35:45.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
