Mitch Stringer Oct 14, 2015 at 3:17p ET 0Shares \nBEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Browns starting quarterback Josh McCown is practicing on a sore left ankle he injured in the closing minutes of a record-setting performance at Baltimore. \nMcCown got hurt when his ankle was rolled up on during overtime Sunday. Browns coach Mike Pettine said McCown is sore, but the 36-year-old will \"be out there\" at practice Wednesday as the Browns prepare to host the Denver Broncos, who have the NFL's top-ranked defense. \nPettine said the Browns may scale back McCown's number of snaps in practice. \nMcCown passed for a franchise regular-season record 457 yards and two touchdowns in Cleveland's 33-30 win. He also ran for a score, threw for a 2-point conversion and helped Cleveland win in Baltimore for the first time since 2007.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:30:00.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
