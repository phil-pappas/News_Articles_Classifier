It doesn't help getting psyched up Wednesday - you lose energy like that. \n\"It's all about being ready to take them on when the game starts. \n\"They are a quality side but we have come close against them a few times and beat them last year. We have a lot of belief. \n\"One moment could win or lose it for us. We can't give them soft moments. \n\"It is all about pressure for 80 minutes and not giving them anything. \n\"I would be able to start if Lood were not ready for any reason. It would be a great honour.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:19:02.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
