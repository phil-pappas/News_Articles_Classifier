Three weeks after the U.S. round of the World Championship, Young Driver AMR is back in action, this time in Japan. The sixth round of the championship will take place this weekend at Fuji Speedway in Japan. Christoffer Nygaard and Marco Sørensen will chase their first podium finish of the season in their Aston Martin Racing entered Young Driver AMR-Aston Martin in the second-to-last round of the season. Young Driver AMR travels with good memories to Japan: In the past two years, the team took class victories there in the GTE-AM-class. But after the switch to the GTE Pro class this season, the competition will be tougher at the track located in the shadows of the scenic Mount Fuji. The past two rounds at Nürburgring and Austin/Texas have been tough ones for Young Driver AMR, after a performance cut by the organisers post the 24 hours of Le Mans. However, there is hope as the Aston Martin Vantage GTE was given a performance break and is allowed slightly more power for the six-hour race at the quick track in Japan. The last two races were frustrating for us as we couldnt race with our competitors on a equal level, says Jan Struve of Young Driver AMR ahead of the race in Japan. Still, with good teamwork we made the most of this situation, even if we were denied a chance to fight for a podium finish. For the upcoming rounds we received a performance break that will bring us closer to our competitors. We will be closer to them, but most likely not on the same level. We will give our best, not at least as fans in Japan are second to non und always give us a very warm welcome. The 6 hours of Fuji start Sunday at 04:00 hours CET (11:00 hours local time). Eurosport will broadcast the entire race live, while a paid livestream is available at the series website www.fiawec.com.
