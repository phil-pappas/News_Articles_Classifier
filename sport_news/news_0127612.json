I think it's wrong to beseech him and call on him to meet. \"\nBennett added: \"The world is longing for a clear statement by the State of Israel that Abbas isn't a partner, and that Israel objects to a Palestinian state. Abu Mazen is a terrorist, one shouldn't talk with him.\"\nOn Thursday, Netanyahu said that he is \" completely open \" to meeting Abbas and other Arab leaders. \"I think it is potentially useful because it might stop the wave of incitement,\" he said during a press conference at the Foreign Ministry.\nHis comments also came after Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Wednesday accused Israel of executing 13-year-old Ahmed Manasra, who stabbed two Israelis, even though he was still alive .\nNetanyahu blasted the Palestinian president's comments as lies and said that \"the current campaign [of terror attacks] is the result of Palestinian incitement,\" he said, claiming \"President Abbas continues to incite and lie.\"\nBarak Ravid\nHaaretz Correspondent\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/barak.ravid.75?fref=ts", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js", "http://twitter.com/#!/BarakRavid"], "published": "2015-10-18T05:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:26:52.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
