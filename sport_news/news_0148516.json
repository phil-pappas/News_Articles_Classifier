He practiced fully on Thursday and Friday last week, but after being limited Saturday, he missed Week 4. Now, after being limited Wednesday and sitting Thursday, there's a chance he'll miss another game.\nIn addition to Warford, Lions defensive tackle Haloti Ngata (calf) missed practice Thursday, and after the Lions signed another defensive tackle Thursday, Ishmaa'ily Kitchen, there's reason to think he's in danger of sitting.\nLinebacker Travis Lewis (ankle), running back Joique Bell (ankle) and tight end Eric Ebron (knee) were also out.\nThe Lions will release an injury report later Thursday listing the players who were limited.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T18:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:20:59.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
