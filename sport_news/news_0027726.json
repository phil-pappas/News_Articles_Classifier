Valentino Green grabbed a 27-yard touchdown pass from Jared Eivins, and the J-Hawk attack was off and running. \nA 63-yard keeper by Eivens set up Valentine’s 10-yard scoring run to cap off a two-play series. Still another big play, a 67-yard Eivins to Mason Short pass, moved Jefferson into the red zone. From there, Short scored on a 1-yard run and it was 22-0. \nEivins, who played essentially just one quarter, concluded the 12-minute flurry with a 3-yard TD strike to Jalyn Stafford. That drive began with a fair catch interference flag that moved the J-Hawks to the Trojan 32. \nOverall, Eivins threw for 103 yards and rushed for 69. Short had two receptions for 123 yards and the two TDs. \nEast did not reach Jefferson territory until the final series of the half. That drive reached the J-Hawk 40 before a pair of quarterback sacks threw the Trojans back into their own territory as time expired. \nEast turned the ball over three times in the opening 24 minutes. \nOverall, Jefferson outgained East 381-23 while building a 43-0 lead at the break. \nThe Trojans, playing with several key starters sidelined by injury, got on the board in the fourth quarter. Nathan Heinz booted a 24-yard field goal. \nEast dropped to 0-8 overall while Jefferson is now 5-3. \n— Jim Sullivan, Waterloo Courier \nANAMOSA 35, UNION 0 — Kolin Schulte rushed for 175 yards and four touchdowns as the Raiders improved to 8-0 for the first time since 1947. \nSchulte, who carried the ball just 15 times, scored on runs of 3, 2. 58 and 72 yards. Daniel Husmann scored on a 54-yard run for Anamosa’s other TD and Trevor Wehling added 127 yards on 13 rushes. \nThe Raiders finished with 453 yards of offense, holding Union to 139. \n— Daryl Schepanski, correspondent \nCHARLES CITY 28, DECORAH 7 — Drew Mitchell passed for two touchdowns and ran for two more as the Comets took advantage of four Decorah turnovers to snap the Vikings’ four-game winning streak. \nCharles City (3-5, 1-4 in 3A-3) scored 14 points off those turnovers, \nDecorah (4-4, 3-2) outgained Charles City 272-247, but the Vikings were only 1 of 4 in the red zone. Charles City was 3-for-3 in the red zone. \nZach Lea scored Decorah’s only TD on a 4-yard run in the second quarter. \n— Darin Svenson, correspondent \nTIPTON 27, MONTICELLO 23 — Koby Johnston rushed 33 times for 223 yards and two touchdowns, including a game-winning 3-yard run with 35.3 seconds left, as the Tigers won at Monticello. \nQuarterback Adam Hermsen added 126 rushing yards for Tipton (7-1, 4-1 in 2A-4). \nJacob Manternach passed for 248 yards and two TDs for Monticello (3-5, 1-4), Tyler McDonald caught six of those for 130 yards and Max Keleher rushed for 115 yards. \n— Pete Temple, correspondent \nDYERSVILLE BECKMAN 21, NEW HAMPTON 13 — Tyler Hirsch scored a 55-yard touchdown run to break a 7-7 tie as the Blazers (5-3, 4-1) held on to beat the Chickasaws in a Class 2A District 3 contest. \nJake Grover tossed a 15-yard touchdown to Sam Stelken for Beckman. \nAlex Troyna threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Trevor Ambrose for New Hampton (4-4, 3-2). \nSOLON 37, WESTERN DUBUQUE 7 — Brandon Childs scored two touchdowns and completed 8 of 15 passes for 89 yards for the Spartans. \nThe Solon (4-4, 3-2 3A-4) defense held the Bobcats to 42 rushing yards, led by Spencer Lawson with six solo tackles and Dillon Diltz with four. \nJacob Coons returned a blocked punt 37 yards for a score. \nSPRINGVILLE 36, WEST CENTRAL 22 — Henry Hoogland had 224 rushing yards and one touchdown as the Orioles (4-5, 3-3) beat West Central (3-6, 2-4) in 8-player District 4. \nJacob Loehr threw for 75 yards with two touchdowns and Seth Blake ran for 79 yards and two touchdowns. \nDUBUQUE WAHLERT 35, MARION 8 — Gage Kray caught eight passes for 113 yards and a touchdown, but there were few other bright spots for Marion in a 35-8 loss to Dubuque Wahlert at the Loras College Rock Bowl. \nWahlert’s Rian Weber returned an Isaak Hahn interception 98 yards for a touchdown for a 14-0 lead with 10:05 to play in the second quarter. A blocked punt set up the Golden Eagles (3-5, 3-2 3A-4) inside the Marion 10 for another score to make it 21-0 before halftime. \n“The biggest thing is we have nobody left,” Marion Coach Tony Perkins said. “We started the game missing 11 players. We finished it missing 19.” \n— Steve Ortman, Dubuque Telegraph-Herald", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:07:11.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
