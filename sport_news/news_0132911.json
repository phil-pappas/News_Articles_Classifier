He teamed with senior cornerback Jaylon Delgado and junior cornerback Kevin Johnson to bat numerous passes down throughout the game.\nSenior linebacker Kaleb Friedman led the team in tackles. On offense, senior running back Elijah Smoot paced the Rattlers with 82 rushing yards and a touchdown.\nBackup junior quarterback Taiwan Braden was pressed into action and responded admirably with 123 yards and a touchdown on 5-for-12 passing. The touchdown pass went for 62 yards to senior receiver Jesse James.\n“It was a great victory for us,” Joe Delgado said. “We started strong and it helped our confidence level throughout the game.”\nCase Keefer 948-2790 or case.keefer@lasvegassun.com .
