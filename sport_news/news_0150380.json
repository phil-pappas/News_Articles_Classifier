The Boston Bruins, who had to play without injured No. 1 defenseman Zdeno Chara, seemed intent on making both their captain and their coach proud early in Thursday`s 2015-16 opener at TD Garden. They lost their way, and the game, in the second period. The Bruins, who used a faster-paced, puck-possession style installed by coach Claude Julien to dominate the first period and take a 1-0 lead, got far too sloppy for a stretch of the middle period and gave up too much ground to recover. The Winnipeg Jets — a team the Bruins had beaten 13 straight times at TD Garden — scored a 6-2 victory. The B`s were in decent shape until the new line of Matt Beleskey, David Krejci and David Pastrnak turned the puck over in neutral ice at the start of the second period, leading to an odd-man rush and a goal for Mark Scheifele at 5:26. A terrible giveaway behind the net by defenseman Matt Irwin resulted in an easy goal for former Bruin Blake Wheeler and a 2-1 Winnipeg lead at 9:17. Most damaging of all was a goal by Drew Stafford with 2:21 left in the period, after the line of Jimmy Hayes-Ryan Spooner-Brett Connolly, backed by the Irwin-Zach Trotman defense pair, spent an entire shift trapped in the defensive zone. David Pastrnak`s goal 1:25 into the third period sparked thoughts of a comeback, but the B`s quickly surrendered goals to Chris Thorburn (again, after a turnover) and Nicolas Petan before the period was 10 minutes old. Alexander Burmistrov hit an empty net with 3:38to play to close the scoring. Tuukka Rask took a 26-save loss. The most depressing aspect of the loss was that the Bruins had played such a strong, smart first period. They rarely had to worry about Chara`s absence, because they had the puck most of the time. Krejci, whose season was ruined by injuries last season (he missed 35 games, and was compromised for many of the 47 he did play) was at the center of things. He won 7-of-10 first-period face-offs, played at the point with both power play units, and scored the Bruins` first goal of the season after just 5:36. Pastrnak, Krejci`s teenage linemate, forechecked Ben Chiarot into a turnover below the Jets` goal line and sent it though Dustin Byfuglien to the front of the net. Chiarot lost it there to Krejci, who beat Ondrej Pavelec with a backhander. The Bruins went on to outshoot the Jets 12-6 in the first period, but missed out on several great chances to increase the lead. Hayes, the Dorchester and Boston College-bred winger playing in his first game as a winger, nearly had his first assist when Pavelec kicked Hayes` shot off the right wing into the slot, but Chris Kelly couldn`t settle the rebound down in the low slot with Pavelec out of position. Later, Hayes shot wide of a near-vacant net from the left circle, after Trotman drew coverage in the right circle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:55:11.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
