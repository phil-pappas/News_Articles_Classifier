He had been part of a five-man 2015 Texas A&M recruiting class ranked No. 8 nationally by Scout.com.\nAlthough it’s unclear why Mitchell chose not to follow through on his commitment to the Aggies, Memphis does have room for Mitchell on this year’s roster. The Tigers have an open scholarship with coach Josh Pastner having said this week he didn’t expect senior forward Chris Hawkins to return this season. Hawkins missed the second half of last season with a knee injury and was not cleared medically to play this year.\nMemphis already has a plethora of combo guards, including three freshmen — Jeremiah Martin, Randall Broddie and Craig Randall. The addition of Mitchell would give the Tigers more insurance in the backcourt with senior point guard Kedren Johnson potentially facing season-ending shoulder surgery, but it won’t help the Tigers’ lack of depth inside.\nPastner couldn’t be reached for comment Saturday.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/tigers?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Memphis?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/twothree_quan/status/652957903842865153", "http://t.co/dpQZK3EDuk"], "published": "2015-10-11T05:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:27:25.236+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
