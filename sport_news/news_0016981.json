His motto “win for today and develop for tomorrow” says that the Dolphins have the tools to win now and still improve over the next three years.\nMike Tannenbaum, left, Miami Dolphins executive vice president of football operations, shakes hands with former tight ends coach Dan Campbell, after announcing that Campbell was being promoted to interim head coach, Monday, Oct. 5, 2015 in Davie. (AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee) While he expected some highs and lows, he didn’t envision the plan kicking off with a 1-3 start and a coaching change four games in to the season.\nBut he remains adamant that the blueprint will work and the Dolphins can and will succeed.\n“Certainly we had hoped and expected that we’d play better which we haven’t through four games,” Tannenbaum told the Palm Beach Post. “But I do like the nucleus and I like the age of the team.\n“A lot of our nucleus, a lot of our good players are young and that’s the part that’s really exciting for me. You look at guys like Jarvis Landry, Mike Pouncey, Ja’Wuan James, Reshad Jones, Brent Grimes. There’s a lot of good players like Ryan Tannehill that are still young and I think the nucleus can be here for the foreseeable future.”\nInterim coach Dan Campbell, who joined the Dolphins in 2010 as a coaching intern and spent the next 4-plus seasons as the team’s tight ends coach, believes this team has more talent than any Dolphins team this decade.\n“This is my sixth season with the Miami Dolphins and this is the most talented roster that we have had in those six years,” Campbell said. “We have plenty of talent, We have the people in this building.”\nCampbell is trying to turn the Dolphins around with many of the same schemes that failed former coach Joe Philbin, using minor tweaks and a fresh, competitive attitude.\nWhether it works is the key question beginning Sunday in Tennessee. At 1-3 the season is not lost yet. But it could be lost soon if the Dolphins don’t turn it around.\nTannenbaum won’t give any hint as to what Campbell, 39, needs to do to keep the job beyond this season.\nDoes he need to make the playoffs, which would likely mean a 9-3 finish this season? Would a seven or eight win season be enough, which means Campbell finishes at least .500 after Philbin’s rocky start?\n“We’re going to wait on all those decisions until the end of the year,” Tannenbaum said. “We have a strong feeling for Dan. That’s why we hired him. And we’re going to do everything we can to help him win as many games as possible. And at the end of the season we’ll go from there.”\nCampbell wants to remain the guy in Miami to execute Tannenbaum’s three-year plan.\n“I’m not here just to finish the season out,” he said. “That’s not my plan.”\nBeyond this season — whether Campbell remains coach or the Dolphins go for a big splash — the Dolphins have a lot of money already committed to key players.\nDefensive tackle Ndamukong Suh this offseason signed the largest defensive contract in NFL history. As it’s currently structured, he’d cost the team a massive $28.6 million cap hit next season.\nThe Dolphins also signed quarterback Ryan Tannehill and center Mike Pouncey to extensions this offseason.\nDefensive end Olivier Vernon and running back Lamar Miller are Miami’s biggest name players heading to free agency.\nTannenbaum insists the Dolphins, who have been creative with contracts in the past, will remain competitive with the ability to lure new talent over the next couple of seasons.\n“We have a plan,” he said.\nBoth Tannenbaum and Campbell point to owner Stephen Ross as reasons why the Dolphins long-term plan for success will work.\nRoss is willing to spend whatever it takes to turn the team around. But in a salary cap league, that means investing the money wisely. And no matter how much money Ross has put in to the team, it hasn’t resulted in a playoff berth since he became majority owner in 2009.\n“He gives us every conceivable resource to be successful,” Tannenbaum said. “We have the foundation right here.”\nNow, they just have to turn Ross’ money in to wins.\nCampbell is having open competition to determine starting spots, and Tannenbaum says playing time is decided by Campbell.\nBut Tannenbaum says he is involved in day-to-day on-the-field discussions.\n“We talk about everything,” Tannenbaum said. “That’s what’s a good partnership does. (General manager) Dennis Hickey, myself, the coordinators. There’s a really good chemistry amongst everybody. And Dan’s very open minded. So we have those discussions, we make suggestions and how much they play ultimately has to be determined by the coaching staff.”", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/10/16/87/08/Dolphins-Philbin-Fired.-2-.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-16T18:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:06:46.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
