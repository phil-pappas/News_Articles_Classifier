He has done so with flying colors, and the ongoing North American stretch of his world tour is quickly approaching 200 live performances. The number is a staggering one that rivals any performer over a one-year stretch. His willingness to perform two shows in one night is something that sets him apart from many mainstream chart-toppers. Both he and Yearwood have accomplished the feat about 40 times throughout this tour, and it will certainly happen more before they actually leave the country and touch foreign soil.\nAs of now, all fans in Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri and other nearby Midwestern states should mark their calendars for performances that will unfold on the first Friday and Saturday night of December.\nA slew of reviews, pictures and other commentary have come in via social media since the Brooks tour began with a series of shows in Rosemont, Illinois in late 2014. The vast majority are overwhelmingly positive. Although his set list has amazingly been un-published from the Internet, fans were made well aware that Brooks and his wife combine for over 30 songs during a show that often traipses into the three-hour region.
