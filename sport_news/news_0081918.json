Defensively, the Wildcats recorded five sacks, as sophomore linebacker Ryan DeMattie led the way with eight tackles and a forced fumble. \nHibbler sparked the Blazers' offense with 308 passing yards and four touchdowns, while sophomore Marquis Hedge ran well for 94 yards and a touchdown. \nLC will host the 10-time defending champion University of Mary Hardin-Baylor next week at Wildcat Field.
