He called Bertrand, who stayed back in Annapolis, on Friday night to get some advice and encouragement. \n\"Kwazel has helped me every step of the way. If I need advice, I go and talk to Kwazel. The night before the Notre Dame game, I called Kwazel and we talked for about 30 minutes,\" Thomasson said. \n\"Kwazel is a great player and I look up to him. To see how hard he plays really inspires me. To see him go down is a tough situation, but that's how our system works. One guy goes down, the next guy gets up.\" \nThomasson said the jitters went away after the first series when Navy forced Notre Dame into a three-and-out. \n\"I was kind of nervous for the first two or three plays. Then I realized these guys are just like us. They put their pants on and their cleats on just like us,\" said Thomasson, who was a two-time All-Greater Neuse River Conference selection at Clayton High in North Carolina. \nBertrand was one of team's top tacklers at the time he sustained the season-ending injury and that's because the rover plays a big role in run support in Navy's system. \n\"Being a rover you're more backside and coming down for run support. It's key to look at the offensive linemen and see their blocks, look at the wide receivers and see their splits,\" Thomasson said. \"I have to be ready to fire off the ball and come downhill full-speed. It's all about wrapping up and getting the ball-carrier on the ground.\" \nOf course, the rover can look bad if he bites on play-action, comes forward in run support and abandons his pass coverage responsibilities \n\"I made a few mistakes in the Notre Dame game. I came up when I probably should have stayed back,\" Thomasson said. \"I've learned quickly that you have to read your keys perfectly.\" \nFreshman Sean Williams, who started the season opener at cornerback and acquitted himself well, has switched to safety and is now backing up Thomasson. \n\"We'll see how well Sean learns it. If he can't pick it up, we'll move him back to corner and go in another direction,\" O'Brien said. \"So far, he's done a good job of adjusting. He plays well in space. He can stick his foot in the ground and go sideline-to-sideline, which is nice.\" \nNavy has not employed a defensive alignment featuring five defensive backs very often this season, but that figures to change with the meat of the American Athletic Conference schedule coming up. Memphis, Houston, Tulsa and SMU all employ spread passing attacks that utilize four and five receiver sets. \n\"Because with our schedule coming up we're going to see a lot of speed and a lot of passing. We have to be ready to defend plays on the perimeter,\" O'Brien said. \"We're trying to get Sean and Elijah (Merchant) plenty of reps so they understand what's going on out there. We're trying to find ways to get those guys on the field if we can.\" \nREYNOLDS UPDATE: Starting quarterback Keenan Reynolds has directed the first-team offense in practice this week and is moving well, according to head coach Ken Niumatalolo. \n\"Keenan is doing well. I think he's had a good week of practice,\" Niumatalolo said. \"He looks good and hopefully he's 100 percent on Saturday. \nReynolds endorsed that assessment and reiterated that he is on target to start on Saturday versus Tulane. \n\"Today was the best I've felt running around,\" Reynolds said after practice on Wednesday. \"I'll just continue to treat it, continue to rehab it and I'll be ready to go on Saturday.\" \nReynolds was hurt against Notre Dame when 285-pound defensive lineman Isaac Rochell fell on him. By all accounts, the injury has been diagnosed as a bruised shin. \nReynolds said he has no intention of wearing a brace like he did last season after sustaining a leg injury. \n\"I'm not going back to the brace days,\" he said. \nReynolds played in three games last season when he was not 100 percent and clearly was not himself as the Midshipmen went 0-3. \n\"If I didn't think I could be full-speed I would let the coaches know,\" Reynolds said. \"I felt good running around out here this week. It's not the same as last year.\" \nReynolds is still chasing the NCAA record of 77 rushing touchowns that is held by former Wisconsin tailback Montee Ball. He has not scored a rushing touchdown in consecutive games for the first time in his career and remains stuck on 73. \nINJURY REPORT: Senior wide receiver Mark Meier suffered a season-ending knee injury in practice prior to the Air Force game. \nMeier was spotted at practice this week on crutches and wearing a brace after undergoing surgery for a torn anterior cruciate ligament. \nMeier opened preseason practice as the backup behnd Thomas Wilson at the X wide receiver spot, but was surpassed by sophomore Craig Scott and had not gotten into a game this season at the time of the injury. However, the graduate of Great Bridge High in Chesapeake, Virginia, was one of the leaders of the unit along with Wilson. \nMeier joins Bertrand and cornerback Shelley White (torn Achilles) as seniors who are likely lost for the season. White, an Annapolis native and Archbishop Spalding product, had his cast removed a couple weeks ago and is now walking in an attempt to strengthen his surgically repaired Achilles tendon and is hopeful of at least dressing for the Army-Navy game. All three seniors continue to attend practice on a daily basis to encourage their teammates and help coach their replacements. \n\"It's been really tough, but to see them all out here at practice shows you the quality and character of these kids,\" Niumatalolo said. \nSHOWDOWN: Former Navy football players Noah Copeland and John Hendrix attended practice on Tuesday and Wednesday. The 2015 graduates are helping coach the Naval Academy Prep School football team along with classmates Jordan Drake and Parrish Gaines. \nNAPS will play the Navy junior varsity on Friday (2:30 p.m.) at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium and the game is open to the public. \nTULANE @ NAVY", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:44:06.581+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
