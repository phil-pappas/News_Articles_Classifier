They will face the Blue Jays on Friday in the ALCS. \nRoyals pitcher Johnny Cueto has been throwing fire, but he also gave up a two-run home run. \nLuis Valbuena hit the home run in the second inning. Evan Gattis had managed to get on base after first baseman Eric Hosmer couldn't field a throw. He wasn't charged with an error. \nCenter fielder Lorenzo Cain scored in the bottom of the fourth on a Hosmer single. Cain kept running after he rounded second like the cheetah he says he is when he saw the Astros didn't handle the hit cleanly. \nIn the 5th, Alex Rios hit a double to left field and Royals took the lead 3-2. Next up Ben Zobrist hit a fly out, but left enough time for Rios to run across home plate, extending the Royals' lead. \nIn the 8th, the Royals extended their lead when Kendrys Morales homered on a line drive to center field, bringing in Alcides Escobar and Lorenzo Cain. \nThe Royals are asking Cueto to fulfill the role of shutdown ace in a deciding game they envisioned after they traded away three top prospects for him before this year's non-waiver trade deadline. However, the former Reds pitcher is 0-2 with a 5.52 ERA in four career playoff starts and didn't exactly carry Kansas City into the postseason after the deal with Cincinnati was made. \nManager Ned Yost said during the game that he was pleased with how Cueto is throwing, and he's been throwing fire. \nThe Royals are expected to pull Cueto at the first sign of serious trouble. The bullpen is well stocked and waiting. \nRefresh this page for updates. \nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
