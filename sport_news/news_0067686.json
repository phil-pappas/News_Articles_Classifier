What were his favorite moments against the Mets ? How could he even narrow them down? \nMore than anyone on that Phillies team from last decade, Rollins seemed to relish beating the Mets over his 15 years in Philadelphia. Remember when he proclaimed \"I think we are the team to beat in the NL East -- finally.\" And that was after the Mets had just gotten to the NLCS in 2006. \nRollins, 36, is now in L.A., an old sage with the Dodgers who struggled on the field. He seems to have lost his job to Corey Seager at shortstop after hitting .224 this season. But his first playoff series with the Dodgers will be against the Mets . So he went back to the old well to pick his favorite two moments against the Mets. 2015 NLDS PREVIEW : How Mets overcame headaches and torn UCLs to keep their pitching great \n1. \"One I remember vividly was playing at Shea Stadium and I can't remember the pitchers name – but the tall right-hander they had that threw a good changeup – and he just kept getting me, kept getting me out. It was kind of like that moment where we got to a 3-2 count, I'm like 'You know what, you fooled me too many times throwing a changeup right here. I'm going to sit on it'. He threw it. I hit a home run and that kind of started our comeback in '07.\" \n[Editor's note: Rollins later clarified it was Aaron Heilman. And after much Baseball Reference searching, he homered off Heilman on June 6, 2007. That win put the Phillies six games back in the N.L. East] \n2. \"Another moment is when I think we had a four-game set and we were down, I think, about 10 games at the time, had a four-game set against the Mets and won all four games. But the walk-off hit against Billy Wagner, Chase Utley hit the ball to right field and Tadahito (Iguchi) came around and scored and burnt (Mets catcher Paul) Lo Duca just walking off the field like 'Yes!' We got them.\" Even if we hadn't come back and won that year, we handled our business when we needed to. It just worked out that we kept winning and they kept losing.\" \n[Editor's note: The Phillies entered a four-game series at Citizens Bank Park down six games to the Mets on Aug. 27, 2007. They then swept them. The final win was an 11-10 walk-off win. Utley did in fact shoot a single off Billy Wagner to right field and Tadahito Iguchi did score.] \nMike Vorkunov may be reached at mvorkunov@njadvancemedia.com .
