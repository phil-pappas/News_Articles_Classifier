Tennessee takes on Alabama in Tuscaloosa at 3:30 Saturday. \nThe Vols have not beaten the Tide since 2006, but don't let that fool you. Despite recent struggles, Tennessee has been within a few possessions of taking down Alabama. The Vols have lost eight straight to Alabama, which is the second longest winless streak in series history. \nTennessee is coming into Saturdays game with a big win against Georgia. They have also had two weeks to prepare for the strong Alabama defense. Big orange will have to rely on the running ability of Josh Dobbs and an up tempo type offense if they have any hopes of beating Alabama.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:14:32.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
