The Owls are facing one of the nation's top kick returners in Marshall's Deandre Reaves. He is averaging 30.7 yards a return and scored one touchdown.\n\"He's a ridiculous kick returner,\" FAU coach Charlie Partridge said. \"He has two touchdowns, one of them got called back. The one that got called back was an unbelievable display of athleticism. He's pretty special.\"\nLast year, Reaves ranked seventh in the nation, averaging 29.1 yards a return. He is Marshall's all-time leader in return yardage.\nJohnson stays positive\nIt hasn't been exactly the type of season senior quarterback Jaquez Johnson envisioned. He's spent most of the year dealing with a nagging ankle injury that has slowed him.\nPartridge said Johnson has remained positive despite the struggles.\n\"To his credit, he's been great,\" Partridge said. \"He's doing everything he can. We got the best version of [Johnson] we possibly could have.\"\nA model program\nWhen it comes to building a program, the Owls can look no further than Marshall for the blueprint.\nThe Thundering Herd is on pace for a second straight Conference USA championship. Partridge said he can pattern some things after what coach Doc Holiday has done since 2010.\n\"I talked to Doc a decent amount,\" Partridge said. \"I met him when he was at N.C. State. You look at what he did. He built a program. He had a bowl-game season his second year â€¦ Now, he's had the chance to build a program. Sure, there are things that they do that we'll model just like any good program.\"\nNext game: FAU vs. Marshall, Noon, Saturday, Fox College Sports\nsrichardson@tribpub.com\n Florida Atlantic Owls Marshall Thundering Herd Conference USA", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56202a8d/turbine/fl-fau-owls-news-1016-20151015"], "published": "2015-10-15T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:49:39.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
