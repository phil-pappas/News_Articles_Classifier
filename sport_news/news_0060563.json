Lynch was reportedly driving a red Dodge Charger.\nAccording to TMZ:\nSeveral other players, including Richard Sherman, stopped at the accident scene and attempted to help Jackson out of the car. Police showed up, but we're told Seahawks staffers showed up and took Jackson back to the team facility — and Lynch drove off, uninjured. It's unclear if Jackson suffered any injuries.\nThe Seattle Times reports that Jackson was not injured in the crash.\nJackson, who spent the first nine years of his career with the Bills, was released by the team in late August. He was signed by the Seahawks just a few days later. Jackson has 10 carries for 52 yards and 12 catches for 110 yards and a touchdown this season.\nLynch has said that he considered Jackson a mentor when they played together in Buffalo from 2007-10.\nCar being towed. pic.twitter.com/vCTRxzCB48\n— Bob Condotta (@bcondotta) October 21, 2015 Skid marks on other side of street. pic.twitter.com/twfApCla95\n— Bob Condotta (@bcondotta) October 21, 2015 Car now gone. pic.twitter.com/1b9xJZUFnf\n— Bob Condotta (@bcondotta) October 21, 2015 Downed street signs. pic.twitter.com/MEs1xqSwom\n— Bob Condotta (@bcondotta) October 21, 2015 The downed stop sign. pic.twitter.com/qdyNMMU8KZ\n— Bob Condotta (@bcondotta) October 21, 2015 Skid mark in front of welcome sign. pic.twitter.com/bczc7keR5s\n— Bob Condotta (@bcondotta) October 21, 2015", "external_links": ["https://t.co/1b9xJZUFnf", "https://twitter.com/bcondotta/status/656637012540198912", "https://t.co/S70o2R34tt", "https://twitter.com/bcondotta/status/656638086147801088", "https://twitter.com/bcondotta/status/656638378121691136", "https://twitter.com/bcondotta/status/656632528099381248", "https://t.co/vCTRxzCB48", "https://twitter.com/bcondotta/status/656637254106918912", "https://t.co/qdyNMMU8KZ", "https://twitter.com/bcondotta/status/656641640849784832", "https://t.co/bczc7keR5s", "https://t.co/MEs1xqSwom", "http://www.tmz.com/2015/10/20/marshawn-lynch-drag-race-fred-jackson/#ixzz3p9xY6gYp", "https://twitter.com/bcondotta/status/656640552851501056", "http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/seahawks/seattle-seahawks-fred-jackson-crashes-car-after-drag-racing-with-marshawn-lynch-report-says/", "https://t.co/twfApCla95"], "published": "2015-10-21T10:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:33:17.464+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
