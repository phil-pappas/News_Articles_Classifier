Midlands champion Rob Hunt. \nHe wants to prove to promoter Eddie Hearn he belongs in their company, with Stourbridge’s Sam Eggington topping the bill defending the British and Commonwealth straps at his weight. \nHunt has almost four times the pro experience of Wiggins, despite being almost six years his junior, and has come of age this year. \nHe claimed Midlands honours on points with a fine performance against Sullivan Mason, before claiming only a third paid stoppage over Amir Unsworth. \nHe said: “I really feel like I’m peaking now. I’m coming into a bit of power, too, but it’s more about the range of punches that I’m finding. \n“It’s taken a long time for me to get where I am but, for the first time, I’ve got the confidence to be looking towards bigger and better things. \n“Any fight for my title is a big one to me and for it to happen on this stage just makes me get up for it even more. Live on television or not, this is a huge opportunity. \n“I’ve put everything into my training camp and all of my focus on retaining my belt and looking good doing it. \n“I’ve been in the pro game for nine years and spent a lot of time in the ring. I want to make that experience count come fight night. \n“Wiggins seems made for me. He’s short and stocky, a come forward fighter who can box as well, but all of my work will come off the jab. Rob Hunt (left) in action against Sullivan Mason for the Midlands title. \n“I’ll take my time to work him out and, if we have to go toe-to-toe, he’ll find out how fast my hands can be.” \nHunt was considered as a challenger when Eggington claimed the British title in July, for what would have been voluntary defence. \nThe injured Frankie Gavin and now late replacement Dale Evans have been picked since, but Hunt would also have taken the fight. \nHe said: “At one point, I was almost expecting the call and you don’t turn down a shot at the British title. Maybe my name isn’t big enough for that yet. \n“I’m chuffed just to be in the mix and I want to make sure I stay there.” More on this story:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:10:22.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
