BUKATY/ASSOCIATED PRESS The Half Dome is one of many attractions that has drawn visitors to Yosemite National Park for 125 years. Home to the Half Dome and one of the country's most breathtaking waterfalls, Yosemite National Park celebrates its 125th birthday on Thursday.\nOn Oct. 1, 1890, Congress made 1,500 square miles of land in Central California's Sierra Nevada a National Park, the third time this had been done in American history.\nPresident Benjamin Harrison signed the law into action and preserved the park, which is also a World Heritage Site.\nAt an impressive height of 2,425 feet, Yosemite Falls is the fifth highest waterfall in the world. The park is also known for its giant sequoia trees.\nHere are six other National Parks with stunning sights to see.\nYellowstone National Park\nThe first ever National Park, Yellowstone spans three states but is mostly located in Wyoming.\nAnick Jesdanun/AP Yellowstone National Park is famous for geysers that spurt out of the ground at regular intervals. Covering over two million acres of land, the park is larger than Rhode Island and Delaware combined and is home to 322 species of birds.\nMillions of visitors a year travel to the park mainly to see its geysers, six of which erupt 100 feet or higher every day.\nOld Faithful is the most famous of these sputtering water spectacles. It bursts out of the ground approximately once every 45 to 90 minutes.\nRedwood National Park\nIf any of the trees in this forest fell, they'd definitely be heard.\nStahl, Bill Jr. A canopy of trees covers the ground below at Redwood National Park. It's rare to see that happen to Redwood trees, though, because they grow so close together.\nThis Northern California state park features some of the world's tallest — and oldest — trees, from Redwoods to Spruces to Douglas-firs.\nThese trees can live over 2,000 years and rise to 300 feet, creating a canopy covering high above the ground.\nGrand Teton National Park\nA striking background of mountain ranges frames this Wyoming Park, which borders Yellowstone and soars 7,000 feet above the valley of Jackson Hole.\nThe park is rife with wildlife and it is not uncommon to see Elk and other animals roaming the grounds.\nIn fact, the National Parks service issues a warning to Grand Teton visitors to travel in groups of three or four and to carry bear spray, because black and grizzly bears call this park home.\nTed S. Warren/AP A sprawiling mountain range frames the background of Grand Teton National Park. Try to avoid Teton in the winter — the coldest temperature in the history of the park was negative 63 degrees Fahrenheit.\nCrater Lake National Park\nThe body of water from which this park derives its name is coveted for a mystifying blue color.\nCrater Lake reaches 1,949 feet below the surface, making it the deepest lake in the U.S. and the second deepest in North America.\nJeff Barnard/AP The water of Crater Lake is especially blue. A massive eruption of the volcanic Mount Mazama 7,700 years ago left a caldera in its wake, and over time the buildup of precipitation made the lake what it is today.\nOne signature feature of the lake's surface is a mountain hemlock that has been jutting out of the water for over 100 years and is aptly nicknamed \"The Old Man.\"\nAcadia National Park\nOne of the few National Parks to visit on the east coast, this Northeastern attraction is famous for Cadillac Mountain.\nIt is the tallest mountain along the east coast and towers above the park.\nRobert F. Bukaty/AP From October 7 through March 6, Acadia National park is the first place in the U.S. to see the sunrise. It's best to visit Acadia in the coming months, because from Oct. 7 through March 6, it is the first place in the U.S. to see the sunrise, according to the park's website .\nSequoia National Park\nMuch like Yosemite, this park protects massive sequoia trees and houses the largest tree in the world.\nThe General Sherman Tree is located at the north end of Giant Forest and is approximately 52,500 cubic feet in volume, according to measurements taken in 1975.\nTAMMY LECHNER/Associated Press Sequoia National Park is home to the world’s largest tree and the Nation’s Christmas Tree. Christmas trees owe a lot to Sequoia as well, because the General Grant Tree was the original - let's just say Charlie Brown would be floored by its size.\nIn 1926 President Calvin Coolidge named it the Nation's Christmas Tree, and the Sanger Chamber of Congress still organizes an annual \"Trek to the Tree\" on the second Sunday of December.\nschiusano@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Where's the bears?
