The Bucs are the only team in the league without a conference loss. They travel next week to Cape Fear, which is in second place in the Mid-South with a 3-1 league record after Friday’s loss to E.E. Smith. \nAgainst South View (2-8, 0-5 Mid-South), the Bucs jumped out to a 31-0 lead in the first quarter, capitalizing on a pair of interceptions, a blocked punt and four short-field drives in the opening frame. \nThe Bucs scored on the opening drive, going 55 yards on six plays, including a 1-yard scoring run by quarterback Bryan Bryant. \nBryant has a second running touchdown in the first quarter, a 43-yard break up the middle. He finished the night with 81 yards rushing on six carries. \nHe threw for 124 yards, completing six of 10 attempts. Bryant’s top target was Keshawn Wynn, who caught four passes for 96 yards and a touchdown. \n“This was about everybody making the effort to do their part,” Wynn said. “When everybody does their part and makes plays, we’re going to win.” \nA running clock, which is automatic in the second half of games which reached a 42-point margin, was implemented before halftime. \nThe Tigers got on the board in the third quarter when freshman quarterback Donovan Brewington capped an eight-play, 74-yard drive with a 5-yard scramble across the goal line. \nTigers’ coach Rodney Brewington said his team was “overwhelmed” by Britt’s speed, size and experience. \n“I hope that team goes on to represent us in the state championship,” Brewington said. “I think that is state champion-quality team. I’m pulling for the Mid-South and anybody that makes it out of our conference.” \nStaff writer Jaclyn Shambaugh can be reached at 609-0651 or shambaughj@fayobserver.com . \nSouth View: 0 0 7 0—7 \nJack Britt: 31 14 0 0—45 \nJB — Bryan Bryant 1 run (Brad Wanovich kick) \nJB — Jacquel Webster 4 run (Wanovich kick) \nJB — Bryant 43 run (Trevor Locklear run) \nJB — Alphonzo Williams 16 pass from Bryant (Wanovich kick) \nJB — Safety punt blocked out of the end zone by Keith Stevenson \nJB — Keshawn Wynn 34 pass from Bryant (Wanovich kick) \nJB — Greg Davis 3 run (Wanovich kick) \nSV — Donovan Brewington 5 run (Jaymond Easter) \nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS \nRushing: SV — Keyonis Hopkins 10-52, Amos Murray 3-22, C.D.
