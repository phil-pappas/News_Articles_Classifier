Source: New York Post\nIt’s a tough-girl image that Govan clearly wasn’t ready to shed.\nHer ex, Barnes, a forward for the Memphis Grizzlies, once played with Fisher when they were both on the Los Angeles Lakers’ roster. And now dating her ex-husband’s former teammate has one of her Basketball Wives co-stars calling foul.\n“From a ‘girl-code’ standpoint, I feel like Gloria may have violated it,” Tami Roman, ex-wife of retired LA Clippers point guard Kenny Anderson, told the New York Post .\nRoman is close friends with Fisher’s ex, Candace, who was blindsided by divorce papers in March, a month after her and Fisher’s 10-year anniversary.\nMatt Barnes and Gloria Govan.

You just don’t do that. You see so much t–s and ass, you don’t have to pick within the [basketball] circle.”\nDrama aside, Roman says Govan and Barnes could still reconcile.\n“Now for Matt’s actions, betrayal is only a feeling that you have when you still love. So he may feel betrayed probably because in his heart he still loves Gloria.”\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.nypost.com/", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/24df4967886d49711e7b9fa77ac459c5", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/cb3577a8da33c871dcef8a205228d8ad", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/eeee7b43018c77c07422e46b57a2e40c", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1720978fefedc055603021650098e785", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9d580a74c0c1443add35e2cdbda00733", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-12T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:50:05.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
