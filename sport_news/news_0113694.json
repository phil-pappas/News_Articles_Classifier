(AP) — A 19-year-old University of Connecticut student who went on a drunken, obscenity-laced tirade against food service workers for refusing to sell him jalapeno-bacon macaroni and cheese is no longer enrolled at the university and has been banned from all school property, UConn officials said Wednesday.\nIt wasn’t clear if Luke Gatti, a former freshman from Bayville, New York, was expelled or left on his own accord. Under federal law, UConn is barred from disclosing details of disciplinary cases involving students, university spokeswoman Stephanie Reitz said.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below Gatti and his attorney didn’t return messages seeking comment Wednesday.\nGatti was arrested on misdemeanor charges of breach of peace and trespassing in connection with the Oct. 4 outburst, which was captured on a video that was widely viewed on the Internet. Gatti argued with a food service supervisor and shoved him.\nGatti later posted a video in which he apologized, acknowledged he was intoxicated and said he was ashamed of his behavior.\nUConn police issued a no trespassing order to Gatti on Wednesday morning after being notified by school officials that he was no longer affiliated with the university, said Hans Rhynhart, UConn’s deputy police chief.\nThe criminal charges against Gatti remain pending. He is due in Rockville Superior Court on Nov. 3.\nGatti previously was a student at the University of Massachusetts and was arrested twice last year on disorderly conduct charges, according to the Daily Hampshire Gazette. During one of those arrests, he was accused of using a racial slur against a police officer, according to court filings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:08:28.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
