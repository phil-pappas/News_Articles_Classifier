The research examined the strategies used to reduce prolonged sitting and observed that people who reduced their sitting time had 60 per cent more benefits in prolonged sitting compared to ones who didn’t reduce. The researchers suggested provision of sit-stand work desks, encouraging people to keep records of their sitting time, setting individual goals for limiting sitting time, and using cues to remind people to stop them sitting. Previous studies and reviews have shown that higher levels of sitting are linked with cancer, diabetes, heart disease and even an early death, independently of whether a person takes regular exercise. The research is published in the journal Health Psychology Review. Fatty liver not ‘noticed’ in diabetics A new research has revealed that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a frequent finding problem in type 2 diabetes patients, but most of the time either this is neglected or goes unnoticed. The investigators used non-invasive imaging techniques to estimate liver fat and liver stiffness in multiple diabetes patients and observed the prevalence of NAFLD 65 per cent in type 2 diabetes patients. Experts said that screening asymptomatic diabetics could help prevent advanced liver damage and reduce liver-related complications and deaths. The research is published in Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics journal. Chronic diseases up dementia risk Higher the number of your chronic conditions, greater could be your risk of developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia, says a new study. The findings suggest that preventing chronic diseases may help ageing adults maintain their mental health. The researchers assessed 2,176 cognitively normal participants who were in an average age of 78.5 years and were followed for four years. Participants with more than one chronic condition were 38 per cent more likely to develop MCI/dementia. Participants with four or more conditions had a 61 per cent increased risk compared with those with no chronic condition or just one such condition. The study appeared in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. Kidney stones may put kids at heart disease risk There is a clear link between kidney stones in children and thickened or hardened arteries, responsible for cardiovascular diseases, says a study. Previous research has established a connection between kidney stones and atherosclerosis in adults. This study is the first to identify the link in kids. If the processes of kidney stone formation and hardening of the arteries are linked in adults, a similar link may exist in children, despite the fact that people don’t associate heart diseases with kids. Researchers used ultrasound exams to evaluate and compare the thickness of key arteries for 15 children with kidney stones and 15 children without them. They detected a significant increase in the thickness of the right carotid artery and average artery thickness in children with a recent kidney stones. The study was published in the Journal of Pediatrics. — Agencies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:26:31.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
