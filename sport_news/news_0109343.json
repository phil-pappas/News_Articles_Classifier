The worst-performing hands-free system, found in the Mazda 6, provided the same level of distraction as updating social media while driving, the study found.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below “Motorists could miss stop signs, pedestrians and other vehicles while the mind is readjusting to the task of driving,” Peter Kissinger, president and CEO of the foundation, said in a statement.\nThough the Bay State banned texting while driving in 2010, it is one of three New England states , along with Maine and Rhode Island, that still allow drivers to pick up their phones and make a call.\nThe ban on hand-held mobile devices while driving in New Hampshire, the “Live Free or Die State,” went into effect July 1 , months after Vermont’s hand-held ban became law in October 2014. Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey also ban hand-held devices while driving.\nMassachusetts lawmakers are currently considering legislation that would make the use of hand-held phones while driving illegal, though two similar bills have failed recently on Beacon Hill.\nMary Maguire, the director of public and governmental affairs for AAA Southern New England, told Boston.com that the group supports hands-free cell phone bills in Massachusetts, even if they don’t make things completely risk-free.\n“We testified in favor because we believe it’s the only way to enforce the critically important texting ban,” Maguire said. “That being said, we believe hands-free is only part of the solution because hands-free is not risk-free.”\nRep. William Straus, who introduced a hands-free law this session, told the Associated Press in October he expects a public hearing on his bill this fall.\n“There is no personal liberty to create unnecessary hazards for other members of the public,” Straus said.", "external_links": ["http://www.wcvb.com/news/backers-urge-handsfree-law-for-massachusetts-drivers/34745332", "http://www.wmur.com/news/police-drivers-react-to-new-handsfree-law/33942726", "https://malegislature.gov/Bills/189/House/H3315/History", "http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/laws/cellphonelaws/maphandheldcellbans?topicName=Distracted%20driving#map", "http://newsroom.aaa.com/2015/10/new-hands-free-technologies-pose-hidden-dangers-for-drivers/", "http://highwaysafety.vermont.gov/phonesdown"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:54:03.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
