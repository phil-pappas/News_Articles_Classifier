That was with 6:14 left in the game. \nCommodore running back Ralph Webb ran 39 yards for a touchdown with 1:12 left in the game to give Vanderbilt the victory. \nThe run game struggled for both teams early. \nThe first half of the game began as a defensive chess match between MTSU’s offense and Vanderbilt’s stout defense, and neither team score a touchdown. \nA couple of Cody Clark field goals put up MTSU up 6-3 at the half and the first touchdown didn’t come until early in the fourth quarter. \nQuarterback Brent Stockstill found wide receiver Ed Batties for an 18-yard score on third down to give the Blue Raiders the deciding score. \nThe Blue Raiders almost didn’t have an opportunity to score on that drive but caught a break after a roughing after a roughing-the-snapper call on Vanderbilt. \nJust a few plays later, the Blue Raiders hopped out to the biggest lead of the night. \nThe Blue Raider defense held Vanderbilt quarterback McCrary in check for the most part, not allowing him to scramble for big yardage in the first half. \nMTSU’s defense flustered McCrary early, allowing safeties Alex Dale and Kevin Byard to record interceptions. \nDale’s interception was the first of his career while Kevin Byard tied the MTSU school record for most interceptions, 17 in a career. \nThe Blue Raider rush defense also kept talented Vanderbilt running back Ralph Webb in check holding the back to 4.7 yards through three quarters. \nDerek Mason’s offense could not find a way early to ground and pound it up the middle with one of the longest runs coming from wide receiver Trent Sherfield. \nSherfield was the second leading rusher through a majority of the game as the Commodores failed to bust big runs against MTSU’s experienced front seven. \nMTSU will take its 2-3 squad to Bowling Green top face Conference USA rival Western Kentucky. \nReach Aldo Amato at 615-278-5109 and on Twitter @Aldo_Amato", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T09:49:15.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
