In Richardson's first two years, the team was swept in the Best of Five opening round of the AHL Playoffs by rival Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins. Last year, the B-Sens failed to even make the playoffs. Entering his 4th year, Richardson's roster looks vastly different with ten new players on the squad for Saturday's season opener. With a nice mix of older veterans and new prospects, at trip back to the playoffs is all but mandatory. \"That's really not even a question this year, that's a definite,\" Richardson said. \"We want to be in the playoffs but we want to be a team that's going to challenge anybody for any night in the playoffs and push it as far as we can.\" \"It would be fun to stay for June or whatever it is,\" said defenceman Frederik Claesson. \"Playoffs is a different thing than the regular season so it'd be fun to do something like that.\" The B-Sens open the season on Saturday at home against the Albany Devils.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:33:13.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
