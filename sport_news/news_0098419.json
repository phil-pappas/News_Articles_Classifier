He then started against Kansas City on Sept. 28, but lasted only three plays before exiting the game. He didn't play last week at San Francisco.\nMeanwhile, Burnett missed the regular-season opener Sept. 13 at Chicago with a calf injury suffered in preseason, played against the Seahawks and re-injured it in practice before the Chiefs game.\nCoach Mike McCarthy's comments Friday hinted that the team would take a cautious approach to Adams and Burnett because both returned to action only to get re-injured and miss more time.\n\"All these injuries, they're a little different,\" McCarthy said. \"(But) the fact of the matter is, this is the second time, so that's part of the evaluation. Just the fact that it's the second time, same injury (is a factor).\"\nThe Packers also added cornerbacks LaDarius Gunter (heel) and Sam Shields (toe) to the injury report as probable.\nRight tackle Bryan Bulaga, who suffered a left knee injury in practice Sept. 17 and has missed the past three games, remains listed as questionable but is expected to return.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:39:16.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
