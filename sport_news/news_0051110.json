I was there for a test event in August. The organisers told me that the water will be fully clean and safe by early next year.” \nCarlo Dalla Vedova \nRio de Janeiro will host the Games from August 5-21 next year. \nDuring the sailing test events held at the venue in August, the sailors had complained about floating debris and allegedly found dead animals in the water. \nVedova, however, insisted that he is pleased with the progress made to clean the water and 'trusted the Brazilian organisers to deliver clean water'. \nWith less than a year to go for the big event, the Italian chief of the world windsurfing body said, “The venue at Guanabara Bay is not that dirty as reports have projected it to be. We had successful test events there and I personally love the place. \n“I think the protests in Brazil over water pollution is a political matter. I am not too concerned and I am confident that Rio will deliver the best windsurfing competition.” \nDuring a test event in Rio in August, South Korean windsurfer Wonwoo Choo, ho is also participating in the worlds at the Musannah Sports City, had been hospitalised after catching a virus, with his coach alleging that his ward may have fallen sick due to an issue with the water. \nLater, the International Sailing Federation (ISAF) and the Rio 2016 organisers said that there was no direct evidence to suggest that the sailor's illness was caused by contact with the water. \nWhen Rio pipped Madrid, Chicago and Tokyo in 2009 to host the 2016 Olympics, one of the key promises in its winning bid was to cut pollution in Guanabara Bay by 80 per cent. \nBut according to recent media reports, the Brazilian government is struggling to achieve it and may not be able to clean up the venue in time for the Games. \nVedova, however, maintained that the Rio Games would be a success despite the misgivings. \n2017 worlds to be hosted by Japan \nVedova presided over the annual general meeting at the Musannah Sports City on the sidelines of the RS:X World Windsurfing Championships. \nAmong the major decisions taken was the awarding of the 2017 event. The worlds will be hosted by Enoshima, Japan, the same venue for sailing during the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. \nAlso, the youth worlds will be held in Torbole, Italy and the European championships in Marseille, France. \nSpeaking about the development plans, Vedova said that 'the sport is the entry door for sailing and is practised in nearly 50 countries'. \n“We want to take the sport to newer places. The world championship in Oman is part of our efforts to spread the game and we are happy that the event has attracted top sailors from nearly 40 countries,” he said.
