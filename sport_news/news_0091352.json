He can still take plenty of positives into the winter as he looks ahead to 2016. \nHeston lasted 3 2-3 innings and gave up eight runs in the San Francisco Giants' 9-3 loss to the Colorado Rockies on Friday night. \nHeston (12-11), who threw a no-hitter in New York against the Mets on June 9, went 1-6 over his last 11 starts and allowed 12 runs over his final 8 2-3 innings. \n\"You want to take a good outing into the offseason, but I can take the whole season and try to build on it,\" Heston said. \"My velocity was down and I walked a ton more people in the second half. I'm going to work on getting stronger and being ready for spring training.\" \nA 12th-round draft pick in 2009, Heston was 11-5 with a 3.14 ERA at the end of play on July 27. He didn't win again for two months. \n\"He had his ups and downs and was really good at times,\" manager Bruce Bochy said. \"Overall it was a good year for him. He just got spotty at the end.\" \nBochy echoed the need to cut down on walks and said Heston's 177 2-3 innings pitched caught up to him. \n\"It's the first time he pitched through September,\" Bochy said. \"I'd like to see him stay aggressive on every pitch and every hitter.\" \nNolan Arenado hit his NL-leading 42nd home run and broke the major league record for extra-base hits in a season by a third baseman as the Rockies ended a three-game losing streak. \nCorey Dickerson added his third homer in eight games for the Rockies. Carlos Gonzalez had an RBI single and winning pitcher Kyle Kendrick walked and scored as part of a five-run third inning when Colorado broke the game open. \nArenado homered off Heston leading off the fourth, then added a two-run double in the third. That gave the Rockies slugger 88 extra-base hits, breaking Chipper Jones' single-season record set in 1999. \nKendrick (7-13) benefited from Arenado's big night to win for the third time since coming off the disabled list Sept. 1. \nBrandon Crawford had two hits and two RBIs for the Giants. The defending World Series champions have lost two of three since being eliminated from playoff contention. \nColorado had scored more than six runs just twice in its previous 29 road games before its uprising against Heston, who gave up eight hits, walked one and struck out three. \nWILLIE MAC AWARD \nGiants 3B Matt Duffy was honored with the Willie Mac award, named for Hall of Fame slugger Willie McCovey, who was on hand to announce the winner. Duffy became the first rookie to win the award, which is voted on by the players. \"That's how respected he is,\" Bochy said. \"How hard he plays the game, every pitch and every at-bat. It's a great honor.\" \nTRAINER'S ROOM \nGiants: OF Nori Aoki will not play again this season and will instead continue his recovery from a concussion. The decision was made after Aoki met with specialist Michael Collins in Pittsburgh for a second time in an attempt to get cleared to play. \nUP NEXT \nRockies: LHP Chris Rusin (6-9) tries Saturday to win for only the second time in 11 road starts this season. \nGiants: RHP Jake Peavy (7-6) has won his last four decisions, including a 7-3 victory over the Rockies on Sept. 5 when he allowed three runs over 5 2-3 innings. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:11:54.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
