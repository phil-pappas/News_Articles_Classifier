This October, I've become a Mets fan again. I may no longer view New York's two baseball teams as the distillation of good and evil, and the combination of the Dodgers, Cubs and Royals doesn’t make nearly as fun a villain to be dispatched as the late-90s Braves or Yankees. But this postseason, I have watched or listened to every inning of the Mets' nine postseason games. The same reporter who mocks you when you accuse him of jinxing a no-hitter has obsessively worn the same T-shirt for all seven Mets wins this fall. (To be clear, it's not a Mets shirt; I never wear Mets stuff while watching their games on TV. That's a lesson learned on my 13th birthday, when I sported a brand-new jersey for Game Six of the National League Championship Series only to tear it off when Al Leiter allowed five first-inning runs without recording an out. It's not superstition if it's logical like that, right? Or did I just jinx this year's shirt?) My investment level in the Mets' success has been as big a surprise as that success itself. Cheering is verboten in the press box, where you're only allowed to root for quick games, good storylines and your own professional advancement. Honestly, I thought most of my affinity for the Mets had been beaten out of me over the seven years I've spent covering Major League Baseball, including an internship covering the Mets when the team's fortunes began plummeting southward in 2009. So much of baseball fandom is about the day to day, and when you live in a different city and follow a different baseball team for five years, you lose that sense of connection. Over the last several years, the number of Mets games I've watched has ranged from \"a few\" to \"maybe several\" each season. I had never heard of Jacob deGrom before New York called him up last May. Only three players remain from the last Mets team I rooted for, back in 2008: David Wright, Daniel Murphy and Jonathon Niese. My detachment coincided with a fallow run in the relevance department. The highlights of New York's last six seasons are probably Jose Reyes winning a batting title (before departing as a free agent that winter), R.A. Dickey winning a Cy Young (before being traded that winter) and Johan Santana finally throwing the franchise's first no-hitter (before suffering a shoulder injury he's yet to return from, three and a half years later). What the Mets had going for them was good food along the center-field concourse and a particularly candid and enjoyable broadcast trio. It does at times feel more like the proverbial cheering for laundry — though it's been better laundry since they ditched the black uniforms and drop-shadow. Page 2 of 2 - But it's also cheering for your fellow fans — the brothers whose love for Doc Gooden and Darryl Strawberry initiated you into baseball in the 1980s and the less-than-a-handful of friends who grew up pulling for Todd Hundley and Mike Piazza even though Derek Jeter and the Yankees would have made childhood so much happier each October. That’s the thing about being a Mets fan of my generation. I was eight days old the last time they won a championship. They have allowed the winning run of an NLCS in an opponent's final at-bat twice, on my birthday — curses to Kenny Rogers and Yadier Molina. I was in fourth grade when the Yankees started their late-90s dynasty and when interleague play ratcheted up a rivalry previously limited to spring training. Fourth graders are suggestible types, and even while living within a roughly 75-minute drive of Shea Stadium, I was one of just two Mets fans in my class. You learn quickly how much tribalism influences your otherwise rational thought processes when you've spent part of your life actually believing Rey Ordoñez to be a superior all-around player to Jeter. And so more than Daniel Murphy's Ruthian hot streak or a rotation that has exceeded even lofty expectations for the last Generation K, my favorite part of New York's success this October has been rediscovering that connection to other Mets fans. It's liking photos on Facebook and Instagram from friends you haven't seen in a decade. It's trying to explain the nuances of the Chase Utley slide ruling to my parents and to an aunt who doesn’t usually watch baseball but who sure thinks that kind of nonsense shouldn’t be allowed. It's in-game texts and postgame phone calls with my older brothers. They've humored me by pretending to care what's going on with the Red Sox the past few years, the way I've humored them by pretending to care what's going on with their fantasy teams. (I apologize for advocating on behalf of Ryan Lavarnway in my brother's deep A.L.-only league in 2012.) These days, we're breaking down Terry Collins' bullpen management and Curtis Granderson's long-underrated lineup presence and how aw-shucks-good we feel for Wright making it this far. This weekend we'll share tickets at Citi Field and watch the Mets play in the World Series. I'll be the guy in a T-shirt from the Gap that doesn’t smell that great right now. And I'll be really happy to be there. By Tim Britton", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-27T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:37:58.883+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
