The Quote: of the week comes from Randy Richardson, a farmer from Riceville, Iowa, who ran unopposed for his local school board and still failed to earn any votes — not even his own — but he’ll probably still get the job.\nRichardson, 42, didn’t find time to vote for himself between his full-time maintenance job at a bean processing plant in Riceville and his chores on his farm near McIntire. The Des Moines Register reported Richardson was recruited to run by school staff, and though he said he’s “run paper thin the way it is,” he agreed because he has two kids in the district.\nThe school board district Richardson was running for is also home to a number of Amish and Mennonite farmers who typically don’t vote. There are only 122 registered voters who could have voted for Richardson. Across the entire school district, only 36 people voted in the Sept. 8 election.\nMighty hit with the Texas Rangers on Friday and likes Boston College on Saturday. The deficit is 870 sirignanos.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:09:27.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
