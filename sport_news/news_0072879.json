EAST RUTHERFORD – Victor Cruz’s return to the football field has been put on hold indefinitely.\nThe reality of that admittedly left the Giants’ star wide receiver tossing and turning a bit at home Thursday night, knowing just how close his comeback appeared to the finish line, only to have his time away extended by yet another unfortunate misstep.\n“I haven’t lost faith, I know that my time is going to come,” Cruz said, speaking with reporters Friday for the first time since a flare-up of his left calf injury squelched his chance at rejoining the Giants for Sunday’s game against the Bills in Orchard Park, N.Y. “When that time is, is still up in the air. But I know my time will come back here in a blue uniform with the New York Giants.”\nCruz said an MRI of his calf showed Wednesday’s setback “didn’t cause any further damage. It wasn’t as bad as the initial aggravation.”\nBut the Paterson native, on the advice of the team’s medical staff, received a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection at the Hospital for Special Surgery to help quicken the healing of the injury. The use of PRP can play a key role in the process of wound and soft tissue healing. The procedure has become common in professional sports, including the NFL.\nTom Coughlin said the Giants, at this point, are not considering placing Cruz on injured reserve with designation to return, but there is no timetable for his recovery.\n“Whatever they can do to get him better,” Coughlin said of Cruz, “we’re all for it.”\nCruz, 28, has not gone through a full practice without limitation since he tweaked his calf during training camp Aug. 17. He is also coming off surgery to repair a torn patellar tendon in his right knee suffered against the Eagles last Oct. 12 in Philadelphia.\n“You gear up for that moment when you want to be ready to play and ready to go out there and perform and you have another setback,” Cruz said. “Hopefully, it’s the last setback. I’m going to continue to work hard, I’m going to continue to be the same person I am in regards to my work ethic and the strength it takes to get back and to physically go in that rehab room and do that work you need to do in order to succeed and get back on the field. That’s never going to falter. So it’s unfortunate, but it’s something that I have to look forward to and turn it into a positive.”\nDr. David Chao, former team physician of the Chargers, estimated Friday that the recovery from PRP injections can range anywhere from 2-6 weeks.\nThe current plan is for Cruz to get together with team doctors Monday, assess how his calf responded to the treatment and put the rehabilitation schedule in order from there, Cruz said.\nThe Giants could end up using Sunday’s game to determine if the combination of Dwayne Harris and Geremy Davis can help pick up the slack for Cruz as long as he remains out or if they need to try and add an impact player at the position.\nFormer Pro Bowler Wes Welker and former Giants first-round pick Hakeem Nicks worked out for the team earlier this week.\nBRIEFS: DE Robert Ayers (hamstring) was ruled out for Sunday’s game, meaning rookie DE Owa Odighizuwa will likely make his NFL debut. LT Ereck Flowers (ankle) and TE Daniel Fells (ankle) are questionable. The Bills ruled out RB LeSean McCoy (hamstring) and WR Sammy Watkins (calf).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:10:32.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
