(Photo: Jerry Lai, USA TODAY Sports) \nCHICAGO – Breaking down Game 3 of the National League Championship Series between the Cubs and Mets at Wrigley Field: \nMets 5, Cubs 2. Mets lead series 3-0. \n*** \nThe final: Jacob deGrom became the first Mets pitcher ever to win three postseason games on the road, Yoenis Cespedes drove in two runs and Daniel Murphy cranked out yet another home run as New York moved within a victory of the World Series. \nDeGrom gave up solo homers to Kyle Schwarber and Jorge Soler but was otherwise in command as the Mets’ pitching continued to impose its will. Chicago has scored a total of five runs in the series. \n*** \nState of the series: After dropping the first three games, the Cubs would need a historic comeback to gain a berth in the World Series for the first time since 1945. No team has ever overcome a 3-0 deficit in the NLCS. \nThe Mets have relied on young flamethrowers to start games all postseason and intend to continue doing so on Wednesday, when they send out rookie Steven Matz to the mound. The highly regarded left-hander went 4-0 with a 2.27 ERA in six starts in an injury-shortened season, then allowed three runs in five innings while taking the loss in Game 4 of the Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. \nBarring any last-minute changes, the Cubs will turn to veteran Jason Hammel, who went 10-7 with a 3.74 ERA in his second stint with Chicago, after rejoining the club in the offseason. Hammel was less effective than Matz in his previous outing this postseason, getting a quick hook after giving up two runs in three innings in a Division Series game the Cubs went on to win against the St. Louis Cardinals. Mets' Daniel Murphy ties postseason home run record \nMan of the moment: Murphy. The second baseman continued his playoff fusillade by pounding a Kyle Hendricks sinker over the center-field fence in the third inning, putting the Mets ahead 2-1. Murphy became the second player in postseason history to homer in five consecutive games. Carlos Beltran, who later became his teammate, first did it with the Houston Astros in 2004. \nMurphy’s six home runs altogether this postseason are a Mets franchise record, and he’s mostly done it against elite pitching. After homering just once off a left-hander during the season, the compactly built second baseman twice took three-time Cy Young Award winner Clayton Kershaw deep in the Division Series. He also victimized Dodgers co-ace Zack Greinke, and cracked one against the Cubs’ Jon Lester (a lefty like Kershaw) and another one against Jake Arrieta in Game 2 of the NLCS. \n*** \nPivot point: With the game tied 2-2 in the sixth and two outs, reliever Trevor Cahill kept throwing Michael Conforto curveballs in the dirt trying to get him to chase for strike three. Conforto finally did, but the ball bounced away for a wild pitch, allowing Cespedes to score from third and Conforto to reach base as the Mets took a 3-2 lead they did not relinquish. \n*** \nNeeding a mulligan: Kris Bryant. The favorite for NL rookie of the year honors went 0-for-4 with two strikeouts, but the play he will really regret is the Murphy chopper he failed to turn into an out in the seventh. With one out and Wright at second, Murphy hit a slow grounder fielded by Bryant, who double-clutched and couldn’t get Murphy at first on what was ruled a single. Cespedes, who probably would have been walked with first base empty, followed with a line single off left fielder Schwarber’s glove to drive in a run, and Murphy beat Anthony Rizzo’s throw to the plate on a groundout to first to make it 5-2 Mets. \n*** \nManagers special: Chicago’s Joe Maddon managed with the urgency of someone who knew the odds of coming back from a 3-0 hole in the postseason. With Hendricks getting into trouble early and often – three of the four hitters he faced leading off innings got on base – Maddon pinch-hit for him in the bottom of the fourth. \nThat meant leaning on a bullpen that had been rock-solid in the playoffs – sporting a 2.41 and a .174 opponents’ batting average in 18 2/3 innings – but also requiring extended innings from some of his less-accomplished relievers. That didn’t pay off when Cahill and Travis Wood yielded runs in the sixth and seventh. \n*** \nWhat you missed on TV: The stillness of the Chicago night. The game-time temperature was 72 degrees – 10-12 degrees above the norm for this time of year – and the wind was nearly non-existent. The flags atop the foul poles were drooping in the first inning and the ones above the grandstand and high atop the scoreboard behind center field fluttered lightly. It was a perfect autumn night for baseball until a light rain fell in the ninth inning. \nGALLERY: NLCS -- METS vs. CUBS A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
