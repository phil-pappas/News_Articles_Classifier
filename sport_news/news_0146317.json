I don't know where they started [with the national team], I only played against them in the Currie Cup. \n\"But everybody has got their own way of doing stuff and they follow their own route. If you want to go and play abroad that's their decision. I'm not going to stand in your way and say South African rugby is the best. \n\"It's your own decision and you have to live with it.\" \nBoks prop Tendai Mtawarira would certainly have prefered Nel had stayed at home after admitting his previous troubles with his opposing tighthead. \n\"I've played against WP a few times when he was at the Cheetahs and I think he is a solid player,\" said the Sharks front-rower, who is nicknamed the 'Beast'. \n\"It certainly wasn't all personal triumph for me in those encounters. The first time I went up against him we lost in the semi-finals of the Currie Cup in 2009. So it's always a tough game against him. \n\"I think he's done really well for himself since he moved abroad so it will be a tough challenge. \n\"But tomorrow will be all about the pack. It's not about individuals. The Scottish pack has been doing well so it will be a big challenge for us.\" \nA bonus-point win for Scotland would guarantee them a place in the knock-out rounds but South Africa know that after losing their Pool B opener with Japan, a second defeat is almost unthinkable. \nThe Scots, though, seem to be taking a relaxed view of the match having named a starting XV with more than a hint of the second string to it. \nThe insinuation from several pundits is that Cotter is resting his big-hitters ahead of facing Samoa in their final Pool B match. \nBut Vermeulen insists the Springboks are determined to continue their resurgence following their win over Samoa in Birmingham last weekend, regardless of the Scottish line-up. \nHe said: \"I don't read the papers so I don't really know how the Scottish team look. I don't really care about the opposition. \n\"It's about the guy on the field. You go out there and it's every man for themselves. You've got to go out there and play as a team. \n\"So I don't really care how they are lining up. \n\"After Japan the vibe wasn't great about the place. Everyone was down. But against Samoa we turned it around. \n\"However, we haven't achieved anything yet. We are still in the same position as we were the week before. We still have to grind it out and this is our next step towards the World Cup.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T17:35:58.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
