Richard Pryor?\nHey, why not? Pryor was famous for decorating his words with the colorful and profane, Angels’ fans probably dropping a few juicy bombs of their own Sunday while watching the team’s bullpen blow up the most important seventh inning of the season.\nThe Angels owner, however, wasn’t thinking that way. Instead, Moreno said it was a very G-rated line from the late comedian that came to mind upon first reflection of the 2015 team.\n“He’s not feeling well and asks the doctor, ‘What are the symptoms?’” Moreno said, telling a joke he has told before. “The doctor says to him, ‘You’re looking at the symptoms.’”\nIn other words, the Angels’ holes – primarily a batting order pocked with dead spots – were as obvious to him as they were to the rest of us, and thank goodness the man who helped build this failed roster is now working in Seattle, where, presumably, he’ll ruin the Mariners next.\nJerry Dipoto resigned as the Angels’ general manager July 1 and his replacement was introduced Monday, Billy Eppler becoming the fourth GM to work over Mike Scioscia.\nIn the typical situation, it’s the general manager who, in an attempt to find the right fit, will go through multiple managers working under him. But everyone knows this Angels team isn’t a typical situation.\nScioscia will return in 2016 for his 17th season, Eppler accepting a job that, simply by the way things are designed around here, must have compromised power.\nMoreno and the Angels deny this, of course, but with Scioscia entrenched and under contract for three more years, this clearly is an arrangement that’s more by committee than the way sports teams traditionally operate.\nThose blurred lines contributed to Dipoto’s departure and always will be something to monitor as long as Scioscia remains manager. That’s not to suggest this setup can’t work; it’s just that, when things don’t go well, the situation can become murky and tricky real fast.\nWho knows? Perhaps Moreno’s loyalty to Scioscia eventually will be rewarded, the extended stability on the Angels’ bench as unusual as anything currently happening among coaches in all of sports.\nBut, from a distance, it looks like something that could invite more stress among people already stressed enough just trying to beat the other guys. Who needs in-fighting in a business that’s all about out-fighting?\nThe best way to avoid problems is for the Angels to win, which, if you haven’t noticed, this franchise has failed to do enough of recently.\nNot since 2009 have the Angels won a playoff game. They’ve won just two postseason series since Moreno took over in May of 2003, despite having an annual payroll at least among the top eight in baseball.\n“I’m disappointed, of course,” Moreno said. “We try to make the best decisions we can. Sometimes, we’re not right. When that happens, you make the best of the situation and move on.”\nThat brings us to the worst decision perhaps in the history of organized sports – Josh Hamilton. On Saturday, he hit two homers for Texas against the Angels, the first giving everyone in Globe Life Park a free Grand Slam breakfast through a promotion with Denny’s.\nBased on the attendance, the restaurant could lose more than $250,000, and exactly how many people these days are watching Hamilton cost them money?\nMoreno is still paying him $60 million over three years, the result of an emotional investment made by a man who once famously lowered the price of beer at Angel Stadium but hasn’t always otherwise made popular financial decisions.\nFor the record, Moreno insisted Monday that acquiring Hamilton wasn’t solely his decision, suggesting that had Dipoto and the team’s baseball operations staff vetoed the signing it never would have happened.\n“It’s not like I walk in the room and say, ‘Hey, guys, look what I’ve got,’” Moreno said. “It really is a collaborative effort. These are things we talk about as a group and make a collective decision.”\nOK, let’s accept that as fact. But let’s also acknowledge that there are easier things to do than say no to your boss, particularly when your boss, according to Forbes magazine, is worth $1.77 billion.\nSo now the Angels are officially on to their offseason, the hiring of Eppler the first of several moves meant to reshape a franchise that just arrived at its 162nd game winded, limping and 13 victories behind its 2014 total.\nThe roster needs to be significantly refortified. For example, on Saturday, the Angels had to pitch Mat Latos and Jo-Jo Reyes. A writer in Fort Worth interpreted those developments as the Angels conceding when, in fact, those were Scioscia’s best options.\nI have no idea if Eppler will be a good general manager, and I’m not sure anyone else does, either. How could they? He’s never been one before.\nAt least this much we know: One hole has been filled, while several others remain. The Angels’ symptoms are obvious. The cure, not so much.\nContact the writer: jmiller@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:29:30.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
