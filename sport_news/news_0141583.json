This call to action follows three armed robberies at popular Uptown businesses.\nMonkey Hill Bar, Atchafalaya and Patois are three Uptown businesses that have been robbed over the past two months. In all three cases, gunmen stormed the businesses and robbed customers and staff inside.\nPatois Restaurant was robbed on August 20, Atchafalaya Restaurant was robbed September 24 and Monkey Hill Bar was robbed on September 28. All seem similar on the surface, but the New Orleans Police Department said they are unsure if the three are related.\nThere is currently a $30,000 CrimeStoppers reward on the line. Federal prosecutors said that if the same group of people is involved in all three incidents, they will face federal punishment.\n\"We are more determined now than ever to track down these individuals that have been terrorizing our residents and terrorizing our businesses,” New Orleans Police Chief Michael Harrison said. “We are using every resource available to prevent crime and take down those individuals who chose to commit it.\"\nFriday’s meeting will take place at 1 p.m. at City Hall to address the high profile crimes. Harrison is scheduled to attend along with senior leadership from the police department. The New Orleans Police Department will also make a special presentation about the crimes and will discuss current strategy to address crime in the city.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
