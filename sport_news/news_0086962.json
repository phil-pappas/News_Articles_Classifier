Though he said it's too early to declare the Jets a playoff contender , he clearly likes the direction this team is heading in.\n\"There's a lot of guys doing that [extra] stuff,\" Marshall said. \"It's just a great spirit in this locker room. It's something I've never been a part of, where you have so many guys moving in the same direction. That's hard to do in this day and age. I've been a part of some teams where we were very fragmented .\"\nThen Marshall acknowledged his own role in that fragmenting .\n\"I've been one, in the past, early on in my career, especially in Denver, contract situation, handled it the wrong way,\" he said. \"We have guys in this locker room that really get it. That's the coolest thing about what we're doing. It's a special group, man. I love seeing guys make a mistake and throw their helmet on the ground, or get kind of pissed off, show that they care. That's across the board — young guys, older guys, scout team players. It's a special locker room.\n\"It's good to be around these guys. It feels good. It's awesome.\"\nMarshall did note that he's been a part of close locker rooms before. Marshall joined the Bears in 2012, when they had guys like Brian Urlacher, Lance Briggs, and Charles Tillman. Marshall specifically pointed out that group's tightness. (Things deteriorated with later Bears locker rooms that Marshall was in.)\nSo Marshall said \"it's still early\" when asked directly if this Jets team is the best locker room he's worked in.\n\"That was special,\" Marshall said of the 2012 Bears team. \"I think we have that. There's a lot of new pieces here, and that's going to take time, to build that type of chemistry. But it's special to see. You have [cornerback] Darrelle Revis hanging out with scout team players. There's no egos. There's no superstars. It's everyone just being themselves and being accepted.\n\"It's a special thing, man, to see guys here at 5 o'clock in the morning, beating coaches in. I'm just proud to be a part of it. That's the coolest part: No one is running around talking about taking over the world. Everyone is just talking about just doing their job and being mindful of the moment. It's inspiring.\"\nLook, it's easy to be sunny at 4-1. Marshall understands that. But there are specific encouraging things he notices about this group of players.\n\"I do think it goes a long way when you see Darrelle Revis , the best player on your team, or one of the best players in the league, pissed off when he makes a mistake or someone catches a ball, or when things aren't going right,\" Marshall said. \"It shows that he cares.\"\nMarshall recalled, as a younger player in Denver, marveling at veteran receiver Rod Smith running gasser sprints at full speed. That image stuck with Marshall.\n\"It definitely pushes the other players,\" Marshall said. \"I don't think our team needs to be pushed, but it is inspiring seeing your stars working the hardest.\"\nMarshall is off to a hot start this season . He's third in the NFL with 102.2 receiving yards per game. But he's 31, and in his 10th season, so at this point, he cares more about finally reaching the playoffs than accumulating stats.\n\"I've done a lot of great things as an individual,\" he said. \"A lot of guys say, 'Ah, I don't think about that.' Guys think about individual accolades, and they love it. But for me, the only thing that matters this year is winning. Now, obviously, I definitely want to play at a high level.\"\nA player's perspective on this \"definitely changes\" with age, Marshall said. \"The window is small in this league. ... I was super immature [earlier in my career], heart was in the right place, but didn't deal with things the right way.\"\nMarshall is averaging 10.6 targets and 7.4 catches per game this season. But it's clear that the Jets' offense starts with running back Chris Ivory . This isn't how things have always been for Marshall.\n\"It's tough, still, when you run the ball on first and second down, and you're like: I'm one-on-one outside, and I'm used to the ball coming [to me] every single time,\" Marshall said. \"But I want to win, so I've accepted that, and just tried to do my best to block for him and other guys.\"\nDarryl Slater may be reached at dslater@njadvancemedia.com .
