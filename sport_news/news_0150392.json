We’ll see. \n“I accept the 41-game suspension handed down to me by the NHL’s Department of Player Safety,” Torres said in a statement released by the Sharks on Thursday. “I worked extremely hard over the last two years following reconstructive knee surgery to resume my NHL career, and this is the last thing I wanted to happen. I am disappointed I have put myself in a position to be suspended again. \n“I sincerely apologize to Jakob for the hit that led to this suspension, and I’m extremely thankful that he wasn’t seriously injured as a result of the play. I also want to apologize to my Sharks teammates and the organization.” \nJudging by the fact Torres said “I accept” the punishment, it’s unlikely he’ll appeal the ruling. \n“The Sharks organization fully supports the NHL’s supplementary discipline decision regarding Raffi,” Sharks GM Doug Wilson said. “While we do not believe there was any malicious intent, this type of hit is unacceptable and has no place in our game. There is a difference between playing hard and crossing the line and there is no doubt, in this instance, Raffi crossed that line. \n“We’re very thankful that Jakob was not seriously injured as a result of this play.” \nSince April of 2011, a span of less than five years, Torres had been suspended, fined or warned a combined nine times by the league prior to the Silfverberg incident.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:53:48.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
