A phone company message said his number was disconnected.\nThe safety administration said in a news release Friday that its investigators and Louisiana State Police found that Gordon had been driving for more than the 14 hours a day allowed under federal safety regulations. The agency also found that his brakes were seriously deficient.\nThe agency didn't say how long he's barred or what appeals are possible.\nCopyright redistributed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:16:28.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
