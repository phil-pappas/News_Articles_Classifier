Maybe you like hoodies. Get your reasons ready if you're interviewing at Facebook; this question comes up a lot, according to interview reviews posted to Glassdoor.\nNearly one-third of the 1,700 interview reviews come from software engineer interviewees. Other popular positions include user operations analyst, product manager and data scientist.\nGiven the nature of the work, it's not surprising that many interview questions have a technical aspect, involving binary trees, data structures and sorting. (For example: \"Find the minimum depth of binary search tree.\") Some job interview questions are a bit more unusual: How many mailboxes are there in San Francisco? How many birthday posts occur on Facebook on a given day? Click through the slides above to see other examples.\nFacebook's interview process has a difficulty rating of 3.2 out of 5, according to Glassdoor, when 5 is the most difficult. If you're comparing, that's easier than interviewing at Google (which got a 3.4 out of 5 on Glassdoor) and Apple (which got a 3.3) and harder than interviewing at Yahoo (which got a 3.0).\nFifty-nine percent of interviewees had a positive experience, according to Glassdoor data. Twenty-two percent had a neutral experience, while 17 percent had a bad time. Several reviewers said they had to sign a non-disclosure agreement.\nApplying online seems to be the best way to land an interview, with 29 percent of reviews coming from online applicants. Twenty-seven percent of reviews came from people who applied through a recruit; 22 percent from people with employee referrals and 15 percent through campus recruiting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:43:32.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
