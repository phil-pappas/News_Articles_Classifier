I help a lot of leg-spinners or general spinners during the year and I would love to help Adil Rashid if the opportunity arises. \n\"I hope he grabs his chance, it would be great to see England have a leg-spinner.\" \nEngland are currently employing the services of former Sri Lanka batsman Mahela Jayawardene as they prepare for the conditions they will face during the series against Pakistan.
