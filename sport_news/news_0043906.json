Or the injured, for that matter. \nThe Kansas State football team welcomes No. 2 TCU to Manhattan this Saturday less than a week after the Wildcats suffered their first defeat of the season — a crushing 36-34 loss on a last-second field goal by Oklahoma State. \n“(Oklahoma State) executed down the stretch and we didn’t,” K-State linebacker Will Davis said. “That’s part of our mantra for the week: To execute at crunch time.” \nHow will the Wildcats (3-1) respond to their first defeat of the season?
