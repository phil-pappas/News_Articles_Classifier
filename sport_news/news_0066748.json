He pitched 3 1/3 innings, giving up three runs (one earned) on five hits with a walk and three strikeouts for the Peoria Javelinas, taking the loss. The two unearned runs came from his own throwing error. Paxton threw 78 pitches with 48 strikes. \nA scout I talked to who was at the game mentioned that Paxton didn’t throw many/if any curveballs in the outing – only the cutter, which Pitch F/X lists as a slider. That may be a way to protect the torn fingernail that Paxton dealt with at the end of the season. Paxton throws a spiked curveball which means that the index finger is lifted like a knuckleball and most of the pressure and spin comes off the middle finger with the beat-up fingernail. But he did throw 12 curveballs in his first outing. Paxton also said at the end of the season that he wanted to focus on his cutter during the AFL, mentioning he’d like to get a better feel with the pitch. \nHere’s the full list of stats for players playing in the winter leagues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:57:20.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
