Unseeded Prannoy rallied from a set down to beat his formidable third-seeded rival 14-21 21-11 21-17 in one hour and 11 minutes. Top seed Nehwal tamed world No. 14 Michelle Li of Canada 21-18 21-13 in a 42-minute match, while eighth seed Kashyap saw off local shuttler Thomas Rouxel 21-11 22-20. The women's doubles pair of Jwala Gutta and Ashwini Ponnappa also advanced to the second round after defeating Thailand’s Jongkolphan Kititharakul and Rawinda Prajongjai 21-15 21-12. However, it was curtains for world No. 5 Kidambi Srikanth as he went down 15-21 21-13 11-21 to Tian Houwei in a 63-minute match. This is Srikanth's fourth loss to the world No. 10 Chinese this season. Prannoy lost the opening set tamely as the former world No. 1 gave him little chance after the two were tied at 7-7. Dan raced ahead to take the set 21-14 in quick time. But the Indian made a remarkable comeback and suddenly Dan was struggling to match Prannoy. In the decider, Prannoy nosed ahead initially but Dan fought back to level the score at 15-15. However, Prannoy stepped on the gas and made his final flourish to take the deciding set 21-17 and win the match. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:13:12.140+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
