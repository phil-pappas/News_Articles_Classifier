Summit County has been blessed with warm, clear days for the past few weeks, and that means golf season is still in full swing (bad pun). Breckenridge, Copper Creek and both Keystone courses closed in early October, but The Raven at Three Peaks in Silverthorne is still booking tee times. How long could the season last? It’s tough to say. In seasons past, The Raven has even closed and reopened following mid-October snowstorms. The golf pros can’t predict when it will close permanently — that’s up to Mother Nature — but as long as the fairways and greens remain playable, be sure to get in a round. It’s only $55 in the off-season when you book online. Hole 16 Par 5 — 601 yards (back tees), 549 yards (ladies tees) When a PGA pro tells you to “grip it and rip it” on a Par 5, you listen. Bud Gazaway wouldn’t play Hole 16 at The Raven any other way. There’s a slight right-hand dogleg, but the tee box is nearly in line with the green as you play slightly downhill over a gentle, rolling fairway. “There’s just not much in your way as you drive from the tee box,” he says of the 601-yard Par 5. “The fairway is lined with trees through the middle, but it’s a generous fairway. You just have to grip it and rip it, baby.” It’s a nice change of pace for a mountain Par 5, which usually feature at least one water hazard (think Hole 11) or massive elevation changes with plenty of trees. But, like Gazaway says, Hole 16 is pretty straightforward — a blessing late in the round, when a manageable birdie is a blessing. And, come autumn, it only helps that the hole is stunning. “Standing from the 16 tee box, you can see as far north along Highway 9 as you want,” he says. “You get Ute Pass in the distance and all the aspens up close. It’s just a very vibrant vista out there.” Hazards: The green can be tricky. Again, there are hardly any trees or other hazards on the hole, and, like the fairway, the green is large and forgiving (It’s The Raven’s largest at 42 yards long). But it’s multi-tiered and lined on the backside with a large ravine that nearly “drops off the face of the earth,” the pro says. Pro tip: Grip it and rip it, simple enough. Hit long and hard on the approach — Gazaway says you can catch a speed slide down the right center of the fairway to reach the green in two strokes — but be careful when you get close to the pin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T23:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:00:52.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
