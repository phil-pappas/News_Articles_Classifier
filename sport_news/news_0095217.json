Mike DiGiovanna of the Los Angeles Times first reported the hire. \nServais, 48, was an assistant general manager for the Angels , and was the leading candidate for the Seattle job, as Heyman recently noted . While current Mariners GM Jerry Dipoto filled the same role for the Angels, Servais worked under him in his current role. \nServais was a major-league catcher for parts of 11 seasons with the Astros, Cubs, Giants, and Rockies. He retired from playing following the 2001 season. \nNot long after Dipoto took over the Mariners in late September , he fired incumbent manager Lloyd McClendon. McClendon across two seasons was two games above .500 with Seattle, but the Mariners in 2015, despite some high expectations, finished 76-86 and in fourth place in the AL West. \nServais is poised to inherit a roster that includes Felix Hernandez , Robinson Cano , Kyle Seager , and Nelson Cruz , among others. \nAngels exec Scott Servais might become the next manager of the Mariners.
