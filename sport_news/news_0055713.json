The site was Cleveland Clinic Courts, and the purpose of the pair's 50 minutes of extra work Wednesday was two-fold.\nAfter undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his right knee on July 1, Mozgov is racing the clock to get in better game shape with the season opener Tuesday at the Chicago Bulls. Cavs coach David Blatt, who also directed Mozgov with the Russian National Team, knows the best way to do that is to work Mozgov.\nBut that wasn't the only goal. Mozgov's continuing basketball education seemed just as important.\n\"I'm a big guy with a big body. I learn how to use my body right, my feet,\" Mozgov said. \"You have to work on skills and the other stuff.\"\nAfter practice ended, associate head coach Tyronn Lue, assistant Larry Drew and assistant director of player development Potapenko drilled Mozgov. For much of the session, Lue held the ball and gave instructions while Mozgov was guarded by Potapenko, the Cavs' 12th overall pick in 1996 who spent over 11 years in the NBA, three with the Cavs.\nWhen Lue and Drew left, Potapenko stayed as Mozgov moved around the perimeter and shot 3-pointers for 10 more minutes.\n\"It's good to have Vitaly; we spend a lot of time. He's still waiting for me,\" Mozgov said. \"We still have to do a lot of stuff outside the court.\"\nComing to the Cavs in a January trade with Denver that sent the Nuggets two first-round picks, Mozgov scored a career-high 10.6 points and pulled down 6.9 rebounds in 45 regular-season starts. In 20 playoff games, his averages were 10.6 points and 7.3 rebounds.\nWith Kyrie Irving and Iman Shumpert out with injuries and Kevin Love coming off shoulder surgery, Blatt might have been tempted to rely more heavily on Mozgov. But Mozgov's lack of conditioning might prevent that, at least in the short term.\n\"I know him very well and I know that he's not in his best shape right now,\" Blatt said on Oct. 15. Blatt did not address the media Wednesday because he'd lost his voice because of an illness. \"He knows he's got to work hard to get himself back into the kind of physical shape that he was in last season, and I believe he will.\"\nSince then, Mozgov played in his first preseason back-to-back games Sunday and Monday, getting 28 minutes in the latter against the Dallas Mavericks.\n\"I'm happy that my body responded from the back-to-back, but I'm still not happy where my body is right now, body shape, body moves,\" Mozgov said. \"I feel like I can do much better. It's not really back.\"\nMozgov said his knee is not 100 percent, either.\n\"My knee is not like I wish it can be,\" he said. \"It is what it is. It bothers me. But we're still working on it. I think maybe, not before the first game, but in the close future we will be good.\"\nMozgov has shot only 32 3-pointers in his five years in the NBA and made six. Twenty-four of those attempts came in 2013-14 in Denver, and he sank just four. But he also wants to work on that part of his game, both from mid-range and beyond the arc.\n\"I had a coach who showed me how to do it right and how to do everything consistent,\" Mozgov said, unable to remember the man's name. \"Whatever a coach teaches you, you've got to learn it and repeat it. If you want to be a good shooter, you have to put in work in the gym.\n\"Probably I'm not going to shoot a lot of 3s during the season. But just in case, you have to be ready. I do it for myself first. If coach wants to use it, I've got no problem with it.\"\n(c)2015 Akron Beacon Journal (Akron, Ohio)\nVisit the Akron Beacon Journal (Akron, Ohio) at www.ohio.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1742068&h=Rebounding+from+surgery+not+only+purpose+of+heavy+workload+for+Cavaliers%27+Timofey+Mozgov", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1742068&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1742068"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:14:08.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
