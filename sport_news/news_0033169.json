NEW BLOOD: Khan Ahwang will return to north Queensland to link with the Northern Pride in the 2016 Intrust Super Cup. Source: News Corp Australia \nA FRACTURED back put a full stop on Khan Ahwang’s NRL aspirations, but the pointscoring machine hopes a return to his northern roots proves the catalyst for a rebirth. \nThe Mackay-born outside back will link with the Northern Pride next year, joining halfback Brayden Torpy and backrower Rajan Opetaia-Halls at the rebuilding 2014 premiers. \nAhwang will bring a potent attacking edge to Joe O’Callaghan’s squad given he topped last year’s Intrust Super Cup points charts for Burleigh ahead of Shaun Nona. \nThat landed him an NRL deal with the Titans, only for John Cartwright’s departure to see that peeled back to a train and trial basis at the start of 2015. \nThings got even worse when a routine pre-season wrestling drill at Gold Coast training left Ahwang with fractured L4 and L5 discs and a long stint on the sideline. \n“I couldn’t get up,” he said. \n“I had to stay off my feet for three months and couldn’t do weights. \n“I just had to sit pedalling on a bike \n“It just put a full stop on my footy for a while. I was finally getting to where I wanted to go with the Titans and then that happened. \n“But we all play football to play NRL. \n“Joe said he was a fan of the way I played. \n“They lost a fair few players to retirement so it’s a new start for the club and it’s a new start for me.” \nThe injury restricted Ahwang to just six matches for the Burleigh Bears last season, ultimately leaving the talented flyer on the hunt for some new opportunities. \nAn approach from the Pride and the promise of improving his game was enough to convince Ahwang to return with his young family to their northern home. \nFiancee Elizabeth Deegan is expecting the couple’s second child in January, to join son Kyrie, who turns two in December. \n“I’ve got lots of uncles and aunties in Cairns,” Ahwang said. \n“I have been away from my family pretty much since I left five years ago – I think I’ve only been back to Mackay twice. \n“We’ll stop in there on the drive through and I’m looking forward to it. \n“I know the Pride are a very good club so I can’t wait to get there.” \nLike Torpy, Ahwang’s ability to kick goals will be crucial to a Pride side that struggled in that department this year. \nAhwang scored 201 points – including 76 goals – during 2014 as he added to his growing reputation as a potent scoring threat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:15:24.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
