They voted UD the favorite in the preseason poll released Tuesday at media day in Brooklyn, N.Y. \nDayton finished 27-9 last season and tied for second with Rhode Island at 13-5, a game back of Davidson. Dayton lost in the A-10 tournament final to Virginia Commonwealth. \nThe Flyers received 12 of 27 first-place votes. They have never won the A-10 regular-season title since the league did away with divisions. \n“As with any preseason prediction, it (being the league favorite) ultimately means nothing,“ Dayton coach Archie Miller said in a statement. “Every day we are trying to improve and trying to find a chemistry on the floor with each other to put our team in a position to be at our best when it matters most.” \n“The Atlantic 10 is as strong as it’s been since I’ve been here and this league will have an incredible race to the title. When you look at the other programs in the conference and where they currently are, it is an honor to be looked at by the coaches in your league in this way. We will not take that for granted. But we also know what has to be done daily to experience any sort of success.” \nRhode Island was picked second and received eight first-place votes. Davidson followed with six first-place votes. Then it was George Washington with one first-place vote. \nPicked fifth through 14th were: VCU, Richmond, St. Joseph’s, St. Bonaventure, La Salle, Massachusetts, Duquesne, Saint Louis, George Mason and Fordham. \nDayton junior forward Kendall Pollard was named to the All-A-10 preseason third team. He was the only Flyer named to a preseason team. Kyle Davis was not named to the all-defensive team. Pierre, who’s bid to rejoin the team before Dec. 20 was rejected by a judge on Monday in Dayton, was not honored.
