I will tell them to make you a video.\" \nBenitez also defended his decision to substitute in-form striker Karim Benzema in the second half of the derby at the Calderon and said he would do the same again. \nBenitez gained a reputation for caution during stints at clubs including Valencia, Liverpool, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Napoli and his introduction of midfielder Mateo Kovacic with 13 minutes left prompted accusations Real had squandered a chance to kill off their city rivals. \nAtletico scored a deserved equaliser in the 83rd minute and substitute Jackson Martinez almost won the game late on but his shot was well saved by Real goalkeeper Keylor Navas. \n\"I would be angry too if the coach took me off,\" Benitez told Cadena Ser. \n\"But I would react and try to score two goals so they don't substitute me,\" he added. \n\"I have quite a good relationship (with Benzema). He is a great player. I have not had any problem with him.\" \nReal's next outing is a La Liga game at home to Levante on Oct. 17. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
