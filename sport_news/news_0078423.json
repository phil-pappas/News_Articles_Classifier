The late Samuel Okwaraji scored for the Super Eagles whilst the legendary Roger Milla pulled parity for Cameroon. \nBoth Nigeria and Cameroon qualified to meet again in the finals of the AFCON 1988 but this time the Indomitable Lions stopped the Super Eagles with a solitary goal from Emmanuel Kunde. \nWhat is more, Cameroon broke the heart of many a Nigerian fun at the 2000 African Nations Cup finals when they won the finals on penalty shootouts against the Super Eagles of Nigeria. Samuel Eto'o and the late Patrick Mboma gave the Indomitable Lions the lead but Nigeria pulled parity through Austin Okocha and Chuku Ndukwe's goals. \nThe Super Eagles had a sweet revenge over the Indomitable Lions at last in the 2004 Nations Cup in Tunisia. Austin Okocha's delightful free-kick and John Utaka's 73 rd minute goal was enough to give the Super Eagles a deserving win over Cameroon who had taken the lead through Samuel Eto'o. \nWhiles Cameroon looked more composed going into this friendly match, there's a growing tension surrounding Sunday Oliseh's team who lost their training match with Congo by 0-2 amid the sacking of their experience pair of hands, Victor Enyeama. \nAccording to our source, the goalkeeper reported late to camp in Belgium haven't spent few days in Nigeria to see to the burial of his late mother but his explanation did not sit well with former player and now coach of Nigeria Sunday Oliseh. \nThe coach allegedly passed a scathing comment about the goalies dead mother which Enyeama responded. Oliseh then ordered the security operatives at the camp to throw Enyeama out of the Super Eagles camp. \nIn the wake of all this confusion at the Super Eagles Camp, the Stephane Mbia-led Indomitable Lions managed to beat Belgium league leaders, KV Oostende 3-1 in a training match on Thursday. \nLikely line-ups;", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:07:31.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
