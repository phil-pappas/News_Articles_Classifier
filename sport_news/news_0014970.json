Capable of what he did last week (8-90-2) each time out.\nVikings QB Teddy Bridgewater vs. Chiefs — Facing one of the worst defensive backfields in the league and could be a nice bye week filler.\nChiefs RB Knile Davis at Vikings — It’s Davis not Charcandrick West atop the KC depth chart. The Vikings run defense allowed 146 yards and a score on the ground before the bye. Duds\nJaguars QB Blake Bortles vs. Texans — Four touchdowns last week might be an aberration and he’s not entirely healthy.\nBengals RB Jeremy Hill at Bills — Has been up and down all year. This week he’s down.\nRedskins WR Pierre Garcon at Jets — Kirk Cousins and Garcon will have a rough day with Darrelle Revis and the Jets defense.\nBrowns TE Gary Barnidge vs. Broncos — I stay away from teams playing Denver if I can.\nGiants TE Larry Donnell at Eagles — Last week’s touchdown was cool, but I don’t think he builds off it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:23:15.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
