Ozen looks to slow down Vidor 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nWhen David Suggs checked Vidor's final score last Friday, his first thought brought him to the hardwood. \n\"I never thought the score would be that high,\" Suggs said. \"It looked like the game had been played in a basketball gym.\" \nThe Pirates (2-3, 1-1) dropped 83 points on the Ganders, the most points scored by any District 22-5A team this season. \nOzen's second-year head coach is aware of the danger that awaits his defense as they head to Ivan Croak Field Friday against Vidor. The Pirates may be a one-dimensional run offense, but they run the Wing-T to perfection, most notably against Lee. Vidor racked up 703 rushing yards and five players - Blake Rowe , Trevor Duff , Kolby Humble , Haylon Leckelt and Justin Kaiser - all rushed for over 100 yards. \n\"All their backs are equally talented and dangerous,\" Suggs said. \nThe battle in the trenches will take center stage for a Vidor team that boasts the best rushing numbers in the district and an Ozen team that has struggled to stop it. \nAn undersized Panther defensive line will have to rely on assignment football and discipline, because as Suggs says, they won't be able to overpower their opponent. \n\"This game, especially, is going to be decided on the line,\" Suggs said. \"The way they (Vidor) plays offensively requires a defense to play extremely disciplined.\" \nJeff Mathews doesn't believe his team's success on the line comes from a size advantage, but from a scheme that's engraned in his teams' head. \nThe Vidor head coach though, agrees that this game will come down to who wins the battle at the line. \n\"It's huge,\" Mathews said, \"especially for us. The beauty of our scheme is we don't have to crush people. If we have an advantage it's our jobs as coaches to exploit it. When we attack though, we can't be overly concerned with what the defense is doing, it comes down to our execution.\" \nAs confident as Mathews is with his own run game, he admits to fearing the explosiveness of Ozen's offense. Panther running back Calvin Tyler Jr. leads the district with 814 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns while quarterback Josh Boyd has shown he can beat opposing defenses with his arm and feet. \n\"That Boyd kid is a special player,\" Mathews said. \"I was joking with David (Suggs) yesterday that I wouldn't mind if he got a little 24-hour bug or something to keep him out of the game.\" \nFor both teams, who are a combined 1-3 in district play, a win will go a long way in keeping them intact for one of the four playoff spots available in District 22-5A. \n\"I think both of us realize that this is the third district game and a loss would really put us behind where we want to be,\" Mathews said. \"There will be a lot of urgency on both sides and I expect a bunch of highs and lows in this one. Whoever can overcome those, will come out on top.\" \nDThompson@BeaumontEnterprise.comTwitter.com/@daveth89", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:14:42.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
