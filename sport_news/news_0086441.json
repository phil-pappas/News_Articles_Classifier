State transfer Tyler Lewis embraces 'The Butler Way' David Woods , david.woods@indystar.com 7:29 a.m. EDT October 21, 2015 A transfer from N.C. State, former McDonald's All American Tyler Lewis is eligible to play for the Bulldogs this season. (David Woods / The Star) Butler point guard Tyler Lewis addresses the media at Hinkle Fieldhouse. (Photo: David Woods) \nTake it from the new point guard. Butler will miss the old point guard. \nAlthough much is expected from transfer Tyler Lewis, he knows better than anyone the void that Alex Barlow left. More than Barlow's 8.9 points or 2.2 steals per game, he set standards for defense and toughness at a basketball program where such standards were already high. \n\"'The Butler Way' is something special to me,\" Lewis said Tuesday at Butler's media day. \"I got to learn a lot last year, sitting it out and learning a lot from Barlow last year. I mean, he sort of lived the 'Butler Way' for four years. \n\"It was just an honor to let him teach me 'The Butler Way,' and just being around a group of guys on the team who do it the right way and coaches who do it the right way.\" \nIt was Chris Holtmann, then an assistant to head coach Brandon Miller, who first reached out when Lewis announced he was transferring from North Carolina State. After Miller took medical leave, Holtmann was promoted to acting coach a year ago and then was awarded the job in January. \nLewis, 22, the first McDonald's All America high school player ever to come to Butler, said it was a \"leap of faith\" to choose the Bulldogs, but he was attracted by the tradition. He sat out last year and has two seasons of eligibility left. In 2013-14, he averaged 4.4 points and 3.8 assists for a team that reached the NCAA tournament. Butler basketball: Chrabascz and Wideman are scorers, too \nBarlow has gone on to be a video assistant for the Boston Celtics, who are coached by former Butler coach Brad Stevens. \n\"I think one of the things (Lewis) really picked up last year is he saw Alex impact the game by doing things that he hadn't seen a point guard do before — like get 50-50 balls, get deflections, stick his nose in places that sometimes he maybe didn't do at N.C. State,\" Holtmann said. \n\"That can impact the course of a possession, the course of a game. I really hope he saw that, picked that up and added that to his game. He's not the physical body that Alex is, but if he could really add that, I think that'll really help.\" \nLewis could also help someone like Kellen Dunham get more open looks. There were times in the past two seasons that defense on Dunham was suffocating. Even so, he shot 41 percent on 3-pointers and is the top returning scorer in the Big East (16.5). \nLewis shot only 23 percent (15-of-64) on 3s in his final season at N.C. State but labored in the offseason to improve that. \n\"That's one of my main goals, just to get into the lane and get a lot of paint touches,\" he said. \"Even if I don't shoot it, I can still kick it out to Kellen and open guys on the team and get a lot of easy assists that way.\" Butler driven by disappointing ending to their season \nHe said he was not at all concerned about Butler's traditionally low number of possessions per game. (Butler was 246th nationally in adjusted tempo last season, according to kenpom.com.) That feature might change anyway with reduction in the shot clock from 35 to 30 seconds. \nThat has all been superseded by Lewis' embrace of \"The Butler Way\" — which can be defined as a team-oriented and selfless approach to basketball and life. \n\"I always knew that Butler was a close community,\" he said. \"But I never really understood, until I got here, how close it really is. Our basketball team is like a family. It's a culture.\" \nCall Star reporter David Woods at (317) 444-6195. Follow him on Twitter: @DavidWoods007 .
