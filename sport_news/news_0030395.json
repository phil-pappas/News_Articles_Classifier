A focus on 10 specific observations from the weekend’s action that will help you build your fantasy team in the short and long term. \nAll set? Here goes for Week 6: 1) Guess who’s back? \nBack again. Shady’s back. Tell a friend . \nMcCoy looked the best he had all season with a strong 17-90 rushing line that featured solid burst on the outside and up the middle. \nThe fantasy production was nice, but, the eye test was most important and McCoy passed it against a solid Bengals defense. \nHe’ll draw the Jaguars next week, and, assuming that he recovers well through the week it looks like he’ll be a full go against a Jags D that has been very appetizing for opposing backs so far. Karlos Williams will make his way back to take touches eventually, but, I’m ready to lock McCoy in as an RB1 after watching him run hard against the Bengals. 2) The Bengals are so good its killing AJ Green \nOn the other side, Andy Dalton was solid yet again. He wasn’t asked to do a whole lot as Cincinnati led comfortably for much of the day, but, when he was throwing the ball it wasn’t going in the direction of his top receiver. \nDalton is spreading the ball around, and protecting it well (just two picks so far this year) and that has been a formula for success for his undefeated team. \nIt’s been bad news for Green, however. AJ had a huge game a few weeks ago but with the return of contributors Tyler Eifert and Marvin Jones (who made an incredible play to extend the ball over the goal line while in mid air this week) and Giovani Bernard doing his thing as a receiver, Dalton has been able to take what the defense gives him and isn’t concentrating targets on Green. \nHe’s just two weeks removed from a 13 target, 10 catch 200 yard outing so we won’t be calling a full mayday just yet, but, with 16 targets distributed to Jones and Eifert this week while Green posted a 7/4/36 line, he’s no longer going to be a set and forget top-end WR1. 3) Peyton looks pathetic \nYou can, however, sit and forget Peyton Manning . \nI’m intending to run through a snap by snap review of this week’s game in the early part of this week, but, what I saw on Sunday wasn’t pretty. Through a combination of poor decisions and poor arm strength, Manning threw another three picks against the Joe Haden-less Browns in Week 6 and nearly cost his team the win. He led one TD drive (and threw one the other way). \nYuck. \nHis current 7:10 TD:INT ratio is a sad swan song for a player of his caliber, but, there are no signs things are going to improve. \nIt’s not hurting anyone on the offense, of course. He’s getting the ball to Emmanuel Sanders and Demaryius Thomas just fine, but, as far as his own utility goes I’m not interested in starting Manning. \nIn other Broncos news, Ronnie Hillman was engaged early and wound up with 20 carries, topping 100 yards. It will take some time, but, he continues to push for true control of the backfield ( CJ Anderson had 11). 4) Alshon Jeffery is a game changer \nJeffery made a big splash early, and then disappeared until the 4th quarter, but, he was a huge asset for Jay Cutler . \nUnlike Green above, he’s integral to Cutler and the Chicago passing game, and, as his health improves I’m expecting double digit targets to become guaranteed. Jeffery made a number of degree of difficulty catches, running both intermediate and deep routes and looked good to go in just his second game of the season. \nJeffery fought for the ball and made a number of contested catches in double coverage, and is ready to resume his difference making role for the Bears. 5) Stefon Diggs looks like a playmaker \nWith Charles Johnson ruled out, Diggs started opposite Mike Wallace again this week. Both parties drew nine targets against a struggling Chiefs secondary, and, Diggs certainly made the most of his. \nAll told, he finished with seven receptions for 129 yards, running his two week (career) total to 216. I’m not certain that it will be enough to secure the starting job when Johnson returns, but, Diggs has absolutely improved his standing on the team’s depth chart and he warrants extended use from the Vikes, and adds from fantasy owners. \nJohnson had been struggling before his injury, and, may be best used as a third receiver to take the top off the defense, anyhow. 6) Chris Ivory is a matchup proof RB1 \nI don’t need to go into a lot of detail here… the numbers do the talking. \nThis week, those numbers included 196 total yards and a score on 23 touches. Long thought of as a back who was a poor fit for a big work load, but, here we are. \nWhile Washington was just abused by Devonta Freeman , they’re generally viewed as a solid run defense and a tough matchup for opposing backs. Not for Ivory. \nHe consistently reeled off big gains this week, including carries of 54 and 32 yards. By virtue of workload, and production, I’m starting Ivory over all but a very short list moving forward. 7) While we’re at it, Brandon Marshall gets the same treatment \nI’m starting Brandon Marshall , too. \nMarshall has done a great job of making catches in traffic, as he often does, and is contributing by extending plays as well – including his TD this week that looked like it was going to be snuffed out just after he picked up the first down. \nHe’s a legit WR1 moving forward based again on volume and his production. Rotoworld agrees: via Rotoworld.com \nI’ll admit that I wasn’t sold on Marshall in New York. Things didn’t go so well in Chicago last year, and, I had some concern over diminishing skills and attention to his craft. Further, I had concerns over his production with Geno Smith happened. \nAnd then, Smith got punched and the rest has been history. Ryan Fitzpatrick is running the Jets offense better than anyone expected, and is turning into a solid streaming option in his own right. This week, he kept the chains moving with a 73% completion percentage and is certainly doing enough to keep the offense rolling, and keep Marshall and Ivory as “1s” at their respective positions. 8) Welcome back, Martavis Bryant \nOh, and welcome to the show, Landry Jones . \nThe first half of this week’s effort was ugly, but, Bryant’s final line will play just fine. He was the most engaged Steelers’ WR throughout the day and regularly ran open. All told, he finished with an eight target, six reception, 137 yard line that looks a whole let better because he turned a short slant into an 88 yard score by reversing field and accelerating past defenders. But, that’s kind of his jam. \nAnd, as good as Jones was (relative to Vick, anyhow) he’s getting a big upgrade at QB in Ben Roethlisberger . It would be a shock if Bryant didn’t play ahead of Markus Wheaton on a regular basis and his big play ability makes him an incredibly appealing season long and DFS (GPP) play. \nAs for Week 7, it’s looking like Big Ben has a shot to take the field… if he doesn’t, I’d steer clear of all Steelers should Vick get another start, while using them comfortably with Jones. 9) Hoyer-Hopkins \nThe league’s leading target getter was at it again this week, with Brian Hoyer looking very competent under center. It hasn’t mattered for Hopkins who has been at QB this year, but, consistent play at the position could go a long way to sustaining his season long value. \nAll told, he hauled in 10 of his 15 targets this week and blew past 100 yards. He’s now topped the century mark in four straight games. \nWhile Hopkins is the first, second and third read in the Texans’ passing game, his production could be enough in the right matchup to make Hoyer a worthy play in his own right. 10) Keenan Allen should get that same workload \nAnd generally, he does. But, every now and then the team seems to forget him. \nToday, he missed almost the entire second half and still produced a 14 reception, 15 target day. He ran every route, and made a number of ‘wow’ catches including a beautiful toe tap along the side lines and a set of quick hands displayed on a goal line catch to set up a San Diego score. After his departure, the team relied heavily on Antonio Gates who nearly brought them to a tie, but, Allen was certainly their most effective weapon this week. \nHe’s been a frustrating fantasy asset, however. The 14 reception game gives him 53 on the season, but, they’ve come in bunches. Allen now has three double digit reception games this year, yet has combined for just a dozen receptions in his other three outings. He’s a must play every week, but, the hope is that he’ll be consistently used to see his true value on a regular basis. \nDid it all en route to 157 yards. \nNo Stevie", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T13:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:44:03.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
