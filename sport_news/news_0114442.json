The event was infused with music, artists and people with big ideas, and Erica shared with me the dream of opening a vintage store.\nFast-forward to the fall and she is harvesting the fruits of her labor. No longer a dream, Erica is opening her new vintage clothing store in the Starland District, naming it House of Strut.\nErica’s store boasts a 12-year collection of vintage garments partnered with new, edgy and modern basics. The opening night “reveal” party Oct. 23 will feature Dope Sandwich artist Lady Valore as emcee, DJ Blade from Dollhouse spinning through the decades, go-go dancers and more.\nI suggested that instead of a Q&A, we provide visual imagery for a taste of what she has in store. Instead of fashion models, we chose to incorporate a sample of Savannah’s female musicians to be our models.\nFilled with excitement, she added: “Our backdrop should be the Starland District.”\nShe has many reasons to choose the up-and-coming arts district as the homebase of her new venture.\n“We all have known that Starland has had potential for years, but once I couldn’t afford Broughton Street, I decided to support an emerging Savannah downtown neighborhood that was funky and diverse for a creative professional crowd. Starland is the only place I know,” she said.\n“I love the vibe here, the creativity and ethnic races merged in this neighborhood with a great sense of street style. It’s perfect!”\nMusic and fashion go hand in hand, and I believe each one needs and feeds the other. Starland has been at the center of many local preservation movements and the revitalization is finally becoming a reality. With this in mind, we gathered a dozen of our most talented female musicians from all genres: Bluegrass, heavy metal, punk and even jazz are represented.\nAlong with Samson Smith creating hair and makeup, the models were all styled by Erica and pampered like the stars they really are. Big thanks to the entire Starland community for letting us take over their spaces, including Back in the Day Bakery and Starlandia Supply.\nIt must be said, I felt lucky to have the chance to work with so many of these women.\nLike bees buzzing, we heard ideas be bounced around the room — including future collaborations. It is the creation of this patchwork-like fabric that makes our community so rich in resources and new ideas.\nWalk the talk seems to be the motto of many women today, and Erica is no different.\nShe adds that the biggest challenge for female business owners today is forming a network of support for each other.\n“I want to approach this business — and life, for that matter — by supporting other women, lifting each other up, collectively help one another reach their goals along the way.”\nErica’s hopes and wishes for House of Strut are clear.\n“Through creating this business, I have met the most amazing women who are hustling and realizing their own dreams. My hope is that I can inspire them to make positive changes in their life by chasing after their goals and looking good doing it!\n“House of Strut will be an experience where fashion, music and arts will collide,” she said. “A place to journey through fashion history, expanding their wardrobe while listening to great music of the past while pondering art. I will be hands-on, styling clients along the way, helping them layer looks and hopefully understanding more of who they are on the inside, so the outside will reflect just that.”\nOrganically, a simple story in a newspaper became the documentation of powerful, talented and strong women.\nLike a time capsule, we have captured a space and time in Savannah.\nAfter capturing the essence and energy of Starland, I encourage you to visit and support this thriving area of our small city.\nWhile you’re at it ... you have permission to strut along its sidewalks.\nAdriana Iris Boatwright is a photographer and lifestyle blogger residing in Savannah. She’s in love with the oaks, the arts and the people in the city. Go to www.adrianairis.com.\nIF YOU GO\nWhat: House of Strut grand opening party\nWhen: 5-10 p.m. Oct. 23\nWhere: House of Strut, 17 W. 41st St.\nCost: Free\nInfo: www.houseofstrut.com\nMUSICIAN MODELS SHOW OFF THEIR STYLES\nKRISTIN KING\nFashion inspiration: Depending on the outing/event, I like to keep things simple with clean lines — definitely err on the “classics” side.\nCan’t live without: Board shorts. Sorry, I know that’s not fashionable, but I don’t go kiteboarding without them.\nAdvice to young women in music: Figure out what it is specifically about music that brings you the greatest sense of excitement and joy, then try to do that specific thing as much as possible. If you can find a way to align your heart’s delight with your daily work, and continue to grow while doing so, then you are on the right path.\nRACHAEL SHANER\nFashion inspiration: Annie Oakley meets Stevie Nicks.\nCan’t live without: A well-worn bass and my Frye Harness boots.\nAdvice to young women in music: Anything relevant. We are trying to focus in female empowerment. Empowerment isn’t achieved by taking away power from others. Take vocal lessons, pay your dues and get your heart broken 100 times, or at least once.\nCatch her live: 8 p.m. Oct. 24 at The Ordinary Pub; 6 p.m. Oct. 25 at Rocks on the Roof; 8 p.m. Oct. 26 at The Warehouse; 5 p.m. Oct. 27 at B&D Burgers on Congress Street; 9 p.m. Oct. 27 at The Ordinary Pub; and 6 p.m. Oct. 29 at The Shrimp Factory. She’ll also be leading the trio Lulu Blue at the Secret Savannah Speakeasy on Nov. 12 during the Savannah Food & Wine Festival.\nLADY VALORE\nFashion inspiration: Color means everything to me. When I’m performing, I want people to be wooed by my lyrics I spit and the bright patterns of fabric I wear. My style is ever-evolving by evoking many different decades and flavors. I love vintage thrift stores, especially House of Strut, because they help me find lost treasures in time that can become modern again. They facilitate my style, which is a bold, rainbow-colored question mark.\nCan’t live without: I have this cactus earring I wear all the time. My motto is, “I am a bright green cactus that gives color to a canvas of barren sand.” My last album was titled “Year of the Cactus.” It makes people curious and makes them want to look me up and see what I’m all about.\nAdvice to young women in music: Go to open mics and be absolutely fearless. Never stop moving forward and don’t listen to negativity. So don’t be afraid — you can do it.\nBLAKE OLMSTEAD\nFashion inspiration: “Effortlessly chic” is my mantra.\nCan’t live without: Leather jacket and/or black boots.\nAdvice to young women in music: Don’t worry about being “the best” guitarist, singer, drummer or whatever instrument you decide to play. If you’re doing what you love, it will bleed and radiate off of you and effect those around you. Whether you are doing it for yourself or for the listeners, learn to FEEL it, rather than worrying about getting everything right. There is no right or wrong. It just is. And as far as being a woman in an industry seemingly dominated by our male counterparts, I have nothing more to say about that except WHO CARES. Just do what you wanna do!\nCatch her live: With Twisty Cats at 9 p.m. Oct. 22 at The Wormhole.\nGRETA ODREZIN\nFashion inspiration: Somewhere in between Joan Jett and Exene from X.\nCan’t live without: A well-fitting pair of jeans.\nAdvice to young women in music: Don’t be afraid to try ... it’s fun if you succeed or not.\nCatch her live: With Toxic Shock at 9 p.m. Oct. 22 at The Wormhole.\nMELISSA HAGERTY\nFashion inspiration: The colors, patterns and unexpectedness of nature.\nCan’t live without: My Indiana Jones adventure hat.\nAdvice to young women in music: Music is made from the heart. The music theory behind it is just that — a theory. Your creativity has no boundaries, so have fun experimenting!\nCOLLEEN HEINE\nFashion inspiration: If I had to describe my style, I suppose I might say “effortless-rustic-modern-authentic.” Is that a style?\nCan’t live without: My Frye leather boots that I got right about the time I started gigging a lot. Those boots have played hundreds of shows with me.\nAdvice to young women in music: Be curious. Be determined. Be humble.\nCatch her live: With The Accomplices at 7 p.m. Oct. 24 at North Beach Grill.\nTARA WALTERS\nFashion inspiration: ‘ 20-’70s vintage Southern punk with a kiss of class. Inspirations are definitely Polly Maggoo, Maya Deren and Loretta Lynn.\nCan’t live without: My 1930s hand-painted Japanese kimono. I wear it everywhere, even when I sleep!\nAdvice to young women in music: Say yes. Every opportunity is a new door opened for an even greater opportunity. Play every show, even when you may not feel ready. Do it! Think simply. When you create, don’t hold back. Let your spirit spark, and femininity rocks — never hold back on who you are. Be confident in yourself, the confidence will inspire others to be confident. Stay cool; we are all in this together.\nERICA FRANKLIN\nFashion inspiration: From a rock ‘n’ roll standpoint, it would have to be Stevie Nicks! Bohemian style is a staple of rock ‘n’ roll. I’d say my personal style is a little more boho-chic.\nCan’t live without: My boots ... cowgirl boots and dresses (a lot of dresses)! They’re so easy and I almost refuse to iron things.\nAdvice to young women in music: Be patient, be kind and listen. Don’t take on any career for recognition or thanks; do it because you love it.\nCatch her live: With Wood and Steel on Nov. 6 at Dub’s Pub.\nLAURA PLEASANTS\nFashion inspiration: I look to the classics and try to avoid fads. I try to keep it classy with a little bit of edge.\nCan’t live without: Jeans.\nAdvice to young women in music: Stick to your guns and don’t let anyone bully you into a decision. Get your business done the right way the first time and don’t be afraid of trial and error. Stay true to yourself and your vision and don’t forget to have fun along the way. Music is an awesome way to communicate.\nCatch her live: With Kylesa on tour throughout the country.\nMAGGIE EVANS\nFashion inspiration: I’m most comfortable in sleeveless tops and skirts because they feel less restrictive.\nCan’t live without: Black mini skirt.\nAdvice to young women in music: Don’t rely on the novelty factor of being the only chick in the band. Know how to really play your instrument; know how to run your gear. While I think it’s fun and completely OK to emphasize your femininity and sexuality, at the end of the day, it has to be about your art and your music. Many people will underestimate your ability as a female musician, so when you are on stage, you have a responsibility to take control of your instrument and prove these people wrong!\nCatch her live: With Jackson Evans at 9 p.m. Oct. 23 and 30 at Billy’s Place and with Jody Espina Trio at 6:30 p.m. Oct. 31 at Rancho Alegre.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14821737.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14821743.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14821745.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14821748.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14821740.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14821736.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14821740.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14821747.jpg", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hr.apps.n53744379", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14821735.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14825941.jpg", "http://i.imgur.com/2Ix6dHF.png", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14821736.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14821742.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14821735.jpg", "https://bit.ly/ZyZ8mc)", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14825941.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14821749.jpg", "https://bit.ly/ZyZaur", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14821738.jpg", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dosavannah/id626862925?ls=1&mt=8", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14821747.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14821748.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14821737.jpg", "https://bit.ly/Ke006c", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14821742.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14821738.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14821746.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14821746.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14821749.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14821745.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14821743.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:04:38.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
