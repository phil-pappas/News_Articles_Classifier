The Red Raiders did just enough to beat probably the weakest team in a power-five conference. That didn't cut it for Kliff Kingsbury, who sounded more like the losing coach than the winning. Here's the Kliff's notes version of the Tech coach's post-game: Running back DeAndre Washington and the defense saved the day. Everybody else stunk it up.\"\nSaid it was good thing S Jah'Shawn Johnson got into end zone with INT \"because we probably couldn't have offensively, way we were playing.\"\n— Don Williams (@AJ_DonWilliams) October 17, 2015 Nicholas Talbot, Lubbock Avalanche-Journal: \"The Red Raiders' (5-2, 2-2 Big 12) offense kept redshirt freshman kicker Clayton Hatfield busy as the he continually had to finish off stalled Texas Tech drives. He hit three of this four attempts - his 47 yarder bounced off the crossbar, converting field goals of 30, 24 and 25 yards. Meanwhile, Kansas (0-6, 0-3) couldn't make a kick. A 52-yard field goal attempt game up more than 5 yards short as the Jayhawks' season of ineptitude continued. With 2:20 remaining in the first half, it even missed a 21-yard field goal. All together Kansas kickers Nick Bartolotta and Matthew Wyman missed three field goals and an extra point.\"\nRyan McCarthy, Kansas City Star: \"Despite struggling throughout to grab complete control, the Red Raiders made a big play when Jah'Shawn Johnson returned an interception 27 yards for a touchdown, putting Kansas down 30-20 with 4:07 remaining in the game. [Freshman quarterback Ryan] Willis showed some more progress. He completed 35 of 50 passes for 330 yards with two touchdowns and an interception. Turnovers, though, made it difficult for Kansas to stay with the Red Raiders...Although he was not as potent as usual, Texas Tech quarterback Patrick Mahomes still completed 30 of 51 passes for 359 yards and a touchdown. Zach Austin was the leading receiver for the Red Raiders with 80 yards. The afternoon's best throw came with 1:02 remaining when Mahomes threw a high arching ball to Reginald Davis, who grabbed it over a Kansas defender for a 45-yard touchdown. Even with the big yardage totals, the Kansas defense did a better job organizing its assignments and held Texas Tech well under its season average of 52.7 points per game.\"\nJake Trotter, ESPN: \"The Red Raiders aren't contenders for the playoff, so style points don't matter. They won, and in the end that is all that really counts. But if Tech is going to finish strongly, it's going to have to play way, way better than it did in Lawrence. For most of the afternoon, the offense stumbled around, and the defense failed to get off the field. It was a rather miserable performance for a team that has otherwise been sharp for most of this season. The Red Raiders have a key matchup next weekend at Oklahoma. They have plenty of work to do before traveling to Norman.\"\nThe scary part, if Kansas could kick at all, Texas Tech would be in serious trouble right now.\n— Jake Trotter (@Jake_Trotter) October 17, 2015 Twitter: @MikeDuPont_\nOn Twitter:\n @MikeDuPont_", "external_links": ["http://lubbockonline.com/filed-online/2015-10-17/williams-techs-offense-listless-30-20-win-over-kansas?v=1445141141#.ViOjcmSrSL0", "https://twitter.com/Jake_Trotter/status/655450555922255872", "https://twitter.com/MikeDuPont_", "http://lubbockonline.com/filed-online/2015-10-17/texas-tech-wins-close-win-30-20-over-kansas#.ViOh3mSrSL0", "http://www.kansascity.com/sports/college/big-12/university-of-kansas/article39606294.html", "http://espn.go.com/blog/big12/post/_/id/105142/texas-tech-survives-kansas-upset-bid-30-20", "https://twitter.com/AJ_DonWilliams/status/655483779033624576"], "published": "2015-10-18T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:11:44.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
