Last year, Wikipedia blocked one congressional IP address for 10 days because of “disruptive” edits being made by someone located in the House of Representatives. Matt Williams (third baseman) Wikipedia article edited anonymously from US House of Representatives https://t.co/cI6mIJHN6o \n— congress-edits (@congressedits) October 5, 2015 \nThere was nothing disruptive about the edit to Williams’s page. Rather than adding “Mets’ Most Valuable Manager (2015)” to his career highlights and awards or mentioning Williams’s failure to do the Babe Ruth impression he promised his team last season, the anonymous editor simply changed “is the manager for the Washington Nationals” to “was the manager of the Washington Nationals.” (Via Wikipedia ) \nDon’t let anyone ever tell you that Congress doesn’t get things done in a timely manner. When it comes to D.C. sports-related Wikipedia pages that require edits, Congress (okay, most likely a congressional staffer) is on it . \nJust last month, an anonymous user with a Congress IP address changed every instance of “Kurt” to “Kirk” on Kirk Cousins’s Wikipedia page, and another congressional IP address was tied to an edit to the “Russian Machine Never Breaks” page .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:53:17.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
