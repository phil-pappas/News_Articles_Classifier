But he's handling it as good as you can possibly handle it.\"\nMarshall has nine catches for 121 yards and two touchdowns this season. Last year, in his first year as a wide receiver, Marshall led the Ducks with 74 catches and 1,003 yards.\nDucks' Matt Lubick, Devon Allen on Byron Marshall Oregon's receivers coach Matt Lubick and receiver Devon Allen talk about Byron Marshall, who was carted off the field after an injury against Utah, about depth at the position and what's next for the receivers.\nRegardless of its length, Marshall's injury figured to be an immediate test of Oregon's vaunted depth at receiver, a position that Lubick joked he had \"eight starters\" during fall camp. The onus now falls on Dwayne Stanford, Devon Allen, Jalen Brown and Bralon Addison to fill Marshall's production.\nThere is good news on the horizon in the return of Darren Carrington, from NCAA ineligibility following a failed drug test, in time for Oregon's Oct. 10 game against Washington State.\nMarshall's loss will also shake up UO's kick return unit, where he and Addison were the Ducks' most-trusted returners. Marshall's 27.5 yards-per-return average included a long of 77 yards against the Utes.\n— Andrew Greif\nagreif@oregonian.com\n@andrewgreif", "external_links": ["http://www.csnnw.com/ducks/oregon-wr-byron-marshall-most-likely-out-season"], "published": "2015-09-30T17:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:27:36.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
