Four preseason top-10 teams are no longer ranked. Injuries to key players have been rampant. Scoring is up as long as Wake Forest is not involved. \nMichigan and Florida are back. Texas is not - yet. \nLeonard Fournette has exceeded his hype. Jeremy Johnson has not lived up to his. \nOhio State’s quarterback competition is still going. \nThe good and the bad, awesome and awful, of the first seven weeks of the season: \nMost surprising undefeated team: No. 12 Iowa. \nSure the schedule has set up nicely for Iowa’s 7-0 start, but only the most optimistic Hawkeyes fans believed that their team would be one upset in the Big Ten title game away from the College Football Playoff. Ferentz forever! \nMost disappointing team: Georgia Tech. \nAuburn, USC, Georgia and Oregon have slid from top 10 to out of the rankings and Arkansas and Tennessee went from programs on the rise to teams scarmbling to get bowl eligible. The Yellow Jackets, though, have totally tanked. After winning 11 games last season, Georgia Tech has lost five straight, four in the Atlantic Coast Conference. \nBest coaching job (head coach): Kyle Whittingham, Utah \nWhittingham lost both his offensive and defensive coordinators after last season and not only has there been no drop-off but the Utes have been even better. They just do not beat themselves. Utah is third in the nation in turnover margin at plus-12 and ninth in fewest penalties per game at 4.5. \nBest coaching job (coordinator): Brent Venables, Clemson \nMuch of the ferocious defense the Tigers fielded last season is playing in the NFL this season. Despite the departures, inexperience and less-than-ideal depth, Venables’ guys rank 13th in the nation at 4.41 yards allowed per play and fourth in tackles for loss at 9.33 per game. \nBest turnaround by a first-year coach not named Jim: Pat Narduzzi, Pittsburgh. \nJim Harbaugh (Michigan) and Jim McElwain (Florida) have received much-deserved praise for quickly getting the Wolverines and Gators back into the national conversation, but how about a little love for the former Michigan State defensive coordinator? The 25th-ranked Panthers (5-1) have almost matched last season’s win total even though star running back James Conner (knee) was lost for the season in the opener.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:52:12.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
