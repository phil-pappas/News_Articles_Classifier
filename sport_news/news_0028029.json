The Sharks improved to 3-0-0 and have outscored their opponents 12-1. Jones allowed a goal on the first shot he faced this season, but has blanked opponents for the following 178 minutes, 11 seconds. Matt Nieto and Chris Tierney each had a goal and an assist, and Joe Thornton, Mike Brown and Tomas Hertl added goals. Ovechkin missed the game because of personal reasons. The Capitals sent out a note on Twitter about 35 minutes before the game saying the Russian star would not play. They confirmed earlier in the day that the left wing did not take part in the morning skate, and coach Barry Trotz said he would be a game-time decision. Ovechkin had a goal and an assist Saturday night in Washington's season-opening victory over New Jersey. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
