We don’t want to stop now. We want to be playing on that last day.” \nDespite the sweep, the Lady Vikings were challenged in all three sets by a Winder-Barrow team that stayed in the match thanks to its front line. \n“They were a really scrappy team,” Walker said. \nNorthgate junior Katie Stanton led the way with 13 kills, while teammate Taylor Richard added 11 and finished with a double- double after adding 10 digs. \nThe duo set the tone for the Lady Vikings victories with double figures in assist. Morgan Marshall finished with 18 and Emily Dozier had 10. \nSenior middle-hitter Savannah Moore, who is headed to Troy University on a scholarship, kept Winder-Barrow off balance with eight aces and five blocks. Libero Cara Rhoad finished with 10 digs. \nNorthgate and Winder-Barrow exchanged the lead three times in the first set. \nThe Lady Vikings jumped out to a 19-14 lead on an ace by Richard, but still had to fight off one last flurry of points by the Lady Bulldogs, including cutting the lead to 24-22 late in the set before Stanton ended it with a game-ending kill. \nEach team swapped the lead in the second game of the best-of- five contest. \nAfter Northgate led by four points twice in the set, including 16-12, the Lady Bulldogs clawed their way back in the match with a 6-1 run. \nWinder-Barrow’s Tonya Osuegbu’s hard serve crashed to the floor and gave the Lady Bulldogs their first lead of the match at 18-17. \nIt wasn’t their last time ahead on the scoreboard. The Lady Bulldogs increased the lead to 22-20 a few points later. \nNorthgate fought back again, tying the contest at 22 and 23 before Richard served out the set. \nNorthgate’s dramatic second-set victory deflated the Lady Bulldogs in the final game. \nAfter scoring the first point of the final set, Winder-Barrow was out scored 3-1 and never led again. \nKills by Moore and Stanton early in the set helped Northgate put the game away. \nThe Lady Vikings increased the lead to 15-5 and held off one last surge by the Lady Bulldogs when they cut it to single digits at 24-17, but the match ended when Winder-Barrow served the ball into the net for the final point. \n“I am just so proud of the way they played and fought,” Walker said.
