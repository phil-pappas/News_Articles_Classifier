The y are identical to last year.\n\"In keeping the course routes consistent, we expect to ignite the competitive nature of runners training for (personal records) or their own Dallas Marathon event record,\" said Patrick Byerly, president of the Dallas Marathon.\nThe races will start and finish by Pioneer Plaza near the intersection of Young and Griffin streets. The courses will pass through Deep Ellum, Uptown and West Village. Runners will travel along Turtle Creek through Highland Park, hit the M Streets and then veer south at Greenville Avenue by the Granada Theatre. They'll pass through Lower Greenville to North Munger Boulevard, where the half marathoners will split from the full marathoners after 9.5 miles.\nThe half marathoners will continue south on North Munger to Columbia Avenue and return downtown.\nThe full marathoners will make their way through Lakewood, climb the \"Dolly Parton\" hills, run up and back along the west side of the White Rock Lake before hitting the Santa Fe Trail. They will rejoin the half marathoners on North Munger for the last few miles.\nBriefly: The Dallas Marathon and title relay sponsor Behringer are launching their first Suits and Sneakers Day on Wednesday. Area professionals are encouraged to wear running shoes in place of their work shoes.\n\"Dallas has one of the strongest business communities in the country,\" Bylerly said. \"Suits and Sneakers Day is a fun way for runners to share their passion with their coworkers and encourage preparation for, and participation in, race weekend.\"\nParticipants also are encouraged to share images of their \"business active\" attire on social media using #suitsandsneakers. They will then be entered to win a free spot in this year's Corporate Relay Challenge along with invitations to the pre-race VIP breakfast.\nOn Twitter:\n @DFWRunning", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/DFWRunning"], "published": "2015-10-14T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:47:03.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
