Our position has been simple: the same fundamental terms that allowed us to reach deals with distributors nationwide should serve as the basis for our deal with DISH. Rather than accepting that fair, market-based approach, DISH has refused to reach an agreement and once again is preventing its customers from accessing valued channels, even as customers continue to pay for that content.\"\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T17:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:05:28.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
