(AP Photo/David Goldman) (David Goldman) Comments \nSince his retirement in 2011, former Red Sox catcher and captain Jason Varitek has slowly been integrated into the front office. \nHe's worked as assistant to the general manager the last few seasons helping the Red Sox young catchers and providing insight in the amateur draft. \nNow CBS Sports is reporting the Seattle Mariners have interviewed Varitek for their managerial opening. \nThe 43-year-old was drafted in the first round by the Mariners in 1994, but was traded to Boston along with Derek Lowe for Heathcliff Slocumb in 1997. Varitek played his entire 15-year career in Boston. \nThe Mariners fired Lloyd McClendon by new general manager Jerry Dipoto earlier this month. Alex Cora and Tim Bogar are other interview candidates. \nRed Sox president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski had sought Dipoto for a front office position before Dipoto was hired in Seattle. \nFollow MassLive.com Red Sox beat reporter @jcmccaffrey on Twitter.
