Dipoto, a former reliever, and Servais were also teammates on the 2000 Rockies team that finished 82-80 and worked together in the Rockies organization in 2005.\nHis introductory press conference is Monday. \n\"Through the course of the 20-plus years I've known Scott, I've come to see him as one of the most complete, well balanced and inclusive baseball people in the industry,\" Dipoto said in the team's press release. \"I've been fortunate enough to call him a teammate as a player, while also having worked closely with him as an organizational leader in both Colorado and Los Angeles. He is a communicator with strong baseball acumen and leadership skills. I truly believe his strong character and career experiences as a player, coach and executive have prepared him for this opportunity.\"\nAfter Servais' playing career, the 48-year-old was a roving catching instructor for Chicago beginning in 2002, then worked as a scout for the Rockies while Dipoto was the director of player personnel in 2005. He then spent six seasons with the Rangers as the senior director of player development before Dipoto hired him as an assistant general manager for the Angels in November, 2011. \n\"I am excited and grateful for the opportunity to manage the Seattle Mariners,\" Servais said. \"It has long been my goal to manage a big league team and while I took a slightly different path than many, I am confident in my ability to lead. We have a terrific core of players and I'm looking forward to bringing in a coaching staff that will help me establish a winning culture here as we work toward putting a championship-caliber team on the field for the fans of the Northwest.\"\nHe reportedly interviewed to replace Dipoto as general manager in Anaheim, but owner Arte Moreno awarded the job to former Yankees assistant general manager Bill Eppler. Servais also recently interviewed for the San Diego Padres' manager's job. \nIn Texas, Servais was credited with helping build the Rangers into a club that won the American League Championship Series in 2010 and '11. \nA native of La Crosse, Wis., Servais went to Creighton before the Astros took him in the third round of the 1988 MLB draft.  \nHe will reportedly be joined on the Mariners' staff by Tim Bogar, who is expected to serve as bench coach after spending this season in a front-office role with the Angels. In 2014, Bogar went 14-8 as the Rangers interim manager after Ron Washington resigned. \nA disciple of Cubs manager Joe Maddon, Bogar was at one time thought of as the favorite to replace Lloyd McClendon.\nEarlier this month, Dipoto, citing differing baseball philosophies, fired McClendon rather than bring him back for the third and final year of his contract after a disappointing 76-86 season. The move continued the Mariners' recent history of constant managerial turnover. \nServais will be the club's ninth manager, including interim skippers Daren Brown and Jim Riggleman, since 2003. He is the 17th full-time skipper in team history. \nOther known candidates for the job included Triple-A Reno manager Phil Nevin, Tampa Bay Rays third base coach Charlie Montoyo and former Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:52:44.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
