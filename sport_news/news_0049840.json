I really believe the bye comes at a good time for us. It’s a good opportunity for us to improve. We have a lot of improvement to make. It’s a good opportunity to look at ourselves, refocus, and push forward. We have some guys that are a little bumped and bruised. It will be a good chance for them to get healed up, and refresh themselves as well\" \nWhat's the balance for you, where you’re getting the game-day success you want, but also needing to get better at things? \n\"The players’ goal is to put the masterpiece out there each and every time. If they play for three plays, 10 plays, 33 plays, or 63 plays. The goal is to put their best effort out there. That’s their calling card each and every time. For us as a football team, that’s our calling card. That’s our quest and we will keep refining that, and feeling good about the positives and correcting the negatives.\" \nWhat’s the best thing you’ve learned about your team through the six games so far? \n\"They have a short memory, which is good.\" \nIs that more important when they’re playing well rather than playing poorly? \n\"I think it’s both ways. They understand the process. They’re challenged by the process, and they feel good about how they are doing it. They’re challenging each other.\" \nAre you happy with how they came out in the second half yesterday? What makes them mentally tough when they come back out? \n\"They just go back, refocus, and do their jobs. You just keep trying to do it better. You’re competing with the guy across from you, and you have to execute better than the other team.\" \nYou mentioned having the bye week and having time to let some bodies heal. Is there a flip side to having this break when your momentum is so strong? \n“You tell me …” \nTalking about health and the guys who played yesterday, do you think you will have everyone back in two weeks? \n\"Yes.\" \nWhat’s the most important thing you look to accomplish during the bye week? \n\"Well, the guys have to refresh and regroup. They need to have time with their families, the important people in their lives. It’s a good opportunity for them to fellowship with teammates. We had a good day today, and we just have to keep doing that and grow closer together. That’s important. When they disperse, they make sure they get an opportunity to spend time with people who are important to them. Then, they can come back here, put their blinders on, and get focused.\" \nIt seems like you have a group of guys who understand, enjoy, and believe in the process. Is it about as good as you’ve had in that regard? \n\"The most important part of it is, do the right thing, and good things will happen. I can’t guarantee the outcome, but I can guarantee we can affect the outcome. That’s the best understanding they can have. What we’re asking you to do, and doing it together, can have a huge effect on the outcome. Hopefully, that continues to end up on the plus side for us.\" \nHow will the bye week give you an extra week to get ready for Pittsburgh in the biggest game of the regular season so far? \n\"You don’t do that in the NFL. It’s not the biggest regular season game. It’s one of 16. You don’t do that.\" \nIs it mostly about self-scouting for you this week? \n\"We analyze the things we do and what we have to do to get better. We get a chance to do that. We do that all the time, but we have a chance to spend some extra time with the players, and show them what we are talking about on a game-to-game basis.\" \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
