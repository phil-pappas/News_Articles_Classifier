The outstanding Senior Notes will be redeemed for cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

In August 2015 , the Company consummated certain exchange transactions pursuant to which the Company retired $84,983,000 of the Senior Notes in exchange for cash and shares of the Company's common stock. As a result, there is $27,517,000 in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes currently outstanding.\n\"We are pleased that we were able to consummate the exchange transactions and announce the redemption of the remaining Senior Notes,\" commented Robert K. Julian , Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \"In connection with these exchange and redemption transactions, the Company expects to incur in the second half of 2015 approximately $2.4 million of additional expense representing transaction costs as well as the acceleration of certain unamortized expenses. A substantial majority of these additional costs will be non-cash.
