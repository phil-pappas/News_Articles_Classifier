To West Monroe now bringing a 20-game winning streak into Friday night’s showdown on Don Shows Field at Rebel Stadium. \nOuachita has not won in the series since 1994 but came close in 1996 when future LSU fullback Tommy Banks made a rare appearance on defense for the Rebels and stopped the Lions from converting a two-point conversion that would have likely forced overtime. West Monroe won that game 28-26. \nNow it is up to the next generation of Rebels and Lions to make their own rivalry moment when the teams kickoff at 7 p.m. \nWest Monroe comes into the game ranked No. 2 in Class 5A with a record of (7-0, 2-0). Ouachita (4-2, 2-0) has won three of its last four games including a 46-40 overtime thriller last week over Alexandria. \n“Every group is different and we remind our kids that this is a big game for us and them too,” West Monroe coach Jerry Arledge said. “As far as I am concerned, this is the district championship. It is important to us to win district and this game is important.” \nArledge the Ouachita team has no shortage of talent. \n“They have very good skill people,” Arledge said. “They are outstanding and the coaches do a great job with scheming.” \nThe game will feature two offenses that have used balance to be successful so far this season. \nWest Monroe quarterback Robert Scott Foust has completed 58-of-102 passes for 808 yards and seven touchdowns. West Monroe has also rushed for over 2,000 yards as a team. Running back Trey Coleman leads the way with 800 yards and four touchdowns. Slade Bolden has rushed for 712 yards and team-high 10 touchdowns for the Rebels. \nWest Monroe has eight passing and eight rushing touchdowns in the past three games. \nOuachita quarterback Devion Warren has been one of the most dynamic dual-threat quarterbacks in the area this season. \nWarren has rushed for 747 yards and 10 touchdowns while throwing for 536 yards and another five touchdowns. \n“It is wise for an offense, when you have the ability, to be balanced and throw when you want to not when you have to,” Arledge said. “It can make such a difference in the running game.” \nConnect with Cody on Twitter @cfutrellTNS or via e-mail cfutrell@thenewsstar.com 11 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tnsne.ws/1LPGFug TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:53:44.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
