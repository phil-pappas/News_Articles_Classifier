Bartolo Colon relieved, and Howie Kendrick hit a grounder up the middle.\nSecond baseman Daniel Murphy flipped to Tejada, who took the throw awkwardly for an apparent force as Utley slid past the bag and slammed into him, causing Tejada to flip over as the tying run scored from third.\nTejada was put on a flatbed vehicle after an air cast was placed on his leg. The Mets said Tejada sustained a fractured right fibula. Utley was ruled safe on a video review, which determined Tejada's foot missed the bag. Utley also appeared not to touch the base.\nAdrian Gonzalez followed with a two-run double off Addison Reed and scored on Justin Turner's double.\nThere was some history between Utley and Tejada. The Mets were angered during a takeout slide by Utley during a game against Philadelphia in September 2010.\n\"It was a little late,\" then-Mets manager Jerry Manuel said. \"You've got to be ready to respond. We'll take care of it. We'll slide hard, do stuff like that.\"\nThe Dodgers' Zack Greinke (1-0) allowed two runs and five hits in seven innings. He struck out eight and walked none a night after teammate Clayton Kershaw fanned 11 while losing his fifth straight postseason game.\nKenley Jansen pitched the ninth for the save, completing a five-hitter.\nSyndergaard (0-1) gave up three runs and five hits in 6 1/3 innings. He struck out nine and walked four in following up Jacob deGrom's 13-strikeout performance in winning Game 1. Eight of Syndergaard's first 36 pitches reached 100 mph or more over the first two innings on an unseasonable 90-degree evening.\nThe action shifts to Citi Field in New York for Game 3 Monday, when Brett Anderson tries to pitch the Dodgers back into the best-of-five series against the Mets' Matt Harvey.\nYoenis Cespedes and Michael Conforto hit solo homers in the second, the latter off the right-field pole. Andre Ethier had an RBI double in the fourth.\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
