Hinch said before the game.\nReally, the Astros say it won’t faze them wherever they play the Yankees.\nWe have no fear of young players being put in this position,’’ Hinch said, “or having these big moments. They’ve handled themselves to a man with a ton of confidence, and a ton of ease.\n“You’ll see an excited team, not a scared or nervous team.’’\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:31:23.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
