He said the likelihood of getting Sullivan back this season was \"minimal.\" \nSullivan was placed on injured reserve Sept. 10 with a designation to return, so the Vikings were expecting him to be healed by midseason. Joe Berger has taken Sullivan's place in the starting lineup. \nDefensive tackle Sharrif Floyd was wearing a walking boot Monday on his injured left foot, leaving his availability in question after missing the game Sunday at Detroit. Zimmer said Floyd has some cartilage damage. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:00:28.915+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
