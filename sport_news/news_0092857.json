Phillipsburg’s Jake Hardin took 10th in 16:34. \nTurning point: The Vikings got their pack together early in the race and posted a spread of 65 seconds between their first and fifth runners, a performance that left no room for challengers. \nTop performer: Whitney surged at the end of the race to capture the individual trophy. \nWhat it means: Voorhees rules the roost, having won the Hunterdon/Warren/Sussex championship and now the conference meet.
