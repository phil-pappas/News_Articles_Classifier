Whomever the new board members are going to be, they will be able to shape policy. That has not been the case for some time.\"\nIncumbents Anne Rowe and Allegra \"Happy\" Haynes say the district still has work to do in getting more high-quality schools in every neighborhood, but their opponents, Kristi Butkovich and Robert Speth, say the district is not heading in the right direction and may be making things worse.\n\"The district's achievement gap is almost doubling. It's going the wrong direction really fast,\" said Speth, who is challenging Haynes for her at-large seat. \"It would be a wake-up call. It's about hearing what the communities want. I may get shot down, but the points will be put forth.\"\nBoard candidates supported by the teachers union, Speth, But kovich and Michael Kiley in northwest Denver, have raised more money so far. But overall, candidates have raised less than half of what was reported by this time in 2013 or 2011.\nAdvertisement Reform groups have not been as active in contributions to candidates, but a local committee, Raising Colorado, associated with Democrats for Education Reform, did report $250,000 in contributions from the New York group Education Reform Now.\nIn some ways, the issues most discussed remain familiar. Much discussion has focused on pitting support for traditional neighborhood schools against support for charter schools.\nIn northwest Denver's race, where Kiley is running against Lisa Flores, Kiley says he doesn't oppose charter schools, but opposed the idea of having one be a neighborhood school instead of a choice. Flores says some charters are the highest achieving in the district and shouldn't be demonized, but said all schools need to be better.\nMost candidates also say they want to address the high turnover of principals and teachers, and some criticize how the district has handled it so far.\nOther district initiatives that have been criticized include the creation of enrollment zones , and co-locating schools within buildings, including one at Lincoln High School .\nThe board elected Nov. 3 will oversee the continuing implementation of the district's master plan to have at least 80 percent of students in each neighborhood in high- performing schools. The district is also renegotiating ProComp, the district's pay for performance plan and trying out changes to give schools more flexibility.\n\"My colleagues and I have worked really hard in the creation of the Denver Plan 2020 to ensure that every child has access to a high-quality school,\" Rowe said. \"I think this year's election for the school board is incredibly important.\"\nYesenia Robles: 303-954-1372, yrobles@denverpost.com or @yeseniarobles\nDps board of education candidates\nDistrict 1:\nKristi Butkovich executive director of the Denver Alliance for Public Education\nMoney raised: $29,256.42\nLargest donors: DCTA Fund, $21,000; Kristi Butkovich, $1,350.\nTop priorities: Putting kids first.
