No one actually asked that question for this week’s mailbag, but I figured I’d address that non-story up front. Now let’s get to a heavy load of questions as MSU at Michigan looms: \n* I have been thinking about the game this weekend and decided to analyze the teams that both have played. If you look at strictly offensive rankings (passing and rushing) for each opponent, one can clearly see that U-M has played primarily rushing teams, whereas MSU has played more “balanced” teams. As per ESPN.com, below are the offensive rankings for both UM and MSU opponents: \n(NOTE: This is where I struggle to get James’ info box to fit and read clearly, but I can tell you that the average ranks for U-M opponents are 85.3 for passing offense and 52.2 for rushing offense, while the averages for MSU opponents are 69 for passing and 59.5 for rushing). \nI think that this relative disparity in opponents would get many clicks and spark a lively debate. This data clearly shows that U-M has played poor passing teams, which clearly hinders the ability of a team to mount any sort of comeback. MSU, on the other hand, appears to have played higher caliber offenses. Saturday should be a good one!!! \nJames in Aurora, Colo. \nInteresting stats, James, not that the offensive numbers for MSU opponents are spectacular or anything. But the numbers do support the one cause for pause when assessing Michigan’s defense so far – other than Utah’s Travis Wilson in its season-opening loss, that defense has not seen an accomplished veteran quarterback this season. Accomplished veteran quarterback No. 2 arrives Saturday in the form of Connor Cook. Which side are you on? \nI’m no Pat “Stats are for losers” Narduzzi, but I am going to trust my eyes more than any numbers. And they tell me this Michigan defense is elite. Cook and his receivers – and protection – will have to be great Saturday to puncture it. \n* Joe, I listened to most of the Spartan Speak podcast (great job) and unless I missed it, I did not hear much talk about the possibility of Mark Dantonio and the chip-on-the-shoulder mentality being a factor in getting MSU up for this game and getting out of Ann Arbor with a victory. Do you feel this could play a role, or do you think we are just too beat up to have a shot this week? While I have felt all year that MSU has underperformed, I am still holding out hope that the Michigan hype that they have had to deal with since the Jim Harbaugh hire could be enough to get them over the hump. Playing sports psychologist here, but all year MSU has been the favorite I almost feel has played tight. Now that the Spartans are the underdogs they can play loose and shock the world! \nJoe \nFirst of all, thanks for listening (to most of it)! We didn’t get much into that, maybe because it’s obviously a factor this week. It was always going to be a factor, just because of the #Harbsteria that started while MSU was preparing for the Cotton Bowl and never really waned. It’s a bigger factor considering the drop in the polls, the betting line, the (well-earned) attention Michigan is receiving for its start, etc. \nBut let’s say none of that existed. Michigan hired Greg Schiano or something. The Spartans were heavily favored and getting all the pub. No former Michigan players, such as Braylon Edwards, were throwing “little brother” around and predicting an easy win for the Wolverines. I still think MSU would be as fired up and prepared for this game as humanly possible. I think that’s a fair assumption every time at this point. The question I have is whether MSU has the tangibles to win this game. \n* I was really happy about the win on Saturday against Rutgers. It was a program win. It makes me think about how good the program is now, when people continue to complain about being undefeated but not winning overwhelmingly against inferior opponents. MSU took Rutgers’ best shot and came out victorious. It was a night game with a great crowd, and Leonte Carroo (future pro) played his best game of the year after being suspended. Ten years ago under the same circumstances, MSU is 3-3 with three gut-wrenching losses in the last minutes to Oregon, Purdue and Rutgers. I am excited for the Michigan game. Dantonio will have his team ready. He always has against Michigan. How does MSU attack Michigan offensively? How does MSU get more rushing yards than Michigan? We all know that is the key statistic. What does MSU need to do on defense other than not allow big plays because of missed assignments? \nBrad in Bloomfield Hills \nSee, just when you think you’re going to receive a bunch of panicked, resigned emails from fans, you get perspective instead. Good points, Brad. And to answer your questions at first blush, I personally think MSU has to pass to run in this game. Get Connor Cook going early, some short passing, take some shots, make Michigan’s safeties think twice about living at the line. Michigan is going to be primed to stop the run and does it as well as anyone in the game right now. An offensive line I expect to have Jack Conklin but not Jack Allen has to play its best game. And winning the rushing battle obviously means making Michigan one-dimensional on offense. \nThat’s where my perception of these teams has changed the most in the past few weeks. I’m very impressed with how Michigan’s offensive line has improved this season. And I’m not sure MSU’s defense can stand up to that, not after watching what Purdue and Rutgers were able to get done at the Spartans’ expense. MSU’s defensive line has been making plays, but can it be a brick wall. Can MSU’s linebackers win consistently in a thump-a-thon? And then can MSU’s safeties take proper angles and make tackles in space? A lot of things the Spartans haven’t been doing will have to happen Saturday for them to win. \n* OK Joe, help me out a little here. Which football god have the Spartans angered so great as to extract this insane injury retribution? Another game, another three players helped off. Should I pull a Cerrano and go out and get a chicken or what? A 6-0 record is an amazing feat considering that nine starters were out, a clearly hobbled right tackle by trade playing left tackle, a converted defensive lineman at left guard, a left guard playing center, a right guard playing right tackle....whew. \nEd \nJust don’t anger Jobu, Ed. The Spartans will be playing 15 true freshmen by November at this rate. \n* Here’s a question for you and you’ve probably already seen it many times. Do you think that the MSU coaching staff has three different playbooks? One is for Michigan, one is for Ohio State and the other is titled ‘Vanilla?’ It seems like we’ve seen no flashy plays through six weeks and with the experience this team has it should be easy to implement complex plays and assignments. I know the injury thing plays a role but in most cases the twos and threes have been around for a while and should know the playbook. Dantonio seems like he would be a pretty good card player and it seems like play calling has been very plain all year on both sides of the ball. The shovel pass this week was the first time I can remember seeing a play that wasn’t in the vanilla playbook. I have a feeling we will see offensive and defensive sets and plays this week that have not been used so far, at least I hope so. Have we only used the minimum plays to win the first six games in an attempt to surprise UM and OSU? \nSpartan in Bama \nYes, Ron, I have seen this many times. And I say the same thing every time: This idea is overblown. In every game, every team uses a fraction of its playbook. Those plays are practiced all week and make up the game plan. Much of what MSU has done through six games will be on display Saturday. Will there be different looks and new plays? Of course. Same for Michigan. Will MSU have a trick play or two ready? I’m sure. You can say MSU has been “vanilla” in terms of no trick plays. But MSU’s offensive and defensive identities are not going to change overnight. The Spartans need great plans and play calling and execution on both sides. They’ll try to break tendencies and confuse as much as possible. But at the core, they’ll be doing the same things. \n*Why are we always choosing to defer to the second half? To me our best unit has been our offense and I would think we would want them on the field first. I know in the past we have always done this with a strong defense, which we just don't seem to have this year. Doesn't it make sense to try and put points on the board first? \nTyler in Dallas \nI got a few questions to this effect. First of all, how about MSU’s amazing coin-toss success, eh? No one in the national media mentions that when they disrespect the Spartans! Assuming that continues, I expect Dantonio to keep deferring. I think he still prefers to start with field position. \n* What are the odds a Michigan State offensive line will be able to hold up against the Michigan front seven even if Kieler, Conklin and Allen play? With Kieler severely hampered, the line looked disoriented at times against Rutgers in pass protection. And will Conklin's return be similar to Kieler's -- far from full strength and just filling a hole as a result of a lack of other options? The offensive line giving Cook the time to throw seems to be one of the keys to the game for MSU. \nPaul in Howell \nPaul, I don’t have a biological crystal ball so I can’t answer the question on Conklin. But he’s expected to play. And I’d expect Kieler to give it a go again, and possibly be better with another week of healing. You put Kieler at his best position, right tackle, and that allows Donavon Clark to go to his best position, right guard. A 75% Conklin at left tackle is still better than a lot of left tackles. I’d look for Brian Allen to start at center (to repeat, I’m speculating that the injury Allen sustained late Saturday will keep him from playing Saturday), and then at left guard there are three options with some level of experience – Benny McGowan, Brandon Clemons, David Beedle. You know what that is? The best MSU offensive line in a few weeks. I don’t know if it’s good enough to handle Michigan’s front seven, but it would have a chance. And this is when you look at the replay of Jack Allen taking that late shot to the ankle from Rutgers defensive tackle Julian Pinnix-Odrick (on two straight plays, actually) and really wonder what might have been. \n* The defensive alignments and assignments have been, I believe, an issue. I think the players are the players, but are the calls being called by Harlon Barnett putting players in the best position scheme-wise? I can't recall so many blown coverages in many years. How much input does Dantonio have during games on defensive play calling? \nJohn B \nFor starters, John, I’ve got to address “the players are the players.” The players on MSU’s defense right now are not the same players who made up some of the best defenses in the country from 2011-13. The players on this defense right now aren’t even the players who were supposed to make up this defense – Ed Davis, Vayante Copeland and RJ Williamson would certainly make a difference. That’s not to say everything that has gone wrong on defense for MSU is all on them. The job of coaches is to enable players to succeed, and there have obviously been some things that haven’t worked. When a coverage is blown to the point that everyone can see it, that means a player has made a mistake on the field. Still, it’s on the guys making the big bucks to fix that. As for Dantonio’s input, there’s no doubt he jumps in on both sides of the ball at times, but he prefers to delegate and let his coaches do the job. \nAnd finally, a level-headed reaction to my Monday column wondering if the Spartans can stay close enough to sneak this game away in Ann Arbor. \n* Joe--- or should I call you Bo or Jimmy?? Terrible article about the upcoming game against your favorite team. I always think our beat writer should at least be objective, and then I remember you work for the Free Press of Ann Arbor. Your piece today is absolutely lousy -- I guess we don't need to show up since the messiah has arrived. But I do have to thank you for throwing it out there so early -- now I will NOT read any more of your \"stuff\"\" this week -- no need to. If I were Dantonio I would also not take any questions from you until after we win on Saturday. One thing that never changes is how the Free Press covers MSU. I also think it says a lot when Drew Sharp is the most objective Detroit writer around!!! Who would have ever thought that would happen? Have a good week -- I know all of us Spartans in Michigan will!! \nBill in Caledonia \nI apologize, Bill, for writing what I actually think and not lying to make you feel better about your favorite team. I’ll let you know if Dantonio refuses to answer my questions -- if my khakis shopping spree ends soon enough to attend the presser! 17 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1Ls2S1n TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:40:17.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
