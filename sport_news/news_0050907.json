Fans should give him a stirring ovation because Babcock had a .649 winning percentage in 10 years in Detroit. He put his heart and every ounce of energy he had into the team.\nAdChoices But the truth is the Red Wings can live without him. Here is why it isn't the end of the Red Wings' world that Babcock left:\n1. Red Wings are skilled : This Detroit roster, with younger prospects now merging with proven veterans, is impressive, no matter who coaches it.\nDon’t forget that the Red Wings pushed the Tampa Bay Lightning, the Eastern Conference champions, to a Game 7 last spring in the first round. The Detroit organization has enough talent to be a true contender. If the goaltending is strong, the Red Wings can be a factor in the playoffs.\n2. Quality understudy : The Red Wings sensed they could lose Babcock and they made sure they had Jeff Blashill waiting in the American League to take his place.\nBlashill was considered one of the best coaching prospects outside the NHL. He’s similar to Tampa Bay's Jon Cooper. He’s modern in his approach, and he has a strong rapport with his players. The Red Wings gave Blashill a hefty salary in the AHL to keep him from jumping to another NHL team. Blashill, a native Detroiter, was willing to stay longer in the minors for a chance to land his dream.\nIt was a well-conceived plan by the Red Wings and a small gamble that paid off big for Blashill.\n3. Clean slate for one and all : Babcock had been with the Red Wings for decade, and he had fully developed opinions about the organization’s veterans and prospects.\nOthers within the organization didn’t always agree with Babcock’s assessments. Now everyone has a second chance to make a first impression. The franchise seems re-energized because Blashill is taking a fresh look at everybody.\nFor example, defenseman Jakub Kindl was not a Babcock favorite. It seems as if Blashill is going to give him a chance to show what he can do. There are a few players on the roster who might get more chances now. Many of the younger Red Wings helped Blashill win an American Hockey League championship.\n4. Added motivation : No one disputes that Babcock is an exceptional coach. His resume speaks for itself. But these Red Wings would like to show everyone that their long playoff run wasn’t all Babcock’s doing.\nThis is a prideful Detroit group and it would say much about the Red Wings if they have even more success without Babcock than they had with him.\n5. GM Ken Holland still in charge . When you give a coach an eight-year contract, you essentially give him the hammer. With $50 million coming to him, Babcock is fire-proof.\nHolland respected Babcock unquestionably. He said many times that Babcock’s ability to prepare his teams to play was second to none. But that doesn’t mean it was easy for Holland to deal with Babcock every day. Had Detroit matched Toronto’s offer, the power structure in Detroit would have been different.\n6. Too much tradition to fail : Two years ago, USA TODAY Sports surveyed 28 NHL stars and more than 46% said Babcock was the NHL’s top coach.\nBut here’s the thing: The Red Wings qualified for the playoffs for 14 consecutive seasons before Babcock arrived. Plus, they have long owned a reputation of drafting well and developing talent. There is a tradition of success in Detroit that likely will go on without Babcock.\n7. Time for a change : If you look around the NHL, coaches don’t stay long in one place. Hockey is an emotional game. Babcock is a confrontational coach. There was weariness in the Detroit dressing room.\nThis may have worked out well for all involved. Babcock, a proud Canadian, coaches an iconic franchise. Detroit players get a fresh face behind the bench.\n8. Wings didn’t die after Bowman retired : Scotty Bowman is the greatest coach in NHL history, and after he retired in 2002, the Red Wings didn’t fold the team. They soldiered on. Since the Red Wings were able to thrive without Bowman, they can do the same without Babcock.\nPHOTOS: October's stars: Best performances of the month\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:08:10.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
