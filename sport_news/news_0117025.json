McCoy spoke about the setback for the first time on Friday. He said he was making progress in his recovery from the left hamstring injury before Buffalo’s Week 3 game against the Miami Dolphins, but hurt it again on 24 September. McCoy attempted to play through the injury in Buffalo’s 41-14 win over the Dolphins but ran for just 16 yards on 11 carries. “After (Week 2 against New England) I was getting better, feeling better,” McCoy said. “And then that Thursday I kind of hurt it again and that’s where it went wrong. I tried to really push it. I guess I messed something up.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T10:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:27:47.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
