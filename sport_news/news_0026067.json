I’m happy for him, honestly, that he’s going to have the opportunity to show he still has it.” \nOn Sunday, Smith was really happy about this: Wright was often covering him in the 49ers’ 25-20 win over Baltimore at Levi’s Stadium. \nEight days after the 49ers granted his release, and five days after the Ravens signed him, Wright was pressed into service and burned on a 76-yard, second-quarter touchdown pass from Colin Kaepernick to Smith. \nIt was part of a dreadful 2015 debut for Wright, who fell down on a 21-yard touchdown from Kaepernick to Quinton Patton in the fourth quarter, allowed an 18-yard completion to Smith and was flagged for holding wideout Anquan Boldin . \nSmith finished with three catches for 98 yards and his 76-yard touchdown was the longest reception of his five-year career. It was part of a huge day for both Smith and Boldin (5 catches, 102 yards), ex-Ravens who played for the winning side in Baltimore’s 34-31 victory over the 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII 30 months ago. \nIn the first meaningful game between the teams since that game in New Orleans, Smith and Boldin combined for eight catches and 198 yards and helped the 49ers (2-4) snap a four-game losing streak. \nKaepernick (16 of 27, 340 yards, 2 TDs) took advantage of a pass defense that ranked 25th in the NFL and figured to be worse Sunday. The Ravens didn’t have two of their top three cornerbacks and lost safety Kendrick Lewis to a knee injury in the third quarter. \nThe attrition helps explains why Kaepernick threw for a career-high 225 yards in the first half and why Wright was playing a few days after his arrival. Wright, 28, signed a one-year, $1.5 million guaranteed deal with the 49ers in March, but was released after he was inactive for the first four games. \nWith the 49ers leading 19-13 in the fourth quarter, Wright fell down in the middle of the field and his slip left Patton all alone for the first touchdown of his three-year career with 10:52 left. \nThe 49ers’ two-point conversion failed and the Ravens (1-5) did their best to add a bit of suspense. Baltimore embarked on a 14-play, 80-yard march that was capped by Joe Flacco ’s two-yard pass to Kamar Aiken that shaved the deficit to 25-20 with 5:14 remaining. \nThe Ravens got the ball back with no timeouts at their own 20-yard line with 1:06 left. Flacco, the MVP of Super Bowl XLVII , had a chance to deliver another dagger to the 49ers, but his 35-yard heave into the end zone fell incomplete as time expired. \nEric Branch is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
