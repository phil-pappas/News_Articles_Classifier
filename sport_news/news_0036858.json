(Photo: AP) New Delhi : The two troubled Indian Premier League franchises Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals can breathe easy as BCCI members may not push for their termination when the Working Committee meeting chaired by newly-appointed president Shashank Manohar takes place in Mumbai on Sunday.\n\"The agenda of this upcoming Working Committee meeting is same as it was for the one that was called off in Kolkata, last August. The main thing on the agenda will be discussion on the IPL Working Group's report about the way forward for IPL-9. As of now, there is little or you can say no chance of termination for Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals,\" a top BCCI and IPL Governing Council member told PTI on Friday.\nThe IPL Working Group had suggested fresh bidding for two new teams to make it an eight-team IPL which is a must from the perspective of broadcasters and sponsors.\nIt was also suggested that after CSK and RR complete their two-year suspension period as per Supreme Court- appointed Lodha Committee's verdict, they will be re-inducted into the cash-rich league to make it a 10-team affair.\n\"Since we had decided to implement Lodha Committee's report in toto, we don't find any need to supercede them and decide on a fresh quantum of punishment,\" the official said.\nFor Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA) is likely to be represented by P S Raman in the meeting which will also discuss on Pepsi's intent to pull out as title sponsor of the Indian Premier League. N Srinivasan will stay away from the meeting.\n\"PS Raman is scheduled to attend the meeting and in case he has some prior commitments, someone else will attend the meeting,\" TNCA secretary Kashi Viswanathan said.\nIt will be the final working committee meeting where the annual accounts will be passed and the date of the Annual General Meeting will also be decided.\nBCCI president Manohar has already said that the board would not be vindictive towards any of its member .\nAfter BCCI president's declaration, Srinivasan withdrew the perjury case filed against secretary Anurag Thakur while the Board is still represented at the ICC Board meetings by the Tamil Nadu strongman.\n Cricket Chennai Super Kings Rajasthan Royals BCCI Working Committee Also Read BCCI may ask Dhoni, former cricketers to manage CSK, RR for 2 years Shashank Manohar to go after N Srinivasan’s men?
