The Southeastern Conference announced its preseason poll and all-conference team on October 20, as voted on by a panel of both SEC and national media members. \nEarning a spot on the six-member Preseason All-SEC team was junior guard Makayla Epps, marking the first time that the Wildcats landed a player on the media-chosen team since the 2013 preseason poll, when DeNesha Stallworth earned the distinction. \nEpps was named to the All-SEC First Team following a 2014-15 season that saw her earn SEC postseason honors. The Lebanon, Ky., native assumed the point guard role after Janee Thompson suffered a season-ending leg injury last season. During the regular season, Epps averaged a team-high 14.3 points per game, which ranked eighth in the SEC. \nWithin league action, she was atop the SEC with 15.1 ppg and had the second-highest field goal percentage at a .413 clip. Additionally, she was eighth in assists (2.9), ninth in free throw percentage (.750), and sixth in minutes played (33.6). Epps earned a spot on the prestigious Nancy Lieberman Award watch list, given annually to the nationâ€™s top point guard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:54:24.465+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
