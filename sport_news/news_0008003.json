On Saturday afternoon, the Lady Tribe made the defending Class 4A state champions sweat a bit in the third set of the sectional opener. \nThat is progress. \nAnderson (9-20) saw its season end with a 3-0 (25-13, 25-12, 25-17) loss against Carmel (21-11), but first-year coach Kelli Marchello was happy with the fight she saw from the Indians. \n\"I'm so proud of them,\" Marchello said. \"From the beginning of the season to playing Carmel like that? We weren't even on the radar, or weren't supposed to be. We are now.\" \nThe Lady Tribe's most impressive stretch began with a 6-3 deficit in the third set. Megan Moran served three consecutive aces -- and finished with four overall -- to tie the score, and Lauren McGinnis and McKenzie Albano teamed on a block to put Anderson ahead. \nCarmel's Alexandria Hicks briefly staunched the bleeding with a kill to again tie the score, but Albano responded with a kill of her own and the Lady Tribe was in front 8-7. \nAnderson appeared to extend its lead on a kill by Allison Smitherman, but after a consultation, the officials ruled the Indians had made an illegal replacement and awarded the point to the Greyhounds. \nCarmel gave the lead back with a service error, and April Stiers teamed with Smitherman on a block to extend the advantage. Wiley Hopkins ended the run with a kill, and Anderson was in front 11-8. \nThe Greyhounds rallied with four straight points, but a Carmel error and an ace by Stiers put the Indians in front again at 13-12. Carmel responded with three straight points, and the Lady Tribe used a timeout. \nThe Greyhounds came out of the break with a net violation and consecutive errors, and Anderson took its final lead at 16-15. \nCarmel again ran off three straight points before another kill by Hopkins pulled the Indians within 18-17. From there, the Greyhounds revealed their championship pedigree. Carly Cason, who had a match-high 15 kills, ended the rally and the match with a strong kill over the middle. \n\"We are a rally system team,\" Marchello said. \"We don't have the hitters to just put it down on one swing. We want to place the ball and make them make plays.\" \nStiers and Hopkins led the Lady Tribe with four kills each. \nBonnie Bostic had 10 kills for Carmel, and Kay Lesure added five. \nThe Indians graduate four seniors -- Smitherman, Stiers, Hopkins and Alexa Douglas -- but hope to continue the program's growth next year. \n\"This was definitely a starting point,\" Marchello said. \"You have to start somewhere.\" Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T22:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:19:42.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
