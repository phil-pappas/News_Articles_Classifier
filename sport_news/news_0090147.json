Sunrise Mountain led 14-3 at the half before pouring it on the in the second.\nQuarterback Stephen Wright completed 8-of-13 passes for 167 yards and three touchdowns.\nFreshman receiver Xavier Kyles was Wright’s favorite target, racking up 114 yards and two receiving touchdowns.\nHe wasn’t the only underclassman to have a big night. Sophomore Te’andre Love caught two passes for 45 yards, and found the end zone on both.\n“It’s not surprising to us,” Sawyers said. “Our kids expected this to happen the way we worked in the offseason. It’s been a long time coming. This school has had talent and for whatever reason just couldn’t put it together. Now these kids can finally be proud of their program.”\nThe win brings Sunrise Mountain to 2-2 in league play, behind only Desert Pines and Chaparral in the Sunrise division.\nJesse Granger 259-8814 or jesse.granger@lasvegassun.com .
