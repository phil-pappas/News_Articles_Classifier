As Lamar begins a new chapter in his road to recovery, PLEASE continue to uplift him and the family in prayer.\"The statement continued, \"He continues to make miraculous progress, taking a few steps in Los Angeles. We couldn't be more overjoyed! We realize Lamar's continued improvement will not be easy, however his unrelenting strength and faith in God will pull him through.\"The former NBA star, 35, has been in the hospital since last Tuesday after being found unresponsive at the Love Ranch in Crystal, Nev. When rescuers arrived at the brothel, Odom was \"unconscious but breathing,\" Nye County Sheriff Sharon Wehrly told reporters last week. Police also said that a Love Ranch worker told 911 dispatchers that the former basketball player had been using cocaine and sexual enhancement drugs in the days before the incident.Last Friday Odom opened his eyes. Since then, his family has been updating fans, saying just Monday that everyday he's \"getting stronger.\"\"Lamar has always been blessed with a tenacious, fighting spirit, overcoming insurmountable obstacles to achieve the impossible. These past few days have been no different,\" JaNean Mercer, Odom's aunt, said Monday in a statement. \"He is defying the odds in his toughest battle to date with God's grace. Each day Lamar is getting stronger and reaching significant milestones in his recovery. We are committed to remaining by his side as a family for our champion, who we love immensely.\"After the incident, Odom first received treatment at Pahrump's Desert View Hospital, then was transferred to Sunrise Hospital. He's now in Los Angeles, according to family.TV reality star Khloe Kardashian married Odom in 2009, but filed for divorce four years later. Both parties signed the divorce papers earlier this year.Copyright   Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 11:10AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:28:15.793+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
