Windsor's Storm Fox is also directly behind Tapia with three sacks, in second. \nEither Longmont's offense, which yields 44.5 points per game, or Windsor's defense, which allows 7.5, will prove to be the greater force. \nHome field not exactly an advantage: In their last three matchups, both teams have proved playing at home doesn't guarantee a win when they meet. \nThe Wizards spoiled the Trojans' homecoming in their first meeting in 2012. \nLongmont then returned the favor twice in a row at Dudley Field, most recently in a comeback 33-32 win last season. \nThe road team has gone 3-0 since 2012, although location shouldn't be much of a factor for squads of this caliber. \nFor live game updates, follow sports reporter Quentin Sickafoose at twitter.com/QSickafoose. 6 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://noconow.co/1RDqyki TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:44:52.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
