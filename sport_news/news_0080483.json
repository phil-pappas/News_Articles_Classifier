Senior vice president Angel Maria Villar is also waiting to discover if he’ll be found guilty of obstructing an investigation. \nUEFA also charged Ukraine’s Dynamo Kiev for racist behavior after black fans were reportedly attacked during the team’s Champions League match against English Premier League champion Chelsea. \nUEFA received reports from anti-discrimination group Fare that four men were attacked by other Dynamo fans in a home section of the Olympic Stadium at the 0-0 draw with Chelsea on Tuesday. \nBefore the match, UEFA promoted its “No To Racism” project which it runs with Fare. \nUEFA says its disciplinary committee will judge the case next Tuesday. \nLast season, UEFA sanctioned Dynamo for racist behavior by fans during a Europa League round-of-16 match against another Premier League club Everton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:58:18.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
