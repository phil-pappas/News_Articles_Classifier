This week we’re headed to Pecos Park to check in on one of our most successful football programs in the entire State! \nThe SEV Cadet Thunder Football team is a group of 9, 10 & 11 year olds who are on an 18-game win streak. A win streak that dates back, well, 18 games! And that’s a long win streak! \nBut the best part of playing with this team isn’t necessarily the winning. Here’s Matty’s take on the team. “It’s really fun! You get to hit people, have some fun and it’s really all about the team. KJ agrees with Matty. “Definitely my favorite part would be just coming out, trying my best and the coaches always make it fun.” \nAnd the coaches are also teaching a few life lessons along the way. KJ says, “Be respectful to people, and always be a leader for people in your community. Also to just be a good leader. \nOh, but there is that part of football that we all seem to love. Just ask Killer Cole. “They call me that because I hit people really hard.” \nThey obviously love playing with each other, but to these kids, it’s clearly more than that! Just take it from “Do-Right”! \n“They’re just like family to me. They stand with me when I need them and even if they don‘t, I’ll still have their backs no matter what.” \nCongratulations Cadet Thunder Football, you’re this week’s Small Stars! \n“Do-Right” says, Off the field I learned not to ever give up in life and on the field I learned a lot of things from them.” \nCopyright 2015 Scripps Media, Inc.
