The field house will be remodeled, keeping the existing brick foundation, with improvements to the snack shack downstairs, a new meeting room and handicap accessible restrooms. Improvements to the infrastructure of the park and fields will also be undertaken. \nContributions from the community, businesses and contractors along with donations of labor and materials are helping with the funds, but donations are still being accepted. The completion date is targeted for early April.
