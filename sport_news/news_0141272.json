Only this time when Stockton Tigres catcher Aaron Rawley tossed the ball back to the pitcher, it sailed high to the left, into the outfield. That's how Club Mexico captured its third Cal-Mex League baseball championship in four years, on a bases-loaded error in the 12th inning, to beat the Tigres 3-2 Sunday at Stribley Park. \"We were happy to win, but it's unfortunate it had to come that way,\" Club Mexico manager Jim Ryan said. \"It was a hard-fought battle. We had to take advantage of the mistakes they gave us.\" It was an astonishing way for the day to end. The Tigres, looking for their first title in the league's 60-year history, forced a Game 3 by beating Club Mexico 5-2 in the opener. They had lost to Club Mexico 2-1, also due to a throwing error, in Saturday's series opener. While it seemed like an unjust way to end a championship series, Rawley was forthright about the turn of events. \"It is a fitting end, though,\" Rawley said. \"We lost a lot of games that way this year. You can't keep making mental mistakes against a good team like that.\" In the bottom of he 12th, Steve Glacier and Joe Elias hit back-to-back singles. Bobby Glacier grounded out and Ryan was walked intentionally to set up a force play. With pinch hitter Rafael Cardoza at the plate, Steve Glacier said he was honed in on the routine back-and-fourth of Rawley and relief pitcher Robert Covarrubias. Before the day began, Club Mexico's team meeting focused on what it takes to be a champion. Specifically, it was discussed how \"champions pay attention.\" The message was something Glacier thought of standing on third. The errant throw still didn't register right away. \"I saw the pitcher's head go down and I saw the ball go by him,\" Glacier said. \"It took me a second to realize what happened. I wanted to make sure the ball got by him before I committed.\" But Cardoza was screaming \"Score, score, score!\" from home. He's the first one Glacier grabbed when he crossed the plate as their teammates streamed onto the field from the first-base dugout. Both games were marked by exceptional defense. In the first game, Club Mexico left fielder Anthony Galindo threw out two consecutive runners at the plate to end the fourth. The Tigres' Zack Devalle picked off a runner at first base in the second inning. In the deciding game, Ryan ended the top of the 10th with a diving snag of Chuck Patton's line drive to third. The play of the game, though, was Bobby Glacier being robbed of a home run by Steve Moore in right field. In the eighth inning, Moore leaped at the fence to make the catch, then tumbled over. Club Mexico argued that he was airborne, carried over the fence and the hit should have been a home run instead of an out. A fan outburst prompted commissioner Anthony Owens to take the microphone from announcer Jaime Segura and threaten to stop the game if fans insisted on swearing and arguing. \"That was probably one of the best catches I've ever seen,\" Ryan said of Moore's grab. Rawley impressively caught both games in 90-degree heat, as did his Club Mexico counterpart Elias. Though their intensity picked up in the afternoon, there was a lot of goodwill between the teams throughout the day. Tigres lead-off hitter Max Dodson gave Elias a quick hug before his first at-bat of the deciding game. When Elias was up to bat next, he tapped Rawley's left kneeguard with his bat. It was brotherly love that made Steve Glacier switch teams after last season. He played for the Stockton Tigres in 2014. Glacier moved to Club Mexico to play with his brother Bobby. At age 33, Steve Glacier said he only has so many chances left to play with his 35-year-old sibling. On Sunday, they were able to toast a title. \"It's one of those things that happens in baseball,\" Steve Glacier said. \"Anything and everything will happen in championship baseball.\" By Kelly Jones", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:00:17.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
