The hotel for many years was the Holiday Inn Southeast.\nThorntons now has two existing stores at the intersection: one on the northeast corner and a newly remodeled one on the southeast corner.\nThorntons spokeswoman Erin Jones said the store on the southeast corner will remain. A Rally's restaurant and a Steak & Shake are located at the fourth corner of the intersection.\nLouisville-based Thorntons has recently been in an expansive mode. In late summer, it announced that it is moving to a new headquarters in the city as part of an expansion that will add 110 jobs.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nThorntons plans $28M HQ expansion\nThe announcement was made after the company was approved by a state board for up to $2.6 million in incentives for the $27.78 million headquarters project.\nThe convenience chain retailer will be relocating the headquarters from its current 46,000-square-foot facility on Linn Station Road to a new 92,500-square-foot store support center on Old Henry Road with construction expected to begin later this year.\nThe company also has recently rebuilt several stores including one downtown on Broadway.\nFamily-owned Thorntons was established in 1971 and now owns more than 180 stores in six states.\nReporter Sheldon S.
