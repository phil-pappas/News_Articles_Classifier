I dare them to go for review and i’m sure we will win there as well.” \nKotoko will now move to 2nd with 48 points while Hearts drop to 13th with 40 points but avoids relegation though. \nStory by Ghana/Joy Sports/Benedict Owusu Sports News Follow Us I can see paradise in her eyes which brightens more than the moon and the sky.
