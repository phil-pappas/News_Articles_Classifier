Photograph by: Michael Bell , Regina Leader-Post \nREGINA — Some of the traits that make Colby Williams a successful hockey player also make him a lousy spectator. \nLike a racehorse confined to the barn, the captain of the Regina Pats is fighting to bridle his own competitive instincts while nature runs its course with an injured arm. \nIt’s a helpless feeling for Williams, who’s frustrated by the fact that he can’t expedite the process. \n“Patience is a gift,” Williams said with a laugh, trying to find some humour in his tedious recovery. “I feel like I can skate right now. I feel like I can do this and do that but I’m not a doctor. \n“They obviously know what they’re doing and you have to respect that but it’s definitely tough getting your reins pulled back all the time. I’m always a guy who tries to push my limits but with this particular injury you have let it heal and make sure it’s all good.” \nWilliams, 20, was hurt in an off-season mishap when he fell through a glass table, causing serious damage to the forearm. \nIt occurred shortly after he attended a summer development camp with the Washington Capitals, who selected him in the sixth round of the 2015 NHL draft. \nThe first consequence of the injury was that it limited him to spectator status for his first official NHL training camp in the fall. The next setback occurred last week when he missed the start of the WHL regular season. \n“Right when it happened I thought about everything,” he said. “I didn’t really know how to approach it. I’m just trying to stay positive and take it as things happen for a reason.” \nDespite initial fears of a season-ending injury, Williams shouldn’t have to wait much longer to get back on the ice — even if it’s not at full speed. \nThe Pats are prepared for their No. 1 defenceman to sit out the entire first half, but he’s optimistic it won’t be that long. \n“I’m hoping definitely before Christmas and hopefully around November,” said the Regina product. “You just never know with this type of injury. You can’t rush it. It’s not like you can rehab it or do things to strengthen it. You just kind of have to wait. My goal is November 1st or somewhere in there.” \nIf anyone can do it, perhaps he can. \nIn addition to being one of the Pats’ most natural athletes, Williams is also among their best-conditioned players. His commitment to fitness suggests that — once the arm is fully healed — it won’t take him long to rejoin the team. \n“I’m pretty good in the summer for working out and training and trying to get better like that,” he said. “I can use these extra couple months to get stronger and take what I learned from Washington and come back healthier than ever.” \nIn the meantime, patience will continue to be a virtue for Williams — and for the Pats. The team’s inexperienced lineup is likely to endure some growing pains this season, especially in the absence of its leader and reigning MVP. \n“It’s not easy watching your own team,” said Williams, a WHL all-star last season. “I think we have a really good squad but there are definitely going to be some ups and downs with a young team. \n“I’m just going to try to lead as much as I can and rely on the other captains and leaders in the room to take on the role when I’m not there. I think they’ll do just as good a job.” \nWilliams is the lone holdover from last season’s leadership group, which included three graduating players. \nAlthough it’ll be a while before Williams can physically wear the ‘C,’ Pats head coach/GM John Paddock has made it clear that he’s prepared to wait. \n“It just shows how much respect he has for the game and the players,” said Williams. “He doesn’t just treat you like a piece of meat. \n“We’ve built a really good relationship. I have the utmost respect for this organization and our coaching staff. It shows how they care about their players and believe in them. \ngharder@leaderpost.com © Copyright (c) The Regina Leader-Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:39:21.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
