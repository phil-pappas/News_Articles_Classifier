One is a requirement that airlines show ticket buyers the full cost of fares, including taxes and fees, in­stead of burying the infor­mation in fine print. \nThe lobbying already has been effective. \nAt the urging of the big three and the Air Line Pi­lots Association, 262 House members and 22 senators wrote the administration asking for a freeze in the number of flights to the U.S. now allowed for three Per­sian Gulf airlines - Emir­ates, Etihad and Qatar - and discussions with the United Arab Emirates and Qatar about whether those airlines are violating aviation trea­ties with the U.S. \nSuch \"open skies\" agree­ments, a hallmark of U.S. policy for two decades, per­mit U.S. airlines broad ac­cess to aviation markets in more than 100 countries in exchange for similar access to the U.S. for those coun­tries' airlines. \nThe U.S airlines and their unions say the Gulf carriers have received $40 billion in subsidies from their govern­ments since 2004, in viola­tion of the treaties, and those subsidies have allowed them to charge lower fares and gain market share. \nConsumer advocates say the U.S. carriers have carved up about 80 per­cent of the lucrative trans- Atlantic market through joint ventures and allianc­es with overseas airlines, and now are trying to ward off competitors offering a cheaper alternative.
