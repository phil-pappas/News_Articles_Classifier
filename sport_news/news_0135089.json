Wayne T. Saunders said Tong Wu, 26, and Haofan Gao, 25, climbed to the peak yesterday with the intent of riding the train back down. However, Saunders said, there were no seats available, so the friends set out on foot.\nAt 6:45 p.m., Saunders said the Appalachian Mountain Club received a call that the pair were on the Ammonoosuc Ravine Trail, but Wu had twisted his ankle and couldn't walk.\n\"Compounding the problem was that they were not prepared,\" Saunders said. \"They lacked food and water, proper clothing and lights.\"\nTwo conservation officers stationed at the top of Mount Washington reached Wu and Gao at midnight and helped them back up the mountain - a process that took until 3:30 a.m.\nWu and Gao were then taken by vehicle down the auto road to their vehicle.\n-laurel.sweet@bostonherald.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:35:34.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
