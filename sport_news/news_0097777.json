Not only Liverpool, we have received several offers.\" \nMarchisio, a Juve youth product, signed a five-year contract in July to remain with the Old Lady until June 2020. \nMarotta also spoke of turning down offers for coveted France international Paul Pogba. \n\"There were offers from other clubs formalised, but we have rejected them because Paul is the heritage of the club,\" Marotta said. \"Maybe we have loaded him with many responsibilities, but this will help him to become a leader.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:18:01.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
