Leg's feeling a lot better. We're in the strengthening phase now. The progression, I'm actually feeling a lot better than what the program is entailed right now. But we're still gonna take those precautionary limits.\"\nChicago trails New York 2-0 heading into Game 3 on Tuesday night at Wrigley Field.\n___\n7:37 p.m.\nRoyals pitcher Chris Young got some family history out of the way early Monday - at the Hockey Hall of Fame.\nYoung, who is expected to start Game 4 on Tuesday, went to the Hall with his youngest son and wife, Elizabeth Patrick. Yes, that Patrick.\nElizabeth's great-grandfather was Lester Patrick, who won six Stanley Cups as a player, coach and executive.

She stood corrected this morning.\"\n___\n7:00 p.m.\nBlue Jays center fielder Kevin Pillar was hit on the back by a batting practice flyball off the bat of teammate Dioner Navarro.

The team reserves the right to cut off beer sales after the fifth inning if there are any problems.\nCoutinho says the Blue Jays did an assessment of the situation with police and then talked it over with Major League Baseball. He wouldn't say how many Toronto police officers would be at Monday's game, but said the number was \"fairly high.\"\n\"We reviewed all our staffing levels and police deployment and we're confident that was adequate,\" Coutinho said.\nIn the seventh inning of Toronto's Game 5 win over Texas in the ALDS, a raucous crowd turned rowdy when Blue Jays catcher Russell Martin hit Texas batter Shin-Soo Choo with his seemingly routine return throw to the pitcher, resulting in a go-ahead run for the Rangers. During an 18-minute delay to sort out the ruling, fans tossed beer cans among other garbage. Many of the cans didn't reach the field, striking fans in the seats close to the field.\n___\n4:20 p.m.\nAbout an hour before batting practice starts ahead of Game 3 of the ALCS, Blue Jays relievers Roberto Osuna and Ryan Tepera were out on the field warming up - by playing soccer.
