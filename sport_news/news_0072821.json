Eight of those came in the loss to Notre Dame which means Texas' offense has had nine total in its last three games, one more three-and-out compared to that loss to the Fighting Irish.\n1). The time of possession gap\nWhen the season began, the Longhorns were looking to duplicate the up-tempo, no-huddle offenses that other Big 12 schools run (like Baylor or Texas Tech). They're hardly at fault for trying to do so since it has worked for so many schools, including ones outside of the Big 12. The results at the start of the season couldn't have been more disastrous for Charlie Strong and Co.\nIn the 38-3 loss to Notre Dame, Texas' offense (led by Tyrone Swoopes) mustered up a grand total of four first downs on its first six drives, five of which ended in a punt. The longest drive lasted two minutes and four seconds. The offense has improved with Jerrod Heard at the helm, but the Longhorns still have the lowest time of possession per game of any Big 12 team at 23 minutes a game. Inversely, TCU has the highest time of possession per game in the Big 12 at just over 32 minutes per game.\nThe Longhorns can't afford to have quick three and outs when facing Boykin.\n2. Johnathan Gray as a receiving threat\nRicky Williams and Charlie Strong have both said that Gray needs to touch the ball more for Texas to be competitive in games. Through four games, he's totaled eight, nine, 15 and 11 touches. Oddly enough, he's been more effective as a receiver than a runner.\nGray's touches have increased with Heard at quarterback. DeAndre Washington just torched the TCU defense for 188 yards and four touchdowns on 22 total carries. Heard will get his rushing yards. TCU will have to see if Heard gets enough touches to get his.\n3. Beware Malik Jefferson\nThe freshman is second on the team in total tackles and is among the top 15 in the entire Big 12 in that category. He can come up to stop the run (as seen in the video above), get in the backfield (he has 3.5 tackles for a loss so far) and he's one of the best defensive players for the Longhorns. Texas has some young cornerbacks, so they could use Jefferson to pressure the quarterback into making quick decisions rather than having Doctson wreak havoc in the secondary.\n4. Protection problems\nThe Texas quarterbacks, regardless of who is back there, have been under siege this season. The Longhorns have given up 14 sacks through four games for a total of 101 yards. TCU's defense is hobbled, but it's still a Gary Patterson defense. The Frogs may be able to take advantage of Heard's youth with different blitzing schemes and frustrate him early.\n5. Some stats\n-- Texas is a perfect 9-9 (seven touchdowns, two field goals) in the red zone this season, according to the official Big 12 statistics page . However, the nine trips to the red zone in five games is the lowest in the conference by four tries. That's also counteracted by Heard's big-play ability.\n-- The Longhorns also have the second best turnover margin in the conference at plus-six. They've forced five fumbles and have intercepted five passes.\nFollow Joshua Friemel on Twitter at @Josh_Friemel .\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "https://vine.co/v/eTVE7L9hZZa/embed/simple", "https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "http://www.big12sports.com/fls/10410/pdfs/football/2015OverallStats.pdf?&DB_OEM_ID=10410", "https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-01T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:41:20.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
