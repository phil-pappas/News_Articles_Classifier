So far this season, coach Jay Gruden's team has been outscored 46-3 in that period.\nIn five of their six games this season, the Redskins have been ahead at halftime, but they've lost three of those.\n\"Obviously, whatever we're doing,\" Gruden said, \"has not been good enough.\"\nObviously.\n\"The big thing is awareness. Letting them know that this is what the last six games have been like in the third quarter.... 'Here are the stats and we have to do something about it,' \" Gruden said. \"I don't think we stop practice in the middle of practice, go to the locker room and come back out and pretend it's halftime. But the issue's there.\"\nLast week, for example, Washington took a 13-10 lead over the New York Jets into halftime. One 17-0 quarter later, the Jets led 27-13 and were on their way to a 34-20 victory.\nThe next day, Gruden declared that he was going to hold a staff meeting to discuss various aspects of that very topic: What have the Redskins been doing wrong in third quarters? How can they prepare better? What can be changed?\n\"After the game, that's the first thing we said: 'We've got to find a way to start coming out in second halves and do the same things we were doing in the first half,' \" linebacker Perry Riley Jr. said. \"I think this second half, this week, you'll see a different team.\"\nGruden made the case that the most striking thing about it is that his players seem to lose their \"edge\" during the break after the second quarter. If the coaching staff can manage to rectify that, he insisted, results should change.\nWhat Gruden did not say is that he and his assistants need to do a better job of making game-plan adjustments.\n\"You can't say it's Xs and Os because we win the first half. It's definitely more mental,\" Riley said. \"Maybe we come out too relaxed because we have the lead.\n\"When we have teams down, we need to step on their throats,\" he added, stomping his left foot on the locker-room floor for emphasis, \"and not let them back in the game.\"\nNotes: Players who missed practice Thursday because of injuries included CBs Chris Culliver (knee) and DeAngelo Hall (toe), C Kory Lichtensteiger (thumb) and RB Chris Thompson (bruised back).... LT Trent Williams and TE Jordan Reed were limited in practice as they progress through the league's concussion protocol. Gruden said he was hoping they could be cleared Thursday night or this morning. \"Would be great for us to know,\" Gruden said.\nBlog: Eat Sleep Redskins Redskins news, analysis and opinion\nFollow @EatSleepRedskin \n<img style = \" position: relative; float:left; margin-right:25px;border:1px solid silver;\" src=\"http://hamptonroads.com/files/imagecache/story_photo_main/files/images/1169571.jpg\" width=\"100\" height=\"75\" border=0\"></a> <h4>More Redskins</h4> <ul class=\"disc\"> <li><a href=\"http://hamptonroads.com/category/pilotonline.com/sports/redskins\">Team news</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://hamptonroads.com/blogs/joe-kacik\">Fantasy sports blog</a></li> </ul> </div> </div></div> </div> <div id=\"omc-right\"> <div class=\"related\"> <div class=\"related_inner\"> <h4>Related</h4> <ul class=\"disc\"> <li><a href=\"/2015/10/redskins-williams-reed-see-limited-time-jackson-likely-out\">Redskins' Williams, Reed see limited time; Jackson is likely out</a> - Oct. 22, 2015</li> <li><a href=\"/2015/10/clinton-portis-gruden-has-redskins-locker-room-zorn-didnt\">Clinton Portis: Gruden has Redskins' locker room, Zorn didn't.</a> - Oct. 21, 2015</li> <li><a href=\"/2015/10/healthier-rested-jets-pose-big-problem-redskins\">Healthier, rested Jets pose big problem for Redskins</a> - Oct. 18, 2015</li> <li><a href=\"/2015/10/gruden-redskins-desean-jackson-could-play-sunday-vs-jets\">Gruden: Redskins' DeSean Jackson could play Sunday vs. Jets</a> - Oct. 15, 2015</li> <li><a href=\"/2015/10/exredskin-riggins-speak-chesapeake-jamboree\">Ex-Redskin Riggins to speak at Chesapeake Jamboree</a> - Oct. 15, 2015</li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> </aside> <div class=\"story-head story-foot\"> <h2><strong>Posted to</strong>: <span class=\"tag\"><a href=\"/category/pilotonline.com/sports/redskins\">Redskins</a> <a href=\"/tags/redskins\">Redskins</a> <a href=\"/category/pilotonline.com/sports\">Sports</a> <a href=\"/tags/washingtonredskins\">Washington Redskins</a></span></h2> <div id=\"socialButtons2\" class=\"gigya-sharebar\"></div> </div>", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:46:23.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
