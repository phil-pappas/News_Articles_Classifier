The season finale of the five-race 2015 SCORE World Desert Championship is expecting nearly 250 entries from 25 countries and 40 U.S. States to compete in this, the 48th annual Bud Light SCORE Baja 1000. \nStarting and finishing in the heart of Ensenada in front of the historic Riviera del Pacifico Cultural Center, the course travels in a counter-clockwise direction. It includes the approximate 35-mile stretch to Ojos Negros, which is used in both directions. Outgoing, the course heads south from Ojos through Santo Tomas and along the Pacific Ocean. \nFeaturing seven checkpoints, the approximately 840-mile course covers both sides of the peninsula and parallels Highway 1 for nearly half of the race, looping south back to the Pacific and then crossing over to the other side of the peninsula below Puertocitos. The course then heads back North along the Sea of Cortez, past San Felipe paralleling Highway 5 and up to the junction with Highway 3. The rugged course then parallels Highway 3 traveling west then northwest back into Ojos Negros and the finish line in Ensenada. \nPre-running is expected to open near the end of October, allowing competitors nearly three weeks of practice time on the course. \nThe drawing for starting positions for all classes, except the featured SCORE Trophy Truck and unlimited Class 1, will be held Wednesday, Oct. 28, 2015. SCORE Trophy Truck, the marquee SCORE racing division for high-tech, 850-horsepower, unlimited production trucks and Class 1 open-wheelers will once again have a special qualifying session for start positions on Tuesday, Nov. 3 on a special 3.6-mile course on the off-road track at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T10:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:50:41.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
