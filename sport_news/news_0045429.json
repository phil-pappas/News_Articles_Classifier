(AP Photo/Jon Super) more > By - Associated Press   \nMANCHESTER, England (AP) - Juan Mata scored one goal and set up another as Manchester United came from behind to beat Wolfsburg 2-1 on Wednesday for its first win in Group B of the Champions League. \nDaniel Caligiuri took advantage of some slack defending from United to put Wolfsburg ahead after four minutes, but Mata won and converted a penalty to equalize before half time. \nThe Spanish midfielder then back-heeled a pass straight into the path of Chris Smalling, who slotted the ball past Diego Benaglio to seal the three points in the 53rd minute. \nUnited looked anything but potential Champions League winners, but manager Louis van Gaal should be satisfied his team secured the victory against a disciplined and threatening German opponent. \nThough United lost its opening match at PSV Eindhoven, all four teams in Group B are now on three points after the Dutch side’s 3-2 defeat to CSKA Moscow on Wednesday. \nUnited attacked with intent from the off, but the hosts were stunned in the fourth minute when Wolfsburg took the lead. \nSmalling, Morgan Schneiderlin and Daley Blind failed to dispossess Caligiuri in the right corner. He played the ball inside to Max Kruse, who returned the ball to the midfielder in the box and he stabbed the ball past David de Gea. \nUnited looked for an immediate reply, but struggled to find one. Dante flung himself into the path of Mata’s curling strike and diverted the goal-bound shot over the bar. \nAnthony Martial shrugged off his marker and negotiated his way past another before rifling a shot just wide. \nMatteo Darmian put in a crucial block deep inside the home penalty area and United immediately went on the counter. Martial turned his marker and squared to the unmarked Wayne Rooney but he planted the ball into the crowd. \nFinally the nerves eased inside Old Trafford when Mata cut in from the right and swung in a cross which was impeded by Caligiuri’s outstretched left arm. Referee Viktor Kassai pointed to the spot and Mata slotted the ball into the bottom left-hand corner. \nUnited had more composure about them in defense after Ashley Young came on for Valencia at half time. \nWolfsburg looked for another early goal, but luckily for United, Darmian was on hand to deny Bas Dost an easy tap in. \nUnited took control of the game eight minutes into the second half. Smalling rolled the ball past Wolfsburg goalkeeper Benaglio, but Mata’s contribution was decisive. \nThe Spaniard flicked a wayward pass over the Wolfsburg back four and into Smalling’s path. The defender slid in and guided the ball past Benaglio with his right foot.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T01:25:31.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
