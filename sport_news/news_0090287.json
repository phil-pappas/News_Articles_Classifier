Running back Devontae Booker and punter Tom Hackett earned offensive and special teams recognition, respectively, for their performances in the Utes ’ 30-24 victory over California.\nBooker rushed for a season-high 222 yards and two touchdowns, while Hackett averaged 50.8 yards on four punts.\nThe latest accolades up the team’s season total of Pac-12 weekly awards to seven.\n“That’s a great honor,” Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said. “When you’re playing well and you’re winning those things seem to happen.”\nWhittingham added that it’s great for both Booker and Hackett and that he’s proud of those guys.\nPrevious honorees this season include Justin Thomas (Michigan), Gionni Paul (Utah State), Cory Butler-Byrd (Fresno State), Travis Wilson (Oregon) and Hackett (Oregon).\nWISHING SARK WELL: Whittingham offered his best wishes to USC coach Steve Sarkisian , who was dismissed on Monday.\n“I know Steve well. I wish him the best,” Whittingham said. “I hope everything is able to work out for him. That’s really the biggest key right now, is for Steve as a person, to make sure he gets everything back in order and my guess is he will. He’s a tough guy and we’re pulling for him.”\nAs for rumors that USC may be interested in pursuing Whittingham, the coach maintained his usual stance on speculation about other jobs and declined to comment.\nCOACHING HONORS: Whittingham was named the Dodd Trophy Coach of the Week by the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Foundation and the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl. The weekly award honors coaches from programs that magnify integrity, leadership and scholarship — as well as success on the field.\n“It is great to see a head coach that has been so loyal to a university and program achieve success the way Coach Whittingham has at Utah,” Dodd Foundation chairman Jim Terry said in a released statement. “Utah student-athletes are being recognized with all-conference awards both on and off of the field and it is a direct result of his leadership of those young men.”\nNOT A FAN: Utah offensive lineman J.J. Dielman , who is from Ahwatukee, Arizona, noted that he doesn’t really have any ties to this week’s opponent — ASU.\n“I used to go watch Cardinals games when they played there (at Sun Devil Stadium),” Dielman said. “But I’ve never been a Sun Devil fan, never will be.”\nEXTRA POINTS: Utah’s game at USC on Oct. 24 will kick off at 5:30 p.m. (MT) and be broadcast nationally on FOX . . . The 16 first-place votes the Utes received in this week’s Associated Press Top 25 tied a school record — matching the 2008 team after the Sugar Bowl win over Alabama . . . Boobie Hobbs has replaced Jordan Fogal as the backup at nickel back on this week’s depth chart. Fogal will miss the rest of the season with an undisclosed injury . . . Raelon Singleton has moved into the two-deep list at receiver.\nEmail: dirk@desnews.com \nTwitter: @DirkFacer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:21:54.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
