Both teams have had one win and four losses this season.\nMeantime, retired 49ers legend Joe Montana said his former team had made a mistake in letting go of former head coach Jim Harbaugh at the start of the year.\nHarbaugh was replaced by Jim Tomsula, who was instrumental in bringing Hayne to the 49ers.\nMontana told Fox Sports Radio that the 49ers' had been struggling since Harbaugh's departure.\n\"Here's a guy who been very successful for you quickly,\" Montana said.\n\"He put a good team together. Now he's gone and they're struggling. Players are leaving. Players are leaving? Is that Harbaugh's fault? I don't think so.\"\nFairfax Media", "external_links": ["http://blogs.mercurynews.com/49ers/2015/10/14/practice-report-rbs-hyde-bush-not-participating-so-hayne-taking-first-team-snaps/", "http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/san-francisco-49ers-joe-montana-jim-harbaugh-colin-kaepernick-101515"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:58:25.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
