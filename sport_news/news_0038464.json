(Photo: USA TODAY Images) \nPHILADELPHIA The odds were stacked against Middletown's Trevor van Riemsdyk from the start. \nForget that he never was drafted by an NHL team, or even how he made the Chicago Blackhawks roster last year out of training camp, beating out Klas Dahlbeck, Adam Clendening, Stephen Johns and Kyle Cumiskey for the last roster spot last October. \nThere was almost a perfect storm keeping him from raising the Stanley Cup with the Blackhawks, champions two out of the last three years. \n\"It was a crazy year,\" van Riemsdyk said. \"I couldn’t have imagined it going that way from the start to the finish. It was filled with surprises, but it was a fun year. Obviously there were some peaks and valleys and ended on a pretty high note.\" \nOn November 19, 2014 van Riemsdyk broke his knee cap, an injury he thought would end his season only 18 games after it began. \n\"At first it kind of seemed that way, but you match up the timeline with where series may end and stuff like that,\" the defenseman said. \"And you don’t know, even if you do get healthy, if they’ll use you just because you haven’t played in so long. I wanted to get back as soon as I could.\" \nThrough his recovery, Trevor relied on his brother James, the former No. 2-overall pick by the Flyers in 2007. The ex-Flyer knew just when to call and when to give his younger brother space. \nThen came another setback when Trevor was playing for the Rockford Ice Hogs of the American Hockey League trying to get back into NHL shape and hurt his wrist in April. Another two months of recovery after surgery on his wrist and the 24 year old returned for the last four games of the Stanley Cup finals. \n\"He was great during the whole thing,\" Trevor said of James. \"He was really supportive of me. I definitely know I wouldn’t have been where I was without him. I was really thankful for everything he has done, everything he continues to do for me and I’m lucky to have him as a brother.\" \nThe support made it easier not to rub it in to his older brother, that he had already won a Stanley Cup even though James has him beat by nearly 400 games played. Trevor van Riemsdyk is the first New Jersey born player to win the Stanley Cup since Jim Dowd won with the New Jersey Devils in 1995 and has the least amount of games played by any New Jersey born NHLer with his 22nd contest coming against the Flyers Wednesday night. \nThe middle van Riemsdyk — Brendan is 19 and playing in the USPHL Premier League — actually took part in the Flyers' development camp in July 2012, but he wasn't looking for a contract at the time. \n\"It was kind of just of a measuring stick, kind of a showcase deal where you just want to go there, play well and see where you match against that one organization's prospects and what it may be,\" van Riemsdyk said. \"I wasn't really going in there hoping for a contract right out of development camp.\" \nIn July, van Riemsdyk did get a contract, a two-year, $1.65 extension with the Blackhawks. Not bad for New Jersey's least experienced NHL player. \nDave Isaac; (856) 486-2479; disaac@gannettnj.com Read or Share this story: http://on.cpsj.com/1Lu4FmC Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:53:58.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
