I think this is part of the game, this is football, when we play at home with the Chelsea supporters calling my name, this is something that always gives me a lift. \n\"Every player needs this support, when you have supporters that are cheering and pushing the team forward, you can feel the energy.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:26:55.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
