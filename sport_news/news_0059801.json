They recommended \"further youth participation.\"\nSawyer asserted that \"the legitimacy of the parliament is not affected at all by low turnout \".\nThe commission said in a statement that they \"cannot overemphasise the importance of youth in political participation as a politically disempowered or discouraged youth poses a threat to a country's democratic future\".\nThe new parliament\nThe mission noted that the independent and individual candidates are higher in numbers than the parties running for the election which could \"make the parliament less party-based and might give rise to a fragmented and weak parliament\".\nNevertheless Sawyer said that \"this is a good beginning\" for Egypt.\nEgypt's parliament ‎will be comprised of 596 members, 448 elected as independents ‎and 120 from party-based lists. The remaining 28 seats ‎will be filled by presidential appointees.\nThe country has been without a parliament since the previous house, elected in late 2011, was dissolved in June 2012 after a court ruled electoral laws unconstitutional.\nPresident Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi currently holds legislative powers.\nOnce a parliament is in place, its members will have to vote on the laws issued by El-Sisi and his predecessor, interim president Adly Mansour.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:30:59.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
