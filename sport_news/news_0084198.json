We are not just an area with cheap dirt.”\nLevine, one of the forecast’s lead authors, said the labor market has recovered, and the jobless rate – 6.4 percent – is chipping down at a faster clip than the rest of the state.\nTaxable sales growth – it climbed 5.7 percent to $16.5 billion in the first quarter of 2015 from the same period in 2014 – was higher in the Inland region than it Orange and Los Angeles counties. Hotel revenue is up 12 percent.\nTourism is on the rise.\nAnd the population has grown by 1.1 percent, faster than Los Angeles County – from January 2014 to January 2015.\nThe forecast said affordable residential and commercial real estate in the region will continue to attract more residents and contribute to the region’s success moving forward.\nMedian price on existing homes, though rising 6 percent to $282,652 in the second quarter in the Inland region, is still far lower than coastal counties like Los Angeles, where the median was $507,349, or the pricier Orange County, where the median hit $660,263.\nThornberg and Levine predict population in the Inland region will grow at a pace of 1.8 percent in 2016, and then at a rate of 2 percent.\nThrough 2020, the forecast says this will be the affordable housing destination for Southern California. It will be a new hub to multiple employment centers, the forecast says.\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvkfde-b88520216z.120151001164425000g7bcbe7j.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://files.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/multiplier/PE_R_UCR_FORECAST_1002/002ECONOMY_JOBS.JPG", "http://files.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/multiplier/PE_R_UCR_FORECAST_1002/004ECONOMY_HOUSING.JPG", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://files.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/multiplier/PE_R_UCR_FORECAST_1002/005ECONOMY_HOUSING2.JPG", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvkfde-b88520216z.120151001164425000g7bcbe7j.10.jpg", "http://files.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/multiplier/PE_R_UCR_FORECAST_1002/003ECONOMY_MANUFACTURING.JPG", "http://files.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/multiplier/PE_R_UCR_FORECAST_1002/001ECONOMY_STRENGTH.JPG", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:08:54.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
