The Blue Jays-Rangers game had an incredible finish, and Tony Romo said something privately to Tom Brady after last Sunday’s game.\nTony Romo to Tom Brady: ‘See you in February’: “On this week’s edition of Showtime’s ’Inside the NFL,’ the Dallas quarterback is seen connecting with New England quarterback Tom Brady following the Patriots 30-6 win over the Cowboys last Sunday at AT&T Stadium. Romo approaches to give Brady best wishes, and was caught offering an interesting farewell.” ( WEEI.com )\nChuck Pagano cites ‘amnesia,’ can’t remember working out Dion Lewis: “Who’s that?

They looked — albeit in a one-game sample against a defense as porous as theirs has been at times — like maybe even a team with something of a future.” ( The Boston Globe )\nCeltics rookie R.J. Hunter continues to have surprising success: “Boston Celtics guard R.J. Hunter was dribbling along the baseline, seemingly headed for the corner to do what he loves to do and that’s launch 3s. And then at the last minute while under the rim, he delivered a perfect, no-look bounce pass to Evan Turner for a lay-up. The Brooklyn Nets never saw it coming.” ( CSNNE.com )\nPhoto finish: Meet the 2015-16 Boston Celtics\nPrevious -- of -- Next Isaiah Thomas, guard, four-year veteran, second season with Celtics: In 21 games with the Celtics in the 2014-15 season, Thomas averaged 19.0 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 5.4 assists in 26.0 minutes.
