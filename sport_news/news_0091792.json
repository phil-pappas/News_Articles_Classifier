(AP Photo/Tony Avelar)\nNot too long ago, blowout losses still left Jim Mora publicly fuming.\nRemember Oct. 26, 2013? That was the night UCLA entered Autzen Stadium as a 24-point underdog. No one expected the Bruins to beat Oregon, but they kept it close. Heading into the fourth quarter, UCLA trailed by a single touchdown — an admirable effort despite the Ducks’ eventual run to a 42-14 decision .\nIt wasn’t enough, and Mora made sure everyone knew it.\n“We’re so close, but it doesn’t matter,” Mora said after the game , pounding the table in front of him. “We’re not after being close. Heck with being close. Losers can be close! We want to get it. We want to win those games.\n“The coulda, the woulda, the shoulda, all that crap, we don’t want that. I’m tired of that. It’s time for UCLA to turn the friggin’ page. And be something different. And win those games. That’s what it’s time to be.”\nPlenty of time has passed. In the last 720 days, the No. 18 Bruins have played 25 more games under Mora. Through that stretch, they have only beaten two teams ranked higher at kickoff time: a 17-7 win over Arizona last November, and a 40-35 victory over Kansas State in the Alamo Bowl on Jan. 2.\nTheir latest attempt at an upset resulted in a deflating 56-35 loss at No. 15 Stanford on Thursday night, their eighth straight to the Cardinal (5-1, 3-0) and fifth under Mora. And whereas there was no bottling up Mora’s passion two years ago, this loss brought out a much more subdued demeanor.\nThere was no table-thumping this time. Mora stayed calm, barely raising his voice through the next several minutes. He referred again and again to how hard his players have worked, and how hard they will continue to work. He suggested recruiting more and coaching them up.\nAnd, unlike at Oregon in 2013, he did not talk about UCLA’s past. Asked if losing five straight games to Stanford ever starts to become a “mental thing,” he acted as if he and his and his Bruins (4-2, 1-2) have memory wipes done after each game.\n“It does for you guys,” Mora said. “Every year, we’re a new team. … The only people that harp on the past are the fans and the media because it’s something to talk about. Because it’s there and you can’t deny it.”\nPreparation and self-evaluation, he added, does not change based on game results. This is a fair point: A team must believe in its core philosophies, establishing a foundation that keeps the team from veering too high or too low. Still, five straight losses to the same opponent by a combined 77 points suggests that the foundation itself might need fixing.\nAdvertisement\nDespite the lopsided final score against the Ducks two years ago, Mora’s fury was tinged with optimism.\n“We’re not good enough yet,” he said then. “I’m not good enough. The coaching staff’s not good enough. Our program’s not where it needs to be yet, but here’s the positives: We know what we can be. We have a vision of what we’re gonna be.”\nFast forward to Thursday night at Stanford Stadium, where a reporter asked: “What leads you to believe you’re closer to getting that done?”\n“I don’t know that we’re closer,” Mora said. “We weren’t closer tonight. I don’t remember saying that I was led to believe that we were closer.”\nMaybe he’s right.\nAbout the Author Reach the author at jack.wang@dailynews.com or follow Jack on Twitter: @thejackwang .\nFull bio and more articles by Jack Wang Back to top", "external_links": ["http://mn1-laedit.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20151016/SPORTS/151019527/AR/0/AR-151019527.jpg&maxh=400&maxw=667", "http://twitter.com/thejackwang", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cz9QiTPr6ug", "http://mn1-laedit.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/persbilde?Avis=LA&ID=37"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:41:55.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
