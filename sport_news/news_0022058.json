The Bobcats, who will host nationals this season, open their campaign tonight. (BRUCE BUMSTEAD/BRANDON SUN) \nThe Brandon University Bobcats women’s volleyball team is about to embark on a special season. \nFor the first time in BU history, the school will host a Canadian Interuniversity Sport championship tournament, which means the Bobcats have an automatic berth in the eight-team event regardless of how they do in conference play. \nHead coach Lee Carter doesn’t want to take anything for granted, but knows having a spot at the tournament in March allows him to take a few more risks this season. \n\"We can try to do some things that lend to our athleticism and know that it might take a little longer for them to settle in,\" he said. \"For the most part, the way the girls look at it is day-by-day and as coaches we look at it long term and say ‘What do we need to get there?’ and ‘When do we put it in?’ So we can take a little more risks.\" \nNo team in Canada West knows what to expect from the Bobcats this season, which could contribute to them being ranked seventh out of 13 teams in the conference’s coaches’ poll. The reason no one knows what to expect is they haven’t played a match with their full roster yet. \nFifth-year left side, and team captain, Shanlee McLennan has missed every pre-season contest with an ankle injury and is expected to see limited action when the Bobcats host the defending national champion Trinity Western Spartans tonight at 6 and Saturday (5 p.m.) at the Healthy Living Centre. \nMcLennan led the team with 2.67 kills per set last season, was second with 0.33 aces per set and third with 2.24 digs per set. She’s expected to play a big role again when she returns. \nMcLennan contributes \"everything: attack, block defence, but overall leadership,\" Carter said. \"She is a glue player and people love to play around her and her enthusiasm is contagious, and that’s why she’s our captain. You need your captain on the floor more often than not, so we’re hoping that she gets back sooner than later.\" \nThe Bobcats will be an experienced team this season with three-time CIS libero of the year Donata Huebert back for her fourth season and setter Mary Thomson back for her fourth campaign. Nikala Majewski, who made the conference’s all-rookie team last season, will be a full-time starter, although she may jump back and forth between right side — which is open after Victoria Dakin graduated —and the second left side spot. \nCarter has a lot of options for the other outside hitter position. With import Vaovai Aiono not returning, Carter is looking at fourth-year Gillian Leech, a Brandonite, or third-year Regan Dahl to fill the other spot. Both are good servers and who starts may depend on who the Bobcats play. Leech is a little stronger in the back row, while Dahl is a better blocker. College transfer Grier Moffet could also fill in on the outside, while any of BU’s middles could move over to right side. \nDespite losing Meaghan Robertson, Carter is very confident in his middles and hopes to have a strong block defence game. Baker, who had a .231 attack percentage as well as 1.90 kills and a team-high 1.23 blocks per set last season, is back along with Courtney Roberts, who had 1.06 kills and 0.82 blocks per set last season. Breanne Sytnyk also joins the team after playing two years at the University of Alaska Anchorage, while second-year Sara Barker and new recruit Jennifer McLean are pushing for court time as well. \n\"I think middle is going to be our strength,\" Carter said. \"Courtney Roberts has come back in phenomenal shape and she’s fast and getting to the ball. Both Jodie Baker and Breanne Sytnyk are doing a great job. Jodie’s coming back from an injury so we haven’t really seen her too much in that position yet. Sara and Jenny are young but they work hard. I believe that our overall depth at middle is one of the strongest in the league.\" \nThe Bobcats have an extremely difficult first half of the season with home matches against Trinity Western (third in CWUAA coaches’ poll) this weekend, home matches against UBC Okanagan (first) in November and visiting Alberta (second) in December. Carter anticipates those three to top the league this season but a battle between a lot of other teams for the final four playoff spots. \nHe expects to make the post-season and doesn’t want his players to get too caught up in the hype surrounding the season and hosting nationals. \n\"It’s an exciting year, but our process is such an important thing,\" Carter said. \"We know that we have the carrot at the end of the season, but right now we need to take care of day by day and that will make us successful.\" \n<B>CAT SCRAPS: TWU’s roster includes middle <B>Alison Quiring of Brandon … The BU men’s volleyball team tied for 10th in the Canada West coaches poll with UBCO … Today is the last day to buy tickets for the Bobcats’ Wall of Fame induction ceremony, which will take place at the Victoria Inn on Saturday at \n10 a.m. Tickets are $40 each and may be purchased at the HLC …Saturday is busy for BU athletics. In addition to the Wall of Fame and volleyball matches, the women’s basketball team hosts Dakota College-Bottineau at 1 p.m. The soccer teams will also take on Assiniboine Community College in the Prowler Cup. The women’s game kicks off at 1 p.m., followed by the men at 3 p.m. The women’s game is a forfeited win for BU as ACC won’t have enough players. It will field a team with current players and alumni. \n» cjaster@brandonsun.com \nRoster for the 2015-16 Brandon University Bobcats women’s volleyball team: \nNo. Name Position Year Height Hometown \n1 Danielle Larocque LS 1 5-11 Brandon \n3 Donata Huebert Lib 4 5-9 Minden, Germany \n4 Regan Dahl LS 3 6-0 Grande Prairie, Alta. \n5 Shanlee McLennan LS 5 5-11 Winnipeg \n6 Gillian Leech LS/Lib 4 5-10 Brandon \n7 Hope Schneider S 4 5-7 Brandon \n8 Courtney Roberts M 3 6-2 Brandon \n9 Nikala Majewski LS 2 5-11 Winnipeg \n10 Mary Thomson S 4 5-10 Brandon \n11 Jennifer McLean M 1 6-3 Birch Hills, Sask. \n12 Jamie Campbell Lib 2 5-7 Brandon \n14 Sara Barker M 2 6-2 Winnipeg \n15 Jodie Baker M 4 6-1 Brandon \n16 Grier Moffet LS 5 5-11 Calgary \n17 Breanne Sytnyk M 3 6-0 Shoal Lake \nRS Tyneille Neufeld LS 2 5-9 Winnipeg \nRS Elly Prince S 2 5-9 Calgary \nHead coach: Lee Carter (11th season) \n<*t(18.5,0,\"1 \"103.5,2,\"1 \"127.5,2,\"1 \"159,2,\"1 \"177,0,\"1 \")><B>Assistant coaches: Loren Cory, Andrew Korol, Meaghan Robertson, Shane Smith,", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:04:38.794+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
