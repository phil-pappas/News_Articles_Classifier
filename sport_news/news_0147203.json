All aboard! \nIt is certainly no stunner that Randy Edsall is going to get fired, according to an InsideMDSports report , given that Maryland is a mess on the field this season. But it's a little surprising that the Terrapins may pull the trigger at midseason. Maryland is willing to eat $2.6 million to make the change for his salary next year and a $500,000 buyout, and apparently, is in a big hurry to do so. \nEdsall is 22-33 at Maryland, including an 0-11 mark against top-25 teams and an average losing margin of more than 23 points in those games. That tends to get a coach fired, especially with donor support lagging for a new $155 million training facility. \nIf/when it happens, the move impacts Rutgers in so many ways. The Terrapins are not only a yearly opponent but a rival in recruiting, so the longer that program is struggling to find an identity, the better it is for the Scarlet Knights. \nWhich is why this next sentence should scare the you-know-what out of folks in Piscataway: Greg Schiano is the perfect hire for that job, and maybe more importantly, it's a very good landing place for the former Rutgers head coach, too. \nRELATED: Leonte Carroo alone can't turn around Rutgers' season \nFor Maryland: He is a proven program builder who recruits well on the East Coast, and while his two years with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers were unsuccessful, he can point to several of his former Rutgers players on NFL rosters. Maryland also needs somebody who will not lose sight of the academic part of the job, and Schiano certainly has that on his resume. \nFor Schiano: Will there be a better opening? The Miami job might open, and while he has recruited well in South Florida but it's hard to think of a place with more out-of-whack expectations. Illinois? Virginia? Tennessee? Maybe, but I'd say Maryland is a better fit than all three. \nSchiano has been out of coaching for two full seasons now, and I'm not sure he can wait a third. He has a strong relationship with former Big East assistant commissioner Nick Carparelli, who is now senior director of college sports at Under Armour ... which, of course, was founded by Maryland mega-donor Kevin Plank. \nSo it makes sense on a lot of levels. Of course, I can think of another job that makes sense for Schiano, too. \nSteve Politi may be reached at spoliti@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @StevePoliti .
