They combined for ten points. Ten. \nSure, it was pre-season. And, yes, it was against the Oilers. But just imagine if they were able to do even half of that in a real game. \n“More please,” the city collectively sighed. \nIf you’re a Canucks fan and deprived for years of young, promising skilled players, the whole concept was like adult literature content. \nBut this so-called kid line was not for long, disbanded shortly after its shooting star pre-season performance in Edmonton. \nThe coach had other plans, and said maybe — maybe — he’d revisit this trio sometime later in the season. \nWell, that sometime appears to be now. \nIt’s always funny how one game in an NHL season can so dramatically sway the narrative. On Friday morning, the Canucks were a win away from a franchise-best start to the season, and one of the nicest surprises in the NHL. \nToday, the Sedins are off to a lethargic start, the power play is in shambles and Horvat hasn’t licked a drop at even strength in five games. \nThat’s just how the pendulum swings, and a 4-3 loss Friday to St. Louis was enough to precipitate change. \nJannik Hansen skated with the twins Saturday, Brandon Sutter was on a line with Radim Vrbata, and Horvat was dropped to the third line. \nBut what a line. At least, what a line it could be, with Horvat, Baertschi and Virtanen. It could also start slow, get scored on by Connor McDavid, lose the trust of the coach and be dissolved before the third period. \nThat’s how it goes with young players and most NHL coaches. \nInterestingly, Horvat needs Virtanen right now more than the other way around. The second-year centre had a painfully tough night against the St. Louis Blues Friday. He was on the ice for three even-strength goals against. \nHis line, which included Derek Dorsett and Radim Vrbata, played like a cat in a plastic bag. \nMeanwhile, Virtanen showed steady improvement in his second game. He had three shots on net, several nice hits and used his speed up and down the wing, creating space. \nHorvat needs that right now. He needs help on the forecheck and he needs someone on his line to provide some net presence as he searches to try and find that groove he was in during the pre-season. \nJoining them is Baertschi, who was scratched Friday as part of a loose rotation, not entirely because of disappointing play, Willie Desjardins revealed Saturday. \nDesjardins has three young players he lacks history with ­— Baertschi, Virtanen and Jared McCann — and is cycling them in and out of the lineup. \n“I think they all can play, so I want to get them all in, but there seems to be three spots for two guys,” the coach said. \n“I don’t think it’s bad for a guy to sit out after playing a couple of games. At the same time, if they’re playing well, I do want to keep them in.” \nKnowing all of this allowed Baertschi to deal with his one-game sabbatical fairly easily. \nOn his return, Baertschi vowed to be “gritty,” but it doesn’t mean what you think it means. \n“When I’m gritty, my stick is really heavy, it’s tough to lift my stick,” Baertschi said. “I’m possessed with the puck, pretty much. \n“It’s not going out there and hitting guys. It’s being involved in the game. \n“Forcing turnovers, not with big hits but with a smart stick. That’s when I’m at my best and that’s what I’ve been working on.” \nIf he plays as good as he talks, he’ll be working his way out of that rotation sooner than later. \njbotchford@theprovince.com \ntwitter.com/@botchford © Copyright (c) The Province", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:20:58.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
