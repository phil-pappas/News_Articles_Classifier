The following day, her Asbury exams completed, she was driving home to Crofton on the Bluegrass Parkway when she fell asleep at the wheel near Bardstown. In the ensuing wreck, Baker's 2006 light blue Ford Mustang went airborne and crashed into a guardrail. \nAmong other injuries that resulted, her lower left leg was badly mangled. Eventually, it had to be amputated just below the knee. \nAfter she began her unlikely volleyball comeback, several newspaper articles were written about Baker. \nIn Oklahoma, staff members with the women's U.S. sitting volleyball national team ran across those stories online. \n\"We read about Courtney and she sounded like someone that would be a good prospect for what we do,\" said Bill Hamiter, head coach of the U.S. women's sitting volleyball national team. \"We reached out to her to see if she was interested.\" \nBaker was leery at first, but warmed to the idea of another way to continue to play volleyball. \nIn standing women's volleyball, the dimensions of the court are 59 feet by 29'6 and the net is 7 feet, 4 inches high. Women's sitting volleyball features a playing area of 32 feet by 9'7 and a net that is 3 feet, 5.34 inches high. \nWhen she took up the new sport, \"I had to get used to the low net and playing on my butt,\" Baker said. \"I started improving, and I think (Team USA) saw potential in me.\" \nEnough so that Baker made the American roster for the Parapan AM Games (companion of the Pan Am Games) as a reserve. \n\"I did not start, but I did play in, I think, three (of five) games,\" Baker said. \"And we won the gold medal.\" \nBy virtue of claiming a silver medal in the 2014 World Championships, Team USA qualified in women's sitting volleyball for the 2016 Paralympics (Sept. 7-18) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Baker's new goal is to make that roster and go to Rio. \nHamiter says that team \"doesn't have to be selected until July 15 (2016). Most likely, we'll name the roster earlier than that. We have a big competition in Beijing (China) in March. That will go a long way, I would think, in helping us pick our team.\" \nBaker has transferred from Asbury to the University of Kentucky. \"It gives me more schedule flexibility so I can make trips to Oklahoma to train,\" she said. The women's sitting volleyball team trains at the University of Central Oklahoma in Edmond, Okla. \nJ.P. Rader, the Asbury volleyball coach, says, \"We were really thankful to have Courtney at Asbury. We're proud of her and think what she is doing is amazing. We're pulling for her to make it to Rio.\" \nIn switching from college volleyball to the sitting game, Baker does not feel like she compromised the goal she set for herself after her car accident. \n\"I don't feel like I gave up on my dream,\" she says. \"I just found another way to play the game I love.\" Mark Story: (859) 231-3230.Email: mstory@herald-leader.com.
