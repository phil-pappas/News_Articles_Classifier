Now, let's go to work.\"\nThe Seahawks rallied, then won 36-35 in overtime.\n\"There were times we could have just folded up the tent, but we stuck it out,\" Lance said.\"But we just kept playing, and this is how it turns out. Iron sharpens iron.\"\nThe Seahawks, who improved to 6-0, scored on a 1-yard run by quarterback Ryan Chamberlain late in the fourth quarter to pull within one point. The Seahwks went for two but didn't make it and trailed 21-20 with 4:10 left to play.\nNorfolk Academy bobbled the ensuing kickoff, and the Bulldogs, who fell to 4-2, were pinned at their 1-yard line. They couldn't move the ball and punted. Atlantic Shores' Jordan Cannady fielded the punt at the Bulldogs' 34-yard line and scampered down the right sideline for a touchdown. A two-point conversion to put Atlantic Shores ahead 28-21 with 2:04 left.\nThe Bulldogs took over at their 35-yard line and drove for the tying TD. Quarterback Christian Randolph connected with Luke Frazier on a 3-yard touchdown pass with 37 seconds left, and the Bulldogs kicked the extra point that knotted the score at 28.\nBeginning overtime at the 10-yard line, Norfolk Academy needed only two plays to score, capped by Randolph's 8-yard run, and the extra point put the Bulldogs ahead 35-28.\nThe Seahawks also only needed two plays to score, with Chamberlain providing the finishing touches with a 2-yard push up the middle. Atlantic Shores again opted to go for two, and Chamberlain's pass to Anthony Fries was on target.\nChamberlain rushed for 98 yards and scored three touchdowns on 30 carries. He also completed 9 of 16 passes for 79 yards.\nRobinson paved the way for Norfolk Academy with 109 yards rushing on just nine carries.\nKey stats : NA-Wentz 7-17 rushing, 3-25, TD receiving; Randolph 8-9 rushing; Tabor 5-14 rushing; Estep 2-54 receiving.\n High Schools Sports", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://hamptonroads.com/2014/04/rankings-top-10-boys-soccer", "http://hamptonroads.com/2014/04/rankings-top-10-girls-soccer", "http://hamptonroads.com/2015/03/rankings-top-10-high-school-baseball", "http://hamptonroads.com/blogs/jami-frankenberry", "http://media.hamptonroads.com/cache/files/images/775031000.jpg", "http://hamptonroads.com/2014/04/rankings-top-10-high-school-softball", "http://hamptonroads.com/blogs/larry-rubama", "https://twitter.com/757teamz", "http://hamptonroads.com/2015/10/atlantic-shore-wins-overtime-2point-conversion", "http://hamptonroads.com/pilot/sports/high-schools", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?app_id=191370510928567&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F757teamz&send=false&layout=button_count&width=120&show_faces=true&action=like&colorscheme=light&font&height=28", "http://hamptonroads.com/2015/07/2015-public-schools-football-schedules"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:08:38.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
