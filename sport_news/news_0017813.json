Utley, contending he was trying only to break up a double-play, went in with a late Game 2 slide that fractured Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada’s right leg.\nFor that action, Major League Baseball chief baseball officer Joe Torre slapped Utley with a two-game ban — for Games 3 and 4. Utley has said he will appeal and it may be heard on Monday. If there is no immediate ruling or it is overturned, Utley can play.\nSo welcome to Queens.\nUtley had been asked if he expected Mets’ payback.\n“I don’t know,” said Utley, who has a long history of questionable slides.\nIf the Mets play by L.A. reliever Kenley Jansen’s rules, the Dodgers should exit their dugout ducking in the first inning. Jansen seems to believe baseball is too soft and wants a return to the old days when fastballs to the chin or cleats to the ankles were acceptable. Jansen felt Utley utilized “hard baseball” in his Tejada takeout.\n“That’s hard baseball. It could go either way. If they did it too, it’s hard baseball,” said Jansen, who got the Game 2 save. “The game’s starting to become too sensitive now, trying to protect players. We should go back to the old days and keep playing the game hard like the game used to be. Right there in that situation, it’s win or go home.”\nUtley was awarded second base after originally being called out when the call was overturned upon review. Replays showed Tejada, whose back was turned to Utley, did not touch the bag.\nThe tying run scored and the Dodgers added three more runs after a subsequent out in their 5-2 win. The Mets would have kept the lead and the inning would have ended had Utley been ruled out for interference.\n“You’ve just got to play the game hard. And Chase, being the veteran, been there, done that,” Jansen said. “I think that was a pretty good play. He tried to break the double-play up and that’s what he did.”\nSo now the world expects the Mets to play hard, too — a belief strengthened by Mets Game 3 starter Matt Harvey intimating there could be some payback. But in light of Torre’s ruling, every move will be viewed under a microscope.\n“Nobody’s really talking about that. If it happens, so be it,” Howie Kendrick, who hit the ball on the seventh-inning play, said of payback. “Those guys are going to try to play good baseball and win.\n“Things like that happen. It’s unfortunate but I hope nobody gets into those types of things. We all just go out and play baseball and see who the better team is,” Kendrick said.\n“You don’t want to see anybody lose a player. You want those guys to be a hundred percent, you want our guys to be a hundred percent,” said Dodgers manager Don Mattingly when asked about retaliation. “So I don’t really. I just think we go play, be ready to play, and just deal with whatever.”\nThat “whatever” should emerge as fury from the Mets and their fans to make a scorned woman seem utterly docile.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under chase utley ,  kenley jansen ,  los angeles dodgers ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  ruben tejada", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:20:06.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
