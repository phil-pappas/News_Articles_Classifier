That doesn’t happen any more, because our kids are truly excited about practicing and they know, there is a chance that someone else might win their starting position that day.’’ \nThat change in attitude has seemingly coincided with six straight playoff appearances for Bismarck-Henning, who would clinch a seven straight playoff berth with a win on Friday night. \nIn order for the Blue Devils to get their sixth win of the season and a 5-0 record in the VVC, they will need to find a way to stop the Buffaloes offense, which is led by running back Skyler Reed who has just under 1,300 yards this season after just six weeks. Georgetown-Ridge Farm also has a very good passing combination in quarterback Ethan Sliva and wide receiver Chase Hughes. \n“Reed and Hughes are special athletes,’’ Dodd said. “They can score on any play. And when you include Sliva at the quarterback position, you get a very explosive offense.’’ \nDodd said that his team will have a pretty simple plan of attack. \n“We have got to get all 11 guys around the ball,’’ he said. “Special players are going to make special plays. We just need to make sure that we have everyone around the ball to make sure that we don’t give up any big plays.’’ \nLast week, it looked like the Buffaloes were going to have another explosive night on the offensive side, scoring 14 points in the first quarter against the Salt Fork Storm. \nBut Georgetown-Ridge Farm was held scoreless in the final three quarters as the Storm pulled out a 35-14 victory. \n“We came out well, but it just seemed like we got away from the things we’ve been doing so well this year in those final three quarters,’’ Georgetown-Ridge Farm coach Nathan West said. “Give Salt Fork credit. But when you start making the kind of mistakes that we made against a good team like Salt Fork, I guarantee that you are going to lose that game.’’ \nWest said that the Buffaloes have spent this week getting back to basics. \n“We’ve had to correct those mistakes,’’ he said. “I also think we were a little flat on Friday night, so we have been trying to pick up the enthusiasm this week.’’ \nAccording to West, this year’s Bismarck-Henning team is a little different then the last two years when the Blue Devils outscored the Buffaloes 90-25, including a 48-6 victory last year. \n“Well they don’t have a bunch of 280-pound guys lined up across the line,’’ said West, as the Bismarck-Henning offensive line averages only about 230 this season. “But they are still great blockers up there. You don’t see them missing very many blocks. \n“They don’t have the big names (Donnie Powell and Mo Abbed) in the backfield this year, but those guys still run the ball effectively. You know that Bismarck-Henning is going to line up and try to run the ball down your throats, and when they lull you to sleep with that, they will hit with a pass over the top to Dylan Dodd.’’ \nSo, how does his team stop the Bismarck-Henning ground-and-pound attack? \n“We’re going to need to be strong at the point of attack and make sure that we tackle,’’ he said. \nAnd who is going to win this game? \n“It’s going to be the team that blocks and tackles better,’’ Dodd said. \nTonight’s game is set for a 7 p.m. kickoff in Georgetown and it can be heard locally on WRHK-FM 94.9 \nWestville at Hoopeston Area/Schlarman Academy \nTime — 7 p.m. Friday \nRecords — Westville 4-2 overall, 2-1 in Vermilion Valley Conference; HASA 1-5, 0-3 \nStorylines — After four years, the Tigers are one win away for five wins for the season and all they have to do is defeat the Cornjerkers, who is coming off a 72-0 loss to Bismarck-Henning last week. Westville defeated Oakwood/Armstrong-Potomac last week with Cameron Nicholas scoring two touchdowns on the ground and a 65-yard punt return and LaDavion Severado rushing for 110 yards and a score. With a tough offensive line, Nicholas, Severado and Logan Noel have put together good rushing totals for the past few weeks. The Cornjerkers had scored at least 20 points in two games before dropping back last week. \nMilford/Cissna Park at Oakwood/Armstrong-Potomac \nTime — 7 p.m. Friday \nRecords — MCP 2-4 overall, 0-3 in Vermilion Valley Conference; OAP 1-5, 1-3 \nStorylines — The Comets have lost their last three games and are looking to snap that streak against the Bearcats. The Comets have scored 18 points in the last three games, including last week’s 46-6 loss to Westville. Chase Vinson has 433 yards passing for OAP, including a touchdown pass last week, while Skylar Bolton had 436 yards rushing and Hank Chestnut has 147 yards receiving and Lee Mascari has added 93 yards receiving. Vinson has 49 tackles to lead the team while Cody Ayers has 48 tackles. The Bearcats are coming off a 24-14 win over Heyworth with Jake Montgomery scoring on two touchdown runs. Montgomery had 349 yards rushing with three scored, while Drew Hartmann has 396 yards and four scored and Kyle McNally has 251 yards rushing an 379 yards passing. \nSalt Fork at Fisher \nTime — 7 p.m. Friday \nRecords — Salt Fork 4-2 overall, Fisher 3-3. \nStorylines — After picking up a big win against Georgetown-Ridge Farm, the Storm step away from VVC action to take on the Bunnies. With a win Friday, Salt Fork would return to playoff action after missing it last season. Once again, the running and passing games for Salt Fork came up big in the win as Greyson Hughes ran for 119 yards and a 34-yard touchdown run and Connor Taylor passing for 222 yards and two touchdown passes to Caleb Fauver. The Bunnies are coming off a 28-14 loss to Tremont last week, but had won two straight games previous to that.
