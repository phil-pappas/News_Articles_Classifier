Sanders’s rise in the polls against Hillary Clinton has gained him an energetic following. by Bristow Marchant bmarchant@heraldonline.com 1 of 3 Order Reprint of this Story ROCK HILL \nLocal Democrats split themselves in two over Tuesday night’s debate. Supporters of the two leading candidates for the Democratic nomination gathered in two locations to take in their preferred candidate’s performance. \nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., drew a diverse crowd to McHale’s Irish Pub on debate night for a party organized by the local Sanders campaign, while supporters of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton held a separate watch party at Luke’s Sports Bar and Grille. \nA mix of younger and older people of different races filled the upstairs lounge at McHale’s to watch Sanders take the stage in his first national debate. Michele Horne, a Rock Hill resident, has been active in the Sanders campaign since earlier this summer, and she helped organize the debate party, handing out information in her “Bernie” t-shirt. \n“The American people need to see Bernie has a plan. He has facts and figures, not just soundbites,” Horne said. \nCurtis LeMay thinks Sanders has already changed the dialogue in the race because his surge in the polls has led to economic inequality becoming a central issue in the Democratic presidential campaign. \n“All his positions are being taken by other people,” LeMay said. \nHorne agreed with Sanders’s defense of using the label “democratic socialist” to describe himself, when he compared it to the successful economic and social model seen in countries like Denmark. Horne hopes Sanders’s debate helped enlighten voters. \n“There’s a misperception of democratic socialism,” Horn said. “It’s the philosophy that a well-educated, healthy population makes us a stronger nation ... People think it’s about Communist Stalinist Russia, and people need to understand the difference.” \nLeMay noted he served in the military, saying “The last thing I would support is a Marxist philosophy.” \nA smaller crowd of Clinton supporters gathered at Luke’s in Rock Hill to watch the debate on a big screen. \nJosh Hollington, attendee at the Luke’s watch party, was attracted to Clinton because he feels she is the stronger candidate in the Democratic field. \n“Sanders has flashiness, but it’s something that can’t go across partisan lines,” Hollington said. \nHe worries about a Republican candidate standing on stage next year “when Bernie Sanders next to him says something really socialist.” \n“To most Americans, that’s not something that’s really well-liked,” Hollington said. \nClinton, on the other hand, Hollington believes, can reach more common ground. “She’s not as flashy, but she’s practical. That’s the main difference.” \nAmy Hayes, chair of the York County Democratic Party, visited both events. She said most of the people at the Sanders’s event were not regulars at Democratic Party functions, showing the senator is doing a good job drawing new faces to politics. \n“It’s good to see him bringing in new people,” Hayes said. \nThe number of viewers at Clinton’s party were fewer, around a dozen, but Hayes said it included “more experienced organizers and no less enthusiasm.” She also noted several other Democrats were watching at house parties around the area. \n“I’m looking forward to a spirited primary season,” Hayes said. \nThe debate format also gave some other candidates who haven’t gotten as much media attention a chance to make a splash. Lee Perryman, attendee at Luke’s, came to the debate watch party with a Hillary sticker on his chest, but he came away from the debate more impressed with a lesser known contender. \n“(Martin) O’Malley’s the one people are going to be talking about tomorrow,” Perryman said of the former Maryland governor who had some stand-out moments during the debate. Before the debate, Perryman said he didn’t know much about O’Malley. \nThat’s why candidates participate in these debates; you never know who might steal the show.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:59:06.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
