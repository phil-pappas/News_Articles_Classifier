Coalfield can probably say the same thing. It was kind of a weird start when you’re delayed like that.”\nGreenback’s first score came with 3:31 left in the first quarter. Taking over on their own 36-yard line, quarterback Hunter Willis hit Kayne Roberts for a 22-yard touchdown, finishing off an eight-play, 64-yard drive.\nThe PAT was botched, and the 6-0 score held up to intermission.\nThings in the first half might well have been much worse for Coalfield (6-2, 2-2).\nIn addition to a fourth down miss, the Yellow Jackets lost a fumble on a handoff exchange with 6:16 left in the second period.\nThen, with 1:38 left in the half, a Greenback punt grazed off the foot of Coalfield’s John Ervin and was recovered by the Cherokees’ Tylor Jones on Coalfield’s 39.\nNeither time, however, did the Cherokees capitalize.\nGreenback made it 14-0 on the opening drive of second half when Devin Divine went left for a 21-yard touchdown run.\nAnother turnover by Coalfield — a fumble on the first play of the ensuing drive — might have led to a knockout punch by Greenback. But Willis’ fourth-down pass on the ensuing drive was intercepted by Tyler Keathley.\nCoalfield scored early in the fourth when Roberts was tackled in the end zone for a safety. But yet another fumble foiled its next possession.\nThe Jackets lost four of their six fumbles.\n“We were happy to be as physical as we were,” Kilpatrick said. “We came out and played good defense and stayed focused. Greenback-Coalfield is a notoriously physical game and both came to play tonight.”\nBill Howard is a freelance contributor.\nGreenback 14, Coalfield 2\nGreenback 6 0 8 0 — 14\nCoalfield 0 0 0 2 — 2\nScoring: G — Kayne Roberts 22 pass from Hunter Willis (kick failed); Devin Devine 1 run (Roberts pass from Willis); C — Roberts tackled in the end zone\nRecords: Greenback 5-2, 3-0 Region 2-A, Coalfield 6-2, 2-2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:35:47.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
