The report is available to all, without charge, at State of the Treadmill Industry 2015 . “The 2014 holiday season was marked by customers waiting for holiday deals, then finding that what they wanted was out of stock,” says Robert Braun, VP of Sales at Treadmill World. “As shipping costs have risen and free shipping has become more common, the costs of shipping equipment has gone up relative to the value of the machines. Thus, fewer lower end machines are made or sold.”\nOther topics that the report explores are the labor slowdown’s effect on supply and changes at the lower end of the market.\nThe new report provides a current economic analysis of the treadmill industry, including sales and profit trends and news of manufacturers and retailers. Readers who will find this report useful include manufacturers, retailers, prospective buyers, and anyone else interested in exercise equipment. Since its inception, the annual State of the Treadmill Industry report has become a much relied upon resource among those seeking a condensation of the latest industry happenings.\nAbout Treadmill World\nSince 2005, Treadmill-World.com has become a leader in its industry by selling name brand treadmills, ellipticals, stationary bikes, and home gyms for delivery directly from the manufacturer to the customer.
