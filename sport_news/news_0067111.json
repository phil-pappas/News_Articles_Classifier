We’re all good at this point.” \nHammond said he was “surprised” when told he would miss the first two weeks of the season with the injury. \n“I think we’re coming in a little shy of that,” he said, “but I’ve always been someone who kind of heals quickly. So to have it drag on long than I thought … in my mind I thought I was going to be ready for the opener, and when it comes to be the day before and you’re really not close, you get a little discouraged. \n“But obviously the fact I’m back a little ahead of the timeline is good. The work I’ve done now has obviously helped a lot.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:02:18.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
