(Photo by Chung ... more Photo: Chung Sung-Jun Thompson takes title 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Incheon, South Korea\nLexi Thompson broke out of a crowded pack Sunday to win the LPGA KEB Hana Bank Championship for her second victory of the year and sixth overall.\nThe 20-year-old American closed with a 3-under 69 to beat Taiwan's Yani Tseng and South Korea's Sung Hyun Park by a stroke. Thompson finished at 15-under 273 on Sky 72's Ocean Course.\nPark shot a 71, and Tseng had a 68.\nLydia Ko missed a chance to take the top spot in the world from Inbee Park, finishing with a 72 that dropped her into a tie for fourth at 13 under with Amy Yang and Gerina Piller.\nYang birdied the final nine holes for a 10-under 62. She tied the LPGA Tour record for consecutive birdies set by Beth Daniel in the 1999 Philips Invitational, broke the nine-hole mark for relation to par at 9 under, and matched the record for the lowest nine-hole total at 27. Yang tied the course record set by Sung Hyun Park on Thursday.\nPGA Tour: Emiliano Grillo of Argentina won in his PGA Tour rookie debut at the Frys.com Open by holing a 25-foot birdie putt for a 3-under 69, and then making the most out of a second chance in a playoff to beat Kevin Na. Grillo had a 3-foot birdie putt on No. 18 on the first playoff hole when he pulled it to the left. The next mistake belonged to Na, who made a 6-foot birdie putt on the last hole in regulation for a 70 to force extra holes. From the 18th fairway on the second playoff hole, Na hooked his driver behind a tree and made bogey. Grillo played a bold shot to just inside 10 feet. Needing two putts for the win, he made birdie.\nChampions: Bernhard Langer rallied to win the San Antonio Championship for his second victory of the year and 25th overall on the Champions Tour. The 58-year-old German star birdied the final two holes — making an 18-footer on the par-4 18th — for a 7-under 65 and a three-stroke victory over Scott Dunlap .\nEuropean PGA: Andy Sullivan of England easily won the Portugal Masters after extending his lead to finish nine strokes ahead. Sullivan had a five-stroke lead as he entered the final round at the Oceanico Victoria course, which started late due to heavy overnight rain. He increased that margin by hitting five birdies for a flawless 5-under 66 to finish with a total of 23-under 261.\nAustralasian PGA: American Matt Kuchar shot a second-straight three-under 69 to ease to a four-stroke victory over Australia's Aron Price at the Fiji International . World No. 16 Kuchar had a total of 4-under 284.", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/55/8813388/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/55/8813388/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T06:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:46:44.797+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
