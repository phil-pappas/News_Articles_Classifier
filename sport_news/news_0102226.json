In Game 2 of the NLDS between the Mets and Dodgers , L.A. infielder Chase Utley keyed a seventh-inning rally by executing a hard takeout slide on Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada -- a slide that broke Tejada's league and ended his postseason . (Utley was suspended for Games 3 and 4 by MLB , but because Utley's appeal of the suspension is pending he's still eligible to play.)\nAs for Game 3 of this particular NLDS, it will take place at Citi Field on Monday, with first pitch scheduled for 8:37 pm ET ( LAD-NYM preview/GameTracker ).

That means Harvey and the Mets may not get a shot at the main offender. Even so, Collins surely knows that in a postseason series such as this, you'd best not willingly put a runner on the bases. \nIt is a fact of true lore than every baseball team keeps in the manager's office a tattered manila folder that reads on the tab, \"Revenge List.\" All of this, possibly, will go in there. \nDeveloping.\nTopics: Brett Anderson , Chase Utley , Matt Harvey , Ruben Tejada , Los Angeles Dodgers , New York Mets , MLB", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:39:08.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
