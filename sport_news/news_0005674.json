Other teams will be fighting to keep their perfect win records, which should be easily accomplished by a few particular teams.\nAdChoices However, due to daunting matchups and terrible performances thus far, four teams appear to be already doomed in Week 4.\nKansas City Chiefs\n© Benny Sieu-USA TODAY Sports Kansas City head coach Andy Reid has a tough game ahead of him as the Chiefs face the red-hot Bengals this weekend.\nThe Kansas City Chiefs defense is simply giving up too many points and yards to opposing offenses, which negates nearly everything that Jamaal Charles and Co. is accomplishing. This is why they are going to lose once again, this time on the road to the Cincinnati Bengals.\nOver the first three weeks of the season, the Chiefs have allowed 89 total points—the fourth-most of all NFL teams. They have also surrendered an average of 307 passing yards per game and 10 total touchdowns through the air.\nAnyone who witnessed what Andy Dalton and A.J. Green accomplished last week against the Baltimore Ravens should be worried for the Chiefs defense. Green racked up 227 yards and two touchdowns, and the duo will be no match for the Chiefs secondary that just gave up five scores to Aaron Rodgers, three of which went to Randall Cobb.\nThe Chiefs should find their ways to score. However, the Bengals defense that has only allowed 200 rushing yards and zero touchdowns to opposing running backs this season.\nCincinnati will be looking at a perfect 4-0 record, while the Chiefs drop to 1-3.\nDetroit Lions\n© Jim Rogash/Getty Images Matthew Stafford #9 of the Detroit Lions reacts during the fourth quarter against the New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium on November 23, 2014 in Foxboro, Massachusetts. The Lions are looking to find their first win for the season, but it won’t come in a road game against the Seattle Seahawks. Last week, the Seahawks shut out the Chicago Bears, and Seattle will make it difficult for a struggling Lions offense that has only scored 56 total season points.\nSo far in 2015, the Lions haven’t been able to sustain drives, only tallying 4.9 yards per attempt on offensive plays. Matthew Stafford has completed 64.1 percent of his passes and thrown five touchdowns but has five interceptions.\nWhile Detroit’s ground game has managed only 135 rushing yards at a miserable 2.6-yard average, the Seahawks defense only allowing an average of just 203 passing yards per game and zero rushing scores to running backs all season, it will create challenges for the Lions to attempt to score.\nAs for the Seattle offense, Russell Wilson and tight end Jimmy Graham are on the same page after connecting eight times. They face a Lions secondary that has allowed 881 passing yards and five touchdowns the past three weeks.\nWith so many variables stacked against the Lions, they’ll walk away from Sunday 0-4.\nChicago Bears\n© Steve Dykes/Getty Images Quarterback Jimmy Clausen of the Chicago Bears passes the ball as outside linebacker Bruce Irvin of the Seattle Seahawks applies pressure on Sunday in Seattle. The Seahawks shut out the Bears 26-0.\nThe Bears were dealt the franchise’s shutout since 2002 when they lost 26-0 in Week 3 to Seattle. Now, they’ll post loss No. 4 against a suddenly hot Oakland Raiders offense that is churning like a well-oiled machine.\nChicago will likely again be playing with backup quarterback Jimmy Clausen, who recorded a putrid 63 total yards on nine completed passes. The team simply cannot rely on Matt Forte to score all the points. Granted, Chicago’s workhorse could manage a touchdown or two against a defense that has allowed three touchdowns to running backs this season.\nUnfortunately, that won’t be enough to put up a fight against Oakland’s explosive offense that’s racked up 848 passing yards, 315 rushing yards and nine touchdowns in three weeks. The Bears defense has allowed 10 touchdowns and 105 points—the most in the NFL this season.\nThe Raiders will depart Chicago with their third win of the season, forcing the Bears to 0-4.\nSan Francisco 49ers\n© Lance Iversen/USA TODAY Sports San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick gets ready to play the Chicago Bears at Levis Stadium. The San Francisco 49ers are off to a horrendous 1-2 start this season, and the latest headline is quarterback Colin Kaepernick is struggling with the team’s already simplified offense .\nKap and the 49ers offense are being picked apart because opposing defenses have claimed the embattled quarterback is predictable, as evidenced by his five turnovers to the Arizona Cardinals last Sunday.\nIn Week 4, San Francisco will host Green Bay Packers, who are guaranteed to dispatch the Niners. Jim Tomsula’s team has allowed a total of 93 points over the course of three weeks, which is the second-highest of all NFL teams. Now the 49ers team will face the NFL’s fourth-highest scoring team.\nThis game will easily turn into a blowout, and Aaron Rodgers could certainly churn out another five passing touchdowns just as he did Monday night. Look for the Packers to gain a massive lead and burn the clock while Kaepernick makes reckless decisions in attempt to save the game.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://sportsnaut.com/2015/09/report-colin-kaepernick-still-struggling-with-reads-despite-simplified-offense/"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:52:50.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
