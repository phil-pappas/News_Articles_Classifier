That connection was key for the Fliers on Friday. \nRieman hauled in six catches for 196 yards and two touchdowns as Clyde trounced Oak Harbor, 54-20, in Sandusky Bay Conference action. \n“Oak Harbor gave us a completely different look than we expected,” Clyde coach Ryan Carter said. “We adjusted and made some plays.” \nRieman caught a 59-yard touchdown pass for Clyde (5-1 overall, 1-1 SBC) in the first quarter for a 6-0 lead and a 61-yarder in the third quarter to extend the Clyde lead at the time to 40-20. \n“They’ve been pretty good all year,” said Carter of Nicely and Rieman. “They were giving us 1-on-1 coverage and we took advantage.” \nThe catch in the first quarter was the only score in the quarter but Jeff Winterfield found Garrett Duty for a 2-yard touchdown on the first play of the second quarter. The extra point gave the Rockets (3-3, 1-2) their only lead of the night. Clyde responded quickly, driving 65 yards in seven plays, capped by a rumbling 1-yard score from Josh Jenne. \n“I thought we gave up too many big plays on defense,” Oak Harbor coach Mike May said. “We changed up our defense a little bit but they made the big plays.” \nOak Harbor was forced to punt on the ensuing possession but the drop back was fumbled, allowing Dawson Montgomery to scoop it and scamper 25 yards for the touchdown. Clyde led 18-7 after a failed 2-point conversion run, but its second touchdown in 54 seconds was deflating to the home crowd celebrating Homecoming. \n“They’ve got a lot of good athletes,” May said. “They’re huge up front and they were aggressive. Their defense made plays and we had problems protecting Jeff at times.” \nNicely hooked up with Tanner Davenport on a 68-yard catch and run touchdown for a 26-7 lead. Oak Harbor got a score back when Winterfield kept it for a 3-yard touchdown. Clyde’s lead was 26-14 at halftime. \nMay thought the key to the game was the opening possession of the second half for Clyde. The Fliers shrugged off a holding penalty that negated a Frank Sewell 52-yard touchdown run to methodically work themselves down the field. In the end, Sewell got the touchdown - for 19 yards and a 33-14 lead. \n“We thought we were doing well at halftime and then we come out and give up a score right off the bat,” May said. “That didn’t help... We’re just trying to get better each day. Every week we have to come ready to play.” \nThe Rockets challenged again when Kalob Vargas scored from a yard out to cut the lead to 33-20 but it took Clyde just three plays to respond when Nicely hooked up with Rieman. \nNicely completed 10-of-18 passes for 324 yards and all three of his second half completions were to Rieman. \nClyde’s schedule doesn’t get any easier with a trip to (6-0) Edison next week. \n“We have a tough schedule,” Carter said. “Anything can happen and we have an undefeated Edison club next week. They’re a good football team but we’ll be ready.” \nWinterfield completed just 7-of-24 passes for 67 yards. 2 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1RlJzr9 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:41:32.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
