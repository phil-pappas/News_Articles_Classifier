Comment Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 3:18 PM Updated at 3:31 PM Posted Oct. 14, 2015 at 3:18 PM Updated at 3:31 PM • Browns out to prove OT win isn't just smoke Peyton Manning, at 39, is likely making his last trip to Cleveland. The first trip was in 1999, when he faced a quarterback, Ty Detmer, who will turn 48 this month. His last trip was in 2012, the year he jumped to the Broncos. Manning has not been great against Cleveland, posting an 80.9 passer rating that is well below his career mark of 97.1. He has benefitted from good defenses and bad Cleveland quarterback play, a trend the Browns hope to reverse Sunday. Here is a look at each Manning-vs.-Cleveland game. • DEC. 26, 1999 Colts 29, Browns 28, at Cleveland The Browns’ bye week strangely fell in Week 17, making this Week 16 game the finale of the team’s comeback year. The Colts, who still had a regular-season game left, brought a 12-2 record to Browns Stadium against the 2-13 Browns. Ty Detmer played quarterback in place of injured Tim Couch and got the Browns to an early 14-7 lead with a TD pass to Darren Chiaverini. With 11 seconds left in the third quarter, Terry Kirby’s second TD run gave the Browns a 23-14 lead. Manning had the ball last, steering the Colts to a 21-yard field goal by Mike Vanderjagt with four seconds left. • DEC. 15, 2002 Colts 28, Browns 23, at Cleveland Tim Couch went toe to toe with Manning (287-277 lead in passing yards, 105.3-92.4 lead in passer rating). The Browns led 23-18 on a William Green TD run in the fourth quarter, but Manning responded with two long TD drives for a 28-23 lead. Couch took over near midfield with 2:52 left. He passed the Browns to a first-and-goal with 1:23 left, but the advance died on the 5. • SEPT. 7, 2003 Colts 9, Browns 6, at Cleveland Manning struggled in a season opener against his former Indianapolis understudy, Kelly Holcomb. One of the worst statistical games of his career (55.5 passer rating) included interceptions by linebackers Ben Taylor and Kevin Bentley. Holcomb got to the 2 midway through the fourth quarter but settled for a field goal and a 6-all tie. With 2:51 left, Chris Gardocki’s punt pinned Manning at his own 8. He spread the ball around, reached the 27, and got a 45-yard field goal from Vanderjagt with six seconds left. • SEPT. 25, 2005 Colts 13, Browns 6, at Indianapolis Manning completed 19-of-23 passes and outplayed Trent Dilfer but couldn’t solve Romeo Crennel’s red-zone defense. Dilfer missed an opportunity when he got to first-and-goal from the 5 in the fourth quarter but settled for a field goal that shrank a deficit to 13-6. Dilfer’s last chance was a third-down pass that missed Frisman Jackson with eight minutes left. The Browns punted from their own 33. Manning then operated 14 plays, running out the clock. Page 2 of 2 - • NOV. 30, 2008 Colts 10, Browns 6, at Cleveland Manning threw interceptions to Brandon McDonald and Sean Jones and led Cleveland’s Derek Anderson 125-110 in passing yards. The Browns led 6-3 and had the ball near midfield with 10 minutes left when, on second-and-8, Dwight Freeney jarred the ball loose from Anderson. Robert Mathis recovered and ran for a touchdown. Anderson got the ball back twice more but didn’t come close to scoring. • DEC. 23, 2012 Broncos 34, Browns 12, at Denver Manning schooled rookie Brandon Weeden, throwing for 339 yards and hitting Eric Decker twice for touchdowns. A Von Miller sack late in the third quarter knocked Weeden out of the game. Colt McCoy was sacked on the next play and didn’t seem all there in what proved to be his last game as a Brown.
