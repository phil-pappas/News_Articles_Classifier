They went into the weekend trying to earn home-field advantage throughout the postseason, and are currently tied with Toronto for the top record in the league. \nIt certainly hasn't been drama-free for Young, who last pitched in the playoffs nine years ago with San Diego. \n\"I haven't thought about it that much really,\" Young said about ending his personal postseason drought. \"Just trying to get through the last week, and it's been an emotional rollercoaster for me.\" \nIn three starts against the Twins this season, Young allowed just two runs and 11 hits in 18 innings. In the sixth, he walked to the mound preparing to face sluggers Miguel Sano, Trevor Plouffe and Eddie Rosario. Young struck out all three swinging. \n\"Obviously, it was big for us to get another inning under his belt, save the bullpen a little bit,\" catcher Drew Butera said. \"He just had good deception today.\" \nLouis Coleman (1-0), Ryan Madson and Wade Davis wrapped up the win, with Davis notching his 16th save in 17 attempts. \nThe Twins began the day trailing Houston by one game and tied with Los Angeles in the AL wild-card race, and with only two days left to make up ground this was as devastating a defeat as they've had in 2015. The Angels beat Texas, pulling ahead of the Twins, and the Astros played later at Arizona. \nPerkins, hampered by neck and back trouble that led to his removal from the closer role, spoiled a stellar start by Ervin Santana (7-5) with a first-pitch fastball that Zobrist drove off the wall in right-center field. Zobrist then scored when right fielder Torii Hunter fumbled a single by Mike Moustakas, another blemish on an awful second half for Perkins. \nFOURTH STARTER? \nShould the Royals make it past the Division Series, Yost will likely need to decide between Young and lefty Kris Medlen to round out his rotation. The manager wasn't about to show his hand on Friday, though. \n\"I've already got it figured out,\" he said with a grin. \nSWEET RELIEF \nMadson induced All-Star Brian Dozier into a key double play in the eighth when he relieved Coleman. Eduardo Escobar led off the inning with a single before Dozier came to the plate. After a single by Joe Mauer, Madson struck out Sano swinging. \n\"Especially with that tight of a ballgame with the hitters that are coming up, those guys kind of smell blood once something gets going, so it's nice to just nip it right away,\" Madson said. \nTRAINER'S ROOM \nThree banged-up regulars were held out of the Royals' lineup, with CF Lorenzo Cain (knee), DH Kendrys Morales (quadriceps) and C Salvador Perez (thumb) on the bench, but Yost said he wasn't worried. Cain should be ready to play Saturday, Morales was available to pinch hit and Perez was rested with the afternoon game next. \nUP NEXT \nRoyals: RHP Yordano Ventura (12-8, 4.20 ERA) will start on Saturday. He's 8-1 with a 3.26 ERA and 81 strikeouts in 80 innings over his last 13 turns, and the only loss in that stretch was to the Twins at home on Sept. 7. \nTwins: LHP Tommy Milone (9-5, 4.04) will take the mound in the middle game of the series, coming off a critical win at Cleveland on Monday following an 11-day break due to weakness around his shoulder. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:20:27.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
