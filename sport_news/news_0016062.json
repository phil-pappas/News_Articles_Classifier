Oakland is allowing a franchise-worst 299.2 yards passing per game and has been picked apart so far by Andy Dalton, Joe Flacco, Josh McCown and Jay Cutler. \nThe Raiders’ best performance came in their last game when they kept Peyton Manning and Denver’s offense out of the end zone all day and intercepted two passes in a 16-10 loss. \nBut stopping Rivers won’t be as easy. Rivers has won six of his past seven meetings against Oakland and his 14 overall wins are the most any starting quarterback has ever had against the Raiders. \nRivers threw for 313 yards and led a late game-winning drive in Oakland last year and has thrown for more yards against the Raiders than any other quarterback since the team moved back to Oakland in 1995. \n“He’s a great quarterback,” cornerback DJ Hayden said. “He’s been in the league a long time. He’s a good veteran. He’s not scared to throw it and sneak it into windows and give his receivers the opportunity to make plays on the ball.” \nRivers’ supreme confidence in his arm and his receivers does give defensive backs the opportunities to make plays on the ball. \nThat has allowed him to throw for a league-high 2,116 yards on 177 completions and has him on pace to set NFL records in both categories. \n“You want to be in positon to make plays,” Amerson said. “He throws the ball so much that it will give more opportunities to us. We just have to take advantage of it.” \nMaking Rivers more dangerous is the talent he has around him. Receiver Keenan Allen leads the NFL with 53 catches, Danny Woodhead is a big threat out of the backfield with 26 catches and San Diego has two talented tight ends in Ladarius Green and Antonio Gates. \nGreen has 22 catches for 259 yards and three scores and was a big threat in the middle of the field during Gates’ season-opening four-game suspension. \nGates has 18 catches for 187 yards and two scores in his two games back. \nThe Raiders have struggled against tight ends, allowing 32 catches and six TDs in four games before shutting out Owen Daniels and the Broncos two weeks ago. \nDoing the same to Gates will be more difficult. \n“We have to monitor him,” safety TJ Carrie said. “Whatever package we put in will be to discourage throws to him because he’s a very excellent tight end and he can do a lot on the edges as well.” \nNOTES: S Charles Woodson took his usual Wednesday off as he nurses an injured shoulder. ...

RB Latavius Murray (shoulder), RB Taiwan Jones (foot) and defensive lineman Denico Autry (concussion) were full participants in practice.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:17:34.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
