Elmira is home against Nottingham at Ernie Davis Academy's Marty Harrigan Field, Horseheads welcomes Ithaca and Thomas A. Edison hosts Watkins Glen/O-M in a later 2:30 p.m. start. \nVestal (3-1) at Corning (3-1), 7 p.m. Friday : Both have done something this season a lot of teams have done in recent years: lose to Maine-Endwell. The four-time defending state champion Spartans started the season with a 54-7 win over Corning, then extended their state-record winning streak to 55 with last week's 28-0 victory over Vestal. Otherwise, Corning and Vestal have been stellar. \nVestal is ranked 21st in Class A by the New York State Sportswriters Association, with a 28-15 win over Ithaca, a 33-21 win over Fayetteville-Manlius and a 21-6 victory against Windsor. \nAfter being held to one touchdown by M-E, Corning has scored 141 points in the last three weeks in lopsided victories over Henninger (42-21), Ithaca (42-12) and Horseheads (57-26). Senior running back Devon Sullivan has put up a season's worth of stats in the last two games, rushing for 271 yards and four touchdowns on 18 carries against Horseheads after running for 218 yards and scoring five touchdowns against Ithaca. \nNottingham (3-1) at Elmira (4-0), 1:30 p.m. Saturday : These two have a common opponent in Central Square, which lost 80-8 to Elmira a week after a 45-41 setback against fellow Section 3 team Nottingham. \nLast week Nottingham suffered its first loss, 57-6, to Syracuse CBA. Elmira is ranked 24th in the state in Class AA and has allowed only one touchdown in the last two weeks after escaping with a 44-43 victory against Binghamton. Ithaca mustered only 73 yards of offense against the Express in last week's 53-0 loss. \nNot surprisingly, Elmira has done much of its offensive damage through the running game. Elmira's double-wing attack has produced more than 300 rushing yards each week and averages 8.6 yards per attempt. Dashaun Sutton leads the team with 593 yards on 68 rushes, and Allaah Sessions has contributed 421 yards on 44 attempts. \nIthaca (0-4, 0-2 Division 1) at Horseheads (2-2, 0-2), 1:30 p.m. Saturday : After two consecutive losses, Horseheads will try to return to the win column against an Ithaca program that has a 28-game losing streak that is the longest in Section 4. \nThe Blue Raiders have yielded 110 points in losses to Binghamton and Corning over the last two weeks, with turnovers and sloppy tackling a difficult combination to overcome last week in the 57-26 loss to Corning. \nFour of the five Division 1 teams in the Section 4 Football Conference qualify for the sectional Class AA semifinals, so a victory in this game will likely be enough to put the Blue Raiders in the postseason. \nWatkins Glen/O-M (3-1, 1-0 Division V) at Thomas A. Edison (1-3, 0-1), 2:30 p.m. Saturday : The Seneca Indians have won three straight and can put themselves in prime position to earn a berth in the Section 4 Class C semifinals with a win over Edison. Watkins Glen/O-M is coming off a 22-19 victory over Dryden after scoring a combined 110 points in victories over Elmira Notre Dame and Whitney Point. \nEdison will try to continue the momentum gained last week after earning its first win, 16-12, over Spencer-Van Etten after falling into a 12-point hole in the first half. \nWaverly (4-0, 3-0) at Chenango Valley (3-1, 3-0), 2:30 p.m. Saturday : The winner claims first place in Division III all to itself and pretty much secures one of the four spots into the Section 4 Class B semifinals. \nWaverly has moved up to the No. 8 Class B state ranking thanks to its an offense led by versatile senior quarterback Peyton Miller and a defense that has allowed 37 points all season, second best in the section behind Maine-Endwell's 34. \nChenango Valley bounced back from a 35-0 loss to Newark Valley with a 27-19 win last week over Owego Free Academy. \nOn Twitter: @SGAndrewLegare", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:34:05.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
