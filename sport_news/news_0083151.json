It’s officially fall and I find myself at a crossroad of seasons, still shaking my head over an endless summer where the Pacific Northwest experienced nearly 50 days of 80-degree temperatures or more. I can’t help but look back at the last three months and remember a summer filled with king salmon trips, followed by pursuit of September coho salmon.\nMy summer king season always begins in Sitka around Memorial Day weekend, as this was my 24 th year fishing this nirvana of king salmon fisheries with longtime fishing buddies. King salmon nirvana was not the case this year as my group of six boated the lowest catch rate of those 24 years. Break out the violins.\nIn June, I spent the greater share of the month waiting for Westport to turn on which was now you see ‘em, now you don’t. The winds blew, and blew and blew, which seemed to be the dominant pattern as the kings remained, for the most part, invisible. You’ve got to be tough and patient to commit a steady fishing pattern in Westport as the Northwest winds blast the central coast for a greater part of the summer. You can easily identify a Westport angler as their hair is pasted strait back, without the gel. Or, they don’t have any hair remaining as the result of constant sandblasting from these conditions. I don’t have the luxury of losing any more hair!\n\n  In mid-July, I migrated north to Tahsis on Vancouver Island for my eighth year of king salmon fishing up there. I love fishing the kelp beds at Ferrer Island, working water from 70-90 feet, down 25-30 with a naked whole herring. Mercy! Offshore northwest winds can also plague this fishery outside of Esparanza Inlet but, no problem, kelp beds work for me and the wind is usually minimal on these inshore locations. And the payoff is plenty of king salmon, all day long. Back to king salmon nirvana.\nImmediately after Tahsis, I boogied for Neah Bay for a week. Waddah Island at daylight, Skagway, and Makah Bay delivered king salmon for me again, for the fourth year in a row. One of my favorite fisheries anywhere is hugging the deck in 30-feet of water, trolling around 3.0 mph and waiting for the take down. Kaboom and down goes Frazier!!! Like so many other areas, a king here and there throughout the day, but the kings light up the pinball machine while spitting silver dollars on current changes. Money, baby!\nThe big surprise this past summer had to be Willapa Bay. It took off in early mid-August, weeks before the Labor Day traditional peak, and it never quit. Consistent and impressive, day after day, with quality, mint-bright fat kings. This fishery is a high slack bite fishery. People who know how to fish it, primarily working the navigational marker line between marker 8-15 is a popular zone. Never overlook Toke Pt. or Washaway Beach, too. I like working marker 13, late in the flood, on the north side of the marker, which offers the deepest water for kings to hang, waiting to migrate up into the Willapa River and the Willapa Salmon Hatchery. High water, dude, day in, day out. Get it on next summer’s fishing calendar. It stays good until the gillnets bomb the bay, always on the second Sunday of September. Game over.\nFinally, I spent six days fishing the lower Columbia in mid-August. In recent years, fishing the surf line in front of Long Beach, or above and below the Megler-Astoria Bridge, I’ve averaged 20-25 kings during this time frame in recent years. This year, 20 kings, mostly adipose fin-clipped hatchery-produced kings hit the deck on my Osprey. Welcome aboard! Big fun and a wonderful trip, despite the tough warm water conditions. I’ll be back, in 2016, and my reservations are already locked.\n\nIn early September, I migrated back up to the northwest region of our state at Sekiu, fishing for coho salmon and attempting to troll surface flies for “nice” coho commonly called “bucktailing.” Weather conditions were good, despite the first low pressure system of the fall, but the coho salmon crushed our flies as I hunted for riptides straight north of Sekiu in 550 feet of water. Every year, like clockwork, Puget Sound coho salmon stocks create a traffic jam in the western Strait of Juan de Fuca equivalent of I-5 in downtown Seattle at 5 o’clock, waiting for a low pressure system to trigger their eastern migration. This fishery is big fun and completely under-utilized. Put this one on your 2016 fishing calendar also and get ready to be a convert! Simply spool out 50-60 feet of line, start trolling about 5-6 mph and keep your eyes locked on the fly. The coho will come to the fly, as their dorsal fin and back will break surface immediately behind the fly in preparation of the attack. Ka-boom and your rod explodes from a vertical trolling position to horizontal. Game on! It is critically important that your coho fly skim the surface of the water. If the fly dips under the surface, increase your speed. If the fly bounces above the surface, decrease your speed or release another 10-15 feet of line. Big fun!\nFinally, Grays Harbor recently opened on September 16 th for coho salmon. This fishery is a little over an hour from Olympia and the incoming tide through high slack has been delivering plenty of quality coho. When the coho are in the South Channel, working 20-25 feet of water with a fast spinning bait, it’s not uncommon to have a 20 fish day.\nThere, I’m done with the summer of 2016, likely remembered for the drought, forest fires and the destruction caused by those conditions. I suspect we will pay a conservation price in two to three years when the progeny of chinook and coho salmon return back to Washington. I say, thank God for salmon hatcheries. While some constantly criticize salmon hatchery production, I appreciate their existence supporting poor returns of wild stocks, hammered by environmental conditions such as drought and floods. May the legislature continue to support the necessary funds to keep the production going forever. Amen!\nSo where do we go from here? October and November can be tough months on the saltwater, looking for the oncoming blackmouth crop, along with pursuing late coho and the occasional chum salmon. Right behind the next two months will be the Area 7 (San Juan Islands) blackmouth opener and here we go again!
