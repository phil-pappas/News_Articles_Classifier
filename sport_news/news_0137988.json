Syracuse divided into teams of U.S., Canadian and European players for a series of round-robin games.\nEurope breezed to a series of easy decisions behind Joel Vermin, whom coach Rob Zettler said was the best player on the pitch.\n\"He was good. He could kick it. And you could tell he loved it. He was right into it. He'd bend it, kick it with some steam on it,'' Zettler said.\nVermin grew up in Switzerland and played the sport throughout his youth. He agreed with Zettler's assessment of him as the Crunch's top soccer player, although he didn't seem to place much value in that title.\n\"I mean, it wasn't too hard to be best soccer player on that team, to be honest. Those guys couldn't even kick the ball properly,'' Vermin said.\nThe Crunch also got a chance to see how that sport is executed for real when it went to a Lyon Champions League contest.\n\"It was a great experience because Champions League is really the top level of European soccer. It was really nice ambiance,'' Vermin said.\n\"To me, that was a pretty special moment. I've never seen that type of soccer before, that type of atmosphere in a building,'' Zettler said. \"Just the people, the passion, the fires in the crowd. There was flares being set off. People love soccer, obviously, in Europe. It was neat to see that kind of passion in the crowd.\n\"I think a lot of guys were kind of wide-eyed. A lot of guys had their phones out and videoing and taking pictures. It was fun just to take it all in and see how they celebrate their soccer over there.''\nContact Lindsay Kramer anytime: Email | Twitter | 315-470-2151", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/LindsayKramerPS"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:26:48.223+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
