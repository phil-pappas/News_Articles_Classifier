Bentonville had nothing to show for its first two possessions, both of which started in Springdale territory as a result of a foiled fake punt attempt and a Logan Darby interception. \n\"I'm not very pleased at all with the way we played offensively, to be completely honest,\" Bentonville coach Jody Grant said. \"We're not doing like we talk about. We're not operating and doing things. \n\"Quite frankly, if we don't get this fixed, we're in trouble.\" \nBentonville didn't get on the scoreboard until Darby picked up his second interception at the Tigers 35. Kasey Ford then hit Kam'Ron Mays-Hunt nine plays later for the first of two touchdown passes, this one from 9 yards out with 10 minutes, 49 seconds before halftime. \nThe Tigers' defense finished with three interceptions off Springdale quarterback Jack Lindsey, and took care of the scoring with the last one. Linebacker Brandon Atchison stepped in front of a Bulldog receiver to pick off Lindsey's pass and ran 20 yards for a score in the third quarter. \n\"We couldn't get much going offensively,\" Springdale coach Zak Clark said. \"I thought we were close at times. I thought the story was up front. They did a good job of minimizing our running game, which was kind of non-existent. \n\"At times we played really well on offense, just not enough. We were close on some, but more than anything they're a good football team. That's what they do -- make things tough on you.\" \nSpringdale (1-6, 1-3) made it 14-3 on John Bautista's 42-yard field goal with under a minute before halftime, and Jayden Minchew recovered an onside kick to start the second half. The Red'Dogs, however, had a holding penalty negate a 48-yard touchdown pass from Lindsey to Hunter Necessary, then they never threatened again. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:00:44.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
