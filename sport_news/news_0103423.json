Jean Nagy / Boston.com Inman Square is known for restaurants such as Tupelo , Ginger Exchange , Puritan & Company , Oleana , East Coast Grill & Bar , and more. Chef Dan Bazzinotti, who opened his restaurant Bisq in June, calls it a “kind of a hidden little area,” ripe for more growth.\nBazzinotti, whose restaurant features shareable small plates and charcuterie, said businesses in the square have been very hospitable. Puritan & Company, which serves modern American cuisine down the street, brought his staff lunch one day.\n“It was really awesome,” said Bazzinotti. “It was a great, friendly ‘Welcome to the neighborhood.’”\nAnd others are taking note.\n“It’s more relaxed than Central Square and Harvard Square,” said Antonio Gomes, owner of Bom Cafe. “It’s fantastic. You have everything here.”\nBisq and other Inman Square restaurants shared the following fall recipes with us. They hope their recipes both inspire you in the kitchen and entice you to explore Inman Square.\nMAIN ENTREE\nPumpkin Gnocchi, aka, ?little pillows of love,? from Bisq.\nChef Dan Bazzinotti makes pumpkin gnocchi at Bisq. Jean Nagy / Boston.com Bazzinotti’s fall menu at Bisq (short for “Bergamot Inman Square,” since it was launched by the same team behind Somerville’s Bergamot) features pumpkin gnocchi.\n“They’re just perfect for fall,” said Bazzinotti. “I call them my little pillows of love.”\nHow easy is it to make gnocchi at home?\n“It’s pretty easy,” said Bazzinotti. “I don’t typically cook at home very fancy at all, and gnocchi is one of those things I would make at home.”\nIngredients:\n- 1 can of pumpkin puree\nor make your own puree with the following ingredients:\n- A fresh pumpkin (between 3-5 lbs)\n- 1/2 white onion\n- 1 tablespoon of garlic\n- 1 cinnamon stick\n- 2 tablespoons of Kosher salt\n- 1/2 cup of brown sugar\nFor dough:\n- 2 cups of warm pumpkin puree\n- 2 whole eggs\n- 2 egg yolks\n- 4-5 cups of all-purpose flour\nTo make the puree: Peel and de-seed pumpkin and cut into even, large chunks. Place all ingredients in a pot and add enough water to cover pumpkin. Cook on low until pumpkin is soft all the way through. Remove pumpkin from the liquid and puree in a food processor or mash.\nFor the dough: In a bowl, mix the puree with the eggs and yolks and slowly add flour until the dough comes together and is somewhat firm.\nRoll and cut your gnocchi and drop them into salted boiling water until they float, then count to 30 and remove. Finally, toss them with your sauce.\nServes 4\nWINE\nRecommendations from Bisq\nPair your comfort food with white wine. Jean Nagy / Boston.com Bisq sommelier Anne Thompson recommends pairing white wine with your comfort foods this fall.\n“White wine doesn’t have tannins or bitterness in the same way that red wines do,” said Thompson. “So I think it’s actually a lot more versatile with food.”\nShe’d choose a Riesling to accompany Bazzinotti’s pumpkin gnocchi. If Riesling is too sweet, Thompson recommended going with a Shenin blanc instead.\nAPPETIZER\nCheese bread at Bom Cafe\nThis cheese bread, or pao de queijo, is popular at Bom Cafe. Jean Nagy / Boston.com Bom Cafe loves serving folks coffee.\n“Coffee, for us in Brazil, is time for a little chat,” said Gomes, owner of the cozy Brazilian coffee shop. “It’s very friendly.”\nBut don’t discount the cafe’s light American and Brazilian fare — namely its famous Brazilian cheese bread (or pao de queijo ).\n“It’s like popcorn,” said Gomes, with a laugh. “You want to eat more and more.”\nIngredients:\n- 1 pound of tapioca flour\n- 1 tablespoon or less of salt\n- 2 cups of milk\n- 1 cup of olive or canola oil\n- 2 large eggs\n- 3 cups of grated hard parmesan cheese\nPreparation:\nIn a large bowl, place the tapioca flour and open a hole in the center like a volcano. Place the milk, oil, and salt in a large pan and boil it. Pour this mixture over the tapioca and mix it all with a wooden spoon. Let it cool down. Add the eggs and grated cheese and work on the dough until it is all well incorporated. Grease your hands and make small balls and place in a baking pan. Or fill the holds of a small muffin pan. Place the cheese bread in the oven at 300 degrees for about 20-25 minutes.\nSALAD\nRoasted Delicata Squash Salad at Puritan Company\nThe roasted delicata squash salad at Puritan & Company. Jean Nagy / Boston.com Will Gilson, the chef at Puritan & Company, cooks New England-focused modern cuisine. The restaurant pays homage to the building’s history — the Puritan Cake Company resided there about 80 years ago. Here, Gilson shares his recipe for roasted squash salad.\nIngredients:\n- 1 delicata squash, seeded and cut into 1/2-inch pieces\n- 2 cups of romanesco florets\n- 2 cups of hen of the woods mushrooms\n- 8 cups of cipollini onions, blanched\n- 4 farm eggs\n- 2 tablespoons of olive oil\n- 4 tablespoons of butter\n- 2 tablespoons of sherry\n- 1 tablespoon of lemon juice\n- salt and pepper to taste\nTo assemble: Toss the squash, romanesco, onions, and mushrooms in a bowl with the olive oil, salt, and pepper. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the vegetables in batches until they are browned on all sides and cooked through. Cook the eggs sunny side up in a non-stick pan. Heat the butter in a pan until it browns and add the sherry and lemon juice to make the dressing. Place one egg on each plate and top it with the roasted vegetables. Spoon the warm dressing over the top of the vegetables. Serve warm.\nServes 4\nDESSERT\nPlum Fresh Ginger Wheat Drop Scones from The Biscuit\nThe plum fresh ginger wheat drop scones from The Biscuit. Jean Nagy / Boston.com Andrew Platt, owner of The Biscuit, has lived and worked in and around Inman Square for two decades. He used to work at 1369 Coffee House and also at the old Daddy-O’s (where Oleana now resides). He opened The Biscuit in 2004 with his wife, Greta. He shared this scone recipe from his bakery.\nIngredients:\n- 3 cups of whole wheat flour\n- 1 cup of unbleached white flour\n- 1 cup of granulated sugar\n- 1/4 cup of grated fresh ginger — grated finely, removing threads\n- 2 tablespoons of baking powder\n- 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon\n- 1 teaspoon of ground dried ginger\n- 1/2 teaspoon of ground nutmeg\n- 1/4 stick of butter, cubed\n- 2 cups of buttermilk\n- 4 cups of sliced fresh plums\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a cookie sheet with unwaxed parchment paper. No oil is required. Using a stand mixer with a beater attachment, combine dry ingredients, fresh grated ginger, and cubed butter. Mix on medium speed for 2 to 3 minutes, until butter is broken down and dry mix resembles a cornmeal texture. Stop mixer.\nAdd fresh sliced plums and buttermilk. Mix for about 30 seconds, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl occasionally. Remove scone mixture from bowl and pour out onto a lightly floured surface. Using a bench scraper, roughly cut the mixture into eight pieces, placing the eight segments on to the edges of th elined cookie sheet. Bake for approximately 20 to 25 mintues, rotating the sheet occasionally, until the tops of the scones are slightly colored and the bottoms are lightly browned.
