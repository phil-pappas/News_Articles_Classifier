On Tuesday, defensive lineman Sheldon Richardson said the Jets are salivating at the thought of getting after Tom Brady, Bill Belichick and the Patriots. \"He's run this division for a while so I am kind of happy we get next,\" Richardson told reporters. \"We're getting after it.\" Richardson didn’t’ specify whether he was talking about Brady or Belichick but added, \"I mean, they are the Super Bowl champions. Just leave it at that. You know, licking our chops.” Richardson and the Jets have a defense built – on paper – to slow down the Patriots offense. Entering this week, the Jets are ranked first in the NFL allowing 1,346 total yards. Their secondary – led with Darrelle Revis – is ranked second allowing an average of 186.6 passing yards per game. Their run defense is also ranked No 2, allowing an average of 82.6 rush yards per contest. Under new head coach Todd Bowles, Belichick said the Jets are running a similar defensive scheme that they have in years past. “They have a lot of talented players… it’s really pretty much the same defense,” Belichick said. “They put pressure on you. There’s a good amount of pressure with extra linebackers and then there are times when they bring secondary players as well. I’d say that’s consistent with what they did in Arizona and even a little bit in Miami, so not really anything dramatically different from what we’ve seen from him in the past, but they are doing it very well and they have good players at every position, so that will definitely be a big challenge for us.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:45:37.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
