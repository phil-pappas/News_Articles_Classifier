According to an Associated Press report , that may soon happen. Steve Greenberg, the managing director of Allen & Co., told the AP that the addition of a minority investor could be completed this year.\n\"The franchise is very stable,\" Dolan said at the end of August. \"Ownership is stable. We've said from the outset that, under the right circumstances, we would look for a minority investor. We're not in a hurry. If the right circumstances come along, we'll do it.\"\nGreenberg told the AP that he didn't think the presence of a minority partner would \"be that kind of a game-changer.\" The Indians' payroll has ranked among the bottom third of the league's 30 teams each year since 2003, according to Cot's Contracts.\nDolan has been adamant that he has no intention of selling the family's majority share. The New York Post reported in August that the Indians were looking to sell about 30 percent of the team.\nLarry Dolan, Paul's father, purchased the Indians for $323 million following the 1999 season. Paul Dolan was named the organization's control person in January 2013.\nThe Indians drew just 1,388,905 fans to Progressive Field this season, the lowest figure in the ballpark's 22-year history. The Indians averaged 17,806 fans per home game, which ranked ahead of only Tampa Bay. Last year, when the Indians also finished 29th in attendance, the team drew 18,428 fans per contest. Cleveland has ranked in the bottom three in attendance in each of the last four years.", "external_links": ["http://bigstory.ap.org/article/2cfc57da86f745469c00f30c3bfda03f/cleveland-indians-may-soon-have-minority-investor", "http://nypost.com/2015/08/28/the-indians-want-a-new-minority-owner-but-the-price-isnt-right/"], "published": "2015-10-09T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:15:31.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
