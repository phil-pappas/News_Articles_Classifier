Alexis Sanchez then capped off a fine interchange between he and Arturo Vidal in the 90th minute to secure the points for the hosts. \nBrazil, who were playing their first World Cup qualifier in six years, were without the services of Barcelona star Neymar as he serves the remainder of a four-game international suspension. \nWorld Cup 2014 runners-up Argentina, missing Lionel Messi and forced to cope with the early exit of Sergio Aguero, began their journey to Russia with a shock 2-0 defeat to Ecuador in Buenos Aires. \nFrickson Erazo gave the visitors the lead with a header from a corner kick in the 81st minute, before Felipe Caicedo swept home a lighting-fast counterattack just a minute later to give the Ecuadorians a famous victory at the Estadio Monumental. \nUruguay made light work of 10-man Bolivia in La Paz, winning 2-0. \nDespite the absence of suspended pair Luis Suarez or Edinson Cavani, Uruguay were always in control and led in the 10th minute when Martin Caceres fired home a loose ball from close range. \nSkipper David Godin made the game safe with 21 minutes remaining when he headed home Carlos Sanchez's cross to double the lead. \nAnd a first ever away win in Bolivia was made safer as the hosts were reduced to 10 men two minutes later when Jair Torrico saw red for two yellow cards. \nColombia also got off to a winning start as they beat Peru 2-0 in Barranquilla. \nTeofilo Gutierrez put them in front nine minutes before the break as he converted from a corner and the game was put to bed at the death as Edwin Cardona fired in a second from a quick counter attack. \nIt was a testing afternoon for the hosts, though, with Paolo Guerro hitting the post in the second half. \nParaguay left it late to beat Venezuela as they triumphed 1-0. \nA stalemate looked on the cards until Derlis Gonzalez popped up with the winner in the 85th minute. \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
