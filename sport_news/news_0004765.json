His 'golden' shoes will be a centre piece of our exhibition,\" said museum director Manuel Neukirchner.\nAs well as reliving some historic moments, visitors also get to test their on-camera skills in a multimedia exhibit about the work of a sports reporter.\nA tour lasts around 90 minutes and afterwards, in the museum's restaurant, hungry fans can sample the dishes that fuelled the Mannschaft's footwork in Brazil last year.\nThe museum's emphasis is on the national team rather than Bundesliga clubs.\n\"The national team is our key element as clubs so often have their own museums, so it is difficult to get hold of certain memorabilia,\" explained Neukirchner.\nAt 17 euros per ticket ($18.84) a visit is not cheap, but Neukirchner defended the pricing policy.\n\"We are not a state museum and do not receive grants,\" he said. \"In order to cover costs, we need 270,000 visitors a year.\n\"Our admission fees are not higher than a general admission ticket to a Bundesliga game.\"\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T14:09:06.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
