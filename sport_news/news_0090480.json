(Photo: Srdjan Suki, EPA)\n1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE AUSTIN, Texas – Alexander Rossi’s bid to remain the first American driving in the Formula 1 series for nearly a decade is at a critical juncture.\nBecause another chance is unlikely to materialize if he doesn’t exploit his current five-race trial with Manor Marussia F1, he said. Or unless he finds a backer or a team willing to sign him full-time beginning next season.\nThat doesn’t heighten pressure this weekend at the United States Grand Prix at Circuit of the Americas, where he has been a heavily leveraged spokesperson for the series’ only domestic event. The pressure is just business as usual, and the potential finality of the opportunity is simply a reality he’s long understood.\n“This is really the one shot, I think,” the 24-year-old Californian told USA TODAY Sports. “I don’t really know how successful another attempt will be if it doesn’t come off next year. So I have a very strong team of people around me that are working to make it happen and I have high confidence that it will happen. But, yeah, in terms of how important it is, it is the most important thing for me to make it happen because I don’t know if I will be in a race seat in the future if it doesn’t.”\nUSA TODAY\nRomain Grosjean will drive for Gene Haas' Formula One team\nRossi’s late-season trial with threadbare Manor crystallized in five days after Will Stevens – pointless in 13 races – was displaced by the team. In came Rossi, who has won three races and is second in the standings in the developmental GP2 series with Racing Engineering. Rossi was 14th of 20 at Singapore and next-to-last in a 19-car field at Japan.\nInvolved as a test driver and in line for various promotions that never came in recent seasons, Rossi is the first American to race in the series since Scott Speed spent all of 2006 and half of 2007 with Scuderia Toro Rosso before being replaced by eventual four-time series champion Sebastian Vettel.\nRossi doesn’t have a job for 2016 or crucial sponsorship to offer potential suitors. He’s retained a management group to solicit both, but the only expected openings in Formula 1 next season are one seat at Lotus and two with Manor. Conversations that began before his Formula 1 chance have become “a lot more positive” now that he has something to showcase, he said, but his Austin weekend will be as much about hustling sponsors and teams as navigating around the 3.4-mile course.\nUSA TODAY\nA third F1 world title would secure legacy for Lewis Hamilton\nConversations with American owner Gene Haas were “quickly extinguished” during the summer, Rossi said, when it became apparent Haas sought experienced drivers for his inaugural season in 2016. Telegraph Sport reported this week that Manor – which will switch from Ferrari to ostensibly more competitive Mercedes engines in 2016 – is demanding in excess of $10 million from Stevens to return.\n“It’s always a very difficult time of year figuring out what’s happening and what’s really available,” Rossi said. “It’s a very competitive environment at the moment, so I have five Grand Prix, three remaining, to maximize that on-track opportunity and to show that I deserve to be in the sport.”\nAnd that, he said, is nothing new.\n“The thing about motorsports is you’re only as good as your last race and that remains true all the way from go karts,” Rossi said. “You do the best that you can, but at the same time you realize you’ve never really arrived unless you’re a two-time world champion-type thing.\n“No matter what you’re doing, there’s always doubt and there’s always people you need to prove wrong. So I don’t think me having five grand prix opportunities really changes the amount of pressure I’m used to.”\nManor driver Alexander Rossi during the first practice session for the Formula One U.S. Grand Prix at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin on Friday. (Photo: John Locher, AP)\nRossi believes his nationality enabled his F1 debut as a reserve and test driver with England-based Caterham in 2012.\n“That came solely on the back that I was an American and there was massive American corporation in GE and Intel and for them to have an American driver made a lot of sense,” he said.\nZak Brown, executive chairman of Just Marketing, Inc., which specializes in motorsports, said Formula 1 can provide the global exposure that neither NASCAR nor IndyCar can, but said Rossi’s conundrum will be proving he’s worthy of such an investment.\n“You can’t get a sponsor to get you to play center field for the Yankees, but you can get a sponsor to put you on the grid of a Formula 1 race or an IndyCar race,” Brown told USA TODAY Sports in a phone interview. “What he needs to do is either impress the big teams enough with the equipment he has and he doesn’t have to worry about picking up the economics, or if that doesn’t happen or until that happens, he has to do what a decent part of the grid does, which is go find backers.\nUSA TODAY\nSebastian Vettel, Ferrari get 10-spot penalty for engine change\n“He needs to find people passionate about the sport. Unfortunately, Formula 1 in North America probably isn’t popular enough for an America corporation to jump all over it, so it’s going to need to be someone who sees the benefit of Formula 1 globally and because they’re U.S.-based has the benefit of a U.S. driver.”\nRossi said his team has contingency plans but is currently completely focused on Formula 1. IndyCar – which continues to grope for successful and marketable Americans - remains a possibility after he nearly joined the North American open wheel series last season with Dale Coyne Racing.\n“I was very, very close to going IndyCar racing last year,” Rossi said. “I was probably days away from signing a deal to race IndyCar this year. I developed a lot of good contacts in the IndyCar paddock from last winter and I still have those contacts. IndyCar is difficult in its own right in that just like Formula 1, there’s not enough seats for the available drivers. I’d like to think I have something to offer coming from Europe and Formula 1 and definitely that is recognized. But at the same time, it’s not a cakewalk to get into IndyCar.”\nSo he works, and he waits for a deal. As usual.\n“My ideal world, for simple peace of mind, I’d like to see it before the end of the calendar year,” he said. “In reality, how this stuff works, it’s probably mid-to-late January from a realistic expectation.”\nFollow James on Twitter @brantjames\n1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812134680506565-EPA-USA-FORMULA-ONE-GRAND-PRIX.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/03884eaa077a92901d5b5ec038c46fa678fb4dee/c=854-32-2593-1771/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/usatsports/20f0bd6f7d4d912f850f6a706700374e.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LSFxGn&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1f83f494db49a989387b4889dfa0005599fc7181/c=315-0-3249-2934/local/-/media/2015/10/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/635811418328645537-2015-10-22-Sebastian-Vettel.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f54789928e87a420480c7aaef75b7803c219135c/c=322-315-3355-2596&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812134680506565-EPA-USA-FORMULA-ONE-GRAND-PRIX.jpg", "http://twitter.com/brantjames", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/69999b2159885856ad147989c5f5606651aa6279/c=0-30-533-331&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/09/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/635791268487443808-635791201176001709-AFP-543558665.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LSFxGn&text=American%20Alexander%20Rossi%20faces%20key%20moment%20in%20F1%20career&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/583e0d5b65be166671ff5449350fd0634e3733d9/c=308-0-3500-2400&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812139730882939-AP-F1-US-Grand-Prix-Auto-Racing.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/77c65a214d325e13ce7558bb23f45ce14358e95d/r=500x316/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812134680506565-EPA-USA-FORMULA-ONE-GRAND-PRIX.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-24T00:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:59:22.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
