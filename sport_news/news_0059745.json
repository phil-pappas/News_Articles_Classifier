Franklin, File) ( Ross D. Franklin ) \nBut given the deeper and darker possibilities that abound, things also could be a lot worse for Tomsula's crew these days. \nThere could be zero life in this franchise. Thanks to some of the things 49ers management has done lately, we probably should expect a flat-line eventually. \nBut on Sunday, at least, there was life. It wasn't enough, but it also wasn't a dead team walking. \nIt's a start. \n\"There was a resolve, a determination, but also you could see a joy,\" Tomsula said Monday, a day after the team's spirited 30-27 loss to the New York Giants. \n\"That's what I really appreciate about this group, when you go through tough times. Obviously we're not hiding from the facts; it's a tough stretch here for the Niners. And it pulls your glue. Pulls at it ... Advertisement \n\"But these guys won't let it snap. They just keep pulling it tight. And I believe in that, and I believe in guys that are willing to earn it. And that's what we have.\" \nThese are just words, of course, and words mean nothing in the NFC West standings when you're knocking around with Arizona, Seattle and St. Louis. \nIf this doesn't get turned around quickly -- starting Sunday at Levi's against the 1-4 Baltimore Ravens -- all the built-up goodwill could vaporize very quickly. \nAfter Baltimore comes a Thursday night home game against Seattle, and then a trip to St. Louis, then home against currently undefeated Atlanta, then a bye, then a trip to Seattle. \nThere aren't a lot of gimmes on this schedule, basically. \nBut the 49ers, led by Kaepernick's revival, definitely played tougher and better -- and happier -- in North New Jersey than they did against Arizona and Green Bay in the previous two weeks. \nAnd it's fair for Tomsula and his players to cite the energy level and enthusiasm as a sign of better things to come. \nIt even sounds like they believe it, which gets them extra credit. \nGrading on a curve, you know. \n\"To be honest with you, I don't feel like we're 1-4,\" defensive lineman Quinton Dial said Monday. \"I feel like we a have a lot of talent in that locker room. We need to finish games. That's what we have to do. \n\"The talent we have in the locker room is just crazy.\" \nThere is talent on this roster, and for the first time since Week 1's victory over Minnesota, the 49ers proved it Sunday night. \nKaepernick played with confidence for the first time in a while, the offensive line was sturdy, Aaron Lynch rushed the passer, and the 49ers kept rallying back on the road against the Giants. \nIf not for the defense's complete collapse in the fourth quarter against Eli Manning, the 49ers might be 2-3 right now. \nBut they lost, they're 1-4, and the defense's inability to cover Giants tailback Shane Vereen in the final minutes does point to some major schematic issues. \nThe 49ers aren't a good team -- that's how you get to 1-4 and that's what they're showing every week. \nThey're on a four-game losing streak, and they have been hearing outside chatter about their decline for many weeks now. \nBut Tomsula is a man who knows the beat of that locker room -- for now, he's holding it together. \n\"I don't spend a lot of time and I don't think these guys do on opinions from outside,\" Tomsula said. \"And thank God that we don't. \n\"We have to talk about the realities from the inside out, and that's where, as far as from my chair, I try to keep it.\" \nIn the face of grand disappointment, the 49ers haven't given up; that's a tiny consolation for fans and players, but for now it will have to do. \nThese are small victories within larger defeats, and the 49ers are already getting used to accepting both.
