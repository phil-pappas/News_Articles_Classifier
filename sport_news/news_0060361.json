From that standpoint, it’s a wonder he’s been able to recruit running backs to play in an offense where they don’t get too many opportunities to actually run the ball. So, coach, what’s the recruiting pitch when you sit in a high school tailback’s home and ask him to come play in the Air Raid? “By position, it’s not unusual for our running backs to have more yards that running backs at other schools when you add the yards in the air and on the ground,” Leach said. “And when you look at the running backs (who play) on Sundays, depending on which team you’re talking about in the NFL, that’s what they do. They’re required to block, run and catch.” Thus, the recruiting pitch is this: Come to Washington State because with us, you’ll get “a closer parallel to what they do in the NFL,” Leach said. “And as a position, they come away with more yards, often times.” The Cougars go into this Saturday’s game against Arizona averaging 86.8 rushing yards per game. That doesn’t sound like much, but it’s the highest they’ve managed in the Leach era at WSU, and more than double what they put up last season. As Oregon coach Mark Helfrich puts it, WSU has “just enough of a run game to keep you balanced as they do their deal.” Current Pac-12 stats don’t really support Leach’s theory that his running backs have more total offensive yards than traditional tailbacks from other schools – Stanford’s Ed McCaffrey averages 229.8 all-purpose yards per game, Oregon’s Royce Freeman averages 173 all-purpose yards per game, while Utah’s Devontae Booker averages about 171.8. But that might be due to the running back-by-committee approach the Cougars have taken this season with Gerard Wicks, Keith Harrington and Jamal Morrow getting equal reps in the rotation. Tally up their stats, and Leach looks to be right. Together, the Cougars’ three backs have averaged about 168.9 all-purpose yards per game this season. If all that came from a single player, that theoretical superstar Cougar running back would rank fourth behind Utah’s Booker on the Pac-12’s list of top all-purpose yardage producers this year. Still, fortunately or unfortunately, depending on which way you choose to look at it, none of the Cougars’ backs has done enough to vault over the other two and become the undisputed starter. “If one of them truly separated himself and did it completely, that would elevate his number of reps and whoever (else) would play behind him,” Leach told reporters after practice on Tuesday. As it stands, each member of the Cougars’ running back committee has distinguished himself in a different way. Morrow (112 rush yards, 96 rec yards, 2 receiving TD) is the resident jack-of-all-trades. “He’s versatile. He’s a decent blocker, decent ball carrier, decent at catching the ball out of the backfield,” Leach said. “I think the other two backs have single strengths that are stronger, but overall, in all three phases, he’s probably got the best overall game.” Wicks (288 rush yards, 116 rec yards, 1 rush TD) is the most bruising runner of the three, though Leach takes issue with his blocking. “Wicks, if he decides to block, blocks real well,” Leach said. “He’s a work in progress. But he’s very physical.” Harrington (186 rush yards, 174 rec yards 1 rush TD, 2 rec TD), however, has great hands, and he’s often the guy the Cougars look to on the screen passes that are so ubiquitous in the offense. Together, the Cougars’ three co-starters have caught the attention of opposing coaches this season. Gary Andersen warned his team about WSU’s emerging run game before Oregon State played the Cougars last weekend, and Arizona’s Rich Rodriguez is taking notes too. “Scheme-wise offensively, everyone thinks they’ll throw it all the time,” Rodriguez said. “But they hurt us a couple years ago with the run game, and they’ll run it.” Rodriguez has reason to be wary. The last time the Wildcats hosted WSU in the desert in 2013, the Cougars snuck away with a 24-17 win, with running backs Marcus Mason and Teondray Caldwell combining for 110 rushing yards and a touchdown. “They have some really good running backs, they have as good skill players as anyone in our league, and their offensive line is all veterans,” Rodriguez said this week. The Cougars’ three running all get along well and are always rooting for one another, Morrow says. There are no divas in the running backs meeting room, it seems, and they have embraced their game day rotation. “Coach (Jim) Mastro really preaches that if you feel like you can’t go 100 percent, take yourself out,” Morrow said. The Cougars have a loose rotation on game days that’s based occasionally on the type of formation they’re in. But for the most part, WSU rolls with whichever back has the hot hand. “If it’s a certain package, me and Keith might go in, and in a certain package, Gerard goes in,” Morrow said. “There’s no determined back. We’re all going to get in, and whoever is the hot guy, we just go.” More like this story", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:12:39.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
