It was pretty hard to get your footing,” said junior Alexander Laucius, who topped Skyline’s boys with a fifth-place time of 16 minutes, 40 seconds. \n“We got off to a pretty solid start. We didn’t go out too crazy. We started pretty relaxed and I think that was a good strategy.” \nInglemoor seniors Nick Laccinole and Gavin Parpart shared the winning time of 16:03, and led the Vikings to the team victory with 24 points. Skyline scored 39 and Mount Si had 57. \nWilliam Kimball (sixth, 16:42), Makennan Hurd (seventh, 16:43), Connor Edson (10th, 16:53) and Amrit Krishnan (11th, 17:00) rounded out Skyline’s top five. \nLaucius, who’s known as “Zanny” to his friends, said racing without Ganz didn’t change the Spartans’ strategy much. Ganz has the 25th-best 5-kilometer time among 4A athletes, and he figures to be crucial to Skyline’s chances of being one of 16 teams at next month’s state championships in Pasco. \nWhile more important races lie ahead, Laucius said it was good to compete against two solid KingCo rivals. \n“It’s important to keep consistently racing, keep good habits, so that you know that you have to stick with those guys now,” he said. “We’re going to have to stick with them at KingCo and districts.” \nThe girls’ race featured two of the state’s best 4A squads: Mount Si was ranked second and Skyline was seventh in the Oct. 5 cross country coaches’ association poll. \nMount Si scored 36 points to defeat Skyline (42) and Inglemoor (64). Lindsey Sydnor, Chloe Cosgrove and Julene McDonald locked up second through fourth places to lead the Wildcats. \nBut the Spartans weren’t far behind. Their top five, led by junior Jennifer Tidball, finished within 38 seconds of each other. \n“The conditions made it a lot harder, but our team really worked together and pushed each other, and we worked with Mount Si, too,” said Tidball, who was sixth overall in 19:27. \n“It was nice to actually compete against them because we’ve really just been looking at standings before this.” \nAlex Pletcher (seventh, 19:28), Callie Juetten (eighth, 19:36), Geneva Schlepp (10th, 20:05) and Sonia Grutzius (11th, 20:05) were the Spartans’ other scorers. \nSkyline finishes the regular season Oct. 14 against Redmond and Skyline, then heads to the KingCo championships, Oct. 24 at Lake Sammamish State Park.
