(Image Source: Brad Penner/USA TODAY Sports) \nHere’s a look at the Sunday Night Football matchup between the New York Giants and the San Francisco 49ers: \nSeries: Tied at 15-15; Streaks: Giants won 4 of past 6; Last Meeting: 49ers 16, Giants 10 (11.16.14) \nTime: 8:30 PM ET; TV: NBC (Al Michaels, Cris Collinsworth & Michelle Tafoya) \nSpread: Giants -7; O/U 43 \nInjury Report: 49ers: Out: TE Vernon Davis (knee); Doubtful: LB Ahmad Brooks (not injury related, shoulder); Questionable: WR Quinton Patton (concussion), T Joe Staley (knee); Probable: Alex Boone (shoulder, ankle), LB Navorro Bowman (not injury related), S L.J. McCray (knee), TE Vance McDonald (chest) \nGiants : Out: D Robert Ayers (hamstring), WR Victor Cruz (calf), LB Devon Kennard (hamstring), DE George Selvie (calf); Questionable: LB Jonathan Casillas (calf), CB Jayron Hosley (concussion), CB Trumaine McBride (groin); Probable: TE Jerome Cunningham (knee), T Ereck Flowers (ankle), DT Markus Kuhn (knee) \nWhere They Stand: These clubs are headed in opposite directions. After winning the season opener, the San Francisco 49ers have dropped three-straight games to fall to 1-3, in last place in the NFC West. They haven’t just lost three in row...they’ve lost all three by at least 14 points. Their minus-62 point differential is the worst in the NFL. The New York Giants dropped their first two games of the season, but have bounced back with a pair of double-digit victories to pull into a three-way tie with the Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins atop the NFC East. Their plus-20 point differential leads the NFC’s six 2-2 teams. \nThe 49ers: QB Colin Kaepernick has won his only start vs. the G-Men but is struggling this season, with two TD passes to just five INTs. His 6.27 YPP and 67.7 rating are on pace for career lows. There is talent surrounding him, although he will be without the services of TE Vernon Davis , who has caught 62 TDs since he was drafted in 2006, which is the third most among tight ends. In the offseason, they added big-play threat WR Torrey Smith , who is averaging 17 yards per catch since 2011, the second highest among pass catchers with at least 200 grabs. Smith and Quinton Patton both had 40-plus yard catches last week, while veteran Anquan Boldin leads the club with 15 receptions. On the ground, RB Carlos Hyde has taken over the starting duties, using his physical style to lead the team with 282 yards (4.5 YPC). All-purpose RB Reggie Bush is one of two players with over 5,000 rushing yards and 450 receptions. The QB play isn’t the only problem, as San Francisco has had to rebuild their defense. After missing the entire 2014 season, ILB NaVorro Bowman is back and he leads the Niners with his 28 tackles, while OLB Aaron Lynch (3 sacks) is emerging as their top pass rusher. \nThe Giants: QB issues, the G-Men do not have. Eli Manning has started 171-straight games, the longest-active streak in the NFL, and he’s 5-2 in his career against the Niners. He is coming off a three-TD effort against Buffalo in Week 4 giving him a seven-to-one INT ratio on the season. WR Odell Beckham Jr. has played a full season’s worth games and his 115 receptions and 1,612 receiving yards are an NFL record for the first 16 games to start a career. Stepping up this season opposite ODB is fellow LSU alum WR Rueben Randle , who has scored a TD in the past two games. WR Dwayne Harris came out of nowhere to catch five balls last week, while TE Larry Donnell is second on the club with 15 receptions. They employ a two-headed backfield, but neither Rashad Jennings (3.2 YPC), nor Andre Williams (3.3 YPC) has been able to get much traction as a runner this season. Without much of a pass rush, New York’s defensive playmakers are CB’s Prince Amukamara and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie . Amukamara has an INT and six PDs this season and DRC has scored six TDs in his career (5 INT-TDs, 1 FR-TD). First-year LB Uani’ Unga leads the team in both INTs (2) and tackles (28). \nPrediction: Coming into this contest no one is playing worse football than the 49ers, and that includes the winless Detroit Lions. The way they’re playing right now, I can’t imagine picking them to beat anyone on the road, let alone a Giants club that appears to have found themselves. Manning is passing at a high level, protecting the football, and they’re holding up much better than expected at the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball in pass pro and run stopping. \nScore: Giants 24, 49ers 13 \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
