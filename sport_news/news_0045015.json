He's a thing of beauty on throwing a football. His passing motion and his arm, frankly, you won't see a more gifted passer, power, accuracy, the entire aspect of it. If he can basically prepare, be the starting quarterback, come in and execute and keep his head right, then I feel good about Weeden.\" The latest from SportsLine Pete's Best Bets: Broncos ready to get right Sunday That last sentence is telling because after going 0-3, Weeden was benched this week for Matt Cassel .\nThe reason: Weeden and his beautiful passing motion were way too cautious, and the hope is that Cassel won't be afraid to take shots down the field.\n\"I think [Cassel's] also got experience in basically just stepping up in the pocket and making some plays,\" Jones told CBS Sports Radio's 105.3 The Fan . \"Now, he will, with that experience though, do something that Weeden was not doing. Weeden was so conservative, he was coached to be conservative to a degree, but he was not taking chances with that ball. Now, we know you can't make plays if you don't take some chances. So, we'll see more of that. We could see the risk of that hit us a little bit, but hopefully we'll be getting our share of them over on the defense with this group we've got.\"\nThe Cowboys traded for Cassel on September 22 so he likely doesn't have the same understanding of the offense as Weeden. But the Cowboys also can't wait around for Weeden to figure things out; the team is currently 2-3 and one game behind the Giants in the NFC East.\nIn Weeden's defense, he hasn't been terrible, he was just incapable of sparking the offense. In four appearances this season he completed 72.4 percent of his throws with two touchdowns, two interceptions and a 92.2 passer rating. Football Outsiders ranks him a middle-of-the-pack 16th in value per play.\nAlso worth remembering: Cassel doesn't magically fix things; there's a reason the Vikings traded him to the Bills in the offseason, and there's a reason the Bills did the same last month. Both teams had younger, better (and mostly unproven) options in Teddy Bridgewater and Tyrod Taylor .\nMeanwhile, Romo can't return to the field until November 22, though the Cowboys got some good news when wide receiver Dez Bryant returned to the practice field this week for the first time since breaking his foot in the opener.\nFor now, Cassel will be under center when the Cowboys face the Giants on October 25 -- assuming his wife delivers the latest member of the Cassel family before then. Matt Cassel looks to make his first start of the 2015 season.
