Richt is over. The season is over. It was over when I experienced no anger when we gave up an easy seven to Tennessee, no anger when we fumbled on the 25-yard line immediately after, and no anger when we eventually gave up the tying and go-ahead scores. I expected an easy seven to be given up at the end of the 1st half; unbeknownst to me, it would be an easy 14. Chubb exiting this game from the first play from scrimmage isn't the reason we lost...we actually had a great per average rush. The Reggie Davis drop isn't the reason we lost this game. We didn't lose this game because Tennessee's final punt made a left turn for Albuquerque and bounced out on the 1/2 yard line. We lost this game due to Coach Richt, plain and simple. This article will not go into stats, trends, and historical averages...if you want to brush up on that first, check out my article about Coach Richt and your relationship with him here , \nIt's over. Problem with the QB? So did LSU, Alabama, and Florida entering this year. In 2013, it was injuries. In 2014, it was Gurley's suspension...until it wasn't. Then it was Mason...until is wasn't. We entered this season with a stable of running backs and arguably the best offensive line we have seen in some time. Next year, we will have a freshman QB and an inexperienced offensive line. In 2017, our stud running backs will be gone. In 2018? An excuse awaits. \nIt's over. If you watched the same game I did today, you would know that our players were not ready for this game...at all. Talent...and a bit of luck...brought us to a 24 - 3 lead. Coaching brought us to the final result. Tennessee managed to erase the lead and a 10-year record all at the same time. You would have to go back to 2005 to find the last time Tennessee erased a 21-point deficit. We just became Tennessee's \"signature win\" under Butch Jones. We were the signature win for a Florida team led by Will Muschamp. We became the signature win for James Franklin and Vanderbilt. We have been the signature win and on the wrong side of the record books a number of times under Coach Richt. \nIt's over. Your excuses are over. It isn't the Strength and Conditioning coach. It isn't Mike Bobo. It isn't Willie Martinez. It isn't Todd Grantham. It isn't Jeremy Pruitt. \nIt's over. It was over a year ago September when our boys didn't show up to play against South Carolina. The issue wasn't Morgan missing a chip-shot field goal; the issue was why he was kicking the ball in the first place. It was over when we gave up 400-yards to the worst Florida team in 25 years. It was over when Richt called for a squib kick in a game we were winning. it was over when we barked on the sideline, invited 92,000 of our closest friends to a monsoon, and lost by 28 points to Bama. It was over when we became Tennessee's signature win. \nAfter Alabama last week, I wrote a Fanpost regarding your relationship with Richt. Here are the results: POLL How is your current relationship with Coach Richt. 27%You're my boy Blue! We've had some bad luck, but Richt will get us there. (21 votes) 31%I'm sticking with CMR as I'm not confident I will find someone better. I'm sticking with \"good\" though I doubt we will ever be \"great\". (24 votes) 26%It's not you, it's me. I thought you were the one, but barring a superb finish, time to look at other options. (20 votes) 16%It's definitely you Coach. I've seen enough. Let's move on. (12 votes) 77 votes total Granted, it is a small sample size, but what I take from it is obvious...we have a pretty equitable gap, four ways to sunrise, on how people view this program. My guess is that this has changed dramatically in the last few hours. If you still whole-hearteldy support Richt, I respect you, but the reason why is beyond me. For those of you that question our ability to do better, I will tell you that not all programs end up as Tennessee and Texas...and one of those programs just got their signature win against us. Fear is the worst of reasons not to act. Could things turn out badly for us? Absolutely? Could we end up firing the next coach in three-years? Absolutely. Could we lose Eason? Absolutely. Allow me to save you the drama now; Eason will not save us. Stafford did not save us. Knowhshon did not save us. Gurley did not save us. Chubb did not save us. Pruitt did not save us. Dawg fans, things may just get better. We may just turn the corner under a new regime. We may just win games we are supposed to win. We may just win games we aren't expected to win. We may just win the SEC again. We are a juggernaut of a program...we are affluent, we are the definition of potential, and we reside in an incredibly rich recruiting environment. We just lost to arguably the second-worst game manager in the SEC...Butch Jones. We lost to a coach who vomited on himself against Oklahoma, Florida, and Arkansas. The silver-lining? He may just stay a bit longer. Then there is our program...a team heavily favored to win the East in 2013, 2014, and 2015 is out of the hunt in Week 6. How does that sit with you? The hard truth is that Richt is a 2nd rate coach of a 1st rate program. His time is over. His underachieving is over. His blowout losses are over. He is over. Poll What beverage are you drinking tonight? Kool-Aid: I depend on Mark Richt like Mark Richt depends on me! Red Bull: Mark Richt gives me wings...though I'm prone to crashes one, two, or three times a year. Ipacec: Mark Richt causes me to vomit. I need a new coach to settle my stomach. vote", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:09:31.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
