For scores and live updates from across the area, go to stocktonpreps.com » Social News MANTECA — In the minds of Darrion Kitson and his teammates, the Manteca-Sierra high school football rivalry comes down to history and territory. Manteca High is the elder statesman in town, founded in 1920, while Sierra didn’t open until the first Clinton administration in 1994. “It’s like a back in the day, old school type of thing. Two teams who don’t like each other. We don’t like blue. They don’t like us,” said Kitson, a senior linebacker and fullback. “They just came into town trying to claim things, and we don’t like that. “Let them know we’re the big bros.” The two meet for the 21st time, as the Timberwolves entertain the Buffaloes in The Record’s Game of the Week at 7 p.m. Friday at Daniel Teicheira Memorial Stadium. Last Halloween, Manteca hosted Sierra and ended its unbeaten run with a 34-20 victory in the rain and slop. This time, the tables have turned, and the Timberwolves (3-2, 1-1 Valley Oak League) can ruin the Buffaloes’ (5-0, 2-0) charmed campaign. “I would be mad, too, if I was on their team,” Buffaloes senior Ronaldo Tijero said. Even those new to the rivalry, such as Sierra junior quarterback Mark Vicente, know what's at stake. “Get our revenge,” Vicente said, “with our home-field advantage.” Vicente came into his own last week, going 10-for-14 passing with two touchdowns and three rushing scores as Sierra blasted East Union 54-28. The Timberwolves could be hitting their stride, and proving skeptics wrong, at the perfect time. “Because all of our seniors left last year, everybody is counting us out,” Vicente said. While the Timberwolves are just now finding their offensive personality — though senior running back Mark Paule Jr. has been a constant, with 635 rushing yards and eight touchdowns — the Buffaloes’ defense has known theirs for months. Mean. Merciless. Exceptional. Manteca already has posted three shutouts and hasn’t allowed more than six points in a game. “Our defense is nasty, man. We’ve got a lot of play makers on this team,” the defensive back Tijero said, singling out Kitson and junior linebacker James Thomas. “They just want to take your head off.” Kitson couldn’t agree more. “We like to hit. That’s what we do. Smacking heads is fun to us, and it’s funny to us. In a safe way, we’ll do it,” he said. Manteca has won 14 of 20 all-time against Sierra, according to The Manteca Bulletin, including four of the last five. Buffaloes coach Eric Reis (started 2002) is 10-3 against the Timberwolves, and Sierra coach Jeff Harbison (started 2005) is 3-7. For Sierra and its sacks leader Andrew Guevara, a senior defensive lineman, today is about much more than revenge for last year. It’s a lingering war. Said Guevara: “Town pride.” — The Record’s Kevin Hecteman contributed to this story. East Union (3-2, 0-2 VOL) at Weston Ranch (3-2, 0-2 VOL), 7 p.m. The Valley Oak League has been unkind to the Lancers and Cougars. After unbeaten preseason runs, East Union and Weston Ranch have been outscored by a combined 125 points in their four games. The Cougars edged the Lancers last season on a late touchdown run from Bryant Bowen. Chavez (2-3) at Bear Creek (0-5), 7:15 p.m. The Bruins hope the beginning of San Joaquin Athletic Association play will mean a new chapter. Bear Creek’s defense, tops in the SJAA last season, has showed strong, but the offense has labored to produce. Chavez senior quarterback Keith Dosier, a lefty, has been on-point. Last time out, he went 12-of-15 passing with three touchdowns in a 53-7 shellacking of Vallejo. Edison (0-5) at Stagg (1-4), 7:15 p.m. A .200 winning percentage is not indicative of the preseason the Delta Kings had. After laying an egg in a 29-0 opening home loss to Lincoln, Stagg played admirably. The Delta Kings lost by a point to Modesto, scored 33 points against unbeaten NorCal power Pleasanton-Foothill, knocked off Lodi on the road and nearly beat Oakland Section power McClymonds. Edison, though, let a lead against Modesto Christian slip away last week and is winless on the year. Franklin (1-4) at McNair (4-1), 7:15 p.m. After beating Tokay, a Tri-City Athletic League member and a Sac-Joaquin Section playoff qualifier three years running, McNair surely enjoyed its bye week. The Eagles are powered by the incomparable senior duo of quarterback Osai Brown (1,799 passing yards, 24 TDs) and wide receiver Derrion Grim (1,144 receiving yards, 18 TDs). Franklin is fighting to make sure 2014 doesn’t repeat itself. The Yellowjackets opened the season with a win over Sacramento-Johnson, and didn’t taste victory again. Through the preseason, that pattern has matched. Lincoln (2-3) at Lodi (2-3) at the Grape Bowl, 7:15 p.m. When things got ugly for the Trojans against Merced, trailing 33-0 after three quarters last week, junior quarterback Aaron Thomas breathed some life into Spanos Stadium. Thomas had a 33-yard touchdown run, with two long TD passes. Trojans coach Brian Gray said he and senior Colby Dickson will see playing time, depending on the situation. Lodi has backed up preseason confidence in its defense, which has eight returners, holding opponents below 10 points twice already. Tokay (3-2) at Tracy (2-3), 7:15 p.m. After showing early promise, the Tigers and Bulldogs didn't have their desired nonleague finales. Last time out, Tokay lost its homecoming game by two touchdowns to McNair. In a playoff rematch, Turlock blanked Tracy 27-0 at Wayne Schneider Stadium. The Bulldogs are trying to get back to normalcy with sophomore quarterback Josh Alvarado, who turned 15 the day before the Turlock game, thus eligible for varsity play. West (4-1) at St. Mary’s (3-2), 7:15 p.m. If the Wolf Pack expect to upend the Rams, snapping an eight-game losing skid, they’ll need to lean on senior running back Marcel Dancy. Dancy is second in the section with 1,093 rushing yards and 16 touchdowns, with three receiving scores, and is surely the focal point of St. Mary’s defense. The Rams annihilated Atwater-Buhach Colony 38-3 in their homecoming game last Friday, holding an opponent to single digits for the first time since a shutout of Tokay last October. Bret Harte (2-3, 1-1 MLL) at Linden (1-4, 0-1 MLL), 7:30 p.m. It’s not the Lions’ Mother Lode League debut, yet the Lions have yet to score a Mother Lode League point. Amador hosted and handled Linden 21-0 last week. The Lions, amped up before the season about their plethora of returning players, have shown flashes of capable offense and defense, but have yet to string together success in all three phases in consecutive weeks. Hughson (5-0) at Escalon (3-2), 7:30 p.m. The Trans-Valley League isn’t a tea party. No, the TVL, filled with monsters like the unbeaten Huskies and the eight-time section champion Cougars, is a bloodbath waiting to happen. It begins in Escalon, where the Cougars’ 3-2 mark is a little deceptive. Escalon’s losses are to Grass Valley-Bear River, the defending section Division V champion, and a school twice its size in Patterson. Hughson has posted three shutouts this season: 34-0 (Modesto-Johansen), 44-0 (Waterford) and 38-0 (Galt-Liberty Ranch). SATURDAY’S GAME Millennium (1-4, 0-1 CCAA) at Brookside Christian (2-4, 1-0 CCAA), 7:30 p.m. at Lincoln The Knights have the leading tackler in the state, according to MaxPreps.com . Brookside Christian senior linebacker Sione Liku has recorded 116 total tackles this year. He had 26 alone, with an interception return for a touchdown, in last week’s 34-12 Central California Athletic Alliance win over Turlock Christian. Millennium has been up against it, and dropped its CCAA opener 69-0 to reigning section Division VII champion Merced-Stone Ridge Christian last Friday in Atwater. OUT-OF-AREA GAMES Kimball (1-4, 0-2 VOL) at Modesto-Central Catholic (5-0, 2-0 VOL), 7 p.m., Lathrop (3-2, 1-1 VOL) at Oakdale (5-0, 2-0 VOL), 7 p.m., Ripon (2-3) at Hilmar (3-2), 7:30 p.m., Ripon Christian (4-1, 1-1 SL) at Waterford (2-3, 0-2 SL), 7:30 p.m. — Contact reporter Thomas Lawrence at (209) 546-8272 or tlawrence@recordnet.com.
