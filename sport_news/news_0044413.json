I said, 'But Shiv you are playing all over the world competing on the European Tour and you must be on a plane a lot,\" added Fritsch.\nDAMAGING PROSPECTS\n\"In the end he probably spends more time waiting at airports, being in transit, in the aeroplane itself, than I do in the car. My body is lucky enough to be resilient and it really is fine for me.\"\nIt is clear Fritsch's decision not to fly is damaging his career prospects but he appears untroubled by the thought.\n\"I really enjoy the life I have, it goes along with the best advice I've received from veterans out here who say, 'Don't let the tour rule your life',\" he said.\n\"Personally I don't see why I have to say I MUST play in China for example, that I MUST play in South Africa. I don't say I MUST do those things...I'm not going to be a slave to this game.\"\nFritsch has had an up and down year this season, missing the cut six times but also chalking up four top-25 finishes including a tie for seventh at the European Masters in Switzerland in July.\nEven if he secures his card and qualifies for the lucrative Final Series, the German has no intention of traveling to China twice, Turkey and Dubai to compete in the four-tournament, end-of-season extravaganza.\n\"Why would you drive through all those trouble spots?\" he said. \"I cannot say I will never fly and maybe some time in the future I may look at the situation again.\n\"As far as I'm concerned, since I decided not to fly I think my career has been quite successful. I flew to Morocco at the beginning of last year and about five or six days before I started to get quite depressive.\n\"I don't really eat that much, I'm in a poor mood and on the day of the flight and then during the flight I feel as if someone is playing Russian Roulette with me,\" said Fritsch.\n\"I feel as if there's a gun barrel pointed at my head, I hear a click and I'm just waiting for it to go 'boom'. That's something I feel for hours, for days, and something that's just taking too much away from my quality of life.\"\n(Editing by Toby Davis )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:43:51.119+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
