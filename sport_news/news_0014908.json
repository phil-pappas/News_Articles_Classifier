(AP) - A federal agency is granting the state of Vermont's request that Entergy provide the state with additional details about reimbursements from the Vermont Yankee Decommissioning Trust Fund.\nA three-judge licensing board of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ordered Entergy on Thursday to provide the state with notice before making withdrawals the state has objected to, such as funds for property taxes and attorneys' fees that are not related to decommissioning the nuclear power plant.\nEntergy a year ago sought to remove the requirement it give the state 30 days' notice of its intent to withdraw funds, but later dropped that request.\nDepartment of Public Service Commissioner Christopher Recchia says the ruling will help the state ensure that the funds are used properly and that decommissioning can occur as soon as possible.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
