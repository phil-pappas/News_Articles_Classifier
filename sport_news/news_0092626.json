The seven-time All-Star was removed for a pinch hitter in the sixth. \nMolina missed the last part of the regular season due to a strained ligament in his thumb. He is 1 for 8 with two strikeouts in the series. \nThe Cubs also are missing a key player. Shortstop Addison Russell is out of the lineup after he left Game 3 with tightness in his left hamstring. \nChicago leads 2-1 in the best-of-series. \nTony Cruz got the start at catcher for the Cardinals on Tuesday, and Javier Baez is at shortstop for the Cubs. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:53:52.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
