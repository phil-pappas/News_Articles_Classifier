Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office A woman's body was discovered amid a suspicious fire in Strasburg over the weekend.\nNow, the blaze is being investigated as a homicide — and an arrest warrant has been issued for 58-year-old Andrew Ausmus,\nAs for the victim, she has yet to be positively identified owing to the damage to her remains.\nBut family members are strongly suggesting that she is Teresa Ausmus, Andrew's former wife (known to loved ones as Terry), as well as the person who reportedly filed multiple protection orders against him — including before and after their divorce last year.\nPhotos from the scene of the fire courtesy of 7News . 7News A Facebook post by one relative reads in part, \"He...murdered my little sister.\"\nAs detailed by the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office, the tragic story came to authorities' attention at around 1:10 a.m. on Saturday, October 17.\nThat's when a passerby called 911 after seeing active flames and smoke emanating from a residence at 4185 South County Road 157 — Teresa's home.\nFirefighters raced to the scene, and while battling the blaze, they discovered a body in the garage of the home.\nRelated Stories Call Her Fawn Wielichowski, Sister Says, Since Husband Nikolas Gianes Killed Her Isaiah Roquemore, R.I.P.: Family Mourns Amid Search for Suspect Najib Mahamoud 7News The victim was dragged outside — but unfortunately, she was already dead.\nEvidence collected at the scene led to the issuance of an arrest order for Andrew at 1 a.m. on Monday, October 19.\nRegarding his relationship with Teresa, a United Airlines worker employed at Denver International Airport, court records obtained by 7News contain damning assertions against Andrew.\nHe's said to have regularly consumed alcohol \"to the point of intoxication,\" as well as being both verbally and physically abusive. Andrew allegedly used profane language against her and would block hallways and doorways to restrict her movements.\n7News \"He is a large person and I fear for myself that I am in danger if he is allowed back at the house,\" one report Quote: d Terry as saying.\nRelatives speaking anonymously to 7News added that Andrew \"continually tormented\" Terry, who thought he might have been following her as recently as two weeks ago.\nThe Facebook post referred to by the station appears to have been removed. However, the following note is currently online on a relative's page:\nOn behalf of the Malone family, we appreciate all of the outpouring of love and support at this terribly tragic time. However, many have seen the news and have questions. So do we. We know nothing more than the news does. We really ask for everyone to respect our privacy at this time. When we know about services, we will pass all the info along. With all due respect we need time to gather ourselves. 7News Meanwhile, Andrew remains on the loose at this writing.\nThe ACSO describes him as a five-eleven, 230 pound white male with brown hair and hazel eyes; he may or may not still wear the sort of beard seen in the photograph circulated by the department.\nHe's considered to be dangerous, and members of the public are discouraged from contacting him directly. Instead, they're instructed to reach out to local law enforcement immediately.\nOur sincere condolences to the friends, family and loved ones of Terry Ausmus.\nHere's a larger look at the photo of Andrew circulated by the ACSO, followed by a 7News piece .\nAndrew Ausmus.
