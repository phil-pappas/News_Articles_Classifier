The development also has a name: The Battery.\nThe first restaurants are: Antico Pizza, Cru Food and Wine Bar, Tomahawk Taproom featuring Fox Bros. Bar-B-Q, chef Ford Fry’s Superica restaurant and a new steak concept by chef Linton Hopkins.\nSunTrust Park construction in May 2015. The construction is about to begin on the mixed-use side of the development, said Braves Chairman Terry McGuirk.\n“This place is about to become a bubbling cauldron of construction and building,” he said.\nThe restaurants are key to the Braves’ strategy of creating a 24-7, live, work and play environment around SunTrust Park not only during their 81 regular season games but on the days when the Braves aren’t playing.\nThe Braves previously announced a concert venue, Omni hotel and Comcast as the sole tenant of an office tower to be built on site.\nBut it’s the mix of retail and food that have been among the biggest unanswered questions of how the ball club and its development team would draw customers 365 days a year.\nRetail anchors weren’t announced Wednesday.\nJeff Fuqua and partner Heather Correa of Fuqua Development, the retail partners involved in the project, have targeted chef-driven restaurants, bars, high-end women’s apparel companies and a grocery store. In February, Fuqua said higher-end retailers on par with J. Crew, Anthropologie and lululemon were to be expected. Fuqua is aiming for flagship stores for new entrants and retailers that have few shops in metro Atlanta.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/14/db/05/SunTrust-Park-Construction-May-2015.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T09:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:19:21.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
