Platini is regarded as somewhere \"between a witness and an accused person\" in the payment case, the Attorney General has said.\nFIFA is due to hold an election on Feb. 26 to replace the outgoing Blatter. FIFA's election committee will decide on who will be accepted as full candidates shortly after the deadline for nominations on Oct. 26.\nThat deadline could pose problems for Platini if he remains under a provisional ban, as he may find it difficult to pass an integrity check.\nOn Friday, FIFA announced it would hold an extraordinary Executive Committee meeting on Oct. 20 after pressure from some UEFA associations including England's Football Association.\nA postponement of the election, which would help give Platini time for his appeal, is likely to be on the agenda.\nTwo sources with knowledge of the discussions, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters on Friday FIFA was considering delaying the election. A FIFA spokesperson said \"for the time being, the schedule is as it is.\"\nSouth American football confederation CONMEBOL criticized Platini's suspension and said he was the right man to lead FIFA.\n\"Mr Platini has not been found guilty of any accusation and his provisional suspension puts at risk the integrity of the electoral process for the presidency of FIFA,\" it said.\n(Writing and additional reporting by Simon Evans in Zurich and Brian Homewood in Berne; Editing by Helen Popper )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T20:45:58.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
