The San Jose State punter can stare down a batch of savory, hand-cut fries and request a salad instead. \nArmadillo Willy's is getting off easy with its employee. When Carrizosa entered college last year, he weighed 245 pounds. Chowing down the crispy fries on his breaks at the restaurant didn't help. \nYet, the 5-foot-10 player won the Spartans' starting job while averaging 36.8 yards a punt. When special teams coach Dan Ferrigno joined the staff this year, he suggested the Salinas punter could do better -- starting with a diet. \n\"He was too big for his height,\" Ferrigno said. \nIt's physics. Carrizosa couldn't get his leg up high enough to put his full body into punts. \nCarrizosa trained hard over the summer with San Jose State's linebackers, reduced the carbs intake, added more vegetables to the dinner plate and reported to fall camp a slim 218 pounds. \n\"Feel good, play good,\" Carrizosa said. \nCheck that. Play great. The sophomore is leading the country heading into Saturday's home game against New Mexico with a booming average of 50.2 yards per punt. Five of Carrizosa's punts have sailed 60 or more yards this season. One traveled 73 yards last month against Air Force in a punt that was 21 yards farther than his best the previous year. \nHis play has been one of the highlights for San Jose State (3-4, 2-2, Mountain West), which needs to win three of its final five games to become bowl eligible. Advertisement \nCarrizosa now likes to model his medium-size No. 17 jersey that fits him loosely. \nThe face off with Fast Food Nation began at the South Bay barbecue chain. Carrizosa said gobbling up those golden fries \"was killing me.\" \nThe incentive of improved punting, though, won over the lure of mouth-watering morsels. \n\"It was just being active every day,\" the Palma High alum said. \"I can't go a day without being active and trying to eat right.\" \nIt wasn't just dieting. Carrizosa re-dedicated himself to his craft after spring camp. He got help from his high school coach Doug Saucedo, a Palma math teacher. \n\"It was grind, grind, grind,\" Carrizosa said of going to summer school and training. \"It wasn't really painful. It was a motivating thing for the guys to do.\" \nCoach Ron Caragher could not be happier about the transformation. \n\"To Michael's credit, he did it,\" Caragher said. \"He has significantly improved his shape.\" Contact Elliott Almond at 408-920-5865.
