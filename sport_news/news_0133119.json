No. 14 Mississippi won 52-3. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis) It's been nearly a century since Memphis and Ole Miss first met on a football field, in Oxford on Oct. 1, 1921. The Rebels won that game, 82-0.\nOn Saturday morning, they will convene at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium for the latest installment of their rivalry. No. 13 Ole Miss will aim to win its seventh straight against the Tigers, who last beat the Rebels in 2004. Each team recognizes the challenges that the other will create.\n\"They can really run on both sides of the ball, special teams,\" Memphis coach Justin Fuente said of the Rebels. \"Their defensive line jumps off the film at you. And then their quarterback seems in control of what's going on and (is) doing a pretty darn good job of getting the ball to their various playmakers.\"\n\"I know the excitement level and enthusiasm they have around their program right now,\" Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze said of the Tigers. \"It is a quality football team. They are playing with great confidence. They have what a lot of us desire in a sound, good quarterback. He's one of the better ones I've seen on film.\"\nAs Saturday's game creeps closer, we're taking a look at how Memphis and Ole Miss stack up against one another in every facet of the game, including key matchups and players to watch.\nWhen the Tigers pass\nMemphis: The key here will be Paxton Lynch, Paxton Lynch and Paxton Lynch. In last year's meeting, he completed 41.9 percent of his passes and finished with a 5.1 quarterback rating. He's a different quarterback this season, but the Ole Miss defense will present similar challenges, specifically when it comes to rushing the passer. Lynch will need to make smart decisions under pressure, and take advantage of big-play opportunities when they arise. If he plays out of his mind, the Tigers will have a really good chance of winning this game. A poor performance, on the other hand, could doom them.\nOle Miss: The Rebels rank first in the SEC with nine interceptions, three of which they have returned for touchdowns. While there is not an All-American in the secondary with the skill set of Senquez Golson, last year's leader in the defensive backfield and a second-round pick of the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers, there is some experience. Preseason All-SEC selection Mike Hilton moved to nickel back last weekend and responded with three tackles for loss and an interception. Tiger QB Lynch may fare better than last year when he was limited to 81 passing yards and 13-of-31 passing, the worst output of his career.\nWhen the Tigers run\nMemphis: For Memphis' offense, the threat of running the ball is as valuable as actually running it. That's why the Tigers have run nearly as many times this season when they've been tied or trailing (115 carries) as they have when they've been in the lead (123 carries). And it's worked. Certainly the foursome of Sam Craft, Doroland Dorceus, Jarvis Cooper and Jamarius Henderson would like to run the ball a bit more effectively than it has through five games, but it has still been plenty good enough to fuel the misdirection in this offense.\nOle Miss: When he's not lining up in the offensive backfield, defensive tackle Robert Nkemdiche, at 6-4 and 296 pounds, has been an anchor, and a beast, on the defensive front. Nkemdiche, a preseason All-American, will be a challenge for an improved Memphis offensive line and double-teams may not be effective. Nkemdiche leads the Rebels with 5.5 tackles for loss and was the SEC's Defensive Player of the Week in the team's early season win at then-No. 2 Alabama, a performance that likely boosted his already glowing NFL Draft status.\nWhen the Rebels pass\nOle Miss: Transfer Chad Kelly, Hall of Famer Jim Kelly's nephew, has had a solid first half of the season. And he's been fortunate, too (see the touchdown catch off a defender's helmet at Alabama). But, most of all, he has stepped in and been consistent. In last weekend's lopsided win over winless New Mexico State, he completed 24 of 33 passes for a career-high 384 yards. He leads the SEC in passing yards (1,862), yards per completion (15.39), total offense (332.08) and touchdown passes (14). At midseason, he is already tied with Bo Wallace and Eli Manning for most games of 300-plus yards in a season (four). He has tossed nine of his touchdowns (with only two interceptions) in the Rebels' three nonconference games. And he has a trio of receivers — Laquon Treadwell, Cody Core and Quincy Adeboyejo — who are averaging between 14.6 and 20.2 yards per reception.\nMemphis: This is Memphis' biggest question mark entering the game, hands-down, without question. First and foremost, how will the Tigers put pressure on Kelly while simultaneously preventing big plays on the back end? How will they cover Treadwell and the Rebels' other explosive receivers? Who will cover Treadwell, specifically? Should Memphis force a few turnovers or take a significant step forward in pass coverage, it will have more than a fighting chance to win this game. But if the secondary struggles early, it could get out of hand fast.\nWhen the Rebels run\nOle Miss: The emphasis, before the season began, was for the Rebels to become more of a running threat, to get what players called \"the dirty yards.\" So far the results have been mixed, mostly due to losing All-America tackle Laremy Tunsil for the season's first half because of an NCAA violation. (Tunsil returns next week vs. Texas A&M.) The Rebels rank 13th in the SEC in rushing in their three conference games (104-yard average) and last (tied with Vanderbilt) at 2.9 yards per carry. In those nonconference blowouts over UT Martin, Fresno State and New Mexico state, the Rebels are averaging 273 yards per game. Memphis products Jaylen Walton and Jordan Wilkins, who have combined for nearly 500 yards and five touchdowns, may be motivated by making their Liberty Bowl stadium debuts.\nMemphis: For all of Memphis' defensive warts, it's been relatively stout against the run thus far, holding opponents to 131.6 yards per game on the ground. That ranks 37th in FBS. Another bright spot: The run defense has improved later in the game. Opposing running backs are averaging only 3.2 yards per carry in the second half (compared to 3.81 in the first) and only 2.17 yards per carry in the fourth quarter. Slowing down Ole Miss' rushing attack, and making the Rebels one-dimensional, would give the secondary a slight advantage.\nSpecial teams\nMemphis: It's hard to fairly compare or rank entire special teams units, but it's become clear in recent years that Memphis has one of the best special teams groups in the country. Most Power Five schools would love to have a kicker like Jake Elliott. The Tigers' punting tandem of Spencer Smith and Nick Jacobs, while unorthodox, has resulted in a net average of 42.21 yards, ninth-best in the FBS. And coverage on kickoffs and punts have been reliable. All told, Memphis will have a special teams advantage in most, if not all, games it plays this year — including this one.\nOle Miss: The Rebels have one of the better kicking teams in the SEC. They lead the league in net punting with a 42.3-yard average, while Will Gleeson, like Jacobs an Australia native, ranks fifth overall at 44.1. Memphis University School product Gary Wunderlich, ejected (in error) from last year's game, is 8-of-10 on field goals with a long of 45. A sophomore, he's never missed a field goal from between 30 and 49 yards. As far as their return game, it's not at the same level. The Rebels rank last in the SEC with a 6.1 average on 15 punt returns and 11th in the league in kickoff returns (18.2 average).\nMemphis vs. (13) Ole Miss\nWhen, where: 11 a.m. Saturday, Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium\nTV, radio: WATN Channel 24, WHBQ-AM 560, WREC-AM 600", "external_links": ["http://media.jrn.com/images/200*269/10792.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/392342.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/10792.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*111/269565.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*200/341771.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/341771.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*259/392342.jpg", "http://media.jrn.com/images/269565.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T01:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:32:42.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
