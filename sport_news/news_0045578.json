More >> \nThe Hawkeyes obviously have a lot of momentum right now but they're also starting to deal with some adversity. It sounds like at least 5 guys who started out this season on top of the depth chart will not be on the field Saturday at Northwestern. That includes defensive end Drew Ott, who's done for the season with an ACL tear. \nKirk Ferentz: We've got a lot of guys banged up right now. I'm not going to give you a count, but we have more than a couple. It's that time of year, so we'll find a way to get through this game then we'll go from there.\" Obviously you want to go through an entire season hopefully with no injuries on the entire team, but that's just not the way football is.\" \nQuarterback CJ Beathard appears to be one of the question marks -- after suffering what appeared to be a groin injury against Illinois -- and while nobody in the Hawkeye camp would offer any specifics as to the nature or extent of that injury -- Beathard believes he'll be ready to go -- \nCJ Beathard: \"Right now I'm positive I'll play.\" \none guy who's definitely playing is Jordan Canzeri -- who was likely a bit sore after Saturday's game where he recorded a Hawkeye record 43 rushing attempts -- \nand while his workload shouldn't be as high this week -- another missed game by LeShun Daniels means he'll once again be the horse in the Hawkeye backfield -- \nand if he has to carry 11 straight times like he did against Illinois -- he says he's up to the challenge \nCanzeri: \"I'm just willing to whatever to help the team and help us win. If it mean I have to do a drive like that, I'm willing to, and I'm always ready to.\" \nbut the Hawks likely hope they won't need him to as they head in to their first all-top 25 clash in 5 years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:07:44.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
