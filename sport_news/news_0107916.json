V8s tweak 2016 race formats \nShort – 60km – races will be removed from the V8 Supercars championship from next year, and organisers have also boosted the number of soft tyre races. \nIn tweaks to the format for next year’s championship, every race except the showpiece Bathurst 1000, the Phillip Island race and the non-championship round at the Australian Grand Prix, will feature soft tyres. \nEach garage will receive a boosted tyre allocation from 324 to 400 a car to deal with the changes. \nThe two Saturday 60km races at SuperSprint events will be replaced with a sole 120km race. \nChampion-in-waiting Mark Winterbottom said the changes would please both drivers and fans. \n“The soft tyre generates great racing and the challenge of trying to make it last as long as possible will be greater next year,” he said. \n“The single race format on Saturday at the SuperSprint events is also going to spice things up as, with a compulsory stop, it brings strategy back into the first day of racing.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:44:37.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
