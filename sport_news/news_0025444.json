But then they lost their star defensive player, stumbled heavily and fell 37-24 in yet another road upset, this one to the unranked Tigers at the Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium. \n“There’s something missing for sure,” Freeze said. “We’re obviously not locked in totally. We did not play particularly well. It was very disappointing the way we played. It’s crushing.” \nThe Rebels suffered their second upset on the road in three weeks, which includes a 38-10 loss to Florida on Oct. 3. They are 0-2 when trailing at halftime this season and 4-11 under Freeze. \nMemphis (6-0, 2-0 American Athletic Conference) rallied to overcome a 14-0 deficit with 9:44 remaining in the first quarter. The two-touchdown deficit was the largest the Tigers have faced this season. \nRebels star defensive lineman Robert Nkemdiche exited the game with a concussion following a rush attempt early in the second quarter, and the Tigers offense took off from there. \nA 23-yard field goal trimmed the Tigers’ deficit to 14-10 with 3:49 left in the first half, and two touchdowns over the final 2:52 of the first half gave them a 24-14 lead heading into halftime. \nThe Tigers extended the lead to 31-14 on a 31-yard touchdown pass with 11:31 left in the third quarter. The score ended a streak of 31 consecutive points scored by the Tigers. \nLynch finished 39 of 53 for 384 yards and three touchdowns against one interception. Anthony Miller led the Tigers with 10 catches for 132 yards and a touchdown. \n“I think there was a time in the first quarter when they thought, ‘Maybe coach hasn’t been lying to us forever and we can do this,’” Tigers coach Justin Fuente said. “We certainly aren’t perfect, and we started off rough again. Our kids fought and clawed and found a way to win the game.” \nThey survived a late rally to do so. \nRebels wide receiver Laquon Treadwell caught a touchdown with 6:59 remaining in the third quarter, trimming the deficit to 31-21. Gary Wunderlich added a 24-yard field goal to bring the margin to 31-24. \nHowever, the Rebels punted twice on their next two possessions, which lasted a combined seven plays and 31 yards, before Rebels quarterback Chad Kelly threw his second interception on their final drive. \nThe loss ruined several program-record performances on offense. \nKelly completed 33 of 47 passes for 372 yards and had two touchdowns against two interceptions. It was the fifth time he threw for at least 300 yards, breaking a tie with Eli Manning and Bo Wallace for most in a single season. \nTreadwell caught 14 passes for 144 yards and one touchdown and threw a 68-yard touchdown to Quincy Adeboyejo to open the scoring 20 seconds into the game. \nTreadwell’s 14 receptions were a school record, besting the previous mark of 13 by Barney Poole against Chattanooga in 1947 and Floyd Franks against Alabama in 1969. \nThe Rebels’ 440 passing yards also set a program record. \n“I’m hurt for the Ole Miss people,” Freeze said. “They deserve better today for sure.” \nKEY PLAYER \nPAXTON LYNCH, MEMPHIS \nThe Tigers quarterback completed 39 of 53 passes for 384 yards and three touchdowns, while only throwing one interception. \nKEY FIGURE \n31 \nMemphis scored 31 consecutive points from late in the first quarter until early in the third quarter, an offensive outburst that provided cushion for a late Ole Miss rally. \nContact Daniel Paulling at dpaulling@jackson.gannett.com.
