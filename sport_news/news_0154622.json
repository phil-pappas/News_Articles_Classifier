The Clippers went 0-3 in those first three games, then lost 37-8 to Marshfield in Week 4. It was Falmouth’s worst loss of the year, but Couhig played well enough to finally earn the starting spot. Fast forward a year. The Clippers are 3-0 -- their best start in five years -- and could improve to 4-0 when they open Atlantic Coast League play at home tonight against Nauset at Guv Fuller Field. Eleven of the Clippers’ 12 touchdowns this season have come from Couhig: Eight on the ground, three in the air. “He’s doing a great job,” Falmouth coach Derek Almeida said. “He really is. I have so much confidence in him. Even when things aren’t quite going well, I think he knows we’re going to figure it out.” Couhig has mastered Falmouth’s triple-option offense, a complicated system that relies on the quarterback’s decision-making abilities. Couhig said he didn’t play youth football growing up and played just his seventh-grade year in junior high, meaning he’s really just had two years to figure it all out. Now he can cycle through his reads without a moment’s hesitation. “A triple-option to the right, I read the defensive end, if he comes down I pull and then I attack the linebacker. If he attacks me, I pitch, and if he goes with the ‘A’ back, I just keep the ball,” Couhig said. “So basically every play I’m doing something. … The speed of the game from freshman year to last year, it was a huge jump. From the varsity level to the freshman level, it was very different, but once I figured that out, I just had to trust my reads, trust my instincts and play football.” Couhig is a three-sport athlete at Falmouth, starting on both the varsity basketball and baseball teams last year. Baseball came first -- “I’ve been throwing a baseball around since I was 2, ever since I could walk,” Couhig said -- but this past summer Couhig split his time between American Legion baseball and offseason football camps. Those camps, combined with diligent commitment to the team’s weight room program, have certainly paid off in these early weeks of the football season. Mastering a system is essential to any quarterback. But football also demands improvisation and adjustment on the fly, and Almeida said Couhig showed that with his three-touchdown game against Bishop Feehan last week. “He made a couple nice throws, and he made a nice play with his legs,” Almeida said, referring to Couhig’s 66-yard touchdown run in the second half. “But really, it was all the other plays where he executed the plays correctly.” Almeida added, “He’s a great athlete, number one, he likes to throw the ball downfield and he’s a great decision-maker.” Couhig was born in Gardner in central Massachusetts, but moved here when he was 2. He grew up in the Falmouth Public Schools system, up until this year frequently playing on the same teams as his older brother Mike. “We were on the same Babe Ruth (baseball) team, same high school teams, same Legion team, so I’m glad I got to do that with him,” Couhig said of his brother. This year, Couhig added, Mike has “made it to every single game besides the opener.” Mike and Nick last played together on the Sandwich Post 188 American Legion team, and the season before that played baseball for the Clippers. Both were captains, and Nick earned ACL All-Star honors as a pitcher. Mike is now at Curry College in Milton. Couhig said he’s already being recruited for baseball, including Division 1 schools like Boston College, Northeastern and Connecticut, and is interested in studying sports management or business. Almeida saw Couhig play during baseball season. The mechanics of throwing a baseball and football are different, but Almeida said he definitely saw the same leadership and competitive mentality he’s seen all football season. “You can tell that he’s in control when he’s on the pitcher’s mound, and I think there’s a lot of carry-over to that,” Almeida said. “He’s going to get a lot of (college) interest in football. I know he already has a lot of interest in baseball, but I think he’ll find that there are going to be some (football) people looking at him, too.” By Matt Goisman", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:31:21.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
