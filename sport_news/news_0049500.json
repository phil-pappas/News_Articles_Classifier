Who has the edge? Tim Fuller-USA TODAY Sports Cardinals first and foremost Cardinals first and foremost | Don’t commit more turnovers than the Lions. The Lions will have trouble scoring unless the Cardinals' offense contributes, as it did in last week’s loss to the Rams. The Cardinals' defense needs to do a better job of limiting the damage after a turnover, too. Rob Schumacher/azcentral sports Cardinals key stat Cardinals key stat | 405: That’s the Cardinals average yards gained per game. That ranks fourth in the NFL, behind the Patriots, Bengals and Chargers. David Kadlubowski/azcentral sports Cardinals key player Cardinals key player | Safety Tyrann Mathieu: He came close last week to intercepting two passes, and he caused a fumble that could have resulted in a victor had the Cardinals recovered. If he makes a similar play today, the Cardinals will win. Michael Chow/azcentral sports Lions first and foremost Lions first and foremost | Pressure Carson Palmer. If Palmer has time to throw, the Cardinals will score more than 30 points. If he doesn’t, the Lions have a chance. The Rams successfully created pressure last week with a three-man front and blitzing linebackers and safeties. Rob Schumacher/azcentral sports Lions key stat Lions key stat | 47: That’s the Lions’ average rushing yards per game this season, worst in the NFL. The Lions need to give quarterback Matthew Stafford some help. If they can’t run the ball efficiently, Stafford will have a long afternoon. Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY Sports Lions key player Lions key player | Running back Ameer Abdullah: The Cardinals hierarchy loved Abdullah coming out of the draft last spring, and it’s easy to see why. He’s elusive as a runner and is an excellent receiver. If Abdullah has a big day, it likely will mean a victory for the Lions. Troy Wayrynen-USA TODAY Sports Stat pack Stat pack | How Larry Fitzgerald compares to Calvin Johnson, based on career numbers. Fitzgerald - Experience: 12th year | Receptions: 939 | Yardage: 12,583 | Avg. yards per catch: 13.4 | 100-yard games: 40 | TDs: 94 Rob Schumacher/azcentral sports Stat pack Stat pack | How Larry Fitzgerald compares to Calvin Johnson, based on career numbers. Calvin Johnson - Experience: 9th | Receptions: 670 | Yardage: 10,660 | Avg. yards per catch: 15.9 | 100-yard games: 44 | TDs: 75 Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY Sports Cardinals on offense Cardinals on offense | This is the first game in which all the Cardinals regular starters will be available, including running back Andre Ellington. The most intriguing part of the Cardinals offense will be watching how Bruce Arians uses his running backs: Ellington, Chris Johnson and David Johnson. Rob Schumacher/azcentral sports Cardinals on offense Look for Chris Johnson to get more carries than the other two. With all three healthy, the Cardinals should be able to use Ellington judiciously, which might help him avoid more injuries. The Lions are physical up front, especially tackle Haloti Ngata, and they receive a boost this week with the return of DeAndre Levy. Rob Schumacher/azcentral sports Cardinals on offense The Cardinals need to do a better job in pass protection. Last week, the Rams gave them problems with blitzes and stunts, and the Cardinals at times seemed confused about whom to block. They say they’ve worked out those problems, but the Lions will test that. Rob Schumacher/azcentral sports Cardinals on offense One of the key matchups Sunday will be left tackle Jared Veldheer blocking defensive end Ziggy Ansah. Veldheer hasn’t played that well the past two weeks, and Ansah is an athletic pass rusher who has four sacks already. | Edge: Cardinals Troy Wayrynen-USA TODAY Sports Lions on offense Lions on offense | The Lions are terrible at running the ball, averaging 47 yards per game and 2.72 yards per rush. The Rams ran all over the Cardinals last week in the fourth quarter, which the Cardinals attributed to mental mistakes on a handful of plays. Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY Sports Lions on offense The Cardinals need to be respectful of the Lions running game, despite the statistics. Rookie back Ameer Abdullah is dangerous as a runner and a pass receiver. He’s not especially physical, but he has great moves and a knack for making defenders miss. Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY Sports Lions on offense The Cardinals likely will sell out to stop the run and would love for the game to come down to a matchup of Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford against a deep and talented secondary. Stafford should be wary of Tyrann Mathieu, who returned an interception for a touchdown two weeks ago and nearly picked off two more passes last week. Troy Wayrynen-USA TODAY Sports Lions on offense It will be interesting to see how the secondary matches up with receivers Calvin Johnson and Golden Tate. In past years, Patrick Peterson has defended Johnson, but Megatron is more of a possession receiver these days. Do the Cardinals switch Peterson over to Tate? Jake Roth-USA TODAY Sports Lions on offense The secondary needs more help than it’s getting from the front seven. That group didn’t put enough pressure on Rams quarterback Nick Foles. | Edge: Cardinals Michael Chow/azcentral sports Special teams Special teams | Both teams have rookie running backs returning kicks. The Lions’ Abdullah is averaging more than 30 yards a return, while the Cardinals’ David Johnson returned one 108 yards for a touchdown. He also lost a fumble on a kickoff last week. Michael Chow/azcentral sports Special teams Cardinals kicker Chandler Catanzaro made all five field-goal attempts last week, but to pick a nit, his kickoffs were shorter than usual. The Lions' Matt Prater has attempted only two field goals and made them both. With J.J. Nelson out with a shoulder injury, Peterson has been returning punts for the Cardinals. Brad Mills-USA TODAY Sports Special teams Peterson should be able to pop a long return soon. He needs his blockers to do a better job, but Peterson also has to follow his blocking. He tends to stray from it too early in returns. | Edge: Lions Rob Schumacher/azcentral sports Bottom line Bottom line | The Cardinals wanted Detroit to win last week. Not only would it have meant a loss for Seattle, an NFC West foe, it would have been the Lions’ first win. Winless, the Lions should be highly motivated. The Cardinals have the better team and they should be able to score enough to beat the Lions. Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY Sports Bottom line They had 22 points last week against the Rams despite three turnovers and scoring one touchdown in five red-zone situations. | Prediction: Cardinals 28, Lions 20 Rob Schumacher/azcentral sports Like this topic?

Follow Bob McManaman on Twitter @azbobbymac. Michael Chow/azcentral sports 32. (29) Tampa Bay Buccaneers: It’s too early to call Jameis Winston a bust, but hey, if the interception fits. Well, you know. Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 31. (31) Detroit Lions: I refuse to put the Lions last after they got screwed by an incompetent officiating crew that simply didn’t know the rules about batted balls in the end zone. Even Seattle coach Pete Carroll acknowledged the Seahawks caught a huge break since the refs made the wrong determination. Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 30. (28) Jacksonville Jaguars: So Jaguars kicker Jason Myers missed a 53-yarder with six seconds left against the Colts. Then he got a do-over because Chuck Pagano called timeout and the next one missed wide right, too. Oh, then he missed again it overtime, pushing one wide left. Brian Spurlock-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 29. (27) San Francisco 49ers: To paraphrase Clay Matthews of the Packers, “You guys are no good, bro!” Need I say more? I thought not. When do the Cardinals play these guys again, by the way? They could use a laugher after that rough loss to the Rams on Sunday. Oh, c’mon, I’m just playing. Cary Edmondson-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 28. (21) Miami Dolphins: Sorry, Joe. You had to go. The Dolphins made Joe Philbin the first head coaching casualty of the season and promoted their tight ends coach to replace him. Dan Campbell said he expects a tougher, more physical effort out of the players. We’ll see if they respond. Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 27. (32) Chicago Bears: Yeah, they won a game – barely – but for Bears tight end Martellus Bennett to compare quarterback Jay Cutler to Jesus, well, I’m at a loss for words. Google it if you want. All I know is the Bears are out of hell, err, Bobby Mac’s Power Rankings’ basement. Matt Marton-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 26. (26) Cleveland Browns: You’re 1-3. Don’t you think it’s time to see what Johnny Manziel can do for you as your fulltime starting quarterback? I do. So does all of Cleveland. Hello? Is this thing on? Hello? Jake Roth-USA TODAY Sports 25. (25) Tennessee Titans: Since they didn’t play in Week 4, they don’t gain or lose a spot. Good thing, too, because nobody cares outside of Nashville. Christopher Hanewinckel-USA TODAY Sports 24. (19) Kansas City Chiefs: Alex Smith has been sacked 19 times already. Let me sack the Chiefs five spots the week and we’ll call it even. Maybe you heartbreakers can beat the Bears this week. Aaron Doster-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 23. (17) Houston Texans: Wait a second. Bill O’Brien benched Ryan Mallett for ineffectiveness during Houston’s lopsided loss to the Falcons and turned to Brian Hoyer, who directed the Texans to three fourth-quarter touchdowns. Now O’Brien is going back to Mallett for Thursday’s game against the Colts? Oh, I give up. Jason Getz-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 22. (30) Washington Redskins: All I’ve got to say is, go Kirk Cousins. I’m not sure you guys can beat the Falcons on the road this week, but I wouldn’t put it past you. Man, did I really just say that? No wonder I had to make an appointment with the doctor this week. Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports 21. (16) Philadelphia Eagles: I don’t know about you, but I’m already tired of watching this team, reading about this team, and listening to all of their excuses. What say you? Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 20. (24) New Orleans Saints: Had to go to overtime to trip up the Cowboys, but they did it and Drew Brees showed his Hall of Fame credentials once again by connecting with C.J. Spiller on a dramatic, 80-yard touchdown play to win it. Will they beat the Eagles on the road this week? Check back for my picks. Derick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 19. (22) Baltimore Ravens: I told you they weren’t dead and they weren’t done. Well, not yet at least. Thank Steelers coach Mike Tomlin for that. This week the Ravens get the Browns. Smells like a Baltimore win to me, don’t you think? Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 18. (15) Dallas Cowboys: That’s two straight losses and counting after losing Tony Romo to that broken collarbone. I’ll say this, though: I’m not so sure I’d be in such a rush to replace Brandon Weeden with Matt Cassel. Weeden looked fairly decent despite losing to the Saints in overtime on Sunday night. Derick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports 17. (13) Minnesota Vikings: They’re 2-0 at home, 0-2 on the road. This week, they’re 0-0 because they don’t play. Good for them. Let’s move on before we start getting bored. Chris Humphreys-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 16. (14) Oakland Raiders: Wait, they lost to the Bears? Seriously? Makes me really regret wanting to pick them this week at home against the Broncos. But I’m doing it, because Denver has had to go to the wire every week to start out 4-0. I can’t believe I’m saying this, but “Go Raiders!” Jerry Lai-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 15. (9) Buffalo Bills: If I’m Rex Ryan, I’m not making the Bills watch tape from their 24-10 loss to the Giants. I’m making them watch tape of how officials call games. The Bills were flagged 17 times for 135 yards against New York. This, just one week after they were penalized 14 times for 140 yards against the Patriots. Timothy T. Ludwig-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 14. (23) St. Louis Rams: These guys make the biggest jump in my Power Rankings this week – nine spots – and it’s more than deserving. Look, they’ve beaten the Seahawks and the Cardinals and that’s saying something. With that attacking defense and the emergence of Todd Gurley, it might not just be a two-team race in NFC West. Matt Kartozian-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 13. (20) New York Giants: Admit it, you wrote off the Giants after their 0-2 start, didn’t you? Well, they’ve won two in a row and they’ll make it three in a row this Sunday night because they play the soulless 49ers on NBC’s Sunday night game of the week. Just sayin. Kevin Hoffman-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 12. (7). Pittsburgh Steelers: I blame coach Mike Tomlin for Monday night’s loss to the Ravens more than I blame kicker Josh Scobee, whom the Steelers cut after he missed two late field-goal attempts in the game. Mike Vick didn’t look too bad, but things will be dicey until Ben Roethlisberger gets back. Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 11. (18) San Diego Chargers: Hey, if you can throw for 358 yards and three touchdowns without three of your starters on the offensive line like Philip Rivers did in Week 4 against the Browns, you deserve a seven-spot promotion. Go ahead, tell me I’m wrong. Jake Roth-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 10. (11) Indianapolis Colts: OK, so it took a pair of oldies in Matt Hasselbeck, 40, and Adam Vinatieri, 42, to beat the Jaguars in overtime, but the oldies pulled it off. Andrew Luck should return from a sore right shoulder in time for Thursday night’s game against the Texans, who looked downright awful against the Falcons. Brian Spurlock-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 9. (12): New York Jets: Todd Bowles is off to a 3-1 start in his first real head-coaching gig and I’ve got to admit, he’s got this team on a collision course that should put a scare into the Patriots in the AFC East. They meet in another three weeks, so get ready. This week, the Jets are off. Steve Flynn-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 8. (10) Carolina Panthers: I’m telling you, this won’t last. It can’t. The Panthers have played a very weak schedule so far, having beaten the Jaguars, Saints, Texans and Buccaneers. Not impressed. They get the week off so I can’t move them down until they lose at Seattle in another week, which they will. Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 7. (8) Seattle Seahawks: They look like they're getting closer to being back on track, but let’s not forget how incredibly lucky they got Monday night because of some horrific officiating, especially at the end when the refs plainly got it wrong on that Calvin Johnson play. Troy Wayrynen-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 6. (6) Atlanta Falcons: When you can drop 48 points on the Texans’ defense, you’d think you’re making a statement. But here’s some news for you, sunshine. The Texans have allowed 108 points already, tied for the third-most in the AFC. That being said, the Falcons move to 5-0 this coming Sunday. Jason Getz-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 5. (3) Arizona Cardinals: No, they didn’t look all that great during a 24-22 loss at home to the Rams, but good teams bounce back and I’m confident the Cardinals will do just that this week at Detroit and next week at Pittsburgh. That’s why I only have them dropping two spots this week. Rob Schumacher/azcentral sports Fullscreen 4. (5) Denver Broncos: The Broncos sacked Teddy Bridgewater seven times and just a coincidence, but that’s also how many time Peyton Manning has helped his teams get off to 4-0 starts. Can Denver make it 5-0 this week on the road at Oakland? I’m honestly not sure … yet. Chris Humphreys-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 3. (4) Cincinnati Bengals: They’re 4-0, two wins from matching their best start in franchise history, and I will still contend the best is yet to come – in January when it actually means something. They get the Seahawks at home this week, so they’ll have to prove me right. I think they will. Aaron Doster-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 2. (2) New England Patriots: You should know the rules by now in Bobby Mac’s Power Rankings – if you don’t play, you typically don’t get moved from where I had you the week before. The Patriots get the Cowboys this week, so there could be some movement. But only if the team I still have ranked No.1 happens to lose at home. David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 1. (1) Green Bay Packers: It wasn’t always pretty, but neither are the winters in Green Bay. The Packers took care of business on the road against the 49ers and now they’ll have to do the same at home when they face a very good defense that rocked the Cardinals. Let’s see how Aaron Rodgers handles it, shall we? Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports Like this topic?
