Just this week they forbid one player from honoring a parent who died from cancer and fined another for doing so.\nPittsburgh Steelers defensive end Cameron Heyward was fined $5,787 by the league for violating the uniform code. What was his crime? He wrote “IRON” and “HEAD” on his eyeblack in tribute to his father , 11-year NFL veteran Craig “Ironhead” Heyward, who passed away from cancer in 2006.\nThe elder Heyward was diagnosed with malignant bone cancer at the base of his skull in 1998. Though he was pronounced cancer-free after surgery, the cancer returned and he died seven years later at 39.\nSteelers teammate DeAngelo Williams made the mistake of actually asking permission first and was summarily rejected.\nGot fined for honoring my Dad who bravely fought cancer on my eye black. #Nevergiveup #CancerSucks pic.twitter.com/RTx988ijG9 \n— Cam Heyward (@CamHeyward) October 14, 2015 \nWilliams’ mother, Sandra Hill, passed away from breast cancer in May 2014. As ESPN’s Lisa Salters reported during the “Monday Night Football” broadcast, Williams wanted to honor her by wearing pink shoes or wristbands all year, instead of just the breast cancer awareness month of October.\nHe was told by NFL VP of football operations Troy Vincent he couldn’t because the league doesn’t make exceptions to the uniform policy.\n“[I felt] the same way it made you feel after you heard it — like, man. He told me no. I’m assuming they are telling everybody else no as well,’’ Williams told ESPN. “It wasn’t about selling it. You know and I know and everybody else knows before I made the phone call.”\nWilliams was forced to audible, and dye the tips of his hair pink instead. He also committed to paying for 53 mammograms – his mother was 53 when she passed – at hospitals in Pittsburgh and Charlotte, where he played nine seasons with the Carolina Panthers before joining the Steelers.\nWhile the NFL has proven unyielding, the NBA has been far more compassionate in occasionally relaxing its uniform policy.\nLast season, a number of NBA players honored the memory of Eric Garner by wearing “I Can’t Breathe” T-shirts in pre-game warmups , including LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Nets stars Kevin Garnett and Deron Williams. The NBA didn’t fine them, a lesson in forbearance the NFL could learn from.\n  Filed under breast cancer ,  cancer ,  nfl ,  pittsburgh steelers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:04:41.350+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
