Kickers have long been a punchline in football, but they can make or break your title aspirations, as Patriots fans know all too well. This importance makes it all the more remarkable that kicker has been a position of unmatched consistency over the past two decades in New England thanks to Adam Vinatieri and Gostkowski.\nHis colleagues are dealing with the new 33-yard extra point rule, they’re missing at a rate of six percent through the first four weeks of the season. In Week Four, while the Patriots were on a bye, NFL kickers were a mere 57-of-71 on field goal attempts.\nGostkowski, of course, set an NFL record for most consecutive extra points in a career with 425 in Week 3 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, a mark that was overshadowed somewhat by Brady’s 400th career touchdown pass. He’s as dependable a field goal kicker as Vinatieri ever was with the Pats, which might just be his greatest accomplishment.\n“Steve has been tremendous,” New England offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels said, “and Adam before him was equally as accurate and made a ton of clutch kicks and we’ve always felt good that if we had to put it in their hands, if we have to do that to win the game, we know what we need to do offensively to give him an opportunity and we certainly trust him to go out there and make it.”\nHow many other coaches can say the same with their rotating door of candidates?\n“Obviously kicking is very mental and if you do struggle it is a little harder to go out there with confidence, but the good ones, if they miss they can bounce right back and make the next one,” Gostkowski told ESPN.com . “There are a lot of reasons why guys can miss—it isn’t always just black and white—but you just have to learn to move on from it. That’s just the approach I take. I’ve missed plenty of kicks before.”\nNot as many as his colleagues seem to be missing in 2015.\nWho they’re picking\nOur roundup of picks for Sunday’s Patriots-Cowboys game:\nESPN.com : All Pats.\nGreg Cote, Miami Herald : Patriots 28, Cowboys 24. “This probably would have been our Game of the Week if the ’Boys had Tony Romo and Dez Bryant for a fighting chance. But they don’t, and Bill Belichick’s Pats are 11-4 after byes, and Brandon Weeden won’t outscore Tom Brady. Drew Brees torched Dallas’ secondary last week. You think Brady won’t? But Cows get Greg Hardy back from suspension to try to bother Brady and should keep it respectably close.”\nPete Prisco, CBS Sports : Patriots 37, Cowboys 17. “The Cowboys have major injury issues. Without Tony Romo, they won’t be able to keep up with Tom Brady and the New England offense. The Patriots are off a bye, and they will play like it. New England wins big.”\nCBS Sports staff : Seven out eight pick the Pats against the spread, unanimous straight-up for New England.\nPeter Schrager, Foxsports.com : Patriots 35, Cowboys 17. “This one lost a bit of its luster with Tony Romo, Dez Bryant, and Lance Dunbar all out, but there’s some added interest with the return of Greg Hardy. Randy Gregory might go, too, and Sean Lee could be out there. The Patriots have had simply too much success, and too much time to prepare coming off a bye week, for me to have any real concerns about them, though.”\nSB Nation staff : All Pats.\nElliot Harrison, NFL.com : Patriots 38, Cowboys 21. “Oh man, is this going to fun ... Randy Gregory crashing the pocket, trying to get to Tom Brady. Rob Gronkowski vs. Dez Bryant: Who will have more touchdowns! OK, I see Tony Romo leading the Cowboys down the field on an epic two-minute drill, handing Bill Belichick and company their first loss! Oh, wait—none of that’s happening. Gregory, Bryant and Romo are all on the shelf. At one point, CBS had itself a game. (P.S. This matchup should’ve been the Kickoff Game, but that ship has sailed.) Brady will torch the Cowboys linebackers and safeties going to Gronk. The underneath stuff will be there all day. Dallas’ best bet is to run Joseph Randle and Run DMC 40 times. Keep the football away from Brady. (Stop ... You know what I meant.)”\nNFL.com staff : New England across the board.\nUSA Today staff : Everyone picks the Patriots.\nMike Florio, ProFootballTalk : Patriots 44, Cowboys 20. “It was supposed to be Tony Romo vs. Jimmy Garappolo. Instead, it’s Brandon Weeden vs. Tom Brady. They’re gonna need a bigger scoreboard.”\nMichael David Smith, ProFootballTalk : Patriots 38, Cowboys 14. “Brandon Weeden isn’t playing badly at all in relief of Tony Romo, but the Cowboys haven’t been able to win with him at quarterback. And they won’t win Sunday, with the best team in the NFL coming to town. This one could get ugly for Big D.”\nNeil Greenburg, The Washington Post : Winner: New England Patriots 64.7 percent; pick: Dallas Cowboys +8.5. “The Patriots are fresh off their bye week and have scored on 61.8 percent of their drives. The Cowboys are in the bottom 10 for points allowed per drive (2.14). However, the Cowboys will have Greg Hardy in the lineup, who returns after serving a four-game suspension. With 27 sacks in his last 32 regular season games, Hardy can help keep Tom Brady uncomfortable in the pocket.”\nIt says here : Patriots 35, Cowboys 27. The Cowboys may indeed get healthy and still prove a legitimate threat in the NFC, but this isn’t that week.\nBoston’s MVPs through the years\n Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was named the MVP of the 2015, 2003, and 2001 Super Bowls. He received the NFL MVP for the 2010 and 2007 regular seasons. In 2007, he led the New England Patriots to an undefeated regular season, in which he threw 50 touchdown passes. Barry Chin / The Boston Globe Boston Bruins goaltender Tim Thomas was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as MVP of the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, when the Bruins downed the Vancouver Canucks in seven games. Barry Chin / The Boston Globe David Ortiz won the 2013 World Series MVP during Boston’s title win over the St. Louis Cardinals. Ortiz went 11-for-16 (.688) with a 1.948 OPS, two home runs and six RBIs against the Cardinals. By comparison, the rest of the Red Sox hit .169 with a .484 OPS and two home runs in the series. Stan Grossfeld / The Boston Globe Red Sox second baseman Dustin Pedroia, one year after winning the Rookie of the Year Award, won the American League MVP in 2008 after hitting .326 and compiling an OPS of .869. He led the league in hits and runs scored, and topped it off with a Gold Glove. Bob DeChiara / USA Today Sports In a series that featured the infamous \"Wheelchair Game\", Paul Pierce emerged as the 2008 NBA Finals MVP. He played a solid all-around game against the Lakers, averaging 19.7 points, 5 rebounds, and 4.6 assists as the Celtics won in six games. Elsa Garrison / Getty Mike Lowell was the 2007 World Series MVP after the Red Sox breezed to a sweep of the Colorado Rockies for Boston's second title in four years. Lowell batted .400 and had an OPS of 1.300, along with a home run and four RBI. Stan Grossfeld / The Boston Globe Taylor Twellman, of the New England Revolution, won the Major League Soccer MVP in 2005. He was second in the league with six game-winning goals. Overall, he had 17 goals and seven assists. Twellman's prime was cut short due to concussions, and he retired in 2009. Robert E. Klein / the Boston Globe Manny Ramirez was just, well, Manny in the 2004 World Series, as he helped the Red Sox eliminate the \"1918\" chants and bring home Boston's first championship in 86 years. He won the MVP of the series as the Red Sox swept the Cardinals. Ramirez batted .412 and had a 1.088 OPS. Stan Grossfeld / The Boston Globe Branch was MVP of Super Bowl XXXIX, in the Patriots' 24-21 win over the Philadelphia Eagles. He had 11 catches for 133 yards. Many believe he was a strong contender for Super Bowl MVP the year before (Tom Brady won), when he had 10 catches and 143 yards vs. the Panthers. Matthew J. Lee / The Boston Globe In 1995, Red Sox slugger Mo Vaughn won the American League MVP by batting .300 and slugging .575. He hit 39 home runs and led the league with 126 RBI. Vaughn actually had a better year in 1996, as he had 44 home runs, 143 RBI, and an OPS of 1.003, but only finished fifth in the MVP voting. Joanne Rathe / The Boston Globe In 1986 -- his first full season as a starter for the Red Sox -- Roger Clemens put together one of the greatest seasons in baseball history and earned the American League MVP. He went 24-4, posted an ERA of 2.48, and struck out 238 batters in 254 innings. Barry Chin / The Boston Globe \"Larry Legend\" won three straight MVP awards, from 1984 to 1986, along with two NBA Finals MVP awards in 1984 and 1986. Bird was one of the most dominant players in the league during the stretch - averaging nearly a triple-double for all three years. In 1984, he averaged 28.7 points, 10.5 rebounds, and 6.6 assists. Frank O'Brien / The Boston Globe Cedric Maxwell won the NBA Finals MVP in 1981 as the Celtics beat the Rockets in six games. He averaged 17.7 points, 9.5 rebounds, and 2.8 assists in the series while shooting 58 percent from the field. Frank O'Brien / The Boston Globe Jim Rice won his lone MVP award in a remarkable 1978 season. He led the league in hits (213), triples (15), home runs (46), RBIs (139), slugging (.600), OPS (.970) and total bases. Rice, for a time, was considered one of the best hitters in the game and as a result was finally elected into the Hall of Fame in 2009. Boston Globe Archives Jo Jo White won the NBA Finals MVP in 1976 after averaging 21.7 points, 4.3 rebounds, 5.8 assists, and 1.5 steals. The Celtics defeated the Suns in six games, in a series that included one of the most epic playoff games in NBA history: a triple-overtime thriller that the Celtics won 128-126. The Boston Globe Archives Talk about starting your career off with a bang. In 1975, center fielder Fred Lynn won an MVP in his rookie year. He led the AL in slugging percentage, OPS, doubles and runs. He hit 21 home runs and drove in 105 runs. He also had an OPS+ of 161. Obviously, he also was Rookie of the Year, with a Gold Glove to boot. Boston Globe Archives The Bruins' most recent MVP actually goes all the way back to 1974 with Phil Esposito, although the Bruins have had goalies win the Vezina Trophy as the NHL's best goalie. He scored 68 goals and had 77 assists for 145 points with a +/- of 51. Esposito tied his career high in assists in 1969, when he won his first MVP. Boston Globe Archives John \"Hondo\" Havlicek was a prolific scorer who led the Celtics to a title in 1974 and was the Finals MVP, averaging 26.4 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 4.7 assists in a series win over the Milwaukee Bucks in seven games. Frank O'Brien / The Boston Globe Dave Cowens' hard-nosed style earned him the MVP award in 1973, averaging 20.5 points and 16.5 rebounds in a year when Boston lost the Eastern Conference Finals in seven games to the New York Knicks. It was Cowens' third year in the league. Photo courtesy of The Color Daily Bobby Orr won three straight MVPs from 1970 to 1972. In 1971, the famed Bruins defenseman led the league in assists and plus/minus all three years. Orr is also the only Bruin to win a Stanley Cup MVP, winning in both 1970 and 1972. Ray Lussier / AP Carl \"Yaz\" Yastrzemski won his lone MVP Award in 1967, posting a 1.040 OPS and leading the league with 44 home runs and 121 RBI. He topped it off with one of his seven Gold Gloves. Frank O'Brien / The Boston Globe Bill Russell's career is so impressive that the fact he won five regular season MVPs is almost secondary to his postseason success (11 titles). The NBA Finals MVP did not exist before 1969, but it's likely Russell would have won a bunch. Boston Globe Archives Right fielder Jackie Jensen won an MVP exactly one year before his career ended. In 1958, he won the award after hitting 35 home runs and driving 122 runs, which led the league. He had a career high .931 OPS. Photo courtesy of US Airlines News Bureau Boston Globe Archives Milt Schmidt, a former Bruins captain, won an MVP in 1951. In 62 games, he had 22 goals and 39 assists for 61 points. Photo courtesy of Black & White Daily Center Bill Cowley won MVPs for the Bruins in 1941 and 1943. In both years, he had 45 assists. In 1941, he netted 17 goals and two years later, he had 27. Boston Globe Archives Ted Williams won two MVPs, in 1946 and 1949. From 1941 to 1949, Williams led the league in OBP, slugging, and OPS. He hit 43 home runs and drove in 159 in 1949, both career highs. In 1946 and 1949, Williams scored 142 and 150 runs respectively and led the league in both years. Boston Globe Archives Jimmie Foxx won three MVPs in his career, two with the A’s and one with the Red Sox in 1938. He had a career high OPS of 1.166 and reached the 50-homer plateau for the second time in his career. He slugged .704 during the regular season which was not even a career high (.749 in 1932, his first MVP season). Boston Globe Archives Defenseman Eddie Shore won four MVPs in six years for the Bruins. He won his first at age 30 in 1933 and then won back-to-back awards in 1935 and 1936. He then tacked on one more in 1938 at age 35. Boston Globe Archives There was a time when a player could lead the league in home runs with 10. That time would be right around 1912, when Tris Speaker (center) won the MVP. Speaker led the league with 10 home runs and a .464 OBP in 153 games. He belted out 222 hits, drove in 90 runs, and also hit 53 doubles, which led the league.
