Trent Cannon would fix that. Breaking through Bowie State's defenders, the six-foot sophomore running back rocketed across the field and found the endzone on a 68-yard scorcher. His second 65-plus-yard rushing touchdown of the day catapulted the Trojans back into the lead late in the third quarter. But it wasn't meant to be. The Bulldogs struck in the closing seconds of regulation to steal the lead and edge the Trojans 22-19. Following the heartbreaker loss, VSU is 4-3 (2-2 conference) with three regular season games left to play. Despite the loss, Cannon enjoyed a career-high day with 185 yards on 12 carries and two rushing touchdowns, plus two catches for 32 yards with a 26-yard receiving TD. Cannon had his fifth straight game in which he rushed for over 140 yards. He hasn't dipped below 85 rushing in six of seven contests this season. The Bulldogs put up 299 yards through the air and 251 on the ground while the Trojans had 173 in passing in 209 in rushing. Cannon burst out of the gate to open the game with a 67-yard breakaway, putting the Trojans on the scoreboard first. The Bulldogs, inside the first five minutes of the matchup, responded with an eight-yard passing touchdown from Trevon Bennett to Jamal Chappell, capping off a nine-play, 55-yard drive. They wouldn't get the extra point as VSU's Darion Thomas blocked the kick, keeping the Trojans in the lead at 7-6. The Bulldogs, however, would strike again, forcing the Trojans to punt and then scoring off of a 60-yard punt return by Kerrick Pollock to take the lead, 13-7. The Trojans fought back with a five-play, 61-yard march that ended in Cannon taking a 26-yard pass from Tarian Ayres to the house to tie up the game at 13-13. The PAT kick, however, was no good, preventing from VSU taking a one-point lead. The Bulldogs jumped back out in front with a field goal by Christopher Palmer. The remaining eight-and-a-half minutes played out with no more scoring as BSU went into the halftime leading the Trojans 16-13. At the top of the third, BSU marched down the field into Trojans' territory on a 13-play, 63-yard drive, but the Bulldogs missed the field goal attempt. The Trojans came out swinging on their first drive of the half with Ayres slicing his way to the Bulldogs' 35 on a 39-yard run on the quarterback keep. But VSU found themselves in a 4th and long situation, and Ayres' nine-yard pass to Gene Holloman was not enough for the first down. On the ensuing drive, Ray Prosise rolled out a sack on Bennett for a loss of seven yards, but the Bulldogs pulled themselves out of a 2nd-and-deep situation with an 18-yard pass to Kendall Jefferson. VSU, however, would force the Bulldogs to punt. The back-and-forth third quarter nearly wound down to a scoreless close, but then came Cannon's second incendiary run TD of the day to swing the lead back over to the Trojans, 19-16. But spoiling the party was Pollock, who scored on a 12-yard pass from Nyem Washington to put the Bulldogs back on top for the final time in the contest. BSU quarterback Trevon Bennett went 26-of-41 for 274 yards, a touchdown and an interception by VSU's Thomas. He was sacked once. Nyem Washington was four-for-four on 25 yards and a TD. VSU quarterback Tarian Ayres went 14-of-25 for 173 yards, no touchdowns, no interceptions, and one fumble lost. Ayres added 56 yards rushing. VSU's Jaivon Smallwood had four catches for 66 yards; Gene Holloman had four for 50. Pollock led BSU in receiving with six catches for 115 yards and a touchdown. Chappell added 73 yards on nine receptions and a score. Jefferson was BSU's leading rusher for 71 yards on 13 carries. Geo Feggins was the Trojans' leading tackler (8.5) with six solos. Darion Thomas ran back the interception for 24 yards. Ray Prosise of Petersburg had a sack for a loss of seven. BSU's Marquise Anderson had 5.5 tackles (five solos). As the post-season draws closer, VSU will look to go 3-0 over the closing stretch with two games on the road against The Lincoln University (Lincoln, PA) on Saturday, Oct. 24, 1 p.m. and Chowan University on Halloween Saturday, Oct. 31 in Murfreesboro, N.C. at 3 p.m. VSU will close out the regular season at home when they host Virginia Union University on Senior Day in Ettrick on Saturday, Nov. 7, 2 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:52:42.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
