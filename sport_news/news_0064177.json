We enjoyed the rest of our weekend, but by Monday, we were preparing and game-planning for Cross Keys. We really wanted to stay focused and keep things going.”The win was Jones’ first at Osborne since leading the team to a 3-7 record during the last season of his original tenure with the team in 2009. While the victory was exciting for the Cardinals and their returning coach, it didn’t take long for Jones and his staff to set their sights on tonight’s opponent, Cross Keys, even though the Cardinals had a bye last week.“It’s always good to get a win going into your bye week,” Jones said. “To not have to think about what you could have done and what things went wrong that you need to fix, is helpful. We still need to improve and fine tune things at every position, but the time off helped us physically and mentally as we prepare for Cross Keys.“We still have guys fighting for positions, which is good even at this time of the year. It means they still want to play hard and battle to help this team.”Cross Keys is playing a limited five-game schedule for the second year in a row. The Indians are winless through four games with one touchdown and have given up more than 42 points in every game this season. Jones, however, doesn’t believe Cross Keys will throw in the towel tonight.“They’re a struggling program, but they play hard,” he said. “I think it’s their last game of the year, so they’re going to want to end the season on a strong note.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:53:07.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
