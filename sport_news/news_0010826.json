I was playing with very high intensity, especially on serve,\" Djokovic said in a courtside interview.\nLike Djokovic, Tsonga has a fondness for the courts in Shanghai and will be hopeful of repeating his Saturday form when he takes on the Serb.\n\"This surface is one of my favorites. I know I'm able to play good tennis. Before I came here, I didn't know if I will be able to play that good. I hope it's going to continue,\" he said.\nThe Frenchman fired down 11 aces to record his first win over Nadal since the 2011 ATP World Tour Finals and move up to ninth in his bid to qualify again for the eight man end-of-season championships in London.\nNadal, a winner of 14 grand slam singles titles, struggled to cope with Tsonga in the opening set as the Frenchman pressured the Spaniard's serve with some heavy hitting.\nHe secured the break in the fifth game at the third time of asking but after going on to serve out the set, Tsonga's game crumbled in the second set as Nadal easily leveled without dropping a game to force a decider.\nNadal, looking for a first hard court title in almost two years, was forced to save some early break points but the third set remained on serve until Tsonga struck in the 11th game of an enthralling encounter.\nThe 30-year-old Frenchman produced an eye-catching dive volley to force match point, which he converted to reach his first Masters final since he triumphed in Toronto last year.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:59:37.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
