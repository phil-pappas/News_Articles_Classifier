Nevin spent the last two years as manager at Triple-A Reno in the Arizona system. \nDurham won six division titles and two International League crowns in Montoyo’s eight years. The Bulls also won the Triple-A championship in 2009. \nMontoyo was picked in 2010 and 2013 as the International League’s manager of the year. \nbob.dutton@thenewstribune.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:17:44.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
