Mikkel Boedker had the hat-trick while Brad Richardson scored the winner as the Coyotes picked up their first regulation win in Ottawa since Dec. 12, 1998.\nCoach Dave Cameron isn’t happy with the club’s work ethic.\n“It’s our compete. It’s simple as that. You can’t have any habits if you don’t compete,” said Cameron. “I wish I could (explain the carryover from one home game to the next). I wish I had an answer to that.”\nThe Senators have also been hit hard by injuries and they’re mounting.\nAlready without injured winger Mike Hoffman, who is day-to-day with a lower body injury, the Senators learned later defenceman Marc Methot would miss his third straight with a concussion. He had been cleared to play but wasn’t in the warm-up and his spot was taken by Chris Wideman.\nThe hits kept on coming when winger Curtis Lazar, who has played in virtually every role up front for the club in the early-going, left the game after the first period with an upper body injury. He was hit from behind on a crosscheck by Zbynek Michalek and didn’t return for the start of the second.\nThere was no call on the play but Lazar was slammed into the boards pretty hard.\nWhile Boedker put it away into an empty net, he scored at 15:49 to give his club a two-goal lead. The last time the Senators lost four-straight at home to start the season was the 2006-07 campaign. They went on to make the Stanley Cup final that spring.\nThe Senators are a frustrated lot.\n“It’s tough. We had a ton of chances, myself included, but I don’t think we were ready off the puck drop, we were in our own zone for 40 seconds and you get behind the eight-ball when you’re chasing five minutes in,” winger Bobby Ryan, who had eight shots but only picked up an assist.\n“In this league, you can’t give them away anytime. I don’t have an answer for it and I can’t figure out why it is but I’m sure we’ll have a lengthy conversation about it this week. (Not winning at home) wears on you, taking aside the fact people pay their money and want to see wins and not 4-1 losses, you can’t stay in the hunt losing points at home especially in a long homestand you don’t get anything out of it.”\nArizona put this one away with 5:29 to go in the third after Ottawa wasn’t able to get the puck out of their own zone. Richardson fired home a loose puck sitting at the side of the net beating Anderson on the stick side to silence the building after the Senators had pressed hard to score.\nAfter a so-so effort in the first period, the Senators picked it up in the second but it took everything they had to finally beat Lindback when Ceci scored his first of the season at 18:11 of the second which tied it up 1-1 going into the third after Ottawa had completely outplayed Arizona in the second.\n“It’s really frustrating,” said Ceci, who broke a 35-game drought that dated back to Feb. 15 last season. “That was a pretty terrible end to a good hockey game. It was close throughout the whole game. We had a lot of chances on the power play and the puck just wasn’t finding its way in the net.\n“They got the late one, we got deflated and gave up another right away ... we can’t get deflated like that because then we’re just running all over the place and giving up lots of chances.”\nTrailing 1-0 after the first, the Senators and Coyotes both had eight shots.\nBoedker broke the scoreless tie with 1:38 left in the first with what can only be described as a great individual effort, when he took a pass, skated right by Ottawa captain Erik Karlsson and put it upstairs on Anderson.\nIt’s the fifth time in eight games the Senators have allowed the first goal.\n“Losing is not fun. Hopefully, we’re learning from some of our mistakes,” said Anderson, who made 22 stops. “We can’t worry about home, away, we just have to go out and play our game regardless of what the venue is.”\nThe Senators close out this homestand Wednesday against the Calgary Flames.\nTHREE STARS\n1. Mikkel Boedker\nThe Coyotes winger was a one man wrecking crew with three goals. He entered the game with one.\n2. Anders Lindback\nMaking his first start of the season, he made 35 saves, including 17 of 18 in the second period.\n3. Bobby Ryan\nLed the Senators with eight shots on net and assisted on the team's lone goal.\nTwitter: @ sungarrioch\nGarrioch\nOttawa Senators suffer late-game meltdown, fall 4-1 to Coyotes\nBy Bruce Garrioch , Ottawa Sun First posted: Saturday, October 24, 2015 09:57 PM EDT | Updated: Saturday, October 24, 2015 10:33 PM EDT\nHome sweet home has left a sour taste in the Senators' mouths.\nThe Senators left the rink in stunned Saturday night as they dropped their fourth-straight at home to start the season with a ugly third period meltdown in a 4-1 loss to the Arizona Coyotes in front of 17,270.\nAlso in this article Ottawa Senators vs. Arizona Coyotes, Oct. 24 About the author Bruce Garrioch Bruce Garrioch's Blog Follow Bruce Garrioch on Twitter Other Stories Can Senators' Andrew Hammond return to miracle play?\nThe Hamburglar will return to the scene of some his greatest crimes.\n0\nSens coach Dave Cameron not about to panic about lack of production\nOn election day, Dave Cameron elected not to change his lines.\n0\nSee more from Bruce Garrioch »\n Hockey Lightning centre Steven Stamkos' future up in the air 0\nOilers Pakarinen gets his look 0\nOttawa Senators suffer late-game meltdown, fall 4-1 to Coyotes ", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://twitter.com/sungarrioch", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://twitter.com/@sungarrioch", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://blogs.canoe.ca/offtheposts"], "published": "2015-10-25T08:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:31:42.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
