Since the 1990s, our tastes have been educated and our desire (need?) for delicious coffee has driven the marketplace to respond and seriously surpass our expectations.\nWhen Ina's Kitchen opened in 1991, we had to import coffee from Seattle since the commercial brands available to us here were no match for our food. It was costly and inconvenient but our customers noticed and that was incentive enough for us to continue. It was only when Intelligentsia Coffee & Tea arrived on the scene (the company is celebrating its 20th anniversary this month) did we happily change to, and stick with, our new supplier.\nCoffee shops are now in every neighborhood and boast fair trade or organic or roasted-in-house or all of the above. We are so lucky to have Bow Truss, Dark Matter, Metropolis, Big Shoulders, Sparrow and so many more. Some have their own stores, some are served in other places, but all are extremely delicious and deliver on the promise that it will taste as good as it smells.\nI decided to try a few of these neighborhood coffee shops, provided they had some savory options at breakfast. I'll keep going and report on more later.\nTwo Hearted Queen\nFor a warm and exuberant greeting, this new, bright, beautifully decorated corner spot is a real find. Cely Garcia and Cassandra Andrewson have taken everything they learned at other shops and created the perfect space.\nWhile there is some seating in the main room where the magic happens, I love the back room, up one step, were you can have a meeting at a round table, or sit in a corner and work or just think.\nThey just got a panini press so how about a vegetarian version with spinach, tomato, onion and avocado, or a bacon, egg and cheese to go with the delicious coffee.\nDuring my visit, Garcia was just leaving to go to roast their beans at a friend's shop, Groundswell, which I will visit soon.\nOf note: They want to create community and have evening events. Street parking.\nFind it: 1201 W. Roscoe St., 773-360-8189, www.facebook.com/TwoHeartedQueen\nHours: 6 a.m. - 9 p.m. daily\nIpsento Coffee\nWho can resist a smiling staff that makes you feel like they've been waiting all day for you to show up? Not me, for sure.\nThe enchanting owner, Tim Taylor, came over because someone told him to introduce himself to me, which is kind and exactly what an owner should do. He insisted that I try their signature drink, which I declined at first, but then realized how wrong that was! He brought me The Ipsento, which is espresso with coconut milk, honey and a dash of cayenne. It's addicting, just like going to Ipsento.\nI was in a literary mood so I had a tough time deciding whether to order the Jane Austen, a croissant with cream cheese, apple and honey, or the Ernest Hemingway which has cream cheese, smoked salmon, capers and an egg on a croissant, but finally settled on the Emily Dickinson which begins with a naan and has hummus, tomato, cucumber, onion and spinach.\nOh, one more thing. I wanted to buy some coffee for home and Taylor asked about my tastes, what time of the day I'd be drinking it and recommended one that was perfect. Nice move, Tim!\nOf note: It's tiny with very little seating up front. The back room, up two or three steps, is cozy.\nFind it: 2035 N. Western Ave., 773-904-8177, ipsento.com\nHours: 6 a.m. – 8 p.m. Monday – Friday, 7 a.m. – 8 p.m. Saturday and Sunday\nEva's Cafe\nIn the middle of a block, and easy to miss, this charming spot is a real find.\nWhen you open the door, you step right into the front room, which is like a relative's living room with upholstered chairs, a sofa and small tables. Walk to the back, where you get a warm greeting and where you order, and you'll find more seating there.\nCoffee shops also serve tea and which means I look for a pot of tea and not a cup with a tea bag. They delivered on that for my friend Dan Rosenthal, the man behind Trattoria No. 10, the Sopraffinna Market Caffes and Poag Mahone's. He and I have very definite tastes and high standards.\nBesides the sweets, they offer sandwiches at breakfast which suits me fine. We shared a toasted focaccia with turkey, cheddar cheese, tomato, lettuce, basil with mayo and mustard. That's breakfast, right?\nIt's a lovely place to visit since the music is low and the setting peaceful.\nOf note: Street parking can be a problem. A working fireplace.\nFind it: 1447 N Sedgwick St.. between Schiller and Blackhawk, 312-280-8900\nHours: 7 a.m.-8 p.m. Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-8 p.m. Saturday-Sunday\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Entertainment Dining and Drinking", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562e24a7/turbine/ct-breakfast-with-ina-food-1028-20151026", "http://www.facebook.com/TwoHeartedQueen"], "published": "2015-10-26T14:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:33:35.462+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
