They had exulted earlier on July 30 when Yakub Memon, a plotter for the ’93 Mumbai attacks, was hanged. The celebration of capital punishment obscures the colossal intelligence failure that allowed such a large body of conspirators to plan seven blasts, all within an interval of 10 minutes, on packed commuter trains. It also obfuscates the escape of 16 key conspirators except for Kamal Ansari and the inability to hound them into surrender when given evidence of their relocation to countries considered India-friendly. The Mumbai train blasts followed a sickeningly familiar pattern. The scheming began when India-Pakistan ties were on an upswing. There was even talk of the then Prime Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, travelling to Islamabad. The foreign secretaries were to firm up the dates of his visit, both sides had released each other's prisoners and were set to give an impetus to the India-Pakistan-Iran gas pipeline. The blasts achieved their purpose. In the storm that followed in TV studios, all diplomatic exchanges were cancelled, any idea of Manmohan Singh crossing the Wagah border was buried and Iran's isolation remained on course. As was the case with Yakub Memon, a majority of those convicted were foot soldiers. The Indian state was unable to lay its hands on the men it had spiritedly accused of being the blast masterminds such as Raheel Shaikh and Rizwan Daware. There is no hope of ever getting closer to the mystery of why this kind of mayhem has unerringly occurred on the eve of all India-Pakistan talks that may achieve a breakthrough. The Mumbai attacks of 2008 and several other instances of mindless violence have been part of this pattern. The redemption ought to be publicly celebrated when such designs are strategically defeated. Till then let the moment of vindication be a private affair for the families who lost their loved ones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:04:26.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
