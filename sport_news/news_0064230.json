The tournament will take place from October 12 to 18. AFP PHOTO / JOHANNES EISELE Andy Murray says his top priority was being \"fit and healthy\" for the Davis Cup decider as he weighs up playing the World Tour Finals which finish just a few days prior. Murray has been warned about his obligation to play the tour finale in London but is worried about his troublesome back. \"You know, I have to do what's best for me. If everything goes well and my back feels good training on the clay beforehand, then I'll be there at the O2,\" Murray said, referring to the London tournament. Britain, seeking their first Davis Cup title in 79 years, will play Belgium on clay in late November.\nAdChoices AFP\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:54:25.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
