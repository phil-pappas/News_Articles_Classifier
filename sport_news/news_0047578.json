They're helping us monitor the situation because it is a conference game. If anything were to change, we'll let you know, but our plans as of right now are to go to Columbia and play on Saturday.\"\nSouth Carolina coach Steve Spurrier on Sunday said he didn't think the weather would much affect his team's preparation during the week.\n\"I don't think so,\" Spurrier said. \"Preparation-wise, we've gotta block and tackle. All those things are more important than maybe some gimmick plays right now. The execution of our plays is not very good, but we need to do more also.\n\"We need to do more. I need to try to help our offense more. There's no question about that. So I'll hopefully try to add something. We need a spark somehow. When we've got guys open, the ball's gotta be thrown at 'em. We sort of got away from that (Saturday).\"\nLSU's originally scheduled season opener Sept. 5 against McNeese State was cancelled after weather forced four hours of delays after one possession by each team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:30:47.170+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
