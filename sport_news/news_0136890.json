If coach Paul Haynes' words after the latest loss to BG doesn't convince you -- \"Give Bowling Green credit, they've got talent,\" -- then the combined 86-7 score from those two games should. \nStanding 3-5, 2-2 KSU is still tied for second in the MAC East with Ohio and with a lot of football to be played. \nThe question is what to fix. The obvious answer is the offense, although the defense has done its fair share of imploding as well. Against the Rockets (7-0, 4-0) and Falcons (6-2, 4-0), KSU's defense aided both with ill-timed penalties. \nWith four games to go, Kent has already given up 700 yards worth of penalties. \n\"It's a sign of maturity,'' Haynes said. \"We've got to get better at it.\" \nHaynes also noted that the high-octane teams they are playing are an issue as well. \n\"Against teams that spread you out and are athletic, we've struggled,'' Haynes said. \nTo the untrained eye, the offensive line for the Golden Flashes just has not developed as expected, although Haynes begs to differ. \"It's more than the offensive line,'' he said. \nStill, there appears to be several young skill talents to build around, including quarterback George Bollas, receivers Antwan Dixon, P.J. Simmons and Johnny Woods, plus tailbacks Raekwon James and Myles Washington, who are all freshmen. \nThere is also veteran experience at tailback, receiver and quarterback to keep the youth on point. This group should only get better. \nThe offensive line has its share of experience. But where this unit seems to expose itself is on the option play. Simply put, old school option football is power football designed for talented backs to turn upfield. Against good teams, that does not happen for the Golden Flashes. \nKent gained 166 yards of offense and went scoreless against a BG defense that was allowing a whopping 455 yards and 32 points a game. Kent gained 257 yards against a much tougher Toledo defense. KSU's offense was scoreless in both games, two of the four games in which the offense has failed to deliver a TD. \nThe remaining schedule is not as daunting, but Kent has yet to prove it can score effectively and consistently. The Golden Flashes, who have 12 days to prep for their next game vs. Buffalo, will be measured by how much the offense improves down the stretch, just as much as wins and losses. \n\"When we can do what we want to do (offensively), we've had a chance to win,'' Haynes said. \nKent has to start doing that more often.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T22:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:39:43.187+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
