Oregon's weekly honors went to...\nPlayers of the game:\nSpecial teams: Kicker Matt Wogan\nDefense: Lineman Alex Balducci\nOffense: Receiver (and moonlighting QB) Bralon Addison\nScout-team players of the week:\nSpecial teams: Safety Paris Bostick\nDefense: Running back J.J. Jones\nOffense: Defensive back Michael Manns\nHere are Helfrich's comments:\nWhat was the mood like today and what did the win mean for you guys?\nI think it's confidence in some areas. It's also we need to get a lot better in a ton of areas, and so the nature of the discussions, the conversations of the corrections is a little bit different after a win than a loss and making sure you've got everybody dialed in, which we did, and our coaches did a great job of refocusing those guys last week. And now it's a different type of focus, you have a very captive audience right now with our guys. So many things in the game: We tackled better but we still missed tackles. We aligned better but we still had a couple of alignment things. We should have blocked a punt for a touchdown and we should have had a punt blocked for a touchdown. So again, a thousand things after a win or a loss. As long we're in this together and we're in fix-it mode we've got a chance.\nDid you see progress from the defense?\nDefinitely. There's definitely progress. I think we improved in every phase which is encouraging but there's still a lot of meat on the bone in every phase, which is again, glass half-full, glass half-empty type of situation. We did a nice job in four-man pressure as the night went in on in creating a ton of pressure. Making them as one-dimensional as possible was big. We made a few plays in the secondary, we missed a few plays in the secondary, but I think coming out of that we'll do nothing but improve.\nHow do you balance running the ball and using that strength without being predictable?\nThat's always the million-dollar question. If you can run the ball you can set anything up. When I say you can do anything, you have the ability to do anything. You can get in certain coverages, you can dial people into certain looks but that's all predicated on being able to run the ball.\nWhat have you seen from Taylor Alie that merited that playing time at quarterback?\nTaylor had a fantastic camp. There were a lot of people, let's just say, he had a lot of people in his camp as far as supporters of where he fell on the depth chart and those guys have both done a great job of being competitive through this. Through not winning the job so to speak, battling through that is a hurdle and as you go through the season and into the grind of the season and maybe not playing exactly the percentage of reps that you want to, that's another mental hurdle and they've both managed that really well. Taylor is a playmaking guy and again had a couple plays in there that I know he'll just shake his head and slap himself on the side of the face and one guys had a primary read wide open for a touchdown and missed it. Had a couple very obvious overthrows but that's stuff he'll learn from and come back ready to go.\nWith two or three quarterbacks in the mix, do you change how you divvy up practice repetitions?\nMaybe. It's the greatest answer of all time, I think. It depends on, and again at that or any position, guys are going to be at various percentages of availability throughout the week. 'This guy is whatever percent, this guy is whatever percent' and then that will dictate reps from there.\nAfter watching how the rotation worked, would you be comfortable doing it again?\nI would be comfortable doing it if it makes sense. The game plan last week dictated that and there were some things that I thought both guys would do better than the other guys if that makes sense. They're both capable of executing the whole thing but they played well enough and execute to their deal at a high enough level to warrant that. We're not done game planning for Washington State yet so that, we'll see.\nYou mentioned the different strengths of the quarterbacks. Is Alie more comfortable or a better running threat than Lockie?\nYou could say that. ... A little bit more. We ran some of that stuff with Jeff, too, it was very effective. I think Taylor has a little bit different comfort level with a few packages that aren't really easily identified by the naked eye as you guys watch it. But it's not a, 'this guy is Michael Vick and the other guy is Ben Roethlisberger.'\nIs there something driving how you're managing quarterbacks in game? Is it something in the week or something in the moment?\nHopefully the offense is driving and scoring touchdowns. It's just again how the game plan is dictated and how the game plan is made which is dictated by a million factors. Their strengths and weaknesses, our strengths and weaknesses that week. What we think is the best way to attack them and how to parcel out the reps from there. Once you're in the game, that's where we had a definite play of how we were going to start it off and from there it's gut to a certain extent. The hard part is when you score with one guy and have a plan to go to the other guy of sticking with that plan. You made that plan with no pressure and all the best input theoretically and so you stick with that and after you get past whatever it is — some people do quarters, some people do dives, some do a number of plays — whatever that is once you get past then it's game time.\nMark Helfrich on Oregon's quarterback shuffle against Colorado The UO coach spoke after a 41-24 road win at Colorado, UO's first over a Power Five opponent this season and first in conference play.\nAnd they seem to be responding positively and comfortably with that?\nThey were great, yeah, they were great.\nWhat do you plan for having a quarterback succession plan year to year, or maybe the better question is is the term quarterback succession plan an oxymoron?\nWe'd love to recruit guys and have them be great players and stay here for five years and redshirt but it's just not realistic. From whatever inputs these guys get today, that as soon as somebody else is on campus, the other guy has to transfer. ... so guys on our team can transfer, which is ridiculous. At a lot of positions, specifically at quarterback where it's unfortunately a specialist mentality, but yeah, across the country there are transfers playing everywhere, there are graduate transfers playing everywhere. You obviously have to be great at that position and there's various ways to make that happen.\nWill Darren Carrington face any team discipline for his alcohol citation ?\nThat will all be handled internally.\nHe's eligible to be back for Washington State, correct?\nIf there is any change of that we'll talk about that after this game.\nBut by the NCAA suspension he's eligible to be back this week, right?\nIf there is a change of that we'll talk about that then. It's really the best thing to do. There are other parts to it.\nCould he face a one-game suspension from you or is that...\nUnrelated.\nBehind Royce Freeman there's a different guy who emerges. Is is you feeling out who's the hot hand that week?\nAgain it depends. Kani (Benoit) has done a great job both running, protection and all the facets of a complete tailback. Taj (Griffin) we had a little plan in there to get him on the perimeter and do some things that way. He's still developing the protections, and all that stuff, which he's getting better at. As you continue to have all those guys develop it's who's the most confident, who's the healthiest, who's the 'whatever' by week.\nDucks players react to quarterback rotation, road win at Colorado Taylor Alie, Taj Griffin, Rodney Hardrick and Jeff Lockie spoke after the 41-24 victory on Oct. 3.\nWas improving defensive pressure with four-man rushes a priority this offseason and what is the risk of blitzing against Washington State?\nObviously if you can create pressure with three guys you can be more multiple and a lot different in coverage and the same can be said for a four-man rush. Anything after that there's a ton of adjustment and is all those things that is certainly what has made Mike Leach very successful at what he does and why they do what they do. You have to vary things enough, you have to be standard enough in your own mind so you can play fast and free and you're not constantly thinking about formation adjustment or coverage adjustment. And then you have to make the quarterback uncomfortable. Whether that's hitting him, pressuring him, confusing him, creating turnovers, all the things you have to do to get in their head.\nKicker Aidan Schneider has made 12 straight field goals, does his consistency change how you manage going for it on fourth down?\nThanks for ruining the no-hitter for bringing that up. We have a ton of confidence in him and he's done a nice job as well as that whole (special teams unit). We have a ton of confidence in him and the range would just be dictated by climate more than any.\nDo you have a limit on touches a guy like Royce Freeman gets per game considering the depth you have?\nIt's everything. You can go in with a limit and Royce is a guy that delivers and takes punishment and that all adds up. If he bounces four runs and runs out of bounds and doesn't get hit that one might not count. There's not necessarily a pitch-count type of mentality, it's more of who's fresh, who's confident and who's ready to go and who can do some things later in the game you need to be able to do, whether it's protections or executing certain things where we'd need (Freeman) more or somebody with a little bit more experience to do.\nWhat is your criteria for when you decide to play which quarterback in a rotation?\nIn this game and in our situation right now we have just ... it wasn't even packages, it was a commitment to certain elements of our game plan. We didn't have a 'Jeff Plan' and a 'Taylor Plan.' I've been places where you absolutely do that. Now we had this list of plays and that's it. This list of plays and that's it. I've seen other people where guys shuttle in every single play. That's different than what we did. It'll really just be dictated on the game plan moving forward and how they practice and if one guy is measurably better than the other we'll look at that, too.\nDon Pellum coached from the sideline yesterday rather than the press box, and players reacted positively to it. Does it help you as a head coach to have him down there?\nYou probably said it best right there. If the players think it's the best that's the best. Hopefully that shows up in their play. Just trying to get a situation where Erik Chinander can be the eyes and DP can get everybody together and look them in the eyes, the full group together if need be, which they did a nice job yesterday of making some adjustments. It's a one-voice deal.\n-- Andrew Greif\nagreif@oregonian.com\n@andrewgreif", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/andrewgreif"], "published": "2015-10-05T02:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:30:03.431+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
