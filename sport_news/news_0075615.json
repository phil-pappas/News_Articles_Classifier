The next day one was seen in Crawford County in southwestern Wisconsin. On Tuesday lone snowies were reported in Kohler and Milwaukee.\nAnd on Cat Island in Green Bay earlier this week, six snowies were seen at once, Erdman said.\nLast year, the first snowy was reported in Wisconsin on Nov. 1. In 2013, the initial observation was Nov. 15.\nIn recent decades, the first snowies have typically appeared in Wisconsin in mid-November, Brady said.\n\"This year is completely taking people by surprise,\" Brady said.\nSo far this fall, snowy owls have been reported in the western Great Lakes region, but none in the eastern U.S.\nSnowy owls are about two feet tall and weigh from 2 to 6 pounds, the largest owl by weight in North America.\nSporting white plumage — with dark bars in female and younger birds — and luminous yellow eyes, the species has captured the fancy of humans long before Harry Potter books and movies came on the scene.\nScientists have closely documented the species' movements into the U.S. since the 1800s. The data have shown relatively large southerly flights called \"irruptions\" about once every four or five years, Erdman said.\nThe movements typically take place during years of high availability of lemmings — the primary prey of snowy owls in the Arctic — and high productivity of snowy owls.\nOnce fledged, the young owls disperse to areas with less competition for food.\nBut through history such years of high owl production occurred only periodically. The irruptions are now becoming \"commonplace,\" Erdman said.\nWisconsin experienced snowy owl irruptions in 2011-'12, 2013-'14 and 2014-'15.\nModern data collection techniques are helping scientists determine the number of snowies that venture into Wisconsin each year.\nBrady said 290 \"unique\" snowies were recorded in the state in 2013-'14. Last winter, also a significant flight, saw 280 snowies in Wisconsin.\nAlthough it's still early, Erdman said it looks like this will be the third irruption in a row and fourth in five years.\n\"There have been years when we had 30 birds in the whole state over an entire winter,\" Erdman said. \"We've already had 30 birds this year in October. And we've never had three in a row. Something is going on.\"\nErdman's hunch is related to climate change. He said a warmer Arctic could be increasing the habitat and abundance of lemmings, allowing snowy owls to produce more offspring more often.\nIn years of low prey availability, snowy owls won't nest at all. If it's a really good year, a pair of adults may fledge 10 young owls.\nSince very few researchers work in the expansive Arctic, it's difficult to get an accurate picture of lemming numbers and owl production, said David Brinker, a scientist with Project SNOWstorm and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.\n\"We are learning more each year, but there are still more questions than answers,\" Brinker said. \"But when we get an irruption, the opportunity to study birds is right in front of us.\"\nProject SNOWstorm placed transmitters on 34 snowy owls in the U.S. in the last two years. The devices allow scientists to track the birds and learn which habitats are preferred by snowy owls on their southern ranges as well as where they return in summer.\nBrinker said the Project SNOWstorm team met a week ago in Cape May, New Jersey to discuss plans for the season. They have loads of data to process and reports to write, he said.\n\"These owls create an extraordinary level of excitement among the public and scientists,\" Brinker said. \"The early reports from Wisconsin are causing us to re-evaluate our plans.\"\nStudies have shown snowy owls prey mostly on voles and other rodents in Wisconsin, as well as some birds.\nAmong the first orders of business for scientists in Wisconsin is to determine the ages of snowies being observed. Brady said young-of-the-year or subadult birds comprise most owls in an irruption.\nAlso, Brady said it was important to for the public to give plenty of space to any snowy owl they see. The birds are likely exhausted and hungry after a long migration, he said, and it's important to not stress the owls.\nIt's often difficult to tell the difference between an owl that is healthy and resting from one that is sick or injured. If in doubt, stay a good distance away and call a local DNR wildlife biologist for advice, Brady said.\nOnlookers in Kohler did just that earlier this week after they saw a snowy sitting on the hood of a vehicle in a Kohler Corp. parking lot. When a DNR employee arrived, the owl flew away.\nIt was one of the first of what promises to be many snowy owls seen in the Badger State this year.\nThe reasons behind the frequent irruptions may not be known for years. And they could well have ominous implications for wildlife in the Arctic and beyond.\nBut for the present, when it comes to the appearance of white objects in Wisconsin in fall, there's none more welcome than a snowy owl.\n ", "external_links": ["http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/JSI/RWS/jsonline.com/CAI/335411881/E/prod/PC/Basic/AT/A"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:08:30.624+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
