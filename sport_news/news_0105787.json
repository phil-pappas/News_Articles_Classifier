Maryland defeated Richmond by score of 50 to 21 at Capital One Field at Byrd Stadium. (Kenneth K. Lam / Baltimore Sun) Daniel Gallen Contact Reporter Terps DE Roman Braglio (mono) cleared, QB Daxx Garman (shoulder) gametime decision for Penn State. \nDefensive end Roman Braglio, who missed Maryland’s last game against Ohio State with mono, has been cleared for Saturday’s matchup with Penn State, interim coach Mike Locksley said. \nLocksley did not elaborate on how much Braglio would be expected to play. \nBraglio’s return boosts a front seven that’s expected to be tested by Penn State running back Saquon Barkley , along with a pass rush that will need to get pressure on Nittany Lions quarterback Christian Hackenberg to be successful. \nBraglio (McDonogh) appeared in the first five games of the season with four starts. He has 19 tackles, 4 1/2 tackles for loss, two sacks, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. \nLocksley also said backup quarterback Daxx Garman will be a gametime decision. The team was waiting for results from an MRI on his shoulder before making a decision. Maryland moved Shane Cockerille from fullback to quarterback to provide extra depth behind starter Perry Hills.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:40:07.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
