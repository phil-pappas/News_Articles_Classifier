The 6-year-old was diagnosed with Type I juvenile diabetes in April and would greatly benefit from the services of a diabetic alert dog. \nThe only catch? Said canines run around $25,000, an understandably steep price for a single mother like Charity Hembree to cover all on her own. \nMore than 175 donations on a GoFundMe page for Lucas have produced nearly $21,000 in not even four months, leaving the Hembrees well within grasp of their goal. \nA successful basketball clinic might just be the trick to put them over the top. \nThe Paws for a Cause will be Saturday from 9 a.m.-3 p.m. The event is open to boys and girls in kindergarten through the eighth grades and costs $40, which includes instruction, a T-shirt, lunch and potential prizes. \nThough clinic directors Josh, Jared and Jay Hembree are Vinemont guys through and through, the camp will actually be held at Cullman High. That’s no slap in the face to the Eagles, but rather a result of the family’s connection to Bobby Meyer. \nMeyer was an assistant at Vinemont during Josh’s high school days and head coached Jared and Jay before eventually taking his current post with the Bearcats. \nHolly Pond girls coach Scott Adams, Cullman County Schools assistant superintendent Brandon Payne, former West Point standout Steven Sutter and several others have also committed to helping out with Saturday’s festivities. \n“Lucas is just an incredible little guy. He’s got an incredible mind, an incredible heart. He’s been so brave,” said Josh, who’ll make his way home for the clinic from Rome, Georgia, where he’s a varsity girls basketball coach. “We just want to be there to support him, and this basketbal clinic is a way we can do that. I think we were raised as a family to try to take whatever circumstances we’re presented with and turn those into something positive.” \nOne of the positives that’s surfaced from an otherwise adverse situation is an uptick in the time the Hembrees have been able to spend together. Saturday’s clinic will serve as a basketball reunion of sorts for the brothers, who’ve sort of spread out since graduating from Vinemont in 1999 (Josh), 2003 (Jared) and 2006 (Jay). \nJared, of course, still holds the Cullman County Schools boys record for career points (2,252) and was a member of Meyer’s 2003 squad that finished as the Class 3A state runner-up. \n“I’m excited to work with my two brothers again,” Josh said. “It’s been a long time since all three of us have been in the gym together. Just looking forward to a great morning and a great afternoon. Hopefully we can be a blessing to a lot of people.” \nOne attendee sure to receive the bulk of the blessings is Lucas himself. Josh said the youngster will not only participate in the clinic, but will pipe in with a speech at some point. \nDon’t expect anything dramatic, though. That’s just not Lucas’ style. \nEven with the onset of diabetes and his eventual diagnosis affecting his every day activities, Lucas, a Vinemont kindergartener, has remained in his usual high spirits. \nThe one thing that’s made him upset? Missing basketball camp this year, which he’d been counting down the days to since attending his first in 2014 at Darlington School where Josh teaches and coaches. \nBroken-hearted by the fact he couldn’t go to camp again, the idea was hatched to bring the camp to Lucas. \nHe can’t wait. \nThe clinic will be a nice change of pace for a kid whose life has changed drastically since February. It was about that time Lucas’ family noticed he was constantly thirsty, always running to the bathroom and couldn’t get enough to eat — though he was still somehow losing weight. \nA simple stick of the finger on April 21 revealed the culprit as juvenile diabetes. Like that, normalcy for the then-5-year-old included pricking his finger upwards of eight to 12 times a day to test his blood sugar and receiving insulin shots every time he eats, which is at least six or seven times daily. \nThis won’t go away as Lucas ages, either, a harsh realization for his mother. Charity, however, has no doubt her little boy will continue to persevere. \n“This has been a complete life-changing experience for us,” she said. “After all he’s been through, he truly is my superhero.” \nTo register for the clinic, send an email to pawsforlucas@gmail.com with your child’s name, age, grade, school and T-shirt size. \nTo view Lucas’ GoFundMe page, visit www.gofundme.com/Lucas-alert-dog . \n% Rob Ketcham can be reached at 256-734-2131, ext. 138 or at robk@cullmantimes.com.​  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:20:47.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
