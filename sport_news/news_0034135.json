Let’s go,’” Smith said. “Malcolm [Jenkins] was like, ‘This is what you’ve been working for. This is what you’ve been doing all week. So, let’s show it on the field.’ \n“It was just stuff like that, just the positive mindset that we have.” \nIt had been a long time coming for the outside linebacker, and to a lesser extent, for wide receiver Josh Huff. They were the Eagles’ first- and third-round draft picks, respectively, in 2014. And for the most part, neither had shown much into their second season, much to the consternation of the fan base. \nSmith played a career-high 22 snaps in the Eagles’ 39-17 win over the New Orleans Saints on Sunday, backing up starters Connor Barwin and Brandon Graham. He played just 68 snaps as a rookie – mostly at inside linebacker, where he was forced to move after injuries decimated the position. \nSmith had one tackle Sunday, matching his total from last season. More importantly, he got in the face of Saints quarterback Drew Brees as he threw a pass, which was intercepted by Walter Thurmond in the fourth quarter. \n“My thought was, I have to get to the quarterback,” Smith said. “I beat [Saints offensive lineman Andrus] Peat and got around him ... I think I disrupted the way [Brees] threw the ball to the receiver and Walt picked it off. It was just a great feeling.” \nHuff had a similar reaction after finishing with four receptions for 78 yards and his first NFL touchdown. He had just four receptions for 39 yards in the previous four games. Huff showed his jubilation on his 41-yard TD, when he caught the ball about 10 yards down the field, then turned the corner as two Saints defenders collided, and finished the play with a somersault into the end zone. \n“I haven’t done that since high school,” Huff said. “I thought it would be fun.” \nEagles coach Chip Kelly wasn’t as pleased, although he said he didn’t mind the somersault. \n“He’s not going to run into the end zone with one hand on the football again,” Kelly said. “We have talked about that.” \nThe problem for Huff has been health. He hurt his shoulder during the preseason in 2014 and missed the first four games. He finished with just eight receptions for 98 yards. This season, Huff was expected to have a much bigger role in the offense with the departure of Jeremy Maclin and a full training camp under his belt. \nBut Huff injured his hamstring in practice the day before the Sept. 27 game against the Jets and sat out. He returned the next week against Washington after missing the first two days of practice. But he played just four snaps and expressed his displeasure. Kelly said the playing time was based on Huff missing most of the week of practice. \nHuff played a season-high 41 snaps against New Orleans, although some of that might have been a result of an ankle injury that kept Nelson Agholor out for the second half. But Kelly said that Huff “is an extremely dynamic player,” which he showed when he opened the game with a 40-yard kick return. \n“He’s really good with the football in his hands,” Kelly said. “That’s why he’s doing a great job of returning for us … I think Josh can do it all.” \nIt’s not as clear if Kelly feels the same way about Smith. He was active only because inside linebackers Mychal Kendricks (hamstring) and Kiko Alonso (knee) were out. When one or both have been healthy, Smith has been inactive. Kelly said fellow linebackers Brad Jones and Bryan Braman are more valuable on special teams. \n“Overall, I think he’s shown improvement,” Kelly said. “So, we were pleased first time getting him out there. We thought he did a good job.” \n“I definitely felt like I belonged,” Smith said. “I just pray and hope that I can continue to keep progressing. And I pray and hope that they find more confidence in me.” \nWing tips \nThe Eagles signed offensive lineman Tanner Hawkinson off the 49ers practice squad and released offensive lineman Julian Vandervelde for the third time this season. Hawkinson, 6-foot-5, 298 pounds, was a fifth-round pick of the Cincinnati Bengals in 2013 and got into four games for them the past two seasons. The 49ers signed him before the season. \nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com .
