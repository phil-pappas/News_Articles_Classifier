LOUIS (KMOV.com) - A $2,000 reward is being offered for anyone who information that leads to an arrest of the person or people behind fires that have been set at several predominantly black churches in the St. Louis area.\nSix such churches in North St. Louis City and County were set on fire in just a matter of days, and it is now prompting St. Louis pastors to rally behind those affected.\n“This is a travesty in our community and our city,\" said Rev. Earl Nance Jr., pastor of the Greater Mount Carmel Baptist Church. “When this kind of thing happens to one or more of our churches we must all come together.”\nAlthough his church was not affected by the recent fires, Nance said the pattern has reached a point where someone needs to step in.\nDozens of St. Louis pastors with Better Family Life have offered to help the affected churches wherever needed, from moral support to financial assistance.\n“There was once a time nobody touched the church. It was respected. Nobody had an idea of doing anything harmful to the church, but now it slipped. Now it’s anything, anyone, anywhere, any institution, it doesn't matter,” said Nance.\nNance told News 4 he has no hard feelings toward the person or persons who may be trying to stop their worship by setting the fires. In fact, he’d like to talk to them.\n“Stop his evil practice. And if you need help or need someone to talk to, contact one of us and let us talk to you,\" said Nance. “You can’t stop us from serving God, you can’t stop the church, and you can’t stop the message the church in trying to bring.”\nInvestigators are still looking into the details of each fire to determine whether or not they are connected. If you have any information, please call police.\nCopyright 2015 KMOV (Meredith Corporation).
