Garrison Stadium. \nThe Warriors (5-0, 2-0) have won all of their games with a lead of 35 points or more and the clock running at the end, but it took a while for LR Christian to get things going. \nThe Warriors scored 4 touchdowns while holding the Goblins (2-3, 1-1) to 12 yards and 1 first down in the third quarter to turn a 23-14 halftime lead into a rout. \nThe Goblins opened the scoring on a 3-yard run by Kanon Kirkland, but Little Rock Christian countered on its first play when Sanders completed a 64-yard touchdown pass to Joe Hampton. \nSanders and Hampton teamed up for a 32-yard scoring play to make it 14-7 with 2:20 left in the first quarter. \nTailback Damarea Crockett's 2-yard run two minutes into the second quarter made it 20-7. \nThe score was 20-14 in the second quarter when Harrison intercepted a Sanders passed and drove to the Little Rock Christian 3 on 14 consecutive running plays. \nBut Harrison threw two incomplete passes to give the Warriors possession with 1:08 left, and they got in position for a 25-yard field goal by Josh Best just before half. \n\"That was the first field goal we have attempted all year,\" Little Rock Christian Coach Jeff Weaver said. \"Best did a great job of knocking it through after we had gone 90 yards in just over a minute. When we are doing our jobs right, we are hard to stop.\" \nThe Warriors outgained the Goblins 200-12 in the third quarter, scoring four touchdowns. \nSanders completed a 41-yard touchdown pass to Austin Guymon on the fifth play of the second half and Crockett had a 19-yard touchdown run. \nCrockett scored his third touchdown on an 11-yard scoring pass from Sanders midway through the quarter and Sanders added a 25-yard scoring pass to Guymon that made it 51-14 with 3:39 left, enough for the mercy rule to take effect. \nAn 11-yard touchdown run by Trevor Ward with 8:20 left to play upped the Warriors' run to 38-0 and gave them a 58-14 advantage. \nSports on 10/03/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T10:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T05:35:57.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
