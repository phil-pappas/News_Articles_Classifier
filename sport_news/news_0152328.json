With almost all of their returning scorers back and a recruiting class ranked in the Top 25 by most major services, Florida State begins practices this week in what could be an important year for Leonard Hamilton and the programAP Photo/Nick Lisi, File) TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida State is the only team in the Atlantic Coast Conference that returns all five of its starters from last season.\nAdChoices For most teams that would be cause for celebration. For coach Leonard Hamilton it means he is hoping the struggles of the past two seasons have been valuable experience.\nThe Seminoles had their first practice on Wednesday as they are looking to bounce back from a season in which they went 17-16 and didn't play in a postseason tournament for the first time in 10 years.\n''We have five starters returning from a team that won 17 games. We have guys that have been around, who know their shortcomings and can pass on their wisdom to the younger players,'' Hamilton said.\nWith an experienced roster and a highly regarded recruiting class, Hamilton is hoping to lead the Seminoles back to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2012, which is also the year they won the ACC Tournament.\nJarquez Smith, the leading returning scorer from last season, said the open gyms before the start of practice have been extremely competitive as the incoming recruiting class has tried to assert itself early.\n''We've been going at each other's neck and it has gotten very competitive,'' Smith said. ''Everyone is fighting for their position because the guys coming off the bench are just as athletic as who is on the court.''\nThe newcomers feature Dwayne Bacon (a McDonald's All-American selection), Terance Mann (the Gatorade Player of the Year in New Hampshire) and Malik Beasley (the Georgia 1A Player of the Year). There's also Chris Koumadje, who at 7-foot-4 will be the tallest player in school history, and Benji Bell, who helped lead Northwest Florida State to the JUCO National Title.\n''This is a very confident and focused group of inexperienced players,'' Hamilton said. ''They want to make something special happen but aren't taking anything for granted.''\nTwo things that Hamilton will look to work on during preseason practices is defense and figuring out his rotation. The Seminoles suffered from a lack of depth last season but this year he could have a roster that goes 10 deep and allows him to go to more of a full-court pressing style of defense.\nXavier Rahan-Mayes led the team in scoring last season, averaging 14.9 points en route to becoming the first freshman in ACC history to score 30 or more points three times. The one thing he said he noticed in preseason practices were that everyone played off each other's strengths.\nFlorida State's first exhibition game is Nov. 2 against Lynn University before opening the season on Nov. 15 against Nicholls State.\n''I think we have a pretty good combination of experience and an influx of new players. Any time you have that type of scenario you appreciate it,'' Hamilton said. ''It looks like we have it moving in the right direction. We've had a good offseason and regrouped.''\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:20:22.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
