Follow along with our live blog below.\n\n\n--\nPREVIEW \nThe United States will battle Mexico on Saturday night in the CONCACAF Cup, as the region's top rivarly takes center stage at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. Here's everything you need to know about the match, which will see over 90,000 pack the venue. \nTime: 9:30 p.m. EST\nTV: FS1\nIt's about to get weird!! #USAvMEX #bringyourlungs #1N1T #UnitedStates #USA #DosACero #TBT #HereWeGo pic.twitter.com/bhli5LoS3G \n— Frankie Hejduk (@FrankieHejduk2) October 9, 2015 What's at stake? A spot in the 2017 Confederations Cup, the tournament held one year before the World Cup, serving as kind of a test run for the country before the world's biggest competition arrives. The next one will be in Russia. \nProjecting the US starting XI: Guzan; Beasley, Besler, Cameron, Johnson; Zardes, Bradley, Jones, Yedlin; Dempsey; Altidore.\nProjecting the Mexico starting XI: Munoz; Layun, Moreno, Reyes, Marquez, Aguilar; Herrera, Guardado, J. Dos Santos; Vela, Hernandez. \nUSMNT's best player: Goalkeeper Tim Howard, who will likely be on the bench as Jurgen Klinsmann has stated since the Gold Cup that the plan is to go with Brad Guzan in goal. \nRivalries don't die. Forever linked. Next chapter. United we stand. #TBT #USAvMEX #OneNationOneTeam pic.twitter.com/EKCrhIOp4Z \n— Cobi Jones (@cobijones) October 8, 2015 Mexico's best player: Midfielder Andres Guardado of PSV. A talented, pacey midfielder who can strike from long distance, Guardado is one of Mexico's most complete players. And, he isn't afraid to show off his confidence on Twitter. His tweet below reads, \"For them, it's another sport. For us, it's everything. Soccer is ours, and we are going to reclaim it.\"\n\nPara ellos es un deporte más, para nosotros es todo #ElFutbolEsNuestro y vamos a reclamarlo @miseleccionmx @adidasmx pic.twitter.com/7AcIIKZMPe \n— Andrés Guardado (@AGuardado18) September 29, 2015 Matchup to watch: Mexico's attack against the backline of the US. Mexico won't have Giovani Dos Santos due to injury, but Javier 'Chicharito' Hernandez and Carlos Vela will cause enough headaches in attack. The backline of the US must keep its shape and try to keep Vela inside. The Real Sociedad winger can cause some trouble if he can get around the outside of the defense, with 'Chicharito' clinical in the air. It's about being composed for the US defense in a tough test. \nWho has the advantage? \nUS attack vs. Mexico defense: Mexico, but mainly because of the lack of talent up top for the US. Until Jozy Altidore proves he has what it takes to come up in big matches, Mexico's defense with Diego Reyes will have the edge. \nUS midfield vs. Mexico midfield: Push...if Michael Bradley shows up. He hasn't been consistent in the middle, giving the ball away too much only to deliver a near-perfect pass over the top to attackers moments later. Mexico's midfield helps out plenty in attack, so there should be space for Bradley to feed balls forward with time. \n#TBT : \"The Stare Down\" c/o @OguchiOnyewu5 #USMNT #USAvMEX #1N1T pic.twitter.com/l5sJC2lXs4 \n— U.S. Soccer (@ussoccer) October 8, 2015 US defense vs. Mexico attack: Until the US finds the right combination of players at the back, this will always go to Mexico. The problem with the unit has been reacting to the ball. Here's a perfect example from the Gold Cup. Watch how John Brooks (who isn't on the team due to injury) doesn't react quick enough as Darren Mattock's gets a slick header past Brad Guzan. Why is he waiting for the ball to come down? He needs to be getting into position early and preparing to clear it rather than waiting a few seconds to respond to a throw-in. It's a common theme for the US, and it must clean it up.\nThe US will win if... It can remain composed at the back. \nMexico will win if... It can get by the outside defenders on the wing to create chances. \nPrediction: US wins, 2-1. Klinsmann's job may be on the line.
