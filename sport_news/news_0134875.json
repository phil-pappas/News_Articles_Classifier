Reynolds Razorback Stadium, but after 60 minutes and four overtime periods the Razorbacks prevailed 54-46.\nAuburn (4-3, 1-3 SEC) came back from deficits of 14-0, 21-14, 24-21 and 38-31 but could not make the play to win the game.\nAuburn coach Gus Malzahn was proud of his team's mettle and also recognized their disappointment.\n\"It's a tough way to lose right there and we had some chances; we just couldn't make a play when we needed to,\" Malzahn said. \"Obviously you got to give Arkansas credit; they responded numerous times when they had to and made plays and we just didn't get it done at that aspect.\"\nAuburn's offense was able to find some success on the game-tying drive to end regulation and during the first three overtime periods.\nRELATED: Drops prove costly in Auburn's 4OT loss at Arkansas\nRicardo Louis, who was among several Tigers receivers with drops on Saturday, made three receptions for 60 yards to setup Daniel Carlson's game-tying 41-yard field goal at the end of regulation.\nPeyton Barber had 52 of his 120 rushing yards and three of his four touchdowns in overtime , but it was not enough.\n\"It was a tough game but at the same time you've got to have amnesia,\" Barber said. \"This isn't something that you can dwell on.\"\nAuburn's defense, which held Arkansas to 357 yards during regulation in what was one of the unit's better performances, was unable to make a late stand in overtime.\nAuburn CB Carlton Davis Auburn CB Carlton Davis discusses four-overtime loss at Arkansas. (James Crepea/jcrepea@al.com)\nArkansas faced fourth downs during the first and third overtime periods but managed to score touchdowns on both plays, adding a two-point conversion to the latter of the scores.\nRELATED: Arkansas loss 'like a nagging stab' to Auburn's defense\nThe Razorbacks (3-4, 2-2 SEC) gained 100 yards during the four overtime periods with Drew Morgan's 25-yard catch the deciding points.\n\"We had our countless opportunities there in overtime to make some plays to win the game,\" Auburn defensive coordinator Will Muschamp said. \"You're in position on the road in the Southeastern Conference to win the game and that's where we were. Very disappointed with the outcome for our players because they've worked extremely hard and put a lot into this game. Extremely gut wrenching for them.\"\nThough Muschamp doesn't believe \"you can get anything out of a loss,\" he felt the Tigers improved \"a lot\" in run defense.\nAuburn defensive coordinator Will Muschamp: Oct. 25, 2015 Auburn defensive coordinator Will Muschamp looks back on the loss to Arkansas and previews Ole Miss on Oct. 25, 2015. (Wesley Sinor/wsinor@al.com)\nMuschamp cited containing Alex Collins (25 carries for 105 yards and a touchdown) to a long of 13 yards as a sign of \"tremendous strides\" for a rush defense that ranks 12th in the SEC .\nAfter frustration with a lack of effort during the loss at LSU earlier this season, there was a far different feeling with Saturday's performance even if the result was the same.\n\"We battled out butt off,\" Muschamp said. \"We competed hard in the game and to get ourselves to 24-24 at the end of the game. To respond down there to force a field goal (on Arkansas' final drive of regulation) â€“ I mean there' s a lot of positives from an effort standpoint, from a leverage and formation standpoint, that maybe don't show up as far as the statistics are concerned.
