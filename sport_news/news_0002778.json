Tonight number three in 3A Cedar Rapids Xavier took on the number one team in 1A Iowa City Regina. The Regals are a dominant force and they are once again looking to dominate on their home turf. First series of the game Regina Quarterback Nathan Stenger would call his own number and stride into the end zone... A sign of things to come perhaps? With the PAT the Regals go up seven to nothing early. Xavier would answer right back. Bryce Schulte would hit Blake Whitten with a sideline pass and Whitten for a 30 yard touchdown run. The extra point would be good and we have a tied ball game. Still in the first from one yard out Stenger would push it up the middle for a TD. The PAT is also good. The Regals go up 14 to seven. In the second quarter it would be Nicholas Phillips time to shine. He takes the handoff and he would go 25 yards to the big house, a few minutes later he would do it again. Phillips playing like a man possessed. Regina would go up 28 to seven shortly before halftime. Xavier rallied in the second for a 38-35 victory on a last second field goal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:23:03.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
