(THE CANADIAN PRESS/Adrian Wyld) Questions linger as clock ticks down on Toronto 2024 Olympic bid \nMONTREAL -- The Canadian Olympic Committee says it is expanding its investigations to examine any complaints that are brought to its attention with regard to the conduct of its president, Marcel Aubut. \nThe committee said in a statement today it is looking for an independent third party to lead the process and that it is encouraging anyone who has concerns to contact the organization. \nAubut temporarily stepped aside as president of the committee and chairman of the Canadian Olympic Foundation late Wednesday after a sexual harassment allegation came to light. \nThe COC has already appointed Francois Rolland, a former chief justice of the Quebec Superior Court, to investigate that complaint. The allegations have not been proven and a COC spokesman says that probe will continue. \nSince then, more complaints against Aubut have surfaced in the media from two other women, including one who worked closely with him at a Montreal law firm. \nThe COC statement says the organization is very concerned by the allegations that have been made and that it is committed to taking any necessary actions following Rolland's findings or any other findings \nIn a statement Wednesday night after the initial complaint, Aubut described the allegations as a \"remark he allegedly made to a colleague\" and that he'd offered his \"unconditional support\" to those investigating the matter. He has not had any further public comment. Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T23:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:47:10.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
