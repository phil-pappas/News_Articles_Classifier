Teams that we thought we would be contenders are early-season disasters. Players we thought would explode this year are stuck in neutral. And a rule change we thought would improve the game has pretty much only served to make it longer.\nHere are a few observations and opinions from the first couple of weeks of watching this great and maddening game:\n•      T.J. Brodie must be one heck of a player.\nThe Flames defenseman suffered a broken bone in his hand in camp and has yet to play for Calgary. But the Flames stole Dougie Hamilton from the Bruins. No problem, right? Well, it’s a big problem. The Flames slid Hamilton into Brodie’s spot on the top pair with Mark Giordano (last year’s leading Norris Trophy candidate before he got hurt) and the early returns have been a disaster. Going into Friday’s game against Detroit, both Hamilton and Giordano were minus-6 and had just one goal each. In the OT win against the Red Wings, Hamilton was dropped to the third pair and Dennis Wideman was moved up and Giordano responded with a 2-1-3, plus-3 night.\nThe Flames’ 2-5 start is so disappointing Sportsnet reported that GM Brad Treliving is seeking a major deal to change things up. He’d be well-served to wait until Brodie gets back and see how it all comes together. Hamilton should be better when he’s dropped down and not playing against top line competition. And while he may never get much better in his own zone — it just doesn’t seem as important to him as putting up points — his offensive production will improve. He’s too gifted a player for it not to. But it didn’t take long for the Flames to see that they might not be getting as complete a package as they thought when they got Hamilton.\n•      The coaches challenge needs to be fixed.\nBruins personnel were left shaking their heads in Glendale, Az., last Saturday when the refs failed to overturn a Coyotes goal after Joe Vitale entered the crease and backed right into Tuukka Rask. Some time did elapse before Shane Doan’s shot pinballed its way over the goal line, but Rask’s ability to make the save was clearly affected by Vitale’s contact. Just a week prior to that, the B’s had a goal waived off for what the ref ruled as goalie interference by Patrice Bergeron. Claude Julien challenged and the replay showed that Bergeron walked an incredible tightrope while being checked by Alexei Emelin, and he never entered the blue paint. Still, the ref refused to overturn his call.\nGoing into Friday’s game, there had been 12 challenges and only four calls overturned. Now, either coaches still don’t know what constitutes some rules violations, or refs are reluctant to admit they were wrong. Maybe a it’s a little bit of both.\nNHL refs have the most difficult job of any officials of any major sport. It’s an incredibly fast game that challenges refs both physically and mentally. I can’t count how many times I’ve had to watch a replay of a controversial play three or four times only to come to the same conclusion that the ref did in real time. It’s only natural for them to get their hackles up a bit when challenged. That’s why these challenges should be decided by hockey operations in Toronto, just as the previously reviewable goals have been. If anything, it would at least improve the consistency.\n•     Even Zac Rinaldo can get justice.\nI didn’t like Bruins forward Rinaldo’s hit on the Flyers’ Sean Couturier Wednesday, mainly because it was unnecessary. With only seconds left in the period, it served no purpose and felt cheap. As Julien pointed out while defending the hit, it wasn’t exactly good fundamental hockey, either. And while the head may not have been the principal point of contact, if you hit someone high enough in the chest, as Rinaldo did, contact with the head is inevitable.\nBut the Department of Player Safety deserves credit for following the letter of the law as it saw it. Suspending Rinaldo for a game or two would have been the easiest thing in the world to do. He’s got a well-documented rap sheet, and a brief suspension probably would have placated the Flyers and much of the hockey world. The Bruins may not have even squawked too much, either.\nBut the department did not let Rinaldo’s repeat offender status bleed into the determination of whether it was a legal hit or not, which was the just approach.\nThat said, the league’s vigilance against head injuries needs to be re-upped. There is a two-minute minor in the rule book for “an illegal check to the head.” How can that be in this day and age, with all we now know about concussions?\n•      How’d I get fooled by the Blue Jackets?\nOk, I’ll admit. I took the cheese. I saw the 13-0-1 record down the stretch last season, factored in the early season injuries and the acquisition of Brandon Saad and — voila! — I saw a Columbus contender. I did not see the historically bad start (0-8), the worst since the 1943-44 Rangers went 0-11.\nSeven straight losses was enough to get Todd Richards fired. He was replaced by John Tortorella, who immediately improved the team’s play, if not the win-loss column. In his debut in a 3-2 loss in Minnesota, Tortorella made his presence felt by taking his player, Ryan Johansen, off the top line and benching him for the final 6:10 when they needed a goal to tie it.\nWe’ll see in the next few weeks if the Jackets just needed a swift kick in the butt. Or maybe they just needed better goaltending.\n•      Even a blind squirrel can find a nut.\nThe belief in the Blue Jackets may have been off-base, but I’m sticking with the pick of the Washington Capitals as the Eastern Conference reps in the Stanley Cup finals. It’s hard to ignore the Canadiens and the start they’ve had — the best in their storied history. They went into the weekend having allowed just seven goals in seven games. But they’re a bit too reliant on the great Carey Price for my liking.\nThe Caps are both a heavy and tremendously skilled team. And unlike the Washington teams of Alex Ovechkin’s early years, they have the defense and goaltending that can sustain a long run in the playoffs.\nThis week’s B’s timeline\nTuesday vs. Arizona, 7 p.m. — The surprising Coyotes have come down to earth after a strong start. But youngsters Anthony Duclair and Max Domi will be worth the price of admission on some nights. The first two periods in Glendale, Az., last week were the Bruins’ best two periods of the season.\nFriday at Florida, 7:30 p.m. — The Panthers may still not have graduated to contender status but they’re not to be taken lightly any more. The B’s pretty much had their season ended last year by this team on an April night in Sunrise, Fla..\nSaturday at Tampa Bay, 7 p.m. — The B’s played well in the early going against the Lightning at the Garden on Columbus day, but fizzled out. The Bolts have plenty of firepower and are much better than they were defensively. But I’m still not sure if Ben Bishop is an elite goaltender.\nSTRIDES FOR LUCIC, KINGS\nWhen Milan Lucic was first put on a line with Anze Kopitar and Marian Gaborik, the reviews were glowing, before there was any real evidence that the line would click. And through five games with the Kings, Lucic was still looking for his first goal.\nThe ever-sardonic Darryl Sutter was still searching for a landing spot for the former Bruins star last week.\n“I mean, I was told that he fits with Kopitar and Gaborik,” the coach told LA Kings Insider. “I mean, that’s what everybody that knew everything about hockey in North America told me. You know what? I don’t know where he fits.”\nFear not. After being put on a line with Jeff Carter and Tyler Toffoli, Lucic popped in his first goal of the season in Thursday’s revenge win over the Sharks, who had thumped the Kings in their season opener.\nThere’s still time for Lucic, and the Kings, to have the kind of year everyone expected.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=Early+returns+serve+to+alter+impressions", "http://player.mediabong.net/se/56.js?url="], "published": "2015-10-25T13:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:25:43.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
