Down 14-9, Dakota Richard fumbled the opening kickoff of the second half and Steinbach (4-1) recovered the ball. The Sabres scored a touchdown shortly after that. \nCrocus (1-4) had its punt blocked on its next possession and Steinbach made the Plainsmen pay with another touchdown, which seemed to suck the life out of the home side. \n“Whenever we get bad field position we start doubting ourselves and that’s when the bad plays start happening and we have to stop that,” said Plainsmen defensive back Cordell Chartrand, who had 11 defensive tackles and two more on special teams. “That’s what’s holding us back right now.” \nCrocus stayed close for the entire first half. Quarterback Sam Esler connected with Theo Bolme for a 60-yard touchdown strike in the second quarter and Matt Olive tied it with the convert. Olive kicked a single on the ensuing kickoff and another on a punt to give the Plainsmen a two-point lead. \nHowever, Mack Dueck intercepted an Esler pass and returned it 62 yards to the house to give Steinbach a lead it wouldn’t relinquish. Crocus struggled to move the ball after that. \n“The kids played tough,” said Crocus head coach Kevin Boyd. “This is a darn good team in Steinbach. We started off quite well, it was 14-9 at the half and I thought we were doing quite well and then normally we’re a second half team but we came out flat in the first part of the second half but they never gave up. I’m proud of the effort they put up.” \nEsler completed 10 of 26 passes for 188 yards, a touchdown and an interception. He also rushed for 21 yards. Reilly Keele added 58 yards on the ground, while Bolme had three receptions for 115 yards. Treven Prince-Richard hauled in two passes for 37 yards. \nCole Kardash and Brandon Escoto both had four defensive tackles for Crocus, with Kardash adding two more on special teams. \nThe loss puts a big dent in the hopes of the Plainsmen to remain in the Tier 2 playoffs. Only the top six teams in the Vidruk Division qualify for its playoffs, while the bottom four drop to the Tier 3 playoffs. The Plainsmen are one win back of a top six placing and they close out the season by playing Elmwood (4-1) in Winnipeg next week and hosting Kildonan East (0-5) on Oct. 22. \nThe players aren’t worried about what is to come just yet. \n“We just focus on the next game and winning that next game to get us into the AA playoffs because that’s our main goal right now is keeping us in the playoffs,” Chartrand said. \nMeanwhile, the Vincent Massey Vikings (1-4) won their first game of the season 32-7 over the host Reivers (0-5) on Friday. \nTyler Rowan ran for 241 yards and a touchdown on 13 carries for the Vikings, while Mack Adams added 214 more yards and two other scores on 18 carries. \nJoel Fisseha led the defence with seven tackles, an interception, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. He also scored a two-point convert. Phoenix Zelasko chipped in with seven tackles and a pick. \nMassey returns home to host the River East Kodiaks (5-0) on Thursday. \n» cjaster@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:13:31.874+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
