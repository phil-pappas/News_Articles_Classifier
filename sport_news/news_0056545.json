(AP) Wisconsin forward Malayna Johnson will miss the 2015-16 season with a torn ACL, nearly a year after teammate and older sister Michala suffered a similar season-ending injury. \nBadgers coach Bobbie Kelsey said Wednesday that Malayna Johnson was injured in practice. She will redshirt this season and have two years of eligibility. \nMalayna Johnson averaged 4 points in about 14 minutes a game last season, playing all 29 contests. \nHer sister, Michala, transferred from Connecticut in 2012. The senior played six games last season and averaged 12.8 points a game before tearing her left ACL on Dec. 4. \nMichala Johnson is returning to the Badgers this season after being granted a medical hardship waiver by the NCAA. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:12:15.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
