It was one of the most complete victories we’ve ever had against Brockton High School. I’m very proud of our guys and coaches.”\nThe Xaverian defense wasted little time making its presence felt. A Coby Tippett interception gave the Hawks prime real estate on the Boxers 35-yard line, and they cashed in three plays later. Pina connected with A.J. Ryan on a 23-yard touchdown pass in the right corner of the end zone to give Xaverian a quick 7-0 lead.\nThe score remained that until the final stages of the first half. The Hawks drove 65 yards in 10 plays, with Tippett capping it off by catching a 4-yard TD pass to extend the lead to 13-0 with 29 seconds left in the second quarter.\nXaverian then recovered an onside kick on the Brockton 42 and was poised to put the game out of reach. Back-to-back completions to Tippett on the right sideline moved the ball to the 21 with seconds remaining. Pina fired a dart across the middle to Piccinin for a touchdown, only to have the play called back by a holding penalty.\nThe Hawks resumed control in the third quarter and added to the lead, Pina connecting with Tippett for a 24-yard TD to make it 20-0 with 5:19 left. That cushion was more than enough thanks to the stellar play of the defense, which held the Boxers (3-2) to 46 yards of total offense and without a first down until the two-minute mark of the third quarter.\nPiccinin and Dean closed out the scoring in the fourth, running for touchdowns of 3 and 2 yards, respectively. Stevenson hopes the balanced attack — 186 rushing yards, 115 passing yards — will silence those critical of the Xaverian offense.\n“People who think we are only one dimensional are usually making a big mistake,” Stevenson said. “We can do what we want when we want. If people think we can’t do it, that’s fine with me. I’m proud of my kids, they played great and executed well.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:56:55.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
