It's about having the best trick bag.\nThe Bobcats' 14-12 victory may not have produced offensive fireworks in the rain and cold at the Akron homecoming at InfoCision Stadium, but the announced crowd of 17,301 witnessed two trick plays that ultimately decided the game.\nAfter smoothly advancing to the Bobcats 18 the first time it had the ball, the Zips went to the trick bag for a reverse.\n\"We wanted to do one first,'' Akron head coach Terry Bowden said after the game, knowing that OU coach Frank Solich had a bag of his own. \"It worked the last time we ran it.\"\nThis time the play blew up. Instead of taking off to the flat for perhaps a small gain, or throwing the ball out of bounds, Akron wide receiver Tyrell Goodman froze in the backfield during the reverse and was tackled for a loss. The Zips ultimately kicked a field goal for a 3-0 lead.\nOU quarterback Derrius Vick soon ran to perfection a trick play from Solich. Nearly all the Bobcats went one way on a miss-direction, and tight end Kevin Heitzman slowly went the other. Uncovered, he scored on the 23-yard pass. The Bobcats never trailed again.\n\"Those gadget plays, when they don't work, they'll get you,'' Bowden said. \"The gadget play we ran was supposed to do the same thing.''\nIt didn't, so the Zips fell to 2-3, 0-1 in the opening game of Mid-American Conference play. The Bobcats are off to a 4-1, 1-0 start.\nThe Bobcats jumped ahead, 14-3, on their next possession.\nA penalty-riddled Akron defense fueled the 11-play touchdown drive that ended early in the second quarter.\nAkron's offense mounted a drive of its own that went into Bobcats territory. Facing a second-and-three at the 32, the Zips again opted for cute instead of power, missing on a pass play, got penalized, then punted.\nBefore the end of the half, the Zips crossed midfield. And again Akron went cute with three straight passes for naught to spoil the scoring chance.\nThe Zips got the ball back on OU's side of he field with 2:13 to go in the half. But only twice -- once on fourth down -- did Akron give the ball to a tailback. The result, a field goal by Robert Stein, from 33 yards out, to cut OU's lead to 14-6.\nAn Akron team that seemed to turn its season around with improved quarterback play, and a running game worth 511 yards and eight TD in its two previous wins, stood at 35 yards rushing at halftime against the Bobcats and closing in on a nearly 3:1 ratio of pass to run.\nLate in the third quarter, the Zips mounted a drive that earned a first down at OU's 18. Incomplete passes and penalties left them with a 3rd-and-21, resulting in a 41-yard Stein field goal to shave the Bobcats lead to 14-9.\nThe pattern continued into the fourth quarter with the Zips again moving. A big penalty and missed passes forced Akron to settle for a 30-yard Stein field goal with 3:55 to play. The Bobcats lead was two points.\nAkron had one more chance, but turned the ball over on downs as a fourth-and-four pass was incomplete. The Bobcats ran out the clock.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:09:49.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
