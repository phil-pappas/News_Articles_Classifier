Marvin Kinsey, Jr. had a game-high 70 yards rushing while Porter Sanford threw touchdown passes to Evan Crossing and Brandon Moore in the win. Riverwood’s defense held the Yellow Jackets to 107 yards of total offense.“Our defense stole the show,” Riverwood coach Ben Stready said about the Sprayberry contest. “It was one of the most dominant performances I’ve ever had the pleasure to be a part of. We knew going in that it would be a low scoring game and that we would have to be calculated on offense, taking shots when they presented themselves.”The Raiders, who have already matched last season’s win total with five victories as of Oct. 8, aren’t looking ahead to a postseason bid before the regular season ends.“We have put ourselves in a great position as far as the sub-region is concerned,” Stready said. “The playoffs is a conversation for a later date. We still have three sub-region games to play and our focus is one game at a time.”Riverwood will visit Kell in Marietta this Friday looking to give the Longhorns their second region loss of the season.

Holy Spirit Prep needs one win to get into the postseason.“This year has been ups and downs but our team motto of family has been wonderful to watch,” Cougars coach David Rosenzweig said. “This is a very tight knit group that works on the field daily to overcome our lack of size compared to other teams. The defense has played tremendously the past month allowing just 35 points in the past 3 games.”Holy Spirit Prep and The Heritage School’s lifetime series is tied 2-2 with the Hawks taking last season’s game 42-7.Westminster will host Blessed Trinity out of Roswell this Friday looking to keep pace in the Region 4AAA standings.
