Comment Posted Oct. 7, 2015 at 11:20 PM By Chris Zadorozny Posted Oct. 7, 2015 at 11:20 PM SUNFIELD - For the fourth consecutive year, the Lakewood Vikings girls golf team came in second place in the regional match. For the fourth consecutive year, they also qualified for the state finals as a team. “(There are) many things to be happy about,” said Lakewood head coach Carl Kutch. “(We’re) moving onto state finals for the fourth year in a row as a team, that’s a huge accomplishment.” Of course, Kutch wanted that regional championship, something they’ve been gunning for the previous three years. “We thought we had a real good chance and we did,” said Kutch. “Hastings is a very good team. Their depth had a little bit of an edge on us today.” Hosting the regional at Centennial Acres, Lakewood senior Emily Barker finished first overall with a 73, her best score of the season for 18-holes. “(I) couldn’t be happier for Emily, medalist today, outstanding round,” said Kutch. Emily was very happy with her round too. “It was really special,” said Barker after walking of the 18th green. “For anybody that’s played golf, they know how hard it is to not look ahead. I felt like I was able to stay focused throughout the round and post my best score of the season and I’ve been waiting to just have that breakout round and I think I saved it for the right time.” Barker shot four birdies on the day, with three coming on the front nine. Also in the top five finishers, junior Maranda Barton who shot an 88 to finish in fifth place. Taylor Hopkins shot a 100, Kate Richmond shot a 102 and Kayla Blair shot 113. Lakewood scored a team total of Kutch knows there are things to take from this as they move toward the Division 3 state finals in just over a week. “Hopefully, we just kind of keep the momentum, learn from each event, each hole, each shot and try to grow a little bit more and just go give it our best at state finals,” said Kutch. “You never know what’ll happen there, it’s the biggest stage for Michigan high school golf.” Barker and Barton both have experience playing at the state finals. “I think it’s huge because you don’t understand the nerves until you get on that first tee box, about to hit your first shot with so many people around,” said Barker of the experience all three have. “I think it definitely can hurt a lot of golfers and so this week, Maranda and I will try to share knowledge of how to stay in the moment, stay focused and be able to help our teammates get through it.” Page 2 of 2 - When asked if she had any final thoughts on the day and upcoming state finals, all Barker could muster was, “save your best golf for October.” It looks like that’s what Lakewood did on Wednesday. Ionia also battled hard through the fog early at Centennial Acres. They finished in 13th out of 15 teams. “I thought overall, our girls golfed very well,” said Ionia head coach Doug Tackmann. “It’s a tough course where most of them had one or two bad holes.” Evelyn Velasco shot a 98, just five strokes shy of qualifying for the state finals. “As a senior, this was her last competitive round for Ionia golf and she was five strokes away from making it to the state finals,” said Tackmann. “I’m very proud of that.” Following her was Mallory Hausserman with 107, Maddie Castle with 116, Logan Stephens with 124 and Sarah Correll with 173. Lakewood will play in the Division 3 state finals on Friday and Saturday, October 16-17 at Forest Akers West. Follow Sports Editor Chris Zadorozny on Twitter @ZadsISS.
