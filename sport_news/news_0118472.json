There were innings limits. There was Yoenis Cespedes. And Wednesday night, there was the first NL pennant for Flushing in 15 years. For the first time since 2000, the Mets are the National League champions, the culmination of a season in which they overcame adversity and made bold trades to bolster an at times lifeless offense. Here’s a look at 15 of the ups and downs of the 2015 season, which continues Tuesday when the Mets play in Game 1 of the World Series.\nMarch 16 \nBefore the regular season begins, the Mets’ pitching staff takes a big hit as Zack Wheeler is lost for the season with a torn UCL in his right elbow. The Mets were counting on big things from Wheeler in his third season, yet lose him to Tommy John surgery. The team’s optimism seems as if it may need to be slowed.\nMarch 30 \nWho said GM Sandy Alderson can’t make deals for the present? In what would foreshadow an aggressive trade deadline, Alderson pulls off two deals for lefty relievers – Jerry Blevins and Alex Torres – to make up for the team’s lack of lefty relievers following the loss of primary lefty specialist Josh Edgin to Tommy John surgery.\nApril 6 \nOn a staff of youngsters, it’s the veteran who gets the job done. Instead of giving the opening day start against Washington to one of his young stars, Terry Collins gives the ball to Bartolo Colon. Colon sets the tone for the season by limiting the Nationals to one run in six innings in a 3-1 win, and outduels Nationals ace Max Scherzer.\nApril 14 \nDavid Wright’s season ended early in 2014, and he is sidelined early in 2015 when his hamstring flares while stealing second base in the eighth inning of a 6-5 win over the Phillies. A Mets team that was expecting a lot from Wright, and has a lot invested in him financially, suddenly was without one of its top bats early in the year. Wright would later be diagnosed with spinal stenosis and not return until Aug. 24.\nApril 19 \nIt started looking as if perhaps this wasn’t the Mets’ year. As the team improves to 10-3 on the year, it loses catcher Travis d’Arnaud and Jerry Blevins in a win over Miami. D’Arnaud would be sidelined until early June, and Blevins did not throw another pitch. The Mets were now down five key players and the season wasn’t even a month old.\nMay 12 \nWelcome to the show, rookie. Noah Syndergaard makes his much-anticipated debut in a 6-1 loss to the Cubs. While Syndergaard gets tagged with the loss, it begins a fantastic rookie season for him that would help the team eventually make the playoffs. Syndergaard shows flashes of being the dynamic pitcher he should develop into.\nJune 24 \nTime to panic. Despite being 10 games above .500 earlier in the year, the Mets drop to 36-37 on the year after losing their seventh straight game, a 4-1 defeat to the Brewers. The offense continues to waste stellar pitching performances, and the calls for Sandy Alderson to make a deal to bolster the offense get louder and louder with each game.\nJuly 3 \nThis may have been the game that changed the season. The Mets were 40-40 and had to face Clayton Kershaw, and in a sign of things to come, they battled him tough before scoring the winning run in the ninth in a 2-1 victory. The Mets finished 4-2 on the road trip against the Dodgers and Giants, and saved their season.\nJuly 29 \nThere’s no crying in baseball, but if you do, you can become the most popular player on the team. Wilmer Flores cries during a game against the Padres after believing he’s been traded to the Brewers, and when the deal is nixed he becomes a favorite among Mets fans. Flores also goes on a tear after not being dealt and contributes big hits, and receives rousing ovations everywhere he goes, including road venues.\nJuly 31 \nSandy Alderson finally goes all-in. Although he had already acquired Kelly Johnson, Juan Uribe and Tyler Clippard, those were complementary pieces. His team needed the big bopper. Enter Yoenis Cespedes. The Mets finally get that dynamic bat they needed in the middle of their lineup, and Cespedes’ arrival makes the Mets legitimate contenders.\nSept. 5 \nOn this day, it appears the Dark Knight might not be there when Gotham needs him the most. With talks of his season being limited to 180 innings, Matt Harvey did not outright say he will pitch in the playoffs or beyond 180 innings in a talk with the media at Marlins Park, and it heightened the possibility he might not pitch in October. The next day, though, Harvey wrote an essay saying he would pitch in the playoffs.\nSept. 9 \nDrew Storen, meet Yoenis Cespedes. The Mets all but end the NL East race by sweeping the Nationals in their park. Cespedes provides the go-ahead blast in the eighth with a two-run homer off Storen to break a 2-2 tie. The Mets leave Nationals Park with a seven-game lead, and the Nationals never get closer than six games the rest of the year.\nSept. 26 \nPop the champagne: the Mets are the NL East champions. After nine years without a division title, the Mets end their futility by defeating the Reds, 10-2, at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati. It clinched the team’s first postseason berth since 2006, and was the reward for eight seasons that were marred by collapses and non-competitive teams.\nOct. 15 \nBring on the Cubbies. The Mets beat both Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke in the NLDS, and win 3-2 in Game 5 to advance to the NLCS. The legend of Jacob deGrom grows, as one game after besting Kershaw he defeats Greinke to help the Mets advance. Daniel Murphy also has a showing for the ages, including the go-ahead homer.\nOct. 21 \nFifteen years after the Subway Series, the Mets are back in the World Series. They dominate the Cubs in a four-game sweep, and never trail at any point. Murphy hits his seventh homer of the postseason and sets a record with six straight games with a homer, and the Cubs’ bats are no match for the Mets’ young staff of power arms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T00:02:59.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
