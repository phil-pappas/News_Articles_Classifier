Gators search for kicker Associated Press 8:30 p.m. EDT October 19, 2015 Florida kicker Jorge Powell kicks an unsuccessful extra-point attempt against Ole Miss on Oct. 3 in Gainesville. (Photo: Gary McCullough/AP) 10 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nGAINESVILLE — Florida’s kicking situation has gone from depleted to desperate. \nThe 13th-ranked Gators sent out an “all call” for kickers Monday after Jorge Powell was injured at LSU. Powell was run over during a kickoff. And with top kicker Austin Hardin also dealing with a leg injury, coach Jim McElwain has few, if any, other options on his roster. \nSo Florida took to Twitter “looking for walk-on kickers.” The team asked for any interested and eligible students to visit the football office by 4:30 p.m. Monday for a tryout. \nThe good news for the Gators (6-1, 4-1 Southeastern Conference) is they are off this week before playing rival Georgia (5-2, 3-2) in Jacksonville on Halloween. So they have extra time to get healthy or get a walk-on up to speed.
