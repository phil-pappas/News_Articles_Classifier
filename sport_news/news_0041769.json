Charlotte has painted the marks to make the zone clear in what's been an ongoing issue. \nDrivers have complained for the last several months about shenanigans in the restart zone that NASCAR was not policing. NASCAR three races ago assigned an official to monitor the restart zone at track level, and it is now using in-race reviews to decide if a driver broke the rules. \nBrad Keselowski was flagged for jumping the restart at Dover two weeks ago. He's so far the only driver to be penalized. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:28:23.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
