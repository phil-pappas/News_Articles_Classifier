The Panthers improved to 7-0 overall and 3-0 in the district. It was the first district loss in three games for Royal Palm (3-4).\n\"I'll trade a loss with St. Thomas [Aquinas] right now if we can be that No. 1 at the end of the year, which is what matters,\" Dwyer 20-year coach Jack Daniels said. \"St. Thomas has played a brutal schedule. We're thinking about winning our district. That's all we're thinking about.\"\nJunior quarterback Eli Mathews, playing in Centeio's absence, threw for two touchdowns and ran for two others. Mathews connected with sophomore speedster Oyeh Lurry-Davis on first-half scoring passes of 14 and 65 yards, respectively. He also had a pair of 1-yard TD runs in the victory.\nDespite not having the services of Centeio, who has been out because of an undisclosed condition, Dwyer never trailed in the game.\nThe Panthers rode the running of junior RB Jakari Moses. Moses rushed for 181 yards on 30 carries. Dwyer led 21-19 at the half and took a 28-19 lead with 9:22 remaining on Mathews' final TD run. Mathews finished just 3-of-14 passing for 93 yards. Lurry-Davis had two catches for 79 yards and enjoyed a huge night in the return game.\nThe timetable for Centeio's return remains a mystery. He said before the game he expected to be back but was not sure of when. Daniels is hoping he can return to practice Monday but he has to be cleared by doctors.\nSenior QB Josh Carr ran for a 23-yard TD for Royal Palm and he also threw a 56-yard TD pass to Adarius Dent. Telvis Lawler led RPB on the ground with 62 yards on 14 carries.\nNeither team got on the board in the first quarter. High-powered Dwyer, in fact, had just two first downs in the first eight minutes as junior Eli Mathews went 0-for-3 passing.\nJohnson set on UF\nDwyer senior wide receiver Isaiah Johnson said he remains firm on his verbal commitment to the University of Florida. The 6-foot-3, 214-pounder said the Gators' 6-0 start has only solidified his feelings for the program.\n\"As they keep getting better, it gives me even more of a reason to be a part of a great program under great coaches,\" Johnson said of UF.\nJohnson said he recently decided to switch his official visit to Gainesville to his birthday Nov. 28 when the Gators play Florida State.\nThe Dwyer standout said he will take an official visit to West Virginia on Nov. 14. He called the Mountaineers his No. 2 school but said \"it's not a close No. 2.\" Johnson said Auburn and Miami also remain in contact with him.\n High School Football West Virginia Mountaineers", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5621b1d4/turbine/fl-dwyer-royal-palm-beach-recap-1017-20151016"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:36:21.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
