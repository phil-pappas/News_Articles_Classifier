Both sets were mirror images of each other as B-PC took the lead before Knoxville (12-11) rallied late to claim the win. \"They just will not give up,\" Knoxville coach Marci Tyrrell said. \"They just keep fighting and doing things they need to do to get the win.\" \"We've been fighting the situation all season,\" Spartans coach Stephanie Harrison said. \"We get a lead and then seem to play not to make a mistake. We've been preaching all year to stay aggressive ... mistakes will happen but we have to go on.\" In the first set there were several ties early as the teams jockeyed back and forth. After an 11-all tie, B-PC (8-22) jumped out to a 19-12 advantage. Tyrrell then called the first of her two allotted timeouts. After the break, the Blue Bullets began their surge. Following a sideout, Danielle Rossell, one of only three seniors on the team, served four straight points to cut the B-PC lead to 17-19. The two teams then exchanged side-outs as the score went to 22-23 in favor of the Spartans. At that point, after a side-out for Knoxville, Darcy Ratermann, another one of Tyrrell's seniors served out the set. In the second set, the two teams battled on even terms through the early moments with seven ties as the score reached 10 -all. At that point, just like in the first set, Bushnell-Prairie City jumped ahead to a 15-10 lead as Tiffany Slater served four points after a side-out. The visitors then added to their advantage after a pair of side-outs and three service points by Kayley Peck to make it 20-13. At that point, Knoxville began its second comeback of the night. Two more side-outs and a service point cut the B-PC lead to 20-16. After a net serve by the Spartans made it 17-20, Emily Lenz served three points for the Bullets to cut the lead to 20-21. After a service mistake by B-PC, Knoxville tied the set at 21-all. The Spartans then took a 24-21 lead with a side-out and two service points. Knoxville managed to stop the bleeding at that point after a great back line save that lead to a side-out cutting the B-PC lead to 24-23. The Spartans failed to capitalize serving for the set as a side-out enabled the Bullets to knot the score at 24-all. At that point Knoxville's Darcy Ratermann served the last two points to give her team a hard fought victory. Chloe Palmer led Knoxville with eight kills while Ratermann had 12 digs. Bailee Case added nine assists while Palmer and Ratermann recorded seven digs each. Page 2 of 2 - The Spartans were lead by Stephanie Beaird with 13 kills. Logan Brown logged 17 digs while Slater had 12 assists and a pair of aces.
