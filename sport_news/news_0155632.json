He has struck out his last seven batters and 15 overall without a walk.\nThe Mets' only runner reached on a throwing error by third baseman Yunel Escobar on Kevin Plawecki 's leadoff grounder in the sixth.\nScherzer has thrown 93 pitches on a brisk, blustery night at Citi Field in the second game of a day-night doubleheader. Washington leads 2-0.\nThis was the fifth time this season that Scherzer took a no-hit bid into the sixth inning.
