He smacked the pressure in the face, leading 264-of-312 laps on his way to victory lane, parlaying the momentum into a first-place finish in the Championship 4 race at Homestead-Miami Speedway to capture his first NASCAR Sprint Cup Series crown. \n“I think we have definitely gained a lot of confidence in knowing we can handle every different situation,” Harvick said. “I don’t think there are a lot of them that can say that. We are definitely happy that we have been through those moments and been able to capitalize on those situations.” \nUnlike Phoenix, where he owned five wins prior to the race, Harvick has failed to take a checkered flag at Dover in 29 starts – the most among active drivers without a victory. He enters the race with a little bit of encouragement, as he finished second in the spring race at the “Monster Mile.” \nDespite his dire situation, Harvick remains calm and collected. \n“This is why everybody watches,” he said. “Every situation is different. You just have to address whatever you think is right or wrong at that particular time to go out and do what is best for your team.” \nDenny Hamlin and Matt Kenseth, race winners at Chicago and New Hampshire, respectively, have already punched their tickets into the Contender Round and the other 10 spots will be filled by the winner at Dover if he is a Chase driver, with the remaining positions filled by Chase drivers with the most points. \nWDUN will have live MRN Radio coverage of Sunday's NASCAR Sprint Cup Series AAA 400 from Dover International Speedway beginning at 1:30 pm on 102.9 FM. \nNASCAR Xfinity Series: Buescher In Championship Driver’s Seat With 6 To Go \nWith just six races left in the season, Chris Buescher holds a 19-point lead over Ty Dillon in the NASCAR Xfinity Series championship standings. \n“I feel really good about our chances as we go down this homestretch,” Buescher said. “We have three race tracks that we look at as being solid for us, very good chances to go win a race (Dover, Kansas and Homestead).” \nThe 22-year-old Texan gets his next chance to extend his points advantage when he goes for the season sweep of Dover International Speedway in Saturday’s Hisense 200. Buescher played fuel-mileage strategy to perfection at the “Monster Mile” in May, beating second-place Matt Kenseth by more than 11 seconds. \nIn three career starts at Dover, Buescher has finished fourth and 11th in addition to his win for an average finish of 5.3. He enters Saturday’s showdown riding a five-race top-10 streak. \nMeanwhile, Dillon rolls into Dover coming off a runner-up finish at Kentucky and with his own streak of 10 top-10 showings in the last 11 races. The No. 3 Chevrolet driver is set on catching Buescher. \n“I think about (the points) every day and how bad I want that championship,” Dillon said. “I’ve been thinking about it since the start of the year and we’re going to keep eating. We’re hungry right now. We just have to go out there and keep getting our job done like we’re doing. \n“The 60 (Buescher’s team), they’re backpedaling a little bit right now. We’re charging and they’re thinking about us. So that’s a good thing.” \nWDUN will have live MRN Radio coverage of Saturday's NASCAR Xfinity Series Hisense 200 from Dover International Speedway beginning at 3 pm on 102.9 FM. \nNASCAR Camping World Truck Series: Championship Frontrunners Jones And Crafton ‘Odds-On’ Favorites At Vegas \nOne driver is the defending race winner, while the other dominates 1.5-mile tracks. \nErik Jones will attempt to visit Victory Lane at Las Vegas Motor Speedway for the second straight year in Saturday’s Rhino Linings 350 as he tries to hold off NASCAR Camping World Truck Series intermediate track master Matt Crafton for the series championship. \nCrafton cut Jones’ standings lead to a mere seven points after finishing runner-up last week at New Hampshire, while Jones placed seventh for his ninth consecutive top-10 showing. \nWith only six races left, the two-time defending series champion maintains he’s still not concerned about points. \n“I’m honestly not truly worried,” Crafton said. “We’re just going into each and every race trying to lead laps and win the race. If we do that, we get max points … All in all, we just have to keep racing, putting this Menards Toyota Tundra up front every week and the points will come.” \nCrafton has never won at Las Vegas, but he has three runner-up finishes there and has claimed five wins in the last two seasons at 1.5-mile tracks. \nJones is no slouch at intermediate tracks either. The NASCAR Next alum has led 44.4 percent (399) of the 898 total laps during the six Truck Series races at 1.5-mile speedways this season, but has just a pair of second-place finishes to show for it. \n“Vegas is cool, a special place for me getting my first mile-and-a-half win there,” Jones said. …“It’s a cool place for me. I’m excited to go back. It’s one of my favorite mile-and-a-half tracks and should put on a good show.” \nNASCAR Race Weekend Guide", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:54:19.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
