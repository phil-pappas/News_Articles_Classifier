The pair rose to the occasion on Wednesday, factoring in all three goals in the Hilltoppers' 3-1 win over rival Farmington. Somersworth improved to 6-7-1 with two games remaining and moved a step closer to a Division III tournament spot. “We had a lot of good shots on net,” said Somersworth coach Matt Carrington. “Michaud and Pincince are a very dynamic duo. It’s been a big source for a lot of our offense as of late.” Leading 1-0 at halftime and needing some cushion, Michaud answered the call with a superb strike. Ten minutes into the second half, Pincince lofted a pass to Michaud, who controlled it with his chest at the edge of the box, but with his back to goal the touch took the ball away. From nothing, Michaud twisted and connected for a shot; the ball curved around his defender and beat the Farmington keeper at the far post for a 2-0 lead. Pincince and Michaud struck again in the final two minutes. On a free kick from 30 yards out, Michaud sent in a dipping, curling ball to the far post. The Farmington keeper read the ball and looked ready to collect when Pincince came in from the right and got a knee to the ball to change its direction and score his second of the day to make it 3-0. Pincince, Michaud and Nick Dalesio were a difficult attacking trio for the Tigers defense to contend with. While Michaud dropped the ball off into midfield when the ball moved into the Somersworth half, Pincince and Dalesio stayed high up the pitch, waiting to run on to passes or challenge for long balls over the top. Michaud played just such a pass to the waiting Pincince in the first half. Pincince dribbled the ball across the pitch until a gap appeared, shifted the ball to his left foot and from range shot to the far post to open the scoring at 1-0 in the 12th minute. “Moving the ball around and working as a team were key today,” said Pincince. “We’d gone over these before the game and we just connected as a team today.” The Tigers were pressed for most of the afternoon but still able to get into attack. With the Hilltoppers winning the midfield in the first half, Farmington looked to Spencer DeLand to control long balls forward and then distribute to the attacking players. He passed to Adin Lampros, whose shot from the left wing beat the keeper but found the far post instead of the back of the net. In the second half just after Somersworth took a 2-0 lead, DeLand drew an excellent save from Hilltoppers’ keeper Jimmy Dalesio. “Proud of the effort we put forth,” said Tigers’ coach Greg Gilmore, whose team fell to 4-9. “If we continue to play with this intensity and this passion I think we still have a chance to sneak into the tournament.” The Tigers broke through in the final minutes of the second half. Jake Richardson had the Somersworth defense under duress a number of times in the match, and made a run on his own and scored with a low drive to end the game 3-1. “We never turned on each other and we kept pushing until the end,” said Richardson. The win was the Hilltoppers second in a row after downing Berlin 4-0 last Thursday. They visit Sanborn Tuesday and end the season at home against Kingswood next Thursday. Farmington will need to bounce back and take points from their final three matches, starting with a trip to Berlin on Friday.
