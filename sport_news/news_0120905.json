(Photo by Justin Edmonds/Getty Images) In a weekly staple, we'll discuss who's in a groove and who's in a rut for the Texas Rangers. Who's On? Shin-Soo Choo — Choo is batting over .400 in September, and over the last seven games, he's hitting .379 with a .471 on-base percentage with two doubles, three homers and nine RBIs. Prince Fielder — The big man is swinging the bat again all the sudden, hitting .379 in his last seven games with two homers and a team-high 11 RBIs in that span. Adrian Beltre — The veteran third baseman is hitting .333 with two doubles, a homer and eight RBIs in his last seven games. Martin Perez — In his last start, he had some tough luck, but he finished with six innings of work and no earned runs, despite allowing two unearned runs thanks to an Elvis Andrus error as he otherwise could have outdueled Dallas Keuchel in Houston on Sunday. Who's Off? Derek Holland — The lefty has struggled in his last few outings and takes the hill Thursday to open what appears to be a season-defining series against the Angels. In his last start on Saturday in Houston, Holland appeared to be good before he took a liner off the finger and went off the rails after that, giving up four runs on seven hits in five innings. Mitch Moreland — In his last seven games, Moreland is batting just .214 and has been killed by the strikeout — 10 in seven games.
