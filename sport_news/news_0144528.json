Readers made strong arguments for Beer, Imperial, Tin Bucket and Green Dragon. The Loyal Legion opened with 99 taps of Oregon beer, cider and mead. If we re-wrote it today, we might consider adding a bar or two, but the list mostly holds up.\nLeading up to our second-annual Bar Tab, which drops next week, The Oregonian is calling for bar nominations in a number of categories. We kicked off last week with readers' favorite Portland happy hours . This week, we're asking for your favorite beer bars. Cocktail, wine and classic bars are still to come.\nSo, what did we miss last year? What beer bars do you prefer to Belmont Station, Horse Brass Pub, Beermongers, Saraveza and the rest? To nominate your favorite, comment below, send me an email or reach out on Twitter . We'll post a poll on Friday, then announce our readers' favorite next week.\n-- Michael Russell Follow @tdmrussell", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/tdmrussell"], "published": "2015-10-08T05:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:09:46.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
