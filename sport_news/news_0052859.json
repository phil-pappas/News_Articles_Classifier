That happens when 294 mass shootings occur in the first 274 days of the year.\nAn Oct. 1 Washington Post article gave that statistic, using a definition from Mass Shooting Tracker , which defines such an event as an incident in which four or more people are killed or injured by gunfire (including the shooter). \"The tracker draws some criticism because its definition is broader than the FBI's definition, which requires three or more people to be killed by gunfire,\" the paper wrote.\nI find the broader definition including those killed or injured more informational. Counting the number of people shot gives me a better understanding of how often a mass shooting -- whether \"successful\" for a wannabe killer or not -- occurs. By Oct. 2, the day after the Umpqua shooting, the number on the tracker was already up two to 296.\nOf course, \"enough\" was enough after the first-ever senseless killing. That's why you still don't meet many kids named Cain. And the big trouble is, \"enough\" isn't in our control. Many on both sides of the gun debate feel helpless -- and should.\nDo we need different gun laws? I don't think they'd hurt, even though they'd be more cumbersome. But, balancing the desire for safety with the rights of law-abiding gun owners is far from simple. Some people want guns for protection, even if it's debatable that protection is provided by owning. Others are passionate and nostalgic about hunting and other gun-related hobbies. Most important, we need to preserve a right to own guns to retain worst-case-scenario recourse should our government ever become dangerous or untrustworthy. That's the wisdom of the Second Amendment, after all.\nThere's one thing we should all do, right now, and it doesn't require lawmakers agreeing on gun laws, citizens misguidedly becoming single-issue voters or new fought-about expenditures on health care services. We can be involved family and community members. We can help others experience love and belonging. That will bring benefits beyond tragedy prevention.\nA lot of mass shooters, like the Umpqua one, are known as loners or outcasts. (Many other killers are not dysfunctional loners, the FBI rightly reminds.) And everyone has an intense human need to belong -- even those of us who are considered emotionally healthy. Bren√© Brown, a researcher at the University of Houston Graduate College of Social Work, says, \"We are biologically, cognitively, physically, and spiritually wired to love, to be loved, and to belong. When those needs are not met, we don't function as we were meant to. We break. We fall apart. We numb. We ache. We hurt others. We get sick.\"\nThere are a lot of fault lines in a society filled with so much family breakdown. And many of society's problems -- gang affiliation, sex trafficking, shootings and so on -- have a lot to do with belonging.\nAbraham Maslow, the American psychologist known for creating Maslow's hierarchy of needs, believed the need to belong was such a major source of human motivation that it's third on his list of five human needs, sitting only behind physiological and safety needs. And according to psychologists Roy Baumeister and Mark Leary, all human beings require a certain quantity of regular and satisfying social interactions. Their absence leads to unhealthy loneliness, mental distress and instability.\nThe response to Umpqua seems a classic case of wanting the government to fix a problem that individuals might be as or more effective at handling, should we choose.\nTo prevent the creation of shooters, shootings and more, volunteer at schools if you can, offering guidance and companionship. WATCH D.O.G.S. (Dad of Great Students) is one promising program I heard about last week that's getting more male role models into schools to encourage learning, enhance school security and reduce bullying. It says Oregon has 36 schools involved. Parents should open their homes outside of school hours when possible and remind kids to be inclusive.\nThat should be the No Child Left Behind pledge of this decade.\nBeyond K-12 venues, every individual should pick a person in their workplace or sphere of influence to befriend or offer kindness to. Can you imagine the impact if all of us essentially became a \"lunch buddy\" to a member of society who feels he or she has no one?\nWe're all connected. Let's act like it.\nI'm not encouraging people to stop working politically. How laws are crafted does matter. But people need to be more than political.\nEnough is enough. We can't and shouldn't rely on the government to do all the prevention work. Pick an individual today. Host an after-school safe zone for neighborhood kids tomorrow. Get involved with WATCH D.O.G.S. Different gun laws, whether you want them or not, are only part of the puzzle. We're missing other key pieces that can create a better picture.", "external_links": ["http://shootingtracker.com/wiki/Main_Page", "http://www.fathers.com/watchdogs/schools/", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/10/01/2015-274-days-294-mass-shootings-hundreds-dead/"], "published": "2015-10-10T18:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:22:14.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
