The Longhorns, after an emotional and hard-fought 21-17 victory over visiting Roaring Fork, pulled themselves back into the postseason playoff picture and the Western Slope League race. And their fans joined the victory celebration with the Longhorns players and coaches, under the shimmering light of the scoreboard still showing the final score. Earlier, the Longhorns pushed across three touchdowns to come back from an early 7-0 deficit. “Really proud of the boys; best game of the year,” Basalt head coach Carl Frerichs said. “The defense really played hard, and the offensive line played the best of all season.” Basalt’s scores came from Ian Lumsden, who had a pair of touchdown runs against the Roaring Fork. Quarterback Miles Levy passed to Kyle Roberts for Basalt’s other score. Frerichs said the Longhorns put forth a team effort in their best rushing attack of the season. Tight end Raul Torres and fullback Alex Alberto bolstered the up-front play of center Oswaldo Morales, guards Cullen White and Jake Reuss and tackles Thomas Wirth and Tita Ramos. They helped the Longhorns boost their record to 2-1 in the Western Slope League game. They are 3-4 overall. Next up? A showdown against Battle Mountain on Friday night at the BHS Stadium. Kickoff will be at 7 p.m. for the biggest game at Basalt in years. The Huskies are coming off a 54-6 domination of Aspen on Friday night in Edwards. Battle Mountain and Basalt are tied with matching 2-1 conference records. The Huskies from the Vail area are 3-3 overall after the ski-town win over Aspen (0-3 in league, 2-5 overall). Battle Mountain will move back up to Class 3A football next season. But this year the Huskies are competing for a playoff spot in 2A. Battle Mountain will send running backs Noah Shamus, Wyatt Harwood, Chance Archuleta and quarterback Demetrius Parrish against the Longhorns in Basalt on Friday night. The Huskies also feature strong-legged kicker Chase Keep. Moffat County is leading the Western Slope North League with a 3-0 conference mark. The Bulldogs are 5-2 overall. Moffat County stopped Basalt 38-7 a week ago. The Bulldogs topped Coal Ridge 39-12 on Friday night in New Castle. The Longhorns, after this week’s home game against Battle Mountain, will travel to Aspen for the regular-season finale on Halloween. Roaring Fork and Coal Ridge both are 1-2 in league play and 3-4 overall. Aspen, after the road loss to Battle Mountain, will hit the road again this week for the long trip to Craig. The Aspen-Moffat County game is set for 7 p.m. Friday in Craig. The Skiers, going through a transition with a new head coach halfway through the season, fell behind early against Battle Mountain. By halftime, the explosive Huskies had generated a 40-0 lead. The Skiers avoided the shutout when Jesse Lopez scored on a 3-yard run in the fourth quarter of the Western Slope League game. For Aspen, it was the second game under interim head coach Chris Peshek, a longtime AHS football assistant. Former head coach Ryan Triece resigned last week. He had been suspended for unsportsmanlike conduct in Aspen’s loss two weeks ago against Roaring Fork.
