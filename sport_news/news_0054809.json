How does he explain that? Whether it is using his personal email account, wearing non-descript clothing to an in-person meeting with the teacher to avoid recognition, or allegedly saying “This conversation never happened” and ignoring the advice of an academic support member, Flood’s actions are not in concert with naivety.\nWhen his actions were first reported, Flood quickly went on the attack , defending his integrity.\nAfter his suspension, Flood said in a statement that “I take full responsibility and accept the consequences of my actions,” but he stopped short of an apology or acknowledging wrongdoing.\nAfter all, Flood was told multiple times in private that the player would be academically ineligible, but his public words and his private actions showed a refusal to accept the decision as final .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:07:42.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
