The fifth-place finisher Saturday in the District 2-3A meet, held at Northwest Florida State College, was the Eagles' No. 4 runner. While fans watched Niceville dominate from the finish line, the senior saw it from just a few steps behind. If he was to finish behind four other runners, at least three were his teammates. \"It makes racing so much fun,\" Thompson said. \"When you get out in a race, we're so tight.\" Niceville dominated the boys race -- just minutes after winning the girls race -- and added a district title sweep to an already-impressive season. Fort Walton Beach finished runner-up and Crestview placed third in both races, qualifying both for the Region 1-3A meet. Choctaw qualified Noah Lleva (10th, 18:55) and Mathew Roehrig (11th, 18:57) as both finished in the top 15. Navarre qualified Austin Epstein (sixth, 18:41) and Joshua Tilton (15th, 19:26). Jason Nodjomian finished second in 18 minutes, 9 seconds. Jared Herzog, Elijah Schneidewind, Thompson and Jack Johnson gave the Eagles five of the top-nine finishers and 23 points. \"You're coming down that final chute, and all you see is Niceville,\" Thompson said. \"That's awesome.\" In the girls race, Niceville's Hannah Schneidewind made up around 15 seconds in the second half on Fort Walton Beach senior Maddie Fulmer to claim the individual title. \"I know I normally have a better second half than first half,\" said Schneidewind, a sophomore. \"When I got to about 1,000 meters left, I thought of it like 500 meters and went for it.\" Following Schneidewind (20:46) was Vikings runner Brooke Crane (20:51) and Fulmer (20:54). Niceville's Claudia Howes (fourth, 20:56) and Fort Walton Beach's Emma Rudman (fifth, 21:00) rounded out the top five. \"It's a good day at the Schneidewind household,\" Niceville coach Jamie LaFollette said. All three Choctaw runners -- Shelby Lindsay (sixth, 21:18), Jula Davis (12th, 22:09) and Shawna Lindsay (15th, 22:23) -- qualified for regionals. Navarre's Sophia Tucker (ninth, 22:06) also qualified. SCORING RUNNERS Niceville -- first, 23 points (qualified for regionals as a team) Jason Nodjomian -- second, 18:09", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:17:39.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
