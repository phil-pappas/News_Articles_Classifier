(AP) - Republican U.S. Sen. David Vitter blamed the state's financial problems on a \"broken and dysfunctional\" Baton Rouge, as he sought to distance himself from his three rivals in the governor's race in the latest TV debate.\nVitter's two GOP competitors, Public Service Commissioner Scott Angelle and Lt. Gov. Jay Dardenne, replied that the senator has helped to worsen the national debt and couldn't be trusted to fix Louisiana's problems.\nThursday's event at Louisiana Tech University - which was closed to the media and the public - was only Vitter's second appearance in five televised debates ahead of the Oct. 24 election.\nVitter, Angelle, Dardenne and Democratic state Rep. John Bel Edwards each talked of his plan to hold one or more special legislative sessions to address the state's budget woes.\n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
