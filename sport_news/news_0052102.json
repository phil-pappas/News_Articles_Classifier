It represents his strongest showing in California since early 2013. \nViews of Obama fall along partisan lines, and his approval rating in this Democratic state is far more positive than it is nationally. \nFrom the pollster: \n▪ “What’s noteworthy to me is that when you look at Obama’s job approval rating, he’s really actually done much better this year than he did last year.” \n▪ “Obama’s kind of getting close to the end of his tenure, and I think what he’s been doing policy-wise is much more appealing to California voters, particularly Democrats and people within his political base.” \n– Mark DiCamillo, director, The Field Poll \nFrom the field: \n▪ “The economy’s improving. That’s the most important factor, I think. The economy’s improving, more jobs are being developed.” \n– Julian Yerena Jr., a 37-year-old Democrat from Parlier \n▪ “He seems to be doing everything in his power to cripple us. I think he’s so worried about his own agenda that he’s not considering what is actually happening to the country around him.” \n– Anna Freeman, a 27-year-old from Modesto who said she previously was a Republican but is now an independent voter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:56:21.083+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
