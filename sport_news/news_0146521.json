Show Caption Previous Next \nCLEVELAND - The Dawg Pound faithful suffered another infuriating blow after the Cleveland Browns fell to the San Diego Chargers on a last-second field goal. \nTo make matters worse, Chargers' rookie kicker Josh Lambo missed the original kick, but the Browns were called for offsides so he got another opportunity to win the game in front of his home crowd. \nKeep up with all your Browns news this season with the FREE newsnet5 app: Apple | Android \nAdding salt to the wound, Phillip Rivers managed to defeat the Browns without three of his five starting offensive lineman and wide receivers Malcolm Floyd and Stevie Johnson (Floyd and Johnson injured were early in the game). \nAnd though Josh McCown put up good numbers (356 yards on 32 of 41 passing for two touchdowns), he tied the active NFL streak for most lost starts lost by a quarterback. He is currently tied at nine straight with former Browns' first-round pick Brandon Weeden, who takes the field for the Dallas Cowboys later Sunday evening. \nSo what do the Browns need to do to win next week against AFC North rival the Baltimore Ravens? \nSOUND OFF on Dawgs On The Run right here on newsnet5.com on Monday at 7:30 a.m. \nYou can call (216) 431-3820 or Skype DAWGSontherun to chat about the Browns with Andy Baskin and Mike Cairns. \nThe live stream can be watched HERE. \nFor the latest coverage of the Cleveland Browns, click here. \n---", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:19:43.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
