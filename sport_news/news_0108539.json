There's an image of an alligator.\nThere are more than 50 stickers in all.\n\"You talk like a local, not chat like one too,\" the developer's website proudly states.\nThe app was created by John Clark IV, Alyson Sage Kilday, of Hop & Jaunt, and Barrett Conrad, a web and software developer. It is available now in the iTunes store. The release coincides with NOLA Tech Week.\nThe app requires iOS 8.3 or later. It is compatible with the iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.\n:)\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
