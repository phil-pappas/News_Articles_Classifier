Coming off his first 100-yard rushing game with the Eagles, Murray is now tasked with keeping the production alive.\n\"I finally feel like myself,\" Murray said Thursday. \"Everyone is starting to settle down and get their legs underneath them.\"\nOn Sunday night, he'll play against a Carolina run defense that has kept opponents to 3.9 yards per carry, and star linebacker Luke Kuechly has been sidelined for three games. Kuechly is back in the lineup, and the combination of Kuechly and Thomas Davis form what Eagles coach Chip Kelly considers the best pair of linebackers the Eagles will face.\n\"Luke is one of the best linebackers in the NFL ... and his partner in crime, Thomas, has been great for a long time,\" Murray said. \"We'll have our hands full, but we're excited about the challenge.\"\nMurray rushed 21 times for 112 yards and one touchdown on Monday against the Giants. In his last two games, he has 41 carries for 195 yards and two touchdowns. It came after a slow start to the season.\n\"Collectively, we're playing well right now,\" Murray said. \"But it has a lot to do with how we prepare during the week. ... Everyone has looked in the mirror and we got better as a group.\"\n(c)2015 The Philadelphia Inquirer\nVisit The Philadelphia Inquirer at www.philly.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1742053&h=Murray+expects+test+from+Carolina+linebackers", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1742053&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1742053"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:23:34.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
