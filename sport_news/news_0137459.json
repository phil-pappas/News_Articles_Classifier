According to the airline, the ongoing problem caused more than 450 flights to be delayed.\nAs of 7 p.m., nine of Sunday's 15 remaining Southwest flights inbound or outbound from Portland International Airport were delayed. Two arrivals were pushed back by more than an hour.\nAfter a 2014 collapse , Southwest's overall on-time performance has improved, ranking first among all airlines in September with 87.5 percent of flights arriving or departing on time.\nA Portland of Portland spokesperson referred inquiries to Southwest Airlines. The Dallas-based company did not immediately return a call for comment.\nIn a statement , Southwest asked passengers traveling Sunday or Monday to arrive at least two hours early for departures, print out boarding passes in advance and use airport kiosks to print passes and luggage tags.\n-- Michael Russell Follow @tdmrussell", "external_links": ["http://www.bizjournals.com/chicago/news/2015/10/07/southwest-airlines-has-arrived-carrier-makes-a.html", "https://twitter.com/tdmrussell", "http://www.swamedia.com/releases/technology-challenges-affecting-online-and-airport-customer-servicing?l=en-US", "http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-southwest-air-20141014-column.html"], "published": "2015-10-12T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:36:35.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
