It’s about as even as it gets, at least on paper. But as we know, paper is meaningless. It’s what happens on the field that matters and there is no shortage of talking points for Saturday’s 1 p.m. Finger Lakes West showdown between long-time football rivals Red Jacket and Clyde-Savannah. Both come into the game 6-0. Both feature offenses averaging more than five touchdowns a game and both have defensive units that give up no more than two per game. Both have played the exact same opponents this season and both have won all six of their games by an average margin of 27 points. So, naturally, the only thing left to do is play the game. For the Indians, it’s been all about a team that’s reloaded quite nicely despite graduating close to 20 players from last year’s squad. Senior Sean Sheets is the unquestioned heart and soul of a running game that’s been punishing and effective. Dan Colasurdo and Keith Rizzo are fellow seniors that change the pace of the running attack, and senior quarterback Thomas Palmeri has used his accurate arm to keep the offense balanced. At Clyde-Savannah, running back Tyler Rattray is the focal point of an offense that moves the ball well on the ground. RB Jarrod Faniel and quarterback Nathan Paddock offer suitable alternatives as well and will test a Red Jacket defense that will probably play an entire game after not seeing much action in the second half of recent lopsided victories. As dynamic as both teams can be at moving and scoring, it’s no secret that defense will determine Saturday’s winner. The Red Jacket defensive front will be working against a Clyde-Savannah offensive line that has a considerable size advantage, but while size can help, it doesn't necessarily clinch anything. \"We might be a little bit bigger up front but Red Jacket has been and continues to be very aggressive,\" said C-S coach Nick DerCola. \"I tell the kids games like this usually come down to three or four plays, and you never know when that's going to happen.\" In other words, don't take any plays off. Form, technique and fundamentals are paramount when the margin for error is this slim and as much as offensive fireworks can provide points, it's more important to stop the points from being scored. It’s about as good as it gets with high school football. Two undefeated rivals working against each other to claim the league title while also keeping their focus on the ultimate goal of winning a Section V title. Mynderse (0-6) at Marcus Whitman (0-6), 7 p.m. Friday: One of these teams will end its regular season with its first win of the season and the factor favoring Whitman is a Mynderse defense that’s allowing an average of 36 points a game. Of course, Whitman is giving up 30 and neither offense is scoring more than 13 per game. Mynderse has a capable offense with Scott Kline at RB; he ran for 166 yards and two TDs in last weekend’s loss to Red Jacket. Sophomore QB Eli Prosser is a running weapon out of the backfield as well. The duo has scored 10 of the team’s 11 rushing TDs, so the Wildcats are aware of whom to watch. Whitman, meanwhile, counters with a ground game led by Jake Hill and Tyler Cummings. The Wildcats should be able to run effectively in this matchup but who wins this game will likely come down to defense. Senior Gavin McCumiskey has been a defensive leader with his work in the trenches and if the Wildcats want to end 2015 on a positive note, they’ll need him to rise again. Key: Stop the run, stop the losing streak. That approach should work for either team so whoever gets the better effort up front should emerge the victor. Gates Chili (3-3) at Victor (6-0), 7 p.m. Friday: The Blue Devils gave up 34 points in last week’s win over unbeaten Hilton after giving up 43 in the first five games combined. In Gates Chili, the Blue Devils will find a team that also knows how to score, having scored 40 or more points in four of its last five. The problem for the Spartans is a defense that’s giving up 30 per. Gates Chili has a potent threat in Anthony Stallworth and varsity newcomer Jaquan Gilbert, a sophomore RB who can scoot. The balanced Victor offense will look to take advantage of a Gates Chili defense that’s heading in the wrong direction. After holding each of their first four opponents to 15 points or less, the Spartans have allowed 32 and 33 in their last two, but managed to win both shootout games. How that will work against a Victor offense that’s averaging 36 points is the key for this game. The running attack continues to be strong with Dan Barrow (605 yards), QB Jamie Trimboli (394) and T.D. Ierlan (382) leading the way for an offense that’s averaging 317 rushing yards per game. Key: Victor’s balance on offense is enough to keep the Gates Chili defense honest. Palmyra-Macedon (1-5) at Wayne (0-6), 7 p.m. Friday: Despite a five-game slide, Palmyra-Macedon remains in control of the No. 8 seed and final Class B Tournament slot. Pal-Mac and Waterloo are tied at No. 8 heading into this weekend, but the Red Raiders are ahead on second-level points. Brandon Hawkins has been in all-out beast mode, rushing for 284 yards and catching two passes for 64 yards in Pal-Mac’s heartbreaking loss to Newark last week. There’s no question Pal-Mac will need everything they can get from Hawkins, but how much they get depends on how he feels after missing the final play of last week’s game. He left the field injured, but early reports is that cramps kept him off the field for that play. The Red Raiders are facing an Eagles defense that’s allowing an eye-popping 45 points per game and has surrendered 50 or more points in three of its last four games. As for Pal-Mac’s defense, it has struggled as well but did well to contain a potent Newark team last weekend. But this weekend, the Red Raiders are going against a Wayne team that, after scoring 43 points in its first two games, has scored just 41 in its last four. Key: Run, run, run. Hawkins and the Red Raiders can snap their skid with a solid game to take advantage of a Wayne team that’s struggled against the run. Irondequoit (3-3) at Canandaigua Academy (5-1), 2 p.m. Saturday: The Braves aren’t in position to overtake Brockport for the No. 1 seed in Class A, but they are in position to avenge last year’s Class A Tournament loss to the Eagles. Senior Coron Broomfield cleared the 1,000-yard plateau last week with his 178 rushing yards in the win over Spencerport. But the Braves also unleashed the arm of senior QB Mitch Schaefer, who passed for a season-best 253 yards and three TDs. The 28 points allowed to the Rangers was the most since Week 3’s loss to Brockport but CA should be able to get the unit back on track against an Irondequoit offense that’s scoring nearly 18 points a game. Christopher DiCesare gives the Eagles a big threat out of the backfield; the shifty senior rushed for 206 yards and two TDs in last week’s win over Greece Athena. Still, the Eagles have struggled to score as of late, scoring no more than two touchdowns in each of their last four games. Key: Quick start. CA needs to establish itself on defense off the hop and not let Irondequoit establish any momentum. Midlakes (2-4) at Dundee (3-3), 1 p.m. Saturday: Midlakes it an offensive lowpoint in last week’s loss to South Seneca, essentially getting shut out after scoring just two points via safety. It’s a shame, too, because it wasted a solid outing by a defensive unit that held South Seneca to just one TD. Still, the Screaming Eagles appear headed to the postseason as a No. 7 seed in Class B, but they’d really like to do it with the right kind of momentum after losing their last two games. Midlakes has been a bit inconsistent on offense, but it has solid threats with sophomore RB Bryce Burri and QB Adam Baghi. RB Robert Middlebrook and Sean Tillman also are capable backs and if nothing else, Midlakes has to be encouraged with the experience that all these underclassmen are getting this season. Key: Ground game. Midlakes needs to get its ground game back on track to solve a Dundee defense that’s held each of its last two opponents to six points.
