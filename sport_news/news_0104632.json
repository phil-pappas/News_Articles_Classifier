Vigouroux failed to clear a backpass, instead allowing Angol the opportunity to tap home into an unguarded net from less than a yard out.Swindon found a lifeline with 16 minutes remaining, as Michael Bostwick headed Anton Rodgers' free-kick into his own net, but the hosts failed to find an equaliser and are still without a home win since the opening day of the season.
