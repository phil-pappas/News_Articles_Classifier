Their last win there was 33-30 in overtime Nov. 18, 2007. The game appeared to have ended when Phil Dawson’s 51-yard field goal banked off the left upright and ricocheted out short of the crossbar. Players left the field thinking it was over, but officials huddled and determined that Dawson’s kick actually hit the stanchion (support behind the crossbar) before coming back out. The initial ruling was reversed, and the Browns won on Dawson’s overtime field goal. The turnabout gave them a 6-4 record that led to a 10-6 finish. AFC NORTH WATCH The Browns have games against the Ravens, Broncos, Rams and Cardinals before getting their first crack at Cincinnati. The standings have the Bengals at 4-0, the Steelers at 2-2 and the Browns and Ravens at 1-3. “The Bengals will be hard to catch,” left tackle Joe Thomas said. “They have a really good team.” The Bengals will face the Seahawks and Bills before their bye week, then come back with a game at Pittsburgh prior to taking on the Browns on Nov. 5 in Cincinnati. HALF AND HALF Josh McCown’s first halves vs. his second halves in his two full games as the Browns’ starting quarterback: • Oct. 4 at San Diego First half: 19-of-26, 212 yards, TD, no picks, three sacks, score 13-13 Second half: 13-of-15, 144 yards, TD, no picks, Browns outscored 17-14. • Sept. 27 vs. Oakland First half: 7-of-15, 104 yards, no TDs, no picks, one sack, outscored 17-3. Second half: 21-of-34, 237 yards, two TDs, one pick, four sacks, Raiders outscored 17-10. WIDEOUT WATCH • Five-foot-7 Andrew Hawkins came up big against the Ravens with seven catches for 87 yards in a 23-21 loss last Sept. 21. In the season-ending rematch at Baltimore, Hawkins wasn’t nearly as productive, but quarterback Connor Shaw was playing his first NFL game. • No team game plans for Baltimore’s Marlon Brown, who has just 330 receiving yards since the start of the 2014 season. The Browns have an eye on the 6-foot-5 wideout, though. An undrafted rookie out of Georgia in 2013, Brown caught three touchdown passes against them as a rookie. WEST WENT OFF Figures for Browns running backs in last year’s Baltimore games: • Terrance West: 12 carries, 36 yards, TD in Cleveland; 18 carries, 94 yards, TD at Baltimore. • Isaiah Crowell: 11 carries, 55 yards, TD in Cleveland; four carries, 6 yards at Baltimore. Since getting traded to the Titans in September, West has 16 carries for 51 yards. Page 2 of 5 - BELICHICK ON WEEDEN A game at Baltimore was the beginning of the end for Brandon Weeden’s Cleveland career. The 2012 first-round pick left Game 2 of the 2013 season with an injury, trailing the Ravens 14-6. By the time Weeden healed, head coach Rob Chudzinski had decided to stick with injury replacement Brian Hoyer. The tables have turned. Weeden is trying to revive his career as an injury replacement for Tony Romo. Weeden will duel New England’s Tom Brady at 4:25 p.m. Sunday. “Weeden has a lot of talent,” Patriots head coach Bill Belichick said. “He can make all the throws. “He uses his running back and outlet receivers well. It looks like they’ve put a lot of responsibilities on him with some audibles and run-pass checks. “You can see him making decisions at the line of scrimmage based on the defensive look. So, he’s obviously a pretty smart guy that has a good command of what they’re doing.” Weeden has lost two starts since replacing Romo, dropping his career record to 5-18. 300-1 AND HOLDING Odds against the Browns winning the Super Bowl held at 300-1 even after their loss at San Diego. The 49ers, whom the Browns play in December, also are at 300-1. Only Tampa Bay (400-1) and Jacksonville (500-1) are bigger longshots. Odds for other AFC North teams are 15-1 for Cincinnati, 40-1 for Pittsburgh and 40-1 for Baltimore. The shortest odds on other upcoming Browns foes are 7-1 for Seattle, 10-1 for Denver and 18-1 for Arizona. HADEN TO HARTLINE Based on national jersey sales tabulated by DICK’S, Browns fans entered the season starved for something to latch onto. Joe Haden’s No. 23 jersey is one of the league’s top sellers. Other Browns in the top 100 are Donte Whitner, 31st; Joe Thomas, 34th; Johnny Manziel, 45th; Isaiah Crowell, 91st, and Brian Hartline, 97th. DODGEBALL AT PITTSBURGH Pittsburgh kicker Josh Scobee missed fourth-quarter field goals of 49 and 41 yards that would have delivered a win over Baltimore two Thursdays ago. Scobee was not asked to attempt a 50-yarder that would have won the game in overtime. The Ravens got the ball back and ended it on a 52-yard Justin Tucker field goal. Would head coach John Harbaugh admit it was a lucky win? “No,” he said. OUT OF THE INNER HARBOR Browns left tackle Joe Thomas says it will be different facing Baltimore “without a lot of their familiar faces, most notably Haloti Ngata and Terrell Suggs.” Page 3 of 5 - The Ravens got lots of mileage out of Ngata after the infamous 2006 draft move in which they traded down from No. 12 overall to No. 13. With the 12th pick, Cleveland took Kamerion Wimbley, who became a serviceable defender. At 13, the Ravens grabbed Ngata, who stands a good chance of making the Hall of Fame. After nine years with the Ravens, Ngata was traded to Detroit. His six-year contract, which calls for $37.1 million in guaranteed money, isn’t bad for a guy going on 32. All of Suggs’ 106.5 career sacks (16 against Cleveland) have come with Baltimore, including 12 last year. He is on injured reserve. He will turn 33 Sunday. The front seven is further depleted because defensive end Chris Canty won’t play due to a calf injury. ‘WAVE OF ZOMBIES’ The Ravens thought so much of a Bleacher Report “compliment” that they posted it in their weekly press release: “Like wave upon wave of zombies bearing down on their foes, the Ravens always have a next man up ready.” The Ravens also are 1-3 and will be over a zombie cliff if the Browns beat them. Among key men Baltimore has been playing without are first-round pick/WR Breshad Perriman (knee), safety Matt Elam (injured reserve) and left tackle Eugene Monroe (concussion). Tight end Dennis Pitta (hip) isn’t yet eligible to come off the PUP list. Wideout Steve Smith (back) and tight end Crockett Gillmore (calf) both got hurt at Pittsburgh and won’t face the Browns. Wideout Michael Campanaro, who scored a touchdown at Pittsburgh, left the game with a back injury and was placed on injured reserve. As to the wave of replacements, quarterback Joe Flacco said, “I assume everybody is ready to go and fired up. This is the opportunity of a lifetime.” Harbaugh is digging in: “We believe we can overcome any adversity. We have before. We will again.” • Monroe is due back at left tackle. He is part of an offensive line Mike Pettine calls the best the Browns have faced to date. FLACCO AND FORSETT • With Smith (373 receiving yards, No. 9 in the league) out of the mix today, quarterback Joe Flacco will rely on No. 29, running back Justin Forsett. Forsett, who turns 30 on Wednesday, ran for 150 yards and was a workhorse down the stretch in the recent win at Pittsburgh. In a 2014 season finale against the Browns, he ran 17 times for 119 yards. • Flacco’s 13-1 record against Cleveland includes a good-but-not-great 92.0 passer rating. He has benefitted from strong defenses. The team’s assorted 2015 issues help explain his current passer rating of 80.5. Page 4 of 5 - • Josh McCown’s best career stretch came in 2013 as an injury replacement to Jay Cutler in Chicago, when he posted five games with passer ratings above 100.0. Flacco’s best stretch was earlier in 2013 in the playoffs. His passer ratings were 125.6 in the first round (vs. Andrew Luck), 116.2 in the second round (vs. Peyton Manning), 106.2 in the AFC finals (vs. Tom Brady) and 124.2 in he Super Bowl (vs. Colin Kaepernick). • Wideout Kamar Aiken, undrafted in 2013, is the Ravens’ top healthy receiver with 11 catches for 165 yards. FACES ON RAVENS DEFENSE • The Ravens brought 34-year-old pass rusher Jason Babin off the scrap heap Sept. 16. The Jets cut him Sept. 5. Babin, a first-round pick in 2004, made his last notable play as a Jaguar in 2013 when he inadvertently tore out a handful of Andre Ellington’s dreadlocks while defending a run against Arizona. He had 18 sacks as an Eagle in 2011. He wears No. 56. • No. 58, 31-year-old Elvis Dumervil, has two of the Ravens’ 11 sacks. Ten of his 92 career sacks have come against the Browns. Dumervil is easy to spot because he is more than half a foot shorter than Browns left tackle Joe Thomas. • No. 51, 33-year-old inside linebacker Daryl Smith, has played nine games against the Browns. In six games against Cleveland since jumping to Baltimore as a free agent in 2013, he has four sacks. • No. 57, 2014 first-round pick C.J. Mosley, joins Smith to give Baltimore perhaps the best inside linebacker tandem the Browns will face. EXTRA POINTS • The Browns are in a stretch in which five of seven games are on the road. They finish with four of their last six games at home. • Harbaugh was hired away from Philadelphia, where he has mostly been special teams coordinator, in 2008. Pettine, who had worked as a defensive coach for Brian Billick from 2002-07, stayed on for one year. • Cornerback Jimmy Smith, a Round 1 pick in 2011, worked his way back from a foot injury that knocked him out of the second half of 2014. • Five of the Ravens’ first seven games will have been on the road. • Travis Benjamin in nine quarters with Josh McCown: 10 catches, 124 yards, TD Benjamin in seven quarters with Johnny Manziel: six catches, 204 yards, three TDs. • Harbaugh on Benjamin: “He’s a speed guy who has hurt us in the past. It’s not just him. The Browns are a very fast, explosive offense.” • As recently as 2008, new Dolphins head coach Dan Campbell was playing in the Great Lakes Classic against the Browns. Campbell was a Texas A&M tight end drafted in 1999, the year the expansion Browns picked Tim Couch at No. 1 overall. Page 5 of 5 - He was picked by the Giants in the third round, shortly after the Chargers picked tight end Steve Heiden.
