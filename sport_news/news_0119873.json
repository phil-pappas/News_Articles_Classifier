And Tim Irvin as well.\"\nWilliams has recorded 19 tackles this season (five solo) and had a career-high 10 takedowns against LSU. Irvin has 12 tackles (four solo) with two pass deflections.\nMeanwhile, cornerback T.J. Davis' status is less clear. The junior tore his ACL this spring and underwent surgery in March. He dressed for the San Jose State and participated in pregame warm-ups, but did not play against the Spartans.\n\"He's got to get to that confidence standpoint of going out there and cutting it loose in live contact and we're not totally there yet,\" Muschamp said. \"He's moving around well, been very pleased with obviously where he is. It's been a very quick recovery and we just got to work through the confidence levels, making sure he feels comfortable going out and cutting on it.\"\nMuschamp had no update when asked about injured defensive end/Buck Carl Lawson, who went down in the first half against Louisville.\nAuburn is a slight favorite over Kentucky for Thursday's game at 6:30 p.m.\nAuburn defensive coordinator Will Muschamp: Oct. 11, 2015 Auburn defensive coordinator Will Muschamp talks with the media after practice Sunday, Oct. 11, 2015, in Auburn, Ala.
