(AP) - All around him, Jay Cutler sees teammates going down. \nThere is at least some positive news on the injury front for the Chicago Bears. Their quarterback is healing. \nCutler said the strained hamstring that kept him out two weeks ago is improving even if it's not quite 100 percent heading into Sunday's game at Kansas City. \nThe Bears (1-3) have been racking up injuries at a rapid rate, particularly on offense. \nTop receiver Alshon Jeffery has been sidelined since the opener by a hamstring problem, and Eddie Royal has an ankle injury. \nCutler missed a shutout loss at Seattle two weeks ago. He looked sharp in his return, helping the Bears beat Oakland for their first win under new coach John Fox. But a dinged-up offensive line took another big hit with the loss of center Will Montgomery to a season-ending injury. \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T01:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:52:14.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
