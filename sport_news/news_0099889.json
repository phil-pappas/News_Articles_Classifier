Since then, she's been a chart icon, a fearless provocateur, a fashion inspiration and much more than we can squeeze into one article, much less her Gucci stage boots. Before the singer makes her return to Portland at the Moda Center on Saturday, here's a very condensed run-down on her last 30 years.\n1. \"Crazy for You\" goes No. 1\nOn May 11, 1985, Madonna topped the charts for a second time with \"Crazy For You.\" \"Material Girl\" had peaked at No. 2, following her first No. 1, \"Like a Virgin.\" Madonna was busy touring Florida—and just days earlier, Mr. and Mrs. Greenwald welcomed a bouncing baby future Oregonian music critic in sunny Santa Monica, California.\n2. Marriage to (and divorce from) Sean Penn\nMadonna's relationship with the actor produced one film (\"Shanghai Surprise\") and ended in 1989, after four years of marriage.\n3. \"Like a Prayer\" courts controversy\nThe video, thanks to an interracial kiss and its star doing choreography amid burning crosses, earned the ire of the Vatican—but the song hit No. 1.\n4. \"Vogue\" busts a move\n\"Vogue\" didn't kick off a dance craze, but the single—another No. 1—brought its extravagant poses from the Harlem LGBT scene to the mainstream.\n5. \"The Immaculate Collection\" comes early\nMadonna's first greatest hits collection came out in 1990: 25 years ago. Clearly, she wasn't done.\n6. Maverick Records launches\nSolidifying her position as a business, man, Madonna launched her own entertainment company as part of a reported $60 million deal with Time Warner.\n7. The \"Sex\" book\nA bestseller on a different chart, Madonna continued defying Bush-era prudes with an coffee table collection including erotic imagery, writing and her then-lover, Vanilla Ice.\n8. \"Take a Bow,\" Madge\nThe 1995 single reached Madonna's familiar place at the top of the Billboard Hot 100, but this one stayed there for seven weeks: making it her biggest hit, at least so far.\n9. Madonna, meet \"Evita\"\nMadonna's star turn in the 1996 title role made for one of her better-received films: she won a Best Actress Golden Globe, and her performance of \"You Must Love Me\" earned writers Tim Rice Andrew Lloyd Webber the Best Original Song Oscar.\n10. The power of production\nElectronic producer William Orbit became Madonna's new guru on 1998 album \"Ray of Light,\" a hit collection that found her ahead of the genre's mainstream curve.\n11. Marriage to (and divorce from) Guy Ritchie\nMadonna starred in one Ritchie film, \"Swept Away,\" and the two welcomed son Rocco before parting ways in 2008. The singer has four children in all, including Lourdes, David and Mercy.\n12. Bond, James Bond\nMadonna's UK years included a shot at a James Bond theme, this time for 2002's \"Die Another Day.\"\n13. That MTV kiss\nProving the Video Music Awards were still her playground, Madonna's performance of 2003 track \"Hollywood\" at the MTV broadcast climaxed when she shared a kiss with \"TRL\" golden girl Britney Spears. Oh, and another with Christina Aguilera. Spears' \"Me Against the Music,\" a collaboration with Madonna, was a dance hit, though it fizzled in the middle of the Hot 100.\n14. Countdown to \"4 Minutes\"\nTurns out Madonna had more heat with Spears ex Justin Timberlake: he and producer Timbaland joined her for 2008 single \"4 Minutes,\" which made it to No. 3.\n15. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\nMadonna was the only woman inducted into the canonical boys' club in 2008, with a presentation by Timberlake that included a story about an awkward B-12 shot .\n16. Queen of the Super Bowl\nMadonna took over the game's halftime show in 2012, with Nicki Minaj and M.I.A. in tow. The performance set a Super Bowl ratings record , topping the game itself.\n17. Co-signing Drake\nUsually the young MC aims his spotlight toward new artists, but for his headlining debut at Coachella in 2015, Drake brought out Madonna—who gave him an on-stage kiss that seemed like more than the rapper had rehearsed. It's Madonna, Drizzy: expect everything.\nMadonna, Moda Center, Oct. 17, 8 p.m. Tickets: $40-$355 .\n-- David Greenwald\ndgreenwald@oregonian.com\n503-294-7625; @davidegreenwald", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/davidegreenwald", "http://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/20/arts/madonna-makes-a-60-million-deal.html", "http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20183375,00.html", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/super-bowl-draws-record-1113-million-viewers/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/a4tD8dy9Reg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/GuJQSAiODqI", "http://www.rosequarter.com/events/detail/madonna"], "published": "2015-10-13T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:05:04.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
