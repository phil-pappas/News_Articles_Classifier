It made him the winningest quarterback in team history with 102.\nNew York (3-2) has won three straight and leads the NFC East. San Francisco (1-4) has lost four in a row.\nCarlos Hyde's 2-yard run with 1:45 remaining gave the 49ers the lead. But on a night of huge plays and lengthy drives, Manning had the topper.\nBENGALS 27, SEAHAWKS 24, OT \nCINCINNATI — Andy Dalton led the Bengals from a 17-point fourth-quarter deficit to a 27-24 overtime victory on Sunday over the Seattle Seahawks, keeping Cincinnati undefeated with the second-biggest comeback in its history.\nTrailing 24-7 as the fourth quarter started, Dalton threw for a touchdown, ran for another and led the Bengals on a 69-yard drive without a timeout. Mike Nugent tied it with a 31-yard field goal on the final play of regulation.\nNugent was good again from 42 yards with 3:36 left in overtime, the ball deflecting off the left upright before going through. It matched the second-biggest comeback in Cincinnati's history when trailing in the fourth quarter.\nThe Bengals are 5-0 for the first time since 1988, the last time they went to the Super Bowl.\nSeattle (2-3) punted twice in overtime, giving the Bengals a chance to pull it out.\nFALCONS 25, REDSKINS 19, OT \nATLANTA — Robert Alford returned an interception 59 yards for a touchdown, keeping the Falcons unbeaten.\nThe Redskins had the first possession of OT, and Kirk Cousins moved the team to midfield. When wide receiver Ryan Grant slipped on a pass route, Alford caught Cousins' pass and was left with open field down the Falcons' sideline for the touchdown.\nDevonta Freeman's apparent 13-yard TD catch in the final minute of regulation was ruled incomplete on a review. Freeman scored on 6-yard run two plays later to give Atlanta a 19-16 lead. Dustin Hopkins' 52-yard field goal on the final play of regulation forced overtime.\nThe Falcons (5-0) overcame two interceptions and a lost fumble by Matt Ryan. Freeman had 27 carries for 153 yards and the touchdown.\nThe Redskins (2-3) were denied their attempt for their first back-to-back wins in almost a year — since Weeks 7 and 8 in 2014.\nBROWNS 33, RAVENS 30, OT \nBALTIMORE — Travis Coons kicked a 32-yard field goal in overtime and Josh McCown threw for a team-record 457 yards.\nCleveland (2-3) had lost 13 of the previous 14 meetings between these AFC North foes, but in this one the Browns rallied from a 12-point deficit to leave the Ravens (1-4) alone in the division cellar.\nPlaying its second straight overtime game, Baltimore went three-and-out on the first possession of the extra session. McCown then used more than seven minutes to move the Browns 51 yards before Coons kicked his fourth field goal with 6:43 left in OT.\nMcCown completed 36 of 51 passes with two touchdowns in becoming the first quarterback in Browns history with three straight 300-yard games. He broke the team record of 444 yards passing set by Brian Sipe on Oct. 25, 1981, against the Baltimore Colts.\nJoe Flacco ran for two 1-yard touchdowns and threw for a score, but fell to 13-2 against Cleveland.\nPACKERS 24, RAMS 10", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:57:37.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
