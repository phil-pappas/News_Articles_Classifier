At 5 feet seven inches, he isn't very tall. He doesn't believe in sledging the batsmen either. But give Ayyappa a cricket ball and he can be fast and furious, as he showed while taking six for 71 to earn Andhra their first ever Ranji Trophy first innings lead against Mumbai in their opening clash of the season here. Ayyappa used the bouncer to deadly effect, as the Mumbai batsmen fell in the trap of hooking or pulling him to fielders in the deep. \"I bowled short, since it was difficult to judge which balls to play, and which to leave, because of the uncertain bounce. It was difficult to judge the bounce of the ball on this wicket,\" the 23year-old told TOI on Sunday.\nAyyappa also credited his captain-Mohammad Kaif, for his career-best show. \"He has encouraged me a lot. At this stage, you won't find many captains who would encourage you to bowl bouncers,\" he said.\nWith the tussle for the first innings lead getting tense by the minute, Ayyappa knew even a fifer wouldn't be enough unless the last Mumbai man was removed. \"I thought that the five wickets that I got won't be of any use if I didn't get the sixth one,\" he said. His favourite wicket, amongst the six that he took in Mumbai's first innings, was Suryakumar Yadav's.\nThe youngster, who comes from the remote district of Razole, which is 350 kilometres off Vizag, has made it at this level despite belonging to a poor family. \"My father would iron clothes. He didn't know about cricket, but he wanted me to be a cricketer.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-05T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:12:40.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
