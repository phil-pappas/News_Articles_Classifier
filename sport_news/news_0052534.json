He didn't term it a retirement. \"Who knows what will come in the future?\" said Spurrier, 70. \nFormer Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said his longtime rival, Steve Spurrier, might feel something special in the immediate aftermath of his leaving the profession. \n“All that pressure will be lifted off his shoulders,” Bowden said when reached for his reaction on Spurrier’s retirement. “The pressure in this job keeps growing more and more ... especially with all this Twitter and Facebook and all the different ways people can talk about you now. At least Steve didn’t hang around as long as that old guy [Bowden] up north.” \nSpurrier, 70, made the formal announcement during a news conference in Columbia, S.C., on Tuesday. He was in his 31st year of coaching, 23 of them in the SEC with the Florida Gators (1990-2001) and the Gamecocks (2005-15). \nSouth Carolina is 2-4 this season and 9-10, with a 3-9 SEC record, in the last two seasons. \nSpurrier refused to describe his decision as a “retirement.” \n“First of all, I’m resigning and not retiring,” he said. “I doubt if I’ll ever be a head coach again ... but don’t say I’ve retired completely. Who knows what will come in the future?” \nSpurrier, who lashed out earlier this season at media who called his age into question, said he is following through on a promise he made long ago. \n“My answer has always been the same ... If it starts going south, starts going bad, then I need to get out,” he said. “It’s time for me to get out of the way and give somebody else a go at it.” \nFor the rest of the season, that somebody else will be Shawn Elliott, South Carolina’s co-offensive coordinator and offensive line coach. Early speculation for the permanent job includes head coaches Tom Herman of Houston, Justin Fuente of Memphis and Rich Rodriguez of Arizona; and Alabama defensive coordinator Kirby Smart. WUERFFEL: SPURRIER CHANGED HIS LIFE \nCurrent Florida coach Jim McElwain, who had his first extensive conversation with Spurrier when they shared a flight over the summer for SEC Media Days, said it was time to savor Spurrier’s accomplishments, not dwell on his last 19 games at USC. \n“Let’s celebrate what this guy’s all about and what he’s done,” McElwain said in a statement. “Not only with this game of football but with the impact he’s had in so many young guys’ lives along the way. You talk to each and every one of them and he’s a guy they totally respect.” \nSpurrier, who won the Heisman Trophy in 1966 while playing for the Gators, became the first winner of that award to coach another one, Danny Wuerffel — who echoed McElwain in pointing out that Spurrier, as passionate as he was about winning, had more important priorities. \n“His impact on me changed the trajectory of my life,” Wuerffel said in a statement released through Desire Street Ministries, the charity he founded. \nFlorida athletic director Jeremy Foley said Spurrier won championships and produced All-Americans and NFL players while never taking shortcuts. \n“A guy who did it the right way,” Foley said in a statement. “A true winner and a class guy and we are proud to call him a Gator and I am proud to call him my friend.” OFFENSE SHAKES UP SEC \nSpurrier’s 131 conference victories are second only to Alabama coach Bear Bryant (159). Spurrier’s teams at Florida won six league titles and he was a six-time SEC coach of the year. \nSpurrier is the all-time leader in coach victories at both Florida and South Carolina. His total college coaching record is 228-89-2 (.717). \nHis innovative offense, dubbed the Fun ‘N’ Gun, stood the stodgy, toss-sweep SEC on its ear. It made use of multiple formations that resulted in a long line of speedy wide receivers being wide open for quarterbacks such as Wuerffel, Shane Matthews, Doug Johnson and Rex Grossman. \nFlorida’s record for points in a season before the Spurrier Era was 343 under Ray Graves in 1969. Spurrier’s first Florida team broke that record and went on to average 461 points per season through his final year in 2002. The Gators are the only college program in history to score 500 or more points in four consecutive seasons, from 1993 to 1996. \nThe national championship team of 1996 scored 611 points (47 per game), still tied for the school record with the 2008 national championship team — which played one more game. \nSpurrier’s teams scored 40 points or more in 61 victories — exactly half of his 122 wins at Florida. His teams had 25 50-point games, five of 60 points or more, three of 70 points or more and one 80-point game. \nThose video-game scores also weren’t all against nonconference weaklings, and not all in the loud confines of The Swamp. \nSpurrier’s teams scored 50 or more in Georgia’s Sanford Stadium (the only time in history the Bulldogs gave up 50 or more at home) and LSU’s Tiger Stadium. The Gators hung 63 on South Carolina in one game at Williams-Brice Stadium. DOMINATING THE ’DOGS \nSpurrier also had a knack for reversing the fortunes of rivalries. \nBefore he arrived at Florida in 1990, the Gators had gone 2-10 in the previous 12 years. In Spurrier’s 12 years as the UF coach, he went 11-1 against the Bulldogs and scored 40 or more points nine times. \nFlorida was 6-13 lifetime against Tennessee before 1990. The Gators began playing the Volunteers every season beginning the year Spurrier arrived, and he went 8-4. Spurrier’s 6-3 record against Alabama matched the total number of Gators victories over the Crimson Tide in the previous 71 years. \nWhen Spurrier went to South Carolina, the Gamecocks had lost 13 of 17 vs. Clemson. Spurrier went 6-4 against the Tigers, including five in a row. \nIn Spurrier’s first seven years at Florida, the Gators went 53-6 in SEC regular-season and championship games and lost only one conference home game. ‘AN SEC MAN’ \n“He was an SEC man all the way through,” said former Florida coach Doug Dickey. “He is a legend at Florida and in the SEC. You always hate to see anyone’s career come to an end who’s been so successful, but I’m sure Steve did what he feels is the best thing.” \nWhile Spurrier made his mark in the SEC, much of his career at Florida was defined by epic battles against Bowden. While Spurrier’s teams were 5-8-1 against the Seminoles, he won the one that counted the most, a 52-20 rout in the 1996 national championship game at the Sugar Bowl. \nIn the other 13 meetings, six were decided by a touchdown or less. \n“When you played Steve’s teams, you better be ready for a fight,” Bowden said. “I think he was the first guy who showed everyone that you could pass to win. Before, everyone felt they had to run the ball to win. Steve reversed that.” \nBowden said Spurrier has a standing offer to play golf. \n“I’m not in his league,” Bowden said. “The last time we played, he only wanted to give me four [strokes] a side. I’m going to need at least 10 a side against him.” \nGarry Smits: (904) 359-4362", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:23:21.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
