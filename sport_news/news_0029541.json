Comment Posted Oct. 5, 2015 at 4:54 PM By Stan Sulewski Posted Oct. 5, 2015 at 4:54 PM IONIA Ionia’s ‘Purple Week’ is a time in which community members can remember and honor those who have been affected by cancer, and provides an opportunity to raise funds to support those who are afflicted with the disease. This year’s Purple Week will be taking place Saturday, Oct. 3 through Friday, Oct. 9, and purple ribbons can be seen decorating the halls of the schools, yard signs line the streets, and Purple Week t-shirts are being worn with pride. There will be many events throughout the week in order to raise funds for cancer research and prevention, and one such event is the Purple Week Swim Meet, featuring the Ionia High School Girls Varsity Swim Team and the Ionia RAYS YMCA Swim Team. “We’ve never had the opportunity to participate in something like this,” said Paula Wood, coach of the Ionia RAYS. “My swimmers are really excited.” Amy Fuller, coach for the IHS Girls Varsity Swim Team, said that her swimmers were equally excited for the opportunity. “The girls are just really excited to give back to the community in honor of their loved ones who have been affected by cancer,” Fuller said. “Being able to participate in an event like this and give back to the cancer fund is really important for them.” The swim meet will be held Tuesday, Oct. 6 at 250 E. Tuttle Road in Ionia starting at 6 p.m. Wood says she hopes the event can become an annual tradition for the swim teams. According to Wood, the event is not an official swim meet, but more of an opportunity to raise money to support those affected by cancer. For $10, participants can sponsor one of the 17 events taking place at the swim meet, and swimmers can be sponsored for $20. Individuals who wish to sponsor the entire meet can do so for $150. All proceeds from the swim meet will go to the Purple Cancer Fund. “The events are different than a typical high school meet,” Fuller said. “There will be 17 events, and normally there are 12. It will be similar, but all the races will be shorter.” Before each event, event and swimmer sponsors will be acknowledged, as will the individual who the donation is honoring. Those who attend the swim meet will also have the chance to get in on the racing action. For just $1, individuals can challenge a member of the high school swim team to a race. According to Fuller, parents, friends, and other relatives are welcomed to participate, and can choose to donate more if they wish. There will be an opportunity for individuals to win a prize through a purple bead necklace toss, and event t-shirts will be given to those who are being honored at the swim meet.
