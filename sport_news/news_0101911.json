The game would come down to penalty strokes and the Indians came out on top allowing them to advance to the PCT semifinals. \nAs painful as the loss to Wayne Valley was the Lancers were determined not to let it affect the rest of their season. \n\"After the county loss we came together and we said that we would not let one loss define our season. We have stuck to that and it has become our motto,\" said Lakeland senior Daphne Leenas. \"We have come out with heart and we have been playing as a team.\" \nLakeland head coach Patty Kebrdle was happy to see how her team handled to loss. \n\"It was a rough loss but we had to move forward. I told the girls that they could not pack it in. Since then they have been playing very, very well,\" said Kebrdle. \nAll Lakeland has done since being eliminated from the PCT by Wayne Valley is go 6-1 in their last seven games with the lone loss coming at the hands of undefeated Ramsey. \n\"Ramsey is a very strong team. It was much harder to lose to West Milford (2-1) and Wayne Valley (strokes) then it was to lose to Ramsey, I can’t be too upset because Ramsey is a very good team. I was proud of them for the way they played,\" said Kebrdle. \nIncluded in the last half dozen wins for the Lancers was a 3-1 triumph over Wayne Hills and a 2-0 win over Pompton Lakes last Tuesday. \n\"Passaic County is really strong in field hockey this year. All six teams are pretty good,\" said Kebrdle. \nOn Friday night the Patriots, who were seeded first in the PCT knocked off second seeded Pompton Lakes 1-0 to win their third straight PCT. \n\"Being out of the county tournament early was a heartbreak but to win all these games feels great,\" said Leenas. \nIn the Lancers win over Pompton Lakes senior Alex Barna scored just seconds into the second half to give Lakeland a lead that they would not relinquish. \nTen minutes later Leenas scored off a Lakeland corner to give the Lancers some breathing room. \nJust prior to the Leenas goal the Cardinals had stepped up their offensive attack as they had five corners in under four minutes of play but each time the Lancers defense, led by goaltender Allison Cappello, was up to the challenge. \n\"Pompton Lakes was able to get corner after corner after corner but my defense was able to stay tough and keep clearing the ball,\" said Kebrdle. \"This was a good win against a tough team, they played like a team.\" \n\"Our defense and Ally have been stepping up so much and having that strong backbone is a great feeling on offense, knowing that if they get a corner we know our goalie is amazing and our defense is great so we know we have that support back there,\" Leenas added. \nKebrdle knows that even though her team has impressed in posting a 12-2-1 record through their first 15 games, that they have a tough road ahead of them in the state tournament. \n\"We are playing excellent right now,\" said Kebrdle. \"It will be hard being in North 1, Group 2 because there are teams likes Madison, West Essex and Ramsey but hopefully we will get a high enough seed to get a home game which would be very important.\" \nEmail: costelloj@northjersey.com © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:28:55.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
