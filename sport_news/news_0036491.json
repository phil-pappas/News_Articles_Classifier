Bob Condotta Seattle Times staff reporters \nSeahawks ullback Derrick Coleman will be released from the King County Jail on Friday and a court hearing has been cancelled, a spokesman for the King County Prosecutor’s Office said. \nColeman, who was arrested Wednesday night after authorities said the vehicle he was driving struck a car and he left the scene of the crash, had a court hearing set for Friday at 2:30 p.m. On Friday morning the King County Prosecutor’s Office said he will be released without charges filed. \n“You can only hold somebody for 72 hours under state law pending the charges, but the toxicology will take longer than that,” said Prosecutor’s Office spokesman Dan Donohoe. \n“It’s going to take several weeks. That’s not out of the ordinary,” Donohoe said..

He was being held without bond, as is common until he appears before a judge for a bail hearing. \nThe Seahawks have suspended Coleman indefinitely pending further information, a team spokesperson said in a statement Thursday. \nAccording to police, Coleman was driving a Dodge pickup eastbound in the 13600 block of Southeast 36th Street about 6:20 p.m. Wednesday when his vehicle struck a Honda Civic traveling in the same direction. \nMylett said Coleman’s car was traveling at “a high rate of speed” at the time of the accident. The speed limit on the road is 35 miles per hour, Mylett said. The driver of the other car, a male, sustained “serious but non-life-threatening injuries” and was taken to a hospital, Mylett said. Coleman did not report being injured. \nPolice said Coleman left on foot from the accident. Officers found him eight minutes after the accident standing barefoot two blocks from the scene, Mylett said, standing along the roadway on Southeast 37th Street. \nColeman was cooperative when officers contacted him, the chief said. \nAsked what led police to believe drugs or alcohol could be involved, Mylett said, “It’s going really toward statements that were made and observations from the officer at the scene. All I can say is there was enough to warrant us bringing the DRE (drug recognition expert) out there and do sobriety tests and also to secure a search warrant for his blood.” \nResults of the blood test, which was taken at Overlake Hospital, could take a few weeks, Mylett said. \nMylett said Coleman did not say why he left the scene of the accident. Mylett said that would be a focus of the investigation. \nColeman’s agents, Derrick Fox and Mark Bloom, released a statement, that read, in part: “While the facts of the case are still being determined, it seems Derrick may have fallen asleep while driving home from a Seahawks’ facility. … We will continue to work closely with the local officials while a full investigation is being conducted.” \nMylett said he could not comment about whether Coleman had fallen asleep. \nColeman’s lawyer, Bellevue-based Stephen W. Hayne, said he was confident charges will not be filed. Hayne released to television stations, as well as to the Seahawks, a roughly three-minute video Hayne took of him interviewing Coleman hours after the accident that Hayne says shows Coleman was not under the influence.
