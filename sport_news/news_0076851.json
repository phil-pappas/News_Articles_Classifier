If a game was not shown on NBA League Pass, Price was following it on the radio and online.\n“They’re probably sick of me texting them,” Price said of his Suns teammates. “Listening to the radio and listening to the games that weren’t televised and following the play-by-play on my computer, that sucks. It’s not fun. Being back in here is definitely better than being at home.”\nAZCENTRAL\nPhoenix Suns' Leuer fits in with shooting, rebounding\nPrice was not able to have any physical activity while trying to get through the “draining” experience that knocked him out. The 32-year-old had his first day of feeling better Thursday and first workout at Friday’s practice.\n“He tried to do whatever he could,” Suns coach Jeff Hornacek said. “You could tell he got winded. He’ll work his way back into it.”\nPrice’s absence came at an inopportune time when Eric Bledsoe also missed two games for illness, leaving Brandon Knight as the only point guard. Price hated the timing, too, because the 11th-year veteran uses exhibitions for improvement and correction.\n“Preseason is really good on mistakes that are rusty mistakes, floor-time mistakes,” Price said. “You try to build on that in the preseason so you eliminate some of those mistakes to start the season. I had my own personal strides and goals that I wanted to make and things I wanted to accomplish, feel-wise, on the floor before the regular season started. Not having those last couple preseason games was real frustrating but I would rather have what I had now, not in the middle of the season.”\nAZCENTRAL\nPhoenix Suns XTRA app: Get latest news, scores, photos\nFree throws\nSuns power forward Markieff Morris entered training camp with some conditioning catch-up to do but Hornacek said he appears regular-season ready now: “He’s been going almost two-a-days. He comes in early or late, shoots and gets that extra work in. He looks like he’s back to the shape he should be in.”\n* Hornacek on the Suns’ preseason league-leading 11.7 steals per game: “Our guys have been playing a little more physically so they’re going to have more opportunities to get steals. If you’re in the right position on your help defense, that’s going to help you get steals.”\n* With the Suns passing better in the preseason, Morris and backup power forwards Jon Leuer and Mirza Teletovic combined for 5.1 assists per game. Hornacek said, “A lot of the things we do, the 'four' has got to be able to make a play. With Mirza, Jon and obviously Markieff, they’re three guys who can pass the ball pretty good. The ball doesn’t have to stick because they know were to go with it.”\nReach Paul Coro at paul.coro@arizonarepublic.com or (602) 444-2470.
