Communities have until Dec. 27 to submit the necessary paperwork to opt out.\nWhile the above communities have prohibited the manufacture and sale of marijuana, home growing and possession of the drug are still allowed.\nIn other parts of Oregon, medical marijuana dispensaries planned to begin selling pot for recreational use Oct. 1.\nLawmakers passed legislation allowing temporary recreational sales because regular retail operations won't begin until sometime in 2016, after the OLCC establishes rules and issues licenses.\nPossession, cultivation and use of the drug has been legal in Oregon since July.\nFor more information on the state's recreational marijuana industry, go to marijuana.oregon.gov .\nCopyright 2015 KPTV-KPDX Broadcasting Corporation.
