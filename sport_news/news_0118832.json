They scored 23 first-quarter points on the way to a 44-2 victory over the Highwaymen to improve to 5-2. \nHills made sure Teaneck (0-6) would not harbor any thoughts of an upset, as they struck right out of the box. Luca Grave rumbled 26 yards to the Highwaymen 1-yard line and scored one play later. \nThe defense then took over, recording losses of 7, 2 and 3 yards on Teaneck’s first three offensive plays and on fourth down from the 8, the punt snap went out of the end zone for a safety. \nTwo plays after the Teaneck kickoff, Grave burst 35 yards up the middle for a touchdown, making it 16-0 just 4:05 into the game. \n“We wanted to come out and make a statement early and then work on some things,” WH coach Wayne Demikoff said. “We still have a lot of work to do, a lot of improvement to accomplish, and this was one step.” \nQuarterback Brendan DeVera made it 23-0 five minutes later when he found Vinny LoVerde for a 13-yard touchdown. It was the only completion in six first-half passes for DeVera, but Grave picked up his signal-caller. \nHe had 93 yards on eight first-half carries with three touchdowns, including a 3-yarder in the second quarter to make it 30-0, and finished with 153 yards on 12 runs and four scores. The last was an 8-yard run in the third quarter. \nIncredibly, Wayne Hills ran only 25 offensive plays the entire game, and their 163 yards of total offense belies the 44 points they scored. The final touchdown came at the end of the third quarter and began as a punt return. \nLoVerde fielded it at the Teaneck 45-yard line and went left. He lost the handle on the ball near the 30, but Tom Skiba alertly picked it up at the 32 and circled the left side and scored. \nTeaneck’s only points came seconds before the end of the first half when Wayne Hills was called for intentional grounding in the end zone. \nThe Wayne Hills defense recorded nine tackles for losses, with Joe Kenny registering 2½ of them along with 1½ sacks. Matt Varone had two of the five total Patriot sacks as Teaneck managed only 77 total yards. \nWayne Hills will face Paramus on Friday in their eighth and final game prior to the North 1 Group 4 cutoff. A win would all but clinch one of the eight spots. \n“We need to concentrate on Paramus right now,” Demikoff said. “All that other stuff will get figured out later. We want to be playing well going into the playoffs.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:11:13.637+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
