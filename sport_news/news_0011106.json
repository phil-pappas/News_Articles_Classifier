You're going to play games where you think you deserve better and I thought we deserved better tonight,\" said Ottawa coach Dave Cameron, who feels some struggling scorers on his team have to do a better job \"going to the dirty areas\" to score goals. \n\"We were just better all over the ice. We got out of our own end better, we got through the neutral zone better. I still think we passed up some good opportunities to get the puck to the net but it was good. It was a step in the right direction.\" \nNeal had a two-goal effort and both came on the power play -- including the winner with Kyle Turris in the box at 11:36 of the third. Only Mike Hoffman, with two goals, and Mark Stone were able to beat Hutton while Craig Smith also chipped in for the Predators. \nHoffman's second of the night with 3:32 remaining tied it up to send it to OT. He fired a blast from the point that Hutton never appeared to see. That came after Neal's second of the game had given the Predators the lead on the power play with Kyle Turris in the box at 11:36 left in the third. \n\"This one is definitely a tougher pill to swallow. I thought we played pretty well,\" said Stone. \"I think if we can play like that every night we're going to come out on the other end most nights. \n\"We just had a few minor mistakes that kind of cost us a couple of goals. They have a good power play. You're trying to defend (Shea) Weber as best you can and it opens up some tools. That's a good team. You can't take penalties.\" \nThe Senators were sailing along nicely and even outshot the Predators 26-16 through 40 minutes but were victimized by the tying goal late in the second. \nJust when it looked like the Senators were going to hold the lead heading to the third, Smith tied it up 2-2 following some play by the Senators in their own zone. Smith took a pass from Mike Ribiero after a turnover and beat Anderson upstairs from the slot with 2:03 left in the period. \nWhile the Senators had plenty of chances on Hutton, he stood his ground until Hoffman fired a blast that deflected off Ryan Ellis' stick and by him on the glove side at 7:13 of the second. It was a 60-footer and caught everybody off guard because you don't expect players to score from inside the blueline. \nThe Senators struck quickly to start the period. Only 15 seconds into the second, Stone took a pass from Kyle Turris down and low and beat Hutton upstairs on the stick side to tie it up 1-1. It was the 14th shot Hutton had faced as the Senators were doing a better job using their speed. \n\"The game was there for the taking for each team,\" said Hoffman. \"At the end of the day it was a shootout loss that could have gone either way.\" \nIt was the Predators who held the lead on the strength of Neal's effort on the power play at 9:49. Left alone in front, he was able to beat Anderson down low on the far side with blueliner Jared Cowen in the box. It's actually the first time in six games this season the Senators have behind after the first. \nThe Senators were also in a nasty mood. After nailing Smith with a nice open ice hit, Mark Borowiecki dropped the gloves with Paul Gaustad midway through the first. Then, a few minutes later, centre Zack Smith took on Barrett Jackman in a spirited battle. \nGiven the way the Senators have played lately they were trying to look at this as a moral victory in some ways. \n\"We got a point. We did a lot of things right that should have enabled us to win the game,\" said Anderson, who made 22 stops. \"Some nights you're going to play like that but not get the result you want. \n\"At the end of the day, we played well and we can build off that.\" \nThe Senators are off now until they host the New Jersey Devils Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:39:35.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
