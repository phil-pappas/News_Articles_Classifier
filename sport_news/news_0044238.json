Many anglers believe these smokers come into the bay to feast on the abundance of menhaden and white trout that show up this time of year. \nOne of the coolest things about targeting these kings is the fact that you can catch them by boat or from shore. They can be found throughout Pensacola Bay, but typically congregate around the Pensacola Bay Bridge, Port of Pensacola and around the turning basin at NAS Pensacola. \nWith that being said, land-locked anglers can go after them from the Pensacola Bay Fishing Bridge or off the seawall at Plaza de Luna Park. From shore you’ll just want to float a bait out using a balloon and wire leader with a treble hook. \nAnglers targeting them out of a boat typically either slow troll or anchor up and float baits out on the surface. The middle of the Pensacola Bay Bridge is a good place to start if you’ve never tried it before. \nLive bait is almost a must, but usually one or two throws with a cast net in Bayou Texar or Bayou Chico and you’ll have enough menhaden for a morning of fishing. \nMore times than not you’ll find the best bite while the tide is going out, but as long as the water is moving it’s worth giving a try. \nOddly, most of the kings that show up in Pensacola Bay are decent size and you’ll rarely catch one that is not legal to keep. The minimum size length for king mackerel is 24 inches to the fork, and the bag limit is two per person, per day. \nFor those who like a little competition there is a tournament held each fall to crown the angler who catches the largest king mackerel in Pensacola Bay. \nThe King of the Bay Tournament started on Sept. 19, but participants have until Oct. 31 to bring in their catch. \nFor a king to be eligible for the tournament it must be caught in Pensacola Bay inside of buoys 10 and 11. Anglers may fish from a boat or any bridge or pier in Pensacola Bay. \nThe entry fee is $25 per person or $50 per boat and you can sign up at Tight Lines Bait and Tackle, also the location of where you will weigh your catch. \nFor more information on the tournament call Tight Lines Bait and Tackle at 433-2962. 7 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.pnj.com/1LiSdpu TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:17:37.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
