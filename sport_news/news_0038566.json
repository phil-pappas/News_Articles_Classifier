That’s because Xavier intercepted six passes, forced two turnovers on downs and two punts, recovered an NFA fumble and blocked a punt for a touchdown to spoil the Wildcats’ Homecoming with an 18-6 victory. It was ugly. Both teams entered the game with a host of injuries. Third-string quarterback Collin McCarthy started for Xavier (3-3), but aggravated a high ankle sprain he suffered last week on the opening drive, which brought in fourth-string sophomore Will Levis. “It’s almost like you’re going into a (junior varsity) game to some extent because you have all this inexperience and you don’t know what to expect from the players,” Xavier coach Sean Marinan said. “And he’s in the same boat.” Marinan was referring to NFA coach Jemal Davis. With starting quarterback Jawaun Johnson out for a second straight game, Davis turned to sophomore Shea McManaway. When McManaway was hurt in the third quarter, third-stringer Tyler Briggs entered. The inexperience at the quarterback position was on full display. The teams combined for 126 yards and seven turnovers in an opening half that was destined to be scoreless until Xavier’s Anthony Caramanica blocked a punt by Spencer Molkenthin. Ben Costello jumped on the ball, right on the edge of the white at the back of the end zone, to give Xavier a 6-0 lead 17 seconds before the half. “Huge,” Marinan said of the play. “We manipulated the clock right and special teams is important, look what it did for us last year (Xavier won the Class LL-Small state title). It was huge for us all last year.” Neither team capitalized well on turnovers or short fields, so the Wildcats had plenty of chances to get back in the game. With Briggs (9-for-16, 115 yards) in at quarterback late in the third quarter, NFA (3-2) finally put together a mistake-free drive to tie the score. Briggs completed four passes for 71 yards, and on fourth-and-goal from the 2-yard line, Peyton Whittaker (13 rushes, 28 yards) began falling a bit short on a run up the middle, but extended his right arm out with the ball to get it across the goalline. Seconds ticked by without a call from the referees about whether it was a turnover on downs or the tying score. “I was screaming, ‘I got in,’” Whittaker said. “Some of (the referees) were saying it was a fumble, and finally one of them came over and said it was a touchdown, which was a sigh of relief.” Page 2 of 2 - Owen Gonzalez shot out from the edge on the extra point attempt and blocked the kick. It was one of many big plays from the Xavier junior. In the first half, NFA running back DaiJonn Cummings (17 rushes, 63 yards) broke some tackles and had nothing but daylight in front of him as he ran down the left sideline. Gonzalez tracked Cummings down after 59 yards and tackled the back at the 20-yard line. NFA turned the ball over on downs on that drive. “I was probably a good 20 yards behind him — and this happened in the West Haven game where I had to sprint a good 60 yards — I had to prevent a touchdown. I just kind of had to do it,” Gonzalez said. Xavier took advantage of the fourth-quarter interception with a 42-yard drive that ended with a Glenn Cunningham 1-yard TD run. With the Wildcats down a touchdown with just 5:14 left, Gonzalez ended another drive with an interception and Cunningham (25 rushes, 129 yards) put the game out of reach with a 4-yard touchdown. John Sadak also had a pair of interceptions for Xavier, including one on the Wildcats’ final drive. “Those are the things that are going to happen when you’re young and inexperienced trying to make a play,” Davis said of the interceptions. “In terms of playing and just driving down field, I was really impressed with the kids.” Caleb Parker had two picks and Isaiah Price had one for NFA, who also played without starting running back Dejean General. “While obviously we’re disappointed we didn’t get the win, but also we’re excited because we’re down a lot of guys on injuries and we still fought and played with one of the best teams in the state,” Whittaker said. “We know that we can beat anybody when we’re healthy.” By Brett Poirier The Bulletin The Bulletin By Brett Poirier The Bulletin Posted Oct. 17, 2015 at 6:49 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:15:38.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
