Lawyers for the state say there are other avenues besides the contested consular identifications to get birth certificates. The judge said he'd rule later.\nDozens of families and children sued the Texas Department of State Health Services after local authorities refused various foreign identifications. The agency wants the suit dismissed.\nThe parents, from Mexico and Central America, aren't U.S. citizens, but the Constitution guarantees the right of citizenship to their U.S.-born children.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:26:15.537+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
