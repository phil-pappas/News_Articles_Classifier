Ludwig/USA TODAY Sports) \nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. - Six weeks in, the Bengals season has settled into a pleasant predictability, which is an amazing thing to say in the National Football League, home office of illogical. \nYou did see that Pittsburgh beat Arizona Sunday, right? Led by the always dangerous Landry Jones at quarterback, the Steelers put a 12-point hurt on the Cardinals. That outcome arrived a few minutes before Cleveland damned near beat Denver. You know the Broncos: Pedigreed defense, Hall of Fame quarterback, six games, six wins. Denver needed 70 minutes to beat the Browns. \nWinning is a weekly migraine for everyone in the AFC North, except the Bengals. Pittsburgh is an ugly 4-2, Cleveland is an exasperated 2-4. Baltimore is waiting for Draft Day. \nThe Bengals just keep rolling. Nothing fazes them. They rally from 17 down in the fourth quarter against Seattle, they let Buffalo hang around for a half. It’s all the same to them. Six weeks into the season, there is no team outside of Foxboro, Massachusetts, that is a surer thing. \nYou know, for example, that Marvin Lewis will not go 30 seconds into a postgame press exam without using the phrases “keep working’’ and “getting better.’’ You can bet your house that someone will use the word “weapons’’ in connection with the Bengals offense, because the Bengals offense is more destructive than bug spray at a roach convention. \nOpposing defensive coordinators face lots of bad choices. Sunday, the Bills chose to stop A.J. Green, which they did, mostly. The Dalton Gang simply pulled a different remedy from the medicine cabinet. This week, it was Marvin Jones. “You never know game in and game out whose turn it’s going to be,’’ said Jones, for perhaps the hundredth time. \nThis achieves good ends: It makes the Bengals as easy to defend as Little Big Horn. It also keeps all players sharp, and keenly aware they can be replaced. There is no carrot like the carrot of playing time. \nThe players have taken to the phrase “play our game.’’ Carlos Dunlap said the defense “just had to play our game’’ in the second half. Andrew Whitworth allowed that “at some point, the other team is going to make some plays and stop some drives’’ a concession he squashed by adding, “all we have to do is play our game.’’ \nThere were seasons around here, lots of ‘em, when any Bengal saying “play our game’’ without irony would have sent the world into spasms of laughter. Now, it sounds about right. \nWhile the Bengals keep working and getting better and selecting remedies and playing their game, they also start really believing all this stuff. It’s no longer just something to shovel at the heathen media, to avoid headlines. With every win, the clichés pump a little more iron. \nTake Sunday here in delightful Orchard Park, where the sun shines somewhere else most of the time. The Bills left the field at halftime down just 17-14, thanks to a half-ending 86-yard drive that the Bengals never should have allowed. \nIn assessing the Trap Game possibilities for this one, we failed to account fully for just how lacking the Bills really are. They didn’t have their best QB, Tyrod Taylor, who isn’t quite exceptional anyway. Their best receiver played on one leg for a half, then didn’t play at all. Their top running back played hurt. And so on. \nEJ Manuel was a nice college QB at Florida State, and was the Bills top pick in 2013. He’s a gamer, and he somehow kept Buffalo relevant for 30-plus minutes. But Manuel isn’t going to Honolulu anytime soon. The closeness of the halftime score didn’t sit well with the Bengals. “We gave (Buffalo) that spark,’’ said Reggie Nelson. \nAnd watered it immediately. The Bengals began the second half with a 90-yard drive, and followed it with a 78-yard drive. Lotta weapons, playing their game. Twenty plays, 168 yards, two touchdowns. Meantime, the defense held Buffalo to 40 yards in the third quarter. As Dunlap noted, “We settled down and stopped the run and (all together now) played our game.’’ \n(By the way: If you don’t have a serviceable quarterback in the NFL, you’ve got nothing. You really shouldn’t show up. Unless, of course, the other guys don’t have a serviceable quarterback, either. In which case, no one should show up.) \nGame, set, let’s-get-outta- here. In the second half, the Bengals treated the Bills like dandruff on a lapel. Is there a gnat in my eye? \nThey slide into the bye week with no worse than the league’s third-best point differential (plus-60). They have a roster that for now is freakishly healthy. More, the Bengals have such depth, they could absorb injuries that most teams could not, assuming those hurts were not to Andy Dalton or Geno Atkins or the emerging team leader Pacman Jones. \nNo telling what happens next. Predicting NFL games is a good way to lose your mind and your money. All we know is what we see. Right now, six weeks and six wins into it, we see the Bengals running neck-and-neck with sunrises and sales taxes, for predictability. Same ol’ Bengals, you might say. There is no bigger endorsement in the NFL. 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1LFKJxb TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T14:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:34:26.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
