The team said it would hold prices at 2015 levels on tickets purchased before Dec. 31; however, tickets will not be available for all games by that time. Fans will be able to purchase season tickets, tickets for groups of 20 or more, four-game Sox Pax, and \"select single-game tickets\" for games in April, May and September. Ticket prices will rise in 12 of 22 non-premium seating categories at Fenway Park. Areas where the prices will not change include the Budweiser right field roof deck, right field roof box terrace, upper bleachers, and all standing-room areas. In a press release, the club said that it had not raised ticket prices in four of the last eight seasons. However, according to the Team Marketing Report annual survey released in April, the Red Sox still had the highest average ticket price in Major League Baseball, at $52.34 entering last season, compared to an MLB average of $28.94.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:24:21.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
