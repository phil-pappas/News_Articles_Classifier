(Jason Miller / Getty Images) Broderick Turner Contact Reporter \nAny team in the Eastern Conference looking to stop LeBron James and his Cleveland Cavaliers from reaching the NBA Finals again better be prepared to compete at a high level against King James and his talented teammates, particularly Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. \nBut the Cavaliers are dealing with some injuries, so all is not lost for hopeful contenders Chicago, Atlanta, Toronto, Miami, and Washington â€” if they can jump on Cleveland early. \nIrving could be out until January recovering from surgery on a fractured left kneecap that he suffered in the NBA Finals. Cavaliers guard Iman Shumpert will also be sidelined until January after surgery on his right wrist. \nMeanwhile, James needed an anti-inflammatory injection to treat his sore back in the exhibition season. \nOn the plus side, Love has been playing in exhibition games and will be ready for the season opener Tuesday in Chicago after recovering from surgery to repair a dislocated left shoulder. \nChicago has depth and talent, with Derrick Rose, Pau Gasol, Jimmy Butler and Joakim Noah, but the Bulls also have some key injuries. \nRose suffered a fractured orbital bone next to his left eye early in training camp and will wear a mask to protect it, while Mike Dunleavy is expected to miss the first month of the season after lower back surgery. \nChicago also has a rookie head coach, Fred Hoiberg. But Hoiberg knows that Steve Kerr's Golden State Warriors won the NBA championship in his maiden voyage as a coach. \nThe Atlanta Hawks were the NBA's biggest surprise last season, producing the best record in the East (60-22). Still, Atlanta got swept by the Cavaliers in the conference finals, and many doubt that the Hawks can duplicate last season's magic. \nMiami missed the playoffs last season. But Chris Bosh, who missed 30 games because of blood clots in a lung, is healthy again. Point guard Goran Dragic and rookie forward Justise Winslow will give the Heat some speed and athleticism. \nThe wild card remains Dwyane Wade, 33, who has missed 61 games in the last three seasons because of knee problems. \nMeanwhile, the Wizards need young backcourt stars John Wall and Bradley Beal to carry their team. \nSo let's see who is up to the challenge against the big, bad Cavaliers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:08:55.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
