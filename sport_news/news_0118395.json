Senior Ralph Cuddemi is back after leading Canisius in goals (22) and points (32) last season.\nPenn State was 18-15-4, reaching the quarterfinals of the Big Ten tournament. David Goodwin is the Lions’ top returning scorer. He had 15 goals and 19 assists last season.\nThe most obvious connection between the two teams is Sabres and Bills owner Terry Pegula. HarborCenter was financed by Pegula. Meanwhile, Penn State plays its home games in the Pegula Ice Arena. Terry and Kim Pegula donated $88 million toward the construction of that facility.\nIn a Friday night game, Niagara dropped its opener at St. Lawrence, 5-2. Ryan Kuhn and Nick Farmer put the Purple Eagles ahead, 2-1, in the second period. But St. Lawrence then scored the next four goals to win going away. The Eagles continue their road swing Saturday with a game at Clarkson.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:37:37.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
